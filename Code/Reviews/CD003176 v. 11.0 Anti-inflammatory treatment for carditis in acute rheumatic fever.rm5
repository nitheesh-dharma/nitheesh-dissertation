<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2015-05-13 08:03:38 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This is an update of a review published in 2003 and previously updated in 2009 and 2012. For this latest update, the search was rerun on 17 October 2013, and no new studies were found. Rheumatic fever is a late complication of a type of throat infection caused by streptococcal bacteria. It is an immune system disease that can lead to inflammatory disease of the heart (carditis), joints, brain and skin. Carditis can cause heart failure and death. Various anti-inflammatory drugs have been used to treat carditis, including corticosteroids, aspirin and immunoglobulins (immune therapy using antibodies). No new trials were identified in this update. This review includes eight trials with 996 participants. Evidence shows little effect of corticosteroids over aspirin in preventing cardiac disease after one year (six studies, 907 participants, risk ratio 0.87, 95% confidence interval 0.66 to 1.15). Several steroidal agents such as corticotrophin, cortisone, hydrocortisone and dexamethasone were compared with aspirin before 1966, and prednisone and immunoglobulins were compared with placebo in studies from 1990 and 2001, respectively. Most studies did not report on adverse events, but those that did reported complications due to corticosteroids including weight gain, enlarged facial features and acne. Trials were generally old (six of the eight trials were conducted between 1955 and 1965), small and of poor quality and had high risk of bias. For this reason, results should be interpreted with caution.</P>

<P>No new studies were included in this update. Eight randomised controlled trials involving 996 people were selected for inclusion in the review. Researchers compared several steroidal agents such as corticotrophin, cortisone, hydrocortisone, dexamethasone, prednisone and intravenous immunoglobulin versus aspirin, placebo or no treatment. Six trials were conducted between 1950 and 1965; one was done in 1990 and the final study was published in 2001. Overall there were no observed significant differences in risk of cardiac disease at one year between corticosteroid-treated and aspirin-treated groups (six studies, 907 participants, risk ratio 0.87, 95% confidence interval 0.66 to 1.15). Similarly, use of prednisone (two studies, 212 participants, risk ratio 1.13, 95% confidence interval 0.52 to 2.45) compared with aspirin did not reduce the risk of heart disease after one year. Investigators in five studies did not report adverse events. The three studies reporting on adverse events reported substantial adverse events. However, all results should be interpreted with caution because of the age of the studies and the substantial risk of bias.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2015-05-13 07:59:22 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Little evidence of benefit was found when corticosteroids or intravenous immunoglobulins were used to reduce the risk of heart valve lesions in patients with acute rheumatic fever. The antiquity of most of the trials restricted adequate statistical analysis of the data and acceptable assessment of clinical outcomes by current standards. In addition, risk of bias was substantial, so results should be viewed with caution. New randomised controlled trials in patients with acute rheumatic fever are warranted to assess the effects of corticosteroids such as oral prednisone and intravenous methylprednisolone and the effects of other new anti-inflammatory agents. Advances in echocardiography will allow more objective and precise assessments of cardiac outcomes.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Pathogenesis</HEADING>
<P>Rheumatic fever is a delayed complication of pharyngeal infection with group A beta-haemolytic streptococci. Infection with this organism results in a diffuse inflammatory disease of the heart, joints, brain, blood vessels and subcutaneous tissue. Carditis is not seen at the time of the streptococcal infection and appears only after a latent period of about three weeks. This serves as evidence against the direct role of streptococcal products in the pathogenesis of rheumatic fever. This latent period parallels the time required for development of an immune response (<LINK REF="REF-Abraham-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Abraham 1991</LINK>). The molecular mimicry between certain parts of the streptococcus and tissues of the host may lead to a cross-reactive immunity, in which the immune system produces an antibody response to various components of the streptococcal organism, as well as to certain tissues of the patient, particularly the heart. Immunological hyper-responsiveness in some patients, together with disturbed helper and suppressor T-cell function, leads to a complex immune system disturbance, which results in acute rheumatic fever and consequent cardiac damage (<LINK REF="REF-Williams-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Williams 1982</LINK>). Further evidence of an immunological mechanism for the pathogenesis of acute rheumatic fever is found in the presence of myocardial and endocardial deposits of immunoglobulin and complement in these patients (<LINK REF="REF-Kaplan-1964" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kaplan 1964</LINK>). In addition, rabbit antisera against certain group A streptococci have been shown to react with human heart preparations, indicating cross-reaction between the streptococcus and the human heart (<LINK REF="REF-Kaplan-1963" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kaplan 1963</LINK>). More recently, the pathogenic role of inflammatory cytokines in rheumatic fever in the form of tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, interleukin (IL)-8 and IL-6 has been described (<LINK REF="REF-Yegin-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yegin 1997</LINK>). Substantial evidence pointing to the inflammatory nature of the disease has resulted in use of anti-inflammatory agents such as corticosteroids and aspirin to treat the disease. Newer therapies such as intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and pentoxifylline have been used to modulate cytokine expression and suppression of activated cytotoxic T cells (<LINK REF="STD-Narin--2003" TYPE="STUDY">Narin 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Voss-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Voss 2001</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Predisposition and susceptibility</HEADING>
<P>Occurrence and spread of the streptococcal organism are influenced by the age of the patient, seasonality and socio-economic conditions. A superimposed genetic predisposition also probably exists (<LINK REF="REF-Guilherme-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guilherme 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Olmez-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Olmez 1993</LINK>). Supporting evidence for an underlying immunological susceptibility for developing acute rheumatic fever is found in the higher antibody response observed in rheumatic patients compared with non-rheumatic individuals following administration of influenza vaccine, and the finding of isologous red blood cells in these patients (<LINK REF="REF-Barrett-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barrett 1984</LINK>). A non-HLA B cell antigen, known as the D8/17 lymphocyte alloantigen, has also been identified in patients with rheumatic fever (<LINK REF="REF-Ganguly-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ganguly 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Khanna-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Khanna 1989</LINK>). A test to detect this B cell antigen marker can aid in the diagnosis of rheumatic fever and can help detect siblings who are at risk of developing the disease (<LINK REF="REF-Herdy-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Herdy 1992</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Epidemiology</HEADING>
<P>The epidemiology of acute rheumatic fever and of its complication rheumatic heart disease has changed since the first assessment of its impact, as recorded in this review for the first time in 2003. The literature at that time indicated that more than 12 million people were affected by rheumatic fever worldwide and approximately 400,000 deaths annually result from rheumatic heart disease (<LINK REF="REF-WHO_x002f_ISCF-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO/ISCF 1995</LINK>). The incidence of rheumatic fever had declined in industrialised countries since the 1950s, with a recorded annual incidence of around 0.5 cases per 100,000 children of school age. A resurgence in the incidence of rheumatic fever has been reported in industrialised countries such as the intermountain area of the United States (<LINK REF="REF-Veasy-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Veasy 1987</LINK>). In developing countries, rheumatic fever appeared to remain an endemic disease, with annual incidence ranging from 100 to 200 per 100,000 school-aged children (<LINK REF="REF-Olivier-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Olivier 2000</LINK>). In South Africa, a survey of 12,050 school children in 1972 revealed a prevalence rate of rheumatic heart disease of 6.9/1000, with a peak rate of 19.2/1000 in children aged 15 to 18 years (<LINK REF="REF-McLaren-1975" TYPE="REFERENCE">McLaren 1975</LINK>). Rheumatic fever occurred at a much younger age in developing countries, and severe chronic valvular heart disease occurred earlier (<LINK REF="REF-Halim-1961" TYPE="REFERENCE">Halim 1961</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Padmavati-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Padmavati 1978</LINK>). The more recent estimate of the global burden of rheumatic heart disease publication in 2013 critically reviewed the previous burden of disease estimates, suggesting that very few populations worldwide have been sufficiently studied to allow for proper prevalence and incidence estimates. Nevertheless the number of definitive cases of rheumatic heart disease has been shown to remain relatively consistent in recent studies in multiple diverse populations, at a prevalence of three to eight per 1000 (<LINK REF="REF-Global-Burden-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Global Burden 2013</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Diagnosis of rheumatic fever</HEADING>
<P>The most commonly used criteria for the diagnosis of rheumatic fever include the modified Jones criteria (<LINK REF="REF-AHA-1965" TYPE="REFERENCE">AHA 1965</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Dajani-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dajani 1992</LINK>). Diagnosis depends on the presence of events classified as major and minor manifestations of the disease. Concern about over-diagnosis of acute rheumatic fever was the main motivation for the creation of the original Jones criteria almost 60 years ago (<LINK REF="REF-Jones-1944" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jones 1944</LINK>). To increase specificity, these criteria have been revised four times - in 1955, 1965, 1984 and 1992 (<LINK REF="REF-Shiffman-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shiffman 1995</LINK>). The latest revision of the Jones criteria (<LINK REF="REF-Dajani-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dajani 1992</LINK>) suggests that the probability of acute rheumatic fever is high when the following are found.</P>
<UL>
<LI>Evidence of a preceding streptococcal infection, usually measured by elevation of the antistreptolysin O titre together with:</LI>
<UL>
<LI>two major manifestations (arthritis, carditis, chorea, erythema marginatum and subcutaneous nodules); or</LI>
<LI>one major and two minor manifestations (fever, arthralgia, high C-reactive protein (CRP) or elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and a prolonged PR interval on electrocardiogram).</LI>
</UL>
</UL>
<P>CRP and ESR are also helpful for monitoring inflammatory activity in patients with acute rheumatic fever. However, the ESR does vary according to erythrocyte count and the presence of concomitant heart failure.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Carditis</HEADING>
<P>Carditis, the most serious major manifestation of rheumatic fever, may culminate in chronic valvular disease and can lead to heart failure and, ultimately, death. Carditis usually has no associated symptoms and often is identified only during clinical examination of a patient who presents with fever, arthritis or chorea (involuntary, jerky movements of the limbs). Clinical features reflect involvement of various layers of the heart, viz, endocardium, including the valves, the myocardium or the pericardium, and frequently all three layers of the heart. The heart valves are the most commonly affected structures. The presence or absence of carditis is an important determinant of the course and prognosis of acute rheumatic fever. The prognosis worsens with increasing severity of the initial carditis and with recurrences (<LINK REF="REF-El_x002d_Said-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">El-Said 1998</LINK>). Bed rest contributes to reduced rheumatic activity (<LINK REF="REF-Barlow-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barlow 1990</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Valvular sequelae</HEADING>
<P>Rheumatic fever complicates untreated group A beta-haemolytic streptococcal infection in 0.1% to 0.3% of the general population and in 3% of epidemics in closed communities (<LINK REF="REF-Siegel-1961" TYPE="REFERENCE">Siegel 1961</LINK>); second episode attack rates as high as 65% have been reported (<LINK REF="REF-Taranta-1964" TYPE="REFERENCE">Taranta 1964</LINK>). Inflammation of components of the heart, such as the mitral and aortic valve leaflets and the chordae of the mitral valve, is the most common manifestation of rheumatic carditis (<LINK REF="REF-Ayoub-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ayoub 1995</LINK>). Recurrent attacks of rheumatic fever result in increasing damage to the valves. Damaged valves may regurgitate (fail to close properly and leak) or may become stenotic (fail to open properly). Mitral regurgitation is the most common heart defect (85%) identified in children and adolescents; it results from fibrosis and contracture of the valve leaflets, which prevents proper apposition during systole. The aortic valve is affected in 54% of patients, and the tricuspid and pulmonary valves in less than 5% (<LINK REF="REF-Markowitz-1972" TYPE="REFERENCE">Markowitz 1972</LINK>).</P>

<P>Open heart surgery is needed in patients with severely regurgitant or stenotic valve lesions. Heart valves can be repaired or replaced, if deemed to be non-repairable. Replacement of the valve with a prosthetic heart valve would require the patient to take anticoagulant treatment, usually in the form of warfarin, for life. The dosage of warfarin is crucial, and close monitoring of blood levels is needed to avoid thrombus formation on the prosthetic valve. Control of warfarin at therapeutic levels is a problem in developing countries, where many patients come from poor urban or rural settings with limited access to adequate medical care. In addition, the cost of heart surgery in patients with severely damaged valves is exorbitant and is a drain on the meagre health resources of poor countries.</P>

<P>Recommended therapies for acute rheumatic fever include bed rest, penicillin and anti-inflammatory agents.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Steroids</HEADING>
<P>At present, no clear consensus has been reached about the place of steroids in preventing rheumatic heart disease. Some practitioners recommend their use for patients with moderate carditis and heart failure (<LINK REF="REF-Abraham-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Abraham 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ayoub-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ayoub 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-El_x002d_Said-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">El-Said 1998</LINK>). Steroids have been shown to favourably affect clinical response while reducing the erythrocyte sedimentation rate. In addition, patients receiving steroids had a shorter hospital stay than those treated with aspirin (<LINK REF="STD-Human-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Human 1984</LINK>). Other reports suggest that heart failure in patients with active rheumatic carditis occurs as a result of a haemodynamically severe valvular lesion that can be corrected only surgically - not by giving steroids (<LINK REF="REF-Kingsley-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kingsley 1987</LINK>). Steroids are never a "lifesaving measure" in patients with a severe valvular lesion. It is argued that steroids are likely to make the tissues more friable and the task of the surgeon more difficult. Although steroids are used frequently, their use has not been shown to induce improvement in patients with fulminating rheumatic carditis (<LINK REF="REF-Barlow-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barlow 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kingsley-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kingsley 1987</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid)</HEADING>
<P>Controversy surrounds the value of aspirin in patients with rheumatic fever. Data from several studies do not show an advantage of steroids over aspirin in the treatment of patients with mild or moderate carditis. It is recommended that aspirin be used in patients with mild or moderate carditis, and that steroids be reserved for patients with severe carditis, particularly those with pancarditis and cardiac failure. Use of steroids in these patients is preferred because steroids produce a more prompt anti-inflammatory effect (<LINK REF="REF-Ayoub-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ayoub 1995</LINK>).</P>

<P>Rheumatic heart disease remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality in low-income communities (<LINK REF="REF-Olivier-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Olivier 2000</LINK>). It is clear that antibiotic treatment for streptococcal pharyngitis prevents the development of rheumatic fever (<LINK REF="REF-DiSciascia-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">DiSciascia 1980</LINK>), and that antibiotic prophylaxis prevents recurrence (<LINK REF="REF-Massell-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Massell 1988</LINK>).

Four participants were moved from the aspirin group to the prednisone group in <LINK REF="STD-CRFSG-1960" TYPE="STUDY">CRFSG 1960</LINK>. One participant was initially randomly assigned to the aspirin group and then was changed to the prednisone group because he was critically ill.

The number of participants with severe heart disease was small compared with the total number of participants.

Participants with severe heart disease in the <LINK REF="STD-CRFSG-1960" TYPE="STUDY">CRFSG 1960</LINK> study failed to improve with prednisone or aspirin (risk ratio therefore was not estimable). One study in which only nine participants had severe disease showed hydrocortisone to be more beneficial in reducing the severity of cardiac disease compared with aspirin after one year (RR 0.17, 95% CI 0.03 to 1.00) (<LINK REF="STD-Dorfman-1961" TYPE="STUDY">Dorfman 1961</LINK>).

<P>None of the included trials showed consistent benefit with the use of corticosteroids, aspirin or IVIG in ameliorating or avoiding cardiac disease one year after treatment among participants with acute rheumatic fever. The combined analysis of corticosteroid agents ACTH, cortisone, prednisone, dexamethasone and hydrocortisone indicated a weak overall favourable outcome in preventing cardiac disease compared with aspirin (random risk ratio 0.87, 95% confidence interval 0.66 to 1.15). Thus, the data do not provide sufficient quantitative evidence to support the use of corticosteroid therapy, IVIG or aspirin to prevent cardiac disease in patients with acute rheumatic fever, if they offer no compelling reason for selection of corticosteroids over aspirin or vice versa.</P>

<P>Both studies comparing anti-inflammatory agents, oral prednisone and IVIG versus placebo identified no benefit from the use of active agents (<LINK REF="STD-Haffejee-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Haffejee 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Voss-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Voss 2001</LINK>).</P>

However, in the light of the absence of evidence of efficacy of aspirin (no trial comparing aspirin with placebo), the significance of these results is unknown.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2015-05-15 07:24:44 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Type, dose and duration of corticosteroids and other medications varied between studies. Differences in outcomes between prednisone and hydrocortisone may be explained by the fact that prednisone is a less effective agent than hydrocortisone, or that corticosteroids need to be given for a longer period (12 weeks) to be effective, as was the case in the <LINK REF="STD-Dorfman-1961" TYPE="STUDY">Dorfman 1961</LINK> study.</P>
<P>In at least three of the trials (<LINK REF="STD-CRFSG-1960" TYPE="STUDY">CRFSG 1960</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-CRFSG-1965" TYPE="STUDY">CRFSG 1965</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-RFWP-1955" TYPE="STUDY">RFWP 1955</LINK>), participants 'crossed over' from one intervention to another. However, the meta-analysis was performed by using the original randomisation groups in an attempt to adhere to 'intention-to-treat' principles.</P>
<P>Only five studies included participants with severe cardiac disease and documented outcomes following treatment with steroidal agents, IVIG or aspirin. Overall 152 participants were included in this subanalysis of only data from <LINK REF="STD-Dorfman-1961" TYPE="STUDY">Dorfman 1961</LINK>, and the fewest participants (n = 9) showed a statistical beneficial outcome following administration of oral hydrocortisone. The inclusion criteria of <LINK REF="STD-Dorfman-1961" TYPE="STUDY">Dorfman 1961</LINK> did not include carditis, but methods of selection and assignment of cases appear to have resulted in satisfactory random assignment of participants with carditis to each group. Other severe outcomes such as death and the requirement for heart surgery were reported in only three studies (<LINK REF="STD-CRFSG-1960" TYPE="STUDY">CRFSG 1960</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Haffejee-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Haffejee 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-RFWP-1955" TYPE="STUDY">RFWP 1955</LINK>). Investigators reported a total of eight deaths and five participants requiring surgery, with five deaths and four surgical interventions occurring in the corticosteroid group. The data refute a life-saving role for corticosteroid therapy in patients with rheumatic carditis.</P>
<P>Secondary objectives of this review were to evaluate the effects of anti-inflammatory treatment on hospital stay and on erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein values. Reporting of these outcomes was too varied and inconsistent for adequate analysis. Corticosteroids appeared superior to aspirin in the rate at which ESR drops. However, this is not a compelling reason to choose one drug over another, as the significance of this rapid fall is not defined.</P>
<P>Five studies did not report on adverse events. The three studies that did so noted steroidal effects such as weight gain, moon face, buffalo hump, striae of the skin and acne and gastric ulceration. Participants in the aspirin group experienced tinnitus, deafness, nausea and hyperventilation.</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2015-05-15 04:34:03 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Limitations of the review process and potential sources of bias in this review include lack of intention-to-treat analyses in the original studies, along with antiquated studies and the small number of trials available for analysis. Statistical heterogeneity between studies was significant. Major differences between studies were noted regarding patient diagnosis, inclusion criteria, interventions (various types, doses used, duration), outcomes (mainly type of outcome, such as systolic murmurs, diastolic murmurs and "carditis") and methodology, such as lack of blinding in some studies. For all these reasons, results should be interpreted with caution.</P>
</POTENTIAL_BIASES>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2015-05-15 04:38:16 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Prednisone continues to be recommended in contemporary reference textbooks for patients with carditis and acute rheumatic fever (<LINK REF="REF-Ayoub-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ayoub 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-El_x002d_Said-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">El-Said 1998</LINK>). The recommended duration of steroid treatment differs from that used in the studies mentioned above, for example, <LINK REF="REF-Ayoub-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ayoub 1995</LINK> suggests 2 mg/kg/d of prednisone for two weeks followed by gradual withdrawal over the following two weeks, and <LINK REF="REF-El_x002d_Said-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">El-Said 1998</LINK> recommends 2 mg/kg/d of prednisone or prednisolone for three to four weeks. In addition, <LINK REF="REF-Ayoub-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ayoub 1995</LINK> suggests that aspirin should be used in patients with carditis for four to eight weeks at a dose of 90 to 100 mg/kg/d, depending on clinical response. A more recent review (<LINK REF="REF-Kumar-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kumar 2013</LINK>) indicates that no significant change has been reported in the management of acute rheumatic fever over the past 50 years, and suggests that anti-inflammatory agents such as aspirin and steroids, although they continue to be used to control rheumatic activity, do not cure rheumatic fever. The evidence base for these recommendations is clearly lacking.</P>
<P>Rheumatic fever and its valvular heart disease sequelae continue to be major causes of acquired heart disease in developing countries. Despite this, only one study was carried out in a developing country (<LINK REF="STD-Haffejee-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Haffejee 1990</LINK>), and the remaining seven studies took place in the USA, the United Kingdom and New Zealand. The number of randomised controlled trials examining treatment of acute rheumatic fever has diminished since the 1950s and 1960s in tandem with the decrease in prevalence of rheumatic heart disease in developed countries. The relevance and applicability to the current situation of data derived from studies performed 35 to 50 years ago in poorer countries remain pertinent because of the high incidence of rheumatic fever reported in industrialised countries during that period (<LINK REF="REF-Olivier-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Olivier 2000</LINK>).</P>

<P>Up to now, no evidence provided by the reviewed studies has supported the benefit of using anti-inflammatory drugs such as corticosteroids, intravenous immunoglobulins or aspirin to prevent or reduce cardiac disease in patients presenting with acute rheumatic fever. However, all findings should be interpreted cautiously, as most studies were conducted over 40 years ago and have considerable risk of bias.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2015-05-15 04:42:01 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Available studies have not established the efficacy of corticosteroids, intravenous immunoglobulins and aspirin. No published randomised controlled trials have examined anti-inflammatory treatment for acute rheumatic fever since 2001 (<LINK REF="STD-Voss-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Voss 2001</LINK>). Therefore a randomised controlled trial must be undertaken to compare aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents versus placebo. Once the effectiveness of aspirin has been established, comparison with corticosteroids becomes relevant. Further randomised placebo-controlled trials examining the more commonly used corticosteroids (e.g. prednisone, intravenous methylprednisolone) are warranted to establish whether any net benefit is obtained when these drugs are used. The availability and use of echocardiography and other newer technologies in future randomised controlled trials will assist greatly in providing more precise, valid and objective assessment of changes in cardiac lesions.</P>

<P>Acetylsalicylic acid (ASA)<BR/>Type of anti-inflammatory analgesic; also called aspirin.<BR/>
<BR/>ACTH<BR/>Corticotrophin.<BR/>
<BR/>Anticoagulant therapy<BR/>Use of anticoagulant drugs to reduce or prevent intravascular or intracardiac clotting.<BR/>
<BR/>Aspirin<BR/>Type of anti-inflammatory analgesic; also called acetylsalicylic acid (ASA).<BR/>
<BR/>Auscultation<BR/>Act of listening for sounds within the body.<BR/>
<BR/>Carditis<BR/>Inflammation of the heart, including pericarditis, myocarditis and endocarditis, according to whether the enveloping outer membrane, the muscle or the inner lining is affected.<BR/>
<BR/>C-reactive protein (CRP)<BR/>Blood test used as an indicator of acute inflammation. C-reactive protein is a protein of the pentraxin family, produced by the liver during periods of inflammation and detectable in serum in various disease conditions, particularly during acute phases of immune response. Normally C-reactive protein should be negative in the bloodstream.<BR/>
<BR/>Endocardium<BR/>Innermost lining of the heart cavities.<BR/>
<BR/>Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR)<BR/>Test that measures the rate at which red blood cells settle through a column of liquid. Non-specific index of inflammation.<BR/>
<BR/>Heart valves<BR/>One-way inlets or outlets between heart chambers that allow blood to be pumped in the appropriate direction. The heart has four main valves: tricuspid, mitral, aortic and pulmonic valves.<BR/>
<BR/>Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG)<BR/>Sterile solution of concentrated antibodies extracted from healthy people. IVIG is used to prevent bacterial infection in people with low or inappropriate antibody production. Injected into a vein or muscle.<BR/>
<BR/>Lesion<BR/>Any pathological or traumatic discontinuity of tissue or loss of function of a part.<BR/>
<BR/>Mitral valve<BR/>Heart valve that divides the left atrium and the left ventricle. During left atrial contraction, the mitral valve opens to allow blood to flow into the left ventricle. Upon closure, the mitral valve prohibits regurgitation of blood back into the left atrium. The mitral valve is the only heart valve that has only two valve cusps (all others have three).<BR/>
<BR/>Murmur<BR/>Noise found on physical examination of the heart that can, in some cases, indicate the presence of cardiac disease. Murmurs result from vibrations set up in the bloodstream and surrounding heart and great vessels as the result of turbulent flow.<BR/>
<BR/>Myocardial (Myocardium)<BR/>Term used to describe the middle layer of the heart wall (heart muscle).<BR/>
<BR/>Pentoxifylline<BR/>Drug that is a methylxanthine derivative with diverse pharmacological properties that cause inhibition of inflammation.<BR/>
<BR/>P-R interval (also called PQ interval)<BR/>In the electrocardiogram, time elapsing between beginning of the P wave and beginning of the next QRS complex; corresponds to the a-c interval of the venous pulse and is normally 0.12 to 0.20 seconds.<BR/>
<BR/>Pericardium<BR/>Double membranous sac that envelopes and protects the heart. Layer in contact with the heart is referred to as the visceral layer; the outer layer in contact with surrounding organs is the parietal pericardium. Between the two layers is the pericardial space.<BR/>
<BR/>Regurgitant heart valve<BR/>Valve fails to close properly and causes regurgitation of blood flow (flowing backward).<BR/>
<BR/>Salicylates<BR/>Type of anti-inflammatory analgesic; includes aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid).<BR/>
<BR/>Sequelae<BR/>Condition following as a consequence of a disease.<BR/>
<BR/>Stenotic heart valve<BR/>Heart valve fails to open properly.<BR/>
<BR/>Warfarin (warfarin sodium).<BR/>Oral anticoagulant used for prophylaxis of embolisation in rheumatic heart disease.<BR/>
