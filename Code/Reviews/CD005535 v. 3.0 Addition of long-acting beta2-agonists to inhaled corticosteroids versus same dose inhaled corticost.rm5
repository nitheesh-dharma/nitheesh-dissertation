This is reflected in Peer Review feedback. 90% of the data comes from trials in adults and this shows addition of LABA reduces the need for courses of OCS. The small number of children studied do not give a clear answer. In view of concerns relating to adverse events in studies in children the abstract, results, discussion and conclusion need to reflect the clear results in adults and uncertainty relating to children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Please could this review be tidied up in this respect in the same way that you did with Hi-AST?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chris Cates&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span modified=&quot;2010-01-13 09:44:00 +0000&quot; modified_by=&quot;Christopher J Cates&quot; class=&quot;inserted&quot;&gt;~&lt;/span&gt;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span modified=&quot;2010-01-13 09:44:00 +0000&quot; modified_by=&quot;Christopher J Cates&quot; class=&quot;inserted&quot;&gt;C&lt;/span&gt;JC Jan 25th Revised data checked.

Well done! I have looked through and before making further comments I think I should check the extracted data for the primary outcome. Would this be possible please?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chris&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bateman 2001 - is it appropriate to exclude this study from the review? It compares FP/SAL via different inhalers but there is also an arm with FP alone. In the original review it was excluded as the combination therapy was compared with different inhaler devices. Does the FP arm not fit with the eligibility criteria?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;---------------------------------------------&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;12012007&lt;br&gt;TJL: Jenkins 2006 - Data reported as mean differences and SEMs. I have managed to enter the data for the two arms by calculating the pooled SD for the treatment groups, and then entering these SDs with half the N in the control group. Confirmation from Chris that this is sensible would be very good I think! I have done this before where descriptive statistics are reported (i.e. mean &amp;amp; SD for three treatment groups), but when inferential stats are given I am less certain whether back-calculating a pooled SD reduces the power of the control adequately. Help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-------------------------------------------------&lt;br&gt;Exported from Review Manager 4.2.7&lt;br&gt;CJC edit on June 23&lt;br&gt;Peer review feedback on the metaregression is positive!&lt;br&gt;I have reworked the subgroup analyses using between group t-tests for the subgroups. I apologise for getting this wrong previously as you pointed out.&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;In the absence of heterogeneity, a priori subgroup analyses were conducted to examine the impact of the following variables on the magnitude of benefit observed with the addition of LABA (effect modification). Trends were observed between exacerbations and the severity of airway obstruction (outcome 02.01), [RRR 1.2, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.54] and the dose of inhaled steroids (outcome 02.03) (Chi2 7.41, df 3, P = 0.06) but they did not reach statistical significance. Although no significant protective effect of LABA was observed in the four pediatric trials contributing data to this outcome (RR= 0.90, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.42), the effect was not statistically different from the 12 adult comparisons (RR= 0.80 CI: 0.73 to 0.89 ) with a Chi2 = 0.5 (1df), P&amp;gt;0.10 (outcome 02.02). Dose of LABA (outcome 02.05) and type of LABA both showed significant differences between subgroups, RRR 1.4, 95% 1.0 to 2.0 for higher than usual dose and RRR 1.27, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.56 for Salmeterol, but it is difficult to interpret these results as they are not independent of each other. Use of one (N=1 trial) or two devices to deliver the combination of LABA + ICS (outcome 02.04), and trial duration (outcome 02.07) did not modify the protective effect of LABA. &amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;This is now ready for submission. Toby please create references for the ongoing Cochrane reviews in the discussion (Ram and Greenstone) and activate links. Please also run spell check.&lt;br&gt;Sorry for the delay in this and thanks for all your hard work.&lt;br&gt;Chris.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;=======================&lt;br&gt;Exported from Review Manager 4.2.7&lt;br&gt;Relook by CJC on 12 May 05&lt;br&gt;Thanks for making the changes below.&lt;br&gt;1. From a purist point of view Molimard should not be included but let us leave this (as you have asked) as the results are in keeping with the rest.&lt;br&gt;2. I have amended the Shapiro SD in outcome 1#7 second arm as well so the SD is now 0.45 not 0.05, you had already done this in 1#4. Could you check this has not altered the pooled result or other analyses please?&lt;br&gt;3. I have reread the Langton Hewer paper several times. It is clearly an outlier with results showing twice the effect of any of the other studies; this seems to be due to clinic FEV1 and PEF which are reported as change from baseline when there is clearly baseline imbalance. This is NOT supported by the home PEF data and is not presented as absolute levels. Also the 8 week data in the tables shows twice the effect of the 5 week clinic data. All this may be due to chance in a small study. I am happy to leave it in but add a caution re this trial's results. These were patients with such brittle asthma that they needed a special school and high doses of steroids so the classification of this study remains a problem ( I would regard the FEV1 as potentially misleading.&lt;br&gt;4. The NNT needs to stay as ONE YEAR because this is the baseline risk that I have used in the calculation. The OR or RR represents 4 to 52 weeks but this needs a baseline duration for application. I have therefore restored the one year (except in the discussion when RR and RD are contrasted). This reflects the difference between estimation (OR, RR,RD) and application (NNT).&lt;br&gt;5. My mistake for 1#7 this is fine if all are change from baseline.&lt;br&gt;6. I am happy with your response re cross-overs.&lt;br&gt;7. I have removed the unclassified subgroups and checked the Chi-2 for the subgroups. There are two that show significant differences using Peto OR, and these are LABA at higher dose (chi 4.19, df 1, P= 0.04) and LABA type (chi 4.26, df 1, P=0.04). The para on subgroups is therefore not correct as it stands. I HAVE LEFT THIS IS RED FOR YOU TO AMEND PLEASE.&lt;br&gt;8. On the basis of the above and on common sense grounds I have big problems with the meta-regression. It would suggest that those with 120% predicted fev1 get maximum benefit from LABA (clinically untenable), and as you point out the variables are all inter-related. Also trial level meta-regression may give misleading answers in comparison to IPD analysis. Again left in red for amendment?&lt;br&gt;9. I have toned down the discussion sentence on meta-regression to might be associated and taken the regression findings out of the reviewers conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think we are almost in agreement here. I am not sure how to best describe the meta-regression impact on the protective effect of LABA but the distribution of exacerbations is not usual normal, and we need to be careful about how readers extrapolate the regression findings. Without IPD the regression must be tentative and hypothesis generating only.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cheers,&lt;br&gt;Chris.&lt;br&gt;=======================================================================================&lt;br&gt;Editing by CJC 7 April 2005.&lt;br&gt;Commnets MNC April 24th&lt;br&gt;HI CHRIS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;THANKS FOR YOUR FEEDBACK AND COMMENTS.

All the results are presented in relative measures so the reader has no idea from the abstract of absolute treatment effects. ****I have added NNT here and also put a Visual Rx display in as figure 1. The NNT from the pooled OR is slightly different from the risk difference.&lt;br&gt;OK - WE ALSO MADE SOME ALTERATIONS IN RED.&lt;br&gt;MAIN RESULTS; REMOVED EXACERBATIONS &amp;quot;OVER ONE YEAR' AS THE DURATION OF TRIALS VARIED AND THE DATA WAS NOT STANDARDIZED ON 1 YEAR.

AS ABOVE, I BELIEVE THE SEVERITY WAS BASED ON POOR CONTROL DESPITE HIGH DOSES OF ICS AND/OR ORAL STEROIDS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;*** How did you deal with data from cross-over trials?&lt;br&gt;NORHAYA VALUES WERE ONLY EXTRACTED FROM PERIOD 1. SIMONS PROVIDED NOT DATA ON CONTINUOUS OUTCOMES BY PERIOD - WE ONLY USED THE DATA FOR EXACERBATIONS AND WITHDRAWALS. LEBLANC PROVIDED NO DATA BY PERIOD AND NO DATA COULD BE EXTRACTED. BY THE WAY, LEBLANC IS NOT DESCRIBED IN THE METHODOLOGY ASSESSMENT AS PER THE 2ND PARAGRAPH OF RESULTS WHERE WE MENTIONED THE STUDIES THAT WERE NOT DESCRIBED HEREAFTER BECAUSE THEY FAILED TO CONTRIBUTE ANY DATA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results:&lt;br&gt;****Comparison 2#1I am very sorry to say that RR cannot be used to perform the Chi test as described by Deeks as the pooling does not use inverse variance. Peto OR can be used and is NOT significant. A t-test on the WMD for the first 2 subgroups is also NOT significant (RRR between groups is 1.19, 95% ci 0.91 to 1.54, P=0.2). The reporting of this comparison needs to be changed or removed completely please.&lt;br&gt;NO PROBLEM, WE HAVE CHANGED THE TEXT ACCORDINGLY.

<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2010-03-25 10:23:58 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The use of long-acting ß<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists (LABAs) as 'add-on' medication to inhaled corticosteroids is recommended for poorly-controlled asthma where asthma exacerbations may require additional treatment with oral steroids. The purpose of this review was to assess the efficacy and safety of adding long-acting ß<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists to inhaled corticosteroids in asthmatic children and adults. Based on the identified randomised trials, in people who remain symptomatic while on inhaled corticosteroids, the addition of long-acting ß<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists improves lung function and reduces the risk of asthma exacerbations compared to ongoing treatment with a similar dose of inhaled corticosteroids alone in adults. We could not find evidence of increased serious adverse events or withdrawal rates due to adverse health events with the combination of long-acting ß2-agonists at usual doses and inhaled corticosteroids in adults. This provides some indirect evidence, but not total reassurance, regarding the short- and medium-term safety of this treatment strategy. There have not been enough children studied to assess the risks and benefits of adding LABAs in this age group.</P>

<P>Two review authors independently assessed studies for methodological quality and extracted data. We obtained confirmation from the trialists when possible. The primary endpoint was the relative risk (RR) of asthma exacerbations requiring rescue oral corticosteroids.

</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2010-03-25 10:23:58 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Seventy-seven studies met the entry criteria and randomised 21,248 participants (4625 children and 16,623 adults). Participants were generally symptomatic at baseline with moderate airway obstruction despite their current ICS regimen. Formoterol or salmeterol were most frequently added to low-dose ICS (200 to 400 µg/day of beclomethasone (BDP) or equivalent) in 49% of the studies. The addition of a daily LABA to ICS reduced the risk of exacerbations requiring oral steroids by 23% from 15% to 11% (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.68 to 0.87, 28 studies, 6808 participants). The number needed to treat with the addition of LABA to prevent one use of rescue oral corticosteroids is 41 (29, 72), although the event rates in the ICS groups varied between 0% and 38%. Studies recruiting adults dominated the analysis (6203 adult participants versus 605 children). The subgroup estimate for paediatric studies was not statistically significant (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.39) and includes the possibility of the superiority of ICS alone in children. </P>
<P>Higher than usual dose of LABA was associated with significantly less benefit. The difference in the relative risk of serious adverse events with LABA was not statistically significant from that of ICS alone (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.30). The addition of LABA led to a significantly greater improvement in FEV<SUB>1</SUB> (0.11 litres, 95% 0.09 to 0.13) and in the proportion of symptom-free days (11.88%, 95% CI 8.25 to 15.50) compared to ICS monotherapy. It was also associated with a reduction in the use of rescue short-acting ß<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists (-0.58 puffs/day, 95% CI -0.80 to -0.35), fewer withdrawals due to poor asthma control (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.41 to 0.61), and fewer withdrawals due to any reason (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.75 to 0.87). There was no statistically significant group difference in the risk of overall adverse effects (RR 1.00, 95% 0.97 to 1.04), withdrawals due to adverse health events (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.26) or any of the specific adverse health events.</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2010-03-25 10:23:58 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In adults who are symptomatic on low to high doses of ICS monotherapy, the addition of a LABA at licensed doses reduces the rate of exacerbations requiring oral steroids, improves lung function and symptoms and modestly decreases use of rescue short-acting ß<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists. In children, the effects of this treatment option are much more uncertain. The absence of group difference in serious adverse health events and withdrawal rates in both groups provides some indirect evidence of the safety of LABAs at usual doses as add-on therapy to ICS in adults, although the width of the confidence interval precludes total reassurance.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2010-03-25 10:23:58 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>With the recognition of asthma as an inflammatory disease, the cornerstone of asthma management is the use of inhaled corticosteroids (<LINK REF="REF-Adams-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Adams 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-GINA-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">GINA 2007</LINK>). Inhaled ß<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists are powerful agents used to relieve the bronchoconstriction associated with asthma. They act by stimulating the ß<SUB>2</SUB>-receptors located in airway smooth muscle resulting in smooth muscle relaxation (<LINK REF="REF-Nelson-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nelson 1995</LINK>). Inhaled ß2-agonists can be differentiated by their onset and duration of action. Short-acting ß2-agonists, such as salbutamol and terbutaline, are hydrophilic and interact directly with ß<SUB>2</SUB>-receptors, leading to a fast onset of action with a duration of effect of six hours or less (<LINK REF="REF-D_x0027_Alonzo-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">D'Alonzo 1997</LINK>). Long-acting ß<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists (LABAs) provide longer symptom control, which is a particularly useful feature for preventing night-time symptoms. There are two main LABAs, namely salmeterol and formoterol. Salmeterol is highly lipophilic and diffuses through the lipid bilayer in muscle cell membranes to reach the ß2-receptors, explaining the slower onset and long duration of action (<LINK REF="REF-Nelson-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nelson 1995</LINK>). Formoterol, being less lipophilic, has a fast onset of action, similar to short-acting ß<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists, and is believed to be incorporated into the lipid bilayer to serve as a reservoir, accounting for its prolonged action (<LINK REF="REF-Nelson-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nelson 1995</LINK>).</P>
<P>Frequent use of short- or long-acting ß<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists generally indicates a significant inflammatory process that should be controlled with anti-inflammatory drugs such as inhaled corticosteroids. The role of long-acting ß<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists in the management of asthma has previously been debated (<LINK REF="REF-Ernst-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ernst 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Salpeter-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Salpeter 2006</LINK>). At present, the use of long-acting ß<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists as monotherapy clearly appears to be less effective than inhaled corticosteroids alone (<LINK REF="REF-Warner-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Warner 1998</LINK>), and has been associated with increased asthma deaths; these data resulted in an early trial termination (<LINK REF="REF-SMART" TYPE="REFERENCE">SMART</LINK>). A recent systematic review, combining data from studies where patients received long-acting ß<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists as monotherapy or adjunctive therapy to ICS, raised concerns regarding the safety of LABAs (<LINK REF="REF-Salpeter-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Salpeter 2006</LINK>). However, a subsequent commentary based on Cochrane Reviews strongly suggested that only the use of LABA as monotherapy was associated with the serious adverse health events, while the use of LABAs in combination with inhaled corticosteroids was protective (<LINK REF="REF-Ernst-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ernst 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>A previous Cochrane systematic review suggested that an increased risk of exacerbations may be limited to patients receiving long-acting ß2-agonists as monotherapy (<LINK REF="REF-Walters-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walters 2007</LINK>). Although all national and international asthma consensus statements recommend the use of long-acting ß2-agonists only in combination with inhaled corticosteroids (<LINK REF="REF-BTS-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">BTS 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Canadian-Paediatic-Asthma-Guideline-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Canadian Paediatic Asthma Guideline 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-GINA-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">GINA 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NAC-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">NAC 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NAEPP-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">NAEPP 2007</LINK>), some uncertainty remains regarding the safety of combination therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Cates-2009a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cates 2009a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cates-2009b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cates 2009b</LINK>).</P>
<P>In adults with unsatisfactory asthma control on inhaled corticosteroids, international guidelines clearly favour the addition of LABAs to low or moderate doses of inhaled steroids over other options such as increasing the dose of steroids or adding other agents. Variations across guidelines highlight ongoing uncertainties regarding the optimal use of LABAs as add-on treatment to inhaled steroids. First, the lowest dose of inhaled steroids to which LABAs could be considered as add-on therapy varies across guidelines. In adults, LABAs can be added to chlorofluorocarbon-propelled beclomethasone dipropionate (BDP) at a dose equivalent to or greater than 200 µg/day according to the American (<LINK REF="REF-NAEPP-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">NAEPP 2007</LINK>), British (<LINK REF="REF-BTS-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">BTS 2007</LINK>) and GINA guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-GINA-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">GINA 2007</LINK>); 400 µg/day or more according to the Canadian consensus statement (<LINK REF="REF-Canadian-Paediatic-Asthma-Guideline-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Canadian Paediatic Asthma Guideline 2005</LINK>); and 800 µg/day or more according to the Australian recommendations (<LINK REF="REF-NAC-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">NAC 2006</LINK>). Recommendations also vary by age group. In children aged five years and over, the addition of a LABA is recommended if inadequate control is achieved with 200 µg/day of BDP according to the British (<LINK REF="REF-BTS-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">BTS 2007</LINK>) and American guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-NAEPP-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">NAEPP 2007</LINK>); 400 µg/day according to the GINA recommendations (<LINK REF="REF-GINA-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">GINA 2007</LINK>); and 800 µg/day according to the Australian (<LINK REF="REF-NAC-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">NAC 2006</LINK>) and Canadian (<LINK REF="REF-Canadian-Paediatic-Asthma-Guideline-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Canadian Paediatic Asthma Guideline 2005</LINK>) statements. Secondly, the preference of adding LABA to inhaled steroids as 'step three' option over other alternative strategies varies by age. Indeed, the Canadian (<LINK REF="REF-Canadian-Paediatic-Asthma-Guideline-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Canadian Paediatic Asthma Guideline 2005</LINK>) and Australian (<LINK REF="REF-NAC-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">NAC 2006</LINK>) guidelines clearly favour increasing the dose of inhaled corticosteroid to 800 µg/day BDP-equivalent before adding LABAs, as favoured by the British (<LINK REF="REF-BTS-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">BTS 2007</LINK>) and American (<LINK REF="REF-NAEPP-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">NAEPP 2007</LINK>) guidelines. In infants and preschool-aged children, a LABA is not recommended as add-on therapy, except by the American guidelines which suggest LABAs as add-on to 100 to 400 µg/day of BDP or equivalent (<LINK REF="REF-NAEPP-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">NAEPP 2007</LINK>). Finally, the criteria for considering the addition of LABA are vaguely described as inadequate control with no clear instruction as to whether the severity of baseline obstruction, duration of use, type and dose of LABA, dose difference between ICS as monotherapy and combination therapy, number of devices to deliver combination therapy or atopy may be important factors. We sought to update our systematic review of randomised controlled trials in order to clarify ongoing uncertainties about the optimal use of LABAs as add-on therapy to inhaled steroids and the subgroups of patients that may benefit most from the intervention (<LINK REF="REF-Ni-Chroinin-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ni Chroinin 2005</LINK>).</P>

Twenty-eight (36%) studies recruited adults exclusively (&gt; 18 years); 24 (31%) recruited children and 21 (27% of trials) studies permitted the enrolment of an unspecified number of adolescents aged 12 years or more. In two trials the lower age cut-off was 15 years (<LINK REF="STD-SAS40036" TYPE="STUDY">SAS40036</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-SAS40037" TYPE="STUDY">SAS40037</LINK>).

<P>The long-acting ß<SUB>2</SUB>-agonist was formoterol in 42 (54%) studies and salmeterol xinafoate in 35 (46%). The overwhelming majority (N = 73) of studies tested recommended doses of the long-acting ß<SUB>2</SUB>-agonist (that is, salmeterol 50 µg twice daily, formoterol 6 or 12 µg twice daily). In four studies a higher than usual dose of salmeterol (100 µg twice daily in <LINK REF="STD-Boyd-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Boyd 1995</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Langton-Hewer-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Langton Hewer 1995</LINK>) or formoterol (24 µg twice daily in <LINK REF="STD-SD-039-0728" TYPE="STUDY">SD 039 0728</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-van-der-Molen-1997" TYPE="STUDY">van der Molen 1997</LINK>) was used.</P>

<P>Within each study the dose of inhaled corticosteroid to which LABA was added was similar to ICS monotherapy in the control groups and fixed for all patients. It was a uniform dose in 57 (73%) studies and a range or unspecified dose for the remaining 20 studies. Of the studies assessing LABA in conjunction with fixed-dose ICS, 36 (49%) tested the addition of LABA to low-dose inhaled corticosteroids (200 to 400 µg/day of beclomethasone, or equivalent), five (7%) added LABA to a medium dose of ICS (401 to 799 µg/day of beclomethasone, or equivalent) and 16 (21%) studies used a high dose of ICS (800 µg/day or more of beclomethasone, or equivalent). LABA was added to budesonide (31 studies), beclomethasone (four studies) budesonide or beclomethasone (one study) or fluticasone propionate (22 studies).

<P>Thirty-four (44%) studies used two inhaler devices to deliver ICS and LABA, while 27 (42%) studies used one device. Five trials (represented by ten studies) tested both one and two delivery devices against inhaled steroids (<LINK REF="STD-Aubier-1999a" TYPE="STUDY">Aubier 1999a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Aubier-1999b" TYPE="STUDY">Aubier 1999b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jenkins-2006a" TYPE="STUDY">Jenkins 2006a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jenkins-2006b" TYPE="STUDY">Jenkins 2006b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Noonan-2006a" TYPE="STUDY">Noonan 2006a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Noonan-2006b" TYPE="STUDY">Noonan 2006b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pohunek-2006a" TYPE="STUDY">Pohunek 2006a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pohunek-2006b" TYPE="STUDY">Pohunek 2006b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zetterstrom-2001a" TYPE="STUDY">Zetterstrom 2001a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zetterstrom-2001b" TYPE="STUDY">Zetterstrom 2001b</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Wallin-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Wallin 2003</LINK> failed to report the number of devices used.

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Study duration</HEADING>
<P>The duration of the intervention in 43 studies (56%) studies was between 12 and 16 weeks. Sixteen (21%) studies lasted between four and eight weeks while the remaining 18 studies (23%) lasted from 24 to 54 weeks. Of note, only available data from the initial 12 weeks of the <LINK REF="STD-GOAL" TYPE="STUDY">GOAL</LINK> study were included to isolate the portion of this 52-week trial that corresponded to the specific criteria of this review, and thus ensure homogeneity of included trial protocols. Indeed, <LINK REF="STD-GOAL" TYPE="STUDY">GOAL</LINK> used three 'step up' phases, each of 12 weeks duration in the initial phase of the study, during which the dose of inhaled corticosteroids was increased until either total asthma control was achieved or a pre-specified maximal dose was achieved. Upon achieving pre-defined asthma control by the end of the 'step', participants entered the second phase during which the background fluticasone dose was maintained for the remainder of the trial. Since the dose of ICS varied upward after the initial 12 weeks, we extracted data for the first 12 weeks while on a fixed dose.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Permitted co-treatment</HEADING>
<P>Co-intervention with other prophylactic medications was explicitly permitted in six studies provided that doses remained unchanged throughout the trial. These included oral steroids, anticholinergics and xanthines (<LINK REF="STD-Langton-Hewer-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Langton Hewer 1995</LINK>), cromoglycate and xanthines (<LINK REF="STD-Norhaya-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Norhaya 1999</LINK>) and immunotherapy (<LINK REF="STD-Zimmerman-2004a" TYPE="STUDY">Zimmerman 2004a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zimmerman-2004b" TYPE="STUDY">Zimmerman 2004b</LINK>). Two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Ind-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ind 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Russell-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Russell 1995</LINK>) permitted co-intervention with other agents but did not mention specifically which drugs. Patients taking prophylactic medications were excluded in 16 other trials and this factor was unreported in the remaining trials. Rescue medications such as inhaled short-acting ß2-agonists and oral steroids were permitted in all the trials.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Outcomes</HEADING>
<P>Data for the main outcome measure, the number of participants with one or more exacerbations requiring oral steroids, were reported or were made available to the authors on request for 30 studies.</P>
<P>Most studies reported changes in lung function, use of rescue ß<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists, withdrawals due to any reason, withdrawals due to poor asthma control and overall adverse health events. There was a large variation in the way improvement in symptoms (symptom score, percent symptom-free days, percent days with symptoms, percent night awakenings) and use of rescue fast-acting ß<SUB>2</SUB>-agonist were reported, both using various parameters (average value, final value at endpoint, percent change and change in percent values). Wide variations in reporting prevented the aggregation of some of the available data.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Primary outcome: exacerbations of asthma requiring oral steroids</HEADING>
<P>Thirty studies (39% eligible studies) reported data for this outcome (two studies reported no events occurring in either group). The addition of a LABA to ICS therapy led to a 23% reduction (from 15% to 11%) in the relative risk of patients experiencing one or more exacerbations requiring oral corticosteroids (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.68 to 0.87, P &lt; 0.0001, N = 6808) (<LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK>). We did not observe any more statistical heterogeneity than would be expected due to the play of chance (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%). The result of the overall fail-safe N test was that 222 studies with negative findings would be needed to bring the estimate back to null (<LINK REF="REF-Gleser-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gleser 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>The overall number needed to treat to prevent one rescue oral corticosteroids was 41 (29, 72) based on studies of between four and 54 weeks duration, and a pooled control group event rate of 15%. However, the baseline risk (i.e. the control group event rate) of exacerbations requiring treatment with oral corticosteroids varied between the studies, with quartiles of low (0% to 2%), low/medium (3% to 6%), medium/high (7% to 23%) and high (23% to 38%) risk (<LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>).

<P>Sensitivity analyses by risk of bias (allocation sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding and completeness of follow up) did not alter the direction of the results and made little impact on the upper limit of the confidence interval (<LINK REF="CMP-002.09" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.9</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-002.10" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.10</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-002.11" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.11</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-002.12" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.12</LINK>).</P>
<P>Despite the absence of heterogeneity, we conducted <I>a priori</I> subgroup analyses to examine the impact of the following variables on the variance of the magnitude of effect observed (effect modification). There was no significant difference in the relative risks between subgroups based on airway obstruction (P = 0.20), age group (P = 0.53), dose of inhaled steroids (P = 0.34), type of LABA (P = 0.16), treatment duration (P = 0.13), number of devices (P = 0.45) or funding sources (P = 0.63). The effect in paediatric trials was not statistically significant (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.39) and the confidence interval not only encompasses the limits of the estimate from the adult studies, it includes possibility of significant benefit of ICS alone over LABA in this age group. There were differences between usual and higher than licensed doses which reached statistical significance in favour of usual LABA doses (usual dose: RR 0.74 (95% CI 0.65 to 0.84) versus higher than usual dose: RR 1.10(95% CI 0.79 to 1.52, P = 0.03) (<LINK REF="CMP-002.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.5</LINK>). The meta-regression suggested the independent effect-modifying effects of the LABA dose, baseline FEV<SUB>1</SUB> and treatment duration, where<SUB> </SUB>higher than usual dose, higher baseline FEV<SUB>1</SUB> or longer duration was associated with less benefit of combination therapy; all three variables were correlated (0.29 to -0.63).</P>
<P>There was no evidence of systematic bias identified by the test for funnel plot asymmetry (intercept 0.264, 95% CI -0.233 to 0.761). Since data for our primary outcome were not available in a number of full-text articles and had to be requested through correspondence, we undertook a sensitivity analysis to assess the robustness of the result to data source. We removed studies which were only available as short reports from manufacturer trials registers, or for which we had to correspond to obtain relevant data, leaving only those studies for which data were available in a full-text article. The resultant analysis restricted to published data gave a near identical result to the primary analysis (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.88) (<LINK REF="CMP-002.13" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.13</LINK>), although a funnel plot for this outcome did suggest some asymmetry without the unpublished data included (<LINK REF="FIG-04" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 4</LINK>). Since all but one trial contributing to the primary outcome was funded by manufacturers of LABA, we could not assess the impact of study sponsorship on the pooled effect size reliably.</P>

Withdrawal due to adverse events showed no significant difference between treatment options (RR 1.04, 95% 0.86 to 1.26, 52 studies) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.6</LINK>).<BR/>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2010-04-05 21:23:19 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The strength of the evidence allows us to confirm the efficacy of adding a long-acting ß<SUB>2</SUB>-agonist (LABA) to inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) in reducing the risk of exacerbations requiring rescue oral corticosteroids in adults. In children the evidence in favour of LABAs is far less certain, with wide confidence intervals including both superiority and inferiority of LABA to ICS alone. The studies have largely recruited adults and older children with suboptimal asthma control on monotherapy with inhaled corticosteroids. The addition of a LABA to ICS reduced the relative risk of patients requiring oral steroids for an asthma exacerbation by 23% (from 15% to 11%) in studies of four to 54 weeks duration. The efficacy of adding a LABA to inhaled steroids was also supported by several secondary outcomes, namely the significantly greater improvement in FEV<SUB>1</SUB> (by 110 ml) and morning PEF (20 litres/min), in symptom-free days (12%), in rescue-free days (6%) and a reduction by half in the risk of withdrawal due to poor asthma control compared to ICS monotherapy. The addition of a LABA was not associated with an increase in serious adverse events (SAEs), although the width of the confidence interval was large and could not exclude as much as a 30% increase in risk or a 13% reduction in risk of SAEs. There was no group difference in any documented specific adverse events with the wide confidence intervals around the estimates of risk for tachycardia or palpitation and death, indicating remaining uncertainty. However, the overall relative risk of adverse events between groups reached our <I>a priori</I> definition of equivalence, and there was no group difference in the rate of withdrawals due to side effects.</P>
<P>There was no evidence of statistical heterogeneity between trials in the primary outcome, despite the inclusion of populations of different ages, baseline severity of airway obstruction, use of different ICS doses and different LABAs. The overall number needed to treat (NNT) was 41 patients. We do acknowledge variation of baseline risk of rescue oral steroids between the control groups. When baseline risk is broken down further by quartile (see <LINK TAG="RESULTS" TYPE="SECTION">Results</LINK>), the highest NNT of 435 was estimated for studies with the lowest baseline risk (between 0% and 2%). These studies had a short duration (four weeks was the median), although mean baseline FEV<SUB>1 </SUB>was the lowest for all of the risk quartiles at 70%. As event rates in the control group increased across the medium and high-risk quartiles, the NNTs fell to 109, 32 and 17 respectively. Although the median study durations for studies in these risk quartiles were longer at 12, 26 and 24 weeks respectively, and the mean FEV<SUB>1</SUB> was higher (77%, 76% and 75 % predicted respectively), these two factors probably do not well identify the risk groups defined by the baseline rate of exacerbations. In view of the wide confidence interval from the paediatric studies the similarity of the subgroup estimates for the primary outcome could reflect lower statistical power for the studies in this subgroup than for the adult studies, with children representing less than 10% of the overall number of study participants (605 children versus 6203 adults).</P>
<P>While the results seem to apply to particularly to adults, irrespective of baseline characteristics and variation of intervention, the meta-regression and subgroup analyses both suggested that higher than usual dose of LABA significantly reduced the beneficial effect of LABA. Perhaps other factors such as baseline FEV<SUB>1</SUB> and treatment duration modify the magnitude of effect but until further confirmation it is safe to assume that the addition of LABA to ICS probably yields similar benefit irrespective of the baseline FEV<SUB>1</SUB>, starting dose of ICS, type of LABA, number of devices to deliver the combination therapy or treatment duration. Whether the addition of LABA to ICS is superior to increasing the dose of ICS is addressed in another review (<LINK REF="REF-Ducharme-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ducharme 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>The improvement in lung function with the use of LABAs might be anticipated from their physiologic action, although most studies obtained these measurements at the trough of the dosage interval (12 hours or more after the last LABA inhalation). Improvements were seen in all lung function tests (FEV<SUB>1</SUB> and PEF) whether measured in the respiratory laboratory or at home, in the morning or evening. While the addition of LABA reduced the need for rescue short-acting ß2-agonists slightly more than ICS, the effect was small: an average reduction of 0.58 puffs per 24 hours, -0.3 puffs/night and -0.68 puffs/day and a 6% increase in the percentage of rescue-free days. Similarly, a difference in the improvement of symptoms with LABAs was present but modest (SMD of between -0.2 to -0.3 for changes in symptom scores measured over 24 hours, day only or night only). Perhaps study eligibility criteria, which cited a requirement for frequent but not daily symptoms and short-acting ß2-agonist use during the run-in periods, explain this phenomenon. An alternative explanation may lie in the effectiveness of inhaled steroids alone for reducing symptoms and short-acting ß2-agonist use (<LINK REF="REF-Adams-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Adams 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Manning-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Manning 2008</LINK>), perhaps magnified by enhanced compliance to inhaled corticosteroids in the context of these studies.</P>
<P>When used without ICS, salmeterol and formoterol increase the risk of serious adverse events (<LINK REF="REF-Cates-2008a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cates 2008a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cates-2008b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cates 2008b</LINK>). In this review, the outcomes relating to hospital admission and all cause serious adverse events did not provide evidence that the combination of use of LABAs and ICS increased the risk of these serious events. Our findings lend qualified support to the commentary by Ernst and colleagues (<LINK REF="REF-Ernst-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ernst 2006</LINK>), which attributed the adverse effect of LABA reported by <LINK REF="REF-Salpeter-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Salpeter 2006</LINK> to its use without concomitant ICS. Due to the rarity of these events in the included studies, our pooled estimates were imprecise and the confidence intervals are not narrow enough to exclude either protection or harm confidently. This finding is concordant with separate analysis of salmeterol and formoterol as an additive treatment to ICS (<LINK REF="REF-Cates-2009a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cates 2009a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cates-2009b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cates 2009b</LINK>). Although the large confidence intervals around some other specific adverse effects highlight remaining uncertainties, the equivalence between groups in overall adverse effects is reassuring. Moreover, the absence of group difference in withdrawal due to adverse effects provides some support to the safety of adding LABA to ICS, when used up to 52 weeks.</P>
<P>The absence of data on airway inflammation that could be aggregated was disappointing. The concern that use of a LABA masks symptoms of poor asthma control and lead to deterioration of the airways is not supported by the evidence in our review. However, such a concern pertains to using a LABA as a steroid-sparing strategy, when used in combination with a lower dose of inhaled steroids than in the comparison group; in other words, when the dose of inhaled corticosteroids is not equivalent to both treatment options. With similar improvement in FEV<SUB>1</SUB> irrespective of study duration, there was no evidence of tachyphylaxis associated with prolonged use of LABA.</P>
<P>Our review provides complementary information to other reviews examining the overall efficacy of LABA in paediatrics (<LINK REF="REF-Bisgaard-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bisgaard 2003</LINK>) and in adults (<LINK REF="REF-Walters-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walters 2007</LINK>) when used as monotherapy and/or inconsistent co-treatment with ICS. There is enough power in our primary outcome to conclude firmly the efficacy of LABA as add-on to ICS when compared to a similar dose of ICS as monotherapy in adults: 222 studies with negative findings would be needed to reverse this finding. The efficacy of adding LABA to ICS applies to adults who are symptomatic on a ICS, as low as 200 µg/day of beclomethasone or equivalent. In view of the subgroup result for paediatric studies we cannot currently be sure how the overall effect applies to children, and the priority remains for researchers to generate a more definitive evidence base for the effects of this strategy in children.</P>
<P>The generalisability of the findings to a clinic population must be considered with care. One of the main eligibility criteria of the studies was the presence of significant (12% to 15% or more) reversibility in FEV<SUB>1</SUB> with a ß<SUB>2</SUB>-agonist. However, such reversibility is demonstrated in less than 10% of patients at a given point in time (<LINK REF="REF-Storms-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Storms 2003</LINK>). Major exclusion criteria included smoking, pregnancy or lactation, as well as childbearing age without appropriate contraception. This may have excluded up to a half of our usual clinic patients. Finally, patients with severe airway obstruction, recent exacerbations, or both, were generally excluded. To how many of our patients would the results of these aggregated trials apply? Unfortunately only a limited amount of data were presented in the trials on the proportion of participants randomised to those screened for enrolment in the run-in period. Only 34% of studies reported the proportion of patients enrolled in the run-in period that were successfully randomised (varying between 43% and 95%). There was little reporting of adherence to treatment during the intervention period, mentioned in only 13 studies, with no adjustment or stratification in the analyses. Whether treatment with LABA plus ICS leads to improved compliance and thus better asthma control than ICS monotherapy could not be assessed in this review. The results of this review may not be generalised to the majority of our patients and in particular those with symptoms but poor reversibility in FEV<SUB>1</SUB>.</P>
<P>Whether the addition of a LABA is more effective and safer than increasing the dose of inhaled corticosteroids (<LINK REF="REF-Ducharme-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ducharme 2010</LINK>), adding anti-leukotrienes (<LINK REF="REF-Ducharme-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ducharme 2006</LINK>) or whether it exerts a steroid-sparing effect (<LINK REF="REF-Gibson-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gibson 2005</LINK>) are addressed in other Cochrane Reviews.</P>

<P>In symptomatic adults with mild to moderate airway obstruction, who remain symptomatic despite a low, moderate or high dose of inhaled corticosteroids, the addition of a long-acting beta2-agonist at licensed doses is superior for reducing the rate of exacerbations requiring oral steroids, and for improving lung function, symptoms and quality of life, than remaining on similar doses of inhaled corticosteroids as monotherapy. There is little evidence to support this treatment option in children as a means of reducing requirement for oral steroids, precluding firm recommendations regarding the use of LABA for children. The available evidence indicates that the risk of serious adverse events between treatments is not statistically significant, although imprecision of the estimate includes the possibility of both an increase and a decrease in the risk of serious adverse events with the addition of a LABA in all age groups.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2010-03-25 10:23:59 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Given the nature of the evidence, preschool-aged children and school-aged children warrant further investigation. Similarly, patients who are symptomatic on inhaled steroids, despite good compliance, but with little airway reversibility to short-acting ß<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists should be targeted for inclusion in future studies. Stratified subgroup analyses on baseline FEV<SUB>1</SUB> and reporting effect size at different points in time would be useful to explore the potential modifying effect of these factors on response to therapy.</P>
<P>Future trials should be designed to take account of the following:</P>
<OL>
<LI>double-blinding, adequate randomisation and complete reporting of withdrawals and drop-outs with intention-to-treat analysis;</LI>
<LI>an intervention period of 12 weeks or more to assess properly the impact on exacerbations requiring oral corticosteroids;</LI>
<LI>clear reporting of the percent (and reasons) of non-eligibility of approached patients and of those enrolled in the run-in period;</LI>
<LI>complete reporting of continuous (denominators, mean change and mean standard deviation of change) and dichotomous (denominators and rate) data.</LI>
</OL>
<P>Outcomes of particular importance to assess include:</P>
<OL>
<LI>exacerbations requiring oral corticosteroids, to examine the effect of different patient characteristics, such as baseline lung function and baseline dose of ICS on this outcome;</LI>
<LI>careful monitoring and reporting of compliance to ICS prior to randomisation and to ICS and LABA post-randomisation. The impact of compliance to combination therapy versus ICS monotherapy on the magnitude of the effect size should be examined;</LI>
<LI>reporting of the cost-effectiveness of use of combination inhalers as compared to inhaled corticosteroids monotherapy;</LI>
<LI>long-term side effects of long-acting ß<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists.</LI>

<P>Studies to be included underwent quality assessment, performed independently by two review authors, using two methods. First, using the Cochrane approach to assess allocation of concealment, trials were scored using the following principles.</P>
<P>Grade A: adequate concealment.<BR/>Grade B: unclear concealment.<BR/>Grade C: clearly inadequate concealment.</P>
<P>In addition, each study was assessed using a 0 to 5 scale described by Jadad (1995) and summarised as follows.<BR/>1. Was the study described as randomised (yes = 1; no = 0)?<BR/>2. Was the study described as double-blind (yes = 1; no = 0)?<BR/>3. Was there a description of withdrawals and drop-outs (yes = 1; no = 0)?<BR/>4. Was the method of randomisation well-described and appropriate (yes = 1; no = 0)?<BR/>5. Was the method of double-blinding well-described and appropriate (yes = 1; no = 0)?<BR/>6. Deduct one point if methods for randomisation or blinding were inappropriate.</P>

<APPENDIX_BODY MODIFIED="2010-03-25 10:24:28 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The procedures for randomising GSK sponsored studies have been detailed in correspondence between Richard Follows and TL, the details of which are given below:</P>
<P>The randomisation software is a computer-generated, centralised programme (RandAll). After verification that the randomisation sequence is suitable for the study design (cross-over, block or stratification), Clinical Supplies then package the treatments according the randomisation list generated. Concealment of allocation is maintained by a third party, since the sites phone in and are allocated treatments on that basis. Alternatively a third party may dispense the drug at the sites. Unblinding of data for interim analyses can only be done through RandAll, and are restricted so that only those reviewing the data are unblinded to treatment group allocation.</P>
