<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2011-01-13 13:56:13 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Ruth Brassington">
<P>Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), also known as motor neuron disease (MND) and Lou Gehrig's disease, is a rare disease in which degeneration of motor nerves leads to progressive weakness and wasting of muscles. For the most part, the cause of ALS is unknown. In a small proportion of cases there is a family history of ALS/MND and in an even smaller proportion, the disease is known to result from a change in one of several genes including SOD1, TDP-43 and FUS. An understanding of the genetic basis for one familial form of ALS/MND has permitted the construction of an animal model of ALS/MND (the SOD1 mouse) that has been used extensively to study potential therapeutic agents for the human disease. None of the drugs found to be effective in the mouse have translated into therapeutic benefits for humans with ALS/MND. There are several possible explanations for this finding, one of which is that people with familial and sporadic ALS may respond differently to the same treatment and that the SOD1 mouse may be a better model of familial ALS (or at least familial ALS due to mutations in the SOD1 gene) than it is of sporadic ALS. In an effort to begin to address this question, this review was undertaken in order to ask whether or not people with the familial form of the disease respond differently to treatment compared to people with the sporadic (or non-familial) form of ALS/MND.</P>
<P>We identified all randomized controlled trials in ALS/MND and wrote to the authors to request the data needed to complete this review. Although many more studies were eligible for inclusion, only five authors were willing and able to share the data from their individual randomized controlled trials. Based on the analyses of these data, we find no evidence to support a statistically significant difference in the response to treatment between people with the familial and sporadic forms of ALS/MND.</P>

<P>Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), also known as motor neuron disease (MND), is a rare neurodegenerative disease. Approximately 5% to 7% of ALS/MND patients report a family history of a similarly affected relative. Superoxide dismutase-1 gene mutations are the cause in about 20% of familial cases.

<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2010-12-14 19:41:58 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>To systematically review the literature and to answer the specific question: 'Is there a differential response to treatment between people with sporadic and familial forms of ALS?'</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2010-12-14 19:41:58 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group Specialized Register, the Cochrane Central register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE and EMBASE for randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Two review authors read the titles and abstracts of all articles and reviewed the full text of all possibly relevant articles. We scanned references of all included trials to identify additional relevant articles. For all trials eligible for inclusion we contacted the authors to request the necessary raw data.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2010-12-14 19:41:58 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Studies had to meet two criteria: (a) randomized controlled study design, and (b) inclusion of participants with both familial and sporadic ALS/MND.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2011-01-17 12:55:11 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Ruth Brassington">
<P>We attempted to contact authors of all trials that met inclusion criteria. We obtained data regarding ALS/MND type (sporadic versus familial), treatment assignment (active versus placebo), survival and ALS Functional Rating Scale (ALSFRS) scores for included RCTs.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2011-01-17 12:55:18 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Ruth Brassington">
<P>Five RCTs involving 895 sporadic and 52 familial ALS/MND participants were included. There was no statistical evidence for a differential response to treatment in participants with familial ALS/MND compared to those with sporadic ALS/MND. The pooled estimate of the hazard ratio for the interaction term (treatment x familial ALS) suggested a more beneficial response with respect to survival among participants with familial ALS/MND, but the result was not statistically significant. Pooled estimates of the rate of decline on the ALSFRS suggested a slightly better overall response to treatment among those with familial ALS/MND, but the result was not statistically significant.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2010-12-14 19:41:58 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Based on the available data, there is little evidence for a differential response to treatment among people with familial and sporadic ALS/MND. Future randomized controlled trials should document whether people with familial ALS/MND are included and the presence or absence of a mutation in an ALS susceptibility gene amongst those with familial ALS/MND.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2011-01-17 13:31:55 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Ruth Brassington">
<P>Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), also known as Lou Gehrig's disease, is a neurodegenerative disorder, characterized by loss of motor neurons in the spinal cord, brainstem and cerebral cortex, that leads to progressive muscle weakness, wasting and ultimately death from respiratory paralysis within three to five years of disease onset. The term motor neuron disease (MND) is sometimes used synonymously with ALS, but may also be used as a more encompassing term that includes progressive bulbar palsy, progressive muscular atrophy and primary lateral sclerosis. Most cases of ALS are sporadic and the etiology is unknown. Familial ALS (fALS), defined by the presence of at least two affected family members (<LINK REF="REF-Valdmanis-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Valdmanis 2008</LINK>), accounts for approximately 5% to 7% of cases (<LINK REF="REF-Chio-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chio 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Forsgren-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Forsgren 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lopez_x002d_Vega-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lopez-Vega 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Norris-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Norris 1993</LINK>) and mutations in the Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase-1 (SOD1) gene are present in about 20% of people with fALS (<LINK REF="REF-Cudkowicz-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cudkowicz 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Orrell-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Orrell 1997</LINK>). More recently, mutations in other genes such as TDP-43 (<LINK REF="REF-Van-Deerlin-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van Deerlin 2008</LINK>) and FUS (<LINK REF="REF-Kwiatkowski-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kwiatkowski 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vance-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vance 2009</LINK>), have been identified as important causes of fALS.</P>
<P>The recognition that fALS may result from mutations in the SOD1 gene has led to the development of an animal model of ALS that has been used to examine the effects of potential therapeutic agents (<LINK REF="REF-Gurney-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gurney 1994</LINK>). Unfortunately, the success of these agents in prolonging survival in the SOD1 model of ALS/MND has not translated into effective therapies for people with ALS/MND. One possible explanation is that the SOD1 mouse is a better model of familial (or at least SOD1 positive familial) ALS than it is of sporadic ALS (sALS) and that people with familial and sporadic ALS may respond differently to the same treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Benatar-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Benatar 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>To the best of our knowledge there are no completed treatment trials that have specifically focused on people with fALS, but these participants were not always systematically excluded from the large multicenter treatment trials that have been performed in the broader ALS population (<LINK REF="REF-BDNF-Study-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">BDNF Study 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Beghi-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beghi 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bensimon-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bensimon 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bensimon-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bensimon 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Borasio-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Borasio 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-CNTF-Study-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">CNTF Study 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cudkowicz-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cudkowicz 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Desnuelle-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Desnuelle 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Groeneveld-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Groeneveld 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lacomblez-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lacomblez 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lai-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lai 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Meininger-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meininger 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Miller-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Miller 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shefner-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shefner 2004</LINK>). Within the last several years, however, three trials have been initiated (and are currently ongoing) that focus specifically on people with fALS due to mutations in the SOD1 gene (<LINK REF="REF-Arimoclomol" TYPE="REFERENCE">Arimoclomol</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-ISIS-333611" TYPE="REFERENCE">ISIS 333611</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Pyrimethamine" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pyrimethamine</LINK>). These include a phase II/III randomized controlled trial (RCT) of arimoclomol, a phase I/II open-label trial of pyrimethamine and a phase I RCT of intrathecal anti-sense oligonucleotides.</P>

Each dataset had information on familial versus sporadic ALS, ALS Functional Rating Scale (ALSFRS) (the older 10-item version with a scale of 0 to 40) and survival time.</P>
<P>For survival we used a Cox proportional hazards model to assess the following factors: treatment group (treated versus placebo), ALS type (familial versus sporadic) and the interaction between treatment group and ALS type with stratification by study. Stratification by study was necessary because different treatments were given in each study and survival was statistically significantly better in the NEALS celecoxib study than in the other four.</P>
<P>For ALSFRS, we fitted the data with a linear mixed-effects model. The model included fixed-effect terms for study, treatment arm, ALS type (familial or sporadic) and the interaction between treatment and ALS type. Random-effects terms for patient intercept and slope (rate of decline) were also included in the model.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Included studies</HEADING>
<P>Five studies are included in this review (see the '<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>' table). Four of these studies were included in the previous version of this review; the fifth is new to this update (<LINK REF="STD-Cudkowicz-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Cudkowicz 2008</LINK>). Each of these was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Four of these trials were conducted by the Northeastern ALS Clinical Trials Consortium in the United States and the fifth was conducted in the Netherlands. In two trials the active agent under investigation was creatine monohydrate (<LINK REF="STD-Groeneveld-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Groeneveld 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shefner-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Shefner 2004</LINK>). The active agents in the other three studies were celecoxib (Celebrex®) (<LINK REF="STD-Cudkowicz-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Cudkowicz 2006</LINK>), topiramate (Topamax®) (<LINK REF="STD-Cudkowicz-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Cudkowicz 2003</LINK>) and arimoclomol (<LINK REF="STD-Cudkowicz-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Cudkowicz 2008</LINK>). Each active agent was compared against placebo. Both active agents and placebo were administered orally in each study. Celecoxib was administered at a dose of 800 mg/day (<LINK REF="STD-Cudkowicz-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Cudkowicz 2006</LINK>), topiramate at the highest tolerated dose (maximum 800 mg/day) (<LINK REF="STD-Cudkowicz-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Cudkowicz 2003</LINK>), creatine in the NEALS study was dosed at 20 g per day for five days followed by 5 g per day (<LINK REF="STD-Shefner-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Shefner 2004</LINK>), and the dose of creatine in the Dutch study was 10 g per day (<LINK REF="STD-Groeneveld-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Groeneveld 2003</LINK>). Arimoclomol was administered at dosages of 75 mg, 150 mg and 300 mg per day (<LINK REF="STD-Cudkowicz-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Cudkowicz 2008</LINK>). The sample sizes of these studies ranged from 84 (NEALS arimoclomol study) (<LINK REF="STD-Cudkowicz-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Cudkowicz 2008</LINK>) to 300 (celecoxib study) (<LINK REF="STD-Cudkowicz-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Cudkowicz 2006</LINK>). The primary outcome measures were the rate of decline of arm megascore derived from the strength of eight arm muscles quantified using maximum voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC) in the topiramate (<LINK REF="STD-Cudkowicz-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Cudkowicz 2003</LINK>), celecoxib (<LINK REF="STD-Cudkowicz-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Cudkowicz 2006</LINK>) and NEALS creatine studies (<LINK REF="STD-Shefner-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Shefner 2004</LINK>), and event (death, tracheostomy and persistent assisted ventilation-free survival) in the Dutch creatine study (<LINK REF="STD-Groeneveld-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Groeneveld 2003</LINK>).

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Excluded studies</HEADING>
<P>People with the familial form of ALS were specifically excluded from 26 studies. A further 15 studies did not include any participants with familial ALS (fALS) even though the inclusion/exclusion criteria for these studies had not formally excluded this group of people. Four studies did not keep track of whether participants had sporadic or familial ALS and nine studies included fewer than four participants with fALS. Application of these filters yielded 38 RCTs. Repeated efforts were made to contact the lead, senior authors or both, from the publications describing these RCTs. Methods of contact included email, telephone, fax, mailing address and in-person requests where possible. No response to enquiries and requests for data was received for 17 studies. Eight authors replied, indicating that data were no longer available and a further eight refused to provide data (see the '<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_EXCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of excluded studies</LINK>' table).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Studies awaiting classification</HEADING>
<P>A further eight studies have been identified and are awaiting classification. Since the nature of this review requires contact with the authors of all trials to request original trial data, there is a inevitably a long latency from literature search to analysis of data. In the interest of maintaining this review current, a decision was made to proceed with publication based on trial data received, pending request and receipt of data from the most recent trials. The characteristics of these outstanding trials are summarized in the table entitled <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_AWAITING_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of studies awaiting classification</LINK>.</P>

<STUDY_QUALITY MODIFIED="2011-01-17 13:15:04 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Ruth Brassington">
<P>The five studies included in this review have a low risk of bias (see <LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK> and the '<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>' table). All were randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials in which the details of randomization sequence, treatment allocation and blinding were well described. Analyses were all by intention-to-treat and included almost all (if not all) subjects who underwent randomization. These studies included relatively small numbers of participants with fALS and they were not evenly distributed between the treatment groups. The small sample size might contribute to random variability but should not introduce a source of bias.</P>
</STUDY_QUALITY>
<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS MODIFIED="2011-01-17 13:29:53 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Ruth Brassington">
<P>In the five datasets there were 895 sporadic and 52 participants with fALS. The breakdown by study is shown in <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>. Overall, 5.5% of participants had fALS/MND (range 3.7% to 13%). The number of deaths in each study by treatment group and type is shown in <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK> and estimates for hazard ratios are shown in <LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK>. None of the hazard ratios for treatment effects were statistically significant, in agreement with the original studies. There were no deaths among fALS participants in either the treatment or control group in the NEALS creatine study (<LINK REF="STD-Shefner-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Shefner 2004</LINK>), so the hazard ratio for fALS could not be estimated. The interaction term, treatment x fALS, which tests whether the treatment effect differs for fALS compared to sporadic ALS (sALS), could not be estimated in the NEALS celecoxib (<LINK REF="STD-Cudkowicz-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Cudkowicz 2006</LINK>), creatine (<LINK REF="STD-Shefner-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Shefner 2004</LINK>) and arimoclomol (<LINK REF="STD-Cudkowicz-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Cudkowicz 2008</LINK>) studies (<LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK>). In the remaining studies the interaction term hazard ratio estimate was less than one for NEALS topiramate (<LINK REF="STD-Cudkowicz-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Cudkowicz 2003</LINK>) and greater than one for Groeneveld creatine (<LINK REF="STD-Groeneveld-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Groeneveld 2003</LINK>), but neither significantly differed from 1.0. Thus, there is no statistical evidence for a differential response to treatment in fALS compared to sALS.</P>
<P>By pooling the data and fitting with a Cox proportional hazard model stratified by study, we could estimate an overall hazard ratio for the interaction term (<LINK REF="TBL-04" TYPE="TABLE">Table 4</LINK>). The pooled estimate is less than 1.0 indicating that participants with familial fALS had a more beneficial response to treatment than participants with sALS . However, this estimated difference is far from reaching statistical significance (95% confidence interval 0.16 to 5.04).</P>
<P>Results from fitting the data to a linear mixed-effects model are summarized in <LINK REF="TBL-05" TYPE="TABLE">Table 5</LINK>. Estimated slopes of the rate of decline of the ALSFRS (points per month) are largely similar across the different studies, although their estimated intercepts differed (results not shown). One notable exception is the slope estimate among the seven people with fALS treated with arimoclomol (<LINK REF="STD-Cudkowicz-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Cudkowicz 2008</LINK>) in which the ALSFRS is estimated to decline by -0.26 points/month (95% CI -1.15 to 0.64) (<LINK REF="TBL-05" TYPE="TABLE">Table 5</LINK>). This rate of decline in non-significantly lower than the rates of decline amongst people with fALS in the other four studies (-0.84 to -1.64 points/month). Estimates for the differential treatment effect in fALS compared to sALS alternated in sign with an estimate of 0.36 for the pooled data. This also indicates a slightly better response to treatment in fALS compared to participants with sALS, although the estimate is once again not statistically significant (95% confidence interval for pooled effect ranges from -0.13 to 0.84).</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2011-01-17 13:08:32 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Ruth Brassington">
<P>This systematic review was undertaken in order to try to address the question of whether there is a differential response to treatment between people with the sporadic and familial forms of ALS/MND. It might reasonably be asked why this is an important question. The answer lies in the increasing recognition that ALS/MND may not be a single disease, but rather a syndrome of diverse etiologies and varying (although overlapping) clinical presentations. This is one reason for the relevance of asking whether people with the familial and sporadic forms of ALS/MND respond differentially to therapeutic agents. A second reason derives in part from the common practice of using data from the mouse model of ALS/MND, which is based on introduction of the SOD1 mutation into the mouse and which is perhaps more representative of familial than sporadic forms of ALS/MND. It might argued, for example, that a therapeutic agent that shows benefit in the animal model of the familial form of the disease might offer the greatest potential for benefit in human disease that is also attributable to a mutation in the SOD1 gene.</P>
<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2011-01-17 12:56:29 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Ruth Brassington">
<P>Two analyses were performed to address the question of whether or not there is a differential response to treatment among people with the familial and sporadic forms of ALS/MND. The first analysis was based on the primary outcome (survival). The second analysis was based on the rate of decline of the ALSFRS.</P>
<P>Estimates of the hazard ratios (HR) of response to treatment (comparing people with familial ALS/MND (fALS/MND) to those with sporadic disease) in the individual studies vary from 0.53 in the NEALS topiramate study (<LINK REF="STD-Cudkowicz-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Cudkowicz 2003</LINK>) to 2.7 in the Dutch creatine study (<LINK REF="STD-Groeneveld-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Groeneveld 2003</LINK>), suggesting no consistent difference in the response to treatment between these two groups. Using a Cox proportional hazards analysis that combined data from all five studies to estimate the hazard ratio for the interaction term (treatment x familial ALS) provides a means of directly addressing the question of whether treatment response differs between people with the familial and the sporadic form of ALS. The HR estimated using this approach was 0.90 suggesting a more beneficial response to treatment for people with fALS/MND, but the 95% confidence interval spans 1.0 (no difference) with a P value of 0.90.</P>
<P>In the second analysis using a linear mixed-effects model with data pooled across the five studies, a pooled estimate of the difference in slopes (rate of decline of the ALSFRS) suggests a slightly better response to treatment in people with fALS/MND, but again the results were not significant with the 95% confidence intervals spanning 1.0.</P>
<P>From the available data, therefore, there is little evidence upon which to base a definitive answer to the question of whether there is a differential response to treatment among people with the familial and sporadic forms of ALS/MND.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2011-01-17 13:08:32 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Ruth Brassington">
<P>In order to address the question posed by this systematic review it was necessary to contact the authors of all 93 published randomized controlled trials (RCT) for people with ALS/MND. This was a challenging undertaking given that these RCTs have been performed over a period that spans almost three decades. We were unable to obtain a response from the authors of 17 published studies, a significant number (n = 26) of studies deliberately excluded people with fALS/MND and a further 25, by chance, did not enroll any (or enrolled very few) people with the familial form of the disease. Data were either unavailable (n = 8) or the authors were unwilling to provide the raw data (n = 8) to permit the necessary analyses. Only five studies for which it was possible to obtain the raw data remained. This review, therefore, is hampered by significant missing data.</P>
</POTENTIAL_BIASES>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2011-01-17 12:56:32 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Ruth Brassington">
<P>Although there are currently three ongoing trials restricted to people with fALS/MND, there are no published therapeutic trials that have been restricted to this population. Similarly, we are not aware of any attempts outside of this review to extract and synthesize data on participants with fALS from previously published trials that have focused predominantly on participants with sporadic ALS.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2010-12-14 19:41:59 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is insufficient evidence from available trials to decide whether or not there is a differential treatment response between familial and sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/motor neuron disease (ALS/MND). In the absence of evidence for a differential treatment response, usual forms of treatment are warranted both for people with familial and sporadic forms of ALS/MND.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2011-01-13 17:07:40 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Ruth Brassington">
<P>The trend towards a slower rate of decline of the ALSFRS among people with familial ALS treated with arimoclomol is of considerable interest and warrants further investigation. The ongoing randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of arimoclomol in people with rapidly progressive familial ALS due to mutations in the SOD1 gene should illuminate this potentially interesting finding.</P>
<P>Future randomised controlled trials (RCTs) should clearly document (1) whether or not people with familial ALS are eligible for inclusion, (2) whether, and how many, participants with familial ALS are enrolled, and (3) whether participants with the familial form of ALS have mutations in an ALS susceptibility gene such as SOD1. ALS clinical trialists should search for an improved mechanism to permit sharing of data derived from RCTs. The availability of such data will permit an update of this review in the future and will perhaps permit a more robust answer to the question at hand.</P>

<P>The analyses presented here differ from those proposed in the original protocol for this review. In the original protocol we proposed methods for comparing survival proportions at 12 months post randomization. This turned out to be impractical for two reasons: participants dropped out prior to 12 months and there were no deaths in some treatment arms during the course of the study. Thus, we elected to use a Cox proportional hazards model with an interaction term specifically to test whether there were treatment effect differences due to ALS type. This is a more efficient way to analyze the data. For secondary, continuous valued measurements decreasing values over time made it difficult to compare means so we elected to compare slopes (rates of decline over time) using a linear mixed-effects model with an interaction term for effect x ALS type. Again, this was a more efficient use of the data.</P>
<P>The protocol also proposed analyses of the secondary outcomes of forced vital capacity and muscle strength but these analyses were not carried out since there were no data for them in some of the studies. The resulting reduced sample sizes plus the inherently greater within-patient variability of these measures compared to the ALS Functional Rating Scale (ALSFRS) led to our decision to only include ALSFRS as a secondary outcome measure.</P>
