<P>Intravenous clindamycin plus gentamicin is more effective than other antibiotics or combinations of antibiotics for treatment of womb infection after childbirth.</P>
<P>Inflammation of the lining of the womb (endometritis) can be caused by vaginal bacteria entering the womb (uterus) during childbirth and causing infection within six weeks of the birth (postpartum endometritis). Postpartum endometritis occurs after about 1% to 3% of vaginal births, and up to 27% of cesarean births. Prolonged rupture of the membranes (breaking the bag of water that surrounds the baby) and multiple vaginal examinations during birth also appear to increase the risk.</P>
<P>Endometritis causes fever, tenderness in the pelvic region and unpleasant-smelling vaginal discharge after the birth. It can have serious complications such as the formation of pelvic abscesses, blood clots, infection of the thin layer of tissue that covers the inside of the abdomen and abdominal organs (peritonitis), and whole body inflammation (sepsis). It is also an important cause of maternal deaths worldwide, although with the use of antibiotics, this is very rare in high-income countries.</P>
<P>There are many antibiotic treatments currently in use. This review compared different antibiotics, routes of administration and dosages for endometritis. The review identified 42 relevant randomised controlled studies, which are the most reliable type of medical trial for this type of investigation; 40 of these (involving 4240 women) contributed data for analysis.</P>
<P>The results showed that the combination of intravenous gentamicin and clindamycin, and drugs with a broad range of activity against the relevant penicillin-resistant bacterial strains, are the most effective for treating endometritis after childbirth. Women treated with clindamycin plus an aminoglycoside (gentamicin) showed fewer treatment failures than those treated with penicillin, but this difference was not evident when women treated with clindamycin plus an aminoglycoside were compared to women who received other antibiotic treatments.</P>
<P>There were more treatment failures in women treated with an penicillin plus gentamicin (one study) compared with those treated with clindamycin plus gentamicin. Seven trials showed that an antibiotic treatment that had poor activity against bacteria resistant to penicillin had a higher failure rate and more wound infections than an antibiotic treatment that had good activity against these bacteria.</P>
<P>There was no evidence that any of the antibiotic combinations had fewer adverse effects - including allergic reaction - than other antibiotic combinations. If the endometritis was uncomplicated and improved with intravenous antibiotics, there did not appear to be a need to follow the intravenous antibiotics with a course of oral antibiotics.</P>
<P>Overall the reliability of the studies' results was unclear, the numbers of women studied were often small and data on other outcomes were limited; furthermore, a number of the studies had been funded by drug companies that conceivably would have had a vested interest in the results.</P>

<P>The review includes a total of 42 trials, and 40 of these trials contributed data on 4240 participants.</P>
<P>Twenty studies, involving 1918 women, compared clindamycin plus an aminoglycoside (gentamicin for all studies except for one that used tobramycin) with another regimen.</P>
<P>When assessing the individual subgroups of other antibiotic regimens (i.e. cephalosporins, monobactams, penicillins, and quinolones), there were fewer treatment failures in those treated with clindamycin plus an aminoglycoside as compared to those treated with cephalosporins (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.99; participants = 872; studies = 8; <I>low quality evidence</I>) or penicillins (RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.90; participants = 689; studies = 7, <I>low quality evidence</I>). For the remaining subgroups for the primary analysis, the differences were not significant. There were significantly fewer wound infections in those treated with clindamycin plus aminoglycoside versus cephalosporins (RR 0.53, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.93; participants = 500; studies = 4; <I>low quality evidence</I>). Similarly, there were more treatment failures in those treated with an gentamicin/penicillin when compared to those treated with gentamIcin/clindamycin (RR 2.57, 95% CI 1.48 to 4.46; participants = 200; studies = 1).</P>
<P>There were fewer treatment failures when an agent with a longer half-life that is administered less frequently was used (RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.92; participants = 484; studies = 2) as compared to using cefoxitin. There were more treatment failures (RR 1.94, 95% CI 1.38 to 2.72; participants = 774; studies = 7) and wound infections (RR 1.88, 95% CI 1.17 to 3.02; participants = 740; studies = 6) in those treated with a regimen with poor activity against penicillin-resistant anaerobic bacteria as compared to those treated with a regimen with good activity against penicillin-resistant anaerobic bacteria. Once-daily dosing was associated with a shorter length of hospital stay (MD -0.73, 95% CI -1.27 to -0.20; participants = 322; studies = 3).</P>
<P>There were no differences between groups with respect to severe complications and no trials reported any maternal deaths.</P>
<P>Regarding the secondary outcomes, three studies that compared continued oral antibiotic therapy after intravenous therapy with no oral therapy, found no differences in recurrent endometritis or other outcomes. There were no differences between groups for the outcomes of allergic reactions.</P>
<P>The overall risk of bias was unclear in the most of the studies. The quality of the evidence using GRADE comparing clindamycin and an aminoglycoside with another regimen (compared with cephalosporins or penicillins) was low to very low for therapeutic failure, severe complications, wound infection and allergic reaction.</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2015-01-28 18:46:04 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The combination of clindamycin and gentamicin is appropriate for the treatment of endometritis. Regimens with good activity against penicillin-resistant anaerobic bacteria are better than those with poor activity against penicillin-resistant anaerobic bacteria. There is no evidence that any one regimen is associated with fewer side-effects. Following clinical improvement of uncomplicated endometritis which has been treated with intravenous therapy, the use of additional oral therapy has not been proven to be beneficial.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2015-01-29 13:04:19 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Sonja L Henderson">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2015-01-29 13:04:19 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Sonja L Henderson">
<P>The diagnosis of postpartum endometritis is based on the presence of fever in the absence of any other cause. Uterine tenderness, purulent or foul-smelling lochia and leukocytosis are common clinical findings used to support the diagnosis of endometritis. The American Committe of Maternal Welfare's standard definition for reporting rates of puerperal morbidity is an "oral temperature of 38.0 degrees centigrade or more on any two of the first 10 days postpartum or 38.7 degrees centigrade or higher during the first 24 hours postpartum". Alternatively, postpartum endometritis has been divided into early-onset disease occurring within 48 hours postpartum, and late-onset disease presenting up to six weeks postpartum (<LINK REF="STD-Wager-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Wager 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Williams-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Williams 1995</LINK>). Endometritis is diagnosed after 1% to 3% of vaginal births; and it is up to 10 times more common after cesarean birth (<LINK REF="REF-Calhoun-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Calhoun 1995</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2014-12-19 13:04:13 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The pathogenesis of endometritis is related to contamination of the uterine cavity with vaginal organisms during labor and birth and invasion of the myometrium. The presence of certain bacteria (e.g. groups A and B streptococci, aerobic Gram-negative rods, <I>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</I>, <I>Mycoplasma hominis </I>and certain anaerobic bacteria) in amniotic fluid cultures at the time of cesarean birth is associated with an increased risk of postpartum endometritis (<LINK REF="REF-Newton-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Newton 1990</LINK>). For vaginal births, the presence of the organisms associated with bacterial vaginosis (e.g. certain anaerobic bacteria and <I>Gardnerella vaginalis</I>) or genital cultures positive for aerobic Gram-negative organisms is associated with an increased risk for endometritis (<LINK REF="REF-Newton-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Newton 1990</LINK>). Prolonged rupture of membranes and multiple vaginal examinations have also been identified as potential risk factors (<LINK REF="REF-Gibbs-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gibbs 1980</LINK>). Women with bacterial vaginosis in early pregnancy have three times significantly higher risk of postpartum endometritis (<LINK REF="REF-Jacobsson-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jacobsson 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>Endometritis is usually a polymicrobial infection associated with mixed aerobic and anaerobic flora. Bacteremia may be present in 10% to 20% of cases. Unless a specimen is obtained from the upper genital tract without contamination from the vagina, or blood cultures are positive, there is seldom laboratory confirmation of the microbiological etiology of endometritis.</P>
<P>Complications of endometritis include extension of infection to involve the peritoneal cavity with peritonitis, intra-abdominal abscess, or sepsis. Septic pelvic thrombophlebitis, which can be associated with septic pulmonary emboli, can occur rarely as a complication of postpartum endometritis.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2014-12-22 15:37:06 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Before the advent of the antibiotic era, puerperal fever was an important cause of maternal death. With the use of antibiotics, a sharp decrease in maternal morbidity has been observed, and it is now accepted that antibiotic treatment for postpartum endometritis is warranted.</P>
<P>There are many antibiotic treatment regimens currently in use. An empiric regimen active against the mixed aerobic and anaerobic organisms likely to be causing infection is generally selected. Treatment is usually considered successful after the woman is afebrile for 24 to 48 hours. The spectrum of activity of clindamycin with gentamicin makes these antibiotics a popular choice for initial therapy and this combination is widely considered as the gold standard (<LINK REF="REF-Monga-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Monga 1993</LINK>). However, alternative treatment regimens for endometritis with different antimicrobial activity or pharmacokinetic profiles may be associated with differences in clinical effectiveness, side-effects or cost.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2014-12-11 00:26:35 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Roger E Packard">
<P>Determination of the appropriate antibiotic regimen to treat postpartum endometritis has multiple short and long term ramifications. Appropriate initial treatment may not only decrease maternal morbidity but may also improve antibiotic stewardship.</P>

</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2015-07-28 16:39:52 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The objective of this review was to determine, from the best evidence available, the effect of different antibiotic regimens for the treatment of postpartum endometritis on the rate of therapeutic failure, the duration of fever, the rates of complications, and the rates of side-effects of treatment. The effects of different drugs, routes of administration, and duration of therapy were sought. In addition, we sought to compare the effectiveness of regimens known to be active against the penicillin-resistant <I>Bacteroides fragilis</I> group of anaerobic organisms compared with those that are not.</P>

<OL>
<LI>treatment failures;</LI>
<LI>severe complications (including pelvic abscess and septic pelvic vein thrombophlebitis);</LI>
<LI>wound infections;</LI>
<LI>allergic reactions.</LI>
</OL>
<P>We used <A HREF="http://www.guidelinedevelopment.org/">GRADEpro</A> Guideline Development Tool to import data from Review Manager 5.3 in order to create 'Summary of findings&#8217; tables (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2014</LINK>). We produced a summary of the intervention effect and a measure of quality for each of the above outcomes using the GRADE approach. The GRADE approach uses five considerations (study limitations, consistency of effect, imprecision, indirectness and publication bias) to assess the quality of the body of evidence for each outcome. The evidence can be downgraded from 'high quality' by one level for serious (or by two levels for very serious) limitations, depending on assessments for risk of bias, indirectness of evidence, serious inconsistency, imprecision of effect estimates or potential publication bias.</P>

<P>In future updates, we will include cluster-randomized trials in the analyses along with individually randomized trials.

If we use ICCs from other sources, we will report this and conduct sensitivity analyses to investigate the effect of variation in the ICC. If we identify both cluster-randomized trials and individually-randomized trials, we plan to synthesize the relevant information. We will consider it reasonable to combine the results from both if there is little heterogeneity between the study designs and the interaction between the effect of intervention and the choice of randomization unit is considered to be unlikely.</P>

<P>We carried out statistical analysis using the Review Manager software (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2014</LINK>). We used fixed-effect meta-analysis for combining data where it was reasonable to assume that studies were estimating the same underlying treatment effect, i.e. where trials were examining the same intervention, and the trials&#8217; populations and methods were judged to be sufficiently similar. If there was clinical heterogeneity sufficient to expect that the underlying treatment effects differed between trials, or if substantial statistical heterogeneity was detected, we used random-effects meta-analysis to produce an overall summary if an average treatment effect across trials was considered clinically meaningful. The random-effects summary was treated as the average range of possible treatment effects and we discussed the clinical implications of treatment effects differing between trials.

<P>We did subgroup analyses for class of antibiotics for any other regimens in the comparison group.

When referring to penicillins, we included penicillin, ampicillin and extended spectrum penicillins. Monobactam refers to aztreonam. Aminoglycosides typically refer to gentamicin with the exception of one study that used tobramycin (<LINK REF="STD-Pastorek-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Pastorek 1987</LINK>). Lincosamides refer to clindamycin. For <LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>, the regimen typically included clindamycin plus gentamicin. A priori, we had planned subgroup analyses based on the presence of risk factors such as mode of delivery or genital tract infections, if an adequate number of studies were available. We planned a separate sub analysis including only those studies in which all participants had received prophylactic antibiotic treatment during cesarean birth, if an adequate number of studies were available. However, there were not enough studies available to perform the planned subgroup analyses. We also planned to perform sensitivity analyses based on methodological quality if necessary.

<P>The clinical criteria listed to define endometritis were consistent across trials. Febrile morbidity is a standard obstetrical outcome and was generally consistently reported, although there was some variation in the exact criteria used for height of fever, interval between febrile episodes and interval from the operative procedure. Urinary tract infection was usually defined as a positive urine culture; symptoms related to the urinary tract were rarely required to be present. Wound infection was diagnosed clinically and generally included induration, erythema, cellulitis or drainage. A positive microbiological diagnosis was rarely required for the diagnosis of either wound infection or endometritis. There was no consistent approach to the definition of serious morbidity. For this review, all episodes of bacteremia have been classified as serious, as have complications such as pelvic thrombophlebitis, pelvic abscess, and peritonitis. Some studies included other outcomes, for example the need for additional antibiotic use and other infections such as pneumonia. Some provided a measure of the fever as a 'fever index' which incorporated both the height of the fever and its duration.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-08-04 10:35:37 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The combination of clindamycin and an aminoglycoside was more effective than treatment with cephalosporins or penicillins as evidenced by fewer treatment failures. There were also fewer wound infections with clindamycin and an aminoglycoside as compared to cephalosporins. There were more treatment failures in women receiving gentamicin/penicillin compared with gentamicin/clindamycin. There is evidence that cefoxitin with a shorter half-life is less effective than the cephamycins with a longer half-life that are administered less frequently. Once-daily dosing of gentamicin was associated with shorter hospital stays than thrice-daily dosing. Regimens with poor activity against penicillin-resistant anaerobic bacteria had higher failure rates and more wound infections than regimens with good activity against these organisms. For all the other outcomes, there were no differences between treatment regimens. However, for many of these comparisons the numbers studied were small and, although unlikely, significant differences may not have been detected.</P>
<P>If the improved response with clindamycin and gentamicin compared with any other regimen is expressed as the number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB), 20 women (95% confidence interval (CI) 12 to 56) would need to be treated with clindamycin and gentamicin, rather than any other regimen, to prevent one additional treatment failure. What is missing from these studies, however, and what is needed to use the NNTB to help make treatment decisions, is a better assessment of side-effects of the regimens and reporting of the cost of the different therapies. No study looked at the effect of treatment on the infant of a breastfeeding mother and any maternal renal toxicity was not described systematically. Very rarely were drug costs collected and overall no attempt was made to collect and compare all costs of treatment, including length of stay.</P>
<P>For the other regimens that were compared, where there were no differences in treatment failures, it is unfortunate that there were so few data on other outcomes. These factors might determine whether a regimen, albeit equally effective, had some other advantage. As a minimum, drug costs should have been reported consistently.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2014-12-19 16:20:33 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Overall the studies were at an unclear risk of bias. There were opportunities for systematic bias: allocation concealment was usually inadequately described and only rarely was there any attempt at 'blinding'. Often the study was sponsored by the manufacturer of a new drug and this drug was compared with the control regimen, typically clindamycin plus gentamicin. But despite all these potential biases, which would most likely work against the control arm, the combination of clindamycin and an aminoglycoside was more effective than other regimens with fewer treatment failures and wound infections. However, for many of these comparisons the numbers studied were small and, although unlikely, significant differences may not have been detected.</P>
<P>Although there may be differences in the expected response of women who developed endometritis after cesarean birth compared with those who developed infection after a vaginal birth, insufficient data were provided to allow us to perform a subgroup analysis. We could not perform subgroup analyses based on the presence of bacterial vaginosis or genital tract cultures positive for virulent organisms, as the data were not available. There were too few studies to detect whether there are differences in outcomes between regimens when prophylactic antibiotics have been given for cesarean births. Many of the studies performed extensive bacteriological work-up on endometrial cultures, but this could not be approached systematically nor incorporated into this review.</P>

<P>The overall risk of bias was unclear in the most of the studies. We assessed the quality of the evidence using GRADE and judged the evidence for an aminoglycoside plus clindamycin with another regimen compared with cephalosporins or penicillins as low to very low quality for therapeutic failure, severe complications, wound infection and allergic reaction (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>). We downgraded scores as most studies had design limitations, few events, and wide confidence intervals crossing the line of no effect. Though drop-outs were reported with reasons explained, frequently, the number corresponding to each arm of a study was not given. For this reason we have provided analysis of available cases (rather than intention-to-treat). Many of the studies date back to the 1970s and 1980s. Since then there may have been changes in the causative organisms, as well as in the antimicrobial resistance profile.<BR/>

<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2015-01-27 21:25:26 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Very few studies have been conducted outside of the USA, with only four studies (from Central and South America) performed in the developing world. Since postpartum endometritis is an important cause of maternal morbidity and mortality in low-income countries, the lack of studies conducted in such environments leaves a gap in our knowledge.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Barza-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barza 1996</LINK> performed a meta-analysis of single versus multiple doses of aminoglycoside for the treatment of various infections, and the conclusions support a once-daily regimen.</P>
<P>Any study of a new drug for the treatment of endometritis should, rather than have as its only objective the demonstration of equivalence between the regimens, be designed to incorporate other relevant outcomes in the analyses, and ideally should incorporate some form of cost-benefit analysis. While concern about ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity are identified as contraindications to the routine use of an aminoglycoside in community-acquired intra-abdominal infections (<LINK REF="REF-Solomkin-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Solomkin 2003</LINK>), healthy women with postpartum endometritis, whose treatment course is usually short, could be assumed to suffer from less toxicity from aminoglycosides compared with other women who are more likely to have significant co-morbid illness. Although the studies included in this review did not collect information systematically on renal toxicity, there is no evidence that using an aminoglycoside in the clinical setting of postpartum endometritis should not be recommended because of toxicity. It is, however, important that any new regimen that is compared with clindamycin and an aminoglycoside should include ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity as outcomes.</P>
<P>There is evidence of increasing resistance in the <I>Bacteroides fragilis</I> group of organisms to clindamycin (<LINK REF="REF-Aldridge-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aldridge 2002</LINK>). While there are no data to suggest that this is having an impact on treatment outcome in women with endometritis, whose infections are generally uncomplicated, there should be ongoing surveillance of the effect of changing antibiotic resistance patterns. Although overall a regimen with activity against the <I>B fragilis</I> group is better than one without, 80% of women treated with a regimen without that activity were cured, raising questions about the type of woman in which a broad spectrum regimen is necessary.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2015-08-04 10:35:37 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>It can be concluded from this review that the combination of clindamycin plus an aminoglycoside (such as gentamicin) is appropriate for the treatment of endometritis and that a regimen with activity against the <I>Bacteroides fragilis</I> group and other penicillin resistant anaerobic bacteria is better than one without. There is no good evidence that any one regimen is associated with fewer side-effects. No specific recommendations can be made for the treatment of women who develop endometritis after receiving antibiotic prophylaxis for cesarean birth as we were unable to specifically study that population in this review. Also, it should be noted that none of the trials' regimens included ampicillin plus clindamycin plus an aminoglycoside, so we cannot make a recommendation as to whether these three antibiotics are superior to clindamycin plus gentamicin alone.</P>

Any further studies that compare clindamycin and an aminoglycoside with an alternative regimen, with efficacy as the primary outcome, should include regimens that are routinely used outside of North America and consider alternatives suitable for use in low-income countries.</P>
<P>With the availability of new antibiotics with improved oral bioavailability, novel ways of managing endometritis should be explored and more creative study designs should evaluate early switching to the oral route. Although the new quinolones have a broader spectrum of activity than ciprofloxacin and excellent oral bioavailability, and are used widely to treat intra-abdominal infections, it is generally recommended that they be avoided if a woman is breastfeeding, because their safety in breastfeeding has not been established. However, as more information on the safety of these agents in infants and children becomes available, their usefulness in treating women with endometritis should be studied. Any study of a new drug for the treatment of endometritis should, rather than have as its only objective the demonstration of equivalence between the regimens, be designed to incorporate other relevant outcomes in the analyses, and ideally should incorporate some form of cost-benefit analysis.</P>
<P>Traditionally an empiric regimen active against the mixed aerobic and anaerobic organisms likely to be causing infection is selected, but with increasing concern about the appropriate utilization of antibiotics and developing antimicrobial resistance, this approach may no longer be appropriate. We should ask whether the use of endometrial cultures, collected under conditions where contamination is avoided, has a role for targeting antibiotic therapy more specifically to individual women. Studies may be designed that compare different strategies for selecting an antibiotic regimen.</P>
