<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2010-12-08 13:32:49 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Bronchiolitis is the commonest respiratory infection in young children up to three years of age. It is commonly caused by respiratory syncytial virus. Children with bronchiolitis have a cough, fast and difficult breathing, nasal congestion, fever and wheeze. The disease is treated using drugs (bronchodilators and corticosteroids) and humidified air.</P>
<P>Humidified air as steam inhalation or mist is thought to help the patient by lightening respiratory tract secretions and relieving the symptoms of respiratory distress. We searched and reviewed studies that used humidified air alone or in combination with drugs to relieve the symptoms of the infection in children less than three years of age. We found only one study (156 children) that met our criteria for analysis. The study compared nebulised salbutamol and mist in a tent (humidified air). The results showed that nebulised salbutamol was effective in relieving respiratory distress in acute bronchiolitis in young children while mist therapy was not effective. The study did not report on adverse effects for either intervention. Although the study was of high quality, some issues regarding patient allocation to the various treatment groups were not very satisfactory. There is currently not enough evidence to state that steam inhalation or mist is useful in young children with bronchiolitis. More well-designed trials of the effectiveness of humidified oxygen, mist therapy or steam inhalation compared with other treatments for acute bronchiolitis are needed.</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2010-12-09 08:19:41 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Liz Dooley">
<P>Steam inhalation (or cool mist therapy) is commonly used to treat acute bronchiolitis in resource-constrained settings. One study was eligible for inclusion and found that nebulised salbutamol was an effective intervention for young children with bronchiolitis but mist in a tent did not lead to a significant decrease in RDS score. Since only one study was analysed it would be misleading to conclude that mist therapy is ineffective in children with bronchiolitis. We conclude that there is insufficient evidence to inform practice regarding using steam inhalation or mist therapy for acute bronchiolitis in children up to three years old.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2010-12-09 08:19:54 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Liz Dooley">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2010-12-08 13:33:02 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Bronchiolitis is an acute, highly communicable lower respiratory tract infection. It is the most common lower respiratory infection in children (<LINK REF="REF-King-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">King 2004</LINK>). Usually diagnosed in children under two years of age, it is commonly caused by the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Other viruses like parainfluenza, influenza and adenovirus have also been implicated (<LINK REF="REF-Nicolai-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nicolai 1990</LINK>). RSV infection occurs year round but epidemics are reported during the Northern hemisphere winter months, with peaks in January and February. Epidemics occur annually, leading to 100,000 hospitalisations in the United States at an estimated cost of $300 million (<LINK REF="REF-Levy-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Levy 1997</LINK>). In the Southern hemisphere, the highest numbers of RSV cases are also observed during winter, with a clear peak in July (<LINK REF="REF-Videla-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Videla 1998</LINK>). Near the equator, RSV infections occur all year round with a peak during the rainy season (<LINK REF="REF-Moura-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moura 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nwankwo-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nwankwo 1988</LINK>). The exact pathogenesis of RSV is not well understood (<LINK REF="REF-Aggarwal-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aggarwal 1998</LINK>). Physical examination findings are characterised by cough, nasal congestion (coryza), fever, expiratory wheezing, grunting, fast breathing (tachypnea), retractions and air trapping (<LINK REF="REF-Welliver-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Welliver 1992</LINK>). Complications include apnoea (temporary cessation of breathing) (<LINK REF="REF-Levy-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Levy 1997</LINK>). Mortality associated with primary RSV infection in healthy children is estimated to be between 0.005% and 0.02%. In hospitalised children the mortality rate is estimated to be from 1% to 3% (<LINK REF="REF-Aggarwal-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aggarwal 1998</LINK>). This may be because very ill children with complications are more likely to be hospitalised.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2010-12-09 08:19:54 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Liz Dooley">
<P>The use of humidified air either as a steam inhalation or as a cool mist for outpatient therapy is a popular and inexpensive means of achieving improved respiration in affected children (<LINK REF="REF-Nicolai-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nicolai 1990</LINK>). Steam inhalation is especially common in low-income countries as it is readily available at little cost to parents. It has been substituted in high-income countries by a cool mist which does not have the potential for burns, yet is still thought to have a therapeutic effect. In low-income countries this therapy is too expensive to be routinely utilised. It is significant that most infections due to RSV are mild and do not require hospitalisation (<LINK REF="REF-Aggarwal-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aggarwal 1998</LINK>). Since steam inhalation is a readily available therapy, it could be easily used at home to achieve an improved clinical status.</P>
<P>Hospitalised children with acute bronchiolitis are primarily treated with bronchodilators such as albuterol, salbutamol and epinephrine. Other treatments such as corticosteroids, secretolytic agents (to lighten respiratory tract secretions), humidified oxygen, steam inhalation and adequate hydration are also widely used (<LINK REF="REF-Wang-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wang 1996</LINK>). Ribavirin and RSV immune globulin antibodies are used to treat high-risk infants to prevent serious infections and also to treat immunocompromised patients. Though evidence for using bronchodilators has been established in various studies, it is the opinion of some that symptomatic therapy with bronchodilators may give only short-term relief of symptoms in some patients but has no effect on hospitalisation rates or duration of hospitalisation (<LINK REF="REF-van-Woensel-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Woensel 2000</LINK>). Corticosteroids have also been postulated to have no beneficial effect (<LINK REF="REF-Gonzalez-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gonzalez 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zhang-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhang 2003</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2010-05-18 10:55:45 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In bronchiolitis there is an infection and inflammation of the epithelial cells of the respiratory tract. This leads to the production of mucus which may obstruct the lower respiratory tract causing respiratory distress. The use of steam inhalation or humidified oxygen may act as a secretolytic agent to help lighten respiratory tract secretions and relieve the symptoms of respiratory distress. Supplemental oxygen is also used as a supportive therapy for hypoxia. In addition to increasing oxygen delivery to the alveoli, supplemental oxygen acts on the pulmonary circulation to increase pulmonary blood flow and reduce ventilation-perfusion mismatching that may occur in lower respiratory tract infections.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2010-03-11 16:18:38 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Humidified oxygen is used for inpatients who require oxygen therapy due to low oxygenation (<LINK REF="REF-Garzon-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Garzon 2002</LINK>). However, studies which indicate improvement in oxygenation and respiratory distress when using these means (<LINK REF="REF-Singh-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Singh 1990</LINK>) are contradicted by other studies which declare no significant change in the patients' condition (<LINK REF="REF-Makela-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Makela 1994</LINK>). This review intends to resolve this contradiction and recommend whether or not the use of steam inhalation or humidified oxygen for acute bronchiolitis in children is effective.</P>

<P>The results of included studies are described in the <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK> table. We based quantitative analysis of outcomes on the intention-to-treat (ITT) principle. We analysed each study individually to determine the risk ratio/odds ratio (RR/OR) for the pre-determined categorical outcomes, such as resolution of respiratory distress (which was our primary outcome), hospital admission and adverse events, for example, bronchopneumonia, respiratory failure, burns, death and death during treatment (if reported in the included studies). We used mean difference (MD) for continuous outcomes like respiratory distress symptom (RDS) scores, duration of hospitalisation, oxygenation level (assessed by 6th, 24th, 48th or 72nd hours of treatment, respectively) and time to recovery (if reported by included studies). We obtained an overall effect for those main outcomes using the random-effects model. At this time there is insufficient data to use the fixed-effect or random-effects model for meta-analysis.

<LINK REF="STD-Can-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Can 1998</LINK> enrolled 156 infants aged between seven weeks and 24 months who had had an episode of wheezing and other signs and symptoms of bronchiolitis. Participants were randomised to three groups as follows: (i) nebulised salbutamol, (ii) nebulised saline and (iii) mist in a tent. All three groups were administered oxygen during the procedures. Treatment was repeated with the same agent after 30 minutes if the respiratory score was five or more. The primary outcome measured was a decrease in the respiratory score. Respiratory rate, heart rate, oxygen saturation and presence of cyanosis, wheezing and retractions were recorded before and after each treatment. The results showed a significant decrease in respiratory distress symptom (RDS) scores in the group with salbutamol therapy and a decrease in RDS scores after 30 to 60 minutes in the group receiving mist therapy. This decrease was not significant when compared to the placebo group.<BR/>

<P>Demographic features of the study group show a high percentage of males in group II (placebo) as compared to group I and III (salbutamol and mist therapy). The P value for this was not indicated. All groups received humidified oxygen. A significant number of participants (19%) were treated with antibiotics which could confound the results. The distribution of participants with a history of prior antibiotic therapy across the intervention and placebo groups was not shown and it is not known if there was a higher proportion in the intervention groups. Antibiotics have not been shown to be effective in acute bronchiolitis but in patients with lower respiratory tract infections may result in improved symptoms. An effort was made to exclude individuals with atopy based on a history of previous attacks. However, 24% of the participants were diagnosed with atopy and familial atopy was present in 41%. The differences in the occurrence of atopy or familial atopy were not significant between study groups. Chest radiograph findings were more consistent with acute bronchiolitis in the study groups: salbutamol therapy (88%) and mist therapy (73%), when compared to the control group of nebulised saline (69%). This difference was significant between salbutamol therapy and the other two groups. Although this may lead to the conclusion that salbutamol has a greater effect that shown in the study, it may also decrease the ability to interpret differences in RDS scores obtained between the groups. It also decreases the generalisability of the study.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2010-12-09 08:20:19 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Liz Dooley">
<P>There is limited data available on the effectiveness of steam inhalation (mist therapy) or humidified oxygen for acute bronchiolitis in children up to three years of age. The results of one single-blind, randomised controlled trial (<LINK REF="STD-Can-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Can 1998</LINK>) are included in this review. The trial compared mist therapy, nebulised salbutamol and placebo (nebulised saline) for acute bronchiolitis. The results showed a significant decrease in RDS score with salbutamol compared to mist therapy and placebo. There was minimal improvement in the RDS score with mist therapy, particularly when compared with placebo. There were a number of potential confounders including the inclusion of atopic individuals and individuals with a family history of atopy, prior history of antibiotic therapy and chest radiograph findings that differed significantly between groups. The trial had other methodological weaknesses. The authors did not state the method of randomisation, so it is possible that allocation was not concealed and the assignment of infants to one or the other group could have been predicted. This may have allowed bias in allocation of infants that could have affected the outcomes independently of the intervention. It was stated that the study was designed as a single-blind, randomised trial, but it is not clear which individuals involved in the study were blinded. These challenges largely relate to the difficulty of isolating this population of infants from individuals with atopy or infectious causes of lower respiratory tract symptoms. See <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK> and <LINK REF="SOF-02" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 2</LINK>. There is inadequate data at this time to recommend steam inhalation, mist therapy or humidified oxygen as a sole therapy for acute bronchiolitis. There is a need for more well-designed trials of the effectiveness of humidified oxygen, mist therapy or steam inhalation when compared with other interventional therapies for acute bronchiolitis.<BR/>

</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2010-12-08 13:34:22 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There was a much larger number of atopic individuals enrolled in the study than would be expected. The higher prevalence of atopy may favour a greater response in the salbutamol group and indicate selection bias, making it difficult to retain the external validity of the study. There were also a greater number of males in the nebulised saline group, the significance of which was not reported, but which may have influenced the lack of response to nebulised saline compared to the other arms of the study. This may infer that the study results may be difficult to generalise.</P>
