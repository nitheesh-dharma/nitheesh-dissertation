<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) occurs when an artery near the heart and lungs stays open and does not close off after birth. Babies born early (preterm) have an increased risk of complications and death due to PDA. Indomethacin has been used to close the PDA; however, it can reduce blood flow in organs such as brain, kidneys and intestine. There is no agreement on the ideal dose and duration of treatment with indomethacin. In order to reduce the adverse effects of indomethacin on blood flow, some investigators have recommended administering the same total dose as a continuous infusion over 36 hours. In this review, the analysis of the two eligible trials found that the data was insufficient to reach a conclusion regarding the effectiveness of the 36-hr continuous infusion method. The blood flow lowering side-effects of indomethacin were reduced by the continuous infusion method, but there was insufficient data to recommend this administration method versus the traditional method. </P>

<P>Only two small trials comparing continuous vs. bolus indomethacin were eligible. Analysis of these studies showed that there were no statistically significant differences in PDA closure at day 2 (RR 1.57, 95% CI 0.54, 4.60) and at day 5 (RR 2.77, 95% CI 0.33, 23.14). There was no statistical difference between the bolus and continuous groups for the secondary outcomes of reopening of PDA, neonatal mortality, intraventricular hemorrhage and necrotizing enterocolitis. None of the trials reported on outcomes such as requirement for retreatment with indomethacin or surgical ligation, mortality, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, retinopathy of prematurity, neurodevelopmental outcome and isolated intestinal perforation.</P>
<P>The review demonstrated that there was a decrease in cerebral blood flow velocity after bolus injections and that the difference between the bolus and continuous infusion groups remained significant for 12 - 24 hours. Similar decrease in blood flow to the renal and mesenteric circulations following bolus administration was reported in one study (<A HREF="Christmann 2002">Christmann 2002</A>). None of the trials detected predefined levels of decreased urine output and increased levels of BUN and creatinine.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2010-02-19 12:17:28 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) is a common problem in the care of preterm infants. Failure of functional closure of the ductus leads to shunting of blood from the aorta to the pulmonary circulation as the pulmonary vascular resistance falls. The clinical consequences of a PDA are mainly related to the degree of left-to-right shunting through the ductus. Shunting results in alterations in blood flow distribution to the vital organs owing to a drop in diastolic pressure and localized vasoconstriction (<LINK REF="REF-Clyman-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clyman 1996</LINK>). Treatment may be necessary to prevent impaired organ perfusion that may result in serious complications such as necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) and bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) (<LINK REF="REF-Cotton-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cotton 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Clyman-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clyman 1996</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2010-03-08 12:58:51 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Indomethacin has been widely used for the prevention and treatment of hemodynamically significant PDAs (<LINK REF="REF-Friedman-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Friedman 1976</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Clyman-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clyman 1996</LINK>). It has been shown that prophylactic indomethacin in very low birth weight infants reduces the incidence of symptomatic PDA, the need for surgical PDA ligation, and the incidence of IVH, including grades 3 and 4 (<LINK REF="REF-Fowlie-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fowlie 2002</LINK>). Therapeutic indomethacin has been used in a variety of regimens to treat patients with symptomatic and presumed hemodynamically significant PDA (<LINK REF="REF-Nehgme-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nehgme 1992</LINK>) with a reported efficacy of 66 to 80% (<LINK REF="REF-Gersony-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gersony 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lago-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lago 2002</LINK>). Although indomethacin results in ductal closure in the majority of cases, it is ineffective in up to 40% of patients (<LINK REF="REF-Siassi-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Siassi 1976</LINK>). Additionally, the ductus will reopen in 35% of those infants who initially respond to the drug (<LINK REF="REF-Gersony-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gersony 1983</LINK>). PDAs that fail to close with indomethacin may require surgical ligation.</P>
<P>There are potential adverse effects of indomethacin use in premature infants. Indomethacin induces a significant reduction in cerebral (<LINK REF="REF-van-Bel-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Bel 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Austin-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Austin 1992</LINK>), mesenteric (<LINK REF="REF-van-Bel-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Bel 1990</LINK>) and renal (<LINK REF="REF-van-Bel-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Bel 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pezzati-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pezzati 1999</LINK>) blood flow velocities as measured by Doppler ultrasonography. These changes in organ blood flow, possibly caused by vasoconstriction, may result in impaired renal function and gastrointestinal problems such as spontaneous gastrointestinal perforation or NEC. Indomethacin can also cause decreased platelet function that might lead to coagulation disturbances. More recently, ibuprofen has been used with the same efficacy of indomethacin to close PDAs and was associated with fewer side effects (<LINK REF="REF-Shah-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shah 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-van-Overmeire-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Overmeire 1997</LINK>).</P>

<THEORY MODIFIED="2010-03-08 12:59:08 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Factors known to influence the effectiveness of indomethacin therapy and the incidence of adverse effects are dose, timing of administration, birth weight and age of the patient being treated. However, the relationship of response to serum concentration and dose remains uncertain (<LINK REF="REF-Ment-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ment 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shaffer-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shaffer 2002</LINK>). Dosage and duration of indomethacin treatment have been addressed in several studies (<LINK REF="REF-Brook-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brook 1995</LINK>). In one review, definitive recommendations about the preferred duration of therapy could not be reached based on a comparison of prolonged (four or more doses) versus short (three or less) courses of indomethacin (<LINK REF="REF-Herrera-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Herrera 2001</LINK>). A short 3-dose schedule has been widely used, but the optimal regimen of indomethacin has not yet been established (<LINK REF="STD-Christmann-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Christmann 2002</LINK>). The effects of altering indomethacin infusion rates on its efficacy and side effects have been studied in a small number of studies; however, the results remain controversial. A 30-minute infusion course compared to a rapid bolus (&lt; 30 seconds) course to ascertain the effects of indomethacin on cerebral blood flow velocities revealed inconclusive results (<LINK REF="REF-Simko-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Simko 1994</LINK>): the two study groups showed no significant differences in requirement of further indomethacin therapy or surgical ligation to close the PDA. In another study, the decrease in cerebral blood flow velocity after indomethacin injection was eliminated by administering indomethacin as a continuous infusion over 36 hours (<LINK REF="STD-Hammerman-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Hammerman 1995</LINK>). This study also demonstrated that continuous (36 hours) and rapid (&#8804; 1 minute) administration of indomethacin appeared to be equally efficacious in mediating ductal closure.</P>

<P>The search identified two studies that randomized infants less then 1750 g birth weight with PDA. Both studies compared the effects of a 36-hours infusion of indomethacin versus a course of rapid bolus administrations (<LINK REF="STD-Christmann-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Christmann 2002</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Hammerman-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Hammerman 1995</LINK>).<BR/>
<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Christmann-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Christmann 2002</LINK>: In this two-center trial 32 preterm infants (25 to 32 weeks gestational age) with echocardiographically documented PDA were randomized to receive the same total dose of indomethacin (0.4 mg/kg) either as three bolus injections or as a continuous infusion over 36 hours. In the bolus injection group, three intravenous injections were given rapidly within 30 seconds. The initial dose was 0.2 mg/kg followed by two doses of 0.1 mg/kg indomethacin at 12 and 36 hours after the first injection. Blood flow velocities of the internal carotid artery (ICA), renal artery (RA) and superior mesenteric artery (SMA) were measured before and at 10, 30, 60 and 120 minutes and 12, 24, 36 and 48 hours after initiation of indomethacin treatment. Echocardiographic assessments were done in a masked fashion by a cardiologist before and 24 hours after the completion of the treatment. Perinatal characteristics were registered. Primary outcome variables were PDA closure, reopening of PDA after completion of the allocated treatment, neonatal mortality, IVH, NEC and changes in blood flow velocities (ICA, RA and SMA) during indomethacin treatment. Other studied variables were BUN, creatinine, hemoglobin, hematocrit, platelet count, serum sodium, potassium, BUN, creatinine, blood gasses, ventilator settings, medications and exposure to phototherapy. Urine output and heart rate, arterial oxygen saturation, tc pO2, tc pCO2 and blood pressure were monitored continuously.<BR/>

<LINK REF="STD-Hammerman-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Hammerman 1995</LINK>: This two-center trial enrolled 18 preterm infants &lt; 1750 g (28 to 29 weeks gestational age) with echocardiographically documented PDA. Infants were randomized to receive indomethacin either by three rapid injections (an initial dose of 0.2 mg/kg followed by two doses of 0.1 mg/kg every 12 hours) or by continuous intravenous infusion (11 mcg/kg/hour) over 36 hours, providing an equivalent total dose. Blood flow velocity of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) was measured before and at four and 30 minutes and at 24 hours following completion of the initial infusion for the bolus group or the start of the continuous infusion for the continuous group by the investigator who was blinded to the group assignment. Echocardiograms were obtained daily for four days after entry to the study and then at one week of age. Perinatal characteristics were registered. Primary outcome variables were PDA closure, reopening of PDA after completion of the allocated treatment, IVH and changes in cerebral blood flow velocities during the indomethacin treatment. Other studied variables were systolic blood pressure, BUN and creatinine.</P>

<P>The study by Christmann (<LINK REF="STD-Christmann-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Christmann 2002</LINK>) showed that the mean flow velocities remained similar to baseline measurements in the continuous group; however, they decreased after the bolus injection.

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2010-03-08 13:02:22 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>An extensive literature search identified only two small trials eligible for this review. Considering the small number of events in these two trials, the data analysis was found to be insufficient to draw conclusions from most outcomes investigated. The analysis of the main outcome of "failed PDA closure" showed that the comparison slightly favored bolus versus continuous indomethacin on both day two and five. The findings were not statistically significant. Similar trends were noted for the secondary outcomes of reopening of PDA and neonatal mortality but did not reach statistical significance. The analysis of the outcome for NEC favored continuous indomethacin; however, the analysis was statistically insignificant. Comparison for IVH could not be estimated due to no reported cases of IVH in each group. For all the outcomes, the number of observed events were so few that no reliable statement about relative effectiveness of continuous versus bolus indomethacin administration could be made. Neither study reported on requirements for retreatment with indomethacin, surgical ligation of PDA, BPD, ROP, isolated intestinal perforation or neurodevelopmental outcome.</P>
<P>The current review demonstrates that bolus administration of indomethacin compared to continuous infusion caused a significant reduction in cerebral blood flow. The maximum decrease in cerebral blood flow velocity following the bolus administration took place within the first 30 minutes and was approximately 35 to 40% of the baseline values. The flow decrease started to improve after 30 minutes; however, the difference remained statistically significant until 12 to 24 hours post-administration. Although each study examined a different artery, namely ICA (<LINK REF="STD-Christmann-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Christmann 2002</LINK>) and MCA (<LINK REF="STD-Hammerman-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Hammerman 1995</LINK>), the results were similar. In premature infants, it has been shown that indomethacin can cause reductions in cerebral artery blood flow ranging from 25 to 60% as measured by Doppler (<LINK REF="REF-Mardoum-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mardoum 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Laudignon-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Laudignon 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Evans-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Evans 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-van-Bel-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Bel 1989</LINK>). Although it is not known at what level flow decrease should be considered dangerous, any significant drop in the cerebral blood flow is disturbing because it may be a contributing cause of brain underperfusion or ischemia in premature infants. It is hypothesized that a decrease in cerebral blood flow could potentially increase the incidence of periventricular leukomalacia. It has also been shown that this decrease of blood flow may be advantageous because it might lower the incidence and severity of IVH when indomethacin is used prophylactically (<LINK REF="REF-Ment-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ment 1993</LINK>). However, based on the current studies in the literature, it is impossible to determine the pathogenesis of ischemic brain damage and the clinical significance of indomethacin-mediated blood flow decrease in preterm infants.</P>
<P>In this review, only one trial with a small number of patients reported on the effects of indomethacin on mesenteric and renal blood flows (<LINK REF="STD-Christmann-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Christmann 2002</LINK>). Initially, there was a significant decrease in the blood flow to the mesenteric artery and the renal artery in the bolus group. This effect gradually disappeared by 12 hours. Changes in urine output were reported by one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Christmann-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Christmann 2002</LINK>); however, there was no documented oliguria. Changes in BUN and creatinine levels were reported by both trials (<LINK REF="STD-Christmann-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Christmann 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hammerman-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Hammerman 1995</LINK>). However, there was no value above the predefined abnormal levels for both BUN and creatinine. Based on these results originating mostly from a single study, it would be difficult to reach a generalizable conclusion regarding the clinical consequences of reductions in mesenteric and renal blood flow. The well-known adverse effect of a decrease in blood flow to the mesenteric and renal circulations following indomethacin injection has always been a concern. This flow reduction may potentially be associated with deterioration in renal function, as evidenced by decreased urine output and increased BUN and creatinine as well as isolated intestinal perforation and NEC. However, none of these adverse effects were found in either of the studies included in this review and evidence does not favor either therapy in this regard.</P>
<P>There are several studies that have compared the effects of different indomethacin administration regimens on decreasing blood flow in preterm infants. Simko et al studied bolus and 30 minute infusion rates. Interestingly, both 30-minute and bolus infusion groups had significantly decreased cerebral flow velocities, although the bolus infusion group dropped more rapidly and fell to lower levels (<LINK REF="REF-Simko-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Simko 1994</LINK>). Edwards et al compared the effects of rapid (30 seconds) versus slow (20 to 30 minutes) infusions of indomethacin on cerebral flow by near-infrared spectroscopy (<LINK REF="REF-Edwards-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Edwards 1990</LINK>). They found an equal cerebral blood flow decrease in both groups. Colditz et al compared the effects of a slow infusion of 20 minutes with a five minute rapid infusion of indomethacin (<LINK REF="REF-Colditz-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Colditz 1989</LINK>). They showed a significant reduction in the cerebral blood flow velocity with the rapid infusion, which was absent in the slow infusion group. Lastly, Austin et al studied the effects of a 30-minute indomethacin infusion on cerebral hemodynamics (<LINK REF="REF-Austin-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Austin 1992</LINK>). They had no rapid infusion group as control, but noted that the slow infusion was associated with a significant decrease in the cerebral flow (<LINK REF="REF-Austin-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Austin 1992</LINK>). In summary, it appears that slowing the infusion to a period of 20 to 30 minutes produces some improvement in the indomethacin-associated reduction of the cerebral blood flow; however, it does not completely eliminate it. Slowing the infusion rate further down to 36-hours, such as discussed in the studies of this review, might be an option to prevent such cerebral hemodynamic fluctuations. However, the clinical consequences of these flow fluctuations are unknown. The use of continuous infusion of indomethacin might also present some disadvantages in care of the preterm infant such as the need for an intravenous site for 36 hours and the requirement of a larger amount of fluid in order to provide lower concentration of indomethacin.<BR/>
<BR/>The aim of treatment with indomethacin is to close a PDA. The two small trials included in this review did not yield sufficient evidence to recommend a protocol change in the treatment of PDA favoring the use of continuous infusion of indomethacin over bolus infusion. A recent retrospective case-control study by de Vries et al reported that continuous infusion might be less effective in closing a PDA than bolus infusions due to low plasma levels for ductal closure, especially in infants &lt; 1000 g and/or precipitation of indomethacin in solutions prepared with glucose (<LINK REF="REF-de-Vries-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">de Vries 2005</LINK>). It is apparent that further studies are needed to investigate the efficacy of a continuous indomethacin regime as well as clinical outcomes associated with blood flow reduction in cerebral, mesenteric and renal circulations. These studies should also include long-term neurodevelopmental follow-up of at least 18 months corrected age in order to clarify the consequences of the adverse effects related to indomethacin.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>Considering the paucity of events in these two eligible trials, the available data was found to be insufficient to draw conclusions regarding the efficacy of continuous indomethacin versus bolus administration for the treatment of PDA. The adverse affect of indomethacin on blood flow in cerebral, mesenteric and renal circulations seems to be reduced by continuous infusion. However, there is a lack of data on the clinical significance of this adverse effect and its amelioration by any method of administration. Considering the small sample size of these two studies, data seems insufficient to reach a conclusion about the preferred methods of indomethacin administration in favor of continuous versus bolus infusions. </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>There is a lack of controlled trials on administration methods and potential complications of indomethacin use. The reviews comparing prolonged vs. short courses and continuous versus bolus infusions have failed to yield conclusions due to the small number of subjects recruited in these trials. Additional trials will be needed to establish comparable therapeutic efficacy of continuous infusion of indomethacin treatment. Clinical implications of indomethacin-associated reduction of cerebral, mesenteric and renal blood flow in preterm infants should be further investigated. These trials should investigate not only short-term outcomes such as reduction of cerebral, mesenteric and renal blood flow and mortality but also long-term outcomes such as ROP, BPD and neurodevelopmental outcome. </P>
