<P>Basal cell carcinoma is the most common human cancer. It is usually caused by excessive exposure to ultraviolet light. Although not life threatening, basal cell carcinoma can destroy the skin and neighbouring tissues, causing significant cosmetic disfigurement, especially on the face. Treatments include surgical removal, radiotherapy, cryotherapy (freezing), phototherapy (light therapy) and creams. Surgery and radiotherapy appear to be the most effective treatments for basal cell carcinoma and Mohs' micrographic surgery (the removal of the tumour layer by layer until it has gone, as determined histologically) the most effective for high risk facial basal cell carcinoma. Photodynamic therapy appears to be useful in the short-term, especially for people who wish to avoid scarring. However, long-term follow-up is needed. Cryotherapy, while convenient and less expensive, does not have a higher cure rate. Early results for imiquimod cream are promising for superficial basal cell carcinoma, and results from an ongoing study are awaited.<BR/>

<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is the commonest skin cancer. BCCs are slow-growing, locally invasive, epidermal skin tumours which mainly affect white skinned people. The first line treatment is usually surgical excision, but numerous alternatives are available.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To assess the effects of treatments for basal cell carcinoma.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>We searched the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register (January 2006), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (<I>The Cochrane LIbrary </I>Issue 1, 2006), the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews <I>(The Cochrane L</I>
<I>i</I>
<I>brary </I>Issue<I> </I>1, 2006), MEDLINE (2004 to January 2006), EMBASE (2005 to January 2006), the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (February 2006). Cited references of all trials identified and key review articles were searched. Pharmaceutical companies were contacted where appropriate for reviews or unpublished trials.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Inclusion criteria were adults with one or more histologically proven, primary basal cell carcinoma. The primary outcome measure was recurrence at three to five years, measured clinically. The secondary outcome included early treatment failure within six months, measured histologically. Adverse treatment effects included aesthetic appearance and pain during and after treatment.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2008-05-22 18:14:31 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Cathy Bennett">
<P>Two authors independently carried out study selection and assessment of methodological quality.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2008-05-23 11:37:30 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Diane A  Horsley">
<P>Twenty seven studies were identified. Only one RCT of surgery versus radiotherapy had primary outcome data at four years, showing significantly more persistent tumours and recurrences in the radiotherapy group as compared to the surgery group, (RR 0.09, 95%CI 0.01 to 0.69). One study found no significant difference for recurrence at 30 months when Moh's micrographic surgery was compared to surgery for high risk facial BCCs, (RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.16 to 2.64). One study of methyl aminolevulinate photodynamic therapy (MAL PDT) versus cryotherapy found no significant difference in recurrences in the MAL PDT group when compared to cryotherapy at one year (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.22 to 1.12)<I>.</I> Cryotherapy showed no significant difference in recurrences at one year when compared to surgery on one small study<B>. </B>When radiotherapy was compared to cryotherapy there were significantly fewer recurrences at one year in the radiotherapy group compared to the cryotherapy group.</P>
<P>Short-term studies suggest a success rate of 87 to 88% for imiquimod in the treatment of superficial BCC using a once-daily regimen for 6 weeks and a 76% treatment response when treating nodular BCC for 12 weeks, when measured histologically.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2008-05-23 10:56:27 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Diane A  Horsley">
<P>Overall there has been very little good quality research on treatments for BCC. Most trials have only evaluated BCCs in low risk locations. Surgery and radiotherapy appear to be the most effective treatments with surgery showing the lowest failure rates. Although cosmetic outcomes appear good with PDT, long-term follow-up data are needed. Other treatments might have some use but few have been compared to surgery. An ongoing study comparing imiquimod to surgery should clarify whether imiquimod is a useful option.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Disease definition</HEADING>
<P>Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is the most common cancer found in humans (<LINK REF="REF-Miller-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Miller 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Preston-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Preston 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Telfer-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Telfer 1999</LINK>). BCC is a slow-growing, locally invasive, malignant (but not life threatening), epidermal skin tumour which mainly affects white skinned people (<LINK REF="REF-Telfer-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Telfer 1999</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Clinical features</HEADING>
<P>Clinical appearances and morphology are diverse, including nodular, cystic, rodent ulcer (where the lesion may break down, ulcerate in the centre, and bleed forming a crust), superficial, morphoeic (scarring), keratotic and pigmented variants. Early BCC may appear as a small red patch or a scab that fails to heal. Symptoms such as pain are rare. Nodular BCC is the most common type in the UK. In other countries such as Australia, superficial BCC is also very common (<LINK REF="REF-Staples-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Staples 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Raasch-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Raasch 2002</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Natural history</HEADING>
<P>BCCs are usually slow growing tumours that only rarely spread to other distant parts of the body (<LINK REF="REF-Lo-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lo 1991</LINK>). Growth of BCC is usually localised to the area of origin; however some BCCs tend to infiltrate tissues in a three-dimensional fashion through the irregular growth of finger-like projections which may not be obvious on visual inspection (<LINK REF="REF-Breuninger-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Breuninger 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Miller-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Miller 1991</LINK>). If left untreated, or inadequately treated, the BCC can cause extensive tissue destruction, particularly on the face. It may even infiltrate bone and deeper structures like the brain. The clinical course of BCC is unpredictable; it may remain small for years with little tendency to grow, or it may grow rapidly or proceed by successive spurts of extension of tumour and partial regression (<LINK REF="REF-Franchimont-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Franchimont 1982</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Epidemiology and causes</HEADING>
<P>Considerable variation exists in the literature for incidence rates of basal cell carcinoma. Latitude and sun exposure contribute to much of this variation. In Australia, the incidence rate was 788 for every 100,000 people annually in 1995 (<LINK REF="REF-Staples-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Staples 1998</LINK>). In the USA the incidence rate was 146 for every 100,000 annually (<LINK REF="REF-Chuang-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chuang 1990</LINK>). In Western Europe, the incidence from a Dutch study was 200 per 100,000 annually (<LINK REF="REF-Thissen-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thissen 1998</LINK>). Figures from the UK are much lower at around 100 cases per 100,000 population annually (<LINK REF="REF-Census-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Census 1988</LINK> ). Some of these estimates may be low due to incomplete registration of these tumours.</P>
<P>Eighty-five percent of all BCCs appear on the head and neck region (<LINK REF="REF-Roenigk-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roenigk 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McCormack-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">McCormack 1997</LINK>). The tumour may occur at any age, but the incidence of BCC increases markedly after the age of 40. The incidence in younger people is increasing, possibly as a result of increased sun exposure. Risk factors include fair skin, tendency to freckle (<LINK REF="REF-Gilbody-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gilbody 1994</LINK>), degree of sun exposure (<LINK REF="REF-Zaynoun-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zaynoun 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pearl-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pearl 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mackie-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mackie 1987</LINK>), excessive sun bed use, radiotherapy, phototherapy, male gender and a genetic predisposition (<LINK REF="REF-Schreiber-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schreiber 1990</LINK>). Naevoid BCC syndrome (Gorlin syndrome) is an autosomal (non-sex determining chromosome) dominantly inherited condition characterised by developmental abnormalities and the occurrence of multiple BCCs. Mutations in people with naevoid BCC syndrome have been found on the patched gene located on chromosome nine, which appears to be crucial for proper embryonic development and for tumour suppression (<LINK REF="REF-Johnson-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnson 1996</LINK>).</P>

<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2008-05-22 14:08:37 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Cathy Bennett">
<P>The first line treatment of BCC is often surgical excision. Numerous alternatives are available and include: curettage, cryosurgery (delivered by a variety of methods), laser, surgical excision with predetermined margins of clinically normal tissue, excision under frozen section control, Moh's micrographic surgery (the removal of the tumour layer by layer until it has gone as determined histologically), radiotherapy, intralesional therapy, photodynamic therapy (the application of a cream to induce photo damage to the tumour using varying light sources), immunomodulators (agents used to stimulate the immune system to eradicate the tumour) and chemotherapy. Surgical treatment may be expensive as it often requires access to a minor operating theatre.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2008-05-22 14:08:41 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Cathy Bennett">
<P>Although there are wide varieties of treatment modalities used in the management of BCC, and the vast majority of the tumours are successfully treated, little research is available which accurately compares these different treatment modalities.</P>
<P>The British Government White paper (<LINK REF="REF-Government-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Government 1997</LINK>) on the British National Health Service states that by the year 2000 people with any suspected squamous cell carcinoma or malignant melanoma are expected to be seen by a specialist within two weeks. Referral guidelines suggest that raised, growing and ulcerated lesions should be referred - a description that also refers to BCCs. With an increase in incidence of skin cancer it is therefore important to have a pragmatic and reliable treatment for BCC that is acceptable to the person affected, giving as little distress as possible in terms of pain, number of hospital visits and scarring. From a health provider's perspective, it is important to balance efficacy against cost.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">1. Surgical excision</HEADING>
<P>Two trials were found where surgical excision was the chosen therapeutic option (<LINK REF="STD-Avril-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Avril 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Smeets-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Smeets 2004</LINK>). See also PDT option for another trial using surgery (<LINK REF="STD-Rhodes-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Rhodes 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>One trial (<LINK REF="STD-Avril-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Avril 1997</LINK>) of 347 participants compared surgical excision with frozen section margin control versus radiotherapy in primary basal cell carcinoma of the face, involving tumours less than 40 mm diameter. BCCs included nodular, ulcerated, superficial and pagetoid and sclerosing. The main outcome measure was histologically confirmed persistent tumour or recurrent disease at four years. The secondary end point was the cosmetic results assessed by the participant, the dermatologist and three people not involved in the trial.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">a) Efficacy</HEADING>
<P>At four years there were significantly fewer persistent tumours and recurrences, measured histologically in the surgery group as compared to the radiotherapy group, (RR 0.09, 95%CI, 0.01 to 0.69; <LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>); we have included the treatment failures in with the recurrences for the radiotherapy group. It should also be noted here that a number of different radiotherapy techniques were used as chosen by the radiotherapist.</P>
<P>Cosmetic outcome as assessed by five observers over the four years of study consistently favoured surgery (<LINK REF="REF-Petit-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Petit 2000</LINK>). At 4 years the participants assessed their cosmetic results as good in 87% of cases after surgery and in 69% after radiotherapy.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">b) Potential drawbacks</HEADING>
<P>After radiotherapy dyspigmentations and telangiectasia (which may affect the aesthetic appearance) developed in more than 65% of the participants 4 years. Radiodystrophy affected 41% of the participants at 4 years. Several previous studies have reported cure rates and cosmetic results with surgery and radiotherapy; however, the above study was the first randomised trial giving an unbiased comparison of the two treatments.<BR/>
<BR/>A second new trial (<LINK REF="STD-Smeets-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Smeets 2004</LINK>) of 374 participants (408 primary lesions) and 204 participants (191 recurrent lesions) compared Moh's micrographic surgery (MMS) versus surgery with a 3 mm margin. If the defect margins were found to be positive, a re-excision with a 3 mm margin was done. If the margins remained positive after a second excision then MMS was undertaken. The primary outcome was recurrence of carcinoma.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">a) Efficacy</HEADING>
<P>Only the results for the 374 trial participants with primary lesions are discussed in this review. Number of recurrences measured clinically at 30 months did not differ significantly between the groups (RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.16 to 2.64; <LINK REF="CMP-002.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.1</LINK>). It should be noted that some participants had more than one lesion. Overall aesthetic outcome did not differ significantly however cosmetic results became significantly poorer with increasing defect size for primary BCCs (r=0.383, p&lt;0.001, these results being taken from the published report).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">b) Potential drawbacks</HEADING>
<P>Thirty one (18%) primary BCCs were incompletely excised on first excision in the surgical excision (SE) group. Primary tumours with aggressive histopathology were significantly more likely to be incompletely excised than those of the non aggressive type.</P>

<P>Please see the two RCTs described under surgical excision and cryotherapy (<LINK REF="STD-Avril-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Avril 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hall-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Hall 1986</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">3. Cryotherapy</HEADING>
<P>Please see also PDT option for another two studies using cryotherapy (<LINK REF="STD-Wang-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Basset_x002d_Sequin-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Basset-Sequin 2005</LINK>). Four RCTs were identified including one new study in abstract form. One study of 93 participants (<LINK REF="STD-Hall-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Hall 1986</LINK>) compared radiotherapy with cryotherapy using a spray gun with 2 freeze thaw cycles for primary basal cell carcinoma excluding lesions on the nose and ears (pinna). The paper gave no indication of the type of lesion. The aims of the study were to compare the control of the tumours with the two treatments, to assess the final cosmetic result and to compare the discomfort and inconvenience experienced by the participant.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">a) Efficacy</HEADING>
<P>No data were available for recurrence at three to five years or early treatment failure within six months. There were however significantly fewer recurrences at one year in the radiotherapy group compared to the cryotherapy group RR 0.11(95% CI 0.03 to 0.43; <LINK REF="CMP-003.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.1</LINK>). These data should be interpreted with caution as nearly two-thirds of all recurrent tumours appear in the first three years after treatment. The cosmetic results for the two modes of treatment were not significantly different.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">b) Potential drawbacks</HEADING>
<P>The degree of pain, discomfort, discharge and bleeding from the treated areas was the same in both groups. Only one participant from each group was seriously inconvenienced by their treatment. Hypopigmentation was more common than hyperpigmentation with both modes of treatment (81% of those in the radiotherapy group and 88% of those in the cryotherapy group). Seven participants treated with radiotherapy developed some radiation telangiectasia. Hypopigmentation and telangiectasia tend to be lifelong. Five participants treated with cryotherapy developed milia - these all disappeared at one year.</P>
<P>A second study of 96 participants (<LINK REF="STD-Thissen-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Thissen 2000</LINK>) compared cryosurgery (using a cone spray technique and a double freeze/thaw cycle) with surgical excision for superficial and nodular BCCs of the head and neck that were clinically smaller than 2 cm in diameter. The primary outcome was cosmetic result, however recurrence rates in both groups were also compared. Clinically assessed recurrences were treated by surgical excision, and cosmetic results were judged by five independent professional observers and by the participants.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">a) Efficacy</HEADING>
<P>No data were available for recurrence at three to five year or early treatment failure within six months.</P>
<P>There were no significant differences in recurrences at 1 year, measured clinically, between the 2 groups RR 7.0 in favour of sugery, but with very large 95% CI of 0.37 to 131.96 (<LINK REF="CMP-004.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.1</LINK>). Cosmetic results after surgical excision were generally significantly better on evaluation as compared to cryosurgery for superficial and nodular subtypes localised in the head/neck region.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">b) Potential drawbacks</HEADING>
<P>Two participants (4%) developed secondary wound infections in the first and second week after surgery for which systemic antibiotics were given. Ninety percent of participants in the cryotherapy group complained of moderate-to-severe swelling of the treated area, followed by long-lasting leakage of exudate from the defect. Three participants (6%) had secondary wound infection after cryotherapy, for which systemic antibiotics were given.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">4. Photodynamic therapy (PDT)</HEADING>
<P>Seven trials were identified - six new trials of which four are in abstract form.</P>
<P>The first new study in 103 participants (118 lesions) compared photodynamic therapy (MAL PDT) with surgical excision for nodular BCC of the face (<LINK REF="STD-Rhodes-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Rhodes 2004</LINK>). Primary outcome was clinically assessed lesion clearance at 3 months and secondary outcome was sustained response at 12 months and cosmetic outcome at 3 and 12 months. Cosmesis and lesion recurrence was further assessed at 24 months.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">a) Efficacy</HEADING>
<P>It should be noted that results in the trial were given for lesion clearance and some participants had more than one lesion. There was no significant difference in early treatment failure at 3 months, measured clinically, RR 4.91(95% CI 0.59 to 40.57; <LINK REF="CMP-005.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 5.1</LINK>) and there was a trend for increased number of recurrences in the MAL PDT group as compared to the surgical excision group at 12 months RR of recurrences in the PDT group of 4.42 (95% CI 1.0 to19.47; <LINK REF="CMP-005.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 5.2</LINK>). Cosmetic outcome was significantly better at 12 and 24 months on participant assessment and at three, 12 and 24 months on investigator evaluation, p&lt;0.001.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">b) Potential drawbacks</HEADING>
<P>Significantly more participants treated with MAL PDT compared to surgery reported adverse events 52% versus 29%, (p=0.03). Most of the adverse events were transient local reactions commonly associated with PDT, such as burning sensation of the skin, pain in the skin or erythema.</P>
<P>The second trial (n=88) photodynamic therapy was compared with 2-freeze thaw cycle cryotherapy for superficial and nodular BCCs on the head, neck, legs and arms that were suitable for PDT and cryotherapy (<LINK REF="STD-Wang-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2001</LINK>) .</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">a) Efficacy</HEADING>
<P>No data were available for early treatment failure within six months.</P>
<P>There were no significant differences in recurrence rates at 1 year, measured histologically (RR 1.63, 95% CI 0.66 to 3.98; <LINK REF="CMP-006.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 6.1</LINK>) or clinically (RR 0.35 in favour of PDT, 95% CI 0.07 to 1.73; <LINK REF="CMP-006.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 6.2</LINK>). Scarring and tissue defects scored significantly better following PDT.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">b) Potential drawbacks</HEADING>
<P>More participants indicated pain and discomfort during and after treatment with PDT than with cryotherapy but the differences were not statistically significant.</P>
<P>The third RCT (n=83) compared the clinical and cosmetic outcome of superficial BCCs (clinical thickness less than 1 mm, diameter less than 3 cm), using either laser or broad band halogen light, in photodynamic therapy with topical 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) (<LINK REF="STD-Soler-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Soler 2000</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">a) Efficacy</HEADING>
<P>Although 83 participants were randomised, 245 superficial BCC's were included in the analysis, indicating more than one lesion per participant. There were no significant difference in early treatment failure measured clinically, or cosmetic score at 6 months, when the 2 different light sources were compared (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.45 to1.44; <LINK REF="CMP-007.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 7.1</LINK>) and (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.01; <LINK REF="CMP-007.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 7.2</LINK>). It should be noted that the analysis was by lesion and therefore the data has not been pooled.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">b) Potential drawbacks</HEADING>
<P>Some discomfort during and after illumination was reported by 83% of participants receiving laser light and 76% of those receiving broadband halogen light PDT. Sixty-eight percent of the participants who received laser light and 74% of participants who received broadband halogen light reported some degree of discomfort (stinging, itching, pain, headache, sensation of warmth or blushing) during the first week after treatment. No serious adverse events were reported during the six-month follow-up.</P>
<P>Two smaller new studies with short follow-up (abstract form only) compared MAL PDT to placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Tope-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Tope 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Foley-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Foley 2003</LINK>). Both studies found cosmetic outcome better for MAL PDT.</P>
<P>A sixth new study in abstract form only in 118 participants (<LINK REF="STD-Basset_x002d_Sequin-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Basset-Sequin 2005</LINK>) compared MAL PDT to cryotherapy for superficial BCC. Fewer recurrences were noted in the MAL PDT group when compared to cryotherapy at one year, but this was not significant (RR 0.5, 95% CI 0.22 to 1.12, P=0.09; <LINK REF="CMP-008.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 8.1</LINK>). At 36 months the estimated complete response rate was 74% for both groups and cosmetic outcome was substantially better for MAL PDT (89%) than cryotherapy (63%) as reported in the paper.</P>
<P>A seventh new study (<LINK REF="STD-Lui-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Lui 2004</LINK>) compared verteporfin with three different light doses: 60,120 or 180 J/cm in 54 participants with 421 multiple BCCs including squamous cell carcinoma in situ (Bowen disease).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">a) Efficacy</HEADING>
<P>There was a dose-response for histological clearance six months after treatment. For nBCC this ranged from 76% to 100% and for superficial BCC this ranged from 63 to 97%.</P>
<P>The best cosmetic outcome was obtained for tumours treated with 60J/cm and the cosmetic outcome of the tumours in the 180J/cm<SUP>2</SUP> improved markedly over time (no separate results for BCC alone).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">b) Potential drawbacks</HEADING>
<P>Adverse events (pain pruritus, burning, oedema, prickling, erythema, skin hypertrophy, exudates, hyperesthesia and stinging) were experienced by 89% of the participants. No major systemic adverse events reported.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Comments</HEADING>
<P>Analysis was per protocol. Six participants treated with a light dose of 60J/cm received a second treatment. Fifteen participants had nevoid BCC syndrome.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">5. Intralesional interferon therapy</HEADING>
<P>Four trials were found.</P>
<P>In the first trial (<LINK REF="STD-Cornell-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Cornell 1990</LINK>) of 165 participants with either nodular of superficial BCCs on the head, neck, face, trunk and extremities, compared interferon alpha-2b, 1.5 million units 3 times weekly for 3 weeks with vehicle in a 3:1 ratio of interferon-treated to placebo-treated participants. The mean lesion area was 83 mm square in the treatment group and 75 mm square in the placebo group.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">a) Efficacy</HEADING>
<P>There were significantly fewer early treatment failures in the interferon group as compared to placebo, RR 0.02 (95% CI 0.12 to 0.32; <LINK REF="CMP-009.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 9.1</LINK>). There was also a significant difference in recurrence rates at 52 weeks indicating a better response for the treatment group as compared to the vehicle group. The cure rate was independent of the lesion type or size. After 1 year 83% of participants and 61% of physicians rated the cosmetic appearance as excellent for participants treated with interferon.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">b) Potential drawbacks</HEADING>
<P>Flu-like symptoms occurred more commonly in the interferon-treated group than the vehicle group.</P>
<P>In the second trial (n=35) of recombinant interferon beta 1 million units was given 3 times weekly for 3 weeks and compared to placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Rogozinski-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Rogozinski 1997</LINK>). Size and location of BCC not given.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">a) Efficacy</HEADING>
<P>There were significantly fewer early treatment failures in the interferon group compared to the placebo group, (RR 0.53, 95% CI, 0.33 to 0.86; <LINK REF="CMP-010.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 10.1</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">b) Potential drawbacks</HEADING>
<P>Inflammation at the injection site was found in 11 out of 16 participants in the treatment group and 4 out of 18 receiving placebo.</P>
<P>In the third trial (<LINK REF="STD-Alpsoy-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Alpsoy 1996</LINK>) 45 participants were randomised to receive 15 or 30 million units of either interferon alpha-2a, 2b or both 2a and 2b. The aim of the study was to evaluate the effectiveness of the IFN alpha-2a and 2b, and whether this effect may be increased by their combination. Types of BCC included superficial, nodular and morphoeic located on the head and trunk. Lesion size ranged from 0.5 to 8.9 cm<SUP>2</SUP>.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">a) Efficacy</HEADING>
<P>Increased effectiveness was not shown with combination therapy. For IFN alpha-2a there was a 33.3% early treatment failure, for IFN alpha-2b there was a 33.3% early treatment failure and for IFN alpha-2a + 2b there was a 26.6% early treatment failure (figures taken from the paper). There was no significant difference in early treatment failure when comparing IFN alpha-2a and 2b and 2a, RR 0.8 (95% CI 0.27 to 2.41; <LINK REF="CMP-011.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 11.1</LINK>); 2a + 2b and 2b, RR 0.8 (95%CI 0.27 to 2.41; <LINK REF="CMP-012.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 12.1</LINK>) or when comparing 2a to 2b RR 1 (95% CI 0.36 to 2.75; <LINK REF="CMP-013.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 13.1</LINK>). Although superficial, nodular and morphealike BCCs were included, the majority of participants had nodular BCCs.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">b) Potential drawbacks</HEADING>
<P>Pain was experienced at the injection site and all participants had flu-like symptoms (fever, chills, headaches, fatigue, myalgia) especially within the first two weeks after the initiation of therapy.</P>
<P>In a fourth trial (<LINK REF="STD-Edwards-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Edwards 1990</LINK>) of 65 participants, a single dose of 10 million IU protamine zinc chelate interferon alpha-2b (a sustained-release preparation) was compared with the same dose weekly for 3 weeks. Only lesions ranging in size from 0.5 to 1.5 cm for nodular BCCs or 2 cm for superficial BCCs (largest diameter) were included. Location of BCC was not given.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">a) Efficacy</HEADING>
<P>There were significantly fewer early treatment failures in favour of three times weekly injection as compared to a single dose, RR 0.41 (95% CI 0.19 to 0.92; <LINK REF="CMP-014.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 14.1</LINK>). Participants who experienced eradication of their tumour graded their cosmetic outcome as excellent in 51%, very good 22%, good 14%, satisfactory 10% and poor 3% (taken from published report).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">b) Potential drawbacks</HEADING>
<P>All participants experienced at least one adverse reaction. Side effects were similar for both single and repeated dosage groups, and were those common to interferon. Adverse reactions occurring in at least 20% of participants were fever, rigors, myalgia, headache and nausea. Other side effects included arthralgia, malaise, fatigue, diarrhoea, paresthesia, somnolence, thirst, dizziness, vomiting, rashes, and anorexia. Adverse reactions began on the day of treatment and generally lasted five to eight hours, except for headaches which lasted about one day.</P>

<P>BEC-5 is a mixture of solasodine glycosides found in solanaceous plants e.g. aubergine. </P>
<P>One RCT was identified which compared BEC-5 cream to matching vehicle (<LINK REF="STD-Punjabi-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Punjabi 2000</LINK>). Biopsy proven lesions, excluding morphoeic BCCs, were treated twice daily under occlusion with BEC-5 or vehicle for eight weeks. Size and location of BCC not given.</P>

<P>Two trials were identified.</P>
<P>The first trial (<LINK REF="STD-Romagosa-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Romagosa 2000</LINK>) compared 5-fluorouracil cream 5% in phosphatidyl choline (PC) vehicle with 5-fluorouracil 5% in petrolatum for non superficial BCCs, which measured at least 0.7 cm in greatest diameter. PC was used as a vehicle to facilitate the penetration of 5-FU. Facial BCCs were excluded.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">a) Efficacy</HEADING>
<P>There was no significant difference in early treatment failure at 16 weeks, RR 0.23, 95% CI 0.03 to 1.81; <LINK REF="CMP-016.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 16.1</LINK>). It should however be noted that 13 participants were involved with 17 biopsy-proven BCCs randomised, indicating more than 1 lesion per participant. Care should be taken when interpreting these results since in the absence of a suitable analysis that takes into account the number of participants, these results could over-estimate any difference.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">b) Potential drawbacks</HEADING>
<P>Local irritation, erythema, ulceration and tenderness were common reactions but were reported to be well tolerated by the participants. Minimal itching and discomfort were experienced by some of the participants in both treatment arms.</P>
<P>The second open-label randomised study of 122 participants (<LINK REF="STD-Miller-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 1997</LINK>) tested the safety, tolerance, and efficacy of 6 treatment regimens of 5-fluorouracil/epinephrine gel (5-FU/epi gel). Two doses and four treatment schedules were used. BCCs were superficial and nodular, located on the head, upper extremities and lower extremities with median lesion areas of 80 mm square.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">a) Efficacy</HEADING>
<P>All regimens appeared to work well and there were no statistically significant differences among them. However the wide confidence intervals indicate that large differences between regimens cannot be ruled out. Overall the 6 regimens had an average early treatment failure of 9% on the basis of histological analysis of excised specimen at 3 months after treatment. For participants who received 0.5 ml 5-FU/epi gel twice weekly for 2 weeks resulted in no early treatment failure. There was an 8% early treatment failures for superficial lesions and a 9% early treatment failure for nodular (taken from text).</P>
<P>There were no significant differences in early treatment failure for any of the following comparisons: 0.1 ml 5-FU/epi gel vs 0.5 ml 5-FU/epi gel (both once a week for 6 weeks), RR 2.10 (95% CI 0.21 to 21.39; <LINK REF="CMP-017.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 17.1</LINK>); 1 ml 5-FU/epi gel vs 0.5 ml 5-FU/epi gel (both twice a week for 3 weeks), RR 0.26 (95% CI 0.03 to 2.14; <LINK REF="CMP-018.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 18.1</LINK>); 0.5 ml 5-FU/epi gel twice a week for 4 weeks vs 0.5 ml 5-FU/epi gel 3 times a week for 2 weeks, RR 4.09 (95% CI 0.21 to 79.88; <LINK REF="CMP-019.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 19.1</LINK>).</P>

<P>A total of nine trials were found of which eight were sponsored by the manufacturer.</P>
<P>One trial (<LINK REF="STD-Beutner-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Beutner 1999</LINK>) evaluated the safety and efficacy of imiquimod 5% cream in the treatment of superficial and nodular BCCs located mainly on the upper body ranging in size from 0.5 to 2 cm. In this population of 35 participants with BCC, 24 received imiquimod 5% cream and 11 received vehicle cream in 1 of 5 dosing regimens for up to 16 weeks.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">a) Efficacy</HEADING>
<P>When treatment failures from the different doses were combined and compared to the vehicle there was a significant reduction in early treatment failure in the 5% imiquimod group as compared to the vehicle group, RR 0.18 (95% CI 0.07 to 0.46; <LINK REF="CMP-020.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 20.1</LINK>). This small trial suggested success rates similar to those of excision surgery.</P>
<P>Another similar trial of 128 participants (<LINK REF="STD-Geisse-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Geisse 2002</LINK>) compared imiquimod twice daily, once daily, 5 days per week or 3 days per week versus vehicle for superficial BCCs (sBCCs).

<P>Histological clearance (defined as participants with no histological evidence of BCC when the site of the treated lesion was excised 6 weeks after imiquimod treatment) rates were 100% (3/3), 88% (29/33), 73% (22/30) and 70% (23/33) for twice daily, once daily, 6 times weekly and 3 times weekly regimens respectively, equating to early treatment failure of 0% (0/3), 12% (4/33), 27% (8/30) and 30% (10/33) respectively - taken from the paper. When higher and lower doses were compared there was a trend for higher doses of 5% imiquimod having fewer treatment failures as compared to lower doses of 5% imiquimod, RR 0.39 (95% CI 0.14 to 1.06; <LINK REF="CMP-022.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 22.1</LINK>).<BR/>
<BR/>In a pooled analysis of the five studies comparing high and low dose imiquimod 5% there was a 50% reduction in the risk of early treatment failure in the high dose as compared to the low dose, (RR 0.51, 95% CI 0.35, 0.75; <LINK REF="CMP-022.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 22.1</LINK>).</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">1. Surgical excision</HEADING>
<P>The Avril trial was the only trial to follow-up trial participants for four years. The trial showed that the failure rate was significantly lower in surgery than in radiotherapy for the treatment of BCC of the face for lesions of less than four cm in diameter and that surgery may also be preferred for its cosmetic result. The Smeets trial was the only study to look at high risk BCCs both primary and recurrent (although only the primary BCCs are considered in this review). The study showed lower recurrence rates after MMS than after surgery, yet the differences were not statistically significant. It was suggested by the trial authors that the groups may not have been large enough to detect a significant difference. This study also used three mm margins for both treatments to standardize the two treatment modalities (smaller margins are usually used for MMS). Total operative costs of MMS were higher than those for surgery.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">2. Radiotherapy</HEADING>
<P>Surgery and radiotherapy appear to be the most effective treatments, the best results being obtained with surgery.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">3. Cryotherapy</HEADING>
<P>When cryotherapy was compared to radiotherapy (<LINK REF="STD-Hall-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Hall 1986</LINK>) significantly more recurrences were found at one year, measured histologically, in the cryotherapy group. The cosmetic effect for radiotherapy and cryotherapy are comparable. Although cryotherapy is convenient and less expensive than radiotherapy, overall cryotherapy does not offer a satisfactory alternative to radiotherapy in the treatment of BCC.</P>
<P>Surgical excision for nodular and superficial lesions (<LINK REF="STD-Thissen-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Thissen 2000</LINK>) smaller than two cm is cosmetically more acceptable compared to cryosurgery. Cryotherapy does not appear to be a satisfactory option compared to surgery for superficial or nodular lesions in the head and neck area of less than two cm in diameter.</P>
<P>Facial lesions require a double freeze-thaw cycle with liquid nitrogen if the high cure rates in many reports of formal excision or radiotherapy are to be achieved (<LINK REF="STD-Mallon-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Mallon 1996</LINK>). The spot freeze technique using a liquid nitrogen spray was used in Mallon's study. Although case series suggest that higher clearance rates can be achieved, particularly with low-risk tumours, more prospective controlled evidence is required.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">4. Photodynamic therapy (PDT)</HEADING>
<P>Although participant tolerability was greater and cosmetic outcomes were considered better in the PDT group compared to cryosurgery, current efficacy data does not support the introduction of PDT for the treatment of basal cell carcinomas without further studies (<LINK REF="STD-Wang-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2001</LINK>).<BR/>
<BR/>Topical ALA-based PDT with a broadband halogen light source gives cure rates and cosmetic outcomes similar to those obtained with a laser light source. Reduced costs, increased safety as well as the possibility of general use by dermatologists are other elements in favour of the broadband halogen lamp (<LINK REF="STD-Soler-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Soler 2000</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">5. Intralesional interferon therapy</HEADING>
<P>Combining IFN alpha-2a and 2b does not appear to increase their effectiveness (<LINK REF="STD-Alpsoy-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Alpsoy 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>Interferon is a labour intensive treatment and participants can develop many systemic adverse effects. Together with high percentage of early treatment failure, this is a treatment that is unlikely to be acceptable to many people with BCC or doctors. Interferon alpha 2b does not compare with current standards of surgical or radiotherapy cures and so cannot be recommended (<LINK REF="STD-Cornell-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Cornell 1990</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">6. BEC-5 Cream</HEADING>
<P>Although a modest histological cure rate was shown at eight weeks and at one year, this rate is probably not as sufficiently high as compared to other treatments. It was also not clear from the published abstract as to the proportions of people with nodular and superficial BCC.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">7. Fluorouracil</HEADING>
<P>The Romagosa study may indicate an increase in short-term eradication of BCC using a phosphatidyl choline-based vehicle compared with conventional petrolatum-based formulations of 5-FU. There was excellent cosmetic outcome in all treatment sites before excision at week 16. Further large-scale double-blinded trials with long-term follow-up are needed to establish the efficacy of this treatment modality.</P>
<P>The variable treatment regimens with increased dose and treatment frequency, or treatment frequency resulted in higher tumour complete response rate than that obtained in an earlier pilot study (<LINK REF="REF-Orenberg-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Orenberg 1992</LINK>). It appeared that higher drug concentrations could be maintained longer with 5-FU/epi gel drug delivery and therefore a trial of 5-FU/epi gel versus surgical excision, monitoring adverse effects, is required to confirm the claim that response rates are comparable to surgery.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">8. Imiquimod</HEADING>
<P>For all the trials local skin reaction to the cream could include, redness, oedema, skin hardening, vesicles, erosion, ulceration, flaking and scabbing. Although concealment of allocation for the trials was unclear, analysis was done by intention to treat. One drawback was the fact there was no long-term follow-up for recurrence. The fact that participants are able to apply the cream themselves may be an advantage of imiquimod. The Shumack study suggests that longer treatment times (i.e. 12 weeks as opposed to 6 weeks) are needed to treat nodular tumours. This is probably what might be expected from a treatment that relies on percutaneous penetration. In other words, tumour depth may be an important predictor of treatment response.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">9. Other treatments</HEADING>
<P>We are aware of a large number of case series reports on the different treatment modalities for primary BCCs. These studies cannot be included in our review. However they have been reviewed elsewhere (<LINK REF="REF-Thissen-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thissen 1999</LINK>) - where the trial authors found that recurrence rates could not be compared due to lack of uniformity in methods of reporting and were unable to propose general guidelines for the treatment of BCC.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2008-05-23 10:56:00 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Diane A  Horsley">
<P>Despite the enormous volume of work involved in the treatment of BCC around the world, there has been very little good quality research on the efficacy of the treatment modalities used. Only one study has looked at high risk facial BCCs. More studies or subgroup analyses are required for morphoeic tumours.</P>
<P>Surgery and radiotherapy appear to be the most effective treatments, the best results being obtained with surgery. Cosmetic effect is better for surgery than for radiotherapy. Cosmetic outcome for PDT was significantly better than surgery. However, there were also comparatively high failure rates associated with PDT when compared to surgery, radiotherapy and cryotherapy. PDT requires a number of hospital visits and this may not suit all people with BCC. There is a need for a long-term follow-up looking at the effectiveness of PDT. The majority of studies have been performed on low-risk BCCs, the results of which are probably not applicable to tumours of the morphoeic type.</P>
<P>Broadband halogen light source may give cure rates and cosmetic outcome similar to laser light photodynamic therapy (PDT) with possible benefits of reduced cost, increased safety and ease of use.</P>
<P>Cryotherapy, although convenient and less expensive than surgery or radiotherapy, does not have better cure rates than surgery or radiotherapy (especially for lesions greater than two cm) although it is difficult to make generalisations given the many different ways of delivering cryotherapy, some of which may be suboptimal.<BR/>
<BR/>The efficacy of interferon alpha has not been directly compared with standard surgical treatment; interferons are associated with significant side-effects, and require several clinic visits which may overshadow its usefulness, especially in the elderly.</P>
<P>There is insufficient evidence to make recommendations on BEC-5 cream at present.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2008-05-23 11:23:32 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Diane A  Horsley">
<P>Preliminary studies suggest a useful success rate (87 to 88%) for imiquimod in the treatment of superficial BCC using a once-daily regimen for 6 weeks and a modest (76%) treatment response when treating nodular BCC for 12 weeks. These results need to be confirmed by an ongoing five year study of imiquimod versus surgery. There is a need for trials evaluating against excisional surgery with long-term (at least three years) follow-up data. Further studies for all of the interferon treatments and PDT are needed before they can be recommended.</P>
<P>Eradication of BCC using 5-FU in phosphatidyl choline based vehicle to increase penetration should be compared with surgery, with long-term follow-up. Future trials should make it very clear which type of BCCs are being studied (size, location and histological subtypes). Morphoeic BCC and recurrent tumours should be considered separately. Follow-up should be for a minimum of three years, and assessment of adverse effects should include pain, cosmetic appearance and costs.</P>
