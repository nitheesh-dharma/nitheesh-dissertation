The abstract was correct and I have amended the results to match this.&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Search: Liz S notes 3/6/2015&lt;/b&gt; - I've updated the search methods section and moved table 1 to appendix 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Search date is July 2014, so I will re-run search and send to Phillipa. if there are no new studies, dates can be simply updated. If there are new studies, they can be included, but if not, they can go into awaiting assessment and flagged for next update. In this scenario, search date remains as July 2014, with a note in text to say a search update was run, new studies found but not incorporated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PP comments: lets flag for next update NOTE to SELF!! &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Becky N notes (contact editor) 02/06/15:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, I this is a really well written review update and I enjoyed reading it; the strengths and limitation of the evidence for mucolytics in COPD/chronic bronchitis and very clearly explained throughout. I have just a few comments below:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PP thank you to you all - you are very thorough, and I am sure the review is so much better now. Thanks for your help with referencing correctly- could someone accept those changes - did not seem to be able to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PP I did notmy &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Very clear. &amp;#8216;Sick days&amp;#8217; not reported in abstract, but as a primary outcome, should be at least mentioned briefly. Adverse events &lt;b&gt;p&lt;/b&gt;erhaps needs expanding slightly? Mentioned, but very briefly&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PP fixed&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Consistency between abstract, conclusions and PLS:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think there is an inconsistency between the abstract and the text of the results: The peto OR for having no exacerbation over the entire study period for treatment with mucolytics in double-blind trials is reported as 1.75; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.57 to 1.94 in the text, but 1.71; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.53 to 1.90 in the abstract. I think the abstract is correct; from the analysis, OR 1.75 appears to relate to all trials (double and single blind). The NNTBs also don&amp;#8217;t match. Please check (I may be wrong!)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PP- Have just made it the total (Db and sb trials included). I am not sure how to work out the CI for the NNTB which is 8- may we ask Chris. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rest of the results appear consistent but just one comment: SGRQ is reported using random effects, whereas the rest of the outcomes are reported using fixed effects. I appreciate you have mentioned in the main text that switching from FE to RE didn&amp;#8217;t make a much difference, but is it worth switching to FEs for consistency through the review? Again &amp;#8211; there may be a good reason why you chose to report REs rather than FEs so please ignore if I&amp;#8217;ve misunderstood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PP I have switched this back&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;PLS:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wonder if we benefit from re-structuring under headings according to the more recent standards? (see Emma W's comment also)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Background: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I wonder if a little more description of the intervention would be helpful to the reader, e.g. clarifying usual route of administration, whether they are usually given long term or acutely etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PP done this I hope&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Methods:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The section describing risk of bias assessment perhaps needs expanding slightly; currently, it reads almost as if trials were &lt;i&gt;only&lt;/i&gt; assessed for risk of selection bias? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PP yes fixed I hope - you can see how your standards have changed! &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Results of search:&lt;/i&gt; I would question the exclusion of trials that did not present data on your outcomes of interest, or not in a usable way (&lt;a link_type=&quot;STUDY&quot; href=&quot;Wilhelmi 2010&quot; protected=&quot;true&quot;&gt;Wilhelmi 2010&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a link_type=&quot;STUDY&quot; href=&quot;Lukas 2005&quot; protected=&quot;true&quot;&gt;Lukas 2005&lt;/a&gt;), I appreciate inclusion would likely have a negligible impact on conclusions, but it is a MECIR standard to include all eligible studies, irrespective of whether they report findings in a usable way. I also wonder whether some of the detail in this section might be better placed in the appendix/PRISMA diagram, with just a summary in the main text? While I think it's really important this information is not lost as it's a valuable 'audit trail' for the development of the review, I wonder if it it's a bit too much detail for the average reader? I don't feel strongly about this if the authors are keen to keep this in the main text, but I suspect it will not be often read!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PP I have deleted details on earlier searches - however - my concern is where this info will now reside? What if someone comes back and asks why? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PP this is my only push back --- I have added more detail as to why these were excluded. I we go back and include all these studies I'd need to go right back to 1996 and look at all the abstracts again which is impossible. You have to trust me on this! haoing said we could draw a line in the sand. I'd be open to the idea of including Lukas and Wilhelmi which have been kindly translated from the german by CAG for the next iteration and include all eligible but 'no data' studies henceforth. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If we are to do this in the next review where do we write this NOTE TO SELF?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Assessment of bias: &lt;/i&gt;there appears to be a bit of inconsistency with the inclusions/exclusion of unblinded studies; the inclusion criteria states 'placebo-controlled' but in assessment of bias, it appears that 1 study (&lt;a link_type=&quot;STUDY&quot; href=&quot;Pela 1999&quot; protected=&quot;true&quot;&gt;Pela 1999&lt;/a&gt;) was open-label. Perhaps this inclusion criteria changed at some point during one of the updates? May just be worth clarifying this in the text to avoid confusion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PP yes sorry about that - have tried to fix throughout - did not need to be DB. Can be placebo controlled and not db.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Discussion:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Agree with Emma W below that the summary of main results might benefit from being shortened and focus on the sum total of evidence presented rather than breaking it down into the various updates. I found it an interesting read, seeing how evidence has evolved through the updating process, but I wonder how useful this will be to the average reader, who is more interested in knowing the current situation? PP I have deleted a lot and smoothed out! Hope it is better&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Excluded studes:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It appears that in both previous and current update studies have been excluded for not reporting outcomes of interest or not reporting them in a &amp;#8216;usable&amp;#8217; way (i.e. Wilhelmi 2010; Edwards 1976; Kasielski 2001; Lukas 2005; Maesen 1980; Michnar 1996; Rubin 1996). Although I appreciate inclusion would be very unlikely change outcomes/conclusions, it is now a MECIR standard to include them irrespective of this. It may be worth mentioning that this may need to be revisited in the next update? PP see comments abov.e&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have also carried out a 'MECIR check' on this review, which has identified one or two of the same issues, but also a couple others related to consistency. I have uploaded the checklist to the workflow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Emma W notes 29/05/2015&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Great effort going back and doing the RoB and changes look good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;suggest changing title to Mucolytic agents versus placebo for chronic bronchitis or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease OK DONE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abstract&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;add the other primary outcome 'sick days' to the abstract Done&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;please add statement about adverse effects.done&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are now encouraged to add the funding source for all studies to the notes in the characteristics of included studies table. It's a bit of a pain to do - won't insist on it for an update, but its something you might want to consider. No way at this stage - I have done it for receont one. If we are to do this in the next review where do we write this NOTE TO SELF?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Risk of bias - I counted up all the high/low/unclear risk of biases and there were some mismatches - see notes in the text fixed I hope&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Excluded studies - studies that did not evaluate outcomes - technically, these should not be excluded form the review. See above&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Delete references to GOLD 2005 and GOLD 2010 - only need most recent I think they are all gone?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;consider editing the PLS to the PLEACs standards http://editorial-unit.cochrane.org/sites/editorial-unit.cochrane.org/files/uploads/PLEACS_0.pdf&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I would like to see the summary of main results be on the current update only. It's confusing for new readers to have to read all the parts - and into sure how helpful it is for people who first read it 18 years ago - they will just want to read a snappy summary. Could you add what you have done to an appendix perhaps if you can't bear to lose it? The time trend discussion further down is clearly interesting!! Done&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Liz has added a PRISMA diagram, please check it PP looks good thanks&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;**Please could authors move the block of text regarding Peter's contribution from the 'Contributions of authors' section to the 'Acknowledgements'***. Sorry i won't move the dedication but have added a line acknowledging his work as author. Peter was important in the early days of the CAG. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CJC updated the SoF table with new data and some amendments to the downgrading decisions. Please have a look and see if you think these are reasonable or need to change. I have populated more of the RoB table, see &lt;a link_type=&quot;FIGURE&quot; href=&quot;06&quot; protected=&quot;true&quot;&gt;Figure 6&lt;/a&gt; but have two questions. Firstly if the studies are double blind should we not put them at low risk of performance and assessment bias. Secondly the decisions re attrition bias do not look very consistent at present. Is this because the old studies did not use ITT. If so this needs to be entered as a comment to help the reader.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When using the RoB for GRADE decisions in the SoF table I am only interested in the studies that contributed to that outcome. The exception is for Reporting Bias if we think the older studies measured outcomes but did not report them. The SGRQ and hospitalisations are mostly from new studies (so may be at lower risk of Bias) so not necessarily a downgrade just for this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Cates plot in &lt;a link_type=&quot;FIGURE&quot; href=&quot;03&quot; protected=&quot;true&quot;&gt;Figure 3&lt;/a&gt; has been updated to match the new OR for people with one or more exacerbations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have revised the abstract to fit better with the SoF table (I hope) and the conclusions to reflect that we have low or moderate confidence in the findings. See what you think.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RoB tables changed for selection bias in Grassi and Bachh to match the text of the risks of bias section as unclear. The section on blinding also does not match &lt;a link_type=&quot;FIGURE&quot; href=&quot;06&quot; protected=&quot;true&quot;&gt;Figure 6&lt;/a&gt;. Please revisit!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have accepted all your changes and left mine in green for you to consider. Please change anything that you don't think is right!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cheers&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chris&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CJC to create a new SoF table. Review checked back in for now. May 12th&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CJC 18 June 2012&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Final changes made (left as tracked changes) and PP alterations accepted. I am happy for this to go to copy editing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chris&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;28 May 2012 CJC changes in response to Peer review.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have added the new PLS but put in the NNT instead of rate of exacerbations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abstract updated and new Cates Plot generated! NNT is now 7 (95% CI 6-9). Mean duration is 10 months in double blind trials. Number of trials and participants added to abstract results. I do not suggest we change from OR reporting. The point of the SoF, Cates Plot and NNT are to translate this for clinical practice! Also I think we need to be cautious in interpretation as there are risks of Bias as shown in SoF table. Phillippa could you comment on whether I have been too harsh in downgrading the Summary of Findings please? Also what do we do with the discrepancy relating to methods that say trials must be double blind and the few included studies that are not?????&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whilst patients with one or more exacerbations may be less useful it avoids guessing what the true SD was in the exacerbation rates per month, so I suggest leaving this as it is! Also the peer reviewer thinks winter months should be in the abstract, so can Phillippa arbitrate on this one! Was this a prespecified outcome or post hoc, if the latter I think leave it out still.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although Worth gets less discussion on SGRQ the allocation concealment was unclear so the results may be more at risk of bias. I have added this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have linked the SoF to the new discussion paragraph and added the NNT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;30 April 2012 CJC added data from Marc DeCramer and corrected SGRQ results and included study table for DeCramer 2005&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks Emma,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am happy with the changes to the SoF and have just altered the first section of results to say mucolytics increase the odds of being free from exacerbation. I have also amended the PLS to match the abstract and PLS better (I hope).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Can we discuss where to go next on Monday? I might show this to Paul Garner and Holger as an example of how I think the tenses are best used!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cheers,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chris&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;--------------------------------------------------&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emma 18 April&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks everyone for all your changes! Did a few minor copy edits and re-ordered some of the forest plots to match the text.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Can I delete forest plot 1.1 - it is the same as analysis 1.2 (which would then need to be made into a figure and linked)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Should analysis 1.6 be relabled to match 1.5?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I made a few changes to the summary of findings tables. Are you happy with them?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;---------------------&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CJC 12 April&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Agree with amendment by Phillippa to 34.65 and 36.28 on the basis of taking off three years of annual decrease from the baseline measurements. CJC 12 April 2012&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Changed text to match the pooled data from the revised Forest plot. Also added fuller explanation of funnel plot and possibility of publication bias to the abstract. I have also modified the status of the update to conclusions changed. Do you agree?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Back to Phillippa to approve tracked changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi Phillippa, please look at my notes attached to the studies for outcome 1.12 in the data section.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chris (3 April 2012)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2012 March: CJC will work with Phillippa on the update for this review and its interpretation in particular. I will try to present the main update findings in the light of the previous review findings, as I think this will be more interesting for the reader. More recent trials and those with adequate allocation concealment are less optimistic about the benefits. Subbroup findings from DeCramer need toning down a bit I think. The funnel plot has been replaced with patients with one or more exacerbations, as the previous funnel plot indicates that the calculated variances for the monthly rates are too small. For the update primary emphasis is therefore on patients with no exacerbation. The SMD analysis has also come out as the unit of measurement (SD units) is probably wrong as the old funnel plot suggests they were too small and this is therefore misleading,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CJC cannot match text with RevMan for SGRQ results so will ask Phillippa for help here. Text in DeCramer does not match graph either! I will also need Phillippa's thoughts on the downgrading decisions in the SoF table.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emma's notes 20/12/2011&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Done CJC&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Types of interventions: no need to include the names of mucolytics you included here - unless that is an exhaustive list of the eligible interventions?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Outcomes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I would prefer to see symptom scores included as an outcome and the comment to be made in measures of treatment effect or in the discussion. The note on adverse effects, likewise, belongs in the results and discussion section&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scehermer 2009 - the NCT00184977 trial should be included as a reference in the trial and the sentence talking about it in results of the search could be rewritten. I have moved Chavannes reference into the Schermer references.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In view of the high risk of selection bias, I do not think we need to do a great deal of extra work in assessing other biases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We no longer recommend that no eligible outcome data is a criteria for exclusion - but it may not be worth the effort to change it. Perhaps the highlighted sentences in 'included studies' should be moved to 'excluded studies'? True but this is an update and I suggest we leave this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Effects of interventions&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&amp;quot;We were unable to include exacerbation data from a large American study (&lt;a link_type=&quot;STUDY&quot; href=&quot;Petty 1990&quot; protected=&quot;true&quot;&gt;Petty 1990&lt;/a&gt;; Morgan 1990) in our review.&amp;quot; - these seem to be two studies? If they are the same, the references should be combined Done&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;please report I2 values for heterogeneity More on this added by CJC&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;is this phrased correctly? &amp;quot;There was a significant reduction of 0.48 days of disability per patient per month with mucolytic therapy (95% CI -0.65 to -0.30, P &amp;lt; 0.000001, &lt;a link_type=&quot;ANALYSIS&quot; href=&quot;001.11&quot; protected=&quot;true&quot;&gt;Analysis 1.11&lt;/a&gt;).&amp;quot; OK I think&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Discussion&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Addressed CJC&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Data analyses&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;1.1 &lt;a link_type=&quot;STUDY&quot; href=&quot;Bontognali 1991&quot; protected=&quot;true&quot;&gt;Bontognali 1991&lt;/a&gt; has a huge SD - check an SE hasn't been entered by mistake. Also in 1.5.4 and 1.8.1, 1.9.1, 1.10,&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;If this was an SE it would be much smaller, Large SD means it will contribute little to results so left alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;---------------------------------------------------------&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CJC December 24th 2009&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Authors responses to the Peer Reviewer comments checked and approved.

Further possible recommendation : &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;Multi arm RCT comparing Mucolytics with ICS (not placebo) with decline in FEV1 as the main outcome&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Please also comment on the between group SGRQ results in Zheng (or mention the absence of this comparison).

I have taken out the P values from the abstract (as the only study with grade A allocation concealment is BRONCHUS, and in view of the recent Samy Suissa paper on exacerbation analysis) and will be interested to see the Peer review.&lt;br&gt;Chris.&lt;br&gt;===========================================================================&lt;br&gt;Exported from Review Manager 4.2.8&lt;br&gt;6 April&lt;br&gt;PP&lt;br&gt;Have re- inserted 6 as the NNT in the text at ****************which is 100 / 17 yellow faces? Is that right?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes to go out again for review now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;P&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exported from Review Manager 4.3 Beta&lt;br&gt;CJC Edit 5 April&lt;br&gt;Dear Phillippa,&lt;br&gt;Thanks for making these changes. I have only altered the sentence in the discussion about the risk of being free from exacerbations. Odds do not behave like risks when the events are frequent !&lt;br&gt;Toby could you use the Peto OR to generate a smiley face picture and NNT with confidence interval from the winter month reviews. The text will need adjusting to reflect this and the baseline risk used where I have put red ****************************. Then this can go out for Peer Review if PJP is happy with it.&lt;br&gt;Chris.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;==========================================================&lt;br&gt;Exported from Review Manager 4.2.8&lt;br&gt;Exported from Review Manager 4.3 Beta&lt;br&gt;CJC Editing Mar 2006 Please see red text. Thanks for the work on this important update.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PJP 30 Mar 06. THANKS CHRIS. COMMENTS BELOW IN CAPS, AND SEE RED TEXT TOO. HAVE UPDATED WHAT&amp;quot;S NEW.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Authors' Contribution: fine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What's new: helpful summary of changes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Objectives : Unchanged&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;References : checked by Liz&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Table of included studies : fine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Metaview Labels: Can you check the results in Comparison 1#5 as the Grassi trial is entered as monthly data in some places and annual in others.&lt;br&gt;WELL SPOTTED- FIXED&lt;br&gt;You could also add the Bronchus study to FEV1 from the data in the paper (and I think it would be reasonable to use the baseline SD of 0.39 for the calculated final values of FEV1). DONE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Synopsis : &amp;quot;People taking these medicines are also less likely to have an exacerbation, and if they do, it is milder.&amp;quot; I have removed this sentence as it is not a pooled outcome of the review. Also sentence added about heterogeneity. OK&lt;br&gt;ACCEPTED&lt;br&gt;Abstract : Fine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods : Fine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results : I am concerned about the partial disclosure of results from the manufacturers and a funnel plot of Comparison 1#1 is highly suggestive of publication bias.&lt;br&gt;YES NOW MENTIONED AS A REASON FOR THE REDUCING EFFECT SIZE OVER THE YEARS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This needs to be highlighted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also the huge heterogeneity levels need to be mentioned in the results for the main outcomes at least and when this is discussed you could point out that the monthly SDs are imputed and this could narrow the confidence intervals for the individual studies (increasing heterogeneity) as well as the confidence interval for the pooled results.&lt;br&gt;MENTIONED IN RESULTS AND DISCUSSION -HIGHLIGHTED IN RED&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;There is significant heterogeneity among the studies included in these analyses&amp;quot; added to Results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I would recommend taking out the tiny P values as these are not secure in view of the above.&lt;br&gt;HAVE CHANGED ALL TINY ONES TO P &amp;lt; 0.01, IS THAT BETTER?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I would suggest adding hospital admission as a dichotomous outcome, as this is available from at least 2 of the new studies.&lt;br&gt;YES HAVE DONE, GOOD SUGGESTION&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mortality is also mentioned in BRONCHUS.&lt;br&gt;HAVE ADDED THIS TOO.. FOUR STUDIES HAD COMPARATIVE DATA&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Discussion : I would suggest revision of the paragraph about publication bias! I think this is over optimistic. I am also unsure that the days of disability goes beyond that expected by the reduction in exacerbations and this needs justification.&lt;br&gt;REWORDED&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Contentious issues : I remain uncomfortable about the SD for monthly data. The mean monthly difference should end up as one twelfth of the annual difference, but the SD could actually be larger than the annual SD, as the month to month variations within patients will probably be large and the data is skewed (as mentioned in the BRONCHUS study). AGREE CHRIS BUT THINK THE APPROACH IS JUSTIFIED AS HAVE USED SMD AS A CHECK. IT IS INTERNALLY CONSISTENT WITH THE OTHER DICHOTOMOUS MEASURE OF NO EXACERBATIONS IN THE STUDY PERIOD. NOT GOING TO CHANGE IT NOW. I DID ASK A STATISTICIAN EARLY ON IN THE PIECE AND REMEMBER DOING A MATHEMATICAL PROOF OF IT ....WHERE THAT IS!!!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next action : back to authors please Toby.&lt;br&gt;=============================================================&lt;br&gt;Exported from Review Manager 4.2.8&lt;br&gt;2005: Total overhaul- whole study updated. 3 new studies including 3 year BRONCHUS study of 600mg NAC/day, and AMETHIST and EQUALIFE studies. . Discussion and conclusions seen by Peter Black. Spell checked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wonder if original review sparked interest in more studies? Hopefully more to follow soon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2003: PP reviewed a new study on ambroxol for 12/12 in COPD (Amethist trial).

Authors have not replied yet to query.&lt;br&gt;Added new comparisons-exacerbations per patient regardless of duration, patients with no exacerbations, thiol donor vs placebo, changed FEV1 outcome to FEV1or %FEV1 or PEFR (using SMD)&lt;br&gt;Added new studies (Cegla, Meister (2), Ekberg-Jansson, Nowak, Pela, Grillage, Jackson)&lt;br&gt;corrected spelling and hypertext links&lt;br&gt;checked all data and entries&lt;br&gt;recalculated all SDs-slight changes except for Parr SD -now estimated by pooled SD from other studies -Chris/Peter/Paul is this all right to do? I have presented the result with it in and with it out. My original calculation was from the paper and I think wrong formula in hindsight -it gave it too much weight.&lt;br&gt;calculated weighted (for study size) annualised control event rate at 2.7 per year&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PP needs to add P values back in&lt;br&gt;PP needs to look at Christensen again&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PJP notes 4/8/2&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wider search strategy&lt;br&gt;No new studies identified. Number of eligible studies 23.&lt;br&gt;Wider discussion incorporating details of other NAC meta-analyses and cost effectiveness analysis (Grandjean x 2 and Stey)&lt;br&gt;Checked progress on BREATHE study- not known to Zambon (Ida Lankhorst). No response to fax to Dr Nowak in Poland&lt;br&gt;BRONCHUS study mentioned - Decramer et al due to report in 3 years&lt;br&gt;Added Jadad scores&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Technical Editing by CJC 20_9_2&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What's New: fine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Authors and contributions: fine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;References: fine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Table of included studies: very full.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Metaview Labels: fine but single study totals in comparison 2 switched off.&lt;br&gt;THERE WAS AN ERROR IN THE ENTRY OF THE BABOLINI DATA FOR THE SUBGROUP OF NAC 400MG. I HAVE CORRECTED THIS TO MATCH THE DATA IN THE FIRST SUBGROUP FOR ALL NAC DOSES AND THIS CHANGES THE POINT ESTIMATE TO -.18 EXACERBATIONS PER MONTH. 95% CI MINUS 0.21 TO MINUS 0.14 FOR THIS SUBGROUP. This result is not quoted in the text so no changes to the text have been made.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SYNOPSIS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;METHODS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RESULTS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;DISCUSSION&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;For this outcome, there was, however, significant heterogeneity between the studies (chi square 105.78, df 16, P &amp;lt; 0.001). To explore the causes for this, we divided the studies according to the baseline FEV1 (as % predicted), the type of mucolytic, dose of mucolytic, whether subjects were included because they had a history of exacerbations, the duration of therapy and the country in which the study was conducted. There was less heterogeneity in the 2 studies in which FEV1 was less than 50% predicted (chi square 0.44, df=1, n.s.), and in those conducted outside Italy (chi square 6.91, df = 6, n.s.).&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IN MY VIEW THIS IS AN INCORRECT USE OF SUBGROUP ANALYSIS. I SUGGEST INSTEAD THAT THE ANALYSIS IS DONE ON SMD ONLY (TO GET AROUND THE PROBLEMS OF STUDY DURATION ETC) AND THE SUBGROUPS ARE COMPARED WITH EACH OTHER USING THE RESIDUAL CHI TEST SCORES. THIS SHOWS A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE ITALIAN AND OTHER STUDIES (USING SMD THE TOTAL CHI SCORE IS 57.04 AND THE TWO SUBGROUPS TOTAL 40.71, THE DIFFERENCE IS 16.23 AND ON ONE DEGREE OF FREEDOM THIS IS VERY SIGNIFICANT, p=0.00006). IN CONTRAST FOR FEV1 THE RESIDUAL CHI RESULT IS 17.55 MINUS 17.37 = 0.18, AND THIS IS NOT SIGNIFICANT).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The reduction in the exacerbation rate was greater for the studies which lasted 3 months or less (0.132 per patient per month) than those which were more than 3 months in duration (0.059 per patient per month). This suggests that, within a population of patients, the full benefit is seen within the first few months of treatment and does not increase subsequently.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;ALTERNATIVELY LONGER STUDIES INCLUDED THE SUMMER AS ALREADY SUGGESTED. DURATION OF THERAPY IS INTERESTING BECAUSE USING WMD THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SUBGROUPS (MORE EFFECT IN SHORTER DURATION STUDIES) BUT NOT USING SMD. THIS MAY BE RELATED TO WEIGHTING AS STUDIES WITH FEW EXACERBATIONS (AND HENCE SMALLER WMD) TEND TO ATTRACT MORE WEIGHT WITH WMD ANALYSIS THAN SMD. GREAT CAUTION IS NEEDED IN INTERPRETATION THEREFORE.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do you wish to alter the discussion, or would you like me just to send this on to Paul as it stands?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;19_11_2002&lt;br&gt;This seems to have got lost in the system so asked Toby to send this back to the authors again to respond to the notes section please!&lt;br&gt;CJC&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;responses PJP 30/9/02&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear Chris and Toby&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks for the feedback.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Comments relating to the points made below are:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(i) Yes well spotted on the error in Babolini in NAC 400 subgroup- should have been suspicious about the weights.&lt;br&gt;(ii) re: Discussion topics:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;None of the points have been raised previously by either editors or others- these conclusions have been in the review since the beginning. However, that is not to justify them necessarily!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I appreciate that SMDs are more conservative, and that weights change slightly with them, and that if there is a difference in results with WMD and SMD need to be cautious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I did once go through the maths and figured out that calculating the rate per month e.g. x/6, will result in dividing the SD by 6 and mean by 6 hence the standardised mean will remain unchanged? Is that wrong?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Agree the subgroup analyses are supposed to be hypothesis generating and not conclusive. Perhaps this needs to be stated more strongly. They are there to assist the readers and future researchers to identify possible groups in which the therapy MAY be more effective, or to identify issues with trial design and conduct which may have introduced heterogeneity. Clearly one needs to be more wary if there is heterogeneity- although the internal consistency of this study, and the number of trials tends to favour more robust results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We struggled to think of a sensitive way to put the non Italian country observation. We felt it important to state as there have been questions raised about trial conduct in certain parts of the world, and of course, the different patterns of use of medicines. Is there a better way to state this?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are far fewer studies in the FEV1 outcome than the exacerbation outcome and as it is a secondary outcome so I wasn't strongly of a mind to use the FEV1 data for anything other than to say there doesn't seem to be a major effect of mucolytics on this on outcome- certainly not for subgroup analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With respect to the study duration observation- I do not agree that an explanation of the difference bet &amp;lt;3 and &amp;gt;=3 months was the inclusion of the summer months. All studies except one (Cegla 24 months) were 6 months or less, and conducted over the winter months. However, for reasons pointed out ( diff bet SMD and WMD) the conclusion could be toned down. If effect is similar in &amp;lt; 3 months and &amp;gt; = 3 month trials the conclusion is that the benefit occurs early on, is sustained and doesn't increase subsequently. Not sure if this is that much different to what is already written.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;10_12_2002&lt;br&gt;Toby,&lt;br&gt;Could you pass this on to Paul to see if he wants to adjust the text to reflect my concerns or whether he is happy to leave things as they stand. I don't need to do any more technical editing.&lt;br&gt;PLEASE ENSURE THAT THIS VERSION IS USED AS THE ARE ERRORS IN THE ONE WITH PJP COMMENTS IN THAT YOU SENT ME!&lt;br&gt;Chris.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" NOTES_MODIFIED="2015-07-29 09:18:32 +0100" NOTES_MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh" REVIEW_NO="MUC-COP" REVMAN_SUB_VERSION="5.3.5 " REVMAN_VERSION="5" SPLIT_FROM="" STAGE="R" STATUS="A" TYPE="INTERVENTION" VERSION_NO="11.2">

<P>1999: 2 studies in patients with COPD now included in the review, hence the title change. Data on 2 other agents - myrtol and the thiol donor N-isobutyrylcysteine - also included. Eight additional studies and several new analyses included<BR/>
<BR/>Correction made to reviewers' conclusions on the effects of mucolytics on the secondary endpoint of lung function. Our extracteddata checked against original data and confirmed as correct. Small standard deviations in the Olivieri study noted; possibility that study authors reported standard errors. P values quoted in study analysis compatible with this conclusion. Until clarification, this trial removed from analysis. No significant change in lung function noted in data analysis (previously interpreted as favouring placebo). Changes made to relevant parts of Abstract, Results (Lung Function) and Discussion sections<BR/>
<BR/>No change to overall conclusions of this review with respect to primary endpoint of exacerbation frequency and days of disability ('sick days'). High level of heterogeneity in the size of this effect between trials unclear; possibility that length of study is the cause of this should be examined in a future version of this review<BR/>
<BR/>For adverse effects, Parr and Rasmussen data taken out of meta-analysis and reported instead in text because event rates in these studies exceeded numbers in treatment groups. RevMan unable to manage dichotomous data when event rate exceeds 1. Possibility that adverse effects may be less frequent in the mucolytic-treated group as suggested by meta-analysis. In large study by Parr (n = 526), mean of 4.9 adverse effects reported per participant in the mucolytic group vs 4.5 adverse effects per participant in the placebo group. Therefore, no changes made to our original conclusion and no differences between treatments in terms of adverse effects</P>

<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2015-07-22 10:04:25 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">
<P>Mucolytics are medicines taken orally that may loosen sputum, making it easier to cough it up. Mucolytics may have other beneficial effects on lung infection and inflammation and may be useful in the treatment of people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or chronic bronchitis. This review assessed how effective they were in these patients. Review authors looked at 34 studies with a total of 9367 patients. Results showed a small reduction in the number of exacerbations (worsening of disease/symptoms) experienced by the patient if the medication was taken on a regular basis - that is, approximately one less patient with an exacerbation for every eight treated with a mucolytic over 10 months. However, this review includes a mix of small older studies and large newer ones, with newer ones showing less benefit. The medicines appear to be safe and well tolerated; however we are unsure about their impact on quality of life and on risk of hospitalisation.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2015-07-22 10:04:16 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">
<P>Individuals with chronic bronchitis or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) may suffer recurrent exacerbations with an increase in volume or purulence of sputum, or both. Personal and healthcare costs associated with exacerbations indicate that any therapy that reduces the occurrence of exacerbations is useful. A marked difference among countries in terms of prescribing of mucolytics reflects variation in perceptions of their effectiveness.</P>

<P>
<B>Primary objective</B>
</P>
<P>&#8226; To determine whether treatment with mucolytics reduces frequency of exacerbations and/or days of disability in patients with chronic bronchitis or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.</P>

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2015-07-22 10:04:16 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register and reference lists of articles on 10 separate occasions, most recently in July 2014.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2015-07-22 10:04:16 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">
<P>We included randomised studies that compared oral mucolytic therapy versus placebo for at least two months in adults with chronic bronchitis or COPD. We excluded studies of people with asthma and cystic fibrosis.</P>

<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2015-07-22 10:04:16 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">
<P>This review analysed summary data only, most derived from published studies. For earlier versions, one review author extracted data, which were rechecked in subsequent updates. In later versions, review authors double-checked extracted data and then entered data into RevMan for analysis.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-07-22 10:04:16 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">
<P>We added four studies for the 2014 update. The review now includes 34 trials, recruiting a total of 9367 participants. Many studies did not clearly describe allocation concealment; hence selection bias may have inflated the results, which reduces our confidence in the findings.</P>
<P>Results of 26 studies with 6233 participants show that the likelihood that a patient could be exacerbation-free during the study period was greater among mucolytic groups (Peto odds ratio (OR) 1.75, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.57 to 1.94). However, more recent studies show less benefit of treatment than was reported in earlier studies in this review. The overall number needed to treat with mucolytics for an additional beneficial outcome for an average of 10 months - to keep an additional participant free from exacerbations - was eight (NNTB 8, 95% CI 7 to 10). Use of mucolytics was associated with a reduction of 0.03 exacerbations per participant per month (mean difference (MD) -0.03, 95% CI -0.04 to -0.03; participants = 7164; studies = 28; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 85%) compared with placebo, that is, about 0.36 per year, or one exacerbation every three years. Very high heterogeneity was noted for this outcome, so results need to be interpreted with caution. The type or dose of mucolytic did not seem to alter the effect size, nor did the severity of COPD, including exacerbation history. Longer studies showed smaller effects of mucolytics than were reported in shorter studies.</P>
<P>Mucolytic use was associated with a reduction of 0.43 days of disability per participant per month compared with placebo (95% CI -0.56 to -0.30; studies = 13; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 61%). With mucolytics, the number of people with one or more hospitalisations was reduced, but study results were not consistent (Peto OR 0.68, 95% CI 0.52 to 0.89; participants = 1788; studies = 4; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 58%). Investigators reported improved quality of life with mucolytics (MD -2.64, 95% CI -5.21 to -0.08; participants = 2231; studies = 5; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 51%). Although this mean difference did not reach the minimal clinically important difference of -4 units, we cannot assess the population impact, as we do not have the data needed to carry out a responder analysis. Mucolytic treatment was not associated with any significant increase in the total number of adverse effects, including mortality (Peto OR 1.03, 95% CI 0.52 to 2.03; participants = 2931; studies = 8; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%), but the confidence interval is too wide to confirm that the treatment has no effect on mortality.</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2015-07-22 10:04:16 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">
<P>In participants with chronic bronchitis or COPD, we are moderately confident that treatment with mucolytics may produce a small reduction in acute exacerbations and a small effect on overall quality of life. Our confidence in the results is reduced by the fact that effects on exacerbations shown in early trials were larger than those reported by more recent studies, possibly because the earlier smaller trials were at greater risk of selection or publication bias, thus benefits of treatment may not be as great as was suggested by previous evidence.<BR/>

<BODY MODIFIED="2015-07-29 09:18:32 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2015-07-22 11:21:09 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2015-07-22 11:21:09 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">
<P>At least 50% of smokers will develop chronic bronchitis (<LINK REF="REF-Redline-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Redline 1991</LINK>). This is often defined as the presence of chronic productive cough for three months in each of two successive years in a patient for whom other causes of chronic cough such as tuberculosis, carcinoma of the lung and heart failure have been excluded (<LINK REF="REF-MRC-1965" TYPE="REFERENCE">MRC 1965</LINK>). Many patients with chronic bronchitis also have chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). In the latest global COPD guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-GOLD-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">GOLD 2015</LINK>), COPD is defined as a common, preventable and treatable disease, characterised by persistent airflow limitation that is usually progressive and associated with an enhanced chronic inflammatory response to noxious particles or gases in the airways and the lung. Exacerbations and co-morbidities contribute to overall severity in individual patients.</P>
<P>It is estimated that COPD is the fourth or fifth most common single cause of death worldwide. Currently no cure for COPD is known, although it is a preventable and treatable disease. Apart from smoking cessation and long-term oxygen therapy in hypoxic patients, no intervention has been shown to reduce mortality (<LINK REF="REF-GOLD-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">GOLD 2015</LINK>).</P>
<P>People with COPD may experience chronic and progressive breathlessness, cough and sputum production, which in turn may lead to restricted activity and worsening quality of life. Exacerbations occur with increasing frequency as the disease becomes more severe. They are characterised by increased breathlessness or greater volume or purulence of sputum or both. Exacerbations accelerate decline in lung function and are associated with worse quality of life and higher mortality. They are the largest contributor to healthcare costs in COPD (<LINK REF="REF-Criner-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Criner 2015</LINK>). Thus, treatments that reduce the frequency and duration of acute exacerbations will provide benefits for both individual patients and healthcare systems.</P>
</CONDITION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2015-07-22 10:06:16 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">
<P>Mucolytics are oral medicines that are believed to increase expectoration of sputum by reducing its viscosity, thus making it easier to cough it up. Given that oxidative stress is thought to be an amplifying mechanism in COPD (<LINK REF="REF-Rahman-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rahman 2005</LINK>), a property of mucolytics such as N-acetylcysteine that may be useful in chronic airways disease is an antioxidant effect.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2015-07-22 10:06:16 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">
<P>In some European countries, mucolytics are widely prescribed in the belief that they reduce the frequency of exacerbations or symptoms or both in patients with chronic bronchitis. In contrast, in other parts of the world, such as the UK and Australasia, mucolytics are used infrequently because they are perceived to be ineffective. As theoretical reasons have been proposed to explain why mucolytics may work in both chronic bronchitis and COPD, and because treatments that reduce exacerbations are needed to reduce morbidity and costs, this review will seek to determine the true effect of this class of medicines.</P>

<P>Participants must have received regular treatment with oral mucolytics or placebo for at least two months. Oral mucolytics included the following compounds: N-acetylcysteine (NAC), S-carboxymethylcysteine, bromhexine, ambroxol, erdosteine, sobrerol, cithiolone, letosteine and iodinated glycerol. The 1999 update of this review included two studies of newer agents: <LINK REF="STD-Ekberg_x002d_Jansson-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Ekberg-Jansson 1999</LINK>, in which a thiol donor derivative of NAC with antioxidant properties, N-isobutyrylcysteine, was used; and <LINK REF="STD-Meister-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Meister 1999</LINK>, which used a mucus-modifying agent, myrtol.

This study has now been published and is included in the review (<LINK REF="STD-Schermer-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Schermer 2009</LINK>). In 2012, we contacted the lead author of <LINK REF="STD-Decramer-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Decramer 2005</LINK> to clarify conflicting information on quality of life in the published report; the lead author helpfully provided us with information derived from the St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ).</P>

<P>Potential for bias in most studies was regarded as unclear, in that study authors stated that the study was randomised but did not indicate how this was achieved, where it was done or how it was concealed.

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Patients with no exacerbations during study period</HEADING>
<P>The odds ratio (OR) for having no exacerbations over the entire study period when treatment with mucolytics was provided in double-blind trials was increased compared with placebo (Peto OR 1.75, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.57 to 1.94; <LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>). This yielded a number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) of 8 (95% CI 7 to 10; <LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK>). However, as heterogeneity in this result is high (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 63%), we carried out a post hoc subgroup analysis showing results of double-blind trials by decade of publication (<LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>; <LINK REF="FIG-04" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 4</LINK>). This revealed a tendency for more recent studies to provide more conservative results: Studies published before 1990 (Peto OR 2.34, 95% CI 1.97 to 2.79) and between 1990 and 1999 (Peto OR 1.91, 95% CI 1.50 to 2.44) have a greater effect size than those published since 2000 (Peto OR 1.21, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.43). It is also notable that the four studies with adequate allocation concealment (<LINK REF="STD-Decramer-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Decramer 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schermer-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Schermer 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zheng-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Zheng 2008</LINK>. <LINK REF="STD-Zheng-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Zheng 2014</LINK>) did not report a major benefit of treatment in preventing exacerbations.</P>
<P>Furthermore, inspection of the funnel plot in <LINK REF="FIG-05" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 5</LINK> suggests the possibility of 'small study' effects, as no small studies show negative outcomes. This raises the possibility that some negative small studies may not have been published, and publication bias could lead to overestimation of the benefits of treatment for exacerbations.</P>
<P>If the analysis is conducted only on studies conducted over eight months during winter, the effect is larger, with an odds ratio of 2.20 (95% CI 1.93 to 2.51; P value &lt; 0.00001; <LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Number of exacerbations per participant per month</HEADING>
<P>Use of mucolytics was associated with a reduction of 0.03 exacerbations per participant per month (95% CI -0.04 to -0.03; <LINK REF="CMP-001.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.4</LINK>). These results need to be interpreted with caution, as very high heterogeneity was detected in this outcome (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 85%). One factor may relate to the scaling factors used in estimating the standard deviations of monthly exacerbation rates, which may have led to over-precision in the estimates from each study. For this reason, monthly exacerbation results may be less reliable than those pertaining to the outcome above that assessed whether participants had experienced an exacerbation during the study period.</P>
<P>We were unable to include in our review exacerbation data from a large American study (<LINK REF="STD-Petty-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Petty 1990</LINK>). The paper reported no significant differences in exacerbation rates between groups treated with iodinated glycerol and those given placebo, but no data were available on this outcome.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Parr-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Parr 1987</LINK> reported no measurements of error for their exacerbation rate. Owing to the large number of included studies and the fact that this was a large study, we decided to assign it the pooled standard deviation (SD). If <LINK REF="STD-Parr-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Parr 1987</LINK> is excluded, no change in effect size is seen. <LINK REF="STD-Malerba-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Malerba 2004</LINK> also made no mention of the SD but did report the number with no exacerbations and the total number of exacerbations, from which the mean was calculated. A very conservative estimate of the SD has been applied (approximately 10 times that which would be obtained if the rest of the participants had one, two or three exacerbations in a skewed distribution in the ratio 64%:32%:4%).</P>
<P>In contrast to the results reported for mucolytics, no significant reduction in exacerbation rates was observed with the thiol donor N-isobutyrylcysteine (NIC). Addition of NIC to the main analysis resulted in no change in overall effect size.</P>
<P>A significant difference in this outcome was reported by study duration - those studies lasting 12 months or longer had a smaller effect than average (0.02 fewer per month, 95% CI -0.02 to -0.01), and those completed within three months showed a greater effect (test for subgroup differences: Chi = 60.95, df = 2; P value &lt; 0.00001; <LINK REF="CMP-001.08" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.8</LINK>).</P>
<P>Effect size did not vary by type of mucolytic or dose (<LINK REF="CMP-001.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.5</LINK>), by lung function at baseline (<LINK REF="CMP-001.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.6</LINK>) or by whether participants had a history of exacerbations (<LINK REF="CMP-001.10" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.10</LINK>).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Exacerbations in patients not given inhaled corticosteroids (ICS)</HEADING>
<P>A meta-analysis of earlier studies, which were defined or stratified by non-use of concomitant ICS (<LINK REF="STD-Decramer-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Decramer 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Malerba-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Malerba 2004;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Schermer-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Schermer 2009</LINK>; see <LINK REF="CMP-001.07" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.7</LINK>), found no significant differences in exacerbation rates between those treated with mucolytics and those given placebo (MD 0.02; 95% CI -0.01 to 0.04). One recent study (<LINK REF="STD-Zheng-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Zheng 2014</LINK>) noted no significant interaction between ICS use and treatment effect (P value = 0.27). Another study (<LINK REF="STD-Roy-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Roy 2014</LINK>) excluded participants given ICS but provided no reportable data on exacerbations.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Time to first exacerbation</HEADING>
<P>Sufficient data with which to perform a meta-analysis are not yet available for this clinically relevant outcome. Post hoc analysis of the EQUALIFE study (<LINK REF="REF-Ballabio-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ballabio 2008</LINK>) revealed that participants given erdosteine had a significantly longer time until their first exacerbation compared with those given placebo, with a hazard ratio of 0.639 (95% CI 0.416 to 0.981). Longer time to first exacerbation was also reported by <LINK REF="STD-Nowak-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Nowak 1999</LINK>. In that study, participants with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) treated with N-acetylcysteine (NAC) had a mean of 139 days (SD 68) to first exacerbation versus 108 (79) days for those given placebo (P value &lt; 0.05). More recently, <LINK REF="STD-Zheng-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Zheng 2014</LINK> reported no differences between time to first exacerbation in NAC- or control-treated groups, but time to second and third exacerbations was shorter in the control group.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Number of days of disability per participant per month ('sick days')</HEADING>
<P>Thirteen studies showed a significant reduction of 0.43 days of disability per participant per month with mucolytic therapy (95% CI -0.56 to -0.30; <LINK REF="CMP-001.11" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.11</LINK>) compared with placebo. This finding was associated with a high level of heterogeneity (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 61%).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Moretti-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Moretti 2004</LINK> did not report total 'sick days'; however, investigators did report the numbers of individuals losing workdays: seven in the erdosteine group and 10 in the placebo group, for a mean number of days lost per person of 0.8 and 1.1, respectively.</P>
<P>In the three studies that reported it, a mean reduction of 0.53 days on antibiotics per participant per month was observed (95% CI -0.76 to -0.31; <LINK REF="CMP-001.12" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.12</LINK>). These were older studies that included participants with chronic bronchitis. In the study of <LINK REF="STD-Meister-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Meister 1999</LINK>, 6/31 (52%) participants in the myrtol group with exacerbations needed antibiotics, compared with 30/49 (61%) in the placebo group. Courses of antibiotics were longer in the placebo group. The percentage of participants who needed antibiotics for longer than seven days was 37% in the myrtol group and 77% in the placebo group. <LINK REF="STD-Malerba-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Malerba 2004</LINK> reported no differences between ambroxol and placebo in terms of duration of courses of antibiotic treatment, working days lost or number of days of hospitalisation (no data given). <LINK REF="REF-Moretti-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moretti 2007</LINK> used post hoc analyses to report that compared with placebo, erdosteine use was associated with relatively fewer antibiotic courses (32%) and shorter durations of treatment (15%). The mean number of antibiotic courses per participant treated with erdosteine was also lower than for those given placebo (0.5 (SD 0.7) vs 0.7 (SD 0.7); P value = 0.045).</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Health-related quality of life</HEADING>
<P>Although many studies reported participant and/or physician global assessments of well-being, only eight used validated tools to evaluate health-related quality of life among participants with COPD. In seven studies (<LINK REF="STD-De-Backer-2013" TYPE="STUDY">De Backer 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Decramer-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Decramer 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moretti-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Moretti 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tse-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Tse 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Worth-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Worth 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zheng-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Zheng 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zheng-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Zheng 2014</LINK>), investigators used the St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ; <LINK REF="REF-Jones-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jones 1992</LINK>), and in one study (<LINK REF="STD-Schermer-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Schermer 2009</LINK>), researchers used the Chronic Respiratory Questionnaire (CRQ; <LINK REF="REF-Guyatt-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guyatt 1987</LINK>).</P>
<P>The SGRQ total score is derived from scores on three subscales - symptoms, activities and impacts - to yield a score out of 100 (<LINK REF="REF-Jones-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jones 1992</LINK>). A well person has respiratory disease scores around 7 (<LINK REF="REF-Jones-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jones 1992</LINK>). Lower scores indicate better quality of life.</P>
<P>When they were reported, we combined total scores on the SGRQ at the end of the treatment period (<LINK REF="CMP-001.13" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.13</LINK>). This revealed a small, statistically significant effect in favour of mucolytics when a fixed-effect model was used (MD -2.60, 95% CI -4.29 to -0.9) and when a random-effects model was applied (MD -2.64, 95% CI -5.21 to -0.08). Considerable heterogeneity among studies was apparent (I <SUP>2</SUP> = 51%). This effect does not meet the minimum clinically important difference of -4 units on the SGRQ (<LINK REF="REF-Jones-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jones 2005</LINK>). However it is not possible to assess the impact of mucolytics at a population level without performing a responder analysis, and the size of the treatment effect was similar to that of tiotropium in comparison with placebo (<LINK REF="REF-Karner-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Karner 2014</LINK>).</P>
<P>The analysis includes data from the three-year <LINK REF="STD-Decramer-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Decramer 2005</LINK> study of 600 mg NAC daily, in which participants were evaluated with the SGRQ, although for technical reasons only about 80% of participants completed the questionnaire. During the first year of the study, participants in both treatment and placebo groups showed significantly improved scores on both scales, with no significant differences between groups (-3.76 units on NAC and -4.95 units on placebo; difference between groups 1.18; P value = 0.358, as reported in the text of the paper). In the second year, this improvement tailed off again, with no differences noted between treatment groups. More participants given placebo withdrew from the trial, and dropouts had a worse SGRQ score than those who remained in the study. We have used data provided by study authors as obtained from the mixed-effects model used in this study.</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Zheng-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Zheng 2008</LINK>, baseline SGRQ scores were well matched among groups. After 12 months of treatment, changes in SGRQ total scores from baseline amounted to -4.06 units in the carbocysteine group and -0.05 in the placebo group, but these values did not represent a statistically significant difference between groups (P value = 0.13). A very large difference in SGRQ symptom domain results between the carbocysteine group (-11.34 units) and the placebo group (-3.54 units; P value = 0.004) remains unexplained. Results from the single measurement obtained at one year in this study contrast with multiple measurements taken in <LINK REF="STD-Decramer-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Decramer 2005</LINK>, by which no significant differences in symptom scores between NAC and placebo were found over time.</P>
<P>In the <LINK REF="STD-Worth-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Worth 2009</LINK> study, the mean score change at six months from baseline was -4.3 in the placebo group and -9.9 in the cineole group (P value = 0.06). However, we judged this study to be at high risk of selection bias.</P>
<P>In the eight-month <LINK REF="STD-Moretti-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Moretti 2004</LINK> study of erdosteine, participants completed both Short Form (SF)-36 and the SGRQ. The erdosteine-treated group showed significant improvement in all domains of the SGRQ, as well as in total score, and no differences between treated and placebo groups were reported. Data were not suitable for inclusion in <LINK REF="CMP-001.13" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.13</LINK>.</P>
<P>In the three-year study of NAC versus placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Schermer-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Schermer 2009</LINK>), the CRQ was used. Groups were well matched at baseline, with evident improvement in both groups, particularly over the first year, but this never exceeded the 0.5 unit threshold regarded as clinically significant (<LINK REF="REF-Guyatt-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guyatt 1987</LINK>). At the end of the study, no significant differences in CRQ total scores were reported between groups (P value = 0.306).</P>
<P>Thus, considerable variation can be seen in evidence related to health-related quality of life, and we are not able to assess whether mucolytics had a clinically important effect on this outcome.</P>

The odds ratio (OR) for hospitalisation with mucolytic treatment compared with placebo was 0.68 (95% CI 0.52 to 0.89; <LINK REF="CMP-001.14" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.14</LINK>); however, considerable heterogeneity in this result was observed (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 58%), and benefit was seen only in the two smaller studies (<LINK REF="STD-Moretti-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Moretti 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tse-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Tse 2013</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Malerba-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Malerba 2004</LINK> reported no significant differences in hospitalisation rates but did not provide data. <LINK REF="STD-Bachh-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Bachh 2007</LINK> reported a significant reduction (P value &lt; 0.05) in hospitalisations when four months of NAC treatment was provided, with 55 hospitalisations reported for 50 participants in the control group but for only 37 of 50 in the treated group. As presented, these data cannot be included in the meta-analysis because the number of events exceeds the number of participants in the control group. If a conservative estimate of hospitalisations in the control group is made by entering them as 50 (not 55), the beneficial effect of mucolytics on hospitalisation is greater (OR 0.62, 95% CI 0.48 to 0.80) but heterogeneity is increased (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 76%). Mucolytics may be associated with a small decrease in hospitalisations.</P>
<P>Days in hospital were reported by <LINK REF="STD-Moretti-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Moretti 2004</LINK>. In this study, participants taking erdosteine spent 70 days in hospital, compared with 163 days for the placebo group (P value = 0.04). This represented a mean of 1.1 days per treated participant compared with 2.7 days per control participant.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Lung function</HEADING>
<P>All studies that reported a simple measure of airways obstruction are combined in the outcome of forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV<SUB>1</SUB>) or %FEV<SUB>1</SUB> or peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR), which shows a significant difference at the end of treatment between mucolytic-treated and placebo-treated participants favouring mucolytic therapy (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.09, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.16; <LINK REF="CMP-001.15" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.15</LINK>). Significant heterogeneity is apparent in this result (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 64%), so it must be interpreted with caution. If only double-blind studies are included, the effect size is a little smaller (SMD 0.08, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.00 to 0.15).</P>
<P>This analysis includes data from the <LINK REF="STD-Moretti-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Moretti 2004</LINK> study, which reported a significant difference (&gt; 300 mL) between mucolytic and placebo groups at the end of the study; however the mucolytic group had higher baseline lung function, and the net change was therefore closer to 200 mL. If this study is removed from the analysis, a significant difference between groups is no longer observed and heterogeneity is removed.</P>
<P>Ten studies reported a small but significant 50 mL difference in forced vital capacity (FVC) at the end of the study period between participants treated with mucolytics and those given placebo (<LINK REF="CMP-001.16" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.16</LINK>) (MD 0.05, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.08).</P>
<P>In contrast, the BRONCUS study of <LINK REF="STD-Decramer-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Decramer 2005</LINK> found no differences between NAC-treated and placebo-treated groups over three years in terms of decline in FEV<SUB>1</SUB>, FVC or diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO). FEV<SUB>1</SUB> declined by 54 mL and 47 mL, respectively, in the two groups. Study authors reported a possible benefit of NAC on functional residual capacity (FRC), with a greater reduction in this measure. The difference was -0.374 litres (SD 1.03, P value &lt; 0.01) for NAC-treated participants, whereas for those treated with placebo, a decrease of only 0.008 L was reported. Moreover, the other three-year study (<LINK REF="STD-Schermer-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Schermer 2009</LINK>) found no differences between groups in lung function at the end of the study. In the NAC-treated group, FEV<SUB>1</SUB> declined by 64 mL, and in the placebo group, by 60 mL. The decline in FVC was 79 mL and 65 mL, respectively.</P>
<P>In another large, well-conducted RCT (<LINK REF="STD-Zheng-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Zheng 2008</LINK>), mean post-bronchodilator FEV<SUB>1</SUB> and oxygen saturations at the end of the study were not significantly different between those in placebo and carbocysteine-treated groups. <LINK REF="STD-Malerba-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Malerba 2004</LINK> also reported no differences in simple lung function over a one-year study of ambroxol versus placebo, although no data were given.</P>
<P>In the HIACE study of <LINK REF="STD-Tse-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Tse 2013</LINK>, a significantly higher mean FEV<SUB>1</SUB> was reported for the NAC group at the end of the study, but this reflected differences at baseline, with no significant differences in the amount of change reported between groups. On the other hand, researchers reported significantly greater changes in the NAC group than in the placebo group for two measures of small airways function: forced expiratory flow at 25% to 50% (FEF<SUB>25-50</SUB>) (P value = 0.037) and forced oscillation technique (FOT) (P value = 0.04),as well as for airways resistance (P value = 0.01).</P>
<P>Recently, a cross-over study (<LINK REF="STD-De-Backer-2013" TYPE="STUDY">De Backer 2013</LINK>) examined the effects of high-dose NAC given for three months on the geometry of airways in 12 participants. For most participants, no significant changes in spirometry or airways resistance were reported; however, two participants showed larger changes, raising the possibility of a responder phenotype.</P>
<P>In summary, it is likely that if mucolytics affect disease progression in chronic bronchitis or COPD, changes are very small and are confined to as-yet small and undefined subgroups.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Adverse effects</HEADING>
<P>The meta-analysis of total numbers of adverse effects marginally favours mucolytic treatment, but with some heterogeneity (Peto OR 0.88, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.00; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 37%; <LINK REF="CMP-001.17" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.17</LINK>). If a random-effects model is used, this finding is not statistically significant (OR 0.86, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.03). Moreover, this analysis does not include data from several large studies. <LINK REF="STD-Parr-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Parr 1987</LINK> reported 1263 events in 258 participants in the mucolytics group (mean 4.9 per participant) and 1202 events in 268 participants in the placebo group (mean 4.5 per participant). <LINK REF="STD-Decramer-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Decramer 2005</LINK> reported 1428 events in 256 participants in the mucolytics group (mean 5.58 per participant) and 1381 events among 267 participants in the placebo group (mean 5.17 per participant). None were thought to be drug-related. Similar numbers in each group were admitted to hospital (55 and 69, respectively). Another study (<LINK REF="STD-Rasmussen-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Rasmussen 1988</LINK>) described 54 events in 59 participants in the mucolytic group and 66 events in 57 participants in the placebo group. <LINK REF="STD-Meister-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Meister 1999</LINK> reported 201 adverse effects in 122 participants in the mucolytic group (1.65 per participant) and 170 adverse effects in 124 participants in the placebo group (1.37 per participant). These studies could not be included in the meta-analysis because event rates exceeded numbers included in the treatment groups. <LINK REF="STD-Malerba-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Malerba 2004</LINK> also reported no greater risk of events and no greater severity of events with mucolytic treatment compared with placebo.</P>
<P>In summary, clinical studies have reported probably no difference between mucolytic and placebo treatments in terms of the total numbers of adverse effects that they cause.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Deaths</HEADING>
<P>Eight studies reported on numbers of deaths in mucolytic-treated and placebo groups, revealing no significant differences (Peto OR 1.03, 95% CI 0.52 to 2.03; <LINK REF="CMP-001.18" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.18</LINK>). As no deaths were reported in either group in <LINK REF="STD-Zheng-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Zheng 2008</LINK>, this information could not be incorporated into the meta-analysis.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-07-22 11:38:29 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">
<P>The previous update of this review was performed in 2012 (<LINK REF="REF-Poole-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Poole 2012</LINK>). Since that time, a further four studies that were eligible for inclusion have been conducted (<LINK REF="STD-De-Backer-2013" TYPE="STUDY">De Backer 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Roy-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Roy 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tse-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Tse 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zheng-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Zheng 2014</LINK>). Owing to interest in the efficacy of higher and longer doses of NAC, we have included subgroup analyses of the effects of mucolytics in studies of 12 months or longer (<LINK REF="CMP-001.08" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.8</LINK>) and the effects of N-acetylcysteine (NAC) at higher doses (1200 or 1800 mg per day; <LINK REF="CMP-001.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.5</LINK>).</P>
<P>The present update strengthens findings from our previous reviews indicating that participants given a mucolytic agent for an average of 10 months are more likely to be exacerbation-free during that time (odds ratio (OR) 1.75). For one participant to be exacerbation-free, eight need to be treated for at least 10 months. The improvement in total number of exacerbations per participant per month is, at best, 0.3, which is about one fewer exacerbation every three years. Mucolytics may be associated with a small decrease in hospitalisations. With the addition of newer studies, certainty that mucolytics do not have an effect on lung function decline, mortality or adverse effects is increasing. The impact on quality of life as measured by the total St George Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) score is smaller than the clinical minimally important difference of 4 units, but we cannot rule out a population benefit, as we do not have a responder analysis.</P>
<P>For many outcomes - primary and secondary - significant heterogeneity has been noted among studies; therefore the results do need to be interpreted with particular caution. The only outcomes for which heterogeneity among trials was not significant were days on antibiotics, forced vital capacity (FVC) and death during the study period. To explore causes of heterogeneity for the primary outcome of exacerbations, we performed subgroup analyses according to study date, baseline forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV<SUB>1</SUB>) (as % predicted), type of mucolytic, dose of mucolytic, duration of therapy, whether participants were included because they had a history of exacerbations, whether concomitant inhaled steroids were used and the country in which the study was conducted. Heterogeneity was generally less among later trials, those with winter treatment only, those with no inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) and those with NAC 1200 mg/d.</P>
<P>The tendency for participants given mucolytics to have fewer exacerbations or to be more likely to be exacerbation-free was seen in all studies except <LINK REF="STD-Schermer-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Schermer 2009</LINK>. This was the first study that found an increased number of exacerbations in the mucolytic-treated group compared with the placebo-treated group; however, this difference was not statistically significant. The exacerbation rate was generally low in this study, and data were skewed by two participants in the NAC-treated group who had very frequent exacerbations. Additionally, this study reported a high dropout rate (43%).</P>
<P>However, when we performed a post hoc investigation comparing more recent study results versus those from previous decades, we found a clear reduction in the effects of treatment in more recent studies (see <LINK REF="FIG-04" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 4</LINK>; I <SUP>2</SUP>= 93.3% between subgroups). Although all studies included in this analysis were placebo-controlled, and most were double-blind, the older studies were more difficult to judge in terms of bias (see <LINK REF="FIG-06" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 6</LINK>), and this may have led to an overestimation of treatment effect. Therefore we have a reduced level of confidence in the overall treatment effect estimate indicating that eight additional participants would need to be treated with mucolytics over 10 months to keep an additional participant free from exacerbations. We found no significant differences in adverse events or mortality (see <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>).</P>
<P>On the other hand, internal consistency is evident in the findings, in that the small effect on exacerbation rate is accompanied by a greater likelihood that patients would be exacerbation-free and that exacerbations would be less prolonged.</P>
<P>To provide some context for the interpretation of findings in this review, the ISOLDE trial, which treated participants with moderately severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with either 500 micrograms of fluticasone dipropionate twice daily for three years or placebo, showed a reduction in exacerbations with fluticasone from 1.32 per year to 0.99 per year - for an absolute reduction of 0.33 exacerbations per year, or 25% (<LINK REF="REF-Burge-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burge 2000</LINK>). In other studies, long-acting beta-agonists, long-acting muscarinic antagonists, phosphodiesterase (PDE)<SUB>4</SUB> inhibitors and azithromycin have been shown to significantly reduce exacerbation frequency.</P>
<P>Theoretical reasons have been proposed to explain why mucolytics may modify disease in ways other than by reducing exacerbations (i.e. through antioxidant and thiol donor effects). More recent studies have sought to explore whether the decline in FEV<SUB>1 </SUB>over time is changed by mucolytics. NAC has been used at higher doses or for longer durations without providing additional benefits. The reduction in exacerbation rates seen with NAC was virtually identical to that observed with other mucolytics examined as a group. The mechanisms responsible for the benefits of mucolytic treatment on exacerbation rates and days of disability cannot be identified by this review. However, lack of effect of N-isobutyrylcysteine (NIC) (a thiol donor with antioxidant properties) on exacerbation rates or days sick raises the possibility that the actions of NAC as a thiol donor are less important in the reduction of exacerbations.</P>
<P>Despite the suggestion of benefit presented by earlier studies, none of the large studies (BRONCUS study, PEACE study, COOPT, HIACE, PANTHEON) showed significant slowing of the decline in FEV<SUB>1</SUB> with mucolytic treatment. On the other hand, no evidence suggests that mucolytics are unsafe, and findings indicate that they do not adversely affect quality of life, even though medicines need to be taken at least once a day.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2015-07-29 09:18:32 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">
<P>This review has now been updated substantively six times. Over time, with a steady increase in the numbers of studies published, even though a significant treatment effect of mucolytics on exacerbations has always been observed, the size of this effect has decreased by almost 50% from that described in the original report. This trend may be observed in <LINK REF="FIG-04" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 4</LINK>, where studies have been ordered by year of publication and separated by decade of publication.</P>
<P>We have considered below two factors that may be contributing to this observation.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Improved study design, execution and reporting over the years</HEADING>
<P>Confidence intervals are narrower, and consequently greater weight is afforded to more recent studies. The forest plot in <LINK REF="FIG-04" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 4</LINK> has been arranged by date and shows this trend. Part of the explanation is that more recent studies, on average, have been larger than earlier ones. Another consideration is that publication bias may have influenced reporting of results of earlier trials. This is suggested by an asymmetrical funnel plot in <LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK> (<LINK REF="FIG-05" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 5</LINK>). We have persisted with using the more conservative fixed-effect model, which gives greater weight to recent larger studies such as <LINK REF="STD-Zheng-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Zheng 2008</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Decramer-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Decramer 2005</LINK>. If a random-effects model is used, the effect size of mucolytic therapy is larger (mean difference (MD) -0.07, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.09 to -0.05), but the degree of heterogeneity remains.</P>
<P>Furthermore, tighter definitions of COPD have been used in later studies, which have generally included patients with, at most, moderate disease. To be included in earlier studies, patients needed only to have symptoms of chronic bronchitis. Additionally, later studies have been longer so may be more robust in ascertaining mean exacerbation rates. Finally, as was mentioned previously, older studies may be at greater risk of selection bias, which may have inflated estimates of the treatment effect.</P>
<P>Recent studies have tended to be longer. <LINK REF="CMP-001.08" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.8</LINK> shows an inverse relationship between effect size and study duration. Although this may represent regression to the mean, an element of 'immortal time bias' may have been introduced, although exposure time was longer in the intervention group (through fewer dropouts) than in the placebo group (more dropouts). This would allow more exacerbations to be recorded for those remaining in the study, hence diluting any treatment effect.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Improved COPD care</HEADING>
<P>Comprehensive management of COPD includes support for smoking cessation, vaccination, pulmonary rehabilitation and use of inhaled corticosteroids, long-acting beta-agonists and anticholinergic agents (<LINK REF="REF-GOLD-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">GOLD 2015</LINK>), each of which may impact exacerbation frequency or severity.</P>
<P>Lower exacerbation rates would allow less room for improvement with mucolytics. In support of this, lower monthly exacerbation rates have been reported in the control groups of studies reported since 2000 (0.12 exacerbations per participant per month), compared with 0.28 per participant per month before 1990, and 0.36 between 1990 and 2000 (derived from <LINK REF="CMP-001.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.4</LINK>). On the other hand, no trend has been seen in the likelihood that participants in control groups would be exacerbation-free: 38% in pre-1990 studies, 52% between 1990 and 2000 and 36% since 2000 (derived from <LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>). Taken together, these findings suggest that over a third of study participants with COPD will have an exacerbation. In more recent studies, those who do exacerbate have fewer exacerbations, possibly because of improved COPD care generally. </P>
<P>Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) have been available for asthma since the late 1970s, but it is unlikely that they were used by participants with chronic bronchitis in trials before 1990. In most of the other studies, ICS treatment was allowed. Data from five studies have addressed the relative effects of mucolytics and ICS. <LINK REF="STD-Malerba-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Malerba 2004</LINK> specifically excluded those taking ICS, and <LINK REF="STD-Decramer-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Decramer 2005</LINK> reported results for the subgroup not given ICS. Based on the report of average lung function, participants in these two studies had relatively mild COPD. The weighted annual event rate in relevant placebo groups from these two studies was 1.04, revealing a 17% reduction in exacerbations with mucolytics. The effect of mucolytics among non-ICS-treated participants in these two studies showed an MD of around -0.21 exacerbations per year, or -0.02 per month compared with placebo. This is about half that seen when all mucolytic studies are combined. It is difficult to know the meaning of this observation, as the numbers are small and involve two different mucolytics - NAC and ambroxol. Moreover it is not clear from the trial reports whether these were post hoc subgroup analyses.</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Zheng-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Zheng 2008</LINK>, only 17% of participants were taking ICS (compared with 70% in <LINK REF="STD-Decramer-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Decramer 2005</LINK>), but investigators found no differences in effects of carbocysteine between those taking and those not taking concomitant ICS. They did suggest that doses of ICS would have been low in this small group of participants, making findings not necessarily at odds with those of the Decramer study. On the other hand, the <LINK REF="STD-Schermer-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Schermer 2009</LINK> study was designed to compare fluticasone, NAC and placebo. In contrast to every other study in this review, the exacerbation rate was higher (1.35 times) with NAC than with placebo, but this finding did not reach statistical significance (P value = 0.054). Investigators also found the exacerbation rate to be 1.30 times higher with fluticasone (P value = 0.095), suggesting that effect sizes were similar between NAC and fluticasone. As the result of methodological issues with this study, including high dropout rates and skewed exacerbation rates, it is difficult to be certain about this. In <LINK REF="STD-Zheng-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Zheng 2014</LINK>, 44% of participants were taking ICS. These study authors found that use of ICS was the only co-variate that affected the exacerbation rate in study participants, but they noted no interaction between ICS use and effects of mucolytics (P value = 0.27).</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2015-07-22 11:38:24 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">
<P>Although almost all of the trials included in this review were double-blind, only four studies had clearly concealed allocation (<LINK REF="STD-Decramer-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Decramer 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schermer-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Schermer 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zheng-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Zheng 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zheng-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Zheng 2014</LINK>). In combination with time trends (less optimistic results in more recent trials), the possibility of publication bias seen in the funnel plot (<LINK REF="FIG-05" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 5</LINK>), and high and unbalanced dropout rates in some of the longer trials (e.g. <LINK REF="STD-Decramer-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Decramer 2005</LINK>), this indicates that the overall risk that bias inflated these trial results is high. Thus further research is likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and is likely to change the estimate towards the null effect.</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2015-07-22 10:50:26 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">
<P>The subgroup analysis by decade of publication is post hoc for updates from 2012 onward; therefore we have not assessed the likelihood that differences between subgroups have arisen by chance. On the other hand, consistency in the findings of this review has been seen over its multiple iterations since 1997, despite the addition of new outcomes, analyses and review authors.</P>
<P>In a few analyses, we have imputed standard deviations. When this has been done, it has been done conservatively and in accordance with accepted practices. This could have narrowed the confidence intervals for individual studies, thus increasing heterogeneity. Furthermore, the approach that we used may tend to overestimate the number of exacerbations per year in both groups, as more occur during the winter months, when many of these studies were performed.</P>
<P>Despite the use of a consistent approach, slight rounding errors may have been introduced by the calculation of exacerbation rates per participant per month from study data to fit into earlier versions of RevMan that allowed only two decimal points.</P>
</POTENTIAL_BIASES>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2015-07-22 10:50:26 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">
<P>In addition to this review, two other systematic reviews of the effects of NAC in chronic bronchitis have been reported. Our results are consistent with these findings. The larger of these reviews included 11 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) (<LINK REF="REF-Stey-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stey 2000</LINK>). Overall, individuals treated with NAC were more likely to remain exacerbation-free (OR 1.56, 95% CI 1.37 to 1.77), with an NNTB of 6 (95% CI 5 to 9). Participants were more likely to report improvement in symptoms with NAC (OR 1.78, 95% CI 1.54 to 2.05) than with placebo. The second review analysed nine trials that had been included in both <LINK REF="REF-Stey-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stey 2000</LINK> and this Cochrane review and confirmed a significant effect on exacerbations (standardised mean difference (SMD) -1.37, 95% CI -1.5 to -1.25) (<LINK REF="REF-Grandjean-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grandjean 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>In a recent guideline on treatments to prevent COPD exacerbations, NAC was suggested for patients with moderate or severe COPD and a history of two or more exacerbations in the previous two years (evidence grade 2B - weak recommendation, moderate-quality evidence; <LINK REF="REF-Criner-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Criner 2015</LINK>). Furthermore, carbocysteine was suggested (ungraded consensus-based statement) for patients still having exacerbations in spite of maximal therapy provided to reduce exacerbations. The most recent version of global COPD guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-GOLD-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">GOLD 2015</LINK>) states that NAC may have a role in the treatment of patients with recurrent exacerbations (evidence grade B - moderate-quality evidence), and carbocysteine or NAC may reduce exacerbations in patients not taking inhaled steroids (grade B).</P>
<P>Our findings suggest that the addition of a mucolytic may have a small beneficial effect on both the likelihood of any exacerbation and the total number of exacerbations. Differences among mucolytic agents, or among those with greater doses, have not been found, although this would need to be tested in head-to-head comparisons.</P>
<P>The analyses in this review suggest that mucolytics might, in addition, have an effect on duration and severity of exacerbations that do occur, and on the likelihood of taking antibiotics. Data from four studies suggest that mucolytics are associated with decreased hospitalisation rates. It would be helpful if future studies looked at this outcome, as this is where most costs associated with more severe disease are incurred. Few other pharmacological treatments have been shown to reduce hospitalisation: An immunomodulatory agent OM-85 BV, or Broncho-Vaxom (<LINK REF="REF-Collet-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Collet 1997</LINK>), was shown to reduce the number of hospital admissions in COPD, even though it did not affect the number of exacerbations.</P>
<P>Researchers (<LINK REF="REF-Grandjean-2000a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grandjean 2000a</LINK>) performed a retrospective cost-effectiveness analysis of NAC in chronic bronchitis that was based on direct costs of NAC treatment, management of an acute exacerbation and indirect costs of sick leave. Results suggested that costs of treatment and non-treatment were equal at the point of a reduction of 0.6 exacerbations per six-month period. In our review, a reduction of about 0.18 per six-month period suggested that it would not be cost-effective to treat everyone with COPD with mucolytics.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Bachh-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Bachh 2007</LINK> and colleagues from India estimated the cost of prophylactic NAC therapy to be INR 6000 (USD 120), whereas a short course of oral steroids and antibiotics would cost INR 200 (USD 4). ICS are also expensive. As the burden of COPD over coming decades is going to disproportionately affect developing nations, the relative costs of each strategy are important to determine.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2015-07-22 10:50:26 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">
<P>Mucolytics may reduce the number of exacerbations in people with chronic bronchitis or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) by a small amount, but do not appear to cause any harm. The reduction is at most one fewer exacerbation every three years. One person in eight may avoid having an exacerbation, provided all take treatment every day for an average of 10 months. Mucolytics have not been shown to slow the decline in lung function, and it is uncertain whether they improve quality of life or hospitalisations. As reduction in exacerbations seems the main potential benefit, mucolytics might be considered (1) a treatment option for patients with frequent exacerbations who cannot take other therapies such as inhaled corticosteroids or long-acting bronchodilators, which have a stronger evidence base for their effectiveness; or (2) add-on treatment once all other therapies to reduce exacerbations have been utilised,</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2015-07-22 10:50:26 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">
<P>Future studies might address the value of mucolytic therapy:</P>
<UL>
<LI>in patients who have multiple exacerbations per year, or who have prolonged or severe exacerbations; and</LI>
<LI>in patients with repeated admissions to hospital with exacerbations of COPD despite maximal therapy to reduce acute exacerbations of COPD.</LI>
</UL>
<P>Studies should stratify participants by (1) the new GOLD criteria (A-D; <LINK REF="REF-GOLD-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">GOLD 2015</LINK>), which incorporate symptoms and exacerbations, as well as spirometry; (2) use of concomitant medications (such as ICS, long-acting bronchodilators or macrolide antibiotics).</P>
<P>Outcomes of studies should include hospitalisations (COPD and all-cause), mortality (COPD and all-cause), numbers of days sick with exacerbations and a validated measure of quality of life. A responder analysis for quality of life would add valuable information on the population effects of treatment.</P>

I wonder if Zheng used adjusted data or the number of participants measured was less than the total recruited. I have checked the paper and find that 305 and 311 completed the study in each group so I have amended the totals to reflect this and the P value is still 0.003! What should we do?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What strikes me is the HUGE difference in the symptoms domain between Zheng and De Cramer.

<P>We screened approximately 400 abstracts of papers identified by computer searches. After excluding studies that were clearly ineligible based on the abstract, we obtained the full text for 72 papers. 21 studies involved double-blind, placebo-controlled treatment with an oral mucolytic for at least 8 weeks. 3 were excluded because they did not provide information on the primary outcome (<LINK REF="STD-Edwards-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Edwards 1976</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Maesen-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Maesen 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rubin-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Rubin 1996</LINK>).

<P>In 2011, 64 abstracts and papers were identified by the searches.

Of 7 full texts reviewed, 4 proved eligible: 2 related to the same study of cineole in COPD (Worth and Worth); another to a further study of cineole (Wilhelmi); one was a further post hoc analysis of EQUALIFE (Ballabio 2008a). One study (Lukas) of NAC in CB was excluded, as no data were available on outcomes in this review</P>
<P>Furthermore, we were informed about studies of neltenexine, which is a mucolytic, and we considered the full texts of these, which were ineligible. Thus data from 2 new studies were added for the 2012 update</P>

<P/>
<P>In 2011 the above search was run from 2008 to the present date, but with the addition of the term "cineole". We were notified about eligible studies of "neltenexine." This term should be included in the next search</P>

<P>A search in July 2014 using the terms below yielded 29 new references. (The full search strategy used in this update is provided in <LINK REF="APP-03" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 3</LINK>.)</P>
<P/>
<P>Full texts of studies that were possibly eligible were retrieved. The Moretti trial mentioned above was ineligible. Several studies had duplicate reports. A search was made of the bibliographies of eligible studies, as well as of online clinical trials. A duplicate paper on a trial already identified was found during a search for study author details. From these searches, 4 new eligible trials were identified for inclusion in this review (<LINK REF="STD-De-Backer-2013" TYPE="STUDY">De Backer 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Roy-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Roy 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tse-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Tse 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zheng-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Zheng 2014</LINK>). We wrote to Dr De Backer to request additional information on the secondary outcomes of SGRQ and spirometry alluded to in their paper, with no response. Dr Zheng provided further information on several outcomes (<LINK REF="STD-Zheng-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Zheng 2014</LINK>)</P>
