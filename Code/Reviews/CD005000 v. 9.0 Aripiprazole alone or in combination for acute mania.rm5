<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2013-12-17 10:06:13 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anne ">
<P>Bipolar disorder is a mental disorder that is seen as periods of high mood called mania, or hypomania if less severe, and periods of low mood (depression).</P>
<P>Medication is the main treatment for mania, with the first aim to decrease agitation, aggression and dangerous behaviour.</P>
<P>Antipsychotics and other antimanic medicines are included in guidelines for treating mania. This review considers the antipsychotic, aripiprazole, and assesses how effective it is in the treatment of acute mania. It also examines the side effects of aripiprazole and discusses whether people find aripiprazole to be an acceptable treatment for themselves.</P>
<P>Ten studies are included (3340 participants). Most studies compared aripiprazole versus placebo, but some researchers compared aripiprazole versus haloperidol (two studies) and versus lithium (one study). Two studies examined the effect of adding aripiprazole to another treatment (valproate or lithium) and compared this combination versus placebo combined with these other treatments. We assessed the overall risk of bias in the ten studies as unclear.</P>
<P>The main measure of effect was the mean change on the Young Mania Rating Scale from the start to the end of the trial; this tool is used by clinicians to assess the severity of mania. After three weeks of treatment, aripiprazole was better than placebo at reducing the severity of mania when used on its own or when added to other mood stabilisers. The effect was modest. However, aripiprazole caused more inner restlessness (akathisia), nausea, and constipation than placebo. Aripiprazole was similarly effective in reducing the symptoms of mania when compared with other drug treatments (haloperidol and lithium). Aripiprazole caused fewer movement disorders and less raised prolactin (a hormone secreted by the pituitary gland) than haloperidol. People taking aripiprazole were more likely to remain on treatment than those taking haloperidol but were no more or less likely than those taking placebo or lithium. The main reason for the difference in dropouts between aripiprazole and haloperidol groups was the adverse effects associated with haloperidol.</P>
<P>In summary, aripiprazole is an effective treatment for mania when compared with placebo. This finding is based on studies that included mixed populations (i.e. children, adolescents and adults). For the adult population, studies have directly compared aripiprazole versus haloperidol, lithium and placebo, but evidence obtained for treatment of the child and adolescent population is available only from placebo-controlled studies. Given the lack of evidence obtained by comparing aripiprazole versus other drugs, its exact place in therapy is unclear. Further studies focused on particular populations are needed to determine whether this treatment is equally effective in different age groups.</P>

<P>Ten studies (3340 participants) were included in the review. Seven studies compared aripiprazole monotherapy versus placebo (2239 participants); two of these included a third comparison arm&#8212;one study used lithium (485 participants) and the other used haloperidol (480 participants). Two studies compared aripiprazole as an adjunctive treatment to valproate or lithium versus placebo as an adjunctive treatment (754 participants), and one study compared aripiprazole versus haloperidol (347 participants). The overall risk of bias was unclear. A high dropout rate from most trials (&gt; 20% for each intervention in eight of the trials) may have affected the estimates of relative efficacy. Evidence shows that aripiprazole was more effective than placebo in reducing manic symptoms in adults and children/adolescents at three and four weeks but not at six weeks (Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS); mean difference (MD) at three weeks (random effects) -3.66, 95% confidence interval (CI) -5.82 to -2.05; six studies; N = 1819, moderate quality evidence) - a modest difference. Aripiprazole was compared with other drug treatments in three studies in adults&#8212;lithium was used in one study and haloperidol in two studies. No statistically significant differences between aripiprazole and other drug treatments in reducing manic symptoms were noted at three weeks (YMRS MD at three weeks (random effects) 0.07, 95% CI -1.24 to 1.37; three studies; N = 972, moderate quality evidence) or at any other time point up to and including 12 weeks. Compared with placebo, aripiprazole caused more movement disorders, as measured on the Simpson Angus Scale (SAS), on the Barnes Akathisia Scale (BAS) and by participant-reported akathisia (high quality evidence), with more people requiring treatment with anticholinergic medication (risk ratios (random effects) 3.28, 95% CI 1.82 to 5.91; two studies; N = 730, high quality evidence). Aripiprazole also led to more gastrointestinal disturbances (nausea (high quality evidence), and constipation) and caused more children/adolescents to have a prolactin level that fell below the lower limit of normal. Significant heterogeneity was present in the meta-analysis of movement disorders associated with aripiprazole and other treatments and was most likely due to the different side effect profiles of lithium and haloperidol. At the three-week time point, meta-analysis was not possible because of lack of data; however, at 12 weeks, haloperidol resulted in significantly more movement disorders than aripiprazole, as measured on the SAS, the BAS and the Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS) and by participant-reported akathisia. By 12 weeks, investigators reported no difference between aripiprazole and lithium (SAS, BAS, AIMS), except in terms of participant-reported akathisia (RR 2.97, 95% CI 1.37 to 6.43; one study; N = 313).</P>

<P>Aripiprazole is an effective treatment for mania in a population that includes adults, children and adolescents, although its use leads to gastrointestinal disturbances and movement disorders.

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2013-12-12 22:24:10 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anne ">
<P>Bipolar disorder is a mental disorder characterised by episodes of elevated or irritable mood (manic or hypomanic episodes) and episodes of low mood and loss of energy (depressive episodes). Depressive and manic symptoms may occur at the same time in some people (mixed episode). Bipolar disorder can be divided into different forms, including bipolar I disorder and bipolar II disorder. Bipolar I disorder is characterised by manic and depressive episodes, and bipolar II disorder by hypomanic and depressive episodes. Psychotic symptoms, such as delusions or hallucinations, can occur in mania and often are considered a severity measure rather than evidence of a comorbid psychotic disorder. Some authorities do not accept this position, and arguably non&#8211;mood congruent psychotic symptoms should be examined separately, although they occur in a minority of patients (<LINK REF="REF-EMEA-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">EMEA 2001</LINK>). Those people who meet the diagnostic criteria for bipolar disorder and schizophrenia at the same time are given a diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder.</P>
<P>The lifetime prevalence of mania in the general population is approximately 1% (<LINK REF="REF-Waraich-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Waraich 2004</LINK>). The costs of manic episodes are high both for patients and for health services. For patients, in addition to the period of acute illness, manic episodes often leave an aftermath of psychological, social and financial problems (<LINK REF="REF-APA-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">APA 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-de-Zelicourt-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">de Zelicourt 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Olie-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Olie 2002</LINK>). Direct medical costs are high because admission to a psychiatric unit is often necessary.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2013-12-12 22:48:40 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The overall objective when treating patients with acute mania is to control symptoms such that psychosocial functioning returns to normal; the initial aim is to achieve rapid control of agitation, aggression and dangerous behaviour. Drug treatment is the first-line treatment for acute mania. Several different drugs are used as monotherapy or in combination. Antipsychotics have been used for many years, particularly when mania is accompanied by psychosis. Evidence-based guidelines for the treatment of bipolar disorder provided by the British Association for Psychopharmacology (BAP) recommend that for severe manic or mixed episodes, an oral antipsychotic or valproate should be initiated because of its rapid antimanic effect, and that atypical antipsychotics should be considered because of "their generally more favourable short term adverse effect profile, especially in relation to motor side effects and the evidence of their efficacy as anti-manic agents" (<LINK REF="REF-Goodwin-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goodwin 2009</LINK>). When symptoms are inadequately controlled with an optimised dose of a first-line agent and/or mania is very severe, combination treatment is recommended, such as that provided when lithium or valproate is combined with an antipsychotic. Atypical antipsychotics are similarly recommended as appropriate first-line treatment by several other recent guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-Nivoli-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nivoli 2012</LINK>).</P>
<P>All antimanic drug treatments are potentially associated with adverse effects. The adverse effect profiles of these agents differ, and this is an important factor for the clinician to consider when selecting acute treatment, in particular when assessing the acceptability of long-term treatment. Antipsychotic medications, also sometimes known as neuroleptics or major tranquillisers, are associated with a wide range of potential adverse effects. These include extrapyramidal side effects (EPS) (parkinsonian tremor, dystonia, akathisia and tardive dyskinesia), cardiovascular problems (hypotension, tachycardia, arrhythmias and other electrocardiographic (ECG) changes), anticholinergic effects (dry mouth, blurred vision), endocrine changes, including elevations in serum prolactin levels (which can lead to sexual dysfunction, gynaecomastia, hypogonadism and amenorrhoea) and abnormalities of lipid and glucose metabolism. Rare, but potentially life-threatening, effects include neutropenia and neuroleptic malignant syndrome. The newer atypical antipsychotics are associated with reduced frequency of EPS, although their use may lead to increased weight gain and additional metabolic complications (<LINK REF="REF-Geddes-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Geddes 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>Lithium has several common adverse effects, including tremor, thirst and weight gain. Other, less frequently occurring, adverse effects include hypothyroidism, hypercalcaemia and other electrolyte disturbances (<LINK REF="REF-Dunner-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dunner 2000</LINK>). Lithium has a narrow therapeutic index (<LINK REF="REF-Keck-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Keck 2002</LINK>), which means that it has the potential to produce toxicity at doses not much greater than those required for a therapeutic effect, making regular plasma lithium level monitoring necessary.</P>
<P>Valproate is associated with adverse effects, including gastrointestinal disturbances, tremor, sedation and weight gain and, less commonly, with platelet disorders, pancreatitis and liver toxicity (<LINK REF="REF-APA-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">APA 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Perucca-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Perucca 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>The risk of depression following mania is widely acknowledged. It has been suggested that this risk may be increased by the use of antipsychotics (<LINK REF="REF-Segal-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Segal 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Yatham-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yatham 2002</LINK>), but it is also a component of the natural history of the disorder. Indeed effective treatment of mania rather than the antipsychotic may be the cause of a subsequent depressive phase. In practice, these possible mechanisms are difficult to disentangle, and it has not yet been established whether any drugs used in the treatment of mania increase the likelihood of depression.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2013-12-12 22:50:34 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>It has been proposed that dopamine abnormalities are involved in the hyperactivity associated with severe stages of mania (<LINK REF="REF-Manji-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Manji 2000</LINK>). Aripiprazole is an antipsychotic drug that is a partial agonist at D<SUB>2</SUB> receptors (<LINK REF="REF-Taylor-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Taylor 2003</LINK>). The intrinsic activity of aripiprazole at D<SUB>2</SUB> receptors is less than the activity of endogenous dopamine, so in the presence of an excess of endogenous dopamine, aripiprazole acts as an antagonist (<LINK REF="REF-Argo-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Argo 2004</LINK>). Because of its intrinsic properties, when all D<SUB>2</SUB> receptors are occupied by aripiprazole, the effect is about a 30% reduction in receptor-mediated activity (<LINK REF="REF-Taylor-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Taylor 2003</LINK>). In low dopamine states, aripiprazole has been shown to act as an agonist, causing increases in dopaminergic transmission (<LINK REF="REF-Grunder-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grunder 2003</LINK>). Aripiprazole is also a potent antagonist at 5HT<SUB>2A </SUB>and is a partial agonist at 5HT<SUB>1A</SUB> receptors (<LINK REF="REF-Jordan-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jordan 2002</LINK>), which may offer protection against EPS (<LINK REF="REF-Taylor-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Taylor 2003</LINK>). All other currently available antipsychotics are antagonists at dopamine D<SUB>2</SUB> receptors. Occupancy of typical antipsychotic drugs at striatal D<SUB>2</SUB> receptors of between 60% and 80% has been suggested as the optimum for treatment response, with occupancy above 80% associated with EPS. The same is true for most of the atypical antipsychotics (<LINK REF="REF-Grunder-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grunder 2003</LINK>). In contrast to other antipsychotics, clinically effective doses of aripiprazole occupy about 80% to 95% of striatal dopamine D<SUB>2</SUB> receptors (<LINK REF="REF-Grunder-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grunder 2003</LINK>), but at these levels of occupancy, the incidence of EPS is no greater than with placebo (<LINK REF="REF-Grunder-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grunder 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Taylor-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Taylor 2003</LINK>). It has been suggested that aripiprazole has a favourable side effect profile. Rates of EPS were similar to those seen with placebo (<LINK REF="REF-Marder-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marder 2003</LINK>). It has also been shown that aripiprazole is not associated with hyperprolactinaemia (<LINK REF="REF-Carson-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carson 2002</LINK>) or QTc prolongation (<LINK REF="REF-Stock-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stock 2002</LINK>). However, it has been associated with minimal weight increases similar to those seen with haloperidol (<LINK REF="REF-Jody-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jody 2002</LINK>) and may be associated in the short term with nausea, vomiting, dyspepsia, insomnia, somnolence, constipation, headache and akathisia (<LINK REF="REF-Taylor-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Taylor 2003</LINK>).</P>

<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2013-12-12 22:56:30 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The BAP guidelines report that, in monotherapy placebo-controlled trials, the atypical antipsychotics, including aripiprazole, have been shown to be effective in the treatment of acute manic or mixed episodes (<LINK REF="REF-Goodwin-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goodwin 2009</LINK>). A systematic review of 13 randomised placebo-controlled trials (including two of aripiprazole) concluded that antipsychotics and mood stabilisers are significantly more effective than placebo in treating acute mania (<LINK REF="REF-Smith-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smith 2007</LINK>). Two recent reviews of aripiprazole in bipolar disorder concluded that aripiprazole is clinically effective in managing acute mania and in preventing relapse (<LINK REF="REF-De-Fazio-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">De Fazio 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fountoulakis-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fountoulakis 2009</LINK>). A recent meta-analysis (<LINK REF="REF-Fountoulakis-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fountoulakis 2011</LINK>) of aripiprazole monotherapy that included data from six trials supports the usefulness of aripiprazole, although the effect sizes reported were not impressive, and the meta-analysis was not performed in accordance with the methodology of <I>The Cochrane Library</I>.</P>
<P>This systematic review assesses evidence obtained for the efficacy and tolerability of aripiprazole, given alone or in combination with other antimanic drug treatments, compared with placebo and other drug treatments (excluding treatments included in separate reviews of mood stabilisers), in the treatment of acute manic or mixed episodes.

<B>CCDAN's Specialized Register (CCDANCTR)</B>
</P>
<P>The Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Group (CCDAN) maintains two clinical trial registers at its editorial base in Bristol, UK: a references register and a studies-based register. The CCDANCTR-References Register contains over 33,000 reports of randomised controlled trials in depression, anxiety and neurosis. Approximately 65% of these references have been tagged to individual, coded trials. The coded trials are held in the CCDANCTR-Studies Register, and records are linked between the two registers through the use of unique Study ID tags. Coding of trials is based on the <I>EU-Psi Coding Manual</I>. Please contact the CCDAN Trials Search Co-ordinator for further details. Reports of trials for inclusion in the Group's registers are collated from routine (weekly), generic searches of MEDLINE (1950 to date), EMBASE (1970 to date) and PsycINFO (1960 to date); quarterly searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); and review-specific searches of additional databases. Reports of trials are also sourced from international trials registers (<A HREF="http://apps.who.int/trialsearch/">ICTRP</A>), <A HREF="http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/">ClinicalTrials.gov</A>, drug companies, the handsearching of key journals, conference proceedings and other (non-Cochrane) systematic reviews and meta-analyses.

At the end of week two, treatment could be continued on an outpatient basis provided that the Clinical Global Impression-Bipolar Disorder (CGI-BP) severity (mania) score was &#8804; 3 and the CGI-BP improvement (mania) score was &#8804; 2.

<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Zimbroff-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Zimbroff 2007</LINK>, a study comparing intramuscular aripiprazole with placebo in participants with bipolar disorder, was excluded because the indication for treatment was immediate relief of acute agitation (rapid tranquillisation).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-CN138189" TYPE="STUDY">CN138189</LINK>, a relapse prevention study, included three phases: phase one consisted of two weeks of treatment with lithium or valproate, phase two was a single-blind phase during which aripiprazole was added to lithium or valproate for participants who had confirmed partial non-response and phase three was the double-blind portion, during which those who had maintained response for 12 weeks during phase two were randomly assigned to continue with aripiprazole and the mood stabiliser or to switch to placebo and the mood stabiliser for 52 weeks. The reason for exclusion was that data from phase two of the study could not be used as the trial did not include a comparison arm.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-NCT00484471" TYPE="STUDY">NCT00484471</LINK>, a relapse prevention study, included a five- to six-week aripiprazole plus valproate acute treatment phase, which was open-label. This was followed by a 22-week double-blind phase, during which participants were randomly assigned to receive placebo plus valproate or to continue with aripiprazole plus valproate. The trial was excluded because it was not possible to use data from the acute phase, as it included no comparison arm and was open-label.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Woo-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Woo 2011</LINK>, a relapse prevention study, included a six-week aripiprazole plus valproate acute treatment phase, which was open-label. This was followed by a 24-week double-blind phase, during which participants were randomly assigned to receive placebo plus valproate or to continue with aripiprazole plus valproate. The trial was excluded because it was not possible to use data from the acute phase, as it included no comparison arm and was open-label.</P>
<P>Limited details are provided in the report of <LINK REF="STD-NCT00606229" TYPE="STUDY">NCT00606229</LINK>. The study investigated the safety and efficacy of aripiprazole in combination with a mood stabiliser (lithium or valproate) over 24 weeks in participants with bipolar disorder who were experiencing a manic or mixed episode. As the entire study was open-label, it was excluded from the meta-analysis.</P>
<P>Intramuscular depot aripiprazole is used in <LINK REF="STD-NCT01567527" TYPE="STUDY">NCT01567527</LINK>, a relapse prevention study in patients experiencing a manic episode. The study included four treatment phases: a conversion to oral aripiprazole monotherapy phase, an oral aripiprazole stabilisation phase, a single-blind aripiprazole intramuscular depot stabilisation phase and a double-blind placebo-controlled maintenance phase lasting 52 weeks. The acute phases of treatment were open-label or single-blind; therefore, data from this study were not included in the meta-analysis.</P>
<P>A cross-over study of methylphenidate combined with aripiprazole in children and adolescents with bipolar disorder and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (<LINK REF="STD-Zeni-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Zeni 2009</LINK>) was excluded, as participants had to have been already stable on aripiprazole (from two previous studies).

<P>A synoptic clinical study report (<LINK REF="STD-CN138077" TYPE="STUDY">CN138077</LINK>), available on the Bristol-Myers Squibb website, describes a study that appears to meet our inclusion criteria. However, Bristol-Myers Squibb discontinued enrolment and closed the study early, citing that sufficient data were already available from other studies to support the safety and efficacy of aripiprazole in the treatment of acute mania. A sample size of 250 was planned, and the study was discontinued after randomisation of only 56 participants. Further details and data were requested from Bristol-Myers Squibb but were not supplied. It is not clear whether any usable data were reported. Therefore, we were not able to include this study in our meta-analysis.</P>

<P>The main analyses that help to answer our review question of whether aripiprazole is an effective and safe treatment for mania are change in manic symptoms on YMRS, response, remission, acceptability of treatment and emergence of side effects such as EPS, cardiac complications and metabolic side effects.

<P>With the exception of one study, which used response as the primary outcome (<LINK REF="STD-Vieta-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Vieta 2005</LINK>), all other trials report, defined a priori, the mean change in YMRS total score from baseline to endpoint as the primary outcome measure. On this measure, using random-effects analysis, evidence shows that aripiprazole was more efficacious than placebo at the end of week three; however, the difference was relatively modest (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1;</LINK> <LINK REF="FIG-04" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 4:</LINK> six studies, N = 1819; random-effects mean difference (MD) -3.66, 95% confidence interval (CI) -5.28 to -2.05; P &lt; 0.00001; Tau<SUP>2 </SUP>= 3.20, Chi<SUP>2</SUP> for heterogeneity = 17.57, df = 7 (P = 0.01), I<SUP>2</SUP> = 60%).

The difference in study design (fixed vs variable dosing) may explain the significant heterogeneity that was present. However, heterogeneity was also present between the two studies that used a fixed dose of 30 mg aripiprazole (protocol <LINK REF="STD-CN138_x002d_007" TYPE="STUDY">CN138-007;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Findling-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Findling 2009</LINK>).

The study in children/adolescents in which prolactin was measured (<LINK REF="STD-Findling-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Findling 2009</LINK>) had missing data that were not accounted for. Data from any of these studies were insufficient for meta-analysis. The authors of <LINK REF="STD-Findling-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Findling 2009</LINK> reported that at the four-week endpoint, significantly more male and female adolescents receiving aripiprazole had a prolactin level that was below the lower end of the normal range, and they comment that it is important to be mindful of a potential for lowered prolactin levels in children taking aripiprazole, and that although the clinical relevance is not known, some adverse consequences may occur. This is an area that probably warrants further investigation.</P>
<P>Mean prolactin levels in the aripiprazole and placebo groups in all other studies also fell; it is reported in two of them (<LINK REF="STD-CN138_x002d_007" TYPE="STUDY">CN138-007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sachs-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Sachs 2006</LINK>) that the levels did not go below the lower end of normal.</P>

<P>Three studies compared aripiprazole versus other drug treatment. In one 12-week study, aripiprazole was compared with haloperidol (<LINK REF="STD-Vieta-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Vieta 2005</LINK>). Two other studies used placebo and active comparator arms. In one study, the active comparator was lithium (<LINK REF="STD-Keck-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Keck 2009</LINK>), and in the other, the active comparator was haloperidol (<LINK REF="STD-Young-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Young 2009</LINK>). Both of these studies were 12 weeks long; however, only the aripiprazole and active comparator arms were continued beyond week three. Comparison subcategories were set up for aripiprazole versus haloperidol and for aripiprazole versus lithium, and data at three and 12 weeks were included in the meta-analysis. Again a large number of analyses are included, and to answer our main review question of whether aripiprazole is an effective and safe treatment for mania, change in manic symptoms on the YMRS, response, remission, acceptability of treatment and emergence of side effects such as EPS, cardiac complications and metabolic side effects are considered as the primary analyses (and are marked with an *).

In the other two studies, response was a secondary outcome at 12 weeks, and it was a secondary outcome in all studies at three weeks. At three weeks, the difference in response was not significantly different between other drug treatments and aripiprazole, with very similar results obtained on fixed-effect and random-effects analyses (<LINK REF="CMP-002.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.3</LINK>: three studies, N = 990; random-effects RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.63; P = 0.54; Tau<SUP>2</SUP> = 0.08, Chi<SUP>2 </SUP>= 8.73, df = 2 (P = 0.01) I<SUP>2</SUP> = 77%; fixed-effect RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.33; P = 0.20). The presence of significant heterogeneity does not appear to be explained by the difference in drug treatments used (lithium and haloperidol), and when the two comparator drug treatments were looked at separately, no difference was noted between aripiprazole and either drug treatment: aripiprazole versus haloperidol (two studies, N = 675; random-effects RR 1.26, 95% CI 0.73 to 2.16; P = 0.41; Tau<SUP>2</SUP> = 0.13, Chi<SUP>2 </SUP>= 6.68, df = 1 (P = 0.010), I<SUP>2</SUP> = 85%) or aripiprazole versus lithium (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.25; P = 0.50).</P>

When a fixed-effect analysis was performed, a difference favouring aripiprazole only just reached statistical significance (fixed-effect RR 1.13, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.24; P = 0.01). However, the I<SUP>2 </SUP>value indicates significant heterogeneity.

It is also reported in all studies that a decrease in mean prolactin levels was noted in participants taking aripiprazole. In the lithium-controlled study (<LINK REF="STD-Keck-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Keck 2009</LINK>), a mean decrease in levels was noted in the group taking lithium; however, the decrease in the aripiprazole group was significantly greater.

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-12-17 10:06:13 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The primary measure of efficacy for this review was change in manic symptom ratings using the YMRS, and overall, evidence showed that aripiprazole was superior to placebo in reducing manic symptoms measured using this scale (mean change in YMRS from baseline at three weeks in the intervention groups was 3.66 points lower<B> </B>(5.28 to 2.05)&#8212;a modest difference; <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>) and evidence showed no difference between aripiprazole and other drug treatments (mean change in YMRS from baseline in the intervention groups was 0.07 higher<B> </B>(1.24 lower to 1.37 higher; <LINK REF="SOF-02" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 2</LINK>).</P>
<P>Aripiprazole-treated participants were also more likely than placebo-treated participants to achieve a clinical response (see <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>); however, no statistically or clinically significant differences were observed between aripiprazole and other drug treatments in terms of reduction in clinical symptoms or in the rate of response (see <LINK REF="SOF-02" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 2</LINK>). Aripiprazole-treated participants were no more likely to achieve remission than placebo-treated participants.</P>
<P>Dropout rates were high in all but two trials. Many factors can influence a person's decision to continue taking medication, including perceived efficacy and side effects, and in a patient population with bipolar disorder, compliance with medication is generally poor.</P>
<P>Overall dropout rates did not differ significantly between aripiprazole and placebo (see numbers completing treatment in <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>), although exploratory analysis suggests that adverse effects resulted in more dropouts with aripiprazole, and that lack of efficacy resulted in more dropouts with placebo. No significant difference in dropout rates or in reasons for dropping out was observed between aripiprazole and other drug treatments (haloperidol and lithium) (see numbers completing treatment in <LINK REF="SOF-02" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 2</LINK>), although significant heterogeneity was noted in these results, which did not appear to be fully explained by the differences in comparative treatments used.<BR/>
<BR/>Exploratory analyses were also performed as part of the review. When other scales such as the CGI-BP were analysed, aripiprazole appeared superior to placebo. Exploratory analysis of the data for depressive symptoms suggested that aripiprazole was not statistically significantly better than placebo at reducing depressive symptoms. Also, no significant difference between aripiprazole and other drug treatments was observed in the change in CGI-BP depressive scale scores and MADRS scores. However, as depressive symptoms were not particularly prominent at baseline in any of the studies, further research is needed to explore the effect of aripiprazole on depressive symptoms in patients with bipolar disorder.</P>
<P>Further exploratory analysis provides evidence to suggest that aripiprazole was superior to placebo in reducing psychotic symptoms, but no statistically significant differences were reported between aripiprazole and any other drug treatments for psychotic symptom reduction. Lack of meta-analysable data makes this finding preliminary.</P>
<P>No significant difference between aripiprazole and placebo was seen in the numbers of participants requiring treatment with benzodiazepines. However, as no details indicated which individuals in each group required this treatment, it is difficult to further interpret this finding. Meta-analysis of aripiprazole compared with other drug treatments on this measure was not possible.</P>
<P>The requirement for anticholinergics was included in the summary of findings tables as an indication of the propensity for aripiprazole and comparison treatments to cause extrapyramidal side effects. Aripiprazole was associated with a greater requirement to use anticholinergics, suggesting that more aripiprazole-treated participants than placebo-treated participants experienced these side effects (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>); however, this finding was based on meta-analysis of data from only two studies because other studies lacked usable data. No usable data were obtained from the studies comparing aripiprazole with other drug treatments (<LINK REF="SOF-02" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 2</LINK>).</P>
<P>The greater need to use anticholinergic medication was confirmed by evidence that aripiprazole was associated with a higher incidence of movement disorders than placebo, as measured on the SAS scale, on the BARS scale and by participant-reported akathisia. Significant heterogeneity was present in the meta-analysis of movement disorders with aripiprazole and other drug treatments; this is most likely a result of the different side effect profiles of lithium and haloperidol. Aripiprazole was more likely to cause movement disorders than lithium earlier in treatment, as measured on SAS and BARS scales, but later on (by week 12), no difference on any measure was apparent. Haloperidol was more likely to cause movement disorders than aripiprazole on all measures apart from tremor.</P>
<P>Aripiprazole was not significantly different from placebo in causing significant weight gain in adults (&#8805; 7% increase in body weight) or change from a normal to an abnormal BMI (&gt; 95th percentile) in adolescents. No significant differences in cardiovascular adverse effects were seen between aripiprazole and placebo, and very limited data suggest no significant differences in ECG results between aripiprazole and other drug treatments. Treatment-emergent depression was examined in only one study; this suggests that aripiprazole might be associated with a greater incidence of depression than placebo, and post hoc analysis in one study revealed no difference between aripiprazole and haloperidol on this measure; however, this is an area for further research. No treatment was associated with significantly more sedation than any other, but aripiprazole was more likely to cause insomnia than haloperidol. Gastrointestinal disturbance, including nausea, dyspepsia and constipation, was more of a problem with aripiprazole than with placebo; however, limited evidence suggests that these problems may be short-lived. A lower incidence of raised prolactin with aripiprazole than with haloperidol is reported by authors of these studies, who indicate that mean prolactin levels fall with aripiprazole and increase with haloperidol. However, as insufficient data meant that meta-analysis was not possible, these findings need further confirmation. In the child/adolescent population, study authors reported that aripiprazole caused more prolactin levels to fall below the lower limit of normal (in both males and females). The long-term consequences of this effect have not been investigated, but it is suggested that low levels could be associated with adverse outcomes (<LINK REF="STD-Findling-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Findling 2009</LINK>). This area warrants further research.</P>
<P>No details were reported in these trials regarding the severity of side effects reported or time to onset or resolution, with the exception of one trial, which further analysed gastrointestinal adverse effects and reported that they usually occurred in the first week and resolved within seven days.</P>
<P>Aripiprazole was superior to placebo in reducing overall severity of psychiatric symptoms, but it was not different from other drug treatments. Most studies did not investigate general health, social functioning or quality of life. However, one study measured quality of life but provided no usable data, and another study measured functioning by using two separate functioning assessment scales, both of which revealed no differences between aripiprazole and placebo.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2013-12-13 05:19:30 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anne ">
<P>The overall aim of the review was to assess the efficacy and tolerability of aripiprazole, alone or in combination with other antimanic drug treatments, compared with placebo and other drug treatments in the treatment of acute manic or mixed episodes. Most studies were carried out in an adult population, with a fairly equal split between male and female participants, who were primarily inpatients, but some outpatients were included. Standard diagnostic criteria were used, and most studies employed a placebo comparison. Supporting evidence is sufficient to show that aripiprazole is an effective treatment for mania, but as it was compared only with haloperidol and lithium in the adult population, and as no active comparison was made in the child/adolescent population, the evidence does not lead us to determine the place of aripiprazole in current therapy. Further comparative work is needed to address this question. Relatively limited evidence is available in the child/adolescent population, and the unanswered question remains regarding the potential consequences of lowering prolactin levels in this age group. Significant heterogeneity was present in many of the analyses, and for future updates of this review, it may be appropriate to analyse the data differently, in particular, to consider setting up additional comparisons, so that aripiprazole can be compared against different classes of antimanic agents separately rather than by combining them together.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2013-12-17 10:06:13 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anne ">
<P>Results from 10 trials (3340 participants) were included in the review; two of these were trials in children/adolescents. Only one was an independently conducted study, and nine trials were conducted by the manufacturer of aripiprazole. This is a potential limitation, and data should therefore be interpreted cautiously. Overall, no trial report provided adequate information to allow a proper assessment of trial quality.</P>
<P>The overall risk of bias was assigned as "unclear", mainly specific details were lacking in the published reports (e.g. simply stating that the trial was randomised but providing no other information). In the summary of findings tables, risk of bias was not additionally marked down, as trials had well-balanced baseline characteristics, and it was believed that marking down would not provide a fair reflection of the overall grade of the evidence.</P>
<P>In view of the low number of studies and wide confidence intervals for results from outcomes relevant to the comparison between aripiprazole and other drugs, we downgraded the quality of evidence for all the outcomes in <LINK REF="SOF-02" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 2</LINK> due to imprecision.</P>
<P>Statistical heterogeneity was observed between studies on a number of comparisons. Explanations for this heterogeneity may include the differences in dose regimens used&#8212;variable versus fixed-dose regimens, differences in study design&#8212;monotherapy verus add-on therapy, differences in populations&#8212;adults versus children/adolescents and differences in comparison drug treatments used&#8212;lithium versus haloperidol.</P>
<P>All trials used the LOCF method. This method uses the last available data point for all subsequent missing observations after a person has dropped out of the study. Assuming that a participant gradually improves during the study means that carrying a value forward from part-way through the study will result in a conservative estimate by underestimating what value data would have had if these participants had completed the study (<LINK REF="REF-Streiner-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Streiner 2008</LINK>). LOCF is a method frequently used in clinical trials, but it introduces uncertainty about the reliability of the results. LOCF assumes that no further change will occur, and it does not take into account whether the participant was improving or deteriorating. The dropout rate was high in most of the studies included in this review. Without knowing what subsequently happened to individual participants who dropped out of these studies, it is difficult to know exactly what effect this may have had on the results.</P>
<P>We have not formally investigated sources of heterogeneity by using meta-regression as data were sparse.</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2013-12-13 05:29:42 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anne ">
<P>Robust search strategies were employed, and it is highly likely that all relevant studies were identified. Bristol-Myers Squibb and the authors of some studies supplied us with requested additional data; however, additional data were not available on all outcomes of interest, and this could have introduced some bias. It was not possible to obtain additional data for one large study (<LINK REF="STD-Kanba-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Kanba 2012</LINK>), which prevented its inclusion in the meta-analysis; however, it is hoped that it may still be possible to obtain the requested data, and this would inform an update of the review. The review included trials conducted in all age groups and analysed the findings together. This may have introduced bias; therefore, for future updates, it may be more appropriate to carry out two reviews to look at the adult population and the child/adolescent population separately. In practice, a clinician will be faced with manic patients who are already taking other mood stabilisers, as well as those who are not. As these clinical situations lead to the same question (i.e. Will aripiprazole treat the manic symptoms that my patient has?), the decision was made to combine monotherapy studies (i.e. those in which aripiprazole was compared with placebo and those in which it was compared with other treatments) with add-on studies (i.e. those comparing the addition of aripiprazole to lithium/valproate versus placebo or other treatments added to lithium/valproate) and to stratify by these groups in the analyses. It is possible that dealing with these different studies may have introduced bias, and for future updates, we may consider analysing the different studies separately. In the Results section, it was specified which analyses help to answer the review question of whether aripiprazole is an effective and safe treatment for mania; these were considered the primary analyses and were marked with an *. The inclusion of a number of other analyses (dealt with as secondary data exploration analyses) may introduce bias in the conclusions drawn from the data presented.</P>

<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2013-12-13 05:32:07 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anne ">
<P>A systematic review of 13 randomised placebo-controlled trials concluded that antipsychotics (including aripiprazole) and mood stabilisers are significantly more effective than placebo in treating acute mania (<LINK REF="REF-Smith-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smith 2007</LINK>). This systematic review included two of the studies that we have included in our review (<LINK REF="STD-Keck-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Keck 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sachs-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Sachs 2006</LINK>). A recently published meta-analysis (<LINK REF="REF-Fountoulakis-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fountoulakis 2011</LINK>) of aripiprazole monotherapy data in acute mania/mixed episodes, in acute bipolar depression and as maintenance treatment reported a moderate effect size of 0.34 for aripiprazole versus placebo against acute mania. The authors include the same six acute mania/mixed monotherapy trials in adults that we have included in our meta-analysis (<LINK REF="STD-CN138_x002d_007" TYPE="STUDY">CN138-007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Keck-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Keck 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Keck-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Keck 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sachs-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Sachs 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vieta-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Vieta 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Young-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Young 2009</LINK>). The monotherapy trials in children/adolescents (<LINK REF="STD-Findling-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Findling 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tramontina-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Tramontina 2009</LINK>) and the combination treatment study (<LINK REF="STD-Vieta-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Vieta 2008</LINK>) are not included.</P>
<P>A recently published multiple treatments meta-analysis (MTM) comparing (directly and indirectly) the efficacy and acceptability (based on the number of participants who discontinued treatment for any reason) of antimanic drugs in acute mania (<LINK REF="REF-Cipriani-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cipriani 2011</LINK>) found aripiprazole to be significantly more effective than placebo and haloperidol to be significantly more effective than aripiprazole. Haloperidol and lithium were considered less acceptable treatments based on the numbers of participants who left the study early for any reason during the first three weeks. This MTM and the reviews and analyses mentioned above are consistent with our finding that aripiprazole is an effective treatment for mania; however, our review suggests that no significant difference exists between aripiprazole and haloperidol (based on mean change in YMRS). The MTM suggests that risperidone and olanzapine are the best available options in terms of both efficacy and acceptability (based on dropouts). No direct comparisons are available with these drugs, so our review is unable to suggest a place in therapy for aripiprazole.</P>

</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2013-12-17 10:06:13 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anne ">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2013-12-17 10:06:13 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anne ">
<P>There is moderate quality evidence that aripiprazole is an effective treatment for mania compared with placebo in studies of children/adolescents and adults. There is also moderate quality evidence that indicates that aripiprazole is better than placebo in producing a clinical response but imprecise evidence that it is comparable to other drug treatments. Overall, therefore, the evidence in this review is sufficient to support aripiprazole as an option for treating manic symptoms. However its place in therapy is unclear from this review, as very few directly comparative data on efficacy or tolerability were obtained and the quality of the evidence of its effects relative to other antimanic drugs is low. Direct comparisons between other antipsychotics and mood stabilisers such as risperidone and olanzapine may help to confirm the exact place of aripiprazole in therapy.</P>
<P>Although people taking aripiprazole were no more or less likely to remain on treatment than those taking placebo or other drug treatments, differences in side effect profiles may influence treatment choice. Aripiprazole is more likely than lithium (although less likely than haloperidol) to cause movement disorders, in particular, parkinsonism and akathisia. It remains unknown how aripiprazole directly compares with antipsychotics and mood stabilisers (other than haloperidol and lithium) in terms of tolerability in the treatment of mania.</P>
<P>In the child/adolescent population, comparison studies with treatments other than placebo are lacking. In our analysis, we did not consider studies in children/adolescents separately from those in adults, and this could have introduced a source of heterogeneity. Also, the potential adverse consequences of lowering prolactin levels to below the lower limit of normal in this age group remain unstudied.</P>
<P>When initiating treatment for acute mania, clinicians are likely to be considering the requirement for longer-term treatment of the illness. Evidence for aripiprazole as a treatment for relapse prevention has not been obtained in this review.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2013-12-13 05:37:27 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Studies involving large numbers of participants in a naturalistic setting are required. Studies comparing aripiprazole with other antipsychotics and mood stabilisers should also be conducted to further our understanding about the potential place of aripiprazole in the treatment of mania. In addition, these studies should address the issue of the comparative efficacy of aripiprazole in the long-term prevention of relapse. Quality of life and functioning are highly relevant measures for both patients and clinicians, for which we require good quality data. Adverse effects of medication are a key contributing factor to poor compliance with medication; therefore, more detailed assessment of emergent side effects, including comparative side effects with other medicines, is an important requirement in future research.</P>

<P>YMRS = Young Mania Rating Scale: consists of 11 items that assess the core symptoms of mania. The severity of four items (irritability, speech (rate and amount), content and disruptive/aggressive behaviour) is graded from zero (best) to eight (worst), while the severity of the seven other items (elevated mood, increased motor activity/energy, sexual interest, sleep, language/thought disorder, appearance and insight) is graded from zero (best) to four (worst). The YMRS is the sum of all items with a possible score from 0 to 60.</P>
<P>CGI-BP = Clinical Global Impression Scale-Bipolar Version: The scale comprises three major categories rating the severity of illness, the change from preceding illness and the change from the worst phase of the illness in the domains of mania, depression and overall illness, rating on each of these domains using seven-point Likert scales.</P>
<P>CGAS = Children's Global Assessment Scale: a 100-point rating scale to assess the emotional and behavioural functioning of a child in the past three months, with one being the worst score and 100 the best.</P>
<P>CDRS-R = Children's Depression Rating Scale - Revised: a brief rating scale based on a semi-structured interview (modelled on the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression) to diagnose depression and determine its severity. Seventeen symptom areas are rated, most of them on a seven-point scale and giving a single summary score.</P>
<P>GBI = General Behaviour Inventory: a 73-item self-reported questionnaire to identify individuals at risk for serious affective disorders. The 73 clinical symptoms are rated on a four-point scale.</P>
<P>PANSS = Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale: assesses the presence of positive and negative syndromes within schizophrenia. Thirty symptoms or signs within the categories of positive, negative and general psychopathology are assessed by the clinician and graded by severity on a seven-point Likert scale from absent to extreme.</P>
<P>MADRS = Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale: a clinician-rated 10-item scale used to assess depressive symptoms, particularly change following treatment with antidepressant medication. Items are rated on a zero to six scale with a total possible score of 60 and higher scores indicating greater depressive symptoms.</P>
<P>LIFE-RIFT = Longitudinal Interval Follow-up Evaluation-Range of Impaired Function Tool: a brief assessment of functional impairment. Total score = four to 20 and is the sum of four items: work, interpersonal relations, satisfaction and recreation. A negative score indicates improvement.</P>
<P>FAST = Functional Assessment Short Test: an interview-administered instrument used to assess the main functioning problems that patients with bipolar disorder experience. The FAST consists of 24 items that assess impairment or disability in six specific areas of functioning (autonomy, occupational functioning, cognitive functioning, financial issues, interpersonal relationships and leisure time). All items are rated using a four-point scale. Global score ranges from zero to 96, with higher scores indicating higher levels of impairment.</P>
<P>PGI-I = Patient Global Impression Improvement Scale: self-administered seven-point scale with scores ranging from one (very much improved) to seven (very much worse).</P>
<P>ADHD = Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder.</P>
<P>PDD = pervasive developmental disorder.</P>
<P>PTSD = post-traumatic stress disorder.</P>
