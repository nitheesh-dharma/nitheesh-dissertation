<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2017-08-30 11:26:14 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>
<B>What is the issue?</B>
</P>
<P>Many women want to be reassured that their unborn baby is healthy. Second trimester amniocentesis performed around 16 weeks' gestation is the test most often used. A needle is inserted through the abdomen into the uterus to remove a sample of amniotic fluid. Early amniocentesis can be done before 15 weeks. With chorionic villus sampling, a needle is used to withdraw a sample of placental tissue. The needle can be inserted through the abdomen (transabdominal), or vaginally through the cervix (transcervical).</P>
<P>
<B>Why is this important?</B>
</P>
<P>It is important that tests used to indicate high-risk (screening tests), and tests used to make a diagnosis (diagnostic tests) are safe and accurate. It is also important that diagnostic tests can be done early enough to allow parents the choice of early termination of pregnancy.</P>
<P>
<B>What evidence did we find?</B>
</P>
<P>We searched for evidence on 3 March 2017; we included 16 randomised controlled trials in the review, with a total of 33,555 women. The overall risk of bias was low, with very low to high-quality evidence supporting the outcomes studied. One study of 4606 women found that a second trimester amniocentesis increased spontaneous miscarriages and pregnancy losses, but the estimate remains quite imprecise, ranging from 0 to 2%.</P>
<P>Early amniocentesis was not as safe as second trimester amniocentesis because of increased pregnancy loss and spontaneous miscarriages, and higher occurrences of anomalies, particularly deformed or clubfeet (talipes).</P>
<P>Low-quality evidence found no clear differences in pregnancy loss or spontaneous miscarriages after transabdominal chorionic villus sampling or second trimester amniocentesis. Transcervical chorionic villus sampling may increase the total risk of pregnancy loss compared with a second trimester amniocentesis, mostly because of increased spontaneous miscarriages. Healthcare staff may have found transcervical chorionic villus sampling more difficult to perform than transabdominal chorionic villus sampling, because there were more failures to obtain a sample, and more repeat testing.</P>
<P>
<B>What does this mean?</B>
</P>
<P>High-quality evidence supported second trimester amniocentesis as the procedure of first choice for testing from 15 weeks' gestation or later. When a test is required earlier than 15 weeks' gestation, low-quality to moderate-quality evidence suggested that transabdominal chorionic villus sampling could be considered the procedure of first choice, depending on the outcome of interest.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2017-08-11 19:28:12 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>During pregnancy, fetal cells suitable for genetic testing can be obtained from amniotic fluid by amniocentesis (AC), placental tissue by chorionic villus sampling (CVS), or fetal blood. A major disadvantage of second trimester amniocentesis is that the results are available relatively late in pregnancy (after 16 weeks' gestation). Earlier alternatives are chorionic villus sampling (CVS) and early amniocentesis, which can be performed in the first trimester of pregnancy.</P>

<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2017-08-11 19:28:18 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The objective of this review was to compare the safety and accuracy of all types of AC (i.e. early and late) and CVS (e.g. transabdominal, transcervical) for prenatal diagnosis.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2017-08-11 19:28:44 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (3 March 2017), <A HREF="http://clinicaltrials.gov/">ClinicalTrials.gov</A>, the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (<A HREF="http://apps.who.int/trialsearch/">ICTRP</A>; 3 March 2017), and reference lists of retrieved studies.</P>

<P>Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and risk of bias, extracted data and checked them for accuracy. The quality of the evidence was assessed using the GRADE approach.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-08-30 11:26:22 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included a total of 16 randomised studies, with a total of 33,555 women, 14 of which were deemed to be at low risk of bias. The number of women included in the trials ranged from 223 to 4606.</P>
<P>Studies were categorized into six comparisons: 1. second trimester AC versus control; 2. early versus second trimester AC; 3. CVS versus second trimester AC; 4. CVS methods; 5. Early AC versus CVS; and 6. AC with or without ultrasound.</P>
<P>One study compared second trimester AC with no AC (control) in a low risk population (women = 4606). Background pregnancy loss was around 2%. Second trimester AC compared to no testing increased total pregnancy loss by another 1%. The confidence intervals (CI) around this excess risk were relatively large (3.2% versus 2.3 %, average risk ratio (RR) 1.41, 95% CI 0.99 to 2.00; moderate-quality evidence). In the same study, spontaneous miscarriages were also higher (2.1% versus 1.3%; average RR 1.60, 95% CI 1.02 to 2.52; high-quality evidence). The number of congenital anomalies was similar in both groups (2.0% versus 2.2%, average RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.39; moderate-quality evidence).<BR/>
</P>
<P>One study (women = 4334) found that early amniocentesis was not a safe early alternative compared to second trimester amniocentesis because of increased total pregnancy losses (7.6% versus 5.9%; average RR 1.29, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.61; high-quality evidence), spontaneous miscarriages (3.6% versus 2.5%, average RR 1.41, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.98; moderate-quality evidence), and a higher incidence of congential anomalies, including talipes (4.7% versus 2.7%; average RR 1.73, 95% CI 1.26 to 2.38; high-quality evidence).</P>
<P>When pregnancy loss after CVS was compared with second trimester AC, there was a clinically significant heterogeneity in the size and direction of the effect depending on the technique used (transabdominal or transcervical), therefore, the results were not pooled. Only one study compared transabdominal CVS with second trimester AC (women = 2234). They found no clear difference between the two procedures in the total pregnancy loss (6.3% versus 7%; average RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.23, low-quality evidence), spontaneous miscarriages (3.0% versus 3.9%; average RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.49 to 1.21; low-quality evidence), and perinatal deaths (0.7% versus 0.6%; average RR 1.18, 95% CI 0.40 to 3.51; low-quality evidence). Transcervical CVS may carry a higher risk of pregnancy loss (14.5% versus 11.5%; average RR 1.40, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.81), but the results were quite heterogeneous.</P>
<P>Five studies compared transabdominal and transcervical CVS (women = 7978). There were no clear differences between the two methods in pregnancy losses (average RR 1.16, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.65; very low-quality evidence), spontaneous miscarriages (average RR 1.68, 95% CI 0.79 to 3.58; very low-quality evidence), or anomalies (average RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.41 to 1.12; low-quality evidence). We downgraded the quality of the evidence to low due to heterogeneity between studies. Transcervical CVS may be more technically demanding than transabdominal CVS, with more failures to obtain sample (2.0% versus 1.1%; average RR 1.79, 95% CI 1.13 to 2.82, moderate-quality evidence).</P>
<P>Overall, we found low-quality evidence for outcomes when early amniocentesis was compared to transabdominal CVS. Spontaneous miscarriage was the only outcome supported by moderate-quality evidence, resulting in more miscarriages after early AC compared with transabdominal CVS (2.3% versus 1.3%; average RR 1.73, 95% CI 1.15 to 2.60). There were no clear differences in pregnancy losses (average RR 1.15, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.54; low-quality evidence), or anomalies (average RR 1.14, 95% CI 0.57 to 2.30; very low-quality evidence).</P>
<P>We found one study that examined AC with or without ultrasound, which evaluated a type of ultrasound-assisted procedure that is now considered obsolete.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2017-08-13 00:34:35 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Most women wish to be reassured that their unborn baby is healthy. Inevitably, any screening programme that aims to provide such reassurance will cause anxiety while waiting for the test results. The additional problems are 'false positive' screening test results (maternal serum screening and ultrasound) and lack of therapeutic options for chromosomal abnormalities. Therefore, the aim is to select screening and diagnostic tests that are both accurate and safe, and can be done early in pregnancy to allow the choice of termination of pregnancy.</P>
<P>Ultrasound is the method of choice for detection of anatomical problems (e.g. absent kidneys, spina bifida), but provides no information on the genetic constitution of a fetus. Maternal serum screening, alone or in combination with ultrasound, is often used to identify fetuses at risk of Down syndrome, but the definitive chromosomal diagnosis can only be made from fetal cells.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2017-08-09 20:35:18 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Fetal cells suitable for genetic testing could be obtained from maternal blood or pre-implantation embryos. However, the former test is still being developed, while the latter requires in vitro fertilisation, which is often not feasible. At present, only the analysis of fetal cells from amniotic fluid, placenta (chorionic villus tissue), or fetal blood can result in an accurate prenatal diagnosis.</P>
<P>Second trimester amniocentesis, a needle puncture through the overlying skin into the uterus and amniotic cavity, followed by aspiration of amniotic fluid, is traditionally performed around 16 weeks' gestation. Observational data from the 1970s suggested that, at this gestation, relatively large amounts of amniotic fluid (up to 20 mL) could be aspirated without significant technical difficulties. This amount of amniotic fluid was needed to yield a sufficient number of viable fetal cells to minimise the risk of laboratory failure. In 1977, the MRC Canadian Study reported a rate of successful culture of only 82% if obtained before 15 weeks, compared to 94% when obtained at 16 weeks or later. Another disincentive to perform earlier sampling was a belief that aspiration of large amounts of amniotic fluid earlier in gestation would be more likely to cause neonatal orthopaedic (talipes) and respiratory complications (respiratory distress syndrome).</P>
<P>A major disadvantage of second trimester amniocentesis is that a final result is usually available only after 17 weeks' gestation. Such a long waiting period for a diagnosis can be very distressing for couples, particularly when most obstetricians are reluctant to offer a surgical termination late in pregnancy. Earlier options include chorionic villus sampling (CVS) and early amniocentesis.</P>
<P>Chorionic villus sampling was first described in China in the mid-1970s, and developed further in the Western world during the 1980s (<LINK REF="REF-China-1975" TYPE="REFERENCE">China 1975</LINK>). The procedure involves aspiration of placental tissue rather than amniotic fluid. Ultrasound guided aspiration can be performed using either percutaneous transabdominal, the transvaginal, or transcervical approach. Currently, the choice of the approach and the choice of instruments tend to be based upon the operator's personal preference (<LINK REF="REF-Alfirevic-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alfirevic 2002</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2017-08-18 15:07:33 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is an understandable desire to perform CVS as early as possible. Technically, this can be done successfully as early as six weeks' gestation. However, a few clusters of limb reduction defects have been reported following CVS, with a trend toward an increased incidence of these defects when CVS was done before nine weeks' gestation (for review of the evidence, see <LINK REF="REF-Jackson-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jackson 1993</LINK>). Subsequent, large epidemiological follow-up studies failed to confirm this association (<LINK REF="REF-Froster-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Froster 1996</LINK>), but most clinicians delay this procedure until after 10 weeks' gestation.</P>
<P>Early amniocentesis (9 to 14 weeks' gestation) was introduced in the late 1980s. Technically, it is the same as a 'late' procedure, except that less amniotic fluid is removed. Ultrasound needle guidance is considered to be an essential part of the procedure because of the relatively small target area. The presence of two separate membranes (amnion and chorion) until 15 weeks' gestation creates an additional technical difficulty. Only the amniotic (inner) sac should be aspirated, because the outer sac does not contain sufficient numbers of living fetal cells.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2017-08-09 20:42:09 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>With a development of a new non-invasive prenatal diagnostic test, such as fetal cell free DNA testing from maternal blood, and recent reports of observational studies that emphasise the 'low' risk of invasive testing, it is important to critically appraise the data from randomised controlled trials for different invasive procedures. The results will help to formulate the heath care policies and clinical decisions of the future.</P>

<P>The Register is a database containing over 23,000 reports of controlled trials in the field of pregnancy and childbirth. For full search methods used to populate Pregnancy and Childbirth&#8217;s Trials Register including the detailed search strategies for CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and CINAHL; the list of handsearched journals and conference proceedings, and the list of journals reviewed via the current awareness service, please follow this link to the editorial information about the <A HREF="http://www.mrw.interscience.wiley.com/cochrane/clabout/articles/PREG/frame.html">Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth</A> in the Cochrane Library and select the &#8216;<I> <B>Specialized Register</B> </I>&#8217; section from the options on the left side of the screen.</P>

<P>Search results are screened by two people and the full text of all relevant trial reports identified through the searching activities described above is reviewed. Based on the intervention described, each trial report is assigned a number that corresponds to a specific Pregnancy and Childbirth review topic (or topics), and is then added to the Register. The Information Specialist searches the Register for each review using this topic number rather than keywords. This results in a more specific search set which has been fully accounted for in the relevant review sections (<A HREF="https://archie.cochrane.org/sections/documents/view?version=z1707201650208564474026190088883&amp;format=REVMAN#INCLUDED_STUDIES">Included studies</A>; <A HREF="https://archie.cochrane.org/sections/documents/view?version=z1707201650208564474026190088883&amp;format=REVMAN#EXCLUDED_STUDIES">Excluded studies</A>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Assessment of the quality of the evidence in included studies</HEADING>
<P>For this update, we assessed the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach, as outlined in the <I>GRADE Handbook (</I>
<LINK REF="REF-Sch_x00fc_nemann-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schünemann 2013</LINK>). We assessed the quality of the body of evidence relating to the following essential outcomes for decision making for the main comparisons: second trimester amniocentesis compared to control, early compared to second trimester amniocentesis, transcervical compared to transabdominal CVS, and early amniocentesis compared to transabdominal CVS:</P>
<OL>
<LI>All known pregnancy losses</LI>
<LI>Spontaneous miscarriage (pregnancy loss before viability - usually before 24 weeks of pregnancy)</LI>
<LI>Sampling failure</LI>
<LI>Laboratory failure</LI>
<LI>Known false negative after birth</LI>
<LI>Delivery before 33 weeks</LI>
<LI>Anomalies (all recorded)</LI>
</OL>
<P>For the subgroup comparison transabdominal CVS compared to second trimester amniocentesis, we assessed the evidence for the above outcomes using the GRADE approach, but exchanged 'anomalies' for 'perinatal death'.</P>
<P>We used <A HREF="http://www.guidelinedevelopment.org/">GRADEpro</A> GDT to import data from Review Manager 5.3 in order to create &#8217;Summary of findings&#8217; tables (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2014</LINK>. We produced a summary of the intervention effect and a measure of quality for each of the above outcomes using the GRADE approach. The GRADE approach uses five considerations (study limitations, consistency of effect, indirectness, imprecision, and publication bias) to assess the quality of the body of evidence for each outcome. The quality of the evidence can be downgraded from 'high quality' by one level for serious (or by two levels for very serious) limitations, depending on assessments for risk of bias, serious inconsistency, indirectness of evidence, imprecision of effect estimates, or potential publication bias.</P>

<P>In future updates, if appropriate, we will include cluster-randomised trials in the analyses along with individually randomised trials. We will adjust either their sample sizes or standard errors using the methods described in the <I>Cochrane Handbook of Systematic Reviews of Interventions,</I> Section 16.3.4 or 16.3.6, using an estimate of the intracluster correlation co-efficient (ICC) derived from the trial (if possible), from a similar trial, or from a study of a similar population. If we use ICCs from other sources, we will report this, and conduct sensitivity analyses to investigate the effect of variation in the ICC. If we identify both cluster-randomised trials and individually-randomised trials, we plan to synthesise the relevant information. We will consider it reasonable to combine the results from both if there is little heterogeneity between the study designs, and the interaction between the effect of the intervention and the choice of randomisation unit is considered to be unlikely.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">(5) Early amniocentesis versus transabdominal CVS</HEADING>
<P>Four completed randomised controlled trials have been identified so far.</P>
<P>The NICHD EATA Group Trial was a large multi-centre collaborative study carried out between 1997 and 2000 in hospitals in Denmark, US, and Canada, under the auspices of the US National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, and the Centre for Evaluation and Health Technology Assessment of the Danish National Board of Health <U>(</U>
<LINK REF="STD-Philip-2004-_x0028_NICHD-EATA_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Philip 2004 (NICHD EATA)</LINK>). The trial randomised 3775 women, of the 3803 eligible women who consented to participate, from a total group of 6370 women who were screened for eligibility. Eighty-seven per cent of the women were randomised at Rigshospitalet, Denmark, 7% at 11 U.S. centres, and 6% at two Canadian centres. In the early amniocentesis group, a 22-gauge spinal needle was used, and 1 mL of amniotic fluid was aspirated for each week of pregnancy. In the CVS group, a single- (19- to 20-gauge) or double-needle technique (18- to 20-gauge) was used, with the larger 'guide' needle introduced to the margin of the chorion, followed by the sample needle passing through the guide needle into the villi. To participate in the trial, operators were required to have completed at least 25 amniocenteses and 25 transabdominal CVS, on women between 77 and 104 days of gestation. Thirty-two operators were certified to perform procedures at the 14 clinical centres. Two sampling passes were allowed. If required, a second procedure could only be performed seven days after the first attempt.<BR/>

<LINK REF="STD-Nolan-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Nolan 1981</LINK> compared ultrasound-directed taps with taps inserted without the benefit of ultrasound scans. Amniocenteses in the experimental' group were not ultrasound-guided in the true meaning of this term.

<LINK REF="STD-Tabor-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Tabor 1986</LINK> provided the best estimate of an excess pregnancy loss in low-risk women caused by amniocentesis (3.2% versus 2.3%; RR 1.41, 95% CI 0.99 to 2.00; <LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>; moderate-quality evidence), and spontaneous miscarriage (2.1% versus 1.3%; RR 1.60, 95% CI 1.02 to 2.52; <LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>; high-quality evidence). However, the confidence intervals around the estimate for pregnancy loss were relatively wide, and were compatible with no or minimal excess risk. It is important to note that 95% CI for absolute risk difference ranged from 0% to 2% for both outcomes. Spontaneous miscarriage after test (pregnancy loss in women who had the test actually performed) was not reported.</P>

<P>Compared to an early amniocentesis, mid-trimester procedure was safer; total pregnancy loss after early amniocentesis was higher (7.6% versus 5.9%; RR 1.29, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.61; <LINK REF="CMP-002.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.1</LINK>; high-quality evidence).

<P>The number of congenital anomalies was higher in the early amniocentesis group (4.7% versus 2.7%; RR 1.73, 95% CI 1.26 to 2.38, <LINK REF="CMP-002.19" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.19</LINK>; high-quality evidence). If one restricted the analysis to women who actually had early amniocentesis ('on treatment' analysis), the risk of talipes was even higher (1.3% versus 0.1%; RR 14.43, 95% CI 3.45 to 60.41; <LINK REF="CMP-002.20" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.20</LINK>).</P>
<P>Early amniocentesis required more multiple needle insertions compared with mid-trimester amniocentesis (4.7% versus 1.7%; RR 2.79, 95% CI 1.92 to 4.04; <LINK REF="CMP-002.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.6</LINK>). Early amniocentesis was also more demanding for cytogeneticists with 1.8% laboratory failures after early procedure and only 0.2% after mid-trimester amniocentesis (RR 9.76, 95% CI 3.49 to 27.26; <LINK REF="CMP-002.08" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.8</LINK>; high-quality evidence). There were three known false negative after birth cytogenetic results in the early amniocentesis group and none after mid-trimester amniocentesis (0.05% versus 0.0%; RR 3.00, 95% CI 0.12 to 73.67; <LINK REF="CMP-002.12" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.12</LINK>; moderate-quality evidence). Two reports resulted in incorrect information about sex chromosomes, and in one case, a very subtle chromosome abnormality at the terminal end of chromosome one was missed and detected postnatally (0.1% versus 0.0%; RR 5.0, 95% CI 0.24 to 104.18; <LINK REF="CMP-002.12" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.12</LINK>; moderate-quality evidence). Interestingly, a known false positive after birth rate was reported to be 3.6% for early amniocentesis and 8% for mid-trimester amniocentesis. We could not extract the actual numbers from the trial reports, so we did not show this outcome in the outcome table. It appeared that most of these known false positive after birth results were so called 'pseudomosaics', not reported to the physicians.

In the transcervical CVS group, laboratory failure occurred in 1.7% cases, compared with only 0.07% after amniocentesis; there were also more cytogenetic abnormalities confined to the placenta, and more known false positive after birth and known false negative after birth results. However, cytogenetic results presented here should be interpreted with caution. They probably underestimate the true incidence of inaccurate results in both the CVS and amniocentesis groups, because the majority of fetal losses were not karyotyped post-mortem, either because of technical difficulties or concerns about medico-legal implications. The lack of complete cytogenetic follow-up in all trials made unbiased analyses on all randomised women impossible.</P>
<P>Complications were uncommon after both procedures, and there were no reports that these were ever life-threatening. Vaginal bleeding following the procedure was more common after transcervical CVS, although there was no difference in the incidence of vaginal bleeding later in pregnancy. There was no significant difference in the amniotic fluid leakage following the procedure, and pre-labour spontaneous rupture of membranes before 28 weeks in <LINK REF="STD-MRC-1991" TYPE="STUDY">MRC 1991</LINK>, but this observation should be interpreted cautiously, because data on ruptured membranes were missing for large numbers of women. Interestingly, one participating centre reported a significant increase in ruptured membranes after transcervical CVS (<LINK REF="STD-Ammala-1993-_x0028_MRC-Finland_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Ammala 1993 (MRC Finland)</LINK>). No differential effect was detected on antenatal admission to hospital.</P>
<P>In the sub-project of the <LINK REF="STD-Canada-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Canada 1989</LINK> trial, <LINK REF="REF-Spencer-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spencer 1987</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Spencer-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spencer 1988</LINK>, and <LINK REF="REF-Robinson-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Robinson 1988</LINK> compared the psychological effects of transcervical CVS and amniocentesis. In mid-pregnancy, women allocated to amniocentesis were more anxious, and felt less attachment to their babies, although by 22 weeks, these differences seemed to disappear (data were not available in a form suitable to include in a meta-analysis). Nevertheless, at 22 weeks, there was a suggestion of a persistent differential effect manifested in a decreased desire for another child, associated with amniocentesis (7/26 in the CVS group compared with 13/25 after amniocentesis).</P>
<P>Possible links between CVS, amniocentesis, and congenital anomalies could not be fully explored because of incomplete reporting, and a relatively small number of participants. There have been several reports in the past suggesting the presence of congenital anomalies (limb deformities in particular) in infants exposed to CVS in the first trimester. The available data from included studies did not support this observation. However, it should be remembered that the relationship may be gestation-dependent. The majority of procedures were carried out after nine weeks' gestation, and therefore, did not address the possibility that CVS carried out very early in pregnancy may increase the risk of congenital abnormalities.</P>
<P>For technical difficulties in sampling, the CVS group had more sampling failure (4.8% versus 1.6%; RR 3.09, 95% CI 1.98 to 4.82; studies = one; women = 3201; <LINK REF="CMP-003.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.5</LINK>), multiple insertions (30.7% versus 6.3%; RR 4.85, 95% CI 3.92 to 6.01; studies = one; women = 2917; <LINK REF="CMP-003.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.6</LINK>), and second tests performed (6.2% versus 2.1%; RR 2.83, 95% CI 1.94 to 4.13; studies = one; women = 3201; <LINK REF="CMP-003.07" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.7</LINK>). There were no clear differences between the groups for numbers of laboratory failures (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.29 to 2.06; studies = one; women = 3201; <LINK REF="CMP-003.08" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.8</LINK>), or known false positive after birth results (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.06 to 15.80; studies = one; women = 3201; <LINK REF="CMP-003.13" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.13</LINK>).</P>
<P>Reporting time for cytogenetic analyses was analysed in weekly tranches, although we did not pre-specify these particular time intervals. The CVS group had more results given in less than seven days (15.2% versus 0.6%; RR 23.52, 95% CI 12.54 to 44.10; studies = one; women = 3099; <LINK REF="CMP-003.15" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.15</LINK>), less than 14 days (22.5% versus 5.7%; RR 3.96, 95% CI 3.17 to 4.95; studies = one; women = 3099; <LINK REF="CMP-003.16" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.16</LINK>), and fewer results given at more than 21 days (10.8% versus 32.6%; RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.39; studies = one; women = 3099; <LINK REF="CMP-003.18" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.18</LINK>).</P>
<P>For pregnancy complications, the CVS group had more deliveries at less than 37 weeks (18.3% versus 13.7%; RR 1.33, 95% CI 1.13 to 1.57; studies = one; women = 3189; <LINK REF="CMP-003.24" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.24</LINK>).</P>
<P>There were a number of outcomes with potentially clinically important differences, but the number of events was not large enough to precisely estimate the risks.

<P>Compared with transabdominal CVS, total pregnancy loss and spontaneous miscarriages were higher after transcervical CVS, but this was due to the excess loss in the transcervical arm of the <LINK REF="STD-Smidt_x002d_Jensen-1993-_x0028_Denmark_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Smidt-Jensen 1993 (Denmark)</LINK> trial. This trial reported total pregnancy loss after transcervical CVS of 12.4% compared with 7.4% after transabdominal CVS. Corresponding figures for spontaneous pregnancy loss were 8.2% and 3%. However, there was no clear difference between groups for total pregnancy loss and miscarriage rate in the other four trials (<LINK REF="STD-Bovicelli-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Bovicelli 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Brambati-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Brambati 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tomassini-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Tomassini 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jackson-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Jackson 1992</LINK>). Because of these differences, there was statistical heterogeneity for these two outcomes (I² = 72.3%). When the fixed-effect model was used to summarise the results for these two outcomes, transcervical CVS was associated with an increase in total pregnancy loss (RR 1.23, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.42) and spontaneous miscarriage (RR 1.75, 95% CI 1.33 to 2.29). However, in the presence of heterogeneity, it was prudent to apply a more conservative random-effects model. When we applied this statistical model, the differences in pregnancy loss and miscarriage between transabdominal and transcervical CVS were no longer clear (RR 1.68, 95% CI 0.79 to 3.58; <LINK REF="CMP-004.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.2</LINK> for spontaneous miscarriage, and RR 1.16, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.56; <LINK REF="CMP-004.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.1</LINK> for total pregnancy loss; very low-quality evidence).</P>
<P>There were many outcomes with potentially clinically important differences, but the number of events was not large enough to precisely estimate the risks.

<P>Transcervical CVS was more likely to fail, although there was a disproportionate contribution of the data from <LINK REF="STD-Jackson-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Jackson 1992</LINK> (weight 91%).

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-08-11 18:37:09 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The only estimate from randomised trials of an 'excess' risk after second trimester amniocentesis came from <LINK REF="STD-Tabor-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Tabor 1986</LINK>. In a low-risk population with a background pregnancy loss of around 2%, a mid-trimester amniocentesis increased this risk by another 1%. It is important to stress that the estimate is relatively imprecise, with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for absolute risk difference ranging from 0% to 2%.</P>
<P>Women who request early diagnostic procedures (e.g. because of religious or personal prohibitions on later pregnancy termination, or because of a very high risk of fetal abnormalities) should be counselled about the relative risks of the various options. There is now enough moderate to high-quality evidence to conclude that early amniocentesis is inferior to second trimester amniocentesis, given the increased risk of miscarriages and congential anomalies (talipes).</P>
<P>The benefits of earlier diagnosis by chorionic villus sampling (CVS) must also be set against possible higher risks of pregnancy loss and diagnostic inaccuracies when compared with second trimester amniocentesis. Unfortunately, the data related to the risk of pregnancy loss following both transabdominal and transcervical CVS and amniocentesis were inconsistent. As far as CVS method (route) is concerned, from relatively limited randomised evidence, transabdominal CVS appeared to be safer than the transcervical route.</P>
<P>The question about diagnostic accuracy of prenatal testing remains unanswered, and the hypothesis that both CVS and amniocentesis are equally accurate remains untested, because of incomplete follow-up.</P>
<P>Another area of concern is the possibility of a causal relationship between some fetal abnormalities and invasive procedures in early pregnancy. The difference in the incidence of congenital anomalies observed when early amniocentesis was compared to transabdominal CVS did not reach the conventional level for statistical significance, but it did when early amniocentesis was compared with second trimester amniocentesis.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2017-08-22 22:51:32 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Despite relatively large numbers of randomised women (4606) in <LINK REF="STD-Tabor-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Tabor 1986</LINK>, such an increase in total pregnancy loss did not reach statistical difference, with CIs for an excess pregnancy loss ranging from almost 0 to 2%. How robust are these figures, and should they be used for routine counselling? It is unlikely that a trial of similar size and quality will ever be repeated. Therefore, in the absence of other randomised data, written and oral information for women considering second trimester amniocentesis has included the data from <LINK REF="STD-Tabor-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Tabor 1986</LINK>. However, several systematis reviews that added observational data to the randomised evidence have been published since, showing significantly lower complication rates (see <LINK TAG="AGREEMENT" TYPE="SECTION">Agreements and disagreements with other studies or reviews</LINK>).</P>
<P>Second trimester amniocentesis was consistently safer than transcervical CVS, whilst <LINK REF="STD-Smidt_x002d_Jensen-1993-_x0028_Denmark_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Smidt-Jensen 1993 (Denmark)</LINK> showed no clinically significant difference in the pregnancy loss between transabdominal CVS and second trimester amniocentesis. Therefore, one would expect a clear benefit of transabdominal CVS in the 'head to head' comparisons with transcervical CVS. Unfortunately, the data were quite heterogeneous; for example, <LINK REF="STD-Smidt_x002d_Jensen-1993-_x0028_Denmark_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Smidt-Jensen 1993 (Denmark)</LINK> showed expected benefits of transabdominal CVS, but other trials did not. It is likely that operator skill and preferences played an important role in these studies.</P>
<P>It would be unrealistic to expect that any given operator would be equally skilled and experienced in all three methods. The question, whether any added risks of early procedures, transcervical CVS in particular, disappear in the hands of skilled operators remains one of the main controversies of fetal medicine. In most included trials, the operators were required to perform at least 20 successful early procedures in order to participate. Some performed thousands successfully, and therefore, undoubtedly, the experience between operators varied. Interestingly, in the <LINK REF="STD-MRC-1991" TYPE="STUDY">MRC 1991</LINK> trial, there was no clear evidence that individual operators' performance improved with more experience over the course of the study.</P>
<P>Somewhat unexpectedly, the preliminary data from the <LINK REF="STD-Nicolaides-1994-_x0028_King_x0027_s_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Nicolaides 1994 (King's)</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Leiden-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Leiden 1998</LINK> trials suggested an important increase in pregnancy loss following early amniocentesis, both before and after fetal viability. However, pooled data from the final reports of these two trials and <LINK REF="STD-Sundberg-1997-_x0028_Copenhagen_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Sundberg 1997 (Copenhagen)</LINK> were not conclusive. In order to test the hypothesis that the total pregnancy loss after early amniocentesis is indeed 0.5% higher compared with CVS, around 40,000 women would need to be recruited (power 80%, confidence level 95%). Such a trial is likely to be considered unethical, given the strong possibility of causal relationship between early amniocentesis and talipes (<I>see</I> below).</P>
<P>The observation that transabdominal CVS appeared safer than transcervical CVS was heavily influenced by the data from <LINK REF="STD-Smidt_x002d_Jensen-1993-_x0028_Denmark_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Smidt-Jensen 1993 (Denmark)</LINK>. Increase in pregnancy loss following transcervical procedure was not replicated in four other direct comparisons between transcervical and transabdominal procedures (<LINK REF="STD-Bovicelli-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Bovicelli 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Brambati-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Brambati 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tomassini-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Tomassini 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jackson-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Jackson 1992</LINK>). The transcervical approach required multiple insertions more frequently and caused vaginal bleeding in approximately 10% of cases. The subgroup analysis from <LINK REF="STD-Smidt_x002d_Jensen-1993-_x0028_Denmark_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Smidt-Jensen 1993 (Denmark)</LINK> showed no differential effect on the pregnancy loss between transabdominal CVS and mid-trimester amniocentesis. It would be reassuring if the results achieved by Smidt-Jensen and colleagues could be replicated by other centres (71% of all procedures in the <LINK REF="STD-Smidt_x002d_Jensen-1993-_x0028_Denmark_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Smidt-Jensen 1993 (Denmark)</LINK> trial were performed by Smidt-Jensen himself). The results of the systematic review of observational studies were broadly consistent with the randomised data (<LINK REF="REF-Mujezinovic-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mujezinovic 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>We acknowledge the ethical and potential medico-legal problems in trying to obtain adequate cytogenetic follow-up on all randomised women. A higher incidence of abnormal karyotypes is to be expected in the CVS group, because of possible spontaneous loss of pregnancies with abnormal karyotype that occur between randomisation and a mid-trimester amniocentesis group. With this proviso, the available data suggested that accurate diagnosis was more likely following second trimester amniocentesis. Abnormalities confined to the placenta (placental mosaics) pose a particular problem for women who opt for CVS. Although the absolute numbers were small, both known false positive and known false negative after birth results have such a devastating effect that observed differences should not be ignored.</P>
<P>An increased incidence of talipes equinovarus after early amniocentesis was specifically highlighted, with 24/2612 cases in the early amniocentesis group compared to only 5/2693 cases in the CVS group (RR 3.75, 95% CI 1.42 to 9.88; studies = four; participants = 5305). Early amniocentesis enthusiasts may argue that the possibility of ascertainment bias needs to be borne in mind when the data from unblinded trials are interpreted. However, it would be virtually impossible to blind women and clinicians to the type of invasive prenatal test actually carried out, because the type and handling of the obtained tissue (amniotic fluid or chorionic villi) are distinctly different. Under those circumstances, one may look harder for certain type of anomalies, i.e. talipes, in babies known to have early amniocentesis, and not record them when causation is unlikely (after CVS). In our view, the above data are compelling, and every effort should be made to ensure that amniocentesis is not performed before 15 weeks' gestation.</P>

<P>We judged that overall, the included studies were at low risk of bias, though specific details of the randomisation, allocation concealment, and blinding of outcome assessment were unavailable in several cases. Though it was not feasible to blind included studies due to the nature of the comparisons, <LINK REF="STD-Brambati-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Brambati 1991</LINK> was judged to be at high risk of performance bias, as the proportion of cases where the operator deviated from the allocated procedure increased significantly during the study (4.6, 9.7, and 15.5% during years one to three), with deviations weighted towards the transcervical CVS arm. <LINK REF="STD-Borrell-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Borrell 1999</LINK> was deemed to be at high risk of attrition bias due to a large and unbalanced dropout rate (assigned procedure performed in 681/1011 women). <LINK REF="STD-Nicolaides-1994-_x0028_King_x0027_s_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Nicolaides 1994 (King's)</LINK> was also judged to be at high risk of bias, partly due to the randomisation sequence described, with the selection of one of two non-sequentially numbered envelopes, and also because adverse publicity surrounding CVS caused the trial to stop prematurely.</P>
<P>We used <A HREF="http://www.guidelinedevelopment.org/">GRADEpro</A> software to grade a set of primary and secondary outcomes, where data were available. These outcomes were judged to be important for clinical decision making, and were graded for five of the comparisons. Evidence ranged from high to very low-quality. Evidence was downgraded where CIs were wide and crossed the line of nil effect, when study design limitations, such as randomisation methods, were not specified, and when heterogeneity was high between the studies.</P>
<P>For second trimester amniocentesis compared to control, we found high-quality evidence for laboratory failure, and spontaneous miscarriage, and moderate-quality evidence for all known pregnancy losses and anomalies.</P>
<P>For early compared to second trimester amniocentesis, we found high-quality evidence for laboratory failure, all known pregnancy losses, and all anomalies. We assessed the evidence to be moderate for spontaneous miscarriages, sampling failure, and false negative chromosomal diagnosis after birth.</P>
<P>For transabdominal CVS compared to amniocentesis, we judged the evidence to be low quality for spontaneous miscarriage, all known pregnancy losses, and perinatal deaths.</P>
<P>For transcervical compared to transabdominal CVS, we found moderate-quality evidence for sampling failure, and low-quality evidence for laboratory failure, and anomalies, and very low-quality for spontaneous miscarriage, and all known pregnancy losses.</P>
<P>For early amniocentesis compared to transabdominal CVS, we found moderate-quality evidence for spontaneous miscarriage, low-quality evidence for sampling and laboratory failure, all known pregnancy losses, delivery before 33 weeks' gestation, and known false negative after birth results. We only found very low-quality evidence for anomalies.</P>

<P>There is the potential to introduce bias at each stage of any review process, and necessary steps were taken to minimise specific risks. A minimum of two authors independently reviewed each study, and disagreements were resolved by discussion with a third author. At least two authors independently conducted the data extraction and 'risk of bias assessments' of each included study. 'Risk of bias' assessments will always carry an element of subjectivity, based on judgements, and for this reason cannot be considered completely objective.

<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2017-08-18 15:41:52 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We identified four non-Cochrane systematic reviews of observational studies, two assessing risks in singleton pregnancies, and two in twin pregnancies (<LINK REF="REF-Agarwal-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Agarwal 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Akolekar-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Akolekar 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mujezinovic-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mujezinovic 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vink-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vink 2012</LINK>). These reviews of observational data merit discussion, as they influenced the interpretation of procedure-related loss rates for amniocentesis and CVS, and provided some information about the magnitude of procedure-related risks in twin pregnancies (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>; <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Mujezinovic-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mujezinovic 2007</LINK> reviewed observational studies that reported complications for transabdominal CVS performed between 10 and 14 weeks' gestation, and genetic amniocentesis performed after 14 weeks' gestation. This review included studies published from January 1995, and reporting data for 100 or more participants. The pooled pregnancy loss rates within 14 days of the procedure were 0.7 (95% CI 0.3 to 1.4) and 0.6 (95% CI 0.5 to 0.7). A more recent systematic review and meta-analysis by <LINK REF="REF-Akolekar-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Akolekar 2015</LINK> reviewed observational studies published between 2000 and 2014 that reported procedure-related complications for both CVS and amniocentesis. They only included studies with more than a thousand procedures reported. In order to minimise risk of bias from smaller studies, they used a random-effects model to calculate risks. This meta-analysis described weighted pooled procedure-related risks of miscarriage for procedures performed prior to 24 weeks' gestation of 0.22% for CVS and 0.11% for amniocentesis, which was much lower than previously quoted. There was no clear difference between the procedure-related risk of miscarriage for either procedure, or to the background risk of miscarriage. The authors of these reviews highlighted concerns with the difficulty of adequate control groups. The meta-analysis in <LINK REF="REF-Akolekar-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Akolekar 2015</LINK> also found significant heterogeneity. However, it is likely that the estimates that only come from RCTs performed many years ago overestimate the risks (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>; <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Agarwal-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Agarwal 2012</LINK> completed a systematic review of observational studies in twin pregnancies to assess the risks of CVS performed between 9 and 14 weeks' gestation, and genetic amniocentesis performed between 14 and 22 weeks' gestation. They included study reports published between January 1990 and May 2011. The overall pregnancy loss rates were 3.84% (95% CI 2.48 to 5.47) for CVS, and 3.07% (95% CI 1.83 to 4.61) for amniocentesis. The authors described an excess pregnancy loss of approximately 1% above the background rate for both procedures. There were no clear differences in pregnancy loss rates between transabdominal or transcervical CVS, or amniocentesis performed with either single or double entry technique. <LINK REF="REF-Vink-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vink 2012</LINK> also conducted a systematic review of observational studies that assessed pregnancy loss rates in women with twin pregnancies undergoing genetic amniocentesis, but included a broader time-frame for publications (from January 1970 until December 2010). They used random-effects models to pool procedure-related loss rates. The authors commented on significant heterogeneity in the literature, but were able to report a pooled pregnancy loss rate before 24 weeks' gestation of 3.5% (95% CI 2.6 to 4.7). Taking into account the pregnancy loss rates before 24 weeks reported by <LINK REF="REF-Agarwal-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Agarwal 2012</LINK> and <LINK REF="REF-Vink-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vink 2012</LINK>, the true pregnancy loss rate at this gestation is likely to lie between 2.5 to 3.5% (<LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>).</P>
<P>Observational data have suggested an increased incidence of haemangiomas in infants born after their mothers underwent CVS (<LINK REF="REF-Burton-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burton 1995</LINK>). Similarly to the risk of oromandibular or limb hypogenesis, and isolated limb disruption defects, the association with CVS remains controversial (<LINK REF="REF-NICHHD-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICHHD 1993</LINK>). Plausible mechanisms include transient fetal hypoperfusion secondary to bleeding into the sampling site, the release of vasoactive substances from the placenta causing vasoconstriction or haemorrhage in the fetus, or a combination. It is reassuring that there were no reported oromandibular or limb hypoplasias in the three trials, which may reflect the fact that all procedures were done after nine weeks' gestation.</P>

<P>Parents considering prenatal diagnosis must be fully informed about the risks and benefits of the alternative procedures before they make a choice. Second trimester amniocentesis is safer than early amniocentesis or transcervical chorion villus sampling (CVS). If earlier diagnosis is required, transabdominal CVS is preferable to early amniocentesis or transcervical CVS.</P>
<P>Although CVS technique is more likely to result in an ambiguous result, the diagnostic accuracy of different methods could not be assessed adequately because of incomplete karyotype data in most studies. </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2008-07-31 12:11:50 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>New methods of prenatal diagnosis should be rigorously evaluated before deciding whether they should be introduced into clinical practice. Measures of outcome must include total pregnancy loss (antenatal and neonatal), detailed description of anomalies, diagnostic accuracy, and women's views of the alternative procedures. Ascertainment bias should be reduced as much as possible, i.e. neonatal assessors should be blinded to the allocated procedure.</P>
