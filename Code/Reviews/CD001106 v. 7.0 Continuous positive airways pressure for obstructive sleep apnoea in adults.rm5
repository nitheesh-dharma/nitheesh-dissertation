I have rewritten the text to reflect this. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;65 references pertain to 36 included studies. &lt;br&gt;--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br&gt;220605 - Changes made by TJL folowing comments by John White and John Wright. &lt;br&gt;All changes described below are in red. &lt;br&gt;1. Incorporated JWR's changes to background &amp;amp; abstract. Added some detail on prevalence, and the relationship between OSA &amp;amp; CVD risk. &lt;br&gt;2. Re-checked heterogeneity from ESS (parallel groups) Changed results section to reflect the fact that Random Effects modelling did not alter direction of the effect. &lt;br&gt;3. Added baseline on BMI &amp;amp; ESS to some of the studies where this was missing in Table of Characteristics of Included Studies. &lt;br&gt;4. Method of randomisation was reported in Becker 2003. I have added this and amended the Jadad score &amp;amp; Allocation Concealment score accordingly.&lt;br&gt;5. Checked subgroup analyses - there are incomplete data here, and I have added to this where necessary. I have also revised the section on severity of OSA in light of our inconclusive subgroup analyses, and those of Patel 2003. There are some important differences between that analysis and our review: i) they pooled parallel with crossover trials. We could do that as well, but my guess is that the crossovers will be more sensitive than parallels as they measure within (and not between) patient differences. This will mean they take up all the weight. However, the issue of attrition will be more easily controlled for in parallel trials. This could explain why the 95% CIs are wider for a sample of 470 patients in parallel trials than they are for the 249 patients in crossovers. ii) They divided the studies between excessive and non-excessive sleepiness at baseline according to mean ESS (&amp;lt;/&amp;gt; 11), whereas I have arrranged our data sets according to whether the studies recruited mild/mild to moderate/moderate or moderate to severe patients. Neither defintion is perfect, and without access to individual patient data, it's all a bit arbitrary and crude. &lt;br&gt;6. As per JWR's comment I have added paragraph on adherence. Have not gone too far down this road, as this is covered in the (excellent) review on interventions to improve adherence review. &lt;br&gt;7. Some of the wording in the Discussion relating to effectiveness seems a little extreme (can we say that weight loss is of 'doubtful' benefit when there are no trials to back that up?). I have altered this to 'in question' in the absence of any RCT evidence, and referenced the Shneerson review. &lt;br&gt;8. I have added some discussion of large scale evidence of CVD &amp;amp; treatment outcome of OSA. I have added a line in the Discussion on Becker 2003 and significant differences in sys and dia BP in favour of CPAP. The current 'best evidence' for this information is likely to be hampered because it is short-term (particularly crossover) trial data. Therefore, cohorts/observational studies with their attendant biases are likely to provide the most compelling evidence to date. Within this stratum, I think that cross-sectional data would be less appropriate than longitudinal cohorts, because they are not designed to follow-up, and are therefore not sensitive to changes in BMI, lifestyle, comorbid conditions such as diabetes, and also treatment outcome. I have referenced a cohort study in a quite select subgroup of patients which was reasonably well-controlled for some of the contributory factors outlined above (Mooe 2001). &lt;br&gt;9. OA compariosn. I think that it is important that the reviews (CPAP and OAs for OSA) are at least consistent if that comparison is to appear in both reviews. I have noted that the unpublished Fleetham 2002 trial was not included in this review (it was a parallel group trial and all the others are crossover - may be because they all wanted to show that people preferred OAs!). Tammie clearly put a lot of effort into adding data to this comparison, but I am concerned that the Fleetham trial was absent. In the OAs review we also managed to get a lot of data from the trialists. I just wonder whether to strike a balance between JW and JWR/TG/BS we should one of several options: i) We 'include' the trials in the review, but reference the results from the OAs review (in other words, we do not have the graphs for that data in our review, but we cite the pooled estimates/findings from Lim 2004). ii) We import the data from the OAs review lock, stock and barrel, and state that we have done just that. This means including the Fleetham trial (and excluding the Clark trial which was not randomised). Given the issue of preference, and its implications for the CPAP adherence message in the review, I think that we cannot ignore the evidence from these trials. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Toby &lt;br&gt;-----------------------------------------------------&lt;br&gt;14/8/2001&lt;br&gt;Technical Edit by CJC.&lt;br&gt;1. No contributions of reviewers entered.&lt;br&gt;2. Why is Jamashiro still pending classification?&lt;br&gt;3. No results of quality scores in Included trial characteristics. One trial is described as non-randomised (?should be excluded). Are all the ones not described as cross-over parallel studies?&lt;br&gt;4. SF36 scales changed to show all results and totals switched off to avoid multiple counting of non-independent results from the same patients.&lt;br&gt;5. The Metaview graphs require labels to show which direction is better ('CPAP better' on one side, 'control better' on the other). Select each outcome and then hit the edit button and choose graph and labels&lt;br&gt;6. Why are there 7 references at the end of the Background section???? These should be moved to the additional references section and hyperlinked to the text.&lt;br&gt;7. I have run spell check so please use this version for amendments!&lt;br&gt;8. Search strategy in Background does not mention the Airways Group Trials Register.&lt;br&gt;9. Why not report the results using a Random effects model for the outcomes with high heterogeneity (as part of sensitivity analysis)?&lt;br&gt;10. A good point is made about proper controls in 3 of the studies (in the discussion). I would like to see this followed with the results obtained when just such high quality studies are included. Do all the significant results disappear (it looks to me as if some remain). It is easy to calculate such results by selecting the poorer studies and deselecting them in RevMan which will then calculate only high quality study results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;13/11/2001Thanks John for sorting all of this out. I have made some minor amendments (such as altering the references to the usual Cochrane format) and have removed the negative signs from the data tables (with appropriate adjustment of the labels and text reporting of the results). This is now ready to go to Paul for final approval.&lt;br&gt;Old title: Continuous Positive Airways Pressure for Obstructive Sleep Apnoea&lt;/p&gt;" NOTES_MODIFIED="2008-07-01 11:23:59 +0100" NOTES_MODIFIED_BY="Toby J  Lasserson" REVIEW_NO="PAP-SLP" REVMAN_SUB_VERSION="5.0.13" REVMAN_VERSION="5" SPLIT_FROM="" STAGE="R" STATUS="A" TYPE="INTERVENTION" VERSION_NO="7.0">

<WHATS_NEW NOTES="&lt;p&gt;2006 update&lt;br&gt;Following a comment posted by Nathaniel Marshall we have corrected data on two of the outcomes pertaining to the measreument of anxiety and depression. The analyses have been reconducted with the correct data, and we have reported the results. This alters the conclusions of the review as the pooled effect of CPAP on anxiety and depression is no longer statistically significant. &lt;br&gt;---------------------&lt;br&gt;2005 update &lt;br&gt;Data from 26 new studies are included (Alonso 2005; Barb&amp;#232; 2001; Barnes 2002; Barnes 2004; Becker 2003; Chakravorty 2002; Coughlin 2005; Cross 2005; Egea 2004; Engleman 1998; Engleman 2002; Faccenda 2001; Fleetham 2001; Henke 2001; Kaneko 2003; Lam 2003; Lim 2005; Mansfield 2004; Marshall 2005; McArdle 2001; Monasterio 2001; Montserrat 2001; Olson 2002; Pepperell 2002; Randerath 2002; Tan 2002). Two studies previously included (Clark 1996; Dimsdale 2000) have now been excluded following modification of the inclusion criteria of the review extending minimum intervention period to two weeks. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We have made several changes to the analysis as follows. &lt;br&gt;1) Crossover studies are now analysed separately from parallel-group trials and using an appropriate statistical method (generic inverse variance). &lt;br&gt;2) There are now sufficient studies to conduct subgroup analysis by baseline disease and symptom severity, and also by control type and study duration. &lt;br&gt;3) Additional outcomes now include withdrawals, average machine usage (for sham-continuous positive airways pressure (CPAP) controlled studies) and blood pressure outcomes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The additional data confirms the previous conclusion that there was a strong symptomatic improvement with CPAP. There is increasing evidence that the perception of benefit is strongest in studies where the average baseline Epworth score is 14 and above. This requires confirmation in further studies. Sham CPAP is an adequate placebo and should be used as a control in any further studies. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The addition of several oral appliance (OA) studies has altered the conclusions with regard to the comparison between CPAP and OA, whereby the data for preference do not show a demonstrable and consistent preference for either of the two treatment options. However, when preference is sought from those who have responded to both treatment options, OAs are more frequently preferred to CPAP. CPAP remains more effective at reducing apnoea. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Future research should begin to address long-term adherence and cardiovascular morbidity associated with obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA). This will help contextualise the positive findings of the studies, which are largely short term. &lt;br&gt;---------------------&lt;br&gt;2001 update&lt;br&gt;New evidence for the effectiveness of CPAP was included. The quality of trials was also improving, with sham CPAP established as a safe and comparable control that enabled double-blind study design. &lt;br&gt;The trial evidence demonstrated that CPAP was an effective treatment for people with moderate to severe sleep apnoea, although individuals preferred oral appliances.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;">

<SUMMARY>
<TITLE>Continuous positive airways pressure for relieving signs and symptoms of obstructive sleep apnoea</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Obstructive sleep apnoea is the term used to describe the interruption in normal breathing of individuals during sleep. It is caused by collapse of the upper airways during sleep and is strongly associated with obesity. The mainstay of medical treatment is a machine used at night to apply continuous positive airways pressure (CPAP). The machine blows air through the upper air passages via a mask on the mouth or nose to keep the throat open. We searched and reviewed all randomised controlled trials that had been undertaken to evaluate the benefit of CPAP in adult patients with sleep apnoea. Some of the trials had methodological flaws, although more recent studies have begun to use appropriate forms of control. The overall results demonstrate that in people with moderate to severe sleep apnoea CPAP can improve measures of sleepiness, quality of life and associated daytime sleepiness. CPAP leads to lower blood pressure compared with control, although the degree to which this is achieved may depend upon whether people start treatment with raised blood pressures. Oral appliances are also used to treat sleep apnoea but, whilst some people find them more convenient to use than CPAP, they do not appear to be as effective at keeping the airway open at night. Further good quality trials are needed to define who benefits, by how much and at what cost. Further trials are also needed to evaluate the effectiveness of CPAP in comparison to other interventions, particularly those targeted at obesity.</P>
</SUMMARY_BODY>
</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Obstructive sleep apnoea is the periodic reduction (hypopnoea) or cessation (apnoea) of breathing due to narrowing or occlusion of the upper airway during sleep. The main symptom is daytime sleepiness and it has been suggested it is linked to premature death, hypertension, ischaemic heart disease, stroke and road traffic accidents.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>The main treatment for sleep apnoea is with the use of continuous positive airways pressure (CPAP), which requires a flow generator and mask. These are used at night to prevent apnoea, hypoxia and sleep disturbance. The objective was to assess the effects of CPAP in the treatment of obstructive sleep apnoea in adults.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>We searched the Cochrane Airways Group Trials Register and reference lists of articles. We consulted experts in the field. Searches were current to July 2005.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>We included randomised trials comparing nocturnal CPAP with an inactive control or oral appliances in adults with obstructive sleep apnoea (an apnoea and hypopnoea index greater than five per hour). Trials had a minimum intervention period of two weeks.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Trial quality was assessed and two review authors extracted data independently. Study authors were contacted for missing information. Parallel and crossover group trials were analysed separately.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Thirty-six trials involving 1718 people met the inclusion criteria. Study quality was mixed. Compared with control, CPAP showed significant improvements in certain objective and subjective sleepiness, measures of quality of life and cognitive function (parallel-group studies: Epworth sleepiness scale (ESS) -3.83 units, 95% CI -4.57 to -3.09; crossover studies: ESS -1.84 units, 95% CI -2.57 to -1.11). Twenty-four hour systolic and diastolic blood pressures were lower with CPAP compared with control (parallel-group trials). Compared with oral appliances, CPAP significantly reduced the apnoea and hypopnoea index (crossover studies: -7.97 events/hr, 95% CI -9.56 to -6.38) and improved sleep efficiency (crossover studies: 2.31%, 95% CI 0.02 to 4.6) and minimum oxygen saturation (4.14%, 95% CI 3.25 to 5.03). Responders to both treatments expressed a strong preference for the oral appliance. However, participants were more likely to withdraw on OA than on CPAP therapy.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>CPAP is effective in reducing symptoms of sleepiness and improving quality of life measures in people with moderate and severe obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA). It is more effective than oral appliances in reducing respiratory disturbances in these people but subjective outcomes are more equivocal. Certain people tend to prefer oral appliances to CPAP where both are effective. This could be because they offer a more convenient way of controlling OSA. Short-term data indicate that CPAP leads to lower blood pressure than control. Long-term data are required for all outcomes in order to determine whether the initial benefits seen in short-term clinical trials persist.</P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
</ABSTRACT>
<BODY MODIFIED="2008-07-01 11:23:22 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J  Lasserson">
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is a condition characterised by the presence of repetitive upper airway obstruction during sleep. The mechanism remains uncertain but OSA sufferers have functionally impaired upper airway muscles, causing a reduction in tonic and phasic contraction during sleep (<LINK REF="REF-Deegan-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deegan 1995</LINK>). Commonly the reduced contractions cause partial (hypopnoea) or complete (apnoea) occlusion of airflow, resulting in oxygen desaturation and sleep fragmentation. Excessive daytime sleepiness, snoring, impaired alertness and reduction in cognitive function are common symptoms which are thought to be a cause of hypertension, ischaemic heart disease, myocardial infarction, stroke, road traffic accidents and premature death (<LINK REF="REF-Mayer-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mayer 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wright-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wright 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>Precise estimates of OSA prevalence are hampered by the poor correlation between physiological and subjective markers, meaning that OSA can be undiagnosed in asymptomatic individuals (<LINK REF="REF-Stradling-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stradling 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Young-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Young 2002</LINK>). Nevertheless, recent epidemiological evidence indicates that it is a condition which affects around 4% of middle-aged men and 2% of middle-aged women (<LINK REF="REF-Young-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Young 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Young-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Young 2002</LINK>). Studies have shown that OSA is a predictive risk factor for a variety of cardiovascular diseases, such as stroke and hypertension (<LINK REF="REF-Lavie-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lavie 2004</LINK>). However, coexisting risk factors in people with OSA, such as high body mass index (BMI) and being of middle age, could also contribute to cardiovascular disease (<LINK REF="REF-Stradling-2004a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stradling 2004a</LINK>). OSA has become a major public health hazard due to the associated morbidity and mortality (<LINK REF="REF-Wright-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wright 1997</LINK>). There are a variety of treatment options for obstructive sleep apnoea which include behavioural modifications, continuous positive airways pressure, oral appliances, and surgery and drug regimes.</P>
<P>Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) has been proposed as the most effective treatment for obstructive sleep apnoea and has become the treatment of choice for clinicians (<LINK REF="REF-SIGN-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">SIGN 2003</LINK>). It consists of a nasal or oro-nasal mask held in position with elastic headgear and attached to a flow generator by elephant tubing. The flow generator is set to a specific pressure to produce a force great enough to maintain airway patency and overcome the respiratory disturbance. The provision of ventilatory assistance during sleep reduces sleep fragmentation and overcomes symptoms of obstructive sleep apnoea. Continuous positive airway pressure is a long-term treatment that requires compliance. Various mechanical interventions have been designed to improve compliance, such as automatic titration CPAP (auto-CPAP) which optimises CPAP level throughout the night and bi-level PAP, which reduces expiratory pressure to increase comfort (<LINK REF="REF-Haniffa-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haniffa 2004</LINK>). </P>
<P>Currently available treatment modalities in OSA include oral appliance devices (OAs), which increase pharyngeal space by protruding the mandible and advancing the tongue. Studies have indicated that OAs are less effective than CPAP in overcoming the respiratory disturbance and can cause discomfort (<LINK REF="REF-Lim-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lim 2004</LINK>). Although lifestyle management such as weight loss, cessation of smoking and avoiding decaffeinated drinks and alcohol is recommended, evidence of their effectiveness is lacking (<LINK REF="REF-Shneerson-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shneerson 2001</LINK>). <BR/>Surgery aims to relieve any airway obstruction by increasing airway surface area and is a form of reconstructive surgery. Uvulopalatopharyngoplasty (UPPP) is one of several surgical treatments currently used, although evidence of its effectiveness in large clinical trials is scant (<LINK REF="REF-Sundaram-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sundaram 2005</LINK>). </P>
<P>Extensive research has been conducted to identify the effectiveness of drug therapy. Protriptyline has led to improvements in daytime function but with no improvements in the frequency of apnoea. Acetazolamide has been shown to reduce apnoea but it is poorly tolerated. There is no strong evidence that drug therapy is successful (<LINK REF="REF-Smith-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smith 2004</LINK>). <BR/>Various methodologies have been used to assess the effectiveness of applying continuous positive airways pressure in numerous clinical trials. This review seeks to bring evidence from these studies together and assess overall efficacy and tolerability.</P>

<SEARCH_METHODS>
<P>A systematic search was undertaken using structured national guidelines. A computerised search of the Cochrane Airways Group RCT register (MEDLINE (1966 to July 2005), EMBASE (1974-2005) and CINAHL (1982- July 2005)) was carried out. For the MEDLINE search the following thesaurus terms (MeSH) were used:<BR/>Sleep apnoea syndromes (exploded); positive-pressure respiration (exploded); Mortality; Morbidity (exploded); Hypertension (exploded); Cerebrovascular disorders (exploded); Accidents, traffic (exploded); Automobile driving (exploded); Myocardial infarction (exploded); Arrhythmia (exploded); Heart failure, congestive (exploded); coronary disease (exploded); Myocardial ischemia; anoxaemia.</P>
<P>The following text words were used:<BR/>Apn*ea; obstructive sleep apn*ea; hypopn*ea; sahs (sleep apnoea/hypopnoea syndrome); osa; continuous positive airway* pressure; CPAP; high blood pressure; stroke; coronary thrombosis; coronary artery disease; isch*emic heart disease; daytime sleepiness; hyper somnolence; hypoxemia; heart attack*; falling asleep at the wheel.</P>
<P>The MEDLINE thesaurus terms were translated across into equivalent EMBASE thesaurus terms for searching on EMBASE.</P>
<P>Existing reviews were sought and reference lists of identified papers were scanned. Researchers and clinical experts who are active in the area were approached to identify other, either unpublished or ongoing studies. Abstracts and letters were included if they contained sufficient methodological information and results.</P>

<BR/>All included studies were randomised. Fifteen were parallel-group trials, two were partial crossovers (that is the control group received deferred active treatment) and the remainder were crossovers.</P>
<P>
<B>Participants</B>
<BR/>The studies recruited middle-aged participants (mean age 36 to 71 years) who suffered from mild to severe OSA (AHI 5 to 129). Participants were mainly overweight (mean BMIs: 28 to 36). Three studies recruited people with co-existing hypertension or heart failure (<LINK REF="STD-Egea-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Egea 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kaneko-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Kaneko 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mansfield-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Mansfield 2004</LINK>).</P>

<B>Interventions</B>
<BR/>Nine crossover studies evaluated CPAP compared with inactive oral placebo tablet (<LINK REF="STD-Barnes-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Barnes 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Barnes-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Barnes 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Engleman-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Engleman 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Engleman-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Engleman 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Engleman-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Engleman 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Engleman-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Engleman 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Engleman-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Engleman 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Faccenda-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Faccenda 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McArdle-2001" TYPE="STUDY">McArdle 2001</LINK>). All participants were told that the placebo tablet may improve upper airway function and, with the exception of <LINK REF="STD-Barnes-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Barnes 2004</LINK>, included no wash in or out period. Ranitidine was used as the inactive tablet for five of these studies. Three studies were of similar design for participant recruitment although outcomes differed (<LINK REF="STD-Engleman-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Engleman 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Engleman-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Engleman 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Engleman-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Engleman 1998</LINK>).

<P>A summary of the risk of bias in the generation and concealment of allocation sequences is provided in <LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>. The majority of studies did not report the processes by which participants were allocated to treatment groups, hence the large number of studies judged to be 'unclear'. </P>
<P>The reporting of methodological quality in 29 of the 36 studies was poor (Jadad scores 1 or 2). There are two principal reasons for this. Firstly, methods of randomisation were not stated in many of these papers (for example they were unpublished conference abstracts) and secondly, blinding was not possible in many of the studies because of the lack of a comparable placebo. Studies which randomised between active and sham-CPAP performed baseline polysomnography with either therapeutic or subtherapeutic treatment pressure levels depending on the treatment group of the participants.</P>
<P>Treatment order effects from the crossover design were possible and learning effects were apparent in one study (<LINK REF="STD-Engleman-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Engleman 1994</LINK>). None of the seven studies that compared CPAP to a placebo tablet incorporated washout periods or carried out adequate test for differential carryover effects from intervention treatment order. However, the effect of CPAP seems to be short lasting and results may not have been altered by a prolonged washout period. The recording of data at the end of crossover periods as absolute scores lessens the impact of carryover.</P>

<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS MODIFIED="2008-07-01 11:23:22 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J  Lasserson">
<P>We reported data for two comparisons: i) CPAP versus placebo or control (including conservative management) and ii) CPAP versus oral appliance therapy. Our findings for the comparison of CPAP with oral appliance therapy duplicated those reported in <LINK REF="REF-Lim-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lim 2004</LINK>. We have opted to retain data relevant to that comparison in both reviews in order that each review can be regarded as a stand-alone source of evidence.<BR/>
<U>
<BR/>
<B>CPAP versus placebo or conservative treatment</B>
</U>
</P>
<P>
<B>Sleepiness</B>
<BR/>There were significant improvements in both subjective and objective sleepiness as expressed by the Epworth sleepiness scale (ESS), MSLT and MWT in favour of CPAP when compared with sham CPAP, a dummy tablet or conservative management.</P>
<P>
<I>Parallel and partial crossover studies</I>
<BR/>There was a significant difference in favour of CPAP in the ESS (-3.83 units, 95% CI -4.57 to -3.09; 10 studies, total number of participants (N) = 712, <LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>). Data were estimated for <LINK REF="STD-Henke-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Henke 2001</LINK> (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>). Despite a high level of statistical heterogeneity (I2 67.1%), random-effects modelling gave a similar pooled result with ESS (-3.83 units, 95% CI -5.16 to -2.49). One study indicated improvements in objective sleepiness measured by the MWT (<LINK REF="STD-Jenkinson-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Jenkinson 1999</LINK>). MSLT was not significantly different between CPAP and control (-0.17 units, 95% CI -1.65 to 1.31; three studies, N = 232).</P>
<P>
<I>Crossover studies</I>
<BR/>There was a significant difference in ESS in favour of CPAP (-1.92 units, 95% CI -2.59 to -1.25; seven studies, N = 278, <LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK>) with significant heterogeneity (I2 56.2%). Random-effects modelling did not alter the effect (ESS -2.13 units, 95% CI -3.26 to -1.01). There were significant differences in favour of CPAP for MWT (2.36 min, 95% CI 0.31 to 4.40; three studies, N = 143) and MSLT (1.25 min, 95% CI 0.18 to 2.32; four studies, N = 99). However, there was a moderate degree of heterogeneity for the MSLT outcome. Random-effects modelling resulted in a non-significant difference (0.95 min, 95% CI -0.59 to 2.5).</P>
<P>
<I>Subgroup analysis</I>
<BR/>We undertook subgroup analyses according to baseline symptoms, severity of mean baseline AHI and study duration. There was evidence of a more pronounced effect in the parallel-group studies where participants had a mean baseline ESS above 14 compared with those whose symptoms were less than 10 (-5.36 units versus -1.21 units, P value 0.0007). This finding should be viewed with some caution as there was less evidence of such a distinction in the crossover trials, and these subgroups have been identified post hoc.<BR/>

<I>Parallel and partial crossover studies</I>
<BR/>Physical function (6.82 units, 95% CI 1.75 to 11.88; three studies, N = 188) and general health (6.54 units, 95% CI 0.41 to 12.67; three studies, N = 188) components of the SF-36 indicated consistent and significant improvements in health status in favour of CPAP. There was significant statistical heterogeneity for the vitality, physical role, mental role and mental health domains. Random-effects modelling eliminated significant summary estimates for these domains. The low number of studies reporting this outcome limited meaningful exploration of heterogeneity. Further studies contributing to this outcome would help to derive a more reliable overview. <LINK REF="STD-Montserrat-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Montserrat 2001</LINK> reported significant difference in vigilance in favour of CPAP as measured by the functional outcome sleep questionnaire. <LINK REF="STD-Chakravorty-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Chakravorty 2002</LINK> reported no difference on the Euroqol.</P>
<P>
<I>Crossover studies</I>
<BR/>The vitality domain of the SF-36 favoured CPAP over control (8.12 units, 95% CI 2.29 to 13.95; three studies, N = 91). There were no significant differences on the other domains. The functional outcomes of sleep questionnaire was used by three studies. CPAP was effective in improving social outcome (0.18 units, 95% CI 0 to 0.36; N = 125), activity level (0.17 units, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.29; N = 125) and vigilance (0.15 units, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.28; N = 120).</P>

<BR/>Although <LINK REF="STD-Ballester-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Ballester 1999</LINK> reported a significant reduction in the Nottingham health profile (NHP) this could not be combined with other studies (<LINK REF="STD-Engleman-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Engleman 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Engleman-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Engleman 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Engleman-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Engleman 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Engleman-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Engleman 1999</LINK>) in which results for NHP part 2 were available (energy domain only). CPAP led to significant improvements in the Nottingham health profile part 2 (-1.68 units, 95% CI -2.80 to -0.57) and UMACL (-1.66 units, 95% CI -0.01 to 3.33). Random-effects modelling eliminated the significant results from the GHQ-28. The hospital anxiety and depression scale (HADS) showed no significant improvement in anxiety (-0.36 units, 95% CI: -0.96 to 0.25; five studies, N = 134). The pooled fixed effect effect for depression significantly favoured CPAP (-0.68 units (95% CI -1.26 units to -0.10; five studies, N = 134). However, due to the high level of statistical heterogeneity, we applied Random Effects modelling, giving a non-significant result for the depression score (-0.93 (95% CI -1.94 to 0.08).

Mean 24 hr systolic and diastolic blood pressures (BP) were significantly lower on CPAP (systolic: -7.24 mmHg, 95% CI -11.54 to -2.94 in three studies, N = 267; diastolic: -3.07 mmHg, 95% CI -5.35 to -0.78 in three studies, N = 267). When data were pooled for <LINK REF="STD-Becker-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Becker 2003</LINK> and Barbè2001 the findings were conflicting, with <LINK REF="STD-Becker-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Becker 2003</LINK> reporting positive findings and Barbè2001 reporting negative results. Possible reasons for this are varied but may include differences between the studies in baseline blood pressure, with entry criteria and the control group data for Barbè2001 suggestive of more normal blood pressure levels in this sample of participants compared with those of <LINK REF="STD-Becker-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Becker 2003</LINK>.</P>
<P>Seven studies reported the effects of CPAP on AHI. Differing effect sizes and precision of estimates made a summary effect estimate hard to validate. However, all the studies reported significant findings in favour of CPAP over control, and fixed-effect and random effects-modelling were both significant (-17.02 events/hour, 95% CI -19.25 to -14.80 versus -26.49 events/hour, 95% CI -35.64 to -17.34).

<BR/>Active CPAP was used more frequently than sham CPAP (mean difference (MD) 0.52 hours/night, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.92; six studies, N = 383). There was no significant differences between CPAP and control in the likelihood of withdrawal from the studies (OR 1.04, 95% CI 0.7 to 1.54; 12 studies, N = 853).

</INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) and its treatment remains the subject of intense debate due to the large potential public health impact of the disease and its economic implications. Whilst clinical experience suggests continuous positive airways pressure (CPAP) is beneficial in reducing symptoms of sleepiness resulting from OSA, the initial version of this review found few randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of sufficient quality to support this conclusion. This second update reflects evidence from 36 RCTs. </P>
<P>
<B>CPAP efficacy<BR/>
</B>When compared with a placebo pill or sham CPAP, there is benefit in favour of CPAP in terms of quality of life and an improvement in objective and subjective measures of sleepiness. The improvement in Nottingham health profile, GHQ, FOSQ and SF-36 reflects an improvement in self-reported health status which may relate to a feeling of increased wellbeing following treatment of sleepiness. There were inconsistent effects in the hospital anxiety and depression scale, and further studies would help to establish whether the discrepancy between the fixed effect and random effects models reflects differences in study characteristics (such as study duration and type of control, or differences in indices of baseline mood between study populations). <BR/> <BR/>Most of the improvements in outcome measures are relatively small and do not appear to reflect the dramatic changes noted in clinical practice. The large improvements in health status seen in the domains of the SF-36 more closely reflect the benefits reported by individuals in the sleep clinic and this may be a more sensitive outcome measure which could be adopted in future trials. The small but significant improvement in daytime oxygenation is of interest but of uncertain clinical significance. Where measured, blood pressure outcomes were on the whole significantly lower for those treated with CPAP. The size of the differences observed may well depend upon the degree of hypertension in the participants recruited. The reductions seen in these populations may be meaningful but data from normotensive participants in the same studies could dilute differential effects. </P>
<P>Outcome measures were recorded in the included trials at between two weeks and 12 months after starting treatment. There are no data from these trials concerning the sustainability of health benefits or about night-to-night variability. Observation suggests that benefits are short lasting once CPAP is withdrawn.<B>
<BR/>
</B>
</P>
<P>
<B>CPAP compared with other treatments<BR/>
</B>There are several studies that compare CPAP with other interventions. Four studies (<LINK REF="STD-Ballester-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Ballester 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chakravorty-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Chakravorty 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lojander-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Lojander 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Monasterio-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Monasterio 2001</LINK>) compared CPAP to conservative treatment such as postural advice and weight loss. Evidence of effective methods of weight loss was evident in <LINK REF="STD-Chakravorty-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Chakravorty 2002</LINK>, with improvements in AHI and symptoms accompanying a reduction in body mass index (BMI). Clarification of these effects in further studies is required. The positive effect of CPAP is evident from short-term clinical trials whereas a lifestyle intervention may require longer than two weeks to show similar (if any) effectiveness. Although weight loss in people who are clinically obese may confer a range of health benefits, including reduction in risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, the short-term impact on the signs and symptoms of sleep apnoea is uncertain (<LINK REF="REF-Shneerson-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shneerson 2001</LINK>). </P>
<P>Use of CPAP has also been compared with oral appliances. All appliances have a similar mechanism of action in that they cause anterior displacement of the mandible, thus increasing the diameter of the upper airways. One of the appliances studied allows the angle and degree of displacement to be varied for individual fine-tuning. The studies comparing these devices to CPAP have shown significant benefits in favour of CPAP in two out of five indicators of respiratory disturbance, after a study period of four months. However, symptoms and quality of life showed less certain effects. The inconvenience associated with the noise of the CPAP machine and its cumbersome nature partly account for its lack of universal acceptance, especially where poor tolerability outweighs perceived benefit. Thus, preference for an OA in a sample of participants identified as responders may well reflect the relative convenience of using the devices as much as it reflects their relative efficacy (<LINK REF="STD-Barnes-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Barnes 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ferguson-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Ferguson 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ferguson-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Ferguson 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Olson-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Olson 2002</LINK>). Preference outcomes are prone to order effects as they can only be measured after exposure to the two treatment arms. The extent to which this applies may vary from study to study. Study withdrawal is an important consideration in assessing the validity of preference. According to this outcome, participants were less likely to remain on OA therapy than on CPAP. Where withdrawal occurs during the first arm of crossover studies, the number of preferences that can be expressed for either treatment option will be affected. The variation between preferences expressed in each study could reflect different withdrawal rates and order effects between the studies in addition to the relative tolerability and efficacy of the two devices. Adverse events have been reported in only a subset of the studies, yet tolerability is potentially important in understanding withdrawal and treatment preference. From the evidence available, fewer participants were able to persist with OA. It could be that in those who were able to persist with both OA and CPAP, OA represented a more attractive option than CPAP. Subgroup analysis from one of the studies suggested that preference may be related to baseline symptoms and quality of life, with greater impairment in both these variables predicting preference for CPAP over an oral appliance (<LINK REF="STD-Engleman-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Engleman 2002</LINK>). </P>
<P>Only one study has compared CPAP with a backpack device (<LINK REF="STD-Jokic-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Jokic 1999</LINK>), in a limited number of people who only suffered OSA when sleeping supine. CPAP was more effective in treating nocturnal respiratory disturbance but otherwise the treatments appeared equivalent. However, this is a small subgroup of all those with OSA and thus the impact of this alternative therapy in clinical practice is uncertain.</P>
<P>
<B>Subgroup analyses<BR/>
</B>We undertook subgroup analyses on the primary efficacy outcome. These were done according to baseline symptoms, the apnoea and hyopnoea index (AHI), study duration and type of control. The more pronounced effect of CPAP in parallel-group studies conducted in participants with moderate and severe symptoms at baseline is a plausible explanation for the heterogeneity between the trials. Nevertheless, it must be treated with caution as mean baseline symptoms did not adequately explain heterogeneity between crossover studies. Furthermore, distinctions based around average baseline data may not adequately reflect differing responses to therapy within each study. The participants included in the trials varied in the severity of their disease (mean AHI 10 to 56) but this did not predict their response to therapy. This finding reinforces the widely held view that there is poor correlation between symptoms and AHI. There was a tendency for studies to recruit people with moderate and severe sleepiness. Given the potential for a negative effect in more mildly affected participants, it is possible that we have missed unpublished negative data. </P>
<P>A recent meta-analysis of CPAP studies assessing the Epworth sleepiness scale (ESS) also cautiously concluded that symptomatic patients benefited more from treatment than did those demonstrating fewer symptoms at baseline (<LINK REF="REF-Patel-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Patel 2003</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-Patel-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Patel 2003</LINK> divided studies between excessive and non-excessive sleepiness at baseline, based upon average ESS (less than or greater than 11). However, the severity of symptoms between these studies was arguably more varied. Unlike in <LINK REF="REF-Patel-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Patel 2003</LINK>, we have clustered studies in more discrete subgroupings and have also separated parallel-group and crossover studies thus potentially decreasing the statistical power of our subgroup analyses. The degree of overlap between the subgroup estimates probably reflects the censored availability of trial data in our analyses.<B>
<BR/>
</B>
</P>
<P>
<B>Methodological considerations/Limitations of the review<BR/>
</B>A previous review expressed concerns over the quality of studies where a placebo tablet and the noisy machine with a tight fitting nasal mask of CPAP were compared (<LINK REF="REF-Wright-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wright 1997</LINK>). Sham CPAP has now been used successfully in many of the studies identified in the searches for this review (<LINK REF="STD-Becker-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Becker 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Barb_x00e8_-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Barbè 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Coughlin-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Coughlin 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Henke-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Henke 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jenkinson-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Jenkinson 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Loredo-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Loredo 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Montserrat-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Montserrat 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pepperell-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Pepperell 2002</LINK>). There were concerns over the ethics and safety of using sham CPAP. It was thought that the inconvenience of sham treatment without any benefit might bias findings in favour of therapeutic CPAP (<LINK REF="STD-Faccenda-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Faccenda 2001</LINK>). A post-hoc subgroup analysis by control type showed similar symptomatic responses for studies using conservative management and sham CPAP as the controls (ESS -3.26 versus -4.21 units, P value 0.21). </P>
<P>Active CPAP machine usage was greater than sham-CPAP usage. This finding comes from a number of parallel-group trials conducted in people with moderate to severe and severe symptoms at baseline. Two possible scenarios may affect the extent to which sham-CPAP controlled studies overestimate treatment efficacy. Firstly, undetectable positive pressure is a threat to blinding as participants recognise absent treatment pressure and subsequently use inactive CPAP less frequently. The studies in this review performed familiarisation sessions with active or sham-CPAP intervention as appropriate. Blinding can be more reliably maintained in previously untreated people. It is, therefore, more appropriate to use sham CPAP as control in parallel-group rather than crossover studies. Secondly, an adherence differential reflects a perceptibly greater health benefit, such that better usage of CPAP is a corollary of symptomatic improvement (<LINK REF="REF-Kingshott-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kingshott 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Marshall-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Marshall 2005</LINK>). The profile of those participating in these sham-CPAP controlled studies suggested that they were likely to perceive symptomatic benefit. Additional research would help to explore the patterns of CPAP usage and how they reflect ongoing perception of benefit. </P>
<P>There is uncertainty over the effect of CPAP on the long-term incidence or outcomes of other medical conditions possibly associated with OSA, such as hypertension, cerebrovascular disease, cardiopulmonary disease and road traffic accidents. Associated factors that could contribute to hypertension in sleep apnoea include increased inspiratory effort or raised partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) levels (<LINK REF="REF-Pepperell-2002a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pepperell 2002a</LINK>). There is some evidence that CPAP reduces blood pressure where this is raised at baseline (<LINK REF="STD-Becker-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Becker 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pepperell-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Pepperell 2002</LINK>). Reporting of medications being used by patients to control blood pressure is therefore important in future studies. Available data on change in plasma levels from two randomised trials in people with OSA, are limited by the short exposure to treatment and small study samples (<LINK REF="REF-Robinson-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Robinson 2004</LINK>). It is possible that the most readily available source of evidence for long-term implications of under-diagnosis and subsequent under-treatment of OSA on blood pressure outcomes currently emanate from observational studies, where adjustment for confounders (such as male gender, age and obesity) is difficult (<LINK REF="REF-Wright-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wright 1997</LINK>). A prospective cohort of 408 people with confirmed cardiovascular disease followed up for five years indicated that the presence of sleep-disordered breathing (defined as AHI &gt; 10) increased the likelihood of death, cerebrovascular events or myocardial infarction (<LINK REF="REF-Mooe-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mooe 2001</LINK>). However, in the same cohort diabetes was also a predictive risk factor (<LINK REF="REF-Mooe-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mooe 2001</LINK>). </P>
<P>This review has assessed CPAP efficacy and tolerability from randomised trials. The majority of studies followed up participants for a limited period of time. Given that OSA is a chronic problem, successful outcome of treatment with CPAP or any other ongoing therapy will be linked with its continued acceptance. The behaviour of participants in the studies assembled in this review may reflect the short period of exposure to treatment (<LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>). The reported acceptance of CPAP therapy in clinical practice is low (<LINK REF="REF-Haniffa-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haniffa 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stepnowsky-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stepnowsky 2003</LINK>). There is evidently a complex relationship between severity of symptoms prompting presentation, sustained perception of improvement in symptoms, health beliefs and tolerability (<LINK REF="REF-Haniffa-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haniffa 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wild-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wild 2004</LINK>). Machine usage could also reflect a form of natural titration whereby people are prompted to use their machines reactively in response to their symptoms rather than prospectively following a prescribed exposure to CPAP to prevent their onset (<LINK REF="REF-Stepnowsky-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stepnowsky 2003</LINK>). </P>
<P>Study design is important in understanding the relationship between patient characteristics and adherence. Randomised studies provide reliable insights into different patient subgroups and their response to therapy over a short period of time. The patterns of usage suggest that study populations are not representative of everyday clinical experience, particularly where adherence is overtly monitored (<LINK REF="REF-Haniffa-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haniffa 2004</LINK>). The effects of CPAP in the crossover studies and parallel-group trials support its short-term efficacy. Due to ongoing concerns as to how people continue with treatment, and the evident superiority of CPAP to oral appliances in reducing apnoea, there are areas which require elucidation. Long-term parallel-group trials may be more efficient at capturing important information regarding persistence of benefit, convenience of continued usage, loss to follow up and cardiovascular outcome of CPAP treatment.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>Although certain questions remain over the definition and maintenance of control groups in obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) studies in adults, the evidence demonstrates significant benefit in sleepiness and health status with continuous positive airways pressure (CPAP) when compared to sham CPAP, dummy pill or conservative management, and in respiratory disturbances when compared with oral appliances. There is stronger evidence of effectiveness in symptomatic patients with moderate and severe apnoea and hypopnoea indices (AHI). When compared with use of an oral appliance symptoms did not show a significant difference, but additional data are required. Preference data did not show a consistent difference and could reflect differences in appliance tolerability, order effects and withdrawal of participants. People who respond to both CPAP and oral appliances are more likely to prefer an oral appliance, but study withdrawal favoured CPAP. The available evidence supports the use of CPAP as first-line treatment for people with high AHI and moderate-to-severe sleepiness associated with obstructive sleep apnoea. Some patients offered CPAP might not accept it or struggle to continue with therapy. Where this is so, patients should be provided with alternative options. Recommendations should be seen in the context of the uncertain long-term effects of the treatment options available, and patients should be offered support in adhering with treatment given the potential risks of under-treatment of sleep-disordered breathing.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Further work is required to determine which groups of people are most likely to benefit (in terms of disease severity), how much benefit can be achieved, at what cost and how such people can be simply identified. </P>

<TITLE>Error in data extraction</TITLE>

<FEEDBACK_SUMMARY>
<P>I have noticed some worrying discrepancies between the published version of our trial (Marshall et al Thorax 2005 60 427-432) and the analysis of CPAP's effect on mood measured via the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. It seems that these have been entered into the analysis is if the effect of CPAP was greater than shamCPAP. In fact the opposite was true.</P>
<P>This seems like it might change the results of the HADS analyses for crossover trials.</P>
</FEEDBACK_SUMMARY>
<FEEDBACK_REPLY>
<P>Many thanks for this comment. On re-reading the trial report it is clear that an error occured in the process of extracting the data and the direction of effect was misinterpreted. We are grateful that this has been brought to our attention and we have revised the review accordingly.</P>
