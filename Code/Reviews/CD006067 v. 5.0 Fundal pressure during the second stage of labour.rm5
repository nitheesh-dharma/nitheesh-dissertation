Fetal distress, failure to progress, maternal exhaustion or a medical condition where prolonged pushing is dangerous, can complicate this stage. Applying fundal pressure by pushing on the mother&#8217;s abdomen in the direction of the birth canal is often used to assist spontaneous vaginal birth, shorten the length of the second stage and reduce the need for instrumental birth (forceps- or vacuum-assisted) or caesarean section. It is particularly relevant in low-resource settings where options for operative birth are limited or not available. Manual pressure can be applied each time the woman has a contraction. Alternatively an inflatable belt can be worn which inflates to apply pressure during the contractions.</P><P>This review aimed to answer whether fundal pressure during contractions in the second stage of labour helps women give birth vaginally, and whether it causes any negative consequences for the woman or her unborn baby.</P><P><B>Why is this important?</B></P><P>A long labour can sometimes be dangerous for some women and their babies. Sometimes the unborn baby and woman can become exhausted during the labour and birth. In many countries, there are trained professionals who can assist with ventouse, forceps or caesarean sections. However in other countries, these resources are often lacking, and long labours can be life-threatening. Fundal pressure may help the woman to give birth. It may also possibly increase complications for the baby and mother. There is not a lot of knowledge on this topic, and it is important to know how these techniques might affect the women and their babies.</P><P><B>What evidence did we find?</B></P><P>This updated Cochrane Review found nine randomised controlled trials involving 3948 women (search date 30 November 2016). Five studies (including 3057 women) looked at manual fundal pressure versus no fundal pressure and four studies (including 891 women) looked at fundal pressure applied using an inflatable belt.</P><P>We found no evidence that manual fundal pressure made a difference to numbers of women giving birth vaginally within a given time (very low-quality evidence), or having an instrumental birth, caesarean section, or vaginal birth (very low-quality evidence). The time women took to give birth when pushing was not affected by manual fundal pressure (very low-quality evidence). The numbers of babies who did not cope well with labour and had low arterial cord pH, or low Apgar scores were the same whether their mother had fundal pressure or not (all very low-quality evidence). No babies died in either group. Studies did not report on possible severe problems or death of the women.</P><P>For women giving birth for the first time, fundal pressure by inflatable belt could possibly mean that fewer women had an instrumental or caesarean birth (very low-quality evidence), but the evidence was not clear. In these women, the inflatable belt meant they pushed for less time than women pushing without the belt (very low-quality evidence). The inflatable belt did not make any difference to numbers of women having caesarean sections, babies with low arterial cord pH (low-quality evidence), or Apgar scores five minutes after birth (very low-quality evidence). No studies reported if the women gave birth within a given time, numbers of babies that died or possible serious problems or death of the women. No studies used inflatable belts in women who had given birth before.</P><P><B>What does this mean?</B></P><P>There is not enough evidence from randomised controlled trials to show whether manual fundal pressure or fundal pressure by inflatable belt are effective ways of shortening the pushing stage of labour and avoiding operative births, and whether the techniques are safe. So currently there is insufficient evidence to support the use of fundal pressure by any method in the second stage of labour.</P><P>Future studies should be of good quality, clearly describe how fundal pressure was applied, and focus on safety of the unborn baby, perineal outcomes, longer-term maternal outcomes and the mothers&#8217; satisfaction.</P></SUMMARY_BODY></SUMMARY><ABSTRACT MODIFIED="2017-02-17 09:07:13 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2017-02-16 15:02:29 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Fundal pressure during the second stage of labour (also known as the 'Kristeller manoeuvre') involves application of manual pressure to the uppermost part of the uterus directed towards the birth canal, in an attempt to assist spontaneous vaginal birth and avoid prolonged second stage or the need for operative birth.

Fundal pressure by an inflatable belt during the second stage of labour may shorten duration of second stage for nulliparous women, and lower rates of operative birth. However, existing studies are small and their generalizability is uncertain. There is insufficient evidence regarding safety for the baby. There is no evidence on the use of fundal pressure in specific clinical settings such as inability of the mother to bear down due to exhaustion or unconsciousness. There is currently insufficient evidence for the routine use of fundal pressure by any method on women in the second stage of labour. Because of current widespread use of the procedure and the potential for use in settings where other methods of assisted birth are not available, further good quality trials are needed. Further evaluation in other groups of women (such as multiparous women) will also be required. Future research should describe in detail how fundal pressure was applied and consider safety of the unborn baby, perineal outcomes, longer-term maternal and infant outcomes and maternal satisfaction.</P></ABS_CONCLUSIONS></ABSTRACT><BODY MODIFIED="2017-02-17 09:10:25 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2017-02-16 14:02:53 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><CONDITION MODIFIED="2017-02-15 15:51:19 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>The second stage of labour is defined as the period of time from full dilation of the cervix until complete expulsion of the baby (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2016</LINK>). This includes the time when the mother bears down to give birth. The duration of second stage is generally longer in nulliparous women than multiparous women, however a prolonged second stage (whether due to maternal or fetal factors) can require urgent intervention to improve perinatal outcome.</P><P>The purpose of fundal pressure is to shorten the second stage of labour. The clinical indications for this manoeuvre can be fetal distress, failure to progress in the second stage of labour and/or maternal exhaustion or medical conditions whereby (prolonged) pushing is contraindicated, for example, maternal heart disease (<LINK REF="REF-Cosner-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cosner 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Simpson-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Simpson 2001</LINK>).</P></CONDITION><INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2017-02-16 14:02:53 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Fundal pressure during the second stage of labour is a controversial manoeuvre. The obstetric technique involves application of manual pressure to the uppermost part of the uterus directed towards the birth canal in an attempt to shorten the second stage (<LINK REF="REF-Kline_x002d_Kaye-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kline-Kaye 1990</LINK>). In research settings, fundal pressure has also been applied using an inflatable belt.</P><P>The practice varies greatly between countries. Manual fundal pressure is frequently used in settings where other interventions, like instrumental deliveries, are not readily available, or cannot be performed because of professional staff shortage. While in many low- and middle-income countries the manoeuvre appears to be routine practice during vaginal births (<LINK REF="REF-Goldman-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goldman 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Miller-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Miller 2003</LINK>), in some, mainly English-speaking, Western countries, it is seen as an obsolete procedure (<LINK REF="REF-Alran-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alran 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Buhimschi-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Buhimschi 2002</LINK>). In the USA and the UK for example, this may be because of the intense medico-legal climate in those countries, and the complications supposedly arising from the manoeuvre, as described below. These factors may also contribute to under-reporting. A postpartum follow-up survey in the USA in 2005 found that 17% of the respondents had experienced fundal pressure during the second stage of their birth (<LINK REF="REF-Declercq-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Declercq 2006</LINK>). In 4% of all vaginal births between 1994 and 1995 in the Netherlands, fundal pressure was recorded (<LINK REF="REF-De-Leeuw-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">De Leeuw 2001</LINK>). A study in Austria found the manoeuvre being practiced in up to 23% of vaginal births in the university hospital (<LINK REF="STD-Schulz_x002d_Lobmeyr-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Schulz-Lobmeyr 1999</LINK>). In a Swedish study, fundal pressure was used in 11% of vacuum-assisted births (<LINK REF="REF-Ahlberg-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ahlberg 2016</LINK>). In a Japanese survey, all responding institutions reported using fundal pressure in accordance with the Japan Academy of Midwifery 2012 Evidence-Based Guidelines for Midwifery Care (<LINK REF="REF-Baba-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baba 2016</LINK>). A United Nations Population Fund study of childbirth practices and experiences in rural central Bangladesh found the use of fundal pressure and tight abdominal bands to be prevalent (<LINK REF="REF-Goodburn-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goodburn 1995</LINK>). A Brazilian survey found that fundal pressure was used more frequently in labours attended by physicians than those attended by nurse-midwives (<LINK REF="REF-Gama-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gama 2016</LINK>).</P></INTERVENTION><THEORY MODIFIED="2017-01-09 09:22:50 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>There is little evidence to demonstrate that the use of fundal pressure is effective in shortening the second stage. A study in the US examining intrauterine pressure found that fundal pressure during the contraction increased the expulsive force on average by 28%. The authors go on to suggest that fundal pressure may reduce the risks associated with either a prolonged second stage or the resulting operative procedures (<LINK REF="REF-Buhimschi-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Buhimschi 2002</LINK>). However, an observational study found the second stage to be longer in those cases where fundal pressure was used (<LINK REF="REF-Cosner-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cosner 1996</LINK>). This may reflect selection bias rather than failure of the procedure, as fundal pressure would tend to be used in the more difficult deliveries.</P><P>More relevant than the effect of fundal pressure on length of second stage is its effect on maternal and neonatal outcomes. Several reports suggest that fundal pressure is associated with maternal and neonatal complications, for example, uterine rupture (<LINK REF="REF-Pan-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pan 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sturzenegger-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sturzenegger 2016</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vangeenderhuysen-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vangeenderhuysen 2002</LINK>), neonatal fractures and brain damage (<LINK REF="REF-Amiel_x002d_Tyson-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Amiel-Tyson 1988</LINK>). An increased risk of anal sphincter damage has been reported (<LINK REF="REF-Cosner-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cosner 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-De-Leeuw-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">De Leeuw 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zetterstrom-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zetterstrom 1999</LINK>). Confounding factors, including birthweight, length of second stage, and malpresentation, which could have influenced the birth attendant's decision to perform fundal pressure, are not corrected for in these observational studies. On the other hand, if fundal pressure could prevent instrumental birth, the risk of a third-degree tear as a result of the instrument used would also be decreased.</P><P>Another concern is that fundal pressure might increase feto-maternal or maternal-fetal transfusion. No evidence has been found of increased transfusion of blood from mother to baby during external cephalic version, which also involves manual pressure on the uterus (<LINK REF="REF-Holmes-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Holmes 2004</LINK>). Fundal pressure at the time of caesarean section does not increase the amount of transplacental micro transfusion (<LINK REF="REF-Owens-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Owens 2003</LINK>).

There are five trials of manual fundal pressure and four trials of use of inflatable belts. We found limited evidence, which does not currently support the routine use of fundal pressure in clinical settings, either manually or by inflatable belt. There is still uncertainty around the majority of outcomes due to substantial heterogeneity, inconsistent findings and insufficient data.</P><SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-02-16 09:25:46 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="4">Manual fundal pressure versus no fundal pressure</HEADING><P>(See <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>)</P><P>Neither mode of birth (vaginal, instrumental or caesarean birth) or time to birth was affected by applying manual fundal pressure to women in second stage of labour. Perineal damage may be more likely for women receiving fundal pressure but this result may be due to chance; other types of soft tissue damage were not reported in included trials. In the single trial that reported pain felt by the women, postnatal pain was increased in the fundal pressure group. Maternal satisfaction was not reported in included trials.</P><P>Apgar scores were higher in the babies born to women who did not receive fundal pressure - this may indicate that manual fundal pressure results in poorer outcomes for babies, but this finding is not conclusive, with wide confidence intervals that cross the line of no effect. There were no fractures, haematomas or deaths reported in this comparison. Of note, the Gentle Assisted Pushing method of applying fundal pressure was not associated with a difference in neonatal outcomes between the two groups. Further research could establish whether this technique is more effective and safer than other forms of fundal pressure.</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="4">Fundal pressure by inflatable belt versus no fundal pressure</HEADING><P>(See <LINK REF="SOF-02" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 2</LINK>)</P><P>Rates of instrumental birth and operative deliveries overall were lower in the inflatable belt group, although we cannot be certain that this result is not due to chance due to wide confidence intervals. Results were also inconsistent for caesarean section, possibly due to differences in study design. Duration of second stage labour was substantially shorter for the women when the inflatable belt was used. Perineal, vaginal and cervical tears were not clearly different between the two groups, however one study found an increase in third degree tears in the inflatable belt group. Generally, women reported that they were satisfied with the belt.</P><P>The possible increase in intact perineum, as well as in anal sphincter tears in women wearing the belt, is somewhat contradictory. While in the belt group, 16 of 17 cases of sphincter tears were associated with an instrumental birth, in the control group an instrumental birth was only associated with one third-degree tear. The belt was switched off prior to instrumentation in the trial that collected these data. It seems therefore unlikely that there is a causative relation between the intervention and the tears. The trial authors reported their suspicion that the outcome assessors were more diligent in identifying and reporting perineal trauma in the experimental group. The lack of blinding seem to have introduced bias for assessment of this outcome. However, the possibility of a causal link should not be discounted.</P><P>Numbers of babies with low arterial cord pH, low Apgar scores, and admissions to neonatal intensive care, were similar across the groups. One baby had a cephalhaematoma in the control group.

Longer-term maternal outcomes were also not reported. Only five trials reported any type of soft tissue damage including vaginal and perineal tears of any degree of severity. Neonatal outcomes were even less well reported in the inflatable belt comparison. Only one trial reported Apgar score and low arterial cord pH. It is therefore difficult to draw conclusions on the benefits and harms on the use of fundal pressure, and whether the findings are generalisable to other settings or groups of women.</P><P>The trials took place in a range of countries, however, the majority of trials were poorly conducted or poorly reported.

The 3 chambers of the belt can be inflated individually in order to reposition the fetus. These chambers are filled according to the pressures set by the operator (midwife or clinician) and allow gentle positioning of the fetus in the correct position toward the pelvis. Once the correct fetal position has been attained, all 3 chambers are inflated synchronously during uterine contraction. The maternal and fetal heart monitoring unit comprises a medical touch-screen computer that records electro-physiologic signals collected by a medical signal amplifier deriving from the mother (uterine contractions and maternal heart rate) and the fetus (fetal heart rate). There is also the possibility to record Doppler parameters of the fetal heart from the cardiotocograph.&#8220;</P><P><B>27 out of 40 women in the low pressure group had Kristeller manoeuvre.</B></P></CHAR_NOTES></INCLUDED_CHAR><INCLUDED_CHAR MODIFIED="2017-02-16 12:31:39 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]" STUDY_ID="STD-Acmaz-2015"><CHAR_METHODS MODIFIED="2017-02-16 12:29:39 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Prospective randomised controlled trial.

read with interest the review titled "Fundal pressure during the second stage of labour for improving maternal and fetal outcomes" published in Chocrane library, by Hofmeyr G, Vogel JP, Cuthbert A, Singata M, (1) and disappointment on the methodology used raised.</P><P>In this review, the authors compare the clinical results of 2 parturient groups:</P><P>Group of parturient in which the manual "Kristeller / Fundal Pressure" maneuver is performed "VS" manual control group without Kristeller / Fundal Pressure AND "Delivery" group to which the "Kristeller maneuver (KM) with AN " INFLATABLE BELT" is performed -VS control group without Kristeller maneuver.</P><P>The authors of the Cochrane Review assume that this comparison is necessary to understand if the Kristeller Maneuver /Fundal Pressure (FP), widely used in labor floor, is of some use or, as reported in the literature is not useful or even harmful.</P><P>The conclusions are still doubtful on the effect of the so-called KM / FP, which requires studies of better quality: the so-called manual KM does not affect the percentage of vaginal deliveries. In fact, only one trial reports the need for an increase in the need for relief from pain and that infants have an Apgar score &lt;7 at 5 min; there is not enough evidence that it is safe for the newborn. The KM with AN INFLATABLE BELT reduces the second stage of labor and can increase the percentage of spontaneous deliveries, even if the available evidence is not conclusive. There is not enough evidence that it is safe for the baby and is not safe either on the perineum.</P><P>Maternal and fetal clinical effects of the so called MK / FP manual through randomized trials, are studies that might give conclusive information on the beneficial or dangerous outcomes. Given the potential role of the so-called MK / FP manual where operative deliveries are not used for lack of instruments, trials are necessary in developing countries and should be performed also in multipara.</P><P>Comments:</P><P>Kristeller maneuver in its true origin was an accompaniment from the outside to uterine contractions. In all cases Samuel Kristeller recorded the number and duration of the accompaniment of the contractions uterine with the hands, during the whole expulsion period, with the maximum technologies of the time available, that was a clock. In many cases Samuel Kristeller also measured the amount of pressure in Kg that was needed to give birth to the fetus through a forceps with dynamometer. Therefore, since the authors of the Cochrane Review cite Samuel Kristeller comparing the Fundal Pressure to the so-called Kristeller maneuver, we highlight how this is scientifically incorrect for the reasons given above. In this regard Next we will call the current way of practicing fundal pressure: "kristeller maneuver".</P><P>The authors confuse the prevention of maternal-fetal-neonatal risks and complications which are generated by the delays of assistance in childbirth often lead to use in emergency conditions and in need of caesarean section during labor, that the healthcare staff is used to dealing with the so - called KRISTELLER 'S MANEUVER /FP with the TRUE prevention of these clinical conditions through a CONTROLLED AND MEASURED accompaniment of uterine contractions performed using a device with CE certificate equipped with an ergonomic inflatable belt. (2)Therefore the effects of the INFLATABLE BELT of Baby Guard studied according to ergonomics and biomechanics and engineered principles just to redesign the times and ways of labor AND delivery and therefore avoid them clinical conditions of risk that then induce to use the Kristeller maneuver, show that the technical and scientific principles published in the Baby Guard study. Moreover this article has been selected as a publication in the analysis of meta-analysis but being the owner of the database the authors have never ever asked for the data. At this point the question is simple: how the authors may perform a meta-analysis without having our data?</P><P>The authors' statements about the application of Kristeller's maneuver/FP are questionable as the data presented as real lacks of actual verification on their demonstration since the Kristeller's maneuver /FP is practiced manually and it is NOT possible to establish to what pressure it is applied, and therefore in the various studies chosen in the review there is no control and verification of the pressure exerted. Because the INFLATABLE BELT related to the Baby Guard study is inserted into an electromechanical system [that also detects the electro-physiologic signals of myographic uterine activity from the maternal abdomen , i.e. fetal and maternal heart signals] that allows recording of the measurement and control of the pressure administered to the parturient , to the fetus and the newborn, all of them recordings are documented and verifiable retrospectively even for medical reasons.</P><P>The study of the INFLATABLE BELT OF BABY GUARD are determined from an analysis of the ORIGINAL publication of Samuel Kristeller and analysis of the criticalities due to the lack of Ergonomic processes that allowed a correct accompanying direction contractions; the 3 chambers that have facilitated the positioning of the fetus, the INFLATABLE BELT size and biomechanical engineering improvements made by means of a correct direction of accompaniment contractions . The 3 chambers that facilitated the positioning of the fetus, the INFLATABLE BELT size and biomechanical engineering improvements, made through the TECHNICAL evaluations of the "Labor Assister" tool, that is the Korean BELT.</P><P>Therefore it is a very serious methodological error to combine the results of 2 belts/instruments used in the studies cited by the Cochrane Review designed and engineered with different technicians principles one of which (Baby Guard) is the one that thanks to the improvements obtained.</P><P>A proof of the importance of the fact that the INFLATABLE BELT relative to the study by Baby Guard is differentiates from the belts of the other studies cited by the Cochrane Review and 'why' the belt of the study on Baby Guard and equipped with CB certificate on risk analysis, and that after obtaining the CE certification the same SSR Toscana has in more studies and even in a tender contract purchased the MEDICAL DEVICE Baby Guard for the measured and controlled accompaniment of uterine contractions in order to eliminate the use of the MK / FP cd , the second methodological error is to compare 2 BELTS , although technically different, however both with the aim of eliminating the so-called MK / FP, with a practice that instead both the above mentioned BELTS had as their purpose its elimination and that is the c.d MK / FP.</P><P>Without risk analysis and consequently without the assessment of the pressure exerted on the fetus and newborn child is impossible scientifically and clinically to exclude that an adverse event and sentinel NOT was caused by the risk factor regardless of whether the customizations of the pressure exerted are called "Gentle Assisted Pushing technique (GAP)" [among the Authors DI GAP there are Hofmeyr G, Singata M : which have conflicts of interests in writing this review] or c.d. MK / FP in as both do not allow measurability and pressure control administered.</P><P>The negative or positive effects of a pressure exerted by an operator on parturient, fetus / newborn can only be determined through an analysis of the risks that can through the control and measurement of the pressure exerted establish the correct amount of pressure and consequently verify its effects preventing maternal and fetal complications.</P><P>In fact it is scientifically proven that the international literature relating to studies with the BELTS establishes up to 200 millibar of pressure the parturient the fetus and newborn NOT cause changes in maternal / fetal / neonatal health conditions whereas it is scientifically proven that if the operator diligently follows the clinical instructions of use of the BELT and MEDICAL DEVICE Baby Guard are prevented in statistically significant maternal / fetus / neonatal complications during the labor and delivery. While it is scientifically proven that to practice c.d MK/FP a pressure of 30 kg must be used.</P><P>References</P><OL><LI>Hofmeyr GJ, Vogel JP, Cuthbert A, Singata M.

We recognize that there may be differences in effectiveness of different designs of inflatable belts. Where the results of studies of different belt designs were inconsistent (heterogeneous), we used a random effects model in the meta-analysis. The data for the trials of different belt designs are available in the review so that readers can access data on specific belt designs.</LI><LI>We agree that risk factors requiring fundal pressure or belt application may be responsible for bad outcomes rather than the procedure. For this reason our review is restricted to randomized trials in which risk factors in the intervention group and the control group are balanced by the randomization process.</LI><LI>We have declared our conflicts of interest (participation of some of the review team in studies of manual fundal pressure).
