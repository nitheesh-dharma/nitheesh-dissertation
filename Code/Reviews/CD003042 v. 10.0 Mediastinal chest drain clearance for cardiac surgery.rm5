<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Chest tubes are required following cardiac surgery to drain blood from around the heart. Blood around the heart can interfere with the function of the heart (cardiac tamponade) and result in more surgery and in extreme cases, death. To prevent chest tubes from blocking and so causing tamponade nurses manipulate them to prevent or remove clots. Manipulation may cause pain and discomfort for cardiac patients and rarely other adverse effects. This review found there was not enough evidence to say if one method of manipulation is better than another, or that manipulation is needed.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2010-05-25 15:19:08 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Joey Kwong">
<P>Mediastinal chest drains (including pericardial drains) are inserted as standard post-operative practice following cardiac surgery to assist the clearance of blood from the pericardial space and to prevent cardiac tamponade. Cardiac tamponade is a potentially life threatening complication that may arise after cardiac surgery. Cardiac tamponade results from blood or fluid collecting in the pericardial space compressing the heart and reducing cardiac output (<LINK REF="REF-Bloedel-Smith-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bloedel Smith 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Isaacson-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Isaacson 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McLaughlin-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">McLaughlin 1996</LINK>). Drainage tubes, therefore, must remain clear and open to allow free flow of collected fluid. The mediastinal chest drainage system uses under-water seal and low pressure suction to augment the drainage process. In addition to continuous low suction the tubes may be manipulated to enhance the drainage of fluid and to clear clots which form in the drainage system. Manipulation methods include milking, stripping, fanfolding and tapping. Milking, stripping and fanfolding increases the negative pressure of the system (<LINK REF="STD-Duncan-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Duncan 1982</LINK>), which is believed to enhance drainage and clot clearance capabilities. The increased negative pressure, however, may be harmful. There has been one report of an avulsed coronary vein through the eyelets of a chest tube during stripping (<LINK REF="REF-Fishman-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fishman 1983</LINK>) and concern has been raised about the effects of increasing the pressure on the myocardium and on haemodynamic variables (<LINK REF="STD-Duncan-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Duncan 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pierce-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Pierce 1991</LINK>). Manipulation of chest tubes may cause pain and discomfort for cardiac patients.<BR/>
<BR/>The potential for harm resulting from chest tube manipulation needs to be balanced with the necessity to prevent clot formation in the tube from interfering with the drainage process. Evidence is required as to the safest and most effective means of preventing chest tube blockage and preventing cardiac tamponade. There appears to be no definitive evidence as to whether chest tube manipulation is more effective than suction alone or which form of manipulation should be used. Further there is no evidence as to whether tube manipulation should be applied routinely or only when tubes are blocked (<LINK REF="STD-Isaacson-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Isaacson 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lim_x002d_Levy-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Lim-Levy 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pierce-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Pierce 1991</LINK>). There does not even appear to be consensus regarding the definition of the various forms of manipulation. Stripping for instance may be done with the fingers (<LINK REF="STD-Isaacson-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Isaacson 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lim_x002d_Levy-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Lim-Levy 1986</LINK>) or a hand held roller (<LINK REF="STD-Duncan-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Duncan 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pierce-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Pierce 1991</LINK>). Milking, on the other hand, is even less well defined and some authors include fanfolding as a milking method (<LINK REF="STD-Isaacson-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Isaacson 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lim_x002d_Levy-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Lim-Levy 1986</LINK>) whilst another author refers to fanfolding as a type of stripping method (<LINK REF="STD-Duncan-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Duncan 1982</LINK>). Information about the method involved in tube manipulation, for example the length of the tube which should be used in the manipulation, is not available or is inconsistent between authors (<LINK REF="REF-Bloedel-Smith-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bloedel Smith 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Isaacson-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Isaacson 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McLaughlin-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">McLaughlin 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>A systematic review of the research literature was indicated, given the lack of definitive guidelines for practice in this area of critical care.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Definitions</HEADING>
<P>There appears to be no consistency in the literature as to the definition of chest tube manipulation methods. For the purposes of this systematic review, the definitions given by the authors of included studies were categorised according to the following:</P>
<P>Stripping involves using either the fingers or a hand-held roller to compress a length of tubing, moving proximally to distally whilst maintaining the compression. One hand grips the proximal tube with the thumb and forefinger and the other hand grips the tube immediately distally. The distal thumb and finger then apply firm constant pressure whilst moving along a length of tubing. Further lengths of tubing may be stripped by maintaining the pressure of the distal finger and thumb whilst the proximal hand moves immediately proximal and adjacent to the distal hand then the distal hand repeats the stripping action along the tube (<LINK REF="STD-Isaacson-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Isaacson 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pierce-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Pierce 1991</LINK>). It is proposed that this action produces negative pressure which draws fluid and clots out of the chest.Milking is defined as compression of the tube using twisting or squeezing (sometimes hand-over-hand) to move fluid within the tube. Fanfolding involves folding sections of the tube over each other and squeezing. It is proposed that milking and fan folding produce some positive pressure during the twisting, squeezing or fanfolding/squeezing process followed by negative pressure when the tubing is released (<LINK REF="STD-Duncan-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Duncan 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Isaacson-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Isaacson 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lim_x002d_Levy-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Lim-Levy 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pierce-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Pierce 1991</LINK>). Tapping is a gentle rhythmical tapping of the chest tube with forceps to facilitate drainage of blood down the narrow section of the chest tube.</P>

<P>Three studies (471 participants) were included, see <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>. Of the three studies there was no data which could be included in a meta-analysis. This was due to inadequate data provision by two of the studies (<LINK REF="STD-Isaacson-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Isaacson 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lim_x002d_Levy-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Lim-Levy 1986</LINK>). Contact was made with both these authors but neither were able to provide any additional data. In addition, where adequate data were provided there were no common interventions or outcomes to pool.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Isaacson-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Isaacson 1986</LINK> studied 211 participants, comparing fanfolding with stripping and measuring volume of drainage and numbers of deaths. The data from this study could not be included in a meta-analysis because no variance was provided for the continuous variable (amount of drainage) and the mortality data (n=3) was not presented by experimental group. Although the author was contacted, she was unable to provide the missing data.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Lim_x002d_Levy-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Lim-Levy 1986</LINK> studied 60 participants comparing routine stripping or fanfolding with a control group which received standard suction pressure but no tube manipulation. This report did not provide variance for variables using continuous data (8-hour drainage volume and heart rate over study period). There were two other binary outcomes: incidence of tube blockage and incidence of arrhythmias. The data for incidence of arrhythmias was not reported by group and therefore could not be included. Although the author was contacted, she was unable to provide the missing data.</P>
<P>The other included study of 200 adults following myocardial revascularization surgery compared milking and stripping (<LINK REF="STD-Pierce-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Pierce 1991</LINK>). Milking or stripping was instituted once a clot was evident and ceased once the clot was removed. This study measured a number of variables and provided adequate data for these.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2010-05-25 16:17:40 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The purpose of this review was to compare different methods of chest drain clearance (i.e. varying levels of suction or suction in combination with milking, stripping, fanfolding and tapping of chest drains) in preventing cardiac tamponade in patients following cardiac surgery. Only three studies were eligible for inclusion, and of these, data were only available from two studies to include in a meta-analysis. In addition, these studies had no common interventions or outcomes which could be pooled in a meta-analysis. No significant differences were reported for any of the outcomes across any of the interventions, except <LINK REF="STD-Lim_x002d_Levy-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Lim-Levy 1986</LINK> who reported (but did not provide data) that the stripping group had a greater drainage volume than the fanfolding or control group.</P>
<P>There is no real evidence, therefore, to make any conclusions regarding the efficacy of one type of chest tube manipulation compared to another. There was no difference in the incidence of chest tube blockage or heart rate when stripping and fanfolding methods were compared (<LINK REF="STD-Lim_x002d_Levy-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Lim-Levy 1986</LINK>) or in the incidence of cardiac tamponade or surgical re-entry when milking and stripping were compared (<LINK REF="STD-Pierce-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Pierce 1991</LINK>). The strongest of the three included studies by Pierce (<LINK REF="STD-Pierce-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Pierce 1991</LINK>) had a low risk of bias, total subject numbers of 200 and concluded that there is no difference between milking and stripping in benefit or harm to patients. Pierce, however, followed up patients for only eight hours and manipulation was provided as a clot became evident. There is a need for more methodologically rigorous studies to be done in this area.</P>
<P>There is no evidence, in fact, as to whether there is a need to manipulate chest drains at all. Although <LINK REF="STD-Lim_x002d_Levy-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Lim-Levy 1986</LINK> included a control group, the study was considered to have a moderate risk of bias, it only reported frequency of tube occlusion and gave some information about differences in the amount of drainage between groups. It has been reported that tube manipulation increases negative pressure (<LINK REF="STD-Duncan-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Duncan 1982</LINK>) and that this excessive pressure may be detrimental. Also, chest tube manipulation can be a painful procedure in patients following cardiac surgery. Therefore, as chest tube manipulation is a commonly used practice which may be associated with adverse events there seems an imperative to conduct research which tests the need for chest tube manipulation techniques compared to a control group in large, methodologically rigorous studies.</P>
<P>There are a number of considerations in doing the suggested research. Firstly, the definition of tube manipulation in the studies needs to be explicit and objective. As pointed out in the background to this review there is not a clear and universal definition for the various procedures. This was also evident in the included studies. For example, <LINK REF="STD-Isaacson-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Isaacson 1986</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Lim_x002d_Levy-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Lim-Levy 1986</LINK> reported they used milking as one chest tube manipulation method. In both these studies milking included a description of fanfolding methods. <LINK REF="STD-Pierce-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Pierce 1991</LINK>, however, described their milking intervention as involving a "twisting or squeezing motion" (p126). In addition to comparing various means of tube clearance there is potential to compare routine versus "as needs" intervention. <LINK REF="STD-Isaacson-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Isaacson 1986</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Lim_x002d_Levy-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Lim-Levy 1986</LINK> for instance followed a protocol of routine clearance whereas in Pierce 's study tubes were manipulated when a clot became evident. Finally, future research would benefit by collecting comprehensive, well-defined, reliable, valid and longer term outcomes. Cardiac tamponade, indicators of impending cardiac tamponade, and the need for surgical re-entry and other interventions need to be measured. Follow up should extend past the critical phase to ensure adequate collection of outcomes. The value of measuring volume of drainage needs to be carefully considered.</P>
<P>A secondary objective of this review was to analyse the results for children. There were, however, no studies including children. The size of the tubes used with children may necessitate different management strategies in response to clot clearance and the negative pressures generated. The research recommended above (i.e.. comparing different methods of chest drain clearance with each other and with a control, and manipulating tube on an as-required versus routine basis) is recommended for children also.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>There are insufficient studies which compare differing methods of chest drain clearance to support or refute the relative efficacy of the various methods in preventing cardiac tamponade. Nor can the need to manipulate chest drains be supported or refuted by results from RCT's.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Studies are needed that adequately define chest drain manipulation, compare methods applied either routinely or as required, compare methods with each other and with a control and include adequate outcomes followed up past the acute phase. Other forms of drainage could also be compared with standard chest drains in prevention of complications following cardiac surgery, for example redon catheters (<LINK REF="REF-Farhat-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Farhat 2003</LINK>), flexible fluted silicon drains (<LINK REF="REF-Akowuah-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Akowuah 2002</LINK>) and phosphatidylcholine-coated chest tubes (<LINK REF="REF-Hunter-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hunter 1993</LINK>).</P>
