<P>Postpartum depression is a serious condition of significant public health importance. The purpose of this review was to examine the effect of psychosocial and psychological interventions to reduce the risk of postpartum depression compared with usual care. This review includes data from 28 randomised controlled trials involving almost 17,000 women. The preventative interventions evaluated in the included trials were diverse and the end-points differed widely but the methodological quality was good to excellent. A clear beneficial effect in the prevention of postpartum depression was found from a range of psychosocial and psychological interventions. Promising interventions included professionally-based postpartum home visits, lay- or peer-based postpartum telephone support, and interpersonal psychotherapy. Interventions provided by various health professionals and lay individuals were similarly beneficial. Interventions that were individually-based were beneficial as were those that involved multiple contacts. There is also evidence that interventions initiated postnatally assisted in preventing postpartum depression as were those specifically targeting 'at-risk' mothers. Many questions remain unanswered and additional research is needed.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-12-20 11:20:09 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Twenty-eight trials, involving almost 17,000 women, contributed data to the review. Overall, women who received a psychosocial or psychological intervention were significantly less likely to develop postpartum depression compared with those receiving standard care (average RR 0.78, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.66 to 0.93; 20 trials, 14,727 women). Several promising interventions include: (1) the provision of intensive, individualised postpartum home visits provided by public health nurses or midwives (RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.73; two trials, 1262 women); (2) lay (peer)-based telephone support (RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.38 to 0.77; one trial, 612 women); and (3) interpersonal psychotherapy (standardised mean difference -0.27, 95% CI -0.52 to -0.01; five trials, 366 women). Professional- and lay-based interventions were both effective in reducing the risk to develop depressive symptomatology. Individually-based interventions reduced depressive symptomatology at final assessment (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.61 to 0.92; 14 trials, 12,914 women) as did multiple-contact interventions (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.66 to 0.93; 16 trials, 11,850 women). Interventions that were initiated in the postpartum period also significantly reduced the risk to develop depressive symptomatology (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.59 to 0.90; 12 trials, 12,786 women). Identifying mothers 'at-risk' assisted the prevention of postpartum depression (RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.50 to 0.88; eight trials, 1853 women).<BR/>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2012-12-20 12:26:09 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Depression is a major cause of disability for all ages and both sexes worldwide (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2010</LINK>). The public health significance of depression in women is undeniable, with lifetime rates between 10% and 25% (<LINK REF="REF-Kessler-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kessler 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Weissman-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weissman 1996</LINK>). According to the World Health Organization, by 2020 depression is projected to carry the highest disease burden of all health conditions in women, accounting for 5.7% of the total disease burden measured in disability-adjusted life years. Depression impairs social and physical functioning, is a major precipitating factor in suicide, and is associated with healthcare costs, morbidity, and mortality from medical illness. For women aged 15 to 44, depression is the leading cause of non-obstetric hospitalisations among women in the United States (<LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Hara-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Hara 2009</LINK>). Postpartum depression is often defined as depression occurring within the first year following childbirth. In most studies this includes those women for whom the depression may be a continuation of that experienced during pregnancy, as well as those for whom it is a new onset. The <I>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</I> (DSM-IV) does not recognise postpartum depression as diagnostically distinct from depression at other times, although does allow for the addition of a "postpartum-onset specifier" in women with an onset within four weeks of birth.  Results from a meta-analysis of postpartum depression in 59 studies found an overall prevalence of 13% within the first 12 weeks following childbirth (n = 12,810; 95% confidence interval 12.3% to 13.4%)(<LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Hara-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Hara 1996</LINK>). A more recent systematic review of postpartum depression found the period prevalence of all depression to be 19.2% in the first 12 weeks postnatally, with a period prevalence for major depression of 7.1% (<LINK REF="REF-Gaynes-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gaynes 2005</LINK>). This review also identified depression to be common during pregnancy with a period prevalence of 18.4% across the nine months of pregnancy, with 12.7% having an episode of major depression during this time. Not surprisingly, antenatal depression is a strong risk factor of postpartum depression. For the majority of women, postpartum depression starts within the first 12 weeks postpartum and common symptoms include dysphoria, emotional lability, insomnia, confusion, guilt, and suicidal ideation. For about 8% of mothers, their depressive symptoms will continue past the first year postpartum (<LINK REF="REF-Dennis-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dennis 2012</LINK>). If left untreated, postpartum depression can develop into severe clinical depression and, in a small number of cases, lead to suicide, which is one of the leading causes of maternal deaths in the UK (<LINK REF="REF-Lewis-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lewis 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lindahl-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lindahl 2005</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2012-12-20 12:26:16 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The cause of postpartum depression suggests a multifactorial aetiology (<LINK REF="REF-Beck-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beck 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Hara-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Hara 1996</LINK>). Despite considerable research, no single causative factor has been isolated. However, meta-analytic findings consistently highlight the importance of psychosocial variables such as stressful life events, marital conflict, and the lack of social support. To address this issue, a variety of psychosocial and psychological interventions have been developed to treat postpartum depression (<LINK REF="REF-Dennis-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dennis 2007</LINK>). For example, randomised controlled trials evaluating cognitive-behavioural counselling with antidepressants (<LINK REF="REF-Appleby-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Appleby 1997</LINK>), cognitive-behavioural therapy and non-directive counselling (<LINK REF="REF-Cooper-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cooper 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cooper-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cooper 2003</LINK>), health visitor-led non-directive counselling (<LINK REF="REF-Holden-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Holden 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wickberg-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wickberg 1996</LINK>), peer support (<LINK REF="REF-Dennis-2003a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dennis 2003a</LINK>), and interpersonal psychotherapy (<LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Hara-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Hara 2000</LINK>) have all demonstrated the amenability of postpartum depression to treatment. It is theoretically plausible that psychosocial and psychological interventions may also prevent postpartum depression, as many of the known risk factors are present during pregnancy and the immediate postpartum period. As such, these interventions may be provided to women antenatally or initiated early in the postpartum period. They may be individually-based focusing on specific maternal needs or provided in a group setting that could incorporate peer support from other women and social comparisons. Interventions may be intensive and include multiple contacts or be provided during a single session. Interventions may also be provided by a health professional, such as a midwife, nurse, psychologist, or lay individuals such as experienced mothers recruited from the community. The usefulness of any intervention to prevent postpartum depression, at a population level, depends on the proportion of depressed women who would have been identified to be at risk and offered the intervention (sensitivity of risk targeting). The cost-effectiveness will depend crucially on the proportion of women who would have developed postpartum depression amongst those identified to be at risk (positive predictive value of risk targeting). One way to identify those at increased risk of developing postpartum depression is to use a risk screening tool. A simpler approach is to target individual risk groups. Although there are unique circumstances in the perinatal period that might increase risk of depression, such as obstetric and neonatal complications, the risk factors identified by most studies are similar to those for depression at other times such as a past history of psychopathology, antenatal depression or anxiety, a poor relationship with partner, low social support, and stressful life events (<LINK REF="REF-Beck-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beck 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Hara-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Hara 1996</LINK>). There are also specific subgroups of women who are at high risk, e.g. those with a history of abuse (emotional, physical, sexual) (<LINK REF="REF-Ross-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ross 2009</LINK>), young mothers (<LINK REF="REF-Brown-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brown 2011</LINK>), and migrant groups (<LINK REF="REF-Collins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Collins 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>It is anticipated that the psychosocial and psychological interventions may reduce the risk for postpartum depression via several mechanisms (<LINK REF="REF-Cohen-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cohen 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Dennis-2003b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dennis 2003b</LINK>). These interventions can <I>directly</I> influence the development of postpartum depression by: (1) decreasing isolation and feelings of loneliness, (2) swaying health practices and deterring maladaptive behaviours or responses, (3) promoting positive psychological states and individual motivation, and (4) providing information regarding access to medical services or the benefits of behaviours that positively influence health and well-being. They may also <I>buffer</I> the influence of stress by: (1) redefining and reducing the potential for harm posed by the stressor, (2) broadening the number of coping resources, (3) discussing coping strategies, problem-solving techniques, and counter-responses thereby moderating the initial appraisals of the stressor, (4) highlighting norms through social comparison which prescribe adaptive behaviour, (5) inhibiting maladaptive responses, and (6) counteracting the propensity to blame oneself for causing the stressor or adversity thus preventing active coping efforts to be hampered by self-recriminations. Lastly, psychosocial or psychological interventions may <I>mediate</I> the development of postpartum depression by: (1) assisting in the interpretation and positive reinforcement of performance accomplishments, (2) providing vicarious experience and observational learning through role modelling, (3) offering opportunities for social comparisons to promote self-evaluations and motivation, (4) teaching coping strategies and conveying information about ability, (5) positively interpreting emotional arousal, and (6) encouraging cognitive restructuring through anticipatory guidance.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2012-12-20 12:26:30 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Postpartum depression occurs at a time when the infant is maximally dependent on parental care and is highly sensitive to the quality of the interaction. Concern for infant development is warranted as mood disorders can be incompatible with good parenting interactions and can cause significant stress for children (<LINK REF="REF-England-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">England 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Goodman-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goodman 1999</LINK>). There is a substantial body of evidence showing that maternal depression and subsequent poor maternal-infant interactions adversely affect the developing child (<LINK REF="REF-Weinberg-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weinberg 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Weissman-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weissman 2006</LINK>). Observational research shows that children of depressed mothers, compared with those of non-depressed mothers, are more fussy, receive lower scores on measures of intellectual and motor development, have more difficult temperaments and less secure attachments to their mothers, react more negatively to stress, show delayed development of self-regulatory strategies, and exhibit poorer academic performance, fewer social competencies, lower levels of self-esteem, and higher levels of behavioural problems (<LINK REF="REF-England-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">England 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Goodman-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goodman 1999</LINK>).  A recent meta-analysis, including 193 studies, reported that maternal depression (not restricted to the postnatal period), was associated with higher levels of internalising behaviour, externalising behaviour, general psychopathology and to lower levels of positive affect in the offspring (<LINK REF="REF-Goodman-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goodman 2011</LINK>). Of particular relevance is the observation that these effects were stronger if the child was exposed to maternal depression at an early age. Suggested mechanisms by which maternal-interactions transmit risk from depressed mother to the child include maternal modelling of depressed affect, cognitions, and behaviours; reduced positive reinforcement for the child and inconsistent discipline practices; the development of an insecure child attachment, an indirect influence on maternal depression through its detrimental effects on the marital relationship and family functioning. Not surprisingly, international experts have clearly identified maternal depression as a major childhood adversity and that effective interventions to address this condition are one of the most important public health preventive strategies we can implement to reduce the long-term negative developmental outcomes among children (<LINK REF="REF-England-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">England 2009</LINK>). This review will assist in the development of effective postpartum depression interventions with the aim of reducing the number of women who develop postpartum depression and thus aid in <I>preventing</I> poor child developmental outcomes.</P>

<P>We carried out statistical analysis using the Review Manager software (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2011</LINK>). All trials were considered to include some form of 'talking therapy' and thus eligible to be combined in a meta-analysis. We used fixed-effect meta-analysis for combining data where it was reasonable to assume that the studies were estimating the same underlying treatment effect: i.e., where trials examined similar interventions, and the trials&#8217; populations and methods were judged sufficiently similar. If there was clinical heterogeneity sufficient to expect that the underlying treatment effects differed between trials, or if substantial statistical heterogeneity was detected, we used random-effects meta-analysis to produce an overall summary if an average treatment effect across trials was considered clinically meaningful. The random-effects summary was treated as the average range of possible treatment effects and we discussed the clinical implications of treatment effects differing between trials. If the average treatment effect was not clinically meaningful, we did not combine trials. If we used random-effects analyses, the results were presented as the average treatment effect with its 95% confidence interval, and the estimates of  T² and I².</P>

For trials that used two self-report measures of depression, if one was the EPDS then those data were used. Five trials incorporated a semi-structured diagnostic interview to provide a clinical diagnosis of depression (<LINK REF="STD-Brugha-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Brugha 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dennis-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Dennis 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gorman-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Gorman 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Harris-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Harris 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zlotnick-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Zlotnick 2001</LINK>) with four of these trials using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID).<BR/>
<BR/>The timing of the outcome assessments varied considerably between studies, ranging from three (<LINK REF="STD-Lavender-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Lavender 1998</LINK>) to more than 24 weeks (<LINK REF="STD-Armstrong-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Armstrong 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cupples-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Cupples 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ickovics-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Ickovics 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Le-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Le 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MacArthur-2002" TYPE="STUDY">MacArthur 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Priest-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Priest 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sen-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Sen 2006</LINK>).

<P>Twenty-eight trials, involving almost 17,000 women, were included in the meta-analyses. The results are presented in sequential order, starting with maternal outcomes followed by infant and family outcomes. Because of the large number of outcomes in this review, the following summary of results has been restricted at times to present only final study comparisons. Please refer to the meta-analyses graphs for the full results. According to our pre-specified criteria, there was substantial statistical heterogeneity in many of the outcomes. We report results of random-effects analyses for our main comparison (one) and for other comparisons for those outcomes with statistical heterogeneity. Random-effects analyses provide an estimate of the average treatment effect and effects may differ considerably over different settings. Sensitivity analyses, conducted by removing trials with high likelihood of bias due to either methodological quality or follow-up losses greater than 20%, altered some of the conclusions and these have been noted in the text. Sensitivity analyses were not completed for the clinical diagnosis of depression outcome for any comparison due to small trial numbers. Outcomes were categorised and presented in the results as follows:</P>
<OL>
<LI>zero to eight weeks - immediate effects;</LI>
<LI>nine to 16 weeks - short-term effects;</LI>
<LI>17 to 24 weeks - intermediate effects;</LI>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Main comparison one: all psychosocial and psychological interventions versus usual care - various study outcomes</HEADING>
<P>We considered eight maternal outcomes, three infant outcomes, and one family outcome. Between one and 20 trials contributed to the analyses of each outcome. In this comparison, we combined trials that have evaluated very different types of interventions and thus there could be substantial clinical heterogeneity. To address this, we used random-effects analysis independent of statistical heterogeneity for all outcomes and, in view of this, we would advise caution in the interpretation of results.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Primary outcome: postpartum depression at last study assessment (variously defined)</HEADING>
<P>The main outcome measure for this review was postpartum depression at final study assessment. There was a beneficial effect on the prevention of depressive symptomatology in the meta-analysis of all types of interventions (20 trials, n = 14,727, average risk ratio (RR) 0.78, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.66 to 0.93, I² 64%, T² 0.07, I<SUP>2</SUP> 64%) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>). The standard mean difference (SMD) among trials that provided mean scores was -0.13 (19 trials, n = 12,376, 95% CI -0.28 to 0.01, T<SUP>2</SUP> 0.08, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 91%) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>). For these outcomes we generated funnel plots to investigate possible reporting biases; visual assessment suggested no obvious plot asymmetry (<LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK>; <LINK REF="FIG-04" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 4</LINK>). A significant preventative effect was found among the few studies that included a clinical diagnosis of depression (five trials; n = 939; average RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.78, T<SUP>2</SUP> 0.00, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>). When trials with high susceptibility to bias were temporarily removed (sensitivity analysis related to poor methodological quality or more than 20 loss to follow-up rate), the direction of the effect remained the same for the depressive symptomatology (average RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.91) and also for the SMD in depression scores, although in this case the effect size was reduced when studies at high risk of bias were removed from the analysis (SMD -0.06, 95% CI -0.14 to 0.02) (data not shown).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Primary outcome: postpartum depression at eight, 16, 24 and more than 24 weeks (variously defined)</HEADING>
<P>Results suggested an immediate (13 trials; n = 4,907; average RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.56 to 0.95, I²<SUP> </SUP>61%, T² 0.13) and short-term (10 trials; n = 3982; RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.56 to 0.97, I²<SUP> </SUP>65%, T² 0.11) reduction in depressive symptomatology. The preventative effect appeared to weaken at the intermediate postpartum time period between 17 to 24 weeks (nine trials; n = 10,636; average RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.05, I² 15%, T² 0.01) and was again significant when depressive symptomatology was assessed past 24 weeks postpartum (five trials; n = 2936; average RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.82, I² 1%, T² 0.00) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.4</LINK>). While no statistically significant preventative effect across the postpartum period was found among trials that examined mean depression scores a short-term beneficial effect was found among trials that included a clinical diagnosis of depression (four trials; n = 902; average RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.77,T<SUP>2</SUP> 0.00, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.5</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-001.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.6</LINK>). When sensitivity analyses were performed, the short-term effect in the reduction of depressive symptomatology was strengthened (six trials; n = 1322; RR 0.59, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.75, I² 1%, T² 0) and the difference in means scores became significant (six trials; n = 1061; SMD -0.19, 95% CI -0.31 to -0.07) (data not shown).</P>

Participants in the intervention groups in these trials also had lower mean depression scores (seven trials, n = 1087; SMD -0.13, 95% CI -0.25 to -0.01, I² 0%, T² 0.00) (<LINK REF="CMP-011.07" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 11.7</LINK>) and were less likely to be diagnosed with clinical depression (five trials, n = 939; RR 0.48, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.74, fixed-effect analysis). When sensitivity analyses were performed, the direction of the effect at final study assessment in relation to depressive symptomatology remained the same but the CI widened (five trials, n = 997; RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.35 to 1.02, I² 45%, T² 0.16) (data not shown). The beneficial effect related to a diagnosis with clinical depression disappeared when three out of the five trials (<LINK REF="STD-Brugha-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Brugha 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Harris-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Harris 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zlotnick-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Zlotnick 2001</LINK>) were deemed high risk for bias and were removed from the analysis (two trials, n = 649; RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.36 to 1.15, I² 0%, T² 0.0) (data not shown). Twelve trials enrolled women from the general population. The average RR related to depressive symptomatology at final study assessment was 0.83 (12 trials, n = 12,874; 95% CI 0.68 to 1.02, I² 71%, T² 0.07) (<LINK REF="CMP-011.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 11.6</LINK>) and the SMD was -0.15 (12 trials, n = 11,289; 95% CI -0.33 to 0.04, I² 94%, T² 0.10) (<LINK REF="CMP-011.07" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 11.7</LINK>). There was no strong evidence of differences between these subgroups at final study assessment for depressive symptomatology or mean scores, although there was much greater heterogeneity in the results of studies including women from the general population (I² = 94%) compared with those recruiting women at high-risk only (I² = 0%). Sensitivity analyses did not change any of the final conclusions.<BR/>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2012-12-20 10:30:30 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review summarises the results of 28 trials involving almost 17,000 women, that were conducted in seven countries under a wide variety of circumstances. The methodological quality of the included trials was good to excellent with the most frequently identified weakness being follow-up attrition. In particular, six trials had losses to follow-up greater than 20% with five of these trials collecting outcome data from mailed questionnaires. The removal of trials at risk of bias resulted in minimal changes to any of the conclusions. While intent-to-treat data analyses were performed, several trials involving group sessions had high (<LINK REF="STD-Brugha-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Brugha 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Reid-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Reid 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stamp-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Stamp 1995</LINK>) or unknown (<LINK REF="STD-Tripathy-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Tripathy 2010</LINK>) levels of non-compliance with group attendance. Further, the reporting of the trials was often not comprehensive, lacking in terms of details in the training and qualifications of the intervention providers and in the description of adherence to the intervention protocol. There was also a failure to present details of the informational element of the interventions and on the background features of the care received by the control groups.</P>
<P>In the primary comparison, the diversity of preventative interventions and the widely differing study end-points should urge some caution in the interpretation of the pooled data. To partially address this issue, the meta-analyses included immediate, short, intermediate, and longer-term effects where appropriate. Despite this caution and the subgrouping of end-points, this review has demonstrated that women who received a psychosocial or psychological intervention were significantly less likely to experience postpartum depression than those who received standard care (average risk ratio (RR) 0.78, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.66 to 0.93). Psychosocial (average RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.70 to 0.99) and psychological (average RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.39 to 0.96) interventions were both effective in reducing the risk to develop depressive symptomatology at final study assessment.</P>
<P>Importantly, the review has assisted in specifying what interventions may be effective or not and require further investigation. Although there was no clear evidence of differences between subgroups in trials focusing on different types of psychosocial interventions, antenatal classes addressing postpartum depression have been shown in four trials to have no preventative effect (average RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.32) and cannot be recommended at this time. In four of five trials evaluating in-hospital psychological debriefing there was some evidence of positive effect, but overall, pooled results showed that differences between groups were not statistically significant and more evidence is needed before this intervention is implemented into practice (RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.31 to 1.03).The effectiveness of postpartum lay-based home visits remains uncertain. <LINK REF="STD-Morrell-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Morrell 2000</LINK> demonstrated that the addition of home visits by a community support worker had no protective effect on postpartum depression (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.25). However, a review of the intervention activities revealed that the lay women spent a significant amount of their time providing instrumental support, such as housework and infant care, and limited time providing emotional and appraisal (feedback) support to the mother. The potential to positively influence health outcomes depends on predicting which supportive functions will be the most effective for a particular type of stressor (<LINK REF="REF-Will-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Will 2000</LINK>). In qualitative studies, women from diverse cultures who have suffered from postpartum depression consistently describe their feelings of loneliness, worries about maternal competence, role conflicts, and inability to cope (<LINK REF="REF-Chen-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chen 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nahas-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nahas 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ritter-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ritter 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Small-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Small 1994</LINK>); the presence or absence of instrumental support was not a highlighted factor. The preventative effect of cognitive behavioural therapy also remains uncertain, primarily due to the fact that only one study contributing data to the review (<LINK REF="STD-Le-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Le 2011</LINK>) evaluated this type of intervention. Another trial (<LINK REF="STD-Austin-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Austin 2008</LINK>) also evaluated cognitive behaviour therapy and was included in the review but not the meta-analysis due to the lack of usable data; this study reported no clear differences between intervention and control groups for depression outcomes. Improving the quality of perinatal care provided to women has been another postpartum depression preventative approach. Two trials have evaluated the effect of early postpartum follow-up. Although one quasi-experimental study was not included in this review (<LINK REF="STD-Serwint-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Serwint 1991</LINK>), another well-designed trial demonstrated no beneficial effect on maternal mental health outcomes (<LINK REF="STD-Gunn-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Gunn 1998</LINK>). However, the intervention in this trial did not included a formal assessment of maternal mood during the early postpartum contact. It is well documental that without a formal assessment, most depressive symptomatology remain undetected by primary care health professionals. Three trials evaluated continuity/models of care interventions (<LINK REF="STD-Lumley-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Lumley 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sen-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Sen 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Waldenstrom-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Waldenstrom 2000</LINK>) without demonstrating a preventative effect. The impressive community-based cluster trial by <LINK REF="STD-Lumley-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Lumley 2006</LINK> was particularly comprehensive where the intervention incorporated strategies at both the primary care and community levels. However, the significant changes to the local government implemented by the State government was not the ideal context for a community-based intervention. Replicating multi-component trials like this are warranted.</P>
<P>There is growing evidence to suggest the importance of additional professional-based home visits provided postnatally (RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.73). While one well-designed trial (<LINK REF="STD-Armstrong-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Armstrong 1999</LINK>) suggested intensive nursing home visits with at-risk mothers was protective during the first six weeks postpartum, the beneficial effect was not maintained to 16 weeks. It is noteworthy that the 16-week assessment coincided with a decrease in intervention intensity from weekly to monthly nursing visits. Results from a cluster-randomised controlled trial (<LINK REF="STD-MacArthur-2002" TYPE="STUDY">MacArthur 2002</LINK>) demonstrated that flexible, individualised midwifery-based postpartum care that incorporated postpartum depression screening tools also had a preventive effect. Individualised, telephone-based lay support provided by peers postnatally (<LINK REF="STD-Dennis-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Dennis 2009</LINK>) is another promising intervention (RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.38 to 0.77). Combined, these three trials decreased the risk to develop postpartum depression by almost 50% and provide accumulating evidence that additional individualised support early in the postpartum period is an effective preventative intervention. Another strategy that may assist in preventing postpartum depression is interpersonal psychotherapy (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.27, 95% CI -0.52 to -0.01). Interpersonal psychotherapy is a manual-based, time-limited psychotherapeutic approach with a basic premise that depression, regardless of aetiology, is initiated and maintained within an interpersonal context. The goal of interpersonal psychotherapy is to achieve symptomatic relief for depression by addressing current interpersonal issues associated with its onset or perpetuation; it does not seek to attribute interpersonal problems to underlying personality characteristics or unconscious motivations. Interpersonal psychotherapy is primarily concerned with symptom functioning, presumed to have biological and psychological precipitants, and social functioning. There is a specific focus on social interactions. Given that a lack of support and marital conflict are two strong risk factors for postpartum depression (<LINK REF="REF-Beck-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beck 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Hara-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Hara 1996</LINK>), this intervention is theoretically congruent with preventing postpartum depression.</P>
<P>While there was diversity in the types of intervention provided, most of the trials included in this review incorporated a primary preventative intervention; only one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Dennis-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Dennis 2009</LINK>) selected participants within the first two weeks postpartum based on evidence of beginning depressive symptomatology. According to <LINK REF="REF-Shah-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shah 1998</LINK>, preventative interventions incorporate any strategy that (1) reduces the likelihood of a disease/condition affecting an individual (<I>primary </I>prevention); (2) interrupts or slows the progress of a disease/condition through early detection and treatment (<I>secondary</I> prevention); or (3) slows the progress of a disease/condition and reduces resultant disability through treatment of established disease (<I>tertiary</I> prevention). These preventative interventions can be further classified into different categories depending on the target population: (1) <I>universal</I> interventions are designed to be offered to all women; (2) <I>selective</I> interventions are designed to be offered to women at increased risk of developing depression; and (3) <I>indicated</I> interventions are designed to be offered to women who have been identified as depressed or probably depressed (<LINK REF="REF-Mrazek-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mrazek 1994</LINK>). To examine the effects of universal and selective interventions, subgroup analyses were conducted. The results suggest identifying mothers 'at-risk' may assist in the prevention of postpartum depression (average RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.50 to 0.88). However, currently there is no consistency in the identification of women 'at-risk' and a review of 16 antenatal screening tools suggests that there are no measures with acceptable predictive validity to accurately identify asymptomatic women who will later develop postpartum depression (<LINK REF="REF-Austin-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Austin 2003</LINK>). This may partially explain why interventions initiated in the postpartum period had a beneficial effect on reducing depressive symptomatology (average RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.59 to 0.90). Other differences in intervention delivery were also examined. Women who received a multiple-contact intervention were less likely to develop postpartum depression (RR average 0.78, 95% CI 0.66 to 0.93). It is noteworthy that all but five trials provided a multi-contact intervention. Individually-based interventions were effective in significantly reducing the number of women with depressive symptomatology at last study assessment and across the various assessment time periods. The decreased effect related to groups could be due to high group attrition and thus insufficient intervention dosage. It may also underpin the fact that there are many unique barriers for pregnant women and new mothers to attend sessions outside of their homes. It is noteworthy that five out of the 11 trials evaluating group-based interventions were classified as high risk of bias. Lastly, both professionally-based (average RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.60 to 1.00) and lay-based (average RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.90) interventions appeared beneficial in reducing the risk to develop depressive symptomatology at last assessment. The majority of the interventions included in this review were professionally-based.</P>
<P>There was insufficient evidence to show that the preventative interventions had an effect on other maternal outcomes including mortality, maternal-infant attachment, stress, perceived support, and marital discord. Most of these outcomes were measured in a relatively small number of trials. It is unclear if there was an effect on anxiety. However, women who received a preventative intervention were less likely to be dissatisfied with the care they received (average RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.44 to 1.00) than those who where provided with standard care. One study (<LINK REF="STD-MacArthur-2002" TYPE="STUDY">MacArthur 2002</LINK>) examined infant immunisations and found no beneficial effect; similar results were found with the one study (<LINK REF="STD-Cupples-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Cupples 2011</LINK>) that evaluated infant development. Another study (<LINK REF="STD-Armstrong-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Armstrong 1999</LINK>) examined child abuse and while there was a short-term gain when the nursing home visits were being offered, the beneficial effect was not maintained once the intervention discontinued. Very few trials evaluated these secondary outcomes and thus additional research in this area is warranted.</P>
<P>The long-term consequences of postpartum depression suggest preventive approaches are warranted. Manipulation of a risk factor may improve the associated likelihood of developing postpartum depression through many different ways. The most obvious is to decrease the amount of exposure to a given risk factor or, alternatively, reduce the strength or mechanism of the relationship between the risk factor and postpartum depression (<LINK REF="REF-McLennan-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">McLennan 2002</LINK>). However, translating risk factor research into predictive screening protocols and preventative interventions is challenging, as complex interactions of biopsychosocial risk factors with individual variations need to be considered. Theoretical justifications for a couple of these preventative approaches were presented by the individual researchers and there is accumulating evidence available to guide practice and policy recommendations. Details of research currently in progress are provided in the <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_ONGOING_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of ongoing studies</LINK> table.</P>

<P>Currently, there is no strong evidence to recommend the following interventions be implemented into practice in order to prevent postpartum depression: antenatal and postnatal classes, postpartum lay-based home visits, early postpartum follow-up, continuity of care models, in-hospital psychological debriefing, and cognitive behavioural therapy. However, professionally-based home visits such as intensive nursing home visits and flexible postpartum care provided by midwives, postpartum lay (peer)-based telephone support, and interpersonal psychotherapy appear to show promise in the prevention of postpartum depression. It is noteworthy that the midwifery-based flexible postpartum care and lay telephone support interventions incorporated screening with the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) for the early identification of depressive symptomatology. Interventions that are individually-based and initiated postnatally may be beneficial. Finally, interventions targeting 'at-risk' mothers may be more beneficial and feasible than those including a general maternal population.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2012-12-20 11:02:33 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There has been great interest in the prevention of postpartum depression. In total, over 40 experimental studies have evaluated an intervention that may be useful in the prevention of postpartum depression. Of these studies, 12 were quasi-experimental and excluded from this review resulting in 30 included randomised controlled trials of which 28 were included in the meta-analyses. Despite the recent upsurge of interest in this area, many questions remain unanswered.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Specific research implications</HEADING>
<UL>
<LI>Further research is warranted to examine the effectiveness of psychosocial interventions with a specific focus on intervention content to determine the specific preventative mechanisms. Randomised controlled trials inform whether an intervention is effective or not but they do not specify 'why' the intervention was effective. Did the intervention <I>directly</I> influence the development of postpartum depression by: (1) decreasing isolation and feelings of loneliness, (2) swaying health practices and deterring maladaptive behaviours or responses, (3) promoting positive psychological states and individual motivation, and (4) providing information regarding access to health services or the benefits of behaviours that positively influence health and well-being? Alternatively, did the intervention <I>buffer</I> the influence of stress or <I>mediate</I> the development of postpartum depression by: (1) assisting in the interpretation and positive reinforcement of performance accomplishments, (2) providing vicarious experience and observational learning through role modelling, (3) offering opportunities for social comparisons to promote self-evaluations and motivation, (4) teaching coping strategies and conveying information about ability, (5) positively interpreting emotional arousal, and (6) encouraging cognitive restructuring through anticipatory guidance? This information would assist with the theoretical development of preventative interventions and assist in matching risk factors with appropriate interventions.</LI>
<LI>Flexible, individualised postnatal care provided by a professional that incorporates postpartum depression screening tools appears to be promising. A well-designed trial conducted outside a UK-midwifery context is needed to replicate the results.</LI>
<LI>Telephone-based support provided by a peer among new mothers with beginning depressive symptomatology early in the postpartum period appears to be a promising secondary preventative intervention. Replication of this trial is needed.</LI>
<LI>Interpersonal psychotherapy is another promising intervention. All five trials that evaluated this intervention provided it face-to-face. Additional research in relation to diverse intervention providers and delivery mode (e.g., face-to-face, via telephone, or web-based) is warranted.</LI>
<LI>Further research is warranted to examine the effectiveness of cognitive-behavioural therapy.</LI>
<LI>Both professional and lay interventions appear to be beneficial. However, only seven out of the 28 trials evaluated a lay-based intervention. Trials examining individually-based lay interventions specifically targeting maternal mood are required. Characteristics of the lay individuals (peers versus general community-based workers) and the nature of the relationships developed should be explored.</LI>
<LI>Pregnant women and women in the postpartum period face unique health service barriers. Innovative and creative ways to deliver preventative interventions to these women are required including those that incorporate technology.</LI>
<LI>There is increasing evidence to suggest migrant women (refuge, asylum-seeking, immigrant) are at higher risk to develop postpartum depression. Interventions targeting this vulnerable maternal population are needed.</LI>
<LI>No preventative interventions specifically targeted the mother's partner. This is a significant limitation since a lack of social support and marital conflict are strong risk factors for the development of postpartum depression.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">General research implications</HEADING>
<P>Most women receive postpartum services at the primary care level. Hence, the quality of the postpartum depression care in the primary care systems needs to be improved. Various approaches have been employed to improve the quality of care for depression in general. Notable among these is the development of a collaborative care model, a multi-component, healthcare system-level intervention that uses case managers to link primary care providers, patients, and mental health specialists. Collaborative care models typically include case managers, who support primary care providers with functions such as patient education, patient follow-up to track depression outcomes and adherence to treatment, and adjustment of treatment plans for patients who do not improve. In studies of non-postpartum depression, collaborative treatment of depression has been acclaimed as superior to traditional treatment methods (e.g. antidepressants and/or psychotherapy). A special type of collaborative care&#8212;stepped care treatment&#8212;delivers care in a step-wise manner, beginning with screening, diagnosis, and initial treatment in a primary care setting and adding follow-up and support, decision support, mental health consultation, or referral by a care manager as needed for patients with persistent depressive symptoms. Although it would seem that collaborative care would also improve postpartum depression outcomes, neither collaborative or stepped care have been rigorously evaluated in a postpartum population. Such evaluation would be important given that postpartum women often possess unique help-seeking and treatment barriers, such as the need for childcare, concerns about medication effects on breastfeeding infants, and fear of judgment or referral to child protection. Postpartum depression collaborative, stepped care models should include interventions to prevent postpartum depression. To be most efficient in conducting this research there continues to be a need for further interdisciplinary networking among investigators with complementary research interests. For example, psychosocial intervention researchers could collaborate with health services researchers to develop and test multi-level intervention approaches embedded in service systems. To further address postpartum depression as a public health problem, the inclusion of ethnically and socio-economically diverse women in these research efforts is critical to examining the differences in depression symptoms, response rate to interventions, and health service use. In addition, all trials should include an economic analysis of the relative costs and benefits. It is also necessary to present a few general comments regarding the development of preventive programs. Similar to screening initiatives, preventive interventions should be relatively simple and inexpensive. This is critical if the intervention is to be applied to a relatively large population; unless a project is feasible on a large scale, there is little utility in pursuing smaller demonstration projects.</P>

<P>Methodological concerns that could lead to selection and outcome bias. This was a cluster design where Home-Start schemes (informal volunteer family support program) were the unit of randomisation. Randomisation allocation scheme was done by the project manager using a coin toss during a phone call with the Home-Start scheme co-ordinator. The participants were aware of the group allocation of their cluster before enrolling in the study. The study began by only following those in the intervention group that accepted the intervention. Started to follow everyone part way through the study. This resulted in a 8-week follow-up rate of 61.3% in the intervention group and 77.1 in the control group (overall 68.9%).

<P>Methodological concerns that could lead to selection and outcome bias. Inconsistant application of inclusion criteria. The first 44% of sample were assessed before randomisation for depression and those with depressive illness (measured with SCID) were to be ineligible. Howerver, 17.4% of those with a positive SCID were included in the study as decided by researcher. The report states that 'they showed no signs of great distress during the interview, reported having social support, were accepting of their pregnancy, had low anxiety scores and were unlikely to get treatment elsewhere'. The second 55% of the sample were assessed for depression after randomisation to increase recruitment numbers. There was also a differential rate of follow-up. At 6 weeks postpartum follow-up data were obtained on 61.4% of those in the control group and 28.4% in the intervention group.

<P>Improper randomisation procedure used. The characteristics of the study population and type of intervention met inclusion criteria for this review however, randomisation of women was not done. 2 hospitals were randomised to provide a childbirth psycho-education program or not. The authors stated that 'randomisation by woman was not feasible because of potential for contamination between study groups'. We considered including this trial as a cluster design but decided against it for the following reasons: 1) the number of clusters was very low (2 hospitals); 2) cluster size was small (92 women per cluster); 3) there were large differences in the baseline characteristics of age, education and income between the groups all favouring the experimental group (older, more educated and higher income); 4) the analysis was not done taking into account the cluster randomisation; and 5) no intra-class correlation coefficient was provided.</P>

Interviews were done if: 1) the EPDS score was &gt; 12; 2) women were currently receiving treatment or medication for a psychological disorder; and 3) for a stratified sample of women with lower EPDS scores (59% for those with scores 10-12, 10% with scores 5-9 and 5% with scores &lt; 5). If a woman did not have a clinical interview she was categorised as 'not depressed'.

<P>Bias risk for cluster trial: it is not stated whether participants were aware of the group allocation of their cluster before enrolling in the study. Recruitment rates did not differ between clusters. Randomisation of clusters used minimisation based on socioeconomic deprivation and midwife caseload. Mulitvariate model analysis was used to test whether baseline characteristics differed more than would be expected given cluster-randomisation and showed no significant differences. For any proportional differences the ones generally indicative of worse health outcome were biased again the intervention group. 1 cluster was lost from the trial when the single midwife in the cluster went on long-term sick leave and could not be replaced.</P>

<DESCRIPTION>
<P>Bias risk for cluster trial: it is possible that the participants were aware of the group allocation of their cluster before enrolling in the study however, this was not directly discussed during the consent process [personal communication]. Randomisation of clusters was stratified by district and existence of pre-existing women's group. Baseline differences in household assets, maternal education, literacy and tribal membership were noted between the intervention and control groups with women in the intervention group generally poorer and more disadvantaged than those in the control group. No full clusters were lost to follow-up. It is possible that the cluster randomisation resulted in a 'herd-effect' where more women attended a women's group than if individual randomisation had occurred.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Selection of trials</HEADING>
<P>Titles and abstracts of the electronic searches were reviewed by the primary reviewer. We independently evaluated trials under consideration for methodological quality and appropriateness for inclusion, without consideration of their results. We resolved uncertainties regarding the appropriateness for inclusion through discussion and consensus.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Methodological quality assessment</HEADING>
<P>We assessed the quality of the trials that met the eligibility criteria using the following criteria:</P>
<OL>
<LI>generation of random allocation sequence: adequate, inadequate, unclear;</LI>
<LI>allocation concealment: A = adequate, B = unclear, C = inadequate;</LI>
<LI>blinding of participants: yes, no, inadequate, no information;</LI>
<LI>blinding of caregivers: yes, no, inadequate, no information;</LI>
<LI>blinding of outcome assessment: yes, no, inadequate or no information;</LI>
<LI>completeness of follow-up data (including any differential loss of participants from each group): A = less than 3% of participants excluded, B = 3% to 9.9% of participants excluded, C = 10% to 19.9% excluded, D = 20% or more excluded, E = unclear;</LI>
<LI>analysis of participants in randomised groups.</LI>
</OL>
<P>We assigned a rating to each trial, compared results and discussed differences until we reached agreement. We have clearly described reasons for exclusion of any apparently eligible trial (<I>see</I> 'Characteristics of excluded studies' table).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Data extraction</HEADING>
<P>We independently extracted data from trial reports using a pilot-tested data extraction form developed by the primary reviewer. Wherever necessary, we requested unpublished or missing data from the trial contact author. In addition, we sought data to allow an 'intention-to-treat' analysis. Data were entered into <LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2000</LINK> by one reviewer and double data entry was completed by the other reviewer or a research assistant.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Data synthesis</HEADING>
<P>Trials using different preventive strategies were analysed separately and the results combined only if there was no reason to think that they differed in relevant ways. While the primary meta-analysis was based on the occurrence of postpartum depression or not (however measured by trialists), we incorporated several depression rating scales or cut-off points. To address the potential measurement differences, we used a fixed-effect model to make direct comparisons between trials using the same rating scale and cut-off. If trials used different ways of measuring the same continuous outcome, we used standardised mean differences. We performed meta-analyses using relative risks as the measure of effect size for binary outcomes, and weighted mean differences for continuous outcome measures, both with 95% confidence intervals. We assessed the extent to which there were between-study differences including variations in the population or intervention.</P>
<P>We used fixed-effect meta-analysis to combine study data. We investigated heterogeneity by calculating I<SUP>2 </SUP>statistics (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2002</LINK>), and if this indicated a high level of heterogeneity among the trials included in an analysis (I<SUP>2</SUP> &gt; 50%), we used random-effects meta-analysis for an overall summary. Where we found high levels of heterogeneity, we explored these by sensitivity analyses excluding the trials most susceptible to bias based on the following quality assessment: (1) those with unclear allocation concealment (B); (2) high levels of postrandomisation losses or exclusions (D); or (3) unblinded outcome assessment or blinding of outcome assessment uncertain.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Subgroup analyses</HEADING>
<P>We planned and completed the following six a priori subgroup analyses:</P>
<OL>
<LI>the effectiveness of specific types of psychosocial interventions;</LI>
<LI>the effectiveness of specific types of psychological interventions;</LI>
<LI>the effects of intervention mode (e.g. individual versus group-based interventions);</LI>
<LI>the effects of intervention onset (e.g. antenatal and postnatal interventions versus postnatal only interventions);</LI>
<LI>the effects of intervention duration (e.g. single-contact interventions versus multiple-contact interventions);</LI>
<LI>the effects of sample selection criteria (e.g. women with specific risk factors versus the general population).</LI>
