<I>Taping across the knee cap for adults with persistent pain at the front of the knee (patellofemoral pain)</I>
</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2012-03-02 12:59:33 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Lindsey Elstub">
<P>Pain at the front of the knee (also known as anterior knee pain or patellofemoral pain) is a common problem which particularly affects those who do some form of sport or exercise. Typically, it gets worse when going up and down stairs, squatting, kneeling and sitting with the knee bent. It is a distinct and separate condition from knee arthritis.</P>
<P>Such anterior knee pain is often treated by physiotherapists, who use a variety of techniques. One such technique is the use of a simple piece of adhesive tape across the knee cap to control the positioning of the knee-cap (patella) and potentially reduce the pain during movement.</P>
<P>The review found five trials, involving around 200 participants with this condition, which compared the clinical use of taping with no taping. All five studies differed from each other in terms of the type of participants (one trial involved army recruits), length and schedule of the treatment programme and assessment of outcome. In four trials, participants of both taping and no or placebo taping groups were prescribed exercises. In part because both the therapist and the patient knew whether they were getting taping, some caution was necessary in interpreting the study results. Pooled results from four trials (161 knees) for the level of pain at the end of the treatment programme (ranging for one week to three months) showed no difference between those given taping and those not. Data for other outcomes measuring function and activities of daily living were from single trials only and gave different results.</P>
<P>The review concluded that the currently available evidence from trials reporting clinically relevant outcomes is and low quality and insufficient to draw conclusions on the effects of taping. However, before further trials are conducted, some consensus is required to establish the typical patients, taping technique and the best way of measuring outcome.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2012-03-02 12:43:04 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Patellofemoral pain syndrome refers to the clinical presentation of knee pain related to changes in the patellofemoral joint. Patellofemoral pain syndrome usually has a gradual onset of pain with none of the features associated with other knee diseases or trauma. It is often treated by physiotherapists, who use a variety of techniques including patellar taping. This involves the application of adhesive sports medical tape applied directly to the skin over the patella on the front of the knee. Patients often report an instantaneous improvement in pain and function after the tape is applied, but its longer term effects are uncertain.</P>

<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2012-02-29 15:27:44 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The objective was to assess the effects, primarily on pain and function, of patellar taping for treating patellofemoral pain syndrome in adults.</P>

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2012-03-02 12:44:49 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, CINAHL, EMBASE, PEDro, SPORTDiscus, AMED, reference lists of articles, trial registers and conference proceedings.

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-03-02 13:56:32 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Five small heterogeneous randomised controlled trials, all at high risk of performance bias and most at risk of at least one other type of bias, were included. These involved approximately 200 participants with a diagnosis of patellofemoral pain syndrome. All compared taping versus control (no or placebo taping) and all included one or more co-interventions given to both taping and control group participants; this was prescribed exercise in four trials. The intensity and length of treatment was very varied: for example, length of treatment ranged from one week in one trial to three months in another. A meta-analysis of the visual analogue scale (VAS) pain data (scale 0 to 10: worst pain), measured in different ways, from four trials (data from 161 knees), found no statistically or clinically significant difference between taping and non taping in pain at the end of the treatment programmes (mean difference (MD) -0.15; 95% confidence interval (CI) -1.15 to 0.85; random-effects model used given the significant heterogeneity (P &lt; 0.0001)). Data for other outcomes measuring function and activities of daily living were from single trials only and gave contradictory results.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2012-03-02 14:53:30 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Lindsey Elstub">
<P>The currently available evidence from trials reporting clinically relevant outcomes is low quality and insufficient to draw conclusions on the effects of taping, whether used on its own or as part of a treatment programme. Further research involving large, preferably multi-centre, good quality and well reported randomised controlled trials that measure clinically important outcomes and long-term results is warranted. Before this, consensus is required on the diagnosis of patellofemoral pain syndrome, the standardisation of outcome measurement and an acceptable approach for patellar taping.</P>

<P>Patellofemoral pain syndrome refers to the clinical presentation of knee pain related to changes in the patellofemoral joint. Patellofemoral pain syndrome usually has a gradual onset of pain with none of the features associated with other knee injuries or diseases. Authors in the United Kingdom (<LINK REF="REF-Anderson-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anderson 2003</LINK>), mainland Europe (<LINK REF="REF-Witvrouw-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Witvrouw 2003</LINK>), Australia (<LINK REF="REF-McConnell-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">McConnell 1996</LINK>) and the USA (<LINK REF="REF-Brechter-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brechter 2002</LINK>) have stated that 25% of the adult population present with patellofemoral pain at some point, but have cited data from studies involving sporting or military cohorts. As a recent population estimate for adults aged between 19 to 50 years is just over 25 million in England alone (<LINK REF="REF-ONS-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">ONS 2007</LINK>), these estimates may indicate that patellofemoral pain syndrome is a considerable health burden. However, the true prevalence and incidence of patellofemoral pain syndrome in the population as a whole remains unknown (<LINK REF="REF-Callaghan-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Callaghan 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>Patellofemoral pain syndrome can cause functional limitations (<LINK REF="REF-Callaghan-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Callaghan 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Callaghan-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Callaghan 2004</LINK>). The best way to manage the condition remains controversial and treatment failure rates are reported to be high (<LINK REF="REF-Brown-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brown 2000</LINK>). Researchers have shown that patients may have higher than expected levels of disability (<LINK REF="REF-Clark-2000b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clark 2000b</LINK>) and psychological morbidity (<LINK REF="REF-Jensen-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jensen 2005</LINK>). A significant number may still experience symptoms many years after diagnosis (<LINK REF="REF-Nimon-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nimon 1998</LINK>) and there are concerns that the syndrome may predispose to osteoarthritis (<LINK REF="REF-Utting-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Utting 2005</LINK>). However, the possibility that anterior knee pain is a risk factor for incident patellofemoral osteoarthritis warrants further attention (<LINK REF="REF-Thomas-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thomas 2010</LINK>). The aetiology of patellofemoral pain syndrome is also unclear, with some studies suggesting that biomechanical abnormalities may be precipitated by occupation, sports or footwear (<LINK REF="REF-Cheung-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cheung 2006</LINK>). Higher body mass indices have been observed in patients with patellofemoral pain syndrome (<LINK REF="REF-Clark-2000b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clark 2000b</LINK>) and this apparent association cannot be ignored given the increasing prevalence of obesity in society.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Anatomical considerations for this condition</HEADING>
<P>The patellofemoral joint is a complex joint arrangement between the back of the patella (knee-cap) and the reciprocally shaped distal end of the femur (thigh bone). The patella is a rounded bone embedded in the quadriceps tendon and is the largest of its kind (a sesamoid bone) in the body. Its joint surface has a large flat area on the outside, a smaller convex area on the inside, which in turn has a smaller area at its extreme, usually described as the 'odd facet' (<LINK REF="REF-Goodfellow-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goodfellow 1976</LINK>). The patellofemoral joint is a synovial joint and is the least stable joint in the lower limb; it has six degrees of freedom of motion and very large forces of multiple times the body weight are applied rapidly through a wide range of motion during everyday functional activities (<LINK REF="REF-Selfe-2010b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Selfe 2010b</LINK>). The primary role of the patella is to increase the efficiency and mechanical advantage of the large quadriceps muscles on the front of the thigh (<LINK REF="REF-Malek-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Malek 1981</LINK>). It also has a role in distributing the compressive forces at the joint by increasing the contact area between patella and thigh bone. The patella provides a fulcrum for the static and dynamic stabilisation supports (<LINK REF="REF-Malek-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Malek 1981</LINK>). The static stabilisers of the patella are a variety of ligaments, bursae (fluid sacs) and fascial tissue that keep the patella in its position in the centre of the knee. The dynamic stabilisers are muscle and tendons, the most important of which are the quadriceps muscles and, to a lesser extent, the hamstrings at the back of the thigh.</P>

<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2012-02-29 16:33:26 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Patellar taping is an inexpensive technique readily and often used in the treatment of patients with patellofemoral pain syndrome. The technique involves the application of adhesive sports medical tape directly to the skin over the patella on the front of the knee. Usually, this tape is applied by physiotherapists during a treatment session but it can also be applied by patients at home and left on during waking hours. A variety of taping methods and techniques are in use. These include variations in the type of tape (elastic or rigid), the direction of pull of the tape (medial, lateral, inferior, superior, rotational, or no directional pull at all) and the number of layers of tape applied over the patella.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2012-02-29 16:35:24 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The dominant theory from both orthopaedic and physiotherapy perspectives is that most patellofemoral pain is the result of some form of patellar malalignment. But although it is purported to be present in the majority of patients with gradual, non-arthritic and non-traumatic patellar pain, the same cannot be said for adolescents who usually have patella problems related to growth and development (<LINK REF="REF-Grelsamer-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grelsamer 1998</LINK>). Physical correction of malalignment is just one of the reasons why patellar taping is thought to be beneficial for patellofemoral pain syndrome and there is an implication that the correction of static stability may restore normal patellar tracking by also improving dynamic stability. <LINK REF="REF-McConnell-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">McConnell 1986</LINK> originally described patellar taping as part of a treatment programme for patellofemoral pain syndrome and theorised that this technique could alter patellar alignment, enhance contractions of the vastus medialis oblique (VMO) muscle, and hence decrease pain. Although these theories how a taping intervention might work were accepted for many years, subsequent studies have been contradictory regarding the ability of taping to realign patellar position (<LINK REF="REF-Crossley-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Crossley 2000</LINK>) and to enhance VMO contractions (<LINK REF="REF-Cerny-1995b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cerny 1995b</LINK>). Nevertheless, a number of studies have shown that patellar taping does decrease pain in patients with patellofemoral pain syndrome (for example, <LINK REF="REF-Powers-1997b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Powers 1997b</LINK>), although the mechanism for this symptomatic improvement remains unknown (<LINK REF="REF-Callaghan-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Callaghan 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Selfe-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Selfe 2004</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2012-02-29 16:37:37 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>While the true health burden of patellofemoral pain syndrome is not known, it is common in young active adults and a source of long term disability (<LINK REF="REF-Clark-2000b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clark 2000b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nimon-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nimon 1998</LINK>). The best way to manage the condition is not known and treatment failures are frequent (<LINK REF="REF-Brown-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brown 2000</LINK>). Patellar taping is commonly used in clinical practice for this condition either as a sole technique, or more commonly in conjunction with an exercise programme. We set out to systematically review the evidence for patellar taping for treating patellofemoral pain syndrome.</P>

<P>Both authors (MJC and JS) independently assessed the risk of bias of included studies using The Cochrane Collaboration's 'Risk of bias' tool (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2008</LINK>). We assessed risk of selection bias (based on an assessment of random sequence generation and allocation concealment), performance bias (based on assessment of blinding of participants and therapists administrating the treatment), detection bias (based on assessment of assessor blinding), attrition bias (based on assessment of completeness of outcome data), and 'other bias'. For 'other bias', we assessed comparability of the treatment groups at baseline, the inclusion of other care programmes for the participants, and the monitoring treatment compliance during the trial. Disagreement was resolved by consensus without recourse to third party intervention. Neither author was blinded to the authorship of studies.</P>

Notably, <LINK REF="STD-Mason-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Mason 2011</LINK>, which had a wider age range of 13 to 82 years, specifically did not exclude patients with arthritis of the patellofemoral joint.

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-03-02 13:56:02 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Five small heterogeneous trials, including around 200 patients (216 knees) with a diagnosis of patellofemoral pain syndrome, were included. All compared taping versus control (no or placebo taping) and all included one or more co-interventions; this was prescribed exercise in four trials. Pooled visual analogue data from four trials (161 knees) for various measures of pain at the end of treatment (this ranged from one week to three months) showed no significant benefit from taping. Separately, two trials found better results after taping for functional index questionnaire data and Cincinnati knee activity scores. Another trial found no significant benefit for taping in WOMAC scores at the end of treatment or at 12 months. The same trial also found no benefit from taping for subsequent referral or physiotherapy.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2012-03-02 14:50:24 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Lindsey Elstub">
<P>The available evidence from trials testing the clinical effects of taping is little, amounting at maximum to pooled pain data for 161 knees. Even for this 'exploratory' analysis, the heterogeneous nature of the trial populations, interventions and outcome measures (both in timing and definition) is considerable.</P>
<P>In terms of the trial populations, there was considerable variation in the inclusion criteria and definition of patellofemoral pain syndrome among and often within the studies. The most common discrepancy was the length of time the patient had their patellofemoral pain at the time of recruitment. In one study, which involved army recruits, this was 'acute' (<LINK REF="STD-Whittingham-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Whittingham 2004</LINK>), whereas a lower limit of one month or more was applied for the other four studies. This means that it is possible that the patients were not comparable. Establishing inclusion and exclusion criteria for trials of patellofemoral pain syndrome will always be hampered by the lack of a gold standard diagnostic test for the condition. It remains essentially a diagnosis of exclusion reliant on description of symptoms and thorough clinical examination to exclude other causes of pain at the anterior part of the knee which are not directly related to the patellofemoral joint. Additionally, our focus was on non-arthritic patellofemoral pain but inclusion of patients with patellofemoral osteoarthritis was permitted by <LINK REF="STD-Mason-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Mason 2011</LINK> and was likely given the older population and the long duration of symptoms (up to 15 years) in some patients.</P>
<P>The interventions also varied as did the co-interventions (e.g. exercise, education, ice). Some studies described in detail the method of taping used, including the technique and also the type of taping (e.g. <LINK REF="STD-Mason-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Mason 2011</LINK>), whereas others gave no description (e.g. <LINK REF="STD-Tunay-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Tunay 2003</LINK>). There are anyway insufficient data to assess if there are differences in effect between a complex taping technique and a simple one. The frequency and intensity of taping (and co-interventions) also varied. <LINK REF="STD-Mason-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Mason 2011</LINK>, which compared taping versus control for one week only before moving onto a composite treatment, commented that "the objective improvement over such a short time period was unexpected". <LINK REF="STD-Whittingham-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Whittingham 2004</LINK> found complete recovery from an acute episode after four weeks in the group given taping, and good improvement too (perhaps reflecting the advice to stop certain activities) in the two control groups. This reflects also the variation in the trial populations, but also links with the assessment of outcome, which was mainly at the end of the treatment programmes. Only <LINK REF="STD-Clark-2000a" TYPE="STUDY">Clark 2000a</LINK> followed up trial participants subsequently.</P>
<P>One finding of this review was the disappointing lack of standardisation of even a simple outcome measure such as the visual analogue score for pain. This highlights an important methodological issue for future researchers into patellofemoral pain in general and the use of patellar taping in particular. Adopting a valid, reliable and standardised pain score is the obvious aim, but true standardisation is hampered by the fact that patients may declare different pain inducing activities when they use the visual analogue score. These activities usually include stair ascent or descent, squatting, kneeling and prolonged sitting. There was no comparability among the trials in the use of other measures of pain and function, or the more generic self-reporting scales such as the WOMAC.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2012-02-29 12:54:52 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Lindsey Elstub">
<P>As shown in the risk of bias summary (<LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>), all five trials were at high of bias in least one domain, which was invariably performance bias reflecting the lack of blinding in those applying the taping and, generally, the trial participants. Poorly described or conducted randomisation, with insufficient attention to ensuring allocation concealment put three trial at high risk of selection bias. Assessor blinding, which should be possible for at least some outcomes, was not done in two studies. Unit of analysis problems, through the inclusion of patients with problems in both knees, and the incomplete information on loss to follow-up were also sources of bias. The quality of the evidence was also hampered by small sample sizes. Overall, the quality of the evidence, using the GRADE terminology, lies between 'Low quality' ("Further research is very likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and is likely to change the estimate") and 'Very low quality' ("We are very uncertain about the estimate").</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2012-02-29 12:55:09 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Lindsey Elstub">
<P>Aside from the changes, which included incorporating updated methodology described in <LINK TAG="PRO_REV_DIFF" TYPE="SECTION">Differences between protocol and review</LINK>, this review was conducted in accordance with our previously published protocol. We took care to search extensively for studies which were in abstract form but might have proceeded to full publication. We also made great efforts (and were generally successful) to contact authors of studies which were unpublished or were uncompleted trials to ascertain whether their data could be included. Several authors confirmed points for clarification and sent additional data; most of these trials were eventually considered to be ineligible because they did not answer our research question.<BR/>

<P>Another review in this area has looked at the immediate (very short term effect) of patellar taping (and bracing) on knee pain with and without knee osteoarthritis (<LINK REF="REF-Warden-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Warden 2008</LINK>). There were three trials in <LINK REF="REF-Warden-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Warden 2008</LINK> that are also included in this Cochrane review (<LINK REF="STD-Clark-2000a" TYPE="STUDY">Clark 2000a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kowall-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Kowall 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Whittingham-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Whittingham 2004</LINK>). The outcome used for in <LINK REF="REF-Warden-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Warden 2008</LINK> was the visual analogue scale/score (VAS) (mm) for pain, but no comment was made about the variation in the nominated activity chosen to score the VAS. <LINK REF="REF-Warden-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Warden 2008</LINK> compared also the effects of medial directed, lateral directed patellar taping, sham taping and no taping. No analysis was performed using other measures of function or activity.</P>

<P>Patellar taping is a relatively inexpensive and regularly used treatment intervention for patellofemoral pain syndrome. It is frequently used as part of an exercise and rehabilitation programme for this condition. However, the currently available evidence from trials reporting clinically relevant outcomes is low quality and insufficient to draw conclusions on the effects of taping, whether used on its own or as part of a treatment programme.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2012-03-02 14:52:00 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Although the exact mechanism of patellar taping for the treatment of patellofemoral pain syndrome is unclear, it remains an attractive intervention in terms of application and potential. The low quality clinical evidence available so far does not endorse patellar taping, showing minimal evidence of any effect. It is thus timely that clinicians' enthusiasm for this intervention should be put to the test by conducting large, preferably multi-centre, good quality and well reported randomised controlled trials that measure clinically important outcomes and long-term results. Before this, consensus is required on the diagnosis of patellofemoral pain syndrome, including the avoidance of including patients with osteoarthritis, the standardisation of outcome measurement and an acceptable approach for patellar taping. Some promising progress has been made in this regard in terms of terminology, including shifting away from labelling this condition as a syndrome (<LINK REF="REF-Ghent-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ghent 2011</LINK>). These are likely to enhance the successful initiation and conduct of such trials and the acceptability and applicability of their findings.</P>

<PRO_REV_DIFF MODIFIED="2012-03-02 14:38:25 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Lindsey Elstub">
<P>We clarified that our intention was to compare tape versus no or placebo tape and thus we excluded studies that compared patellar taping with another intervention (such as exercises) or that compared composite interventions, that included patellar taping, with no intervention or different interventions.</P>
<P>In the protocol under the title 'Timepoints considered', we stated that we would consider studies that analysed the effect of patellar taping immediately post application. We have removed this and have only considered patellar taping when it was used as part of a treatment programme for a sustained period. We have also removed 'change of range of motion' as one of the 'Types of outcome measures'.</P>
<P>In accordance with the latest Cochrane recommendations, we have completely replaced the quality assessment tool with the 'Risk of bias' tool.</P>
