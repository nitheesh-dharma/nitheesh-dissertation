<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2012-01-24 21:46:09 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Infection of the upper genital tract, including the uterus and fallopian tubes, can cause complications after induced abortion. Antibiotics given around the time of the abortion (prophylaxis) could prevent this complication. We found 19 randomised controlled trials that looked at the effect of antibiotic prophylaxis on post-abortal upper genital tract infection amongst women requesting induced abortion in the first trimester of pregnancy. We looked at the effect of any antibiotic prophylaxis regimen on the outcome. Overall, the risk of post-abortal upper genital tract infection in women receiving antibiotics was 59% that of women who received placebo. There were, however, differences between the trial results over and above what would be expected by chance alone. It should be noted that, if the infection is caused by a sexually transmitted organism, antibiotic prophylaxis will not protect the woman from becoming re-infected if her sexual partner has not been treated. None of the trials was done in lower or middle income countries, which is where the risk of post-abortal complications is highest. Further trials are needed to determine whether combinations of antibiotics can prevent more infections than single antibiotics, or whether antibiotic prophylaxis should be restricted to women with positive results of screening tests before the abortion.</P>

<P>There are two main strategies for the prevention of post-abortal upper genital tract infection: antibiotics given around the time of surgery for all women; and 'screen-and-treat', in which all women presenting for abortion are screened for genital infections and those with positive results are treated.</P>

<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2012-01-10 11:34:03 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in any language including women undergoing induced first trimester surgical or medical abortion, comparing: 1) any antibiotic regimen to placebo, nothing, or another antibiotic; 2) screen-and-treat versus antibiotics. The primary outcome was the proportion of women diagnosed with post-abortal upper genital tract infection.</P>

<P>Two reviewers independently selected references and extracted data. We calculated risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI).

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-02-03 13:52:57 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>A total of 703 unique items was identified. We included 19 RCTs. There was evidence of small study biases (Egger test, P = 0.002). In 15 placebo-controlled RCTs there was an effect of antibiotic prophylaxis (pooled RR 0.59, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.75, 95% PI 0.30 to 1.14, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 39%). There were insufficient data (three trials) to determine whether one regimen was superior to another. In one trial, the incidence of post-abortal upper genital tract infection was higher in women allocated to the screen-and-treat strategy (RR 1.53, 95% CI 0.99 to 2.36).</P>

<P>Antibiotic prophylaxis at the time of first trimester surgical abortion is effective in preventing post-abortal upper genital tract infection. Evidence of between trial heterogeneity suggests that the effect might not apply to all settings, population groups or interventions.</P>
<P>This review did not determine the most effective antibiotic prophylaxis regimen. Antibiotic choice should take into account the local epidemiology of genital tract infections, including sexually transmitted infections.</P>
<P>Further RCTs comparing different antibiotics or combinations of antibiotics with each other would be useful. Such trials could be done in low and middle income countries and where the prevalence of genital tract infections in women presenting for abortion is high.</P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2012-02-03 14:02:17 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2012-02-03 13:58:02 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Each year 210 million women become pregnant, of whom an estimated 42 million have an induced abortion (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2011</LINK>). Abortion causes 70,000 deaths and 4,652,171 Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) lost per year worldwide, the vast majority due to unsafe abortions in developing countries. Thirteen percent (47,000) of maternal deaths worldwide are due to unsafe abortion and infections are a major contributor (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2011</LINK>), Cervical instrumentation can introduce bacteria from the vagina and cervix into the endometrial cavity, leading to post-abortal upper genital tract infection (<LINK REF="REF-Sawaya-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sawaya 1996</LINK>). The terms post-abortal pelvic infection (<LINK REF="STD-Levallois-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Levallois 1988</LINK>) and post-abortal pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) (<LINK REF="REF-Heisterberg-1988b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heisterberg 1988b</LINK>), have also been used to describe this condition. Infectious agents associated with post-abortal upper genital tract infection include exogenous bacteria, endogenous vaginal anaerobes associated with bacterial vaginosis, or sexually transmitted cervical pathogens (<I>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</I> and <I>Chlamydia trachomatis</I>). The prevalence of endocervical <I>C. trachomatis</I> in women presenting for abortion has been found to be 13-14% amongst women screened using a nucleic acid amplification test in abortion clinics in England in 1999-2000 (<LINK REF="REF-Pimenta-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pimenta 2003</LINK>) and 2.9% in women undergoing legal abortion in Maputo, Mozambique in 1991-1992, tested using direct immunofluorescence staining (<LINK REF="REF-Machungo-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Machungo 2002</LINK>). Risk factors for post-abortal upper genital tract infection include a history of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) and the presence of a lower genital tract infection due to <I>N. gonorrhoeae</I>, <I>C. trachomatis</I> or bacterial vaginosis at the time of abortion (<LINK REF="REF-Heisterberg-1988b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heisterberg 1988b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nielsen-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Nielsen 1993</LINK>). Post-abortal upper genital tract infection is associated with short-term morbidity (<LINK REF="REF-Cameron-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cameron 2002</LINK>) and upper genital tract infections have long-term sequelae in the form of chronic pelvic pain, dyspareunia, infertility and ectopic pregnancy (<LINK REF="REF-Soper-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Soper 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>Antibiotics given around the time of abortion should reduce the risk of post-abortal upper genital tract infection. There is, however, ongoing debate about the most effective strategy and antibiotic regimen (<LINK REF="REF-Cameron-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cameron 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Penney-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Penney 1998</LINK>). The possible approaches that have been investigated so far are described below.</P>
<P>
<B>Antibiotic prophylaxis</B>
</P>
<P>Antibiotic prophylaxis is defined as the 'use of antibiotics before, during, or after a diagnostic, therapeutic, or surgical procedure to prevent infectious complications' (<LINK REF="REF-National-Centre-for-Biotechnology-Information-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">National Centre for Biotechnology Information 2010</LINK>). For women undergoing abortion, this means that they are given antibiotics around the time of surgery even if they are not known to have a vaginal or cervical infection. Universal prophylaxis means that all women are given antibiotics, without carrying out tests for infection. The case in favour of universal antibiotic prophylaxis was first made in a systematic review (<LINK REF="REF-Sawaya-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sawaya 1996</LINK>). Sawaya et al. conducted a meta-analysis of 12 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) published between 1966 and 1994 comparing antibiotics with placebo. They reported a substantial reduction in the risk of post-abortal upper genital tract infection in women receiving antibiotic prophylaxis (relative risk, RR 0.58, 95% confidence intervals, CI 0.47 to 0.71, fixed-effects meta-analysis) but there was substantial between-
trial heterogeneity in the results (reported as P &lt; 0.001 for homogeneity). The authors concluded that there had been strong evidence that antibiotics reduce the risk of post-abortal infection since 1986 and that further placebo-controlled trials should not be performed (<LINK REF="REF-Sawaya-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sawaya 1996</LINK>). Guidelines about the use of antibiotic prophylaxis for abortion have since been published by several national guideline development groups (<LINK REF="REF-Achilles-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Achilles 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-ACOG-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">ACOG 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-RCOG-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">RCOG 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-SIGN-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">SIGN 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<B>Screen-and-treat</B>
</P>
<P>Screen-and-treat means that all women presenting for a termination of pregnancy are screened for genital infections. Those with positive results are treated as soon as the results are known, preferably before the procedure. A screen-and-treat strategy for preventing post-abortal upper genital tract infection due to chlamydia has been evaluated (<LINK REF="STD-Giertz-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Giertz 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Penney-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Penney 1998</LINK>). The major advantage of the screen-and-treat strategy over universal antibiotic prophylaxis is that, if the woman has a sexually transmitted infection, partner notification and treatment can be done to reduce the risk of re-infection from untreated sexual partners (<LINK REF="REF-Cameron-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cameron 2002</LINK>). In addition, the screen-and-treat strategy avoids the unnecessary administration of antibiotics to non-infected women and provides an opportunity to screen for other sexually transmitted infections and offer counselling (<LINK REF="REF-Cameron-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cameron 2002</LINK>). However, this strategy is costly and requires more organisation than does universal prophylaxis. Timely provision of results is essential and, even then might delay the procedure if the initial assessment and abortion take place at the same visit. Furthermore, false negative screening test results and infections not screened for can still put women at risk of post-abortal infection (<LINK REF="STD-Penney-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Penney 1998</LINK>). The infections for which women should be tested differs between settings. The low prevalence of gonorrhoea among women undergoing abortion in the United Kingdom (approximately 0.2%) (<LINK REF="STD-Blackwell-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Blackwell 1993</LINK>) makes screening in asymptomatic women controversial (<LINK REF="REF-Cameron-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cameron 2002</LINK>). In contrast, the prevalence of bacterial vaginosis is high among women requesting abortion, ranging from 17.5% (<LINK REF="STD-Penney-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Penney 1998</LINK>) to 28% (<LINK REF="STD-Blackwell-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Blackwell 1993</LINK>). Furthermore, <I>C. trachomatis </I>is detected more often in women with bacterial vaginosis and it may facilitate the carriage of chlamydia to the upper genital tract (<LINK REF="STD-Blackwell-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Blackwell 1993</LINK>). Combining preoperative screening with universal antibiotic prophylaxis could prevent both short-term morbidity and allow treatment of sexual partners of infected women, but this would increase costs to the health service even more.</P>
<P>An updated systematic review of the effects of antibiotic prophylaxis in induced abortion provides opportunities to include more recent trials and to address unanswered questions. These may include differences in the effectiveness of antibiotics in trials of women who are not screened for infections preoperatively and those that excluded women with diagnosed infections: determining the optimal antibiotic regimen determining adverse effects and examining the implications for re-infection in women who had a sexually transmitted infection before the abortion.</P>

<B>Study identification and data extraction</B>
</P>
<P>Two reviewers assessed the titles and abstracts as well as full-text publications to determine eligibility. The same two reviewers used a standardised form to extract data, in duplicate, for characteristics of trials and patients, type of intervention and antibiotic prophylaxis conducted, as well as number of women developing post-abortal upper genital tract infection. Information about trial characteristics that might be associated with bias in the effect estimates, including randomisation sequence generation, concealment of allocation, blinding, and exclusion of participants from analysis after randomisation were also assessed, using criteria from the Cochrane Handbook. Disagreements were resolved by discussion with a third reviewer. We also contacted the trial authors to request clarifications and obtain missing data. Entry of the data in Review Manager software (RevMan 5) was double checked.</P>
<P>
<B>Data synthesis and analysis </B>
</P>
<P>We first conducted a descriptive synthesis of the trials and their results and displayed the results in forest plots (RevMan 5).</P>
<UL>
<LI>For the primary outcome we have used the term 'post-abortal upper genital tract infection', but in the summary of characteristics of included studies we have given the name for the primary outcome used by the trial authors, together with their diagnostic criteria.</LI>
<LI>For the intervention, we have used the general term 'antibiotic prophylaxis'. We used the term 'universal antibiotic prophylaxis' only if the trial report did not state that women were tested for genital infections at baseline and that women with positive results would be excluded or treated preoperatively. We did not define a time limit on the duration of the antibiotic regimen.</LI>

<P>The results of individual trials are presented as the relative risk (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) of post-abortal upper genital tract infection in women in the intervention group compared to those in the control group.</P>
<P>To examine evidence for publication and small study biases we drew funnel plots of log risk ratios against trial size (measured by standard error of the log risk ratio) and did a statistical test for asymmetry (<LINK REF="REF-Egger-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Egger 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>Where appropriate, we pooled data using meta-analysis in Stata (version 10, Stata Corporation, Austin, TX). We used the I-squared statistic to estimate the approximate proportion of total variability in point estimates that can be attributed to heterogeneity other than that due to chance (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2003</LINK>). We explored possible reasons for heterogeneity by stratifying study results according to the characteristics of the study populations (e.g. history of PID or chlamydia), the interventions (e.g. class of antibiotics used, route of administration, etc.), or methodological characteristics (adequate compared with inadequate random sequence generation, etc.). We also examined the role of methodological characteristics on the effect estimate using meta-regression to estimate the ratio of risk ratios. We used fixed-effects meta-analysis to estimate the common RR (95% CI), assuming that all or most between-trial variability is due to chance if there was little evidence of between-trial heterogeneity (I<SUP>2</SUP> &lt; 25%). In the presence of between-trial heterogeneity (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 25 to 75%) we used random-effects meta-analysis (Der Simonian Laird model) to estimate the average RR. In the text, we present both 95% CI, which express uncertainty around the average effect, which is assumed to be normally distributed, and the 95% prediction interval (PI), which takes into account the whole distribution of the effects (<LINK REF="REF-Riley-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Riley 2011</LINK>). We did not pool results if there was statistical evidence of severe between-trial heterogeneity (I<SUP>2</SUP> &gt; 75%).</P>

<B>Objective 1: Effectiveness of antibiotic prophylaxis in preventing post-abortal pelvic infection</B>
</P>
<P>There were 15 trials comparing any antibiotic regimen with placebo (<LINK REF="FIG-04" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 4</LINK>, <LINK REF="CMP-002.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.1</LINK>) (<LINK REF="STD-Crowley-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Crowley 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Darj-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Darj 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Heisterberg-1985a" TYPE="STUDY">Heisterberg 1985a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Heisterberg-1985b" TYPE="STUDY">Heisterberg 1985b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Heisterberg-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Heisterberg 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Heisterberg-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Heisterberg 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Krohn-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Krohn 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Krohn-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Krohn 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Larsson-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Larsson 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Larsson-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Larsson 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Levallois-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Levallois 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nielsen-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Nielsen 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sonne_x002d_Holm-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Sonne-Holm 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sorensen-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Sorensen 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Westrom-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Westrom 1981</LINK>). These trials included a total of 7025 women (median 378 patients, range 55 to 1276). Of these, 3525 women were randomised to the intervention arm receiving antibiotics and 3500 women to the control arm receiving placebo. A total of 203 patients in the intervention arms compared with 330 in the control arms developed upper genital tract infection, according to the authors' definitions.</P>
<P>
<I>Overall effectiveness of antibiotic prophylaxis</I>
</P>
<P>The pooled RR for all trials of any antibiotic regimen was 0.59 (95% CI 0.46 to 0.75; 95% PI 0.30 to 1.14) in random-effects meta-analysis. There was statistical evidence of heterogeneity between the trial results, with 39% of the variation in results due to factors other than chance. The results of individual trials ranged from: an 88% reduction in the incidence of post-abortal upper genital tract infection in women receiving three perioperative doses of doxycycline on the day of the abortion (3/536) compared with placebo (26/541) (RR 0.12, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.38) (<LINK REF="STD-Levallois-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Levallois 1988</LINK>), to no effect of a seven day course of lymecycline (25/269 women developed post-abortal upper genital tract infection compared with placebo (25/263) (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.66) (<LINK REF="STD-Heisterberg-1985a" TYPE="STUDY">Heisterberg 1985a</LINK>).</P>
<P>We examined potential reasons for heterogeneity in stratified analyses (<LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK>). In general, the magnitude of the effects of antibiotic prophylaxis in all strata was distributed around that of the overall pooled estimate, ranging from RR 0.5 to 0.7, representing a reduction in the risk of post-abortal upper genital tract infection of approximately 30-50%. Considering characteristics of the intervention and study populations, there was no evidence of between-trial heterogeneity (I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 0%) in RCTs that examined the effectiveness of nitroimidazole antibiotics (six trials) or penicillins (two trials), in trials using single doses of antibiotics (six trials), or in RCTs in which &#8805; 12% of women in the control group developed post-abortal upper genital tract infection (eight trials).</P>

Baseline cultures for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria were not taken. Amongst women included in analysis, the incidence of post-abortal upper genital tract infection was 2% (8/386) in women receiving doxycycline and 6% (24/383) in women receiving placebo (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.73).</P>

<P>
<B>Objective 3. To determine the most effective strategy for preventing post-abortal upper genital tract infection by comparing universal antibiotic prophylaxis with a screen-and-treat strategy, or with a combination of screen-and-treat plus universal prophylaxis</B>
</P>
<P>One trial compared the effectiveness of a screen-and-treat strategy with universal prophylaxis (<LINK REF="STD-Penney-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Penney 1998</LINK>). In the screen-and-treat arm, women were tested preoperatively for chlamydia, gonorrhoea and bacterial vaginosis; those with positive results received appropriate antibiotics for the infection(s) diagnosed (doxycycline, ciprofloxacin and metronidazole, respectively) and were referred to a genitourinary medicine clinic for partner notification. Women with negative screening tests did not receive any antibiotics. Women allocated to universal antibiotic prophylaxis received a single dose of 1 g metronidazole rectally on the day of the abortion followed by doxycycline 100 mg twice daily orally for seven days. A total of 1672 women was randomised but, owing to limited resources, this did not reach the planned number, according to the sample size calculation. The incidence of post-abortal upper genital tract infection was higher in women allocated to the screen-and-treat strategy compared to universal prophylaxis (RR 1.53, 95% CI 0.99 to 2.36) (<LINK REF="STD-Penney-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Penney 1998</LINK>). Of 45 women in the screen-and-treat group referred to a genitourinary medicine clinic, only 11 attended and only 4 out of 10 partners identified by these women were known to have attended the clinic for treatment.</P>

<P>
<B>Summary of main results</B>
</P>
<P>This systematic review included 19 RCTs that examined the effects of perioperative antibiotics to prevent post-abortal upper genital tract infection in women undergoing surgical abortion. In 15 of the 19 trials an antibiotic regimen was compared with placebo and demonstrated a decrease in post-abortal infection; however, only one of these trials appeared to use universal antibiotic prophylaxis without excluding women with genital infections at baseline (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.73). In four trials where it was unclear whether universal prophylaxis was used, the pooled RR was 0.49 (95% CI 0.32 to 0.75, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%, fixed-effect model). In 10 trials that excluded women with infections the protective effect of antibiotics was less pronounced and there was moderate between-trial heterogeneity (pooled RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.32 to 1.36, random-effects model, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 43%).</P>
<P>There were too few trials that compared different antibiotic regimens to determine the most effective regimen. No trials compared different antibiotic combinations to a single antibiotic or to another combination of antibiotics. It was not possible to determine whether a screen-and-treat strategy compared to universal antibiotic prophylaxis was more effective in preventing post-abortal upper genital tract infection as only one trial made this comparison (RR 1.53, 95% CI 0.99 to 2.36). This was the only trial in which partner notification for women with chlamydia or gonorrhoea was carried out; of 91 women with chlamydia, only 4 of 10 notified partners were known to have attended the same genitourinary medicine clinic for treatment.</P>
<P>We did not identify any RCTs examining the effect of antibiotic prophylaxis in women having medical abortion. None of the included RCTs was conducted in a low or middle income country.</P>
<P>
<B>Strengths and weaknesses</B>
</P>
<P>The main strengths of this review were that we considered different strategies for preventing post-abortal upper genital tract infection. We examined separately the strategies of universal antibiotic prophylaxis, in which antibiotics are given without taking tests for infections preoperatively and antibiotic prophylaxis in which women with specific infections were excluded or treated preoperatively. In this review, there were many differences between study populations, interventions, inclusion and exclusion criteria and diagnostic criteria so real heterogeneity was expected. We tried to take this into account in the presentation of results when there was evidence of moderate or severe heterogeneity (I<SUP>2 </SUP>&gt; 25%), using a strategy suggested by Riley and colleagues (<LINK REF="REF-Riley-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Riley 2011</LINK>). In these situations we presented 95% CI and a 95% PI, which describe the uncertainty around the intervention effect estimated in random-effects models. The estimate from the random-effects model is the average effect across the trials. Its CI expresses the statistical uncertainty around the average effect, not the potential effect in an individual population or setting, which may differ from the average. The PI reflects the range of effects across the different settings in which the trials were conducted (<LINK REF="REF-Riley-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Riley 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>A weakness of the review is the statistical evidence of publication or other small study biases in the 15 trials included in this review. This suggests that there might be trials with results showing no effect or a harmful effect of antibiotic prophylaxis in women presenting for first-trimester surgical abortion. The effect estimated in this review might, therefore, overestimate the prophylactic effect. Limitations of included studies include differences in the diagnostic criteria for both baseline infections (particularly bacterial vaginosis) and for the primary outcome of post-abortal upper genital tract infection (there are no agreed criteria), and duration of follow-up for diagnosing the primary outcome (two to eight weeks).</P>
<P>
<B>Comparison with other studies</B>
</P>
<P>This review updates and adds to information in the previous systematic review of antibiotic prophylaxis to prevent post-abortal upper genital tract infection, published by <LINK REF="REF-Sawaya-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sawaya 1996</LINK> and colleagues. The 12 trials studied by <LINK REF="REF-Sawaya-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sawaya 1996</LINK> were all identified in our searches and included in our review. Since our search strategy included more databases than that of Sawaya and colleagues, it is unlikely that we missed published trials. In addition to placebo controlled trials we also included trials comparing different antibiotic regimens and different prophylaxis strategies. Therefore, we included the only trial to compare the screen-and-treat strategy with universal antibiotic prophylaxis (<LINK REF="STD-Penney-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Penney 1998</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-Sawaya-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sawaya 1996</LINK> concluded that there has been strong evidence that antibiotics reduce the risk of post-abortal infection in all groups of women. This conclusion was based on a meta-analysis that used a fixed-effect model to estimate a pooled common RR of 0.58 (95% CI 0.47 to 0.71), despite marked between-trial heterogeneity. In this review, we quantify and explore the heterogeneous results between trials.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2012-02-03 14:02:17 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>A general strategy of perioperative antibiotics at the time of first-trimester surgical abortion is effective in preventing post-abortal upper genital tract infection, with an average reduction of 41% (95% CI 25 to 54%, random-effects model). The level of between trial heterogeneity suggests that this effect might not, however, apply to all settings, population groups or interventions. To take this into account, we also estimated a 95% PI, which is wider than the 95% CI (RR 0.59, 95% PI 0.30 to 1.14).</P>
<P>There are sub-groups amongst whom antibiotic prophylaxis had a beneficial effect, with no evidence of between trial heterogeneity: women receiving nitroimidazole antibiotics and single dose regimens; and settings in which the rate of post-abortal upper genital tract infection was 12% or more. In this review, there was a beneficial effect both in women with and without a history of PID.</P>
<P>The majority of trials included in the review did not evaluate a strategy of universal antibiotic prophylaxis as it would be applied in practice, i.e. giving prophylaxis to all women without doing tests to screen for existing gonorrhoea and chlamydia. This is because many trials had planned or actual exclusions (or treatment) of women who had infections diagnosed preoperatively. The prophylactic effect of antibiotics was actually weakest in the group of trials that did not use universal prophylaxis, perhaps because the opportunity to prevent post-abortal infections was reduced by the exclusion of those with infections. The antibiotic prophylactic regimen selected in practice should take into account the local epidemiology of lower genital tract infection.</P>
<P>This review did not determine the most effective antibiotic regimen because there were too few trials making such comparisons. In stratified analyses of placebo controlled trials nitroimidazoles prevented post-abortal upper genital tract infections with no evidence of between trial heterogeneity. Anaerobes or organisms associated with bacterial vaginosis might, therefore, be important aetiologically. In addition, two trials showed an effect of antibiotics active against chlamydia in women who were infected with <I>C. trachomatis </I>at baseline. Only one included trial used a combination of antibiotics; <LINK REF="STD-Penney-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Penney 1998</LINK> gave metronidazole and doxycycline. This antibiotic combination has been recommended in guidelines as it covers bacterial vaginosis and <I>C. trachomatis. </I>In a trial that was not included in the review because only half the women were in the first trimester, <LINK REF="STD-Miller-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 2004</LINK> compared a combination of a seven day course of metronidazole and doxycycline with doxycycline alone in women with bacterial vaginosis. They found that the addition of metronidazole did not reduce the incidence of post-abortal infectious complications, defined using a symptom score. Single dose regimens also appeared to be associated with a consistent reduction in the risk of post-abortal upper genital tract infection. Of note, four of these trials assessed the outcome at two weeks or sooner (<LINK REF="STD-Krohn-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Krohn 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Krohn-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Krohn 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nielsen-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Nielsen 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Westrom-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Westrom 1981</LINK>) and three of the trials used nitroimidazoles, which also showed a consistent effect (<LINK REF="STD-Crowley-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Crowley 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Krohn-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Krohn 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Westrom-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Westrom 1981</LINK>).</P>
<P>The findings of this review are consistent with existing guidelines on antibiotic prophylaxis. In the USA, the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology (<LINK REF="REF-ACOG-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">ACOG 2006</LINK>) did not recommend any particular regimen, whilst the Society of Family Planning states that both nitroimidazoles and tetracyclines are effective (<LINK REF="REF-Achilles-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Achilles 2011</LINK>). Guidance about the duration of the prophylactic regimen differs. The US Society of Family Planning recommends that antibiotics should not be given for more than three days (<LINK REF="REF-Achilles-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Achilles 2011</LINK>). In the UK, Royal College of Obstetrics and Gynaecology guidelines recommend single dose metronidazole with single dose azithromycin or a seven day course of doxycycline (<LINK REF="REF-RCOG-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">RCOG 2011</LINK>). The Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network has published general guidelines about antibiotic prophylaxis for surgical procedures and notes that in 'several studies... longer dose duration has no increased benefit' but no specific evidence about abortion was identified (<LINK REF="REF-SIGN-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">SIGN 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>The implications of lower genital tract infections that are sexually transmitted or sexually transmissible for women and their sex partner(s) should be taken into consideration when developing strategies for the prevention of post-abortal upper genital tract infection. If pre-abortion screening tests for infection are not done, practitioners should give women information about the specific infections not covered by the prophylactic regimen, so that they can seek diagnosis, treatment and partner services. If pre-abortion infection screening tests are done, practitioners should provide full treatment and follow-up care for women diagnosed with a sexually transmitted infection. The single trial by <LINK REF="STD-Penney-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Penney 1998</LINK> did not determine whether or not there is a difference in the effectiveness of screen-and-treat and universal antibiotic prophylaxis strategies. There were fewer episodes of post-abortal upper genital tract infection in women receiving universal antibiotic prophylaxis, but 95% CI were wide. Furthermore, the authors of the trial tried to ensure treatment for partners to prevent re-infection but very few were known to have attended a clinic for treatment. The implications of this for re-infection are not known; the low partner notification success rate could reflect an inability to reach partners in partnerships that had ended, or a failure to reach ongoing sex partners.</P>
<P>The results of the review cannot be generalised to women having medical abortions because we did not find any relevant trials.</P>
<P>The results of the review cannot be generalised to women in the second trimester of pregnancy because the protocol specified only first-trimester abortion. Future updates should include second-trimester abortion.</P>
<P>Since all included trials were conducted in high income countries where testing is available, the results cannot necessarily be generalised to low and middle income countries, where the prevalence of sexually transmitted and endogenous infections in women requesting abortion might well differ and where screening tests might not be available.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2012-01-23 22:40:46 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Further RCTs comparing prophylactic regimens of different antibiotics with each other or combinations of antibiotics with a single antibiotic would be useful. Such trials could be done in low and middle income countries and settings in which the prevalence of lower genital tract infections in women presenting for abortion is high.</P>
<P>Observational cohort studies of women who have had abortions could give valuable information about the risk of re-infection and of upper genital tract damage as longer term consequences of abortion. Follow-
up of RCTs could include a time period that is long enough to investigate the incidence of re-infection and the outcomes of partner notification, where appropriate, in women who have received antibiotic prophylaxis.</P>
<P>Further research to improve the accuracy and reproducibility of diagnostic criteria for upper genital tract infection would help to improve objective diagnosis.</P>
