<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2015-06-17 14:06:06 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>Antibiotics are administered to pregnant women during the second and third trimester of pregnancy (before labour) to prevent bacteria in the vagina and cervix affecting the pregnancy. Infection by some infectious organisms in a woman&#8217;s genital tract can cause health problems for the mother and her baby, and has been associated with preterm births. This review of eight randomised trials involved approximately 4300 women in their second or third trimester. We found that antibiotics did not reduce the risk of preterm prelabour rupture of the membranes (one trial, <I>low quality of evidence</I>), or the risk of preterm birth (six trials, high<I> quality of evidence</I>). Preterm delivery was reduced in pregnant women who had a previous preterm birth and an imbalance of bacteria in the vagina (bacterial vaginosis) during the current pregnancy. There was no reduction in preterm delivery in pregnant women with previous preterm birth without a bacterial imbalance during the current pregnancy (two trials). Postpartum endometritis, or infection of the uterus following birth, was reduced overall (three trials, <I>moderate quality of evidence</I>), as well as in a trial of high-risk women who had a previous preterm birth (one trial, <I>moderate quality of evidence</I>). No reduction in neonatal illness was observed. Outcomes of interest were available in trials with high losses to follow-up. We could not estimate the side effects of antibiotics since side effects were rare; however, antibiotics may still have serious side effects on women and their babies.</P>
<P>There is, therefore, no justification to give antibiotics to all pregnant women during the second or third trimester to prevent adverse infectious effects on pregnancy outcomes.</P>

<P>The review included eight randomised controlled trials. Approximately 4300 women were recruited to detect the effect of prophylactic antibiotic administration on pregnancy outcomes.</P>
<P>
<B>Primary outcomes</B>
</P>
<P>Antibiotic prophylaxis did not reduce the risk of preterm prelabour rupture of membranes (risk ratio (RR) 0.31; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.06 to 1.49 (one trial, 229 women), <I>low quality evidence</I>) or preterm delivery (RR 0.88; 95% CI 0.72 to 1.09 (six trials, 3663 women), high<I> quality evidence</I>). However, preterm delivery was reduced in the subgroup of pregnant women with a previous preterm birth who had bacterial vaginosis (BV) during the current pregnancy (RR 0.64; 95% CI 0.47 to 0.88 (one trial, 258 women)), but there was no reduction in the subgroup of pregnant women with previous preterm birth without BV during the pregnancy (RR 1.08; 95% CI 0.66 to 1.77 (two trials, 500 women)). A reduction in the risk of postpartum endometritis (RR 0.55; 95% CI 0.33 to 0.92 (one trial, 196 women)) was observed in high-risk pregnant women (women with a history of preterm birth, low birthweight, stillbirth or early perinatal death) and in all women (RR 0.53; 95% CI 0.35 to 0.82 (three trials, 627 women), <I>moderate quality evidence</I>). There was no difference in low birthweight (RR 0.86; 95% CI 0.53 to 1.39 (four trials; 978 women)) or neonatal sepsis (RR 11.31; 95% CI 0.64 to 200.79) (one trial, 142 women)); and blood culture confirming sepsis was not reported in any of the studies.</P>
<P>
<B>Secondary outcomes</B>
</P>
<P>Antibiotic prophylaxis reduced the risk of prelabour rupture of membranes (RR 0.34; 95% CI 0.15 to 0.78 (one trial, 229 women), <I>low quality evidence</I>) and gonococcal infection (RR 0.35; 95% CI 0.13 to 0.94 (one trial, 204 women)). There were no differences observed in other secondary outcomes (congenital abnormality; small-for-gestational age; perinatal mortality), whilst many other secondary outcomes (e.g. intrapartum fever needing treatment with antibiotics) were not reported in included trials.</P>
<P>Regarding the route of antibiotic administration, vaginal antibiotic prophylaxis during pregnancy did not prevent infectious pregnancy outcomes. The overall risk of bias was low, except that incomplete outcome data produced high risk of bias in some studies. The quality of the evidence using GRADE was assessed as low for preterm prelabour rupture of membranes, high for preterm delivery, moderate for postpartum endometritis, low for prelabour rupture of membranes, and very low for chorioamnionitis. Intrapartum fever needing treatment with antibiotics was not reported in any of the included studies.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2015-06-19 10:26:55 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Leanne V Jones">
<P>Antibiotic prophylaxis did not reduce the risk of preterm prelabour rupture of membranes or preterm delivery (apart from in the subgroup of women with a previous preterm birth who had bacterial vaginosis). Antibiotic prophylaxis given during the second or third trimester of pregnancy reduced the risk of postpartum endometritis, term pregnancy with pre-labour rupture of membranes and gonococcal infection when given routinely to all pregnant women. Substantial bias possibly exists in the review's results because of a high rate of loss to follow-up and the small numbers of studies included in each of our analyses. There is also insufficient evidence on possible harmful effects on the baby. Therefore, we conclude that there is not enough evidence to support the use of routine antibiotics during pregnancy to prevent infectious adverse effects on pregnancy outcomes.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2015-06-17 14:09:46 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2015-06-17 14:09:31 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>Female genital tract infection can be caused by various organisms and could be due to acquisition, overgrowth, or ascending of the normal flora from the lower genital tract into the uterine cavity.</P>
<P>Maternal genital tract infection or colonisation by some infectious organisms can cause maternal and perinatal mortality and morbidity. Preterm delivery is the most common cause of perinatal morbidity and mortality in the world. Moreover, prematurity is implicated in at least two-thirds of early infant deaths (<LINK REF="REF-Cunningham-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cunningham 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>A large number of medical and demographic factors have been implicated in the aetiology of preterm birth. These can be categorised into four groups:</P>
<OL>
<LI>medical and obstetric complications (e.g. hypertensive disorders, placental haemorrhage);</LI>
<LI>lifestyle factors (e.g. cigarette smoking, poor nutrition);</LI>
<LI>amniotic fluid infection caused by a variety of micro-organisms located in the genital tract;</LI>
<LI>cervical incompetence.</LI>
</OL>
<P>Approximately one-third of preterm births have been associated with chorioamniotic infection (<LINK REF="REF-Lettieri-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lettieri 1993</LINK>). Many micro-organisms have been suggested as the cause of preterm prelabour rupture of membranes, preterm labour, or both; for example, bacterial vaginosis, <I>Trichomonas vaginalis</I>, <I>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</I>, <I>Ureaplasma urealyticum</I>, <I>Chlamydia trachomatis</I> and Group B streptococci (<LINK REF="REF-Braun-1971" TYPE="REFERENCE">Braun 1971</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gravett-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gravett 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hardy-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hardy 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hillier-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hillier 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Regan-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Regan 1981</LINK>). Case detection and treatment in pregnant women is problematic and expensive, emphasising the need for other strategies. Considering the association between preterm births and infection, prophylactic antibiotics seem to be a logical strategy for preventing preterm births, although the effectiveness of prophylactic antibiotics for which population should be given is still not clear (e.g., all women or only high-risk women).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2015-01-09 11:41:15 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>Antibiotic prophylaxis is used for prevention of infection and reduces the risk of sequelae of infection. Antibiotics used for prophylaxis should be initiated before documented infection. Antibiotic use during pregnancy is not without possible risk. Long-term follow-up of children whose mothers were randomly allocated to antibiotics versus placebo for suspected preterm labour with intact membranes were found to have an increased risk of cerebral palsy at seven years of age (<LINK REF="REF-Kenyon-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kenyon 2008</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2015-06-17 14:09:46 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>Infections and related complications in pregnancy and childbirth are potentially preventable. However, the appropriate intervention is yet to be identified. Routine antenatal detection and treatment of infections, especially in countries with a high prevalence, would seem the most reasonable approach. Limited laboratory facilities make this strategy unrealistic in low-resource settings. Diagnosis algorithms, including clinical signs and symptoms, and behavioural patterns, are sometimes used for quick identification of infections for prompt care. Unfortunately, despite the fact that this approach may be useful in countries with limited resources, diagnostic algorithms have low sensitivity, predictive values and validity. In a situation where realistic options are few, a strategy of routine antibiotic prophylaxis might be a worthwhile alternative.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2014-10-09 14:20:02 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The available body of literature on prophylactic antibiotics in pregnancy has yielded conflicting results. While some studies demonstrated that prophylactic antibiotic administration in pregnancy improved maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality, other studies could not confirm this finding (<LINK REF="REF-Eschenbach-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eschenbach 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McCormack-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">McCormack 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Morales-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morales 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Newton-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Newton 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Oleszczuk-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oleszczuk 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Romero-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Romero 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Romero-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Romero 1993</LINK>). It is in view of this uncertainty that there is a need for a systematic review of the results of randomised controlled trials of antibiotic prophylaxis in pregnancy.</P>

<LI>low risk of bias (where it is clear that all of the study's prespecified outcomes and all expected outcomes of interest to the review have been reported);</LI>
<LI>high risk of bias (where not all the study's prespecified outcomes have been reported; one or more reported primary outcomes were not prespecified; outcomes of interest are reported incompletely and so cannot be used; study fails to include results of a key outcome that would have been expected to have been reported);</LI>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Assessment of the quality of the evidence</HEADING>
<P>For this update, we assessed the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach (<LINK REF="REF-Schunemann-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schunemann 2009</LINK>) in order to assess the quality of the body of evidence relating to the following key outcomes for the main comparison.</P>

<P>We used GRADEprofiler (<LINK REF="REF-GRADEpro-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">GRADEpro 2014</LINK>) to import data from Review Manager 5.3 (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2014</LINK>) in order to create a &#8217;Summary of findings&#8217; table. We produced a summary of the intervention effect and a measure of quality for each of the above outcomes using the GRADE approach. The GRADE approach uses five considerations (study limitations, consistency of effect, imprecision, indirectness and publication bias) to assess the quality of the body of evidence for each outcome. The evidence can be downgraded from 'high quality' by one level for serious (or by two levels for very serious) limitations, depending on assessments for risk of bias, indirectness of evidence, serious inconsistency, imprecision of effect estimates or potential publication bias.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Cluster-randomised trials</HEADING>
<P>We intended to include cluster-randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in the analyses along with individually-randomised trials. Although we could not find any cluster-RCTs for this version of the review. In future updates, if identified, we will adjust their sample sizes using the methods described in the <I>Handbook</I> <I>[Section 16.3.4 or 16.3.6]</I> using an estimate of the intracluster correlation co-efficient (ICC) derived from the trial (if possible), from a similar trial or from a study of a similar population. If we use ICCs from other sources, we will report this and conduct sensitivity analyses to investigate the effect of variation in the ICC. If we identify both cluster-RCTs and individually-randomised trials, we plan to synthesise the relevant information. We will consider it reasonable to combine the results from both if there is little heterogeneity between the study designs and the interaction between the effect of intervention and the choice of randomisation unit is considered to be unlikely.</P>
<P>We would also acknowledge heterogeneity in the randomisation unit and perform a sensitivity analysis to investigate the effects of the randomisation unit.</P>

<MISSING_DATA MODIFIED="2015-06-17 14:24:57 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>For included studies, we noted levels of attrition. In future updates, if more eligible studies are included, we will explore the impact of including studies with high levels of missing data in the overall assessment of treatment effect by using sensitivity analysis.</P>
<P>For all outcomes, we carried out analyses, as far as possible, on an intention-to-treat basis, i.e. we attempted to include all participants randomised to each group in the analyses. The denominator for each outcome in each trial was the number randomised minus any participants whose outcomes were known to be missing.</P>

<HETEROGENEITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2015-01-09 11:43:10 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>We assessed statistical heterogeneity in each meta-analysis using the Tau, I and Chi statistics. We regarded heterogeneity as substantial if an I was greater than 30% and either the Tau was greater than zero, or there was a low P value (less than 0.10) in the Chi test for heterogeneity. Had we identified substantial heterogeneity (above 30%), we planned to explore it by prespecified subgroup analysis. </P>

</BIAS_ASSESSMENT>
<DATA_SYNTHESIS MODIFIED="2015-01-09 11:52:17 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>We carried out statistical analysis using the Review Manager software (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2014</LINK>). We used fixed-effect meta-analysis for combining data where it was reasonable to assume that studies were estimating the same underlying treatment effect: i.e. where trials were examining the same intervention, and the trials&#8217; populations and methods were judged sufficiently similar.</P>
<P>Where there was clinical heterogeneity sufficient to expect that the underlying treatment effects differed between trials, or if substantial statistical heterogeneity was detected, we used random-effects meta-analysis to produce an overall summary, if an average treatment effect across trials was considered clinically meaningful. The random-effects summary was treated as the average range of possible treatment effects and we discussed the clinical implications of treatment effects differing between trials. If the average treatment effect was not clinically meaningful, we did not combine trials. Where we used random-effects analyses, the results were presented as the average treatment effect with 95% confidence intervals, and the estimates of Tau and I.</P>
</DATA_SYNTHESIS>
<SUBGROUP_ANALYSIS MODIFIED="2015-06-17 14:16:25 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>Where we identified substantial heterogeneity, we investigated it using subgroup analyses. We considered whether an overall summary was meaningful, and if it was, we used random-effects analysis to produce it.</P>
<P>We carried out subgroup analyses on the high-risk group: that is, the group of pregnant women who may be at risk of having the primary outcomes, including those with a history of preterm delivery, a history of genital tract and urinary tract infection.</P>
<P>For the previous update (<LINK REF="REF-Thinkhamrop-2015a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thinkhamrop 2015a</LINK>), 'high risk' was defined as women who had a previous spontaneous preterm delivery, history of low birthweight, a diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis (BV) in the current pregnancy (BV identified after enrolment and antibiotics used only for prophylaxis before knowing if the participant had BV or not), or a pre-pregnancy weight less than 50 kg.</P>
<P>All outcomes were used in subgroup analyses.</P>
<P>We assessed subgroup differences by interaction tests available within RevMan (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2014</LINK>). We reported the results of subgroup analyses quoting the Chi statistic and P value, and the interaction test I value.</P>

<P>We did not conduct sensitivity analysis in this version of the review.

<P>One study (<LINK REF="STD-Temmerman-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Temmerman 1995</LINK>) had a high drop-out rate (166 (41.5%) out of 400 women enrolled).

<P>We included eight randomised controlled trials with a total of approximately 4300 women to evaluate the effect of prophylactic antibiotic administration in the second or third trimester on pregnancy outcomes. We found many studies on the topic of antibiotic use to prevent preterm delivery, but unlike the included studies, these studies focused on antibiotic treatment given after there was evidence of infection or complications of pregnancy; for example, detection of bacterial vaginosis (BV) or prelabour rupture of membranes before administration of antibiotics. These studies were therefore identified as trials of treatment and not prophylaxis. Publication of the included studies took place over more than 15 years (1990 to 2009). Three trials with a total of 1019 women (<LINK REF="STD-Gichangi-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Gichangi 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hauth-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Hauth 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vermeulen-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Vermeulen 1999</LINK>) enrolled only high-risk pregnant women. 'High risk' was defined as women who had a previous spontaneous preterm delivery, history of low birthweight, a diagnosis of BV in the current pregnancy (BV identified after enrolment and antibiotics used only for prophylaxis before knowing if the participant had BV or not). or a pre-pregnancy weight less than 50 kg. Seven studies used oral antibiotics: erythromycin alone (<LINK REF="STD-McGregor-1990" TYPE="STUDY">McGregor 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Paul-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Paul 1997</LINK>); erythromycin plus metronidazole (<LINK REF="STD-Hauth-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Hauth 1995</LINK>); cefetamet-pivoxil (<LINK REF="STD-Gichangi-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Gichangi 1997</LINK>); or a combination of metronidazole and cephalexin (<LINK REF="STD-Sen-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Sen 2005</LINK>), and azithromycin (<LINK REF="STD-Van-den-Broek-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Van den Broek 2009</LINK>). One study used ceftriaxone intramuscular injection (<LINK REF="STD-Temmerman-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Temmerman 1995</LINK>); and one used clindamycin vaginal cream application (<LINK REF="STD-Vermeulen-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Vermeulen 1999</LINK>).</P>

<P>Studies of antibiotic prophylaxis during the second or third trimester (ranging from 14 to 34 weeks of gestational age) in pregnant women reported the primary outcomes of interest as the following: preterm prelabour rupture of membranes, preterm delivery, postpartum endometritis, low birthweight and neonatal sepsis. Blood culture confirming sepsis was not reported in any of the studies.</P>
<P>Antibiotic prophylaxis did not reduce the risk of preterm prelabour rupture of membranes (average risk ratio (RR) 0.31; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.06 to 1.49 (one trial, 229 women) <LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>) or preterm delivery (average RR 0.88; 95% CI 0.72 to 1.09 (six trials, 3663 women) <LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK> all women; average RR 0.97; 95% CI 0.82 to 1.15 (four trials, 2905 women) <LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>.1 unselected women).

<P>A reduction in the risk of postpartum endometritis (RR 0.55; 95% CI 0.33 to 0.92 (one trial, 196 women)) was observed in high-risk pregnant women (women with a history of preterm birth, low birthweight, stillbirth or early perinatal death) <LINK REF="CMP-001.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.4</LINK>,2, and in all women (RR 0.53; 95% CI 0.35 to 0.82 (three trials, 627 women) <LINK REF="CMP-001.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.4</LINK>), but not in unselected women (RR 0.51; 95% CI 0.24 to 1.08 (two trials, 431 women) <LINK REF="CMP-001.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.4</LINK>.1.

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Secondary outcomes</HEADING>
<P>A reduction was observed in preterm rupture of membranes (RR 0.34; 95% CI 0.15 to 0.78; one trial; 229 women; <LINK REF="CMP-001.07" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.7</LINK>) and gonococcal infection (postpartum detected) (RR 0.35, 95% CI 0.13 to 0.94; one trial; 204 women; <LINK REF="CMP-001.09" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.9</LINK>) in the group of women who received antibiotic prophylaxis. Other secondary outcomes did not show any significant effects (chorioamnionitis; compliance; mean gestational age; mean birthweight; congenital abnormality; small-for-gestational age; perinatal mortality). The included studies did not report any serious adverse effects of antibiotic prophylaxis, and no data were reported on some maternal outcomes that we had planned to assess, including intrapartum fever requiring treatment with antibiotics, serious maternal complications (puerperal infection requiring laparotomy for infection or hysterectomy; death), maternal side effects, duration of hospital stay and satisfaction with care. We observed a lack of data to assess congenital abnormality and perinatal mortality. We also found limited data to evaluate the effect of antibiotics on low birthweight in unselected women. There were four trials in this analysis: three reported on an unselected population and the other reported in a high-risk group, which had effects in opposite directions. We found no data on the following neonatal outcomes: admission to neonatal intensive care unit; ophthalmia neonatorum; and abnormal neurological development.</P>
<P>There was only one included study (<LINK REF="STD-Vermeulen-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Vermeulen 1999</LINK>) that used vaginal application for antibiotic prophylaxis.

<P>One study (<LINK REF="STD-McGregor-1990" TYPE="STUDY">McGregor 1990</LINK>) reported that compliance with medication was different between groups (73% in the treatment group versus 84% in the control group).

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-06-17 14:18:49 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>The results of this review showed that antibiotic prophylaxis during the second or third trimester of pregnancy was effective in reducing risk of preterm delivery in pregnant women with bacterial vaginosis (BV) in the current pregnancy, prelabour rupture of membranes, postpartum endometritis and gonococcal infection (detected postpartum). However, some analyses are based on studies with high risk of bias or only one trial. Limited data showed that routine use of antibiotics during pregnancy might prevent infectious morbidity for the mother, but could not reduce neonatal morbidity and mortality. We could not estimate the side effects of prophylactic antibiotics from these data, since side effects from prophylactic antibiotics are rare events.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2015-06-01 12:44:04 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>None of the included studies reported on preterm labour, serious maternal complications of puerperal infection requiring laparotomy, maternal side effects of antibiotic prophylaxis (severe side effect), duration of hospitalisation, satisfaction with care, blood culture confirming neonatal sepsis or opthalmia neonatorum. However, these outcomes are not the outcomes we expected when evaluating the effectiveness of the intervention. Some included studies reported the expected outcomes, such as preterm delivery, preterm prelabour rupture of membranes, prelabour rupture of membranes, chorioamnionitis, puerperal sepsis, postpartum endometritis, mean gestational age, low birthweight, admission to neonatal intensive care unit and perinatal mortality. Nevertheless, the power of the available studies is inadequate to provide conclusions about some rare but serious outcomes such as chorioamnionitis, intrapartum fever requiring antibiotic treatment, neonatal sepsis, admission to the intensive neonatal care unit and perinatal mortality. However, an ongoing study (<LINK REF="STD-Hoffman-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Hoffman 2013</LINK>) plans to enrol 1726 women which, once completed, might add more power to the assessment of these rare outcomes.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2015-06-17 14:18:57 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>Overall, the methodological quality of the included trials was satisfactory. Of the eight trials included, six described methods which were at low risk for selection bias, five were at low risk for performance bias, and four had low risk of incomplete outcome data. However, some outcomes of interest were only available in trials with high risk of incomplete outcome data and high rate of loss to follow-up. Furthermore, most outcomes of interest were found in only one to two studies, meaning that the sample size might not be large enough to demonstrate key differences.</P>
<P>The rate of loss to follow-up in the included studies was quite high (20% to 40%), especially for studies that reported on puerperal sepsis/postpartum endometritis. Since puerperal sepsis/postpartum endometritis had the significant beneficial effect of antibiotic prophylaxis administration during pregnancy, we are reluctant to recommend the use of this intervention due to this potential bias.</P>
<P>The quality of the evidence as assessed using GRADE was moderate for postpartum endometritis, and was downgraded due to a small sample size in one study. After including <LINK REF="STD-Van-den-Broek-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Van den Broek 2009</LINK> trial, the quality of evidence for preterm delivery was upgraded to high quality. Low-quality evidence was also observed for preterm prelabour rupture of membranes, and prelabour rupture of membranes due to small sample size, wide confidence intervals crossing the line of no effect, and the design limitations of one study. Very low quality of evidence was also found for chorioamnionitis due to the design limitations of one study, few events and small sample size and wide confidence intervals crossing the line of no effect.

<P>Most outcomes of interest in this review revealed no evidence of effectiveness of the intervention, with the same direction of effect as individual studies. However, those outcome assessments were available in only one or two studies. Of the outcomes of interest that revealed evidence of effectiveness (preterm delivery in pregnant women with BV in the current pregnancy, prelabour rupture of membranes, postpartum endometritis and postpartum detection of gonococcal infection), only postpartum endometritis had three included studies relevant to our analysis, while two of these three individual studies showed no significant effectiveness.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2015-06-17 14:19:05 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>Routine use of antibiotic prophylaxis in pregnant women during the second and third trimester could prevent maternal infectious morbidity by reducing postpartum endometritis. We observed risk reduction in preterm delivery only in pregnant women with bacterial vaginosis (BV) during the current pregnancy, but there was a lack of evidence showing any benefits for neonatal morbidity and mortality. We also noted a possible substantial bias in the review's results due to a high rate of loss to follow-up. The evidence is not strong enough to support routine use of antibiotics in the second and third trimester to prevent infectious complications.<BR/>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2014-10-28 11:18:01 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Sonja L Henderson">
<P>The results of this review suggest that antibiotic prophylaxis might only be effective in reducing maternal puerperal infection. Due to limited data, we could not evaluate any benefits for neonatal morbidity and mortality. In addition, data were lacking on some health outcomes such as short- and long-term effects on children. Therefore, there is a need for further studies to address these missing gaps in the evidence.</P>

<P>The study included pregnant women with positive fetal fibronectin. The authors mentioned in the study's objective that they planned to estimate the antibiotic treatment effects in asymptomatic women with a positive cervical or vaginal fetal fibronectin test to reduce the risk of spontaneous preterm delivery. Fetal fibronectin is a placental and membrane protein that is a unique epitope of the fibronectins. One hypothesis holds that intrauterine infection causes disruption of the extracellular choriodecidual basement membrane, causing leakage of fetal fibronectin into cervical or vaginal secretions, in which it can then be detected. This might imply that antibiotic usage in this situation is for treatment not for prophylaxis.</P>

<P>Pregnant women were enrolled at varying gestations, and treatment could not be provided on a fixed schedule during pregnancy. In this trial, the intervention was given to 529 women in the first half of gestation and to 851 women in the second half of gestation. This is unlikely to have introduced bias to the comparison between randomisation arms because the trimester of enrolment was similar in the two arms. Nevertheless, the variable timing of treatment during pregnancy may have reduced the efficacy of antibiotics on adverse pregnancy outcomes, especially if the antibiotic prophylaxis was given in the first trimester.</P>
