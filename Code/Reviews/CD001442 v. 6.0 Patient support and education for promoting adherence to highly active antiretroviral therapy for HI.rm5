<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>People living with HIV/AIDS are required to achieve high levels of adherence to benefit from many antiretroviral regimens. This review identified 19 studies involving a total of 2,159 participants that evaluated an intervention intended to improve adherence. Ten of these studies demonstrated a beneficial effect of the intervention. We found that interventions targeting practical medication management skills, those administered to individuals vs groups, and those interventions delivered over 12 weeks or more were associated with improved adherence to antiretroviral therapy. We also found that interventions targeting marginalized populations such as women, Latinos, or patients with a past history of alcoholism were not successful at improving adherence. We did not find studies that evaluated the quality of the patient-provider relationship or the clinical setting. Most studies had several methodological shortcomings.</P>

</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Adherence to prescribed regimens is required to derive maximal benefit from many highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) regimens in people living with HIV/AIDS.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To conduct a systematic review of the research literature on the effectiveness of patient support and education to improve adherence to HAART.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>A systematic search of electronic databases was performed from January 1996 to May 2005.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomized controlled trials examining the effectiveness of patient support and education to improve adherence to HAART were considered for inclusion. Only those studies that measured adherence at a minimum of six weeks were included.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Study selection, quality assessments and data abstraction were performed independently by two reviewers.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Nineteen studies involving a total of 2,159 participants met criteria for inclusion. It was not possible to conduct a meta-analysis due to study heterogeneity with respect to populations, interventions, comparison groups, outcomes, and length of follow-up. Sample sizes ranged from 22 to 367. The populations studied ranged from general HIV-positive populations to studies focusing exclusively on children, women, Latinos, or adults with a history of alcohol dependence, to studies focusing almost exclusively on men. Study interventions included cognitive behavioral therapy, motivational interviewing, medication management strategies, and interventions indirectly targeting adherence, such as programs directed to reduce risky sexual behaviours. Ten studies demonstrated a beneficial effect of the intervention on adherence. We found that interventions targeting practical medication management skills, those administered to individuals vs groups, and those interventions delivered over 12 weeks or more were associated with improved adherence outcomes. We also found that interventions targeting marginalized populations such as women, Latinos, or patients with a past history of alcoholism were not successful at improving adherence. We were unable to determine whether effective adherence interventions were associated with improved virological or immunological outcomes. Most studies had several methodological shortcomings leaving them vulnerable to potential biases.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>We found evidence to support the effectiveness of patient support and education interventions intended to improve adherence to antiretroviral therapy. Interventions targeting practical medication management skills, those interventions administered to individuals vs groups, and those interventions delivered over 12 weeks or more were associated with improved adherence outcomes. There is a need for standardization and increased methodological rigour in the conduct of adherence trials.</P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
</ABSTRACT>
<BODY>
<BACKGROUND>
<P>High adherence to antiretroviral therapy is a key determinant of the degree and durability of viral suppression (<LINK REF="REF-Paterson-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Paterson 2000</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Yeni-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yeni 2002</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Yeni-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yeni 2004</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Gross-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gross 2001</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Wood-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wood 2003</LINK>) and has been associated with lower rates of disease progression, hospitalization, and mortality (<LINK REF="STD-Press-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Press 2002</LINK>). In contrast, poor adherence correlates with treatment failure (<LINK REF="REF-Yeni-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yeni 2002</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Nieuwkerk-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nieuwkerk 2001</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Haubrich-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Haubrich 1999</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Knobel-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Knobel 2001</LINK>) and can limit options for future antiretroviral therapies due to cross-resistance between HIV drugs. Thus, even brief periods of non-adherence to certain antiretrovirals can have lifelong implications (<LINK REF="STD-Perno-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Perno 2002</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Wainberg-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wainberg 1998</LINK>). Complicated HIV regimens, medication side effects and toxicities, high pill burdens, and psychosocial factors all contribute to non-adherence for persons on HAART (<LINK REF="REF-Singh-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Singh 1999</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Ferguson-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ferguson 2002</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Carpenter-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carpenter 2000</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Ickovics-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Ickovics 2002</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Catz-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Catz 2000</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Ammassari-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Ammassari 2002</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Golin-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Golin 2002</LINK>). Patient characteristics and the nature of health-care delivery are additional contributors (<LINK REF="STD-Ickovics-2002a" TYPE="STUDY">Ickovics 2002a</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Ickovics-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ickovics 1997</LINK>). </P>
<P>Previous studies have demonstrated that the rates of non-adherence for medications within the general population can range from 15% to 93%, with the average rate being 50% non-adherence for chronic health conditions (<LINK REF="REF-Haynes-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haynes 1979</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-McDonald-2002" TYPE="STUDY">McDonald 2002</LINK>). In a study of HIV treatment naïve patients, 95% adherence was associated with maximal therapeutic effects of antiretroviral therapy; however, only 30% of patients in the study were able to attain this level (<LINK REF="REF-Paterson-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Paterson 2000</LINK>). While the optimal level of adherence may vary across regimens, strategies to improve adherence remain particularly important for persons taking antiretroviral medications.</P>
<P>Few systematic reviews of interventions to improve adherence to antiretroviral therapy have been published. Early reviews yielded a limited number of underpowered or poor quality studies (<LINK REF="STD-Haddad-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Haddad 2000</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Fogarty-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Fogarty 2002</LINK>) and were inconclusive (<LINK REF="STD-Ickovics-2002a" TYPE="STUDY">Ickovics 2002a</LINK>). More recent reviews have reported preliminary success of several interventions while reiterating the need for more rigour in the conduct of intervention trials (<LINK REF="REF-Cote-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cote 2005</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Simoni-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Simoni 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Simoni-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Simoni 2006</LINK>) . The most recent systematic review, which described the literature to December 2004 and performed a meta-analysis of studies using between- and within-group designs, found that the average intervention had a small and variable effect on adherence and that stronger effects were demonstrated in populations with poor baseline adherence (<LINK REF="REF-Amico-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Amico 2006</LINK>). However, this review included uncontrolled studies and excluded controlled studies that did not provide enough information to calculate an effect size.</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>To conduct a systematic review of the research literature on the effectiveness of patient support strategies and education for improving adherence to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) in people living with HIV/AIDS.</P>
</OBJECTIVES>
<METHODS>
<SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<CRIT_STUDIES>
<P>We only considered randomized controlled trials (RCTs) for inclusion in this review because they are considered the gold standard to assess the effects of interventions. Carefully planned and properly conducted RCTs are thought to provide the highest strength of evidence to establish causality, considering their ability to minimize potential biases by controlling for both known and unknown confounding factors.</P>
</CRIT_STUDIES>
<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>Studies of people infected with HIV and receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) were included. HAART was defined as at least three antiretroviral drugs consisting of: at least one protease inhibitor; at least one non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor; or three or more nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, of which one was abacavir. We included studies of adults and children in which at least 80% of the study population had been prescribed HAART.</P>
</CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>We considered support- and education-based interventions intended to improve adherence to HAART. The interventions, which could be directed to individuals or groups, included all types of patient education, counseling, support, health promotion, reminders, provision of resources, supervision, consultation, and telephone hotlines. We imposed no criteria concerning the "dose" or intensity of the intervention, but the control arm had to receive usual or standard adherence support or an alternate intervention of any type.</P>
</CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<CRIT_OUTCOMES>
<P>We included studies that measured and reported at least one measure of adherence to HAART for both the intervention and control arms at least 6 weeks after study initiation. Possible measures included electronic monitoring, pill counts, medication diaries, patient self-report, provider report, clinic and pharmacy records. Dropouts or withdrawals from drug trials were not considered measures of adherence. We recorded immunologic and virologic outcomes as secondary endpoints when available, but these were not a requirement for study selection.</P>
</CRIT_OUTCOMES>
</SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<SEARCH_METHODS>
<P>Electronic Databases<BR/>The search strategy covered the literature from January 1996 (following the introduction of the first protease inhibitor) to May 2005. We made minor modifications to the search strategy over time to update the list of antiretroviral medications. We searched the following databases: Medline, CINAHL, HEALTHSTAR, Cochrane CENTRAL, PsycInfo, EMBASE, International Pharmaceutical Abstracts, Sociological Abstracts and Science Citation Index. </P>
<P>Conference Proceedings<BR/>We also searched the following conference databases in the same time frame: Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections (CROI), International AIDS Conference, International AIDS Society (IAS), Interscience Conference on Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy (ICAAC), and the Canadian Association of HIV/AIDS Research (CAHR).</P>
<P>We employed the following librarian-developed search strategy to identify studies relevant to the review. The strategy was modified as required for various databases.</P>

</SEARCH_METHODS>
<DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Study Selection<BR/>Two reviewers independently assessed the studies for potential relevance by reading the abstract and title to eliminate obvious exclusions. If the abstract was unavailable, the full text paper was retrieved. We used a customized form reflecting the selection criteria to facilitate the selection process. Studies published in all languages were considered for inclusion. </P>
<P>Full-text versions of the papers identified from the abstract screening process were subsequently retrieved and assessed independently by two reviewers for inclusion in the review. Full-text papers were not examined in cases where both reviewers agreed that the study did not meet inclusion criteria. In the case of uncertainty regarding the relevance of a study, the authors of the study were contacted to clarify the necessary aspects of the study design. When disagreements about the relevance of a study emerged, the reviewers met to discuss their disagreement until consensus was reached. If consensus could not be reached, a third reviewer was available to arbitrate the decision. References from retrieved studies were also reviewed in an attempt to locate additional relevant studies. </P>
<P>Data Abstraction <BR/>Data abstraction was performed independently by two reviewers. We attempted to contact study authors to obtain data identified as missing during data abstraction. Disagreements were discussed between the reviewers until consensus was reached. If consensus could not be reached, a third reviewer was invited to settle the disagreement. </P>
<P>Quality Assessment<BR/>The methodological quality was appraised for the included studies. The purpose of this appraisal was not to exclude studies based on a pre-determined cut-off, but to discuss the overall quality of the studies available for inclusion. We created a list of quality criteria, based on Sackett (<LINK REF="REF-Sackett-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sackett 1979</LINK>) and the Consort Statement (<LINK REF="REF-Moher-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 2001</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Altman-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Altman 2001</LINK>), outlining the following important design issues specific to adherence enhancing intervention studies: </P>
<P>Randomization Method: The method used to generate the random allocation sequence was described and appropriate. We were unable to judge whether or not the randomization method was appropriate when the authors used the following terms without elaboration: random, randomization, or random allocation. Following the Consort Statement (item 8a) (<LINK REF="REF-Moher-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 2001</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Altman-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Altman 2001</LINK>), several sequence generation methods were considered appropriate, including the use of a random-number table or a computerized random-number generator. </P>
<P>Allocation Concealment: The method used to implement the random allocation sequence needed to be described and appropriate. This criterion refers to the requirement that the investigators or clinicians should not have prior information of the treatment group to which the patient would be randomized. Following the Consort Statement (<LINK REF="REF-Moher-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 2001</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Altman-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Altman 2001</LINK>) (item 9), the authors needed to clarify whether or not the allocation sequence was concealed until the groups were assigned. The best methods to allocation concealment include the involvement of external sources, such as a central telephone randomization system. We also considered the use of opaque, sealed envelopes to be an appropriate concealment mechanism. </P>
<P>Objective Measure of Adherence: Subjective measures of adherence, such as patient self-report, are commonly used but tend to yield overestimates (<LINK REF="REF-Sackett-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sackett 1979</LINK>). Objective measures of adherence include electronic monitoring, pill counts, pharmacy or clinic medication data, and direct observation. </P>
<P>Attention Control: Control patients should receive similar contact time with the adherence support provider as patients receiving the intervention (<LINK REF="REF-Sackett-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sackett 1979</LINK>). Otherwise, the observed effects may be due to either the intervention or the non-specific effects of the increased attention paid to the intervention group (<LINK REF="STD-McDonald-2002" TYPE="STUDY">McDonald 2002</LINK>). </P>
<P>Participants Lost to Follow-up: Details regarding participants lost to follow-up should be provided for both the intervention and control arms. We considered follow-up to be successful if 80% or more of both the intervention and the control groups were available at the end of the study. Following the Consort Statement (<LINK REF="REF-Moher-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 2001</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Altman-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Altman 2001</LINK>) (item 13a), attrition as a result of loss to follow up should be distinguished from exclusion, withdrawal from the study, and poor adherence to the protocol. </P>
<P>Length of Follow-up: We considered at least 6 months from study initiation to be an adequate length of follow-up because HAART regimens are life-long and adherence interventions need to show persistent effects to be beneficial. In addition, we considered (as a separate criterion) whether follow-up measurements were available for 80% or more of the participants in both the intervention and control groups at six months since study initiation. </P>
<P>Analysis of All Randomized Participants: This criterion refers to whether or not the investigators included in the analysis all the participants who underwent randomization and were analyzed in the groups to which they were randomized.</P>

<RESULTS>
<STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<P>We identified 7,512 citations from the searches conducted of the electronic databases from January 1996 to May 2005. Nineteen studies involving a total of 2,159 participants met criteria for inclusion (<LINK REF="STD-Berrien-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Berrien 2004</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-DiIorio-2003" TYPE="STUDY">DiIorio 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Fairley-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Fairley 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Goujard-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Goujard 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Jones-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Jones 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Knobel-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Knobel 1999</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Levy-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Levy 2004</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Murphy-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Murphy 2002</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Pradier-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Pradier 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Rathbun-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Rathbun 2005</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Rawlings-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Rawlings 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Safren-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Safren 2001</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Safren-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Safren 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Samet-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Samet 2005</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Smith-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Tuldra-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Tuldra 2000</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-van-Servellen-2003" TYPE="STUDY">van Servellen 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Weber-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Weber 2004</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Wyatt-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Wyatt 2004</LINK>). The most common reasons for exclusion were the absence of a comparison group and the failure to report a measure of adherence for both the intervention and control groups at 6 weeks from study initiation. Studies were heterogeneous with respect to populations, interventions, comparison groups, outcomes, and lengths of follow-up. Accordingly, we did not attempt to pool results using meta-analysis.</P>
<P>All studies were randomized controlled trials and were published in English with the exception of one paper that was published in Spanish (<LINK REF="STD-Knobel-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Knobel 1999</LINK>). Twelve studies were conducted in the US, two in Spain, two in France, two in Australia, and one in Switzerland. Sample sizes ranged from 22 to 367. Length of follow-up ranged from 6 weeks to 15 months. While some studies focused exclusively on children (<LINK REF="STD-Berrien-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Berrien 2004</LINK>), women (<LINK REF="STD-Jones-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Jones 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Wyatt-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Wyatt 2004</LINK>), Latinos (<LINK REF="STD-van-Servellen-2003" TYPE="STUDY">van Servellen 2003</LINK>), or adults with a history of alcohol dependence (<LINK REF="STD-Samet-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Samet 2005</LINK>), others included all patients with HIV, some of which had a large proportion of men in the study population (&gt;80%). Six studies specifically targeted patients who reported difficulties with adherence or who presented with poor adherence at study baseline (<LINK REF="STD-Safren-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Safren 2001</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Murphy-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Murphy 2002</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Jones-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Jones 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-van-Servellen-2003" TYPE="STUDY">van Servellen 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Safren-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Safren 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Weber-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Weber 2004</LINK>). The duration of the interventions ranged from a single session to multiple sessions delivered over one year. Five studies included participants who were either antiretroviral naïve or switching to a new antiretroviral regimen (<LINK REF="STD-Knobel-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Knobel 1999</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Tuldra-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Tuldra 2000</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Smith-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Rawlings-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Rawlings 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Rathbun-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Rathbun 2005</LINK>); the remainder included treatment-experienced participants who were taking antiretroviral medications at baseline.</P>
<P>The types of interventions varied from cognitive behavioral therapy, motivational interviewing, or medication management strategies, to interventions indirectly targeting adherence such as programs directed to reduce risky sexual behaviours. All interventions were directed at patients, individually or in groups, rather than at providers or health care systems. The interventions were delivered by lay individuals, health advocates, social workers, psychologists, nurses, pharmacists, and physicians. <BR/> <BR/>Adherence outcomes were calculated as dichotomous and/or continuous variables, ranging from the proportion of participants reaching a pre-determined threshold of adherence (e.g., ³95% adherence) to the mean difference in adherence levels from the end of the study to baseline. In general, the overall level of adherence at baseline in most studies ranged between 55% and 95%, which is consistent with reported estimates from other studies (<LINK REF="REF-Paterson-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Paterson 2000</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Bangsberg-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Bangsberg 2002</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Bangsberg-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bangsberg 2000</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Bangsberg-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bangsberg 2001</LINK>). Between 68% and 82% of study populations reported 95% or greater adherence at baseline, which is also consistent with the wide range seen in past studies (<LINK REF="REF-Paterson-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Paterson 2000</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Hugen-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hugen 2002</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Howard-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Howard 2002</LINK>). Virological or immunological outcomes were reported in 12 studies and ranged from the number of participants with a viral load above a pre-determined level to a mean difference in viral load from the end of the study to baseline. Some statistical analyses controlled for baseline values, others used the differences between follow-up and baseline values, and others used only follow-up and neglected baseline values.</P>
</STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<STUDY_QUALITY>
<P>The quality assessment showed that the examined studies had several methodological shortcomings (<LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>). In general, the quality of the studies was weak leaving most of the studies vulnerable to several potential biases. Because there were so few studies of good quality, we were unable to assess the effect of quality on study outcomes. </P>
<P>The randomization method was described and was considered appropriate in only 5 studies (<LINK REF="STD-Murphy-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Murphy 2002</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-van-Servellen-2003" TYPE="STUDY">van Servellen 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Weber-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Weber 2004</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Berrien-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Berrien 2004</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Rathbun-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Rathbun 2005</LINK>). All the included studies implemented the traditional two-group, parallel, randomized controlled trial design with the exception of three studies. Two studies from the same research group (<LINK REF="STD-Fairley-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Fairley 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Levy-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Levy 2004</LINK>) used an unconventional randomized design (a "Stepped-Wedge" design) while another study (<LINK REF="STD-Wyatt-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Wyatt 2004</LINK>) used a time-lagged wait-list control.</P>
<P>We identified four design features that may have resulted in an overestimation of the treatment effects: </P>
<P>(1) Allocation concealment: Only 3 studies described the method of allocation concealment (<LINK REF="STD-Weber-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Weber 2004</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Berrien-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Berrien 2004</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Rathbun-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Rathbun 2005</LINK>). It has been shown that studies that failed to report allocation concealment may overestimate the intervention effect by 41% and studies that incompletely report allocation concealment may overestimate the intervention effect by 30% (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>).</P>
<P>(2) Objective measure of adherence: Only 6 studies used an objective measure of adherence (<LINK REF="STD-Smith-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Rawlings-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Rawlings 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Safren-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Safren 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Weber-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Weber 2004</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Berrien-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Berrien 2004</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Rathbun-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Rathbun 2005</LINK>) (an additional study used an objective measure of adherence to corroborate the validity of the self-reports (<LINK REF="STD-Knobel-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Knobel 1999</LINK>)). A major limitation of using subjective reports is low sensitivity (i.e., many patients with low adherence would not be identified by self-report). In several studies where self-reported adherence methods were compared to Medication Event Monitoring System (MEMS) methods, self-reported methods have consistently overestimated adherence by 5-20% (<LINK REF="REF-Liu-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liu 2001</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Miller-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Miller 2000</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Gallant--1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gallant 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>(3) Analysis of all randomized participants: Only 3 studies analyzed all randomized participants (<LINK REF="STD-Tuldra-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Tuldra 2000</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Pradier-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Pradier 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Rathbun-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Rathbun 2005</LINK>). The conclusions derived from studies that fail to analyze all randomized participants can be misleading, particularly when there are imbalances between the intervention and control groups. Only two studies reported a method to handle missing data. One study imputed adherence rates by regression and the other study imputed missing data as last observation carried forward.</P>
<P>(4) Attention control: Only 3 studies reported that participants in both the intervention and control groups received a similar amount of contact time (<LINK REF="STD-Jones-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Jones 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Berrien-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Berrien 2004</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Wyatt-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Wyatt 2004</LINK>). This factor is particularly important when the intervention involves a considerable amount of contact time with the participants. If the contact time variable is not accounted for, the treatment effects may be the result of the non-specific effects of the increased attention paid to the intervention group as opposed to the intervention itself (<LINK REF="STD-McDonald-2002" TYPE="STUDY">McDonald 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>Regarding loss of participants to follow-up, less than half the studies (8 studies) reported following up successfully 80% or more of the participants in both the intervention and control groups at the end of the intervention (<LINK REF="STD-Knobel-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Knobel 1999</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Pradier-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Pradier 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Rawlings-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Rawlings 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-van-Servellen-2003" TYPE="STUDY">van Servellen 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Weber-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Weber 2004</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Berrien-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Berrien 2004</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Wyatt-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Wyatt 2004</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Samet-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Samet 2005</LINK>) (this was unclear for two additional studies (<LINK REF="STD-Safren-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Safren 2001</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Jones-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Jones 2003</LINK>)). A high level of attrition is a particular concern for adherence trials given the observation that adherence trials may already be intrinsically biased since they focus on participants who are already willing to take part on studies (<LINK REF="STD-McDonald-2002" TYPE="STUDY">McDonald 2002</LINK>). </P>
<P>In addition, regarding the length of the follow-up, just over half the studies (10 studies) reported follow-up times of 6 months or more since study initiation (<LINK REF="STD-Knobel-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Knobel 1999</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Tuldra-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Tuldra 2000</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Pradier-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Pradier 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Jones-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Jones 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Goujard-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Goujard 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Rawlings-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Rawlings 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Weber-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Weber 2004</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Berrien-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Berrien 2004</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Samet-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Samet 2005</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Rathbun-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Rathbun 2005</LINK>). This is particularly important for interventions designed to improve adherence to long-term treatments, such as HAART. Of these, however, only 3 studies reported 80% or more participants in both the intervention and control groups at six months (<LINK REF="STD-Knobel-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Knobel 1999</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Pradier-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Pradier 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Rawlings-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Rawlings 2003</LINK>).</P>
</STUDY_QUALITY>
<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
<P>Effects on Adherence Outcomes<BR/>Ten studies demonstrated a beneficial effect of the intervention on antiretroviral adherence (<LINK REF="STD-Knobel-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Knobel 1999</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Tuldra-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Tuldra 2000</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Pradier-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Pradier 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Smith-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Goujard-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Goujard 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Fairley-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Fairley 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Safren-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Safren 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Weber-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Weber 2004</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Berrien-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Berrien 2004</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Levy-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Levy 2004</LINK>), eight studies failed to demonstrate an improved level of adherence resulting from the intervention (<LINK REF="STD-Safren-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Safren 2001</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Murphy-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Murphy 2002</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-DiIorio-2003" TYPE="STUDY">DiIorio 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Rawlings-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Rawlings 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-van-Servellen-2003" TYPE="STUDY">van Servellen 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Wyatt-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Wyatt 2004</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Samet-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Samet 2005</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Rathbun-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Rathbun 2005</LINK>), and we were unable to determine a clear presence or absence of a benefit for one study because it failed to report a between-group comparison (<LINK REF="STD-Jones-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Jones 2003</LINK>). </P>
<P>We examined a number of intervention features to identify any recurring characteristics that may be linked to successful adherence outcomes. This semi-qualitative approach has been used by others to help identify the relationship between intervention characteristics and study outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-Kawamoto-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kawamoto 2005</LINK>). Features that tended to be associated with success included those interventions provided to individuals vs groups, those provided over longer periods of time (³ 12 weeks), and those interventions targeting practical medication management skills vs cognitive behavioral or motivational approaches. </P>
<P>When interventions were provided at the individual level, 67% (10/15) were successful (<LINK REF="STD-Knobel-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Knobel 1999</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Tuldra-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Tuldra 2000</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Pradier-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Pradier 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Smith-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Goujard-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Goujard 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Fairley-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Fairley 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Safren-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Safren 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Weber-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Weber 2004</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Berrien-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Berrien 2004</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Levy-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Levy 2004</LINK>) compared to a 0% (0/4) success rate observed with interventions provided in a group setting. In addition, 86% (6/7) of the interventions provided over 12 weeks or more successfully improved adherence (<LINK REF="STD-Knobel-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Knobel 1999</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Pradier-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Pradier 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Smith-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Goujard-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Goujard 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Safren-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Safren 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Berrien-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Berrien 2004</LINK>) compared to those interventions delivered under 12 weeks (0/8 or 0% success rate).<BR/> <BR/>Interventions that targeted the improvement of patient's medication management skills were fairly successful (6/8 or 75% success rate) (<LINK REF="STD-Tuldra-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Tuldra 2000</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Smith-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Goujard-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Goujard 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Fairley-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Fairley 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Safren-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Safren 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Levy-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Levy 2004</LINK>) when compared to interventions designed around cognitive behavioral therapy and motivational interviewing approaches (1/7 or 14% success rate) (<LINK REF="STD-Weber-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Weber 2004</LINK>). The interventions that focused on medication management skills consistently used reminders or memory aids, such as beepers, alarms, medication boxes, planning cards, paging systems, text messaging, or visual aids (i.e., a study had to provide these reminders exclusively to the intervention group for that study to be labeled as having this feature; we excluded from this category those studies that also provided these reminders to the control group). In general, these interventions were designed to improve the levels of adherence by improving the participant's medication management skills (e.g., medication information, tailored drug schedules, medication dossettes, side-effect management, and reminder devices) and by helping patients identify and address barriers to adherence (e.g., problems patients might face in real-life situations or strategies to manage side-effects). </P>
<P>Several of the studies that looked at marginalized populations such as women (<LINK REF="STD-Wyatt-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Wyatt 2004</LINK>), Latinos (<LINK REF="STD-van-Servellen-2003" TYPE="STUDY">van Servellen 2003</LINK>), or patients with a past history of alcoholism (<LINK REF="STD-Samet-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Samet 2005</LINK>) were not successful at improving adherence. This may suggest that a different approach needs to be developed in order to design effective interventions for these populations.</P>
<P>The presence of inconsistent outcomes or intervention features that appeared in only a small number of studies limited our ability to reach conclusions about the relationship between other types of interventions and outcomes. We were unable to ascertain whether success was associated with the type of provider administering the intervention, the number of visits over which the intervention was provided, the antiretroviral experiences of patients, delivery at tertiary or academic centers, or the targeting of patients reporting poor adherence at baseline. </P>
<P>We were unable to determine the effect of the type of provider because many interventions were delivered by different combinations of providers (e.g., pharmacists/ nurses, physicians/nurses) and it was not feasible to disentangle the effects of a single provider or a particular combination of providers. The effect of providing the intervention over multiple visits was also difficult to interpret as six out of twelve interventions (50%) that included 3 visits or more were successful, but 3 out of 4 (75%) that included less than 3 visits were also successful. Whether the intervention was provided to patients already on established regimens or those initiating/switching to a new regimen affected the success of the interventions was also difficult to interpret. Three of the five studies (60%) that offered the intervention to patients initiating or switching to new antiretroviral regimens were positive studies, compared to 7 of 14 studies targeting patients who were already on existing regimens (50% success rate). Even though the interventions that were implemented in tertiary or academic centers had a 62% success rate (8/13), those interventions that were delivered in non-tertiary centers had a 33% success rate (1/3). Lastly, two out of six interventions (33%) that targeted patients presenting with poor adherence or who reported difficulties with adherence at baseline were successful while 8 out of 13 studies (62%) that did not mention whether or not they targeted patients reporting poor adherence were also successful. </P>
<P>Effects on Virological and/or Immunological Outcomes<BR/>We were unable to determine whether improved adherence extended to improved viral or immunologic outcomes. Six studies included virological outcomes only (<LINK REF="STD-Tuldra-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Tuldra 2000</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Pradier-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Pradier 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Smith-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Weber-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Weber 2004</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Berrien-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Berrien 2004</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Rathbun-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Rathbun 2005</LINK>) and six studies included both virological and immunological outcomes (<LINK REF="STD-Knobel-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Knobel 1999</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Goujard-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Goujard 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Rawlings-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Rawlings 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Fairley-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Fairley 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Levy-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Levy 2004</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Samet-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Samet 2005</LINK>). Only 5 out of 12 studies that reported virological and/or immunological results found at least one significant effect associated with the intervention (<LINK REF="STD-Knobel-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Knobel 1999</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Tuldra-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Tuldra 2000</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Pradier-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Pradier 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Samet-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Samet 2005</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Rathbun-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Rathbun 2005</LINK>). These studies reported conflicting statistical findings. For example, three studies reported a statistical significant result for one outcome (e.g., reduction in viral load) but not another (e.g., proportion of patients with a viral load below a pre-determined level) (<LINK REF="STD-Knobel-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Knobel 1999</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Pradier-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Pradier 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Samet-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Samet 2005</LINK>). Another study reported a significant finding when the analysis included only those participants who completed the study but not when the analysis included all those participants that were randomized at study entry (<LINK REF="STD-Tuldra-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Tuldra 2000</LINK>). Another study reported statistically significant findings for some points in time (e.g., week 4 and 28), but not for others (e.g, week 16) (<LINK REF="STD-Rathbun-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Rathbun 2005</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>We found evidence to support the effectiveness of some types of patient support and education interventions in improving adherence to antiretroviral therapy. Overall, several key intervention features such as interventions delivered to individuals vs groups, those delivered over 12 weeks or more, and those interventions targeting practical medication management skills vs cognitive behavioural or motivational approaches, were present in many of the successful intervention studies. To our knowledge, our systematic review is the first to suggest that interventions directly targeting practical medication management skills tended to be effective at improving adherence, and that interventions targeting psychological constructs (e.g., self-efficacy, attitudes, motivation, emotions, stress management, cognitive distortions and automatic thoughts) may be ineffective or may take longer to have an impact. </P>
<P>We also found that interventions targeting marginalized groups such as women, Latinos, or patients with a past history of alcohol dependence were not associated with improved adherence.</P>
<P>We were unable to determine whether the advantage associated with adherence outcomes translated to improved virological or immunological outcomes. This finding may be attributable to participant selection, since laboratory responses may be more difficult to demonstrate in patients using antiretroviral drugs at study baseline, or due to time factors, since virological and immunological responses may lag behind improved adherence. Alternatively, our results may indicate that average incremental improvements in adherence are nevertheless too small to improve clinical outcomes. Studies of adequate power and duration are required to resolve this question.</P>
<P>Our findings are in contrast to a recent systematic review (<LINK REF="REF-Amico-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Amico 2006</LINK>), which found that patients reporting low levels of adherence at baseline benefited the most from adherence interventions. This difference may be the result of differing inclusion criteria. For example, while we included only randomized controlled trials, Amico et al included both between- and within-group designs (<LINK REF="REF-Amico-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Amico 2006</LINK>). Furthermore, we included 9 more randomized controlled trials because our search window extended until May 2005 and we included all eligible studies, even if we could not calculate effect sizes. </P>
<P>Inconsistencies and small number of studies limited our ability to reach conclusions about the effectiveness of the type of providers, the type of settings (e.g., tertiary vs community settings), the status of antiretroviral regimen at the time of consultation (whether patients are initiating a new regimen, switching to a new regimen, or already on an existing regimen), or the "dose" or intensity of the interventions.</P>
<P>There were several limitations to our systematic review. We were unable to pool the data for meta-analysis because of significant heterogeneity in many study features. As well, we were unable to assess the clinical significance of the reported adherence outcomes. Such concerns may be particularly important for future studies as the understanding of optimal adherence evolves. In addition, some studies included unvalidated adherence measures (e.g., an ordinal score ranging from one to four (<LINK REF="STD-Goujard-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Goujard 2003</LINK>) or the proportion of patients reporting being adherent on 14 consecutive days (<LINK REF="STD-Wyatt-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Wyatt 2004</LINK>)). </P>
<P>Lastly, some of the included studies were conceived as pilot studies, a development that is consistent with the increasing level of maturity of any new technology. These studies, either by definition or as a result of feasibility issues, may have lacked the power to detect meaningful differences between the intervention and control groups. McDonald et al suggested as a rule of thumb that adherence studies require the inclusion of at least 60 participants per group in order to have 80% power to detect an absolute difference of 25% in the proportion of participants judged to have adequate adherence (<LINK REF="STD-McDonald-2002" TYPE="STUDY">McDonald 2002</LINK>). Only 7 studies met this rule of thumb (<LINK REF="STD-Knobel-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Knobel 1999</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Pradier-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Pradier 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Jones-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Jones 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Goujard-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Goujard 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Rawlings-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Rawlings 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Wyatt-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Wyatt 2004</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Samet-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Samet 2005</LINK>). Of these, three reported a statistical advantage favouring the intervention (<LINK REF="STD-Knobel-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Knobel 1999</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Pradier-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Pradier 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Goujard-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Goujard 2003</LINK>) and an additional one reported an improvement in mean CD4 cell counts (<LINK REF="STD-Samet-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Samet 2005</LINK>) (this study did not report significant findings for the adherence outcome).</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>This systematic review found evidence to support the effectiveness of some patient support and education interventions to improve adherence to antiretroviral therapy. We found that those interventions targeting practical medication management skills, those administered to individuals vs groups, and those delivered over 12 weeks or more could improve adherence to antiretroviral therapy. We did not find evidence to suggest that interventions targeting more complex psychological constructs were effective at improving adherence outcomes. We also failed to find evidence that interventions targeting marginalized populations such as women, Latinos, or patients with a past history of alcoholism were successful at improving adherence. Further studies should focus on medication management skills interventions to confirm the effectiveness of these approaches and the generalizability of these results to a wider range of populations. </P>
<P>We did not find any studies that examined the effectiveness of provider-level interventions (e.g., those interventions that provide feedback to practitioners) and system-level interventions (e.g., those interventions that address access and affordability to services). Future efforts may need to look at the effectiveness of these interventions as evidence suggests that the quality of the patient-provider relationship and clinical setting are also important influences on adherence (<LINK REF="STD-Ickovics-2002a" TYPE="STUDY">Ickovics 2002a</LINK>).</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>There is a need for standardization and improved methodological rigour in the conduct of adherence trials. Adherence studies should follow a randomized design that implements and reports appropriate randomization and allocation concealment methods, uses an objective measure of adherence, follows up participants over at least 6 months since study initiation, and analyzes patients to the groups to which they were randomized. </P>
<P>The statistical analyses should also control for baseline values or use the differences between follow-up and baseline values as the main outcome to make sure that the intervention and control groups are equivalent at study entry. In addition, adherence trials need to be powered to detect clinically significant differences using appropriate adherence outcomes that are clearly specified a priori.</P>
