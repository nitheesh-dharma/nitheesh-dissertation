<P>The conclusions regarding the use of oral steroid at short-term follow up remain the same, but the evidence for the effectiveness of oral steroid plus antibiotic therapy is stronger than that of the use of oral steroid alone. There is also imperfect evidence suggesting that the use of oral steroid plus antibiotic may be effective at intermediate follow up. We no longer conclude that there is evidence of short-term improvement with topical intranasal steroid with or without antibiotics. The conclusions regarding long-term outcomes remain the same.</P>
<P>We have adopted the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool for assessment of study quality (which involved reassessing the studies included in the previous version of the review). We have also incorporated 'Summary of findings' tables, used the I statistic to assess heterogeneity and changed the analysis method for dichotomous outcomes from odds ratio (OR) using a fixed-effect method to risk ratio (RR) using a random-effects method.</P>

<TITLE>Oral or topical nasal steroids for hearing loss associated with otitis media with effusion (glue ear) in children</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2011-03-29 12:05:25 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Glue ear (otitis media with effusion - OME) is sticky fluid in the middle ear that does not cause pain or fever but can reduce hearing. Steroid drugs (taken orally or as nose spray) are sometimes used to try to speed up the resolution of effusion and so prevent hearing loss. Other treatment options include oral antibiotics and other medicines, or surgical procedures such as grommets (ventilation tubes). This review of trials found that oral steroids (especially when used in combination with antibiotics) speeded up the resolution of OME in the short term. However, there was no long-term evidence to show lasting benefit or improved hearing. There was no evidence that using steroid drugs as a nose spray benefited children with OME.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2011-03-28 11:08:44 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included 12 medium to high-quality studies with a total of 945 participants. No study documented hearing loss associated with OME prior to randomisation. The follow-up period was generally limited, with only one study of intranasal steroid reporting outcome data beyond six months. There was no evidence of benefit from steroid treatment (oral or topical) in terms of hearing loss associated with OME. Pooled data using a fixed-effect model for OME resolution at short-term follow up (&lt; 1 month) showed a significant effect of oral steroids compared to control (RR 4.48; 95% CI 1.52 to 13.23; Chi 2.75, df = 2, P = 0.25; I = 27%). Oral steroids plus antibiotic also resulted in an improvement in OME resolution compared to placebo plus antibiotic at less than one month follow up, using a random-effects model (RR 1.99; 95% CI 1.14 to 3.49; five trials, 409 children). However, there was significant heterogeneity between studies (P &lt; 0.01, I = 69%). There was no evidence of beneficial effect on OME resolution at greater than one month follow up with oral steroids (used alone or with antibiotics) or intranasal steroids (used alone or with antibiotics) at any follow-up period. There was also no evidence of benefit from steroid treatment (oral or topical) in terms of symptoms.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2011-03-28 13:25:13 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This is one of a number of reviews of treatment options for patients with OME prepared within the Cochrane Ear, Nose and Throat Disorders Group.</P>
<P>Otitis media with effusion (OME), or 'glue ear', is characterised by an accumulation of fluid in the middle ear, in the absence of acute inflammation. It is an important and common problem. OME is the commonest cause of acquired hearing loss in childhood and may negatively effect language development (<LINK REF="REF-Haggard-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haggard 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lous-1995a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lous 1995a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lous-1995b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lous 1995b</LINK>). OME is also associated with anxiety/depression and attention disorders and so may affect both children, their families and peers (<LINK REF="REF-Gouma-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gouma 2010</LINK>). OME in early childhood has been shown to affect IQ, behaviour and reading into late teens (<LINK REF="REF-Bennett-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bennett 2001</LINK>). The reason why the condition develops is uncertain, but low-grade infection, poor Eustachian tube function, allergy and adenoidal infection or hypertrophy have all been implicated (<LINK REF="REF-Chantzi-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chantzi 2005</LINK>). OME often resolves spontaneously and return to normal middle ear function often occurs within three months (<LINK REF="REF-MRC-Multi_x002d_Centre-Otitis-Media-Study-Group-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">MRC Multi-Centre Otitis Media Study Group 2001</LINK>).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Prevalence</HEADING>
<P>OME has a prevalence of about 20% at around two years of age with another peak at six years (<LINK REF="REF-Zielhuis-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zielhuis 1990</LINK>). The prevalence of recurrent otitis media may be increasing (<LINK REF="REF-Lanphear-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lanphear 1997</LINK>) and visits to the doctor for otitis media and otitis media with effusion have risen (from 9.9 million in 1975 to 24.5 million in 1990 in the US) (<LINK REF="REF-Schappert-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schappert 1992</LINK>). Overall, the prognosis for OME is good, with over 50% of OME episodes resolving spontaneously within three months and 95% within one year. However, 30% to 40% of children have recurrent OME episodes and 5% of preschool children aged five years have persistent (longer than three months) bilateral hearing loss associated with OME (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2008</LINK>).잸lthough the diagnosis of OME in primary care has increased over the last decade, the number of grommet operations performed in England and Wales fell from 43,300 in 1994-1995 to 25,442 in 2009-2010, primarily as a result of the &#8216;watchful waiting&#8217; strategy (<LINK REF="REF-HES-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">HES 2010</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Cost</HEADING>
<P>The total annual cost of treating children under five for OME is over GBP 5000 million (EUR 4800) annually in the US (<LINK REF="REF-Gates-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gates 1996</LINK>). The insertion of grommets (ventilation or tympanostomy tubes) is the second commonest surgical procedure in children, costing USD 1200 million (EUR 1100) annually in the US (<LINK REF="REF-Gates-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gates 1996</LINK>). The full cost of ventilation tube insertion is estimated to be GBP 1208 in the UK and hearing aid treatment for OME is estimated to cost GBP 752 (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2008</LINK>). OME is a common reason for prescribing antibiotics that contributes to the growing problem of bacterial resistance.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Diagnosis</HEADING>
<P>The recommended technique for diagnosing otitis media with effusion is impedance audiometry (tympanometry) in combination with otomicroscopy or pneumatic otoscopy (<LINK REF="REF-Bluestone-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bluestone 1988</LINK>). OME is deemed to be present when the tympanometry results in a flat curve (relative gradient less than 0.1, type B), when mobility of the tympanic membrane is absent or reduced, or fluid or air bubbles are evident behind the ear drum. However, not all children with effusions suffer significant hearing loss. The positive predictive value for hearing loss of 25 dB or more of tympanometry characteristic of OME ranges from 49.0% to 66.4% (<LINK REF="REF-Dempster-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dempster 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kazanas-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kazanas 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-MRC-Multi_x002d_Centre-Otitis-Media-Study-Group-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">MRC Multi-Centre Otitis Media Study Group 1999</LINK>). Tympanometry is therefore a surrogate measure for hearing loss associated with OME, and intervention decisions should ideally be made when hearing loss is documented (<LINK REF="REF-MRC-Multi_x002d_Centre-Otitis-Media-Study-Group-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">MRC Multi-Centre Otitis Media Study Group 1999</LINK>).<BR/>

<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2010-11-23 10:38:36 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Many patients with OME require no specific treatment. The most common medical treatment options include the use of decongestants, mucolytics, steroids, antihistamines, antibiotics and auto-inflation. Surgical treatment options include grommet insertion, myringotomy (tympanocentesis, i.e. surgical incision of the ear drum, with or without aspiration of fluid from the middle ear cavity) and adenoidectomy. The optimal treatment strategy remains controversial, there being wide international variability in clinical practice. The UK National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) recommends active observation for three months before intervention is considered (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2008</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2011-03-28 11:21:51 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is in vitro and animal model evidence that steroids modulate effusions (<LINK REF="REF-Baggett-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baggett 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tan-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tan 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Haddard-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haddard 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Yaman-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yaman 2008</LINK>). It is hypothesised that steroids could clear effusions by: (a) stabilising membrane phospholipid breakdown and thus preventing the formation of arachidonic acid and associated inflammatory mediators; (b) shrinking peri-tubal lymphoid tissue; (c) enhancing secretion of Eustachian tube surfactant; and (d) reducing middle ear fluid viscosity (<LINK REF="REF-Rosenfeld-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rosenfeld 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ducharme-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ducharme 2003</LINK>).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Topical intranasal steroids</HEADING>
<P>Topical intranasal steroids may be safer than systemic preparations because the glucocorticoid is rapidly degraded in the nasal mucosa to less active metabolites and any unchanged drug that is absorbed is metabolised in the first pass through the liver (<LINK REF="STD-Tracy-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Tracy 1998</LINK>). Systemic adverse effects are therefore less likely, while the desired anti-inflammatory effects may be similar.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Oral steroids</HEADING>
<P>Systemic steroids, however, may be able to gain access to the middle ear, while topical intranasal steroids would not be expected to reach the middle ear but may modulate Eustachian tube function. Clinicians may be concerned about using systemic steroids for what may be a self-limiting condition. However, short courses of oral corticosteroids are widely used to treat acute asthma in children and are usually well-tolerated. Side effects such as dyspepsia and behavioural disturbances are infrequent and resolve on drug withdrawal. There have been case reports of disseminated varicella infection in a child receiving short-term steroids for asthma (<LINK REF="REF-Wu-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wu 2008</LINK>). Although long-term or frequent courses of oral steroids are associated with important adverse effects, repeated short courses of prednisolone (median of four courses in a year) in children with asthma were shown to be safe and not associated with any lasting effects on bone metabolism or mineralisation or adrenal function (<LINK REF="REF-Ducharme-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ducharme 2003</LINK>). The National Institutes of Health (NIH) in the US advises that children who have not had chickenpox and periodically take oral corticosteroids should receive the varicella vaccine after they have been steroid-free for at least one month (<LINK REF="REF-NIH-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">NIH 2007</LINK>).</P>

</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2011-03-29 13:55:45 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Antibiotics, topical or systemic antihistamines, topical or systemic decongestants,쟴opical or systemic corticosteroids, homeopathy, cranial osteopathy, acupuncture, dietary modification (including probiotics) and immunostimulants are not recommend for treating OME (<LINK REF="REF-Griffin-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Griffin 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NICE-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2008</LINK>). Standard treatments for OME, such as hearing aids and ventilation tube insertion, are not trouble-free. Ventilation tube insertion involves a general anaesthetic. It is associated with an improvement in the mean hearing levels of 4 to 10 dB in children with bilateral tubes during the first six months of follow up but this diminishes with time (<LINK REF="REF-Browning-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Browning 2010</LINK>). Hearing aids can be uncomfortable and be associated with bullying and perceived stigma (<LINK REF="REF-Dengerink-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dengerink 1984</LINK>). An alternative treatment, cheap and effective within primary care, would reduce secondary care referral and represent and important opportunity for cost saving to the health service쟞nd parents.</P>
<P>The effect of systemic and topical intranasal steroids on otitis media with effusion in children has been the subject of randomised and controlled clinical trials. At least three meta-analyses have addressed the topic and have found evidence for a 'steroid effect' (<LINK REF="REF-Nuss-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nuss 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rosenfeld-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rosenfeld 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stool-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stool 1994</LINK>). All concluded that steroids cleared effusions more quickly in the short term. However, trials were often small and results of individual trials were contradictory. Nuss et al included trials published in abstract form only, whose quality could not be adequately assessed. One trial (<LINK REF="STD-Podoshin-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Podoshin 1990</LINK>) was not published when Rosenfeld and colleagues conducted their meta-analysis. Stool et al pooled a study of topical steroids with studies of systemic steroids. Since these three meta-analyses, two randomised controlled trials have examined the effect of topical intranasal steroids in OME (<LINK REF="STD-Tracy-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Tracy 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Williamson-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Williamson 2009</LINK>) and at least three other relevant trials involving oral steroids have been published (<LINK REF="STD-Rosenfeld-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Rosenfeld 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hemlin-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Hemlin 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mandel-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Mandel 2002</LINK>). Existing systematic reviews have not examined topical steroid treatment separately. This systematic review updates existing studies and includes separate consideration of topical intranasal steroids.</P>

<OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2010-10-22 14:21:55 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>To determine the beneficial and harmful effects of treatment with steroids (both oral and topical intranasal) for children with hearing loss associated with otitis media with effusion. Our a priori hypothesis was that steroid treatment (oral or topical intranasal), either alone or in combination with another agent, is effective in treating the hearing loss associated with OME and in resolving effusions in children.</P>
<P>The primary outcomes sought were changes in hearing. Secondary outcomes were effect on effusions and adverse effects of treatment. As a minimum requirement, we expected studies to report short-term effects on effusions identified by a combination of pneumo-otoscopy or otomicroscopy and tympanometry.</P>

<P>Randomised controlled trials of oral and topical intranasal steroids. We included randomised studies that used non-intervention controls where blinding of outcome assessment was adequate. We excluded publications that were only available in abstract form since adequate appraisal was not possible; uncontrolled, non-randomised or retrospective studies; and studies reporting outcomes only with ears as the unit of analysis (rather than children) since observations made on the ears of a single child cannot be regarded as independent. In addition, we considered that if a 'single-ear view' of the whole child could not be extracted from the information provided, studies might be poor in other ways. Williams has shown that studies reporting outcomes by ear have larger effect sizes than studies using the child as the unit of analysis (<LINK REF="REF-Williams-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Williams 1993</LINK>). We made attempts to contact the authors of studies published only in abstract form for a full study report, and included these where obtained. We excluded studies (or data from arms of studies) comparing treatment with steroid plus additional treatment to treatment with placebo plus placebo because it was not possible to identify the 'steroid effect' from such data.</P>

<P>We used the statistical methods for dichotomous outcomes described by Yusuf et al (<LINK REF="REF-Yusuf-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yusuf 1985</LINK>). Results were expressed as a risk ratio (RR) for achieving the outcome in question at a given point in time together with the 95% confidence interval (CI) for this estimate. We decided to use RRs rather than odds ratios (ORs) as they are easier to interpret and consistent with general intuition (<LINK REF="REF-Davies-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davies 1998</LINK>). We presented continuous data using the weighted mean difference (and 95% CI). We pooled studies using a random-effects method. We were interested in the broad perspective of whether steroid treatment (systemic or intranasal and with or without antibiotics) is beneficial for treating OME in children. We were therefore interested in the average effect of the intervention across clinically diverse studies, which represented the different mix of participants and implementations of the interventions that we wanted our results to be generalisable to. We assessed statistical heterogeneity between studies using the Chi test, the I statistic and visual inspection of the forest plots. When this was present we tried to investigate the reasons for the heterogeneity (including methodological factors or outcome assessment), but the small number of included studies precluded the use meta-regression or subgroup analyses. When considerable heterogeneity (i.e. I ranged from 75% to 100%) (<LINK REF="REF-Deeks-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deeks 2008</LINK>) was present and there was inconsistency in the direction of the results then pooling was not considered appropriate (the P value of the Chi test and width of the CIs were also taken into consideration when making this interpretation).</P>

Two further studies (<LINK REF="STD-Schwartz-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Schwartz 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lambert-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Lambert 1986</LINK>) reported the number of participants included in the analyses, but it was unclear if this was the same as the number of participants initially randomised.</P>

<P>In the study by Podoshin (oral steroid plus antibiotic versus placebo plus antibiotic) the reporting of outcomes were confusing: 'success' is defined as normal otoscopy, tympanometry and closure of the air-bone gap, yet outcomes for 'complete improvement' are given according to audiometry and tympanometry separately (<LINK REF="STD-Podoshin-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Podoshin 1990</LINK>).</P>
<P>Giebink and colleagues used an open design because treatment regimens differed and placebo control was not feasible (<LINK REF="STD-Giebink-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Giebink 1990</LINK>).

There was no clear reason as to why this study would report inconsistent findings, although the study was poorly reported and included slightly older children, ranging from two to 15 years (mean six years).

<HEADING LEVEL="3">General</HEADING>
<P>Our objectives were to assess whether the average effect of steroids for OME is beneficial, which is a much broader perspective than that of individual studies that assess the use of a specific steroid intervention in a narrow patient population. We also wanted to able to generalise the findings to a range of scenarios. As such our review included a clinically diverse set of studies that differed in terms of pharmacological interventions including the steroid formulation, steroid dose, duration of steroid treatment and concomitant antibiotic; and study population including age, setting, proportion with bilateral OME and duration of OME at study entry. However, we deemed the studies to have enough in common for it to make sense to synthesise the data, and statistical heterogeneity was not considerable.</P>
<P>Ten comparisons across the study groups included only one study, so they offer no new information. Overall, seven comparisons favoured steroids, six favoured controls and two favoured neither. However, the confidence intervals were generally wide and included unity for all but one comparison. There were a small number of studies in many of the comparisons, therefore risk of bias was not used in sensitivity analyses.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Oral steroids</HEADING>
<P>There was no evidence of the beneficial effect of oral steroids (with or without antibiotics) on hearing loss associated with otitis media with effusion (OME). However, this outcome was only evaluated by two studies of small (oral steroids) to moderate size (oral steroids plus antibiotics). One study also included patients with unilateral hearing loss and the other did not state how many had bilateral or unilateral hearing loss. Only one study required documented hearing loss for all children prior to study entry.</P>
<P>Children treated with a steroid used together with an antibiotic were twice as likely to have improved resolution of their effusion as those treated with antibiotics plus placebo in the short term (up to two weeks post-randomisation: risk ratio (RR) 1.99; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.14 to 3.49). However, the beneficial effect of steroids was no longer statistically significant (RR 1.44; 95% CI 0.97 to 2.13) at intermediate follow up (up to two months after randomisation), although the meta-analysis only included two studies (231 children).</P>
<P>Oral steroids, when used alone, also appear to have a beneficial effect on the resolution of OME in the short term. Using a random-effects model, children who were treated with oral steroids were over three times more likely to have an improved resolution of effusion than those treated with placebo, but the confidence interval was wide and included unity (RR 3.80; 95% CI 0.93 to 15.52). However, when a fixed-effect model was used to pool the same data the findings became statistically significant. Although the clinical heterogeneity between studies means that a random-effects model was appropriate, there was no statistical heterogeneity present and the findings of the fixed-effect model demonstrates the potential effectiveness of oral steroids for OME resolution in the short term. However, the beneficial effect of oral steroids, as with the steroids plus antibiotics, was no longer statistically significant (RR 1.54; 95% CI 0.76 to 3.14) at intermediate follow up (up to six weeks after randomisation) but the meta-analysis was based on fewer than 100 children (three studies).</P>
<P>Few data were available for longer-term outcomes. One study (<LINK REF="STD-Hemlin-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Hemlin 1997</LINK>) reported six-month data on OME resolution, but only provided these data for a subset of 15 (13%) patients who were considered cured at prior follow-up visits. No study assessed the effect of steroids on hearing or speech in the longer term.</P>
<P>Data concerning adverse effects were provided in five studies. No lasting or serious adverse effects were reported. However, the numbers of children involved are insufficient to judge safety in pragmatic settings and no long-term data were available. Furthermore, we only included randomised controlled trials in our review, which is not the optimum study design for evaluating adverse effects, especially if they are uncommon or long-term.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Topical nasal steroids</HEADING>
<P>Given concern about treating what is often a self-limiting condition with systemic steroids, we were particularly interested to examine evidence for the effectiveness of topical intranasal steroids. The two studies we included of topical intranasal steroid and the one study of topical intranasal steroids in combination with an antibiotic showed no benefit in the short, intermediate or long term.</P>
<P>Only one study (<LINK REF="STD-Williamson-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Williamson 2009</LINK>), which compared topical intranasal steroid with placebo, reported on hearing loss, for which there was no benefit. The same study also reported long-term data on speech and language, which was part of a subscale of the condition-specific outcome scale OM8-30. However, the findings were reported in a format we could not use for this review and so could not be included in our analyses.</P>
<P>All three studies mentioned adverse effects. No lasting or serious adverse effects were found.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">General</HEADING>
<P>No study documented hearing loss prospectively prior to study entry. Seven studies included audiometry data in their outcomes, but hearing loss results of only three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Macknin-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Macknin 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Podoshin-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Podoshin 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Williamson-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Williamson 2009</LINK>) could be used in this review. Steroid treatment did not improve hearing loss. Only two studies attempted to measure the effect of steroids on subjective symptoms.</P>
<P>Comparing our results to previous reviews, Nuss and Berman (<LINK REF="REF-Nuss-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nuss 1990</LINK>) included studies published in abstract form only (<LINK REF="STD-Heary-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Heary 1990</LINK>) and a non-randomised, open study (<LINK REF="STD-Persico-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Persico 1978</LINK>). They concluded that combination therapy (oral steroids plus antibiotics) is worth considering in children with OME persisting beyond eight weeks prior to surgical intervention. Rosenfeld and colleagues (<LINK REF="REF-Rosenfeld-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rosenfeld 1991</LINK>) performed a meta-analysis of six randomised trials, and concluded that children receiving oral steroids for seven to 14 days were three times more likely than control subjects to have both ears free of effusion at the end of therapy (95% CI 2.2 to 4.1). They also found significant heterogeneity between studies. Three of the studies involved treatment with oral steroid plus antibiotic (odds ratio (OR) favouring steroid plus antibiotic treatment 2.8; 95% CI 2.0 to 4.0) and three oral steroid alone (OR favouring steroids 3.7; 95% CI 2.0 to 6.7). These authors concluded that despite favourable ORs for short-term resolution of effusions, they could not recommend the use of steroids for OME until more is known about which children are most likely to derive benefit. The difference between these reviews and the results we obtained are accounted for by the inclusion of a study published after their analysis was done (<LINK REF="STD-Hemlin-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Hemlin 1997</LINK>). We considered clinical effectiveness. Berman and colleagues performed a meta-analysis of clinical effectiveness to establish cost-effectiveness of treatment for OME (<LINK REF="REF-Berman-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Berman 1994</LINK>). In comparing steroid plus antibiotic, they included two trials that did not meet our inclusion criteria (<LINK REF="STD-Berman-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Berman 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Daly-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Daly 1991</LINK>). They concluded that steroid plus antibiotic was the most cost-effective intervention to clear bilateral middle ear effusion for children at a first follow-up visit six weeks after diagnosis of acute otitis media. However, they did not consider risks, adverse effects and parental preferences. The meta-analysis for the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research (AHCPR) used Bayesian statistical methods (<LINK REF="REF-Stool-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stool 1994</LINK>). Based on the same studies we included for oral steroids compared to control, they found a mean difference in OME at two weeks of 18.4% (95% CI -3.4% to 38.6%) favouring steroid therapy. By four to six weeks the difference in improvement was 4.5% (95% CI -11.7% to 20.6%). Comparing oral steroid plus antibiotic to antibiotic, they included the trial by Podoshin (<LINK REF="STD-Podoshin-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Podoshin 1990</LINK>) but the trial by Hemlin (<LINK REF="STD-Hemlin-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Hemlin 1997</LINK>) was not yet published. They found a mean improvement for antibiotic steroid combination compared to antibiotic alone of 25.1% (95% CI -1.3% to 49%) that was not statistically significant. They also did a comparison of steroids plus antibiotic compared to control and included a trial of topical nasal steroids in this comparison; they found a mean improvement of OME due to steroid plus antibiotic therapy of 21.4% (95% CI -1.4% to 42.6%) that was not statistically significant. We did not carry out this comparison since treatment arms differed more than by steroid alone. The AHCPR recommended that steroids should not be used for OME. The UK National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) recommends against intranasal steroid treatment for OME (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2008</LINK>).</P>

<P>There is no evidence of beneficial effect from steroids (oral or topical) on hearing loss associated with OME. There is some evidence demonstrating short-term improvement of OME from oral steroids, especially when used in combination with antibiotics. However, we found no evidence for lasting beneficial effect on effusions from oral or topical intranasal steroid treatment, and no short-term benefit from intranasal steroids.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2010-11-23 12:51:11 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>OME may be present without significant hearing loss and there is a high rate of spontaneous recovery from the hearing loss associated with OME, so future studies should document hearing loss associated with OME for a period prior to beginning study treatment and at follow up. In the absence of evidence that unilateral OME influences language development, the practice of either treating in routine clinical practice or entering children with unilateral OME into treatment research studies is questionable. Follow up should be longer and ideally include symptom, or quality of life, and hearing assessments. Audiometry data should be presented not as mean hearing levels for groups but as numbers of children with defined levels of hearing loss in their best hearing ear. Data should not be presented with ears as the unit of analysis since observations on the different ears of the same child cannot be regarded as independent. Assessors of outcomes should be blinded to the treatment allocation. Improvement should be clearly defined, for example authors should present data for children with bilateral OME resolving in one but not both ears. Analysis should be on the basis of intention-to-treat. A short course of oral steroids followed by longer-term topical intranasal steroids has so far not been evaluated.</P>
