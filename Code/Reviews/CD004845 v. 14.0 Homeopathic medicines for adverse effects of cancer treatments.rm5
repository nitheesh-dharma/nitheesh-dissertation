<P>Homeopathic medicines are used by many patients with cancer, usually alongside conventional treatment. Cancer treatments can cause adverse effects, and one of the reasons patients use homeopathic medicines is to help with these symptoms. This review looked at whether these medicines could help patients with problems caused by cancer treatments. Eight studies with a total of 664 participants were included in this review. Three studied adverse effects of radiotherapy, three studied adverse effects of chemotherapy and two studied menopausal symptoms associated with breast cancer treatment. Two studies with low risk of bias demonstrated benefit: one with 254 participants demonstrated benefits from calendula ointment in the prevention of radiotherapy-induced dermatitis, and another with 32 participants demonstrated benefits from Traumeel S (a complex homeopathic medicine) over placebo as a mouthwash for chemotherapy-induced stomatitis. These trials need replicating. Two other studies reported positive results, although the risk of bias was unclear, and four further studies reported negative results. The homeopathic medicines used in all eight studies did not seem to cause any serious adverse effects or interact with conventional treatment. No cancer treatments were modified or stopped because of the homeopathic interventions.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2012-03-15 17:11:09 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Complementary therapies, including homeopathic medicines, are used by many patients with cancer, usually alongside orthodox treatments. A systematic review of 26 surveys from 13 countries reported that up to 64% of patients with cancer (average 31.4%) used complementary therapies at some stage of their illness (<LINK REF="REF-Ernst-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ernst 1998</LINK>). Another study found that homeopathy was in the top five most commonly used complementary therapies in seven out of 14 European countries by patients with cancer (<LINK REF="REF-Molassiotis-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Molassiotis 2005</LINK>). Homeopathic medicines are used by patients with cancer for symptomatic relief and general supportive care, as well as for adverse effects of cancer treatments. The clinical research to date has focused on homeopathic medicines for adverse effects of cancer treatments (<LINK REF="REF-Milazzo-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Milazzo 2006</LINK>), although it is important to note that this may not fully represent contemporary clinical practice.</P>
<P>Homeopathy is based on the broad concept of treating like with like, whereby a substance that can cause symptoms in a healthy individual can be used to treat patients presenting with similar symptoms. For instance, the homeopathic medicine, Apis mellifica (made from bees) is used to treat conditions characterised by acute onset, marked swellings and pain relieved by cold applications, similar to the effect of a bee sting. The concept is not exclusive to homeopathy and can be found as early as in the writings of the Hippocratic Corpus (5th century BC) and in Paracelsus (late 15th century AD). It was the German physician, Samuel Hahnemann, (1755 to 1843) who developed this idea systematically and into a medical system, and coined the term homeopathy.</P>
<P>Homeopathic prescribing strategies vary and at least four types can be differentiated. In 'classical' or 'individualised' homeopathy, a single homeopathic medicine is prescribed according to the individual's presentation and history. In 'clinical' homeopathy, the same homeopathic medicine is used for a group of patients with the same clinical condition e.g. Rhus tox for arthritis. In 'complex' homeopathy more than one homeopathic medicine is used in a fixed combination or concurrently for a particular condition. In 'isopathy' the homeopathic medicine is based on the causal agent e.g. grass pollens for hay fever (<LINK REF="REF-Linde-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Linde 1997</LINK>). Related medical systems which use homeopathic medicines include Homotoxicology which was founded by HH Reckeweg (1905 to 1985) and is based on interpreting disease as an expression of the defensive effort of the organism against pathogenic toxins and detoxification with homeopathic medicines.</P>
<P>Homeopathic medicines are thought to be generally safe, both as regards adverse effects and interactions with other drugs. In a systematic review of adverse effects of homeopathy, the authors concluded that homeopathic medicines in high dilutions (i.e. very dilute), prescribed by trained professionals, are probably safe and unlikely to provoke severe adverse reactions. The main risks are indirect, pertaining to the practitioners, rather than the medicines. There is likely to be under-reporting of adverse effects. There is also confusion between homeopathic and herbal medicines in the reporting of adverse effects (<LINK REF="REF-Dantas-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dantas 2000</LINK>). This is particularly pertinent to cancer management as there is an increased awareness that some herbal medicines e.g. St John's Wort may interfere with some chemotherapy agents. The main risks of homeopathy are indirect; including patients rejecting or delaying conventional therapy with its substantial benefits including possible cure.</P>
<P>The most controversial aspect of homeopathy is the use of high dilutions. Homeopathic medicines can be prepared from botanical, zoological, mineral, chemical, microbiological or synthetic materials. The starting point is the Mother Tincture, an alcoholic extract of the original substance. Insoluble substances are initially triturated (ground) with lactose before being suspended in the alcoholic diluent.</P>
<P>The mother tincture is subjected to a process termed potentisation which consists of serial dilution with succussion (a form of vigorous shaking) at each stage of dilution. A decimal (tenfold) dilution is denoted by the letter 'x' after, or 'D' before, the number of dilutions e.g. 3x/D3. A centesimal (hundredfold) dilution is denoted by the letters 'c' or 'cH' after the number of dilutions e.g. 30c/30cH. If a number is used without a letter prefix or suffix, centesimal dilution is generally implied.</P>
<P>Homeopathic medicines can be used in the concentrated form of a mother tincture or low dilution, either ingested (typically a few millilitres per day) or in topical preparations such as creams or ointments. In the concentrated form, they have potential for interactions with other drugs.</P>
<P>Homeopathic medicines can be diluted beyond Avogadro's number (also known as Loschmidt's Constant: the number of atoms or molecules in a mole of substance, which is of the order of 10<SUP>23</SUP>), and at this stage the original substance has almost certainly been diluted out. Such dilutions are termed ultramolecular, and 12c or 23x/D23 are unlikely to contain molecules of the starting substance, but the molecular threshold is usually crossed before this dilution, depending factors include initial concentration and molecular weight. The leading current hypothesis to explain the effects of ultramolecular dilutions is the 'Information Theory Hypothesis' which states: "Water, and other polar solvents can, under specific conditions store specific information about substances with which they have previously been in contact and subsequently transmit this information to presensitised biosystems" (<LINK REF="REF-Fisher-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fisher 1998</LINK>), although this hypothesis has no convincing evidence to support it and does not seem plausible within a modern scientific framework. Despite the inherent implausibility of ultramolecular dilutions and the controversy surrounding their use, this review includes all types of homeopathic medicines because in clinical practice both ultramolecular dilutions and material doses are used for patients with cancer.</P>
<P>The question this review seeks to address is: Are homeopathic medicines effective and safe in the prevention and treatment of adverse effects of cancer treatments? The scope of this review has been kept deliberately broad to include adverse effects of all standard cancer management strategies including radiotherapy, chemotherapy, surgery, biological and hormonal therapies.</P>

Both groups used a topical medication containing fluocortolone, generally prescribed at the start of radiotherapy. Skin reactions to radiotherapy were assessed by physicians using ordinal scales rating skin colour and heat to touch, and nominal scales rating hyperpigmentation and oedema. Assessments were made weekly during the six week radiotherapy course and at 15 and 30 days after radiotherapy was completed. Total severity during radiotherapy and during recovery were calculated as the sum of all four parameters.

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2009-02-04 17:42:01 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jessica R Thomas">
<P>This review analysed eight studies of homeopathic medicines for the prevention or treatment of adverse effects of chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and menopausal symptoms caused by hormonal therapies or oestrogen withdrawal. Homeopathic medicines were evaluated because despite many available conventional therapies, troublesome symptoms are still commonly experienced and homeopathy is perceived by some patients as a safe, acceptable adjunct to conventional management.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Included studies</HEADING>
<P>Eight studies with a total of 664 participants met the inclusion criteria: three studies tested homeopathic medicines for adverse effects of radiotherapy; three studies tested homeopathic medicine for adverse effects of chemotherapy; and two studies tested homeopathic medicines for menopausal symptoms due either to oestrogen withdrawal or hormonal therapies as part of the treatment of breast cancer.</P>
<P>One of the three studies on adverse effects of radiotherapy was of high quality and low risk of bias. It demonstrated superiority of a topical calendula preparation over trolamine (a topical agent which does not contain corticosteroids) in preventing acute dermatitis during radiotherapy in 254 women with breast cancer (<LINK REF="STD-Pommier-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Pommier 2004</LINK>). The other two studies reported positive results for skin reactions and other adverse effects of radiotherapy, however, these studies had an unclear risk of bias (<LINK REF="STD-Balzarini-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Balzarini 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kulkarni-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Kulkarni 1988</LINK>).</P>
<P>There were three studies on adverse effects of chemotherapy. One study with 32 participants had a low risk of bias and demonstrated benefit from Traumeel S (a proprietary complex homeopathic medicine) used as a mouth wash in the treatment of chemotherapy-induced stomatitis (<LINK REF="STD-Oberbaum-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Oberbaum 2001</LINK>). The remaining two studies were negative, one had an unclear risk of bias (<LINK REF="STD-Daub-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Daub 2005</LINK>) and the other had a high risk of bias (<LINK REF="STD-Bourgois-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Bourgois 1984</LINK>).</P>
<P>The two studies of homeopathic medicines on menopausal symptoms were of high quality and low risk of bias. The primary outcomes in these trials did not provide evidence for the efficacy of homeopathic medicines over placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Jacobs-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Jacobs 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Thompson-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Thompson 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>No serious adverse effects that could be attributed to homeopathic medicines or interactions with conventional treatment were reported in the included studies.</P>
<P>No cancer treatments were stopped due to homeopathic interventions and one study showed less frequent interruptions of radiotherapy in the group receiving the homeopathic intervention (<LINK REF="STD-Pommier-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Pommier 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>The positive studies with low risk of bias in this review used homeopathic medicines with material doses. Calendula has anti-inflammatory actions when applied topically which may explain any effects seen in this trial. Many of the constituents in Traumeel S also have anti-inflammatory effects, but whether this mechanism of action operates at these doses is uncertain.</P>

<P>This review was based on a wide ranging and comprehensive literature search.</P>
<P>It is difficult to draw firm conclusions because of the paucity of evidence, clinical heterogeneity and lack of repetition of the included trials. We found eight eligible studies which examined a total of 10 interventions. Most studies were small (only one had over 100 participants, <LINK REF="STD-Pommier-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Pommier 2004</LINK>), and only two examined the same treatment for the same condition (individualised homeopathy for menopausal or oestrogen withdrawal symptoms) (<LINK REF="STD-Thompson-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Thompson 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jacobs-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Jacobs 2005</LINK>). But even here there is considerable heterogeneity, as both allowed unrestricted individualised homeopathic prescribing resulting in substantial differences in treatments used. In one study (<LINK REF="STD-Jacobs-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Jacobs 2005</LINK>), a total of 35 different homeopathic medicines were prescribed, in the other (<LINK REF="STD-Thompson-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Thompson 2005</LINK>), 71. Of the five most frequently prescribed medicines, only two were common to both studies. Furthermore the studies used qualitatively different outcomes: <LINK REF="STD-Jacobs-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Jacobs 2005</LINK> focused on menopausal symptoms, <LINK REF="STD-Thompson-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Thompson 2005</LINK> used MYMOP as the primary outcome, this is based on change in symptoms nominated by the patient. Further data regarding individualised homeopathy is listed in the '<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>' table.</P>

<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2009-02-05 15:45:28 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jessica Thomas">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2009-02-05 15:45:20 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jessica Thomas">
<P>Prophylactic use of calendula ointment may be considered as an option for patients undergoing radiotherapy for breast cancer, although this intervention requires further evaluation. Compared with trolamine, it reduced the incidence of acute dermatitis of grade two or above in women undergoing radiotherapy for breast cancer in one clinical trial involving 254 participants. The calendula ointment used in this study was prepared according to the German Homeopathic Pharmacopoeia and so the results may not apply to topical preparations of calendula extracts prepared by different methods.</P>
<P>There is no convincing evidence for the efficacy of other homeopathic medicines for adverse symptoms and skin reactions related to radiotherapy. Two small studies were positive but both had an unclear risk of bias.</P>
<P>Based on a single trial involving 32 participants, one particular homeopathic combination (Traumeel S - a proprietary complex homeopathic medicine) appears to show promise in the treatment of chemotherapy-induced stomatitis.</P>
<P>High quality trials to date provide no evidence for the efficacy of homeopathic medicines over placebo in women with breast cancer suffering from menopausal symptoms.</P>
<P>No serious adverse effects that could be attributed to homeopathic medicines or interactions with conventional treatment were reported in the included studies. No cancer treatments were modified or stopped because of the homeopathic interventions.<BR/>
</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2009-02-05 15:45:28 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jessica Thomas">
<P>Further studies are warranted using calendula ointment for acute dermatitis in patients undergoing radiotherapy. It may be worthwhile considering different formulations since 30% of participants reported that the ointment was difficult to apply.</P>
<P>Further independent trials of Traumeel S for cancer treatment associated mucositis are warranted, and one is underway (<LINK REF="STD-Sadhev-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Sadhev 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>Further RCTs of homeopathic medicines for adverse symptoms and skin reactions related to radiotherapy are needed to confirm the results described in this review. Since patients frequently use homeopathic medicines for general supportive care, rather than control of specific symptoms, outcome measures should be broader than those used in some of the included studies, and should differentiate between symptoms as well as using global and quality of life scores. Radiotherapy-associated fatigue might be considered as a separate outcome, and observation beyond the end of radiotherapy should be included.</P>
<P>In the design of future studies of individualised homeopathy, consideration should be given to the possibility of an interaction between effects attributable to the homeopathic consultation and those of the homeopathic medicine itself.</P>

He left the hospital in 2005 and took up his post as Director of Research for Heel in Germany in 2006 (the company that makes Traumeel S, one of the interventions included in this review). Prior to his leaving, we had run some of the searches and identified some potential studies but had not gone through the process of formally selecting studies for inclusion into the review. He had no input into the selection of included studies, data extraction, quality assessment or interpretation of the analysis. On finally approving the publication, he did not make any recommendations for change to the implications for clinical practice, research or to the conclusions, but commented on it critically for intellectual content. </P>

<P>Robbert van Haselen (RvH) conceived the idea and with Sosie Kassab (SK) developed the protocol. All authors contributed to the concept and design of the study. The search strategy was developed by SK and the Trials Search Coordinator of the PaPaS Review Group. SK did the handsearching and with Peter Fisher (PF) contacted practitioners and researchers in the field. SK and Saul Berkovitz (SB) reviewed results of the searches and included studies into the review. SB facilitated translations of papers. Disagreement on the inclusion or exclusion of studies were discussed by SB, Mike Cummings (MC), PF and SK. Data was extracted by MC and SK and quality assessed by SB, MC and SK. Authors and manufacturers were contacted by MC, PF and SK for additional information. MC entered data into RevMan. SB, MC, PF and SK interpreted the analysis. MC and SK drafted the final review. SB and PF commented on it critically for intellectual content. All authors finally approved the document for publication.</P>

<P>
<B>Adverse reactions</B>
<BR/>No adverse reactions to calendula were reported</P>
<P>
<B>Modification or cessation of cancer treatments</B>
<BR/>Treatment interruptions: one in the calendula group for a reason unrelated to radiotherapy and 15 interruptions in the trolamine group, 12 because of skin toxicity, one due to a lymphocoele abscess and two unrelated to radiotherapy. The mean length of treatment interruption in the trolamine group was 10 days (range 2-22 days).<BR/>

<FEEDBACK_SUMMARY MODIFIED="2012-03-15 17:05:23 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This comment pertains to the Pommier article included in this review. This article did not involve a homeopathic remedy and yet was included as one of the key studies within this review on homeopathy. Should it not have been excluded from the review for this simple reason? And, if it were excluded, wouldn't the conclusions drawn in the review article be quite different?</P>
</FEEDBACK_SUMMARY>
<FEEDBACK_REPLY MODIFIED="2012-03-15 17:09:05 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The selection criteria for the intervention was any use of homeopathic medicines prepared in accordance with officially recognised homeopathic pharmacopoeias. Where there was any doubt about the classification of the medicine, we contacted the authors or product manufacturers for clarification. (See 'Methods' under '<LINK TAG="CRIT_INTERVENTIONS" TYPE="SECTION">Types of interventions</LINK>').</P>
<P>We contacted the manufacturer of the calendula ointment. 'Further information was obtained from the manufacturer of one of the potential studies to establish whether the intervention met the inclusion criteria (<LINK REF="STD-Pommier-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Pommier 2004</LINK>)'. (See '<LINK TAG="DATA_COLLECTION" TYPE="SECTION">Data collection and analysis</LINK>' under '<LINK TAG="STUDY_SELECTION" TYPE="SECTION">Selection of studies</LINK>').</P>
<P>The manufacturer confirmed that it had been prepared in accordance with the German homeopathic pharmacopoeia (see '<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>'). Therefore the study met our inclusion criteria.</P>
<P>This has caused some degree of reaction from commentators who mistakenly believe that homeopathic medicines are always highly diluted substances (see '<LINK TAG="BACKGROUND" TYPE="SECTION">Background</LINK>' of review). Homeopathic medicines in material doses and high dilutions are both used in patients with cancer, and we wanted the review to reflect clinical practice.</P>

<P>Comment: In view of the recent review and associated publications about homeopathy led by Paul Glaziou, I am worried that this Cochrane Review and any others concluding however cautiously that there may be some benefit in homeopathic treatments, when at least two of the authors of the review have a declared conflict of interest is problematic.</P>

<P>
<B>Author Response</B>: We have reviewed the relevant parts of the review of reviews performed by the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) of Australia entitled &#8216;NHMRC Statement on Homeopathy and NHMRC Information Paper - Evidence on the effectiveness of homeopathy for treating health conditions.&#8217; In this review of reviews our review (Kassab 2011) received an AMSTAR score of 9/10 i.e., a high score for internal validity. It is of interest that this review of reviews did not list the RCT by Pommier et al 2004 &#8211; the one large trial with a low risk of bias that appeared to show a benefit for topical calendula over trolamine. This trial met our inclusion criteria, but caused some controversy from commentators that did not read our methods or background thoroughly, and mistakenly assumed that all homeopathic medicines by definition must be highly diluted. We discussed this in detail in the background section of our review.</P>
<P>All potential conflict of interests were declared at the time of registration and publication of protocol and review.</P>
<P>
<B>Editor Response</B>: We have investigated further the authors&#8217; Declarations of Interest. In Cochrane we have substantially improved our guidance and practice since 2008. Although it can be challenging to historically investigate reviews, there were three issues in the published DoIs that needed clarification. First, there are no declarations from 2 of the 5 authors. We have sought these and state them as: SB: none known and MC: none known.</P>
<P>Second, there is mention of a funding organization &#8216;ViFAB&#8217;. We have investigated this and found that was a publically funded governmental research agency (now defunct). Third, we sought and received reassurance that RvH who was an author on the protocol, ceased any contribution once he had left his hospital role for a commercial role.</P>
