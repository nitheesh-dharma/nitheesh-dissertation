<DESCRIPTION>
<P>This update was initiated following feedback from Dr. Robin Ohls. Our inclusion of the study by Dr. Romagnoli and co-workers (<LINK REF="STD-Romagnoli-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Romagnoli 2000</LINK>) in the early EPO review was questioned by Dr. Robin Ohls, who suggested the study should be included in the late EPO review. We contacted Dr. Romagnoli and he informed us that the mean ( SD) age of the infants when EPO treatment was started was 10  1 days. We therefore moved the study to this Late EPO review.</P>
<P>As expected, when this study (n = 230) was added the results of the meta-analyses changed. The outcome of BPD (defined as need for supplemental oxygen at 28 days of life) is now of borderline statistical significance with an increased risk in the EPO group. Becasue of the very high heterogeneity (I = 97%) the results should be interpreted with caution.</P>
<P>Our decision to divide the EPO studies into early and late based on initiating EPO treatment at the cut-off of &#8804; 7 days of age for early and &gt; 7 days for late treatment with EPO, although somewhat arbitrary, was chosen based on previously published meta-analyses (<LINK REF="REF-Garcia-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Garcia 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kotto_x002d_Kome-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kotto-Kome 2004</LINK>) to allow us to compare the results between our reviews and previously published reviews.</P>
<P>In this update there is a trend towards a non-significant increased risk of retinopathy (ROP) of prematurity.</P>
<P>The concern for an increased risk of ROP is real and because of the arbitrary cut-off age for early vs late EPO treatment we decided post hoc to perform a secondary analysis including all studies that reported on ROP stage &#8805; 3 regardless of the age at initiation of EPO treatment. This analysis is included in the updated Early EPO review and shows an increased risk of ROP &#8805; 3 when all studies of EPO regardless of age at initiation of the treatment were included in the analysis.</P>

<P>
<B>Review question</B>
</P>
<P>We reviewed the evidence about the effectiveness and safety of late initiation of erythropoietin treatment between eight and 28 days after birth, in reducing the use of red blood cell (RBC) transfusions in preterm and/or low birth weight infants.</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>The percentage of circulating red blood cells (hematocrit) falls after birth in all infants. This is particularly true in preterm infants due to their poor response to anaemia and to the amount of blood that is drawn for necessary testing. Low plasma levels of erythropoietin (a substance in the blood that stimulates red blood cell production) in preterm infants provide a rationale for the use of erythropoietin to prevent/treat anaemia.</P>
<P>
<B>Search date</B>
</P>
<P>The evidence is current to July, 2013.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>To date 1591 infants (between eight and 28 days of age) born preterm have been enrolled in 30 studies of late administration of EPO to reduce the use of red blood cell transfusions and to prevent donor exposure. </P>
<P>
<B>Study funding sources</B>
</P>
<P>We as reviewers have not received any funding for this review and we have no conflict of interest to declare.</P>
<P>
<B>Key findings</B>
</P>
<P>The risk of receiving red blood transfusion is reduced following initiation of EPO treatment. However, the overall benefit of EPO is reduced as many of these infants had been exposed to donor blood prior to entry into the trials. Treatment with late EPO did not have any important effects on death or common complications of preterm birth, except for trends in an increased risk for retinopathy of prematurity. Retinopathy of prematurity is a disease of the eye affecting babies born preterm. It is thought to be caused by disorganized growth of retinal blood vessels, which may result in scarring and retinal detachment. Retinopathy of prematurity can be mild and may resolve spontaneously, but it may lead to blindness in serious cases. </P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
</P>
<P>The study quality varied and important information regarding the random sequence generation and whether the allocation was concealed or not was often missing. Sample sizes were small and long-term outcomes (18 to 24 months corrected age) were not reported.</P>

<P>We include 30 studies (31 comparisons) randomising 1591 preterm infants. Literature searches in 2013 did not identify any new study for inclusion. For this update we moved one study enrolling 230 infants from the early EPO review to this late EPO review.</P>
<P>Most included trials were of small sample size. The meta-analysis showed a significant effect of the use of one or more RBC transfusions (20 studies (n = 1142); typical risk ratio (RR) 0.71, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.64 to 0.79; typical risk difference (RD) -0.17, 95% CI -0.22 to -0.12; typical number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 6, 95% CI 5 to 8). There was moderate heterogeneity for this outcome (RR I<SUP> </SUP>= 68%; RD I<SUP> </SUP>= 60%). We obtained similar results in secondary analyses based on different combinations of high/low doses of EPO and iron supplementation. There was no significant reduction in the total volume (mL/kg) of blood transfused per infant [typical mean difference (MD) -1.6 mL/kg, 95% CI -5.8 to 2.6); 5 studies, 197 infants]. There was high heterogeneity for this outcome (I = 92%). There was a significant reduction in the number of transfusions per infant (11 studies enrolling 817 infants; typical MD -0.22, 95% CI -0.38 to -0.06). There was high heterogeneity for this outcome (I = 94%).</P>
<P>Three studies including 404 infants reported on retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) (all stages or stage not reported), with a typical RR 1.27 (95% CI 0.99 to 1.64) and a typical RD of 0.09 (95% CI -0.00 to 0.18). There was high heterogeneity for this outcome for both RR (I = 83%) and RD (I = 82%). Three trials enrolling 442 infants reported on ROP (stage &#8805; 3). The typical RR was 1.73 (95% CI 0.92 to 3.24) and the typical RD was 0.05 (95% CI -0.01 to 0.10). There was minimal heterogeneity for this outcome for RR (I = 18%) but high heterogeneity for RD (I = 79%). There were no significant differences in other clinical outcomes. There was no reduction in necrotizing enterocolitis in spite of a reduction in the use of RBC transfusions. Long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes were not reported.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2013-11-19 14:42:57 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Late administration of EPO reduces the use of one or more RBC transfusions, the number of RBC transfusions per infant (&lt; 1 transfusion per infant) but not the total volume (ml/kg) of RBCs transfused per infant. Any donor exposure is likely not avoided as most studies included infants who had received RBC transfusions prior to trial entry. Late EPO does not significantly reduce or increase any clinically important adverse outcomes except for a trend in increased risk for ROP. Further research of the use of late EPO treatment to prevent donor exposure is not indicated. Research efforts should focus on limiting donor exposure during the first few days of life in sick neonates, when RBC requirements are most likely to be required and cannot be prevented by late EPO treatment. The use of satellite packs (dividing one unit of donor blood into many smaller aliquots) may reduce donor exposure. </P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2013-11-23 11:27:43 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>After birth, the haemoglobin concentration of newborn infants falls to minimal levels of 11 g/dL in term infants by eight to 12 weeks of age, and 7.0 to 10.0 g/dL in preterm infants by six weeks of age (<LINK REF="REF-Stockman-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stockman 1978</LINK>). This process is called physiologic anaemia of infancy (<LINK REF="REF-Strauss-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Strauss 1986</LINK>). In very low birth weight (VLBW) infants, the hematocrit falls to approximately 24% in infants weighing 1.0 to 1.5 kg and to 21% in infants weighing less than 1.0 kg at birth (<LINK REF="REF-Stockman-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stockman 1986</LINK>). In extremely low birth weight (ELBW) infants, this decline in hematocrit is not 'physiologic', as it may be associated with clinical findings that prompt red blood cell transfusions. To our knowledge, the diagnostic accuracy of different clinical signs and laboratory findings has not been studied (<LINK REF="REF-Cohen-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cohen 1998</LINK>). It is still unknown how low hematocrit levels can fall before clinical signs of anaemia occur and what is the minimum hematocrit level acceptable in infants requiring supplemental oxygen (<LINK REF="REF-Ohls-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ohls 2002</LINK>). Nevertheless, 'top-up' transfusions to treat low haemoglobin or low hematocrit levels are frequently used. As many as 80% of VLBW infants and 95% of ELBW infants receive blood transfusions during their hospitalisations (<LINK REF="REF-Widness-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Widness 1996</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2014-04-16 12:07:28 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Erythropoietin (EPO) and iron effectively stimulate erythropoiesis. Plasma erythropoietin levels in neonates are lower than those of older children and adults. <LINK REF="REF-Brown-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brown 1983</LINK> reported that between two and 30 days of life the mean EPO concentration was 10 mU/mL, as compared to 15 mU/mL in concurrently studied adults. A low plasma EPO level is a key reason that nadir hematocrit values of preterm infants are lower than those of term infants (<LINK REF="REF-Dallman-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dallman 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stockman-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stockman 1986</LINK>). Low plasma EPO levels provide a rationale for the use of EPO in the prevention or treatment of anaemia of prematurity. Studies in newborn monkeys and sheep have demonstrated that neonates have a large volume of distribution and more rapid elimination of EPO, necessitating the use of higher doses than are required for adults (<LINK REF="REF-Ohls-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ohls 2000</LINK>). A systematic review of EPO administration noted a wide range of doses used, from 90 to 1400 IU/kg/week (<LINK REF="REF-Kotto_x002d_Kome-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kotto-Kome 2004</LINK>). Side effects reported in adults include hypertension, bone pain, rash and (rarely) seizures. Only transient neutropenia has been reported in neonates (<LINK REF="REF-Ohls-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ohls 2000</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2013-11-23 11:27:58 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The primary goal of EPO therapy is to reduce transfusions. Most transfusions are given during the first three to four weeks of life. The larger or stable preterm infants who respond best to EPO receive few transfusions. ELBW infants, who are sick and have the greatest need for red blood cell (RBC) transfusions shortly after birth, have not consistently responded to EPO. This suggests that EPO is a more effective erythropoietic stimulator in more mature neonates. ELBW neonates are more likely to need transfusions even if their erythropoiesis is stimulated (<LINK REF="REF-Kotto_x002d_Kome-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kotto-Kome 2004</LINK>). In addition, ELBW neonates have a smaller blood volume and the relatively larger phlebotomy volumes that are required during hospital stay often necessitate 'early' transfusions. In contrast, 'late' transfusions are more often given because of anaemia of prematurity (<LINK REF="REF-Garcia-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Garcia 2002</LINK>). Most preterm infants who require blood transfusions will receive their first transfusion in the first two weeks of life (<LINK REF="REF-Zipursky-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zipursky 2000</LINK>). Reducing the number of RBC transfusions reduces the risk of transmission of viral infections and may reduce costs. Frequent RBC transfusions may be associated with retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) (<LINK REF="REF-Hesse-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hesse 1997</LINK>) and bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD).</P>
<P>In preterm infants, iron is needed for erythropoiesis. As neonatal blood volume expands with rapid growth, infants produce large amounts of haemoglobin. Several studies have observed a decrease in serum ferritin concentration (an indication of iron deficiency (<LINK REF="REF-Finch-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Finch 1982</LINK>) during erythropoietin treatment). The use of higher, more effective doses of erythropoietin might be expected to increase iron demand and the risk of iron deficiency. Iron supplementation during erythropoietin treatment has been observed to reduce the risk of the development of iron deficiency (<LINK REF="STD-Shannon-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Shannon 1995</LINK>). The range of iron doses used in EPO-treated infants is between 1 mg/kg/day to 10 mg/kg/day (<LINK REF="REF-Kotto_x002d_Kome-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kotto-Kome 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>EPO has been found to have important non-hematopoietic functions in the brain and other organs during development (<LINK REF="REF-Juul-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Juul 2002</LINK>). Administration of EPO could potentially have a neuro protective effect in preterm infants, especially in perinatal asphyxia (<LINK REF="REF-Dame-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dame 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Juul-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Juul 2002</LINK>). This aspect of EPO use in neonates will be systematically reviewed separately (<LINK REF="REF-Yu-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yu 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>It is likely that additional studies of EPO in preterm or LBW infants have been published since the reviews noted above, which included reports up to October 2002. We have performed a series of Cochrane reviews on the use of EPO in preterm infants, including: <I>Early erythropoietin for preventing red blood cell transfusion in preterm and/or low birth weight infants (</I>
<LINK REF="REF-Ohlsson-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ohlsson 2012</LINK>), this review (Late erythropoietin; <LINK REF="REF-Aher-2012a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aher 2012a</LINK>), and <I>Early versus late erythropoietin to prevent red blood cell transfusion in preterm and/or low birth weight infants</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Aher-2012b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aher 2012b</LINK>). The cut-off of seven days of age or less for 'early' and more than seven days for 'late' treatment with EPO, although somewhat arbitrary, was chosen based on previously published meta-analyses (<LINK REF="REF-Garcia-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Garcia 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kotto_x002d_Kome-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kotto-Kome 2004</LINK>), and allowed us to compare the results between our reviews and previously published reviews.</P>

<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2013-11-04 10:04:33 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review concerns late administration of EPO (starting in infants between eight and 28 days of age, after reaching 40 weeks postmenstrual age (PMA)). The main rationale for such EPO therapy is to avoid exposure of neonates to multiple blood donors and the risks associated with this exposure. It is likely that many sick neonates would have received a transfusion prior to entry into trials enrolling infants more than seven days of age. We carried out a systematic review to evaluate all available studies where EPO was begun after seven days of life, to assess the effect on the use of one or more red blood cell transfusions in preterm/very low birth weight infants.</P>

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2013-11-08 06:04:20 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We used the standard methods of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group. We assessed the methodological quality of the studies using the following key criteria: allocation concealment (blinding of randomisation), blinding of intervention, completeness of follow-up, and blinding of outcome measurement/assessment. For each criterion, the assessment was low risk, high risk, or unclear risk of bias. Two review authors separately assessed each study, resolving any disagreement by discussion. This information was added to the <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK> table.</P>
<P>For the 2012 and 2013 updates, one review author (AO) evaluated the following issues and entered them into the 'Risk of bias' table, and in 2013 the other review author (SMA) checked the information.</P>
<P>
<B>Selection bias </B>(random sequence generation and allocation concealment).<BR/>For each included study, we categorised the risk of selection bias as:<BR/>
<BR/>
<I>Random sequence generation:</I>
<BR/>Low risk - adequate (any truly random process e.g. random number table; computer random number generator);<BR/>High risk - inadequate (any non-random process e.g. odd or even date of birth; hospital or clinic record number);<BR/>Unclear risk - no or unclear information provided.</P>
<P>
<I>Allocation concealment:</I>
<BR/>Low risk - adequate (e.g. telephone or central randomisation; consecutively numbered sealed opaque envelopes);<BR/>High risk - inadequate (open random allocation; unsealed or non-opaque envelopes, alternation; date of birth);<BR/>Unclear risk - no or unclear information provided.</P>
<P>
<B>Performance bias</B>
<BR/>For each included study, we categorised the methods used to blind study personnel from knowledge of which intervention a participant received. (As our study population consisted of neonates they would all be blinded to the study intervention).<BR/>Low risk - adequate for personnel (a placebo that could not be distinguished from the active drug was used in the control group);<BR/>High risk - inadequate - personnel aware of group assignment;<BR/>Uncelar risk - no or unclear information provided.</P>
<P>
<B>Detection bias</B>
<BR/>For each included study, we categorised the methods used to blind outcome assessors from knowledge of which intervention a participant received. (As our study population consisted of neonates they would all be blinded to the study intervention). Blinding was assessed separately for different outcomes or classes of outcomes. We categorised the methods used with regards to detection bias as:<BR/>Low risk - adequate; follow-up was performed with assessors blinded to group;<BR/>High risk - inadequate; assessors at follow-up were aware of group assignment;<BR/>Unclear risk - no or unclear information provided.</P>
<P>
<B>Attrition bias</B>
</P>
<P>For each included study and for each outcome, we describe the completeness of data including attrition and exclusions from the analysis. We noted whether attrition and exclusions were reported, the numbers included in the analysis at each stage (compared with the total randomised participants), reasons for attrition or exclusion where reported, and whether missing data were balanced across groups or were related to outcomes. Where sufficient information was reported or supplied by the trial authors, we re-included missing data in the analyses. We categorised the methods with respect to the risk attrition bias as:<BR/>Low risk - adequate (&lt; 10% missing data);<BR/>High risk - inadequate (&#8805; 10% missing data);<BR/>Unclear risk - no or unclear information provided.</P>
<P>
<B>Reporting bias</B>
</P>
<P>For each included study, we describe how we investigated the risk of selective outcome reporting bias and what we found. We assessed the methods as:<BR/>Low risk - adequate (where it is clear that all of the study's prespecified outcomes and all expected outcomes of interest to the review have been reported);<BR/>High risk - inadequate (where not all the study's prespecified outcomes have been reported; one or more reported primary outcomes were not prespecified; outcomes of interest are reported incompletely and so cannot be used; study fails to include results of a key outcome that would have been expected to have been reported);<BR/>Unclear risk - no or unclear information provided (the study protocol was not available).</P>
<P>
<B>Other bias</B>
</P>
<P>For each included study, we describe any important concerns we had about other possible sources of bias (for example, whether there was a potential source of bias related to the specific study design or whether the trial was stopped early due to some data-dependent process). We assessed whether each study was free of other problems that could put it at risk of bias as:<BR/>Low risk - no concerns of other bias raised;<BR/>High risk - concerns raised about multiple checks of the data with the results made known to the investigators, difference in number of infants enrolled in abstract and final publications of the paper;<BR/>Unclear - concerns raised about potential sources of bias that could not be verified by contacting the authors. If needed, we planned to explore the impact of the level of bias through undertaking sensitivity analyses.<BR/>

<P>For this feedback-initiated update the study by Romagnoli (<LINK REF="STD-Romagnoli-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Romagnoli 2000</LINK>) was moved from the early EPO review (<LINK REF="REF-Ohlsson-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ohlsson 2012</LINK>) to this late EPO review as the infants were of a mean (SD) age of 10 ( 1) days at the initiation of EPO treatment. The study enrolled 230 infants. The 2012 update identified one new study for inclusion. As a result 30 studies (31 comparisons) including 1591 preterm and or low birth weight infants met the inclusion criteria. These studies were performed in 21 countries (Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Israel, Italy, Japan, Norway, South Africa, Spain, Switzerland, Taiwan (Republic of China), the UK, Turkey, the USA). We decided to include studies that enrolled some infants who were less than 8 days at study entry. We made one further deviation from our protocol, as we included studies that enrolled infants beyond 28 days of age. Most of these studies enrolled some infants who were less than 28 days old but the inclusion criteria did not have 28 days of postnatal age as an upper limit. We could not separate data for infants that were under 28 days at enrolment. The inclusion of these studies makes our review more comprehensive. The age at enrolment is stated for each study in the table <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>.</P>

<B>Excluded studies</B>
</P>
<P>One study (<LINK REF="STD-Ohls-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Ohls 1991</LINK>) was excluded as it compared an EPO-treated group with a group receiving blood transfusions. Two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Messer-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Messer 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Testa-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Testa 1998</LINK>) were excluded as they were not randomised controlled trials. Two studies reported only as abstracts were excluded as one study from Saudi Arabia lacked information to ascertain whether the study was a randomised controlled trial or not (<LINK REF="STD-Amin-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Amin 2004</LINK>) and the other study conducted in Iran did not provide the age of the infants at the time of enrolment (<LINK REF="STD-Ahmadpour-Kacho-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Ahmadpour Kacho 2004</LINK>). We were unable to contact the authors for additional information. <LINK REF="STD-Warwood-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Warwood 2005</LINK> was a dose-finding study of darepoetin (longer-acting and more potent than EPO). Infants were randomised to receive either one or four microgram/kg of a single dose of darepoetin, without an untreated control group. <LINK REF="STD-Meyer-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Meyer 1996</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Bechensteen-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Bechensteen 1997</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Pathak-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Pathak 2003</LINK> also lacked an untreated control group.

However, as they did not report on any of our prespecified outcomes we excluded them. In the search conducted in 2012, we identified and excluded three additional studies. In <LINK REF="STD-Mohammadzadeh-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Mohammadzadeh 2005</LINK> both groups received EPO. <LINK REF="STD-Warwood-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Warwood 2011</LINK> reported that "only one of the 20 study subjects qualified for and received a subsequent rbc transfusion during the hospitalisation".

The typical mean difference (MD) between the groups was not statistically significant, with a typical MD of -1.61 mL/kg (95% CI -5.78 to 2.57) transfused per infant. There was high heterogeneity (I = 92%). <LINK REF="STD-Corona-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Corona 1998</LINK> (n = 60) reported on this outcome but provided only the means with no standard deviation (SD).

<BR/>
</B>The number of red blood cell transfusions per infant was reported in 11 studies enrolling 817 infants. The significant typical MD was -0.22 (95% CI -0.38 to -0.06) favouring the EPO group. There was high heterogeneity (I = 94%). In <LINK REF="STD-Griffiths-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Griffiths 1997</LINK> (n = 42), the median number of blood transfusions was lower for the infants in the EPO group (difference in medians -2 (95% CI -4 to 0)).<BR/>

<I>
<B>Mortality during initial hospital stay (all causes of mortality) (<U>Outcome 1.7</U>)</B>
</I>
<B>
<BR/>
</B>Thirteen studies (14 comparisons) including 767 infants reported on mortality during initial hospital stay. The non significant typical RR was 0.82 (95% CI 0.49 to 1.39) and the typical RD was -0.01 (95% CI -0.05 to 0.02). There was no statistically significant heterogeneity for this outcome for either RR (I = 0%) or RD (I = 0%).<BR/>

<BR/>Three trials enrolling 442 infants reported on severe ROP (stage &#8805; 3). The typical RR was 1.73 (95% CI 0.92 to 3.24) and the typical RD was 0.05 (95% CI -0.01 to 0.10); neither was statistically significant. There was unimportant heterogeneity for this outcome for RR (I = 18%) but high heterogeneity for RD (I = 79%).<BR/>
<BR/>
<I>
<B>Proven sepsis (Clinical symptoms and signs of sepsis and positive blood culture) (Outcome 1.10)</B>
</I>
<BR/>Five studies including 551 infants reported on this outcome. The typical RR was 0.75 (95% CI 0.52 to 1.09) and the typical RD was -0.05 (95% CI -0.11 to 0.01), neither statistically significant. There was no heterogeneity for this outcome for either RR (I<SUP> </SUP>= 0%) or RD (I = 0%).<BR/>
<BR/>
<I>
<B>Necrotising enterocolitis (NEC) (Bell's stage II or higher) (Outcome 1.11)</B>
</I>
<BR/>Six studies including 656 infants reported on NEC. In some studies the stage was not reported but the results are included in the meta-analyses. The typical RR was 0.88 (95% CI 0.46 to 1.69) and the typical RD -0.01(95% CI -0.04 to 0.03).Neither estimate was statistically significant. There was no heterogeneity for this outcome for either RR (I = 0%) or RD (I = 0%).<BR/>
<BR/>
<I>
<B>Intraventricular haemorrhage (IVH); all grades (<U>Outcome 1.12</U>)</B>
</I>
<BR/>Four studies including 454 infants reported on intraventricular haemorrhage (all grades). In <LINK REF="STD-Samanci-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Samanci 1996</LINK> there were no events in either group and that study is therefore disregarded for the RR. The non-significant typical RR was 0.87 (95% CI 0.53 to 1.42) and typical RD was -0.02 (95% CI -0.07 to 0.04). There was no heterogeneity for either RR (I = 0%) or RD (I = 0%). IVH is probably not a relevant outcome in this review as most haemorrhages occur during the first few days of life and infants were enrolled later in these studies.<BR/>
<BR/>
<I>
<B>Periventricular leukomalacia (PVL); cystic changes in the periventricular areas (<U>Outcome 1.13</U>)</B>
</I>
<BR/>One study enrolling 145 infants reported on PVL. The non-significant RR was 4.80 (95% CI 0.57 to 40.05) and the RD was 0.05 (95% CI -0.01 to 0.12). Test for heterogeneity not applicable.<BR/>

<BR/>Two studies (n = 285) reported on BPD at 28 days. In <LINK REF="STD-Al_x002d_Kharfy-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Al-Kharfy 1996</LINK> all infants in both groups had BPD. The typical RR was 1.25 (95% CI; 1.00 to 1.55) and the RD was 0.10 (95% CI 0.00 to 0.20). There was very high heterogeneity for both RR (I = 97%) and RD (I = 88%). Both results were of borderline statistical significance [test for overall effect: Z = 1.99 (P = 0.05)]. The extremely high heterogeneity for this analysis may relate to the fact that in one study all the infants had BPD at 28 days of age. The results should be interpreted with caution.</P>

<BR/>
<I>
<B>Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) (supplemental oxygen at 36 weeks postmenstrual age (PMA)) (<U>Outcome 1.15</U>)</B>
</I>
<BR/>Three studies enrolling 216 infants reported on the use of supplemental oxygen at 36 weeks PMA. The typical RR was 0.89 (95% CI 0.59 to 1.35) and the typical RD was -0.03 (95% CI-0.15 to 0.08); neither was statistically significant. There was moderate heterogeneity for RR (I = 56%) and for RD (I = 59%).<BR/>
<BR/>
<I>
<B>Sudden infant death (SIDS) after discharge (<U>Outcome 1.16</U>)</B>
</I>
<BR/>Six studies including 363 infants reported on SIDS. The typical RR was 1.06 (95% CI 0.25 to 4.52) and the typical RD was 0.00 (95% CI -0.03 to 0.04). Neither was statistically significant. There was no heterogeneity for either RR (I = 0%) or RD (I = 0%).<BR/>
<BR/>
<I>
<B>Neutropenia (<U>Outcome 1.17</U>)</B>
</I>
<BR/>Five studies (six comparisons) enrolling 164 infants reported on neutropenia. The typical RR was 0.28 (95% CI 0.05 to 1.54) (in only two studies did the outcome of interest occur), and the typical RD was -0.04 (-0.11 to 0.03); neither was statistically significant. There was no heterogeneity for RR (I = 0%) and for RD (I = 0%).<BR/>
<B>
<BR/>
<I>Hypertension (<U>Outcome 1.18</U>)</I>
</B>
<BR/>Seven studies (eight comparisons) including 363 infants reported on hypertension. The RR was 1.20 (95% CI 0.46 to 3.14) and the RD 0.01 (95% CI -0.04 to 0.05); neither was statistically significant. There was no statistically significant heterogeneity for either RR (I = 21%) or RD (I = 0%).<BR/>
<BR/>
<I>
<B>Length of hospital stay (days) (<U>Outcome 1.19</U>)</B>
</I>
<BR/>Length of hospital stay was reported in two studies enrolling 55 infants. There was no significant difference between the groups with a typical MD of -0.35 days (95% CI -12.83 to 12.13). There was no heterogeneity (I = 0%).<BR/>

<BR/>
<B>Secondary (post hoc) analyses:</B>
<BR/>In an attempt to further explore the heterogeneity observed in the primary outcome and subgroup analyses, we performed a post hoc<I> </I>analysis comparing the results of studies that we judged as high quality with those that we identified as of lower quality or could not precisely define their quality because of lack of information. We also compared the results of studies that used strict criteria for red blood cell transfusions to those that used no criteria or less strict criteria.<BR/>

<P>
<I>
<B>Use of one or more blood transfusions (secondary analysis based on quality) (<U>Outcome 1.20</U>)</B>
</I>
<BR/>For five high-quality studies enrolling 357 infants, the typical RR was 0.84 (95% CI 0.73 to 0.96); the typical RD was -0.12 (95% CI -0.21 to -0.03). For 15 studies of uncertain quality enrolling 785 infants, the typical RR was 0.63 (95% CI 0.54 to 0.73) and the typical RD was -0.20 (-0.26 to -0.14). The summary effect size was larger in the studies of poor quality. There was moderate heterogeneity for the high-quality studies (I = 58% for both RR and RD) as well as for the studies of uncertain quality which had higher heterogeneity (I<SUP> </SUP>= 71% for RR and 61% for RD).<BR/>
<BR/>
<I>
<B>Use of one or more blood transfusions (secondary analysis based on criteria for red blood cell transfusions) (<U>Outcome 1.21</U>)</B>
</I>
<BR/>We considered 15 studies enrolling 963 infants to have used strict (although variable) guidelines for red blood cell transfusions, and three studies enrolling 97 infants to have used no criteria or less strict criteria. We excluded two studies for which we were unable to translate the text regarding possible transfusion guidelines (<LINK REF="STD-Yamada-1999a" TYPE="STUDY">Yamada 1999a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yamada-1999b" TYPE="STUDY">Yamada 1999b</LINK>). For the 15 studies using strict red blood cell transfusion guidelines, the typical RR was 0.76 (95% CI 0.68 to 0.85) and the typical RD was -0.15 (95% CI -0.20 to -0.09); NNTB 7 (95% CI 5 to 11). There was moderate heterogeneity for RR (I = 64%) and RD (I = 56%). For the studies using no criteria or less strict criteria, the typical RR was 0.25 (95% CI 0.08 to 0.77) and the typical RD was -0.21 (95% CI -0.36 to -0.07); NNTB 5 (95% CI 3 to 14). There was no heterogeneity for the studies using no criteria or less strict criteria for RR (I = 0%) and RD (I = 0%). The summary effect size was larger for the studies that did not use strict guidelines for red blood cell transfusions compared to those that did.<BR/>
<BR/>
<I>
<B>Funnel plot</B>
</I>
<BR/>A funnel plot for the primary outcome 'Use of one or more red blood cell transfusions' was asymmetric, with a relative absence of smaller studies not having a protective effect (see <LINK REF="FIG-05" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 5</LINK>).<BR/>
<BR/>
<B>Enterally-dosed EPO</B>
<BR/>One study (<LINK REF="STD-Juul-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Juul 2003</LINK>) using enterally-dosed EPO found that the intervention did not significantly influence erythropoiesis or iron utilisation when given for a two-week period, nor did it elevate the serum EPO concentration in preterm or term infants. The authors concluded that enterally-dosed EPO is not an effective substitute for parenteral administration (<LINK REF="STD-Juul-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Juul 2003</LINK>).</P>

<P>The results show that late administration of erythropoietin reduces the use of one or more blood transfusions following study entry. These results were quite consistent (overlapping confidence intervals) when including studies that used both low and high doses of EPO in combination with low and high doses of iron.</P>
<P>With the inclusion of <LINK REF="STD-Romagnoli-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Romagnoli 2000</LINK> in which there was a statistically significant increase in retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) at all stages and at stage 3 or higher, the overall estimates in the meta-analyses now show a trend towards increase for both these outcomes. Three studies including 404 infants reported on ROP (all stages), with a typical RR 1.27 (95% CI 0.99 to 1.64) and a typical RD of 0.09 (95% CI -0.00 to 0.18). This outcome was not statistically significantly different between the groups. There was high heterogeneity for this outcome for both RR ( I = 83%) and RD (I = 82%). Three trials enrolling 442 infants reported on severe ROP (stage 3 or higher). The typical RR was 1.73 (95% CI 0.92 to 3.24) and the typical RD was 0.05 (95% CI -0.01 to 0.10); neither was statistically significant. There was minimal heterogeneity for this outcome for RR (I = 18%) but high heterogeneity for RD (I = 79%). As the cut-off for early EPO treatment versus late EPO treatment was set arbitrarily at 8 completed days of initiation of treatment, we thought it justified to include all studies that have reported on ROP in secondary analyses. Details of these analyses are presented in the 2014 update of the early EPO review (<LINK REF="REF-Ohlsson-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ohlsson 2012</LINK>). We combined all studies that reported on ROP at stage 3 or higher regardless of at what age the EPO treatment was initiated. We included seven studies from the early EPO review and three studies from the late EPO review that reported on this outcome. A total of 10 studies enrolling 1303 infants reported on this outcome. There was a significantly increased risk of ROP stage 3 or higher [typical RR 1.48 (95% CI 1.02 to 2.13); typical RD 0.03 (95% CI 0.00 to 0.06) (P = 0.04 for RR and 0.03 for RD); number needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome (NNTH) 33 (95% CI 17 to infinity)]. There was no heterogeneity for RR (1 = 0%) and moderate (I = 50%) for RD.</P>

<P>The number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) to avoid one red blood cell transfusion was low (range 3 to 8, for different combinations of EPO and iron). The clinical importance of this finding is lessened by the fact that any donor exposure was not avoided, as many infants required red blood cell transfusions prior to study entry. Only two studies reported on donor exposure. In the study by <LINK REF="STD-Bierer-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Bierer 2009</LINK> there was a statistically significant increase in the number of donors the infants were exposed to but not in the study by <LINK REF="STD-Maier-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Maier 2002</LINK>. In the meta analysis of the two studies a significant difference in the typical mean difference for number of transfusions was noted indicating a higher donor exposure number in the EPO group. There was very high heterogeneity for this outcome (I<SUP> </SUP>= 93% ), reducing the importance of the finding. In addition, in the 2012 and 2013 updates there was no statistically significant reduction in the total volume (mL/kg) of blood transfused per infant. There was a small reduction in the mean number of transfusions (0.2) per infant.</P>
<P>The need for intravenous, intramuscular or subcutaneous injections with EPO/iron treatment in the neonatal period is associated with repeated painful stimuli and could potentially have adverse long-term effects. This has not been addressed in any study.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2013-11-23 12:01:39 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The study quality varied and important information regarding the random sequence generation and whether the allocation was concealed or not was often missing. No study was reported according to the 'Consort' statement (<LINK REF="REF-CONSORT-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">CONSORT 2012</LINK>). Sample sizes were small and long-term outcomes (18 to 24 months corrected age) were not reported. In only one study (<LINK REF="STD-Samanci-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Samanci 1996</LINK>) did the authors state that infants were not eligible to enter the study if they had previously received a red blood cell transfusion. Most studies followed guidelines for red blood cell transfusions, although these varied between the studies.</P>
<P>For the primary outcome of 'use of one or more blood transfusions' the typical risk ratio (RR) for five high quality studies was 0.84 (95% CI 0.73 to 0.96). For 15 studies of uncertain quality, the typical RR was 0.63 (95% CI 0.54 to 0.73). The CIs for these analyses are not overlapping, indicating that there are statistically significant differences in the effect sizes between studies that could be ascertained as being of high quality and studies of uncertain quality. There was a reduction in heterogeneity when the high quality studies were analysed separately. Studies of higher quality often show lower effect sizes (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz--1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>). Judging the quality of a study depends to a large extent on the information published, and obtaining additional information from the authors may change the evaluations. The typical effect size for studies that used strict red blood cell transfusion guidelines was smaller (RR 0.76) than for studies that used no or less strict criteria (RR 0.25).</P>
<P>Of concern is the finding of moderate heterogeneity for the primary outcome, including all combinations of low and high EPO and low and high iron treatment. The heterogeneity remained for individual combinations of EPO and iron. The heterogeneity could possibly be explained by the fact that the studies were conducted in 21 countries, with presumably different care practices. Of note, the control rates for red blood cell transfusions varied markedly between studies. As noted in the Additional <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>, there was large variation in the guidelines for red blood cell transfusions. The results of these post hoc analyses should therefore be interpreted with caution.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2013-11-07 09:57:18 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Late EPO administration results in a reduction in the use of one or more red blood cell transfusions following initiation of therapy. It minimally reduces the number of red blood cell transfusions per infant. It is not associated with reductions in mortality or other neonatal morbidities. The use of late EPO is not associated with any short-term serious side effects except for a possible association with retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) stage 3 or higher. A large proportion of extremely low birth weight/preterm neonates require red blood cell transfusions during the first few days of life, when neither early nor late EPO administration could possibly have an impact. The decision to use late EPO will depend on the baseline rate of red blood cell transfusions in this population in a specific neonatal intensive care unit, the costs, the associated pain, and the values assigned to the clinical outcomes. Other means of reducing the need for red blood cell transfusions should be considered, including reduced blood sampling and the use of 'satellite packs' from directed or universal donors.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2013-11-07 09:58:20 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>There is no need for further research to assess the effectiveness of the late use of EPO in reducing red blood cell transfusions. Its effectiveness has been established in populations that were exposed to donor blood prior to study entry, minimising the clinical importance of this effect. Future research should focus on strategies to minimise red blood cell donor exposure (using multiple aliquots from a properly tested single donor) during the first week of life, when the likelihood of need for red blood cell transfusions is at its peak. Such strategies in combination with late EPO treatment may reduce further donor exposure in early infancy. All ongoing and planned studies should monitor the incidence of retinopathy of prematurity.</P>

<P>In our objectives we state that neonates enrolled between eight and 28 days of age were to be included. In the studies that we identified some infants were less than 8 days at study entry and some were older than 28 days. When most of the enrolled infants were 8 days or older we included the studies in this Late EPO review and not in the Early EPO review. The inclusion of these studies makes our review more comprehensive. The age at enrolment is stated for each study in the table <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>. Hypertension was frequently reported by trial authors, and therefore it has been added as an outcome since the protocol was published.</P>

<P>During the first week of life, infants were given transfusions of packed red blood cells for replacement when blood drawn for analysis was in excess of 8 mL/kg of body weight; fresh whole blood was given if signs attributable to hypovolaemia or anaemia developed. Subsequently, infants with heart rate &gt; 180 beats/min, severe, apnoea/bradycardia or poor weight gain (&lt; 10 g/day in spite of a 100 calories/day intake during 5 consecutive days) were transfused if the Hct was &lt; 25% (or &lt; 30% if oxygen or mechanical ventilation was required); asymptomatic infants were transfused only when a central Hct &lt; 23% was reached</P>

<P>The decision to give a blood transfusion to a study infant was made by the medical staff of the neonatal unit who were blinded to the randomisation. The unit policy at the time of the study was to transfuse a preterm infant who had a Hb &lt; 100 g/L and who had symptoms consistent with those caused by anaemia. The symptoms and signs of anaemia included poor feeding, tachycardia, tachypnoea, apnoea, and pallor. Infants with a Hb &lt; 80 g/L were transfused even if asymptomatic</P>

<P>By NICU policy, on admission, infants weighing &lt; 1000 g at birth were assigned 1 unit of packed red blood cells divided into 8 aliquots. These aliquots were used for transfusions during the first month of life. The following transfusion guideline was used for infants of all birth weights: Transfusion is recommended for a Hct &lt; 35% if the infant requires positive pressure with a mean airway pressure &gt; 6 cm water and requires &gt; 35% oxygen. Transfusion is recommended for Hct &lt; 30% if the infant requires oxygen (&lt; 35% FIO2), is receiving continuous positive airway pressure or intubated with mean airway pressure &lt; 6 cm water, if an infant has significant apnoea and bradycardia while receiving methylxanthines (&gt; 9 episodes in 12 hours or 2 episodes in 24 hours requiring mask-and-bag ventilation), if the heart rate is &gt; 180 beats/min or respiratory rate &gt; 80/min and persists for 24 hours, if weight gain &lt; 10 g per day over 4 days despite adequate calories, or in the presence of sepsis. If the Hct is &lt; 20%, no symptoms are necessary for transfusion<BR/>Transfusion volumes were standardised as follows: Infants received an initial transfusion of 15 mL/kg over a period of 3 to 4 hours. A follow-up Hct was checked after 4 hours. If the Hct was &lt; 30%, a second aliquot of 10 mL/kg was given</P>
<P>If the Hct was between 30% and 35%, an additional 5 mL/kg was given<BR/>

<P>Guidelines for red cell transfusions for anaemia of prematurity were based on the existing policy in the nursery, generally adopted by the neonatologists. They were as follows:<BR/>I. Transfuse infants at Hb 80 g/L, (a) If reticulocyte count is &lt; 4% and (b) If receiving supplemental oxygen &gt; 30% or (c) If unexplained recurrent apnoeas/bradycardias are noted (&gt; 1 - 2/hour) or (d) If persistent tachycardia (heart rate &gt; 170/min) or tachypnoea (respiratory rate &gt; 60/min) is noted, or (e) If there is failure to gain weight or successive weight loss on weekly recordings for 3 consecutive weeks. In absence of a clear evidence in the literature justifying red cell transfusions at a Hb of 80 g/L in otherwise asymptomatic neonates who are failing to thrive, it was decided that failure to gain weight or successive weight loss on weekly recordings for 3 consecutive weeks was a fair and substantial clinical indicator of the need to transfuse<BR/>II. Transfuse infants at Hb 100 g/L, (a) If receiving supplemental oxygen 30% and (b) needing intermittent mandatory ventilation or continuous positive airway pressure by nasal prongs for recurrent (&gt; 1 - 2 per hour), apnoeas/bradycardias with saturations &lt; 90% on the pulse oximeter<BR/>III. Transfuse Infants at Hb 120 g/L, (a) If receiving mechanical ventilatory support with mean airway pressure 10 cm of water and supplemental oxygen 30% during the acute phase of illness after birth<BR/>

<FEEDBACK_SUMMARY MODIFIED="2013-11-19 09:32:53 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Our inclusion of the study by Dr. Romagnoli and co-workers (<LINK REF="STD-Romagnoli-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Romagnoli 2000</LINK>) in the Early EPO review was questioned by Dr. Robin Ohls, who suggested the study should be included in the Late EPO review. We contacted Dr. Romagnoli and he informed us that the mean ( SD) age of the infants when EPO treatment was started was 10  1 days. We therefore moved the study to this Late EPO review.</P>
</FEEDBACK_SUMMARY>
<FEEDBACK_REPLY MODIFIED="2013-11-19 09:35:02 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>As expected, when the study by <LINK REF="STD-Romagnoli-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Romagnoli 2000</LINK> (n = 230) was added the results of the meta-analyses changed. The outcome of BPD (defined as need for supplemental oxygen at 28 days of life) is now of borderline statistical significance with an increased risk in the EPO group. Becasue of the very high heterogeneity (I = 97%) the results should be interpreted with caution.</P>
<P>Our decision to divide the EPO studies into early and late based on initiating EPO treatment at the cut-off of &#8804; 7 days of age for early and &gt; 7 days for late treatment with EPO, although somewhat arbitrary, was chosen based on previously published meta-analyses (<LINK REF="REF-Garcia-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Garcia 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kotto_x002d_Kome-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kotto-Kome 2004</LINK>) to allow us to compare the results between our reviews and previously published reviews.</P>
<P>In this update there is a trend towards a non-significant increased risk of retinopathy (ROP) of prematurity.</P>
<P>The concern for an increased risk of ROP is real and because of the arbitrary cut-off age for early vs late EPO treatment we decided post hoc to perform a secondary analysis including all studies that reported on ROP stage &#8805; 3 regardless of the age at initiation of EPO treatment. This analysis is included in the updated Early EPO review and shows an increased risk of ROP &#8805; 3 when all studies of EPO regardless of age at initiation of the treatment were included in the analysis.</P>
