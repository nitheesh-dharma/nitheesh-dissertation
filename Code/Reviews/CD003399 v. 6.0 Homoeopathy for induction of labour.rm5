<P>There is not enough evidence to show the effect of homoeopathy for inducing labour. Sometimes it is necessary to induce labour (getting labour started artificially) when a pregnant woman or her unborn child are at risk. Homoeopathy involves the use of diluted substances which in their undiluted form, cause certain symptoms. The principle is that a homoeopathic substance will stimulate the body and healing functions so that a state of balance is gained and symptoms are relieved. The review of two trials, involving 133 women, found there was not enough evidence to show the effect of a homoeopathy as a method of induction. More research is needed.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2010-02-12 15:21:45 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Sonja L  Henderson">
<P>Two trials, involving 133 women, were included in the review. The trials were placebo controlled and double blind, but the quality was not high. Insufficient information was available on the method of randomisation and the study lacked clinically meaningful outcomes. This trials demonstrated no differences in any primary or secondary outcome between the treatment and control group.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2010-01-14 16:03:56 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is insufficient evidence to recommend the use of homoeopathy as a method of induction. It is likely that the demand for complementary medicine will continue and women will continue to consult a homoeopath during their pregnancy. Although caulophyllum is a commonly used homoeopathic therapy to induce labour, the treatment strategy used in the one trial in which it was evaluated may not reflect routine homoeopathy practice. Rigorous evaluations of individualised homeopathic therapies for induction of labour are needed.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2010-01-14 16:11:52 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Sometimes it is necessary to bring on labour artificially because of safety concerns for the mother or baby. This review is one of a series of reviews of methods of labour induction using a standardised protocol. For more detailed information on the rationale for this methodological approach, please refer to the currently published 'generic' protocol (<LINK REF="REF-Hofmeyr-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hofmeyr 2009</LINK>). The generic protocol describes how a number of standardised reviews will be combined to compare various methods of preparing the cervix of the uterus and inducing labour.<BR/>
<BR/>Homoeopathy is used around the world and is most widely used in Europe and India. Homoeopathy is a form of pharmacological therapy based on the concept that a substance which gives rise to specific symptoms, when given in pharmacological doses to healthy individuals, can be used to treat patients presenting with the same symptoms. This is described as the Law of Similars. Homoeopathy seeks to strengthen the body's immune system, the principle of the treatment being that the homoeopathic substance will stimulate the body and healing functions so that a state of balance is attained and the symptoms are relieved. Homoeopathic remedies are all natural medicines, with some remedies derived from herbs, minerals or other natural substances.</P>
<P>Homeopathic remedies are applied as potencies as a result of tiny and highly diluted amounts of the substances from which they are derived. They are prepared by a process of step by step repeated dilution and vigorous shaking, which is thought to make them capable of stimulating the body's own defence system. The resulting potency is labelled on the basis of the ratio of dilutent and diluted agent (D = decimal dilution = 1/10 diluted agent/dilutent; C = centesimal dilution = 1/100 diluted agent/dilutent) and the number of dilution steps (e.g. C5 indicates 5 dilution steps 1/100). The repetitive dilutions are thought to produce results more quickly, act on symptoms more effectively and are less likely to lead to side effects than the original substances.</P>
<P>The resulting homoeopathic medicine may contain very few or no single molecules of the original solute. For this reason many scientists have suggested the clinical effects resulting from homoeopathic remedies are due to the placebo effect (<LINK REF="REF-Vandenbrouke--1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vandenbrouke 1997</LINK>). However, data from two meta-analyses of placebo controlled clinical trials have found a greater therapeutic effect from homoeopathy compared with the placebo (<LINK REF="REF-Boissel-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boissel 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Linde-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Linde 1997</LINK>). The precise biophysical mechanism underlying homoeopathy remains undefined.</P>
<P>There are different traditions in the prescribing of homoeopathic formulations. Classical homoeopathy refers to the practitioner prescribing a single therapy to treat the individual's illness based on the patient's general constitution. This involves consideration of the individual's current illness, medical history, personality and behaviour. Other practitioners prescribe a combination of homoeopathic therapies, 'complex homoeopathy', on the basis of a conventional diagnosis. Clinical homoeopathy uses the same remedy in patients presenting with a homogenous pathology or constellation of symptoms. There is no evidence that describes the benefits of one approach compared with another approach. Homoeopathy is practiced on different levels. Many homoeopathic therapies are available over the counter in pharmacies and health food shops. However, homoeopaths require several years of study to achieve their qualification. The trained homoeopath will treat an individual based on a detailed case history and the homoeopathic treatment will be tailored to the individual's constitution.</P>
<P>In recent years the use of alternative and complementary medicine has become popular in many Western countries (<LINK REF="REF-MacLennan-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">MacLennan 2002</LINK>). Unconventional therapies are more common among women of reproductive age, with almost half of all women (49%) reporting that they have used them (<LINK REF="REF-Eisenberg-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eisenberg 1998</LINK>). It is possible that a significant proportion of women are using these therapies during pregnancy. The use of homoeopathy has been applied at the time of conception, pregnancy and labour to treat some of the discomforts and imbalances that can arise during pregnancy such as backache, constipation, morning sickness and heartburn. A recent survey described the prevalence and use of complementary therapies among 82 nurse-midwives in North Carolina (<LINK REF="REF-Allaire-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Allaire 2000</LINK>). Over 30% of nurse-midwives reported recommending homoeopathy for use in pregnancy. Homoeopathy was recommended for use to ripen the cervix, induce labour and to augment labour.</P>
<P>For some women with a prolonged pregnancy, an induction of labour may be perceived to intervene in the natural process of pregnancy and may drastically change their expected plan of care during pregnancy. The reasons why pregnant women are interested in using complementary therapies to ripen the cervix or induce labour, or both, is an important question and needs to be answered when evaluating new options of care. Serious adverse effects from homoeopathy are rare, and remedies recommended for use in pregnancy are not thought to cause any problems in pregnancy.</P>
<P>Caulophyllum thalictroides is proposed to be extremely useful with establishing labour, or when uterine contractions are short and irregular or when uterine contractions stop (<LINK REF="REF-Priestman-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Priestman 1988</LINK>). Some homoeopaths suggest taking one tablet daily for the last few days before labour starts, or alternatively to dissolve a tablet in a glass of water and sip from the glass from time to time, or whenever a contraction is imminent. A non-randomised clinical trial was carried out to examine the efficacy of caulophyllum before birth for the treatment of uterine inertia and reducing the risk of postpartum haemorrhage (<LINK REF="REF-Ventoskovskiy-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ventoskovskiy 1990</LINK>). The authors concluded this remedy has a role in preventing poor contraction patterns.</P>

<P>Perinatal and maternal morbidity and mortality are composite outcomes. This is not an ideal solution because some components are clearly less severe than others. It is possible for one intervention to cause more deaths but less severe morbidity. However, in the context of labour induction at term this is unlikely. All these events will be rare, and a modest change in their incidence will be easier to detect if composite outcomes are presented. Where possible, the incidence of individual components were explored as secondary outcomes (<I>see</I> below).</P>

<DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2010-02-12 15:29:22 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Sonja L  Henderson">
<P>A strategy was developed to deal with the large volume and complexity of trial data relating to labour induction. Many methods have been studied, in many different categories of women undergoing labour induction. Most trials are intervention-driven, comparing two or more methods in various categories of women. Clinicians and parents need the data arranged by category of woman, to be able to choose which method is best for a particular clinical scenario. To extract these data from several hundred trial reports in a single step would be very difficult. We, therefore, developed a two-stage method of data extraction. The initial data extraction is done in a series of reviews arranged by methods of induction of labour, following a standardised methodology.</P>
<P>To avoid duplication of data in the primary reviews, the labour induction methods have been listed in a specific order, from one to 25. Each review includes comparisons between one of the methods (from two to 25) with only those methods above it on the list. Thus, the review of intravenous oxytocin (4) includes only comparisons with intra cervical prostaglandins (3), vaginal prostaglandins (2) or placebo (1). Methods identified in the future will be added to the end of the list. The current list is as follows:</P>

<P>The trials included in the reviews were extracted from an initial set of trials covering all interventions used in induction of labour (<I>see</I> above for details of search strategy). The data extraction process was conducted centrally. This was co-ordinated from the Clinical Effectiveness Support Unit (CESU) at the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, UK, in co-operation with the Pregnancy and Childbirth Group of The Cochrane Collaboration. This process allowed the data extraction process to be standardised across all the reviews.</P>
<P>The trials were initially reviewed on eligibility criteria, using a standardised form and the basic selection criteria specified above. Following this, data were extracted to a standardised data extraction form which was piloted for consistency and completeness. The pilot process involved the researchers at the CESU and previous review authors in the area of induction of labour.</P>
<P>Information was extracted regarding the methodological quality of trials on a number of levels. This process was completed without consideration of trial results. Assessment of selection bias examined the process involved in the generation of the random sequence and the method of allocation concealment separately. These were then judged as adequate or inadequate using the criteria described in <LINK REF="APP-01" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 1</LINK> for the purpose of the reviews.</P>
<P>Performance bias was examined with regards to whom was blinded in the trials, i.e. patient, caregiver, outcome assessor or analyst. In many trials the caregiver, assessor and analyst were the same party. Details of the feasibility and appropriateness of blinding at all levels were sought.</P>
<P>Predefined subgroup analyses are: previous caesarean section or not; nulliparity or multiparity; membranes intact or ruptured, and cervix unfavourable, favourable or undefined. Only those outcomes with data will appear in the analysis tables.</P>
<P>Individual outcome data were included in the analysis if they met the pre stated criteria in <LINK TAG="CRIT_OUTCOMES" TYPE="SECTION">Types of outcome measures</LINK>. Included trial data were processed as described in the Cochrane Reviewers' Handbook (<LINK REF="REF-Clarke-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clarke 2002</LINK>). Data extracted from the trials were analysed on an intention-to-treat basis (when this was not done in the original report, re-analysis is performed if possible). Where data were missing, clarification was sought from the original authors. If the attrition was such that it might significantly affect the results, these data are excluded from the analysis. This decision rests with the review authors of primary reviews and is clearly documented. Once missing data become available, they will be included in the analyses.</P>
<P>Data were extracted from all eligible trials to examine how issues of quality influence effect size in a sensitivity analysis. In trials where reporting was poor, methodological issues were reported as unclear or clarification sought.</P>
<P>Due to the large number of trials, double data extraction was not feasible and agreement between the three data extractors was therefore assessed on a random sample of trials.</P>
<P>Once the data had been extracted, they were distributed to individual review authors for entry onto the Review Manager computer software (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2003</LINK>), checked for accuracy, and analysed as above using the RevMan software. For dichotomous data, risk ratios and 95% confidence intervals were calculated, and in the absence of heterogeneity, results were pooled using a fixed-effect model.</P>
<P>The predefined criteria for sensitivity analysis included all aspects of quality assessment as mentioned above, including aspects of selection, performance and attrition bias. Letters are used to indicate the quality of the included trials as described by <LINK REF="REF-Clarke-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clarke 2002</LINK>. The sensitivity analysis explores the influence of high-quality trials (defined as "A"), versus moderate quality trials (defined as "B"), and high-quality trials (defined as "A") versus low-quality trials (defined as "C"), as well as the effects of analysing by intention to treat on the effect size.</P>
<P>Primary analysis was limited to the prespecified outcomes and subgroup analyses. In the event of differences in unspecified outcomes or sub-groups being found, these were analysed post hoc, but clearly identified as such to avoid drawing unjustified conclusions.</P>

<STUDY_DESCRIPTION MODIFIED="2010-02-17 08:52:50 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Sonja L  Henderson">
<P>Four studies were identified. Two were included and two were excluded. The search strategy identified two randomised controlled trials for inclusion in this review (<LINK REF="STD-Beer-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Beer 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dorfman-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Dorfman 1987</LINK>).</P>
<P>The study by Beer et al (<LINK REF="STD-Beer-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Beer 1999</LINK>) compared caulophyllum in a placebo double blind controlled trial and was undertaken in Germany. The authors of this trial examined the efficacy and tolerability of the homoeopathic remedy caulophyllum D4 in 40 women at term with prelabour rupture of membranes (PROM) at term and not in labour. The trial examined the effect of caulophyllum on the time interval from entry to the onset of regular uterine contractions. Other outcomes examined the effect on the duration of labour, oxytocin requirements, mode of delivery and the rate of maternal and neonatal infection. Women were administered caulophyllum or a placebo hourly for seven hours. Each active tablet consisted of 250 mg caulophyllum trituration D4, a mixture of magnesium stearate and a wheat starch mixture. The placebo contained no active ingredients but contained the magnesium stearate and a wheat starch mixture.</P>
<P>The trial presented information on the baseline characteristics between the two randomised groups. No differences in age, weight, height, cervical score at trial entry and time since PROM were found between study groups.</P>
<P>The study by Dorfman et al (<LINK REF="STD-Dorfman-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Dorfman 1987</LINK>) was undertaken in France. The trial compared five homoeopathic therapies with placebo in 93 women from 36 weeks' pregnant; 53 women were randomised to the treatment group and 40 to the placebo group. The trial examined the effect of the homoeopathic therapy on length of labour and the proportion of women experiencing a difficult labour. No details were provided on the placebo. The groups were comparable with respect to parity.</P>

<STUDY_QUALITY MODIFIED="2010-02-12 15:25:11 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Sonja L  Henderson">
<P>The method of randomisation in both trials was not described and was therefore unclear. Both trials were reported as double blind although there was no information as to whether caregivers and the outcome assessors were blind to the women's group allocation. There were no withdrawals from the trials. The authors of the trials did not state they performed an intention-to-treat analysis, although the studies did analyse outcome data from the same number of women who were reported as having been randomised. The sample size was small in both trials and there was no description of the sample size calculation or if a calculation was undertaken. The information on any side effects arising from caulophyllum was unclear and it was unclear as to how women assessed the tolerability of caulophyllum. No data were provided on side effects from the <LINK REF="STD-Dorfman-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Dorfman 1987</LINK> trial.</P>

<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS MODIFIED="2010-01-14 16:27:45 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two trials involving 133 women were included in the review.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Caulophyllum versus placebo</HEADING>
<P>Forty women with a singleton pregnancy and prelabour rupture of membranes were randomised to caulophyllum or placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Beer-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Beer 1999</LINK>).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Primary outcomes</HEADING>
<P>Vaginal delivery not achieved within 24 hours was reported for one woman in the control group (1/20) and no women in the treatment group (risk ratio (RR) 0.33, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.01 to 7.72). Data on uterine hyperstimulation were not recorded. Two women in the group given caulophyllum had caesarean sections compared with no women in the placebo group (RR 5.0, 95% CI 0.26 to 98.00). No data were presented on fetal heart rate changes although the author describes that slight but not significant differences were noted. No data were reported on serious maternal or neonatal morbidity such as; meconium-stained liquor; Apgar score less than seven at five minutes; neonatal intensive care unit admission; postpartum haemorrhage; or serious maternal complications (e.g. intensive care unit admission, septicaemia).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Secondary outcomes</HEADING>
<P>No data were presented on cervical change, however the author reported minor differences between groups. Oxytocin augmentation was administered to nine women (45%) in each group, no differences were found (RR 1.0, 95% CI 0.50 to 1.98). There was no difference in the rate of instrumental delivery between the two groups (RR 1.0 95%CI 0.54 to 1.86). No differences were found in Apgar scores between groups. Women's and midwives' views on this method were sought and all described the method as tolerable.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Additional data</HEADING>
<P>The difference in the interval between administration of the intervention and regular uterine contractions was 13 hours in the treatment group and 13.4 hours in the control group (mean difference -0.40, 95% CI -7.21 to 6.41).</P>
<P>In the <LINK REF="STD-Dorfman-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Dorfman 1987</LINK> trial only two outcomes were reported. The mean length of labour for women receiving the homoeopathic therapy was 5.1 hours compared with 8.48 hours in the placebo group (P less than 0.001). Data could not be entered into the meta-analysis due to the absence of data on standard deviation. A difficult labour was reported for six women (11.3%) in the treatment group and 16 (40%) in the placebo group (RR 0.28, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.66). Mode of delivery was not reported by study group.</P>

</INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>This review included two trials. There were no differences seen in any of the primary outcome measures described in this review. Unfortunately, the quality of the trials was difficult to assess because of insufficient detail in the research papers, and the small sample sizes provide inadequate power. </P>
<P>There is little research to assess the effectiveness of remedies in stimulating the onset of labour. The lack of data in this area is compounded by a lack of relevant clinical outcome data which could be included into this review. The use of caulophyllum may not represent common homoeopathic practice, where the prescribing of a therapy would be more individualised.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>There is insufficient evidence to recommend the use of any homoeopathic therapies as a method of induction of labour. </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Given that some women are likely to continue to seek homoeopathic therapies for induction of labour, there is a need for rigorous, adequately powered trials that assess clinically meaningful outcomes. Such trials should include assessment of uterine hyperstimulation as well as indicators of maternal and neonatal morbidity. Further research using classical homoeopathy might be more relevant to assessing both the effectiveness and safety of homoeopathy.</P>
