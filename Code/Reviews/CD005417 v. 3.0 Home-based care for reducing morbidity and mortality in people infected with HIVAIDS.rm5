<P>Home-based care (HBC), to promote quality-of-life and limit hospital care, is used in many countries, especially where public health services are overburdened. The objectives of this review was to assess the effects of HBC on morbidity and mortality in those with HIV/AIDS. A comprehensive search for clinical trials of HBC including all forms of treatment, care and support offered in the home was done. Eleven completed and two ongoing studies were identified. Studies were generally small and very few studies were done in developing countries. There was a lack of studies truly looking at the effect of home based care itself or looking at significant end points (death and progression to AIDS). Intensive home-based nursing significantly improved self-reported knowledge of HIV and medications, and self-reported adherence to medication. Another study, comparing proportion of participants with greater than 90% adherence, found statistically significant differences over time but no significant change in CD4 counts and viral loads. A third study found significant differences in HIV stigma, worry and physical functioning but no differences in depressive symptoms, mood, general health, and overall functioning. Comprehensive case management by trans-professional teams compared to usual care by primary care nurses had no significant difference in quality-of-life after 6-months of follow-up and average length of time on service. Home total parenteral nutrition had no significant impact on overall survival and rate of re-hospitalisation. Two trials comparing computers with brochures/nothing/standard medical care found no significant effect on health status, and decision-making confidence and skill, but a reduction in social isolation after controlling for depression. Two trials evaluating home exercise programmes found opposing results. Home-based safe water systems reduced diarrhea frequency and severity among persons with HIV in Africa.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2009-11-11 15:20:19 -0800" MODIFIED_BY="Tara Horvath">
<P>Along with tuberculosis and malaria, HIV/AIDS is the major cause of illness and death in low and middle-income countries where health services already struggle with limited resources (staff, drugs, equipment, etc) and poor infrastructure (<LINK REF="REF-UNAIDS-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">UNAIDS 2004</LINK>). Thirty three million people are living with HIV and in 2007, an estimated 2.5 million people became newly infected with HIV/AIDS and 2.1 million people died (<LINK REF="REF-UNAIDS-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">UNAIDS 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>Comprehensive management and control strategies for HIV/AIDS include prevention, treatment, care and support. The treatment required varies as the clinical stage of the disease progresses (<LINK REF="REF-Morrison-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morrison 1993</LINK>). Despite the availability of antiretroviral treatment, hospital admissions related to HIV/AIDS care still accounts for a big proportion of the expenditures for people with AIDS (, <LINK REF="REF-Floyd-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Floyd 2001</LINK>). As a result, home-based care (HBC) is increasingly being used as a key management strategy in many countries, especially where the public health services are already overburdened with limited human and financial resources.</P>
<P>Home-based care (HBC) has been defined by the Committee on a National Strategy for AIDS (CNSA) for the United States of America as care at the patients' residence to supplement or replace hospital care including medical management, palliative care and social support (<LINK REF="REF-Uys-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Uys 2003</LINK>). A similar definition is used by the World Health Organisation where community HBC is defined as any form of care given to ill people in their homes (WHO 2002) WHO . This include physical, psychosocial, palliative and spiritual activities with the goal to provide hope through high-quality and appropriate care that helps ill people and<BR/>families to maintain their independence and achieve the best possible quality of life. </P>
<P>There are various models of home-based care: integrated HBC where all service providers are involved, single service HBC involving one organisation, and the informal HBC model with no formal support structure (<LINK REF="REF-Uys-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Uys 2003</LINK>). The care offered can include counselling and teaching, palliative care, increasing the health of the patient with symptom control and lightening the care load. It has also been proposed to offer home based care for all diseases and thus move away from a disease-specific approach aiming to reduce the stigma associated with HIV/AIDS (<LINK REF="REF-Havens-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Havens 1999</LINK>). With the roll out of antiretroviral treatment programmes there is also a need for some diversification in how the activity is viewed in terms of community-based workers doubling as treatment supporters.</P>
<P>Cited benefits of HBC include lower costs (direct and opportunity costs) at both individual and country level, personalised care, being in familiar surroundings, culturally appropriate care and increasing the time family members have for other responsibilities. It is also said to reduce the pressure on hospital beds and to increase effective time use in hospitals (<LINK REF="REF-Afroaidsinfo" TYPE="REFERENCE">Afroaidsinfo</LINK>).</P>
<P>So far resources have been committed to implementing this strategy with the focus placed on cost assessment. However, its effectiveness has not been assessed (<LINK REF="REF-Hansen-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hansen 1998</LINK>). Cost-effectiveness has been demonstrated for home care substituting for acute care but less frequently where home care substitutes for long-term institutionalization. Research questions raised include the impact of HBC on the community, stigma, cost, hospital bed occupancy and the effectiveness of HBC (<LINK REF="REF-Uys-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Uys 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>Assessing the quality of health care is difficult in any setting and particularly complex where care is delivered at home (<LINK REF="REF-NNRA-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">NNRA 1994</LINK>). The need has been identified to assess the quality of home care in a systematic manner (<LINK REF="REF-NNRA-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">NNRA 1994</LINK>) documenting the process of care delivery as well as the outcomes of this care. A number of reviews have examined the effectiveness of home care. <LINK REF="REF-Hedrick-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hedrick 1989</LINK> reviewed 13 studies on the effects of home care on mortality and nursing-home placements. The analysis demonstrated a small beneficial, but statistically insignificant, effect of home care on mortality and nursing-home placements. Similarly, <LINK REF="REF-Elkan-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elkan 2001</LINK> found that home visits to older people can reduce mortality and admission to long term institutional care. <LINK REF="REF-Hughes-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hughes 1997</LINK> examined the impact of home care on hospital days. The effect on the reduction of hospital days tended to be larger in studies with terminally-ill patients, with quasi-experimental designs, and when the impact was measured at six months or less versus measuring impact at greater than six months. In contrast, <LINK REF="REF-Smeenk-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smeenk 1998</LINK> concluded that the effectiveness of home care programmes for patients with terminal cancer remains unclear.</P>
<P>No systematic review has assessed the impact of HIV/AIDS home care. In considering this approach the evidence of its effectiveness needs to be evaluated as an essential first step.</P>

<SEARCH_METHODS MODIFIED="2008-11-18 03:00:16 -0800" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>To identify studies both electronic and manual searches were done.</P>
<P>
<B>Electronic searches</B>
<BR/>The following electronic databases were searched from 1980 to June 2005: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, AIDSearch, CINAHL, PsycINFO/LIT. An updated search was performed in March 2007 for the period July 2005 to March 2007, and again in September 2008 for the period April 2007 to September 2008, in CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE and AIDSearch.</P>
<P>Detailed search strategies were compiled for each database searched (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK> details the MEDLINE search strategy). This was based on the Cochrane HIV/AIDS Review Group comprehensive search strategy which included phases 1, 2 and 3 of the Cochrane Highly Sensitive Search Strategy for Randomised Controlled Trials as published in Appendix 5b2 of the Cochrane Reviewers' Handbook<I> </I>(<LINK REF="REF-Alderson-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alderson 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>Clinicaltrials.gov and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Plarform were searched to identify ongoing trials.<B>
<I>
<BR/>
</I>
<BR/>Manual searches</B>
<BR/>The strategy was iterative, in that references of included studies were searched for additional references.Due to lack of access, handsearching was not performed of abstracts of the International Conference on HIV/AIDS in Africa (ICASA).</P>
<P>All languages were included.</P>
</SEARCH_METHODS>
<DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2009-11-11 15:20:19 -0800" MODIFIED_BY="Tara Horvath">
<P>1. Selection of studies<BR/>Titles, abstracts and descriptor terms of the electronic search results were screened independently by two authors (TY and KB) for relevance based on the types of participants, interventions, and study design specified in the criteria for selecting studies for the review. Full text articles were obtained of all selected abstracts and an eligibility form was used to determine final study selection. Differences were resolved by discussions with the review mentor.</P>
<P>2. Risk of bias<BR/>The risk of bias of included studies was evaluated independently by the two authors (TY and KB).<BR/>a) The likelihood of selection bias was assessed by evaluating the method of allocation sequence generation and the adequacy of allocation concealment.<BR/>b) Performance bias was assessed by establishing if any additional interventions happened as well as looking at the presence or absence of blinding.<BR/>c) Detection bias was assessed by evaluating the method of outcome assessment and whether the same method of ascertainment was used in both groups as well as assessing blinding.<BR/>d) Attrition bias was assessed by looking at the follow up to see if at least 80% of participants in all groups were included in the final analysis and also if the description of those not included is suggestive of bias.</P>
<P>3. Data extraction<BR/>Data was extracted independently by 2 authors (TY and KB) using a standardised data extraction form. Any disagreements were adjudicated by the review mentor. The following information was gathered from each included study:<BR/>Administrative details - Identification; author(s); published or unpublished; year of publication; year in which study was conducted; details of other relevant papers cited<BR/>Details of study - study design; method(s) of recruitment; inclusion and exclusion criteria; number of participants assessed for eligibility, number excluded, number enrolled, number analysed; type, duration, frequency and completeness of follow-up; country and location of the study; setting in which the study was performed (e.g. urban or rural); number of participants, characteristics of participants - age; education; socio-economic status.<BR/>Details of intervention - type of home-based care offered; by whom; frequency; etc<BR/>Details of outcomes - primary and secondary outcomes; effectiveness of intervention studied<BR/>Details of study ethics - informed consent obtained for participation; approving institution(s)</P>
<P>Missing or inadequate data were addressed by contacting authors.</P>
<P>4. Data analysis
<BR/>
Narrative synthesis of results were done. Relevant effect measures and the 95% confidence intervals (CI) were reported. In <LINK REF="STD-Lule-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Lule 2005</LINK>, generalized estimating equation methods with an exchangeable correlation structure and an offset for the number of days at risk were used to control for intra-household and intra-individual disease clustering.</P>
<P>No meta-analysis was performed. In future updates, if possible, a meta-analysis will be undertaken to measure the appropriate measure of effect and 95% CI. Heterogeneity will be explored and if significant, subgroup analysis will be done for different type of carers, different models of home-based care and baseline disease stage i.e. WHO stages 1or 2, which correlates with CD4 greater than 200, versus WHO stages 3 or 4 correlating with CD4 less than 200 (<LINK REF="REF-French-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">French 1999</LINK>).</P>

<P>
<B>1. Home based intensive nursing vs. standard care</B>

<BR/>

<BR/>1.1 Two studies, one in adults (<LINK REF="STD-Williams-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Williams 2006</LINK>) and one in children (<LINK REF="STD-Berrien-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Berrien 2004</LINK>), examined the effects of an intensive nursing programme compared to standard care on patients knowledge of HIV and related medication, adherence, viral load and CD4 counts.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Berrien-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Berrien 2004</LINK> offered eight structured home visits over a 3-month period by the same home care experienced registered nurse. The intervention was designed to improve knowledge and understanding of HIV infection and HIV medications and to resolve or modify barriers to adherence. Standard care, in the clinic setting, included the physician, nurse, and social worker providing standard medication adherence education. The intensive home based nursing intervention significantly improved self reported patient knowledge of HIV and medications when comparing both post test scores (n= 37, WMD 2.5, 95%CI 2.14 to 2.86, <LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>), and change scores (n=37, WMD 2.8, 95%CI 2.23 to 3.37, <LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>). Self reported adherence to medication was significantly different (n=37, WMD 2.9, 95%CI 2.39 to 3.41, <LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>) as well as the difference in pharmacy drug refill (reported p=0.002). There were no significant differences in CD4 counts or viral loads.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Williams-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Williams 2006</LINK> (n=171) examined the effects of an adherence intervention which included social and educational components. Adherence was measured as the ratio of the number of recorded Medication Event Monitoring Systems cap (MEMS cap) openings to the number of openings to be expected if the medication were taken as prescribed. The median CD4 counts were 345 and 341 for the intervention and control arms respectively. Comparing the proportion of participants with greater than 90% adherence, there was a statistically significant difference between the two arms over time (reported extended Mantel-Haensel test 5.80, p=0.02). There was no significant change in CD4 counts and viral loads.</P>
<P>1.2 One study (<LINK REF="STD-Miles-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Miles 2003</LINK>) assessed the impact on emotional distress (depression, stigma, worry) and health related quality of life.</P>
<P>The intervention was conducted by three nurses in the homes of African American women with HIV who were primary caregivers for at least one child under the age of nine years. The content and process for each visit involved four phases. The intervention was embedded in a therapeutic relationship between the mother and the nurse. Relationship strategies included (a) accepting the woman and her family, (b) valuing her perspectives about the management of her illness, (c) listening to and reflecting feelings, and (d) reinforcing the steps the woman took to improve her life and the lives of her family. A semi-structured clinical interview based on the goals of the intervention was used, but was driven by the mother's specific concerns and needs. The control group received usual care that involved health visits for primary care and specialty visits for HIV related care, although most of the women got all their care at the tertiary care HIV clinics. At these clinics, the focus of care was on health problems rather than self-care symptom management. Both clinics did offer assistance with social problems and transportation.</P>
<P>Considering the scores at 6 months (n=109) there was a statistically significant difference in HIV stigma (WMD -0.25, 95%CI -0.49 to -0.01), HIV worry (WMD -0.46, 95%CI -0.89 to -0.03) and physical functioning (WMD 1.45, 95%CI 0.01 to 2.89). No statistically significant difference was found for depressive symptoms, mood, general health, and overall functioning.</P>
<P>
<B>2. Trans-professional team vs. independent primary nurse</B>

<BR/>

<BR/>2.1 <LINK REF="STD-Nickel-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Nickel 1996</LINK> assessed quality of life and survival.</P>
<P>Comprehensive case management by a trans-professional team, as detailed in the table of included studies, was compared with usual care by the primary care nurse. After 6 months of follow-up (n=57) there were no significant differences in quality of life scores or the survival curves.</P>
<P>2.2 <LINK REF="STD-Cherin-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Cherin 1998</LINK> assessed the time in program and cost</P>
<P>An interdisciplinary team care management approach including curative as well as palliative care were compared to independent services primarily nurse driven with the focus on curative rather than palliative care. There was no significant difference in average length of time on service (n=549).<BR/>
</P>
<P>
<B>3. Computer vs. brochures/nothing/standard medical care<BR/>
</B>

<BR/>
Three studies evaluated perceived social isolation, decision making confidence, health status, quality of life, risk behaviors, health service utilization, and Comprehensive Health Enhancement Support System (CHESS) usage.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Flatley_x002d_Brennan-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Flatley-Brennan 1998</LINK> (n=57) provided information, communication and decision support via a computer in the homes of people living with AIDS and compared it with printed brochures and monthly telephone calls. There were no significant effect on health status, and decision making confidence and skill. There was a reduction in social isolation if controlling for depression.<BR/>
<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Gustafson-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Gustafson 1999</LINK> (n=204) installed the CHESS for 3-6 months in the home and compared it to no intervention. With regard to quality of life there were increased cognitive functioning, sense of social support, more active life, and reduced negative emotions. There was no significant difference in depression, physical functioning and level of energy. Also no significant change in sex risk behavior. At 6 months there were increased attitudes toward risk behavior and toward disclosure of HIV status. Related to health service utilization there were no significant change in number of out patient visits but a reduced time spent with providers as well as a significantly reduced probability of admission.<BR/>
<BR/>
<B>4. Exercise<BR/>
</B>
<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Baigis-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Baigis 2002</LINK> (n=123) compared 20 minute work out on a fitness master ski machine brought by a nurse or trainer three times per week to a 30 minute visit per week over 15 weeks. They found no significant difference in physical endurance, immune status, and self reported physical functioning and well being between the two groups.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Dolan-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Dolan 2006</LINK> (n=40) compared a supervised home-based progressive resistance training and aerobic exercise program to no intervention over 16 weeks. In both groups more than 80% of participants were receiving antiretroviral therapy. The change in VO<SUB>2</SUB>max at 16 weeks was significant (1.5±0.8 vs -2.5±1.6 mL/kg/min; p&lt;0.001). Strength measured by change in 1-repitition maximum increased significantly at the knee extensors, pectoralis, knee flexors, shoulder abductors, ankle plantar flexors, elbow flexors (right), and elbow flexors (left). Body mass index, abdominal and total fat did not change between groups. Waist circumference decreased more in the exercise-treated group than in the control group (&#8722;1.0±0.6 vs 1.5±1.0 cm; p=0.03). No significant difference was seen in lipid levels, glucose, CD4 count, viral load, or blood pressure. Eighty nine percent of the exercise group compared to 16% of the control group self-reported a change in their cardiovascular health in the past 4 months. Dietary intake of total calories, fat, carbohydrate, and protein did not differ over time between the treatment groups.</P>
<P>
<B>5. Two months home total parenteral nutrition vs. dietary counselling<BR/>
</B>
<BR/>One study (<LINK REF="STD-Melchoir-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Melchoir 1996</LINK>) n=31 examined the effect of home total parenteral nutrition (TPN) via central venous line by cyclic nocturnal administration 6 days weekly with that of oral dietetic supplements and vitamins. There was a significant change in lean body mass and body cell mass. The nutritional subjective global assessment, and subjective health feeling and functioning (as measured by the Karnofsky index) were also improved by TPN. Overall survival and rate of re-hospitalisation were not significantly different. No TPN related severe complications were observed.</P>
<P>
<B>6. Home-based water chlorination and safe storage</B>
</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Lule-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Lule 2005</LINK> compared the effect of home-based water chlorination and safe storage and education to education only in a cluster RCT. Among those with HIV, the intervention was associated with a 25% reduction in diarrhea episodes (adjusted rate ratio 0.75; 95% CI 0.59 to 0.94) and 33% fewer days with diarrhea (adjusted rate ratio 0.67; 95% CI 0.48 to 0.94).</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2009-04-02 03:05:00 -0700" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Intensive home-based nursing significantly improved self-reported knowledge of HIV and medications, self-reported adherence and difference in pharmacy drug refill (1 study). Another study, comparing proportion of participants with greater than 90% adherence, found statistically significant differences over time but no significant change in CD4 counts and viral loads. A third study found significant differences in HIV stigma, worry and physical functioning but no differences in depressive symptoms, mood, general health, and overall functioning. Comprehensive case management by trans-professional teams compared to usual care by primary care nurses had no significant difference in quality-of-life after 6-months of follow-up (n=57) and average length of time on service (n=549). Home total parenteral nutrition had no significant impact on overall survival and rate of re-hospitalisation. Two trials comparing computers with brochures/nothing/standard medical care found no significant effect on health status, and decision-making confidence and skill, but a reduction in social isolation after controlling for depression. Two studies evaluating home exercise programmes found opposing results. Home-based safe water systems reduced diarrhea frequency and severity among persons with HIV in Africa.<BR/>

<P>Any RCT investigating the effect of home-based care, provided by family, lay and/or professional people, including all forms of treatment, care and support offered in the HIV/AIDS positive person's home as compared to hospital or institutional based care were eligible for inclusion in this review. Care offered in outreach settings other than the home was not included. Eleven completed and two ongoing studies investigating a range of interventions were included. Studies were generally small and very few studies were done in developing countries. None of the studies addressed the primary outcomes (death and progression to AIDS) stated in protocol. Furthermore, comparisons included studies comparing either two different approaches to delivering care or single interventions compared to no intervention or a control, whereas the protocol originally stated that the studies should be of an intervention versus hospital or institutional care. The review did not include outcomes related to the carers or family. </P>
<P>As a result, the conclusions which can be drawn from this review are limited. Furthermore, the evidence base of how home-based care fits into the current treatment context, especially in low resource countries, need further development.</P>

<P>The results indicate that intensive home-based nursing significantly improved self-reported knowledge of HIV and medications, self-reported adherence and difference in pharmacy drug refill. It also significantly impacted on HIV stigma, worry and physical functioning but not depressive symptoms, mood, general health, and overall functioning. Comprehensive case management by trans-professional teams and that provided by primary care nurses had the same impact in the short term. Home-based safe water systems reduced diarrhea frequency and severity among persons with HIV in Africa. Considerations for practice should recognise that none of the included studies evaluated death or progression to AIDS. </P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2009-11-11 15:20:19 -0800" MODIFIED_BY="Tara Horvath">
<P>Studies were generally small and very few studies were done in developing countries. There was a lack of studies truly looking at the effect of home based care itself or looking at significant end points (death and progression to AIDS). Further large studies should therefore focus on evaluating these significant end points, on feasible interventions for developing countries and on how home-based care fits into the current treatment context.</P>

<P>Intervention: Subjects randomized to exercise training were seen in their homes by a member of the study staff 3 times a week, on alternating days, for 16 weeks (48 sessions, 2 hours per session, with makeup sessions scheduled for missed sessions). Required exercise equipment for home use was provided to each subject randomized to the exercise regimen. Equipment included an upright stationary bicycle, a flexion-extension bench, a free-standing squat stand, weight sets, and a heart monitor. Each training session began with a 5-minute warm-up on a stationary bicycle at 50% of estimated maximal heart rate (maximal heart rate = 220 &#8722; age), followed by a standard flexibility routine to minimize the risk of injury. Subsequently, the supervised aerobic and strength training protocol was performed, followed by a cool-down period.</P>

<P>Intervention: conducted in the homes of the women by three nurses. The content and process for each visit involved four phases. Intervention was embedded in a therapeutic relationship between the mother and the nurse. Relationship strategies included (a) accepting the woman and her family, (b) valuing her perspectives about the management of her illness, (c) listening to and reflecting feelings, and (d) reinforcing the steps the woman took to improve her life and the lives of her family. A semi-structured clinical interview based on the goals of the intervention was used, but was driven by the mother's specific concerns and needs.</P>
<P>Control: received usual care that involved health visits for primary care and specialty visits for HIV related care, although most of the women got all their care at the tertiary care HIV clinics. At these clinics, the focus of care was on health problems rather than self-care symptom management. Both clinics did offer assistance with social problems and transportation.</P>

<P>Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale was used to assess depressive symptoms. Profile of Mood States was used to assess mood or general affective state. Stigma was measured using the Demi HIV Stigma Scale. The HIV Worry Scale was designed to assess distress related to worry regarding HIV. Besides the latter scale, all the others had good validity. The number of infections was derived from self-report using a Health Questionnaire (number of infections experienced over past 3 months; specific types of infections were listed). The Medical Outcomes Survey-HIV measured aspects of health quality of life including perception of health, physical function, energy, health distress, and role function.</P>
