<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2012-08-13 10:49:42 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Dermatomyositis and polymyositis are long-term inflammatory muscle diseases, causing muscle weakness and disability. For some reason, the body's immune system turns against its own muscles in an autoimmune response. Corticosteroids are the principal treatment but due to side effects, there is a need for additional treatment with drugs that suppress the immune system (immunosuppressants) or modify it (immunomodulatory therapies) to improve patient outcomes. For this review, an update of a review first published in 2005, we found ten randomised trials available, involving 258 participants.</P>
<P>Amongst the six studies comparing immunosuppressant with placebo, one study, investigating intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg), showed statistically significant improvement in scores of muscle strength in the IVIg group over three months. Another study investigating etanercept showed some evidence of a longer median time to relapse in the etanercept group, a secondary outcome in this review, but no improvement in other assessed outcomes. The other four randomised placebo-controlled trials assessed either plasma exchange and leukapheresis, eculizumab, infliximab or azathioprine against placebo and all produced negative results.</P>
<P>Three of the four studies comparing two immunosuppressant regimes (azathioprine with methotrexate, ciclosporin with methotrexate, and intramuscular methotrexate with oral methotrexate plus azathioprine) showed no statistically significant difference in efficacy between the treatment regimes. The fourth study comparing pulsed oral dexamethasone with daily oral prednisolone and found that the dexamethasone regime had a shorter median time to relapse but fewer side effects.</P>
<P>Most of the studies were small (the largest had 62 participants) and many of the reports contained insufficient information to assess risk of bias. Immunosuppressants were associated with significant side effects. The small number of RCTs of immunosuppressants and immunomodulatory therapies are inadequate to decide whether these agents are beneficial in dermatomyositis and polymyositis. Two small trials, one of IVIg in dermatomyositis, the other of etanercept in dermatomyositis suggested that they are beneficial. More RCTs are needed.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2012-07-10 11:47:12 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Ruth Brassington">
<P>The inflammatory myopathies include recognised causes of muscle inflammation such as those due to infection by bacteria, viruses and parasites. Idiopathic inflammatory myopathies refer to diseases in which muscle inflammation occurs without a recognised infective cause and these include dermatomyositis and polymyositis. Such diseases are thought to result from an auto-immune process. Dermatomyositis and polymyositis are characterised by chronic inflammation of skeletal muscle which can result in persisting muscle weakness with significant disability (<LINK REF="REF-Dalakas-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dalakas 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Dalakas-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dalakas 2001</LINK>). They may both occur in association with gastrointestinal, pulmonary and cardiac dysfunction, while only dermatomyositis has skin involvement. The prevalence of idiopathic inflammatory myositis is approximately 11 per 100,000 (<LINK REF="REF-Ahlstrom-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ahlstrom 1993</LINK>). As idiopathic inflammatory myositis is uncommon, optimal therapy has not been adequately defined (<LINK REF="REF-Choy-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Choy 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>Corticosteroids are the principal treatment. Both high- and low-dose corticosteroid regimes are used. In many people, long-term high dose corticosteroids are necessary to control disease and, in a few people, myositis may be refractory to steroid treatment. Therefore, many people with an idiopathic inflammatory myopathy suffer from the side effects of corticosteroids. The mortality and morbidity of inflammatory myositis remains high despite such treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Carpenter-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carpenter 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Joffe-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Joffe 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Riddoch-1975" TYPE="REFERENCE">Riddoch 1975</LINK>). Thus, there is a frequent need to use additional treatment both to improve the disease response and to reduce the side effects of corticosteroids.</P>
<P>Immunosuppressive agents, especially azathioprine, methotrexate, mycophenolate mofetil and ciclosporin, are commonly used in autoimmune diseases as well as in transplant rejection and chronic inflammatory diseases. They are usually employed as second-line therapy to corticosteroids for disease refractory to steroid treatment alone. They can also be used as adjuvants to steroid treatment to allow reduction in the dosage of corticosteroids and thereby decrease the risk of long-term complications. While these treatments are in use for dermatomyositis and polymyositis, the optimal therapeutic regimen remains unclear (<LINK REF="REF-Choy-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Choy 2002</LINK>). Biological agents, in particular the anti-TNF agents and the B-cell depleting agent rituximab, are also presently being assessed as potential therapeutic agents in the inflammatory myopathies.</P>
<P>An alternative approach to improving the treatment of dermatomyositis and polymyositis is the use of immunomodulatory therapy. This includes interferon, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) and plasma exchange which have proven efficacy in various autoimmune disorders. They are gaining attention as possible second-line treatment for polymyositis and dermatomyositis (<LINK REF="REF-Choy-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Choy 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Dalakas-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dalakas 2001</LINK>).</P>

<P>Two review authors (JH and PG) independently assessed the risk of bias for each trial using the domain based 'Risk of bias' tool described in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> 5.1.0 (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). In one trial JH was an author and therefore PG and JW independently assessed the risk of bias in this study.</P>
<P>We assessed the risk of bias as high, low or unclear based on the following questions, each representing a domain.</P>
<P>&#8226; Was the allocation sequence adequately generated?<BR/>&#8226; Was allocation adequately concealed?<BR/>&#8226; Was knowledge of the allocated intervention adequately prevented during the study?<BR/>&#8226; Were incomplete outcome data adequately addressed?<BR/>&#8226; Are reports of the study free of suggestion of selective outcome reporting?<BR/>&#8226; Was the study apparently free of other problems that could put it at a high risk of bias?</P>
<P>We then used the results to create the 'Risk of bias' tables presented in this review. Where the two review authors (JH and PG or PG and JW) could not agree on an domain, this was settled by a third author (JW or JH).</P>

<P>Improvement in MMT by 15% or more was used as a defined outcome in one study (<LINK REF="STD-Coyle-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Coyle 2008</LINK>) and could be inferred from another (<LINK REF="STD-Dalakas-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Dalakas 1993</LINK>).</P>
<P>Assessment of muscle strength was done by MMT in eight of the selected trials. Two used the standard six point MRC scale, (<LINK REF="STD-Miller-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Villalba-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Villalba 1998</LINK>), one the five point MRC scale (<LINK REF="STD-Van-de-Vlekkert--2010" TYPE="STUDY">Van de Vlekkert 2010</LINK>) and two expanded MRC scales, one an eight point scale (<LINK REF="STD-Dalakas-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Dalakas 1993</LINK>) and one an expanded 13 point scale (<LINK REF="STD-Muscle-Study-Group-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Muscle Study Group 2011</LINK>). One study used a non-standard scale (with 0 being normal and -4 being no movement) (<LINK REF="STD-Bunch-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Bunch 1980</LINK>). Two, published in abstract form only, did not define the MMT scale used (<LINK REF="STD-Coyle-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Coyle 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Takada-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Takada 2002</LINK>). The studies also varied in the number of muscle groups assessed. One used 26 muscle groups (<LINK REF="STD-Muscle-Study-Group-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Muscle Study Group 2011</LINK>), two used 18 muscle groups (<LINK REF="STD-Bunch-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Bunch 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dalakas-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Dalakas 1993</LINK>), two used 16 muscle groups (<LINK REF="STD-Miller-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Villalba-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Villalba 1998</LINK>) but one of these did not specify the muscle groups used (<LINK REF="STD-Miller-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 1992</LINK>) and one used 15 muscle groups (<LINK REF="STD-Van-de-Vlekkert--2010" TYPE="STUDY">Van de Vlekkert 2010</LINK>). Two published in abstract form only did not include the number of muscle groups used (<LINK REF="STD-Coyle-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Coyle 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Takada-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Takada 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>In the majority of studies the MMT results were expressed as a sum score, this being the addition of all the scores from all the muscles tested, and maximum sum scores were therefore 80 (<LINK REF="STD-Miller-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Villalba-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Villalba 1998</LINK>), 90 (<LINK REF="STD-Dalakas-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Dalakas 1993</LINK>), and 140 (<LINK REF="STD-Van-de-Vlekkert--2010" TYPE="STUDY">Van de Vlekkert 2010</LINK>). The maximum sum score for one non-standard strength scale was not given (<LINK REF="STD-Bunch-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Bunch 1980</LINK>) and another quoted a maximum score of 160 (<LINK REF="STD-Coyle-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Coyle 2008</LINK>). One study reported the mean manual muscle strength of all the muscles tested (<LINK REF="STD-Muscle-Study-Group-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Muscle Study Group 2011</LINK>). One trial assessed muscle endurance using repetitive testing with a 1 kg weight on a range of muscle groups that were stated. The maximum score in this test was 56 but it was not stated how this score was obtained (<LINK REF="STD-Vencovsky-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Vencovsky 2000</LINK>). One trial used myometry of nine muscle groups and hand grip measurements to assess muscle strength (<LINK REF="STD-Miller-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>The IMACS definition of improvement was used as an outcome in two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Coyle-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Coyle 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Muscle-Study-Group-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Muscle Study Group 2011</LINK>), in a modified form in one case (<LINK REF="STD-Muscle-Study-Group-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Muscle Study Group 2011</LINK>).</P>

<P>The number of participants in remission and time-to-remission was an outcome measure in one study, which compared dexamethasone therapy to prednisolone therapy (<LINK REF="STD-Van-de-Vlekkert--2010" TYPE="STUDY">Van de Vlekkert 2010</LINK>).</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2012-07-10 11:49:45 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This systematic review highlights the lack of high quality RCTs that assess the efficacy and toxicity of immunosuppressants in inflammatory myositis. Ten trials were included in the review with only one agent, IVIg demonstrating statistically significant superior efficacy against control, and a second agent, etanercept showing a possible steroid-sparing effect. Therefore, we have to conclude that there is insufficient evidence from available RCTs to confirm the value of immunosuppressants in inflammatory myositis. For 'Summary of findings' tables see <LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK>; <LINK REF="TBL-04" TYPE="TABLE">Table 4</LINK>; <LINK REF="TBL-05" TYPE="TABLE">Table 5</LINK>; <LINK REF="TBL-06" TYPE="TABLE">Table 6</LINK>; <LINK REF="TBL-07" TYPE="TABLE">Table 7</LINK>; <LINK REF="TBL-08" TYPE="TABLE">Table 8</LINK>; <LINK REF="TBL-09" TYPE="TABLE">Table 9</LINK>; <LINK REF="TBL-10" TYPE="TABLE">Table 10</LINK>; <LINK REF="TBL-11" TYPE="TABLE">Table 11</LINK>; and <LINK REF="TBL-12" TYPE="TABLE">Table 12</LINK>.</P>
<P>This conclusion appears to contradict the experience of many clinicians. However, the lack of good evidence is not the same as no evidence. The lack of RCTs in inflammatory myositis is typical of the problem faced by evidence-based medicine. Conducting high quality RCTs in rare diseases is extremely difficult. Yet without data from high quality RCTs, it is impossible for clinicians to assess the benefit/risk ratio of immunosuppressants in myositis accurately. The trial of plasma exchange and leukapheresis is a good example of where a treatment is ineffective but has significant side effects. Indeed, this review found that immunosuppressants are associated with significant side effects. Clearly, it is important for physicians and participants to appreciate the precise benefit and risk of immunosuppressants in inflammatory myositis. Participants with inflammatory myositis are managed by different specialists: neurologists, rheumatologists, dermatologists or general physicians. Since high quality RCTs require sufficient sample sizes to deliver the necessary statistical power, individual clinicians rarely have a sufficient number of potential participants under their care to conduct trials. Therefore, multicentre trials with collaboration between all these specialists are the only means to study this rare disease. In recent years new collaborative efforts such as the International Myositis Assessment and Clinical Studies Group (IMACS), the European Myositis Network (EUMYONET) and the United Kingdom Myositis Network (UK MYONET) have formed to foster such collaboration.</P>
<P>Another major obstacle in evidence-based medicine in inflammatory myositis has been the lack of international consensus on outcome measures and how data should be presented in publications. However, in recent years the International Myositis Assessment and Clinical Studies Group (IMACS) has developed international multidisciplinary outcome measures (<LINK REF="REF-Isenberg-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Isenberg 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Oddis-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oddis 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rider-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rider 2004</LINK>). These include the 'definitions of improvement' which comprise six core set measures among five domains (<LINK REF="REF-Oddis-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oddis 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rider-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rider 2004</LINK>). These core set measures are: the physician global disease activity, parent/patient global disease activity, muscle strength (MMT), physical function assessment, laboratory assessment and extramuscular disease complications. Improvement is defined as occurring if three of any six core set measures improve by 20%, with no more than two worsening by 25% (measures that worsen cannot include manual muscle strength).</P>
<P>Most of the studies included in this review used the Bohan and Peters diagnostic criteria (<LINK REF="REF-Bohan-1975-a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bohan 1975 a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bohan-1975-b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bohan 1975 b</LINK>) which were published well over thirty years ago. An international workshop on clinical trials in inflammatory myositis highlighted the deficiency of the Bohan and Peters criteria in the diagnosis of polymyositis (<LINK REF="REF-Hoogendijk-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hoogendijk 2004</LINK>). Many of these participants in fact had diagnoses other than polymyositis, especially inclusion body myositis and occasionally dystrophies with associated inflammatory features.</P>
<P>In the absence of adequate RCTs to address the question of which immunosuppressant treatment might be best to use in these inflammatory myopathies, it would be reasonable to look at any non-randomised trials that might help. However, <LINK REF="REF-Van-de-Vlekkert-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van de Vlekkert 2004</LINK> undertook a MEDLINE and EMBASE search from 1966 to 2001 for French, German, or English reports of treatment in dermatomyositis and polymyositis. They found 92 eligible papers describing a total of 915 participants (92 of whom were duplicated) in 74 single case reports and 18 case series. These reports were reviewed for 10 standards that were thought important to allow any reader to recognise their own participant, copy the treatment and have some idea of the treatment effect. The authors concluded that the majority of the reports were of dubious quality and thus a meaningful systematic review of case reports was unrealistic.</P>

<P>The small number of randomised trials of immunosuppressants and immunomodulatory therapies are inadequate to decide whether these agents are beneficial in dermatomyositis and polymyositis. Two small trials in dermatomyositis one of intravenous immunoglobulin and one of etancercept suggest that these agents may be beneficial.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>More research is needed to investigate the efficacy of immunosuppressant and immunomodulatory agents in dermatomyositis and polymyositis.</P>
