<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2012-12-04 16:08:52 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Cardiovascular disease (CVD), which comprises heart attacks (myocardial infarction), angina and strokes, is ranked as the number one cause of mortality and is a major cause of morbidity world wide. High blood cholesterol is linked to CVD events and is an important risk factor. Reducing high blood cholesterol, is thus an important way to reduce the chances of suffering a CVD event. Statins - cholesterol lowering drugs - (e.g. simvastatin, pravastatin, atorvastatin) are the first-choice treatments. Since the early statin randomised controlled trials were reported in the 1990s, several reviews of the effects of statins have been published highlighting their benefits particularly in people with a past history of CVD. Benefits include a reduction in CVD events. Statins have also been shown to reduce the risk of a first event in otherwise healthy individuals at high risk of CVD (primary prevention) but information on possible hazards has not been reported fully. The aim of this updated systematic review is to assess the effects, both in terms of benefits and harms of statins, for the primary prevention of CVD. We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE and EMBASE until 2011. We found 18 randomised controlled trials with 19 trial arms (56,934 patients) dating from 1994 to 2008. All were randomised control trials comparing statins with usual care or placebo. The mean age of the participants was 57 years (range 28 - 97 years), 60.3% were men, and of the eight trials that reported on ethnicity, 85.9 % were Caucasian. Duration of treatment was a minimum one year and with follow-up of a minimum of six months. All-cause mortality and fatal and non-fatal CVD events were reduced with the use of statins as was the need for revascularisation (the restoration of an adequate blood supply to the heart) by means of surgery (coronary artery bypass graft ) or by angioplasty (PTCA). Of 1000 people treated with a statin for five years, 18 would avoid a major CVD event which compares well with other treatments used for preventing cardiovascular disease. Taking statins did not increase the risk of serious adverse effects such as cancer. Statins are likely to be cost-effective in primary prevention.</P>

<P>Reducing high blood cholesterol, a risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD) events in people with and without a past history of CVD is an important goal of pharmacotherapy. Statins are the first-choice agents. Previous reviews of the effects of statins have highlighted their benefits in people with CVD. The case for primary prevention was uncertain when the last version of this review was published (2011) and in light of new data an update of this review is required. </P>

<P>To avoid duplication of effort, we checked reference lists of previous systematic reviews. The searches conducted in 2007 were updated in January 2012. We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in <I>The Cochrane Library</I> (2022, Issue 4), MEDLINE OVID (1950 to December Week 4 2011) and EMBASE OVID (1980 to 2012 Week 1).There were no language restrictions.<BR/>

<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2012-12-04 14:16:31 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included randomised controlled trials of statins versus placebo or usual care control with minimum treatment duration of one year and follow-up of six months, in adults with no restrictions on total, low density lipoprotein (LDL) or high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels, and where 10% or less had a history of CVD.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2012-12-04 15:26:19 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two review authors independently selected studies for inclusion and extracted data. Outcomes included all-cause mortality, fatal and non-fatal CHD, CVD and stroke events, combined endpoints (fatal and non-fatal CHD, CVD and stroke events), revascularisation, change in total and LDL cholesterol concentrations, adverse events, quality of life and costs. Odds ratios (OR) and risk ratios (RR) were calculated for dichotomous data, and for continuous data, pooled mean differences (MD) (with 95% confidence intervals (CI)) were calculated. We contacted trial authors to obtain missing data.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-12-05 11:31:13 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The latest search found four new trials and updated follow-up data on three trials included in the original review. Eighteen randomised control trials (19 trial arms; 56,934 participants) were included. Fourteen trials recruited patients with specific conditions (raised lipids, diabetes, hypertension, microalbuminuria). All-cause mortality was reduced by statins (OR 0.86, 95% CI 0.79 to 0.94); as was combined fatal and non-fatal CVD RR 0.75 (95% CI 0.70 to 0.81), combined fatal and non-fatal CHD events RR 0.73 (95% CI 0.67 to 0.80) and combined fatal and non-fatal stroke (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.68 to 0.89). Reduction of revascularisation rates (RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.72) was also seen. Total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol were reduced in all trials but there was evidence of heterogeneity of effects. There was no evidence of any serious harm caused by statin prescription. Evidence available to date showed that primary prevention with statins is likely to be cost-effective and may improve patient quality of life. Recent findings from the Cholesterol Treatment Trialists study using individual patient data meta-analysis indicate that these benefits are similar in people at lower (&lt; 1% per year) risk of a major cardiovascular event.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Burden of cardiovascular disease</HEADING>
<P>Cardiovascular disease (CVD) encompasses a wide range of disease including coronary heart disease (e.g. heart attack, angina), cerebrovascular disease (ischaemic and haemorrhagic stroke), raised blood pressure, hypertension, rheumatic heart disease and heart failure. In the context of this review the major causes of CVD are unhealthy diets, tobacco use and physical inactivity (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>CVD is ranked as the number one cause of mortality and is a major cause of morbidity world wide accounting for 17 million deaths, 30% of total deaths. Of these, 7.6 million are due to heart attacks and 5.7 million due to stroke (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2008</LINK>). Over 80% of CVD deaths occur in low- and middle-income countries (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2008</LINK>). In developing countries, it causes twice a many deaths as HIV, malaria and tuberculosis combined (<LINK REF="REF-Gaziano-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gaziano 2007</LINK>). It has been estimated that between 1990 and 2020, the increase in ischaemic heart disease alone will increase by 29% in men and 48% in women in developed countries and by 120% in women and 127% in men in developing countries (<LINK REF="REF-Yusuf-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yusuf 2001</LINK>). CVD imposes high social costs, including impaired quality of life and reduced economic activity and accounts for a large share of health service resources (<LINK REF="REF-Gaziano-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gaziano 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>CVD is multi-factorial in its causation and lifestyle changes are the basis of any treatment strategy, with patients often requiring behavioural counselling. Those unable to achieve or maintain adequate risk reduction through lifestyle changes alone or those at high risk may benefit from pharmacotherapy. High blood cholesterol (hypercholesterolaemia) is a risk factor for both fatal and non-fatal CVD events in people with and without a past CVD (<LINK REF="REF-Prospective-Studies-Collaboration-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Prospective Studies Collaboration 2007</LINK>), and lowering cholesterol, in particular low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, is an important target for pharmacotherapy. Statins are the first-choice agents for LDL cholesterol reduction. Since the relation between blood cholesterol and cardiovascular risk is continuous (<LINK REF="REF-Chen-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chen 1991</LINK>), there is no definite threshold to initiate treatment. If a threshold for 'high' cholesterol is set at over 3.8 mmol/L, (146.9 mg/dL) this would contribute 4.4 million deaths worldwide and 40.4 million disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) (<LINK REF="REF-Ezzati-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ezzati 2002</LINK>). Furthermore, the average level of blood cholesterol within a population is an important determinant of the CVD risk of the population. Differences in average levels of blood cholesterol between populations are largely determined by differences in diet, and countries with higher dietary saturated fat intake and a lower ratio of polyunsaturated to saturated fatty acids have higher than average cholesterol levels (<LINK REF="REF-Davey-Smith-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davey Smith 1992</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="2">Trial evidence for use of statins</HEADING>
<P>Since the early statin trials were reported in the early 1990s, several reviews of the effects of statins have been published highlighting the benefits of their use (<LINK REF="REF-Baigent-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baigent 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bartlett-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bartlett 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Blauw-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blauw 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Briel-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Briel 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cheung-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cheung 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ebrahim-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ebrahim 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Katerndahl-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Katerndahl 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-LaRosa-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">LaRosa 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-LaRosa-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">LaRosa 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Law-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Law 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pignone-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pignone 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Silva-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Silva 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Thavendiranathan2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thavendiranathan2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ward-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ward 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wilt-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wilt 2004</LINK>). The Cholesterol Treatment Trialists (CTT) Collaboration has used individual patient data in their meta-analyses to show consistency of treatment benefits across a wide range of patient subgroups (<LINK REF="REF-Baigent-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baigent 2005</LINK>). More recent evidence from the CCT Collaboration has demonstrated that statins are beneficial in reducing the risk of CVD events in people without prior evidence of CVD (<LINK REF="REF-CTT-Collaboration-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">CTT Collaboration 2010</LINK>). A 2012 CTT Collaboration report further demonstrated a consistent 20% relative risk reduction in major vascular events with statins per 1mmol/L reduction in LDL cholesterol, regardless of baseline risk (<LINK REF="REF-CTT-Collaboration-2012a" TYPE="REFERENCE">CTT Collaboration 2012a</LINK>). Men and women, old and young, and people with and without CVD all appear to benefit. These findings confirm the efficacy of statins for primary prevention, resolving concerns about possible serious adverse effects and potential sources of bias in the randomised trials highlighted in an earlier version of this Cochrane review.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Adverse effects of statins</HEADING>
<P>There has been some concern, primarily from observational studies, that low levels of blood cholesterol increase the risk of mortality from causes other than coronary heart disease (CHD), including cancer, respiratory disease, liver disease and accidental/violent death. Several studies have now demonstrated that this is mostly, or entirely, due to the fact that people with low cholesterol levels include a disproportionate number whose cholesterol has been reduced by illness - early cancer, respiratory disease, gastrointestinal disease and alcoholism, among others (<LINK REF="REF-Iribarren-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Iribarren 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jacobs-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jacobs 1997</LINK>). Thus it appears to be the pre-existing disease which causes both the low cholesterol and raised mortality (<LINK REF="REF-Davey-Smith-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davey Smith 1992</LINK>).</P>
<P>The potential adverse effects of statins among people at low risk of CVD were poorly reported and unclear in earlier trials (<LINK REF="REF-Jackson-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jackson 2001</LINK>), but among those with and without pre-existing CVD the evidence now suggests that any possible hazards are far outweighed by the benefits of treatment. Two reviews of 18 and 35 trials respectively found that there were similar rates of serious adverse events with statins as compared to placebo (<LINK REF="REF-Kashani-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kashani 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Silva-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Silva 2006</LINK>). Individual patient data meta-analyses conducted by the CTT Collaboration have demonstrated unequivocally that there is no excess risk of cancers (<LINK REF="REF-CTT-Collaboration-2012b" TYPE="REFERENCE">CTT Collaboration 2012b</LINK>), confirming the findings of an earlier review and has reported reductions in all-cause mortality and no excess of non-vascular mortality (<LINK REF="REF-Dale-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dale 2006</LINK>). Rhabdomyolysis - break down of muscles - which can be serious if not detected and treated early (<LINK REF="REF-Beers-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beers 2003</LINK>) may be caused by statins, but this is very rare. In a systematic review of randomised trials of statins with about 35,000 people and 158,000 person years of observation in both treated and placebo groups, rhabdomyolysis was diagnosed in eight treated and five placebo patients, none with serious illness or death (<LINK REF="REF-Law-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Law 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>An increased risk of incident type 2 diabetes associated with statin therapy compared with usual care or placebo has been reported (<LINK REF="REF-Mills-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mills 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sattar-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sattar 2010</LINK>) and with high dose versus usual dose statins (<LINK REF="REF-Preiss-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Preiss 2011</LINK>). The mechanism by which statins may increase diabetes risk is not known. Haemorrhagic stroke appears to be increased by statin treatment, although estimates are imprecise, with an annual risk of 0.5 per 1000 patients treated for five years which is small compared with the benefits seen on the overall risk of stroke (<LINK REF="REF-CTT-Collaboration-2012a" TYPE="REFERENCE">CTT Collaboration 2012a</LINK>). Two recent meta-analyses of large-scale placebo or standard care controlled trials observed a 9% increased risk for incident diabetes associated with statin therapy, with little heterogeneity between studies. In Mills 2011(<LINK REF="REF-Mills-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mills 2011</LINK>), 17 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) reported an increased risk of the development of diabetes.</P>
<P>Other possible adverse events derived from small trials have been investigated. In a recent RCT of 1016 adults, statin treatment for six months was associated with increased self-reporting of reduced energy and fatigue on exertion (<LINK REF="REF-Golomb-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Golomb 2012</LINK>). An earlier RCT of 621 adults found that statins did not adversely affect self-reported quality of life, mood, hostility, psychological well being or anger expression (<LINK REF="REF-Wardle-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wardle 1996</LINK>). Small decrements in scores on tests of psychomotor speed and attention were found by Muldoon <I>et al</I> in an RCT of 209 adults, but Muldoon concluded that more research is needed to fully evaluate this (<LINK REF="REF-Muldoon-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Muldoon 2000</LINK>). In addition, a systematic review of five statin trials (N = 30,817) found no evidence that statins increased the risk of death from non-illness mortality (accidents, violence or suicide) (<LINK REF="REF-Muldoon-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Muldoon 2001</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>

<HEADING LEVEL="2">Guidelines for use of statins</HEADING>
<P>The evidence on the beneficial effects of statins has led expert committees to promote their use on a global scale particularly in the developed world. (<LINK REF="REF-Genest-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Genest 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Manuel-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Manuel 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NICE-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Reiner-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reiner 2011</LINK>) Statin prescribing and expenditure have risen rapidly as a result. For example, the European statin prescription average (weighted by population of each country) increased from 11.12 defined daily doses/1000 in 1997 to 41.80/1000 in 2002, an average 31% increase a year (<LINK REF="REF-Walley-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walley 2004</LINK>). The expenditure on statin drugs in England was over £20 million in 1993, over £113 million in 1997 (<LINK REF="REF-Ebrahim-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ebrahim 1998</LINK>) and has risen to more than £500 million in 2006 (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2006</LINK>).</P>

<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2012-12-04 15:29:49 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>A major limitation of the evidence summaries to date is combining trials of statins in secondary and primary prevention of CVD without reporting benefits and adverse effects separately. A number of systematic reviews have focused on statins in primary prevention, but they differ in their interpretation of the evidence (<LINK REF="REF-Brugts-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brugts 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ebrahim-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ebrahim 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NICE-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Thavendiranathan2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thavendiranathan2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vrecer_x002c_-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vrecer, 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ward-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ward 2007</LINK>). This is largely due to the differing inclusion criteria of the reviews and differences in reporting of outcomes. The most recent systematic review, using individual participant data from the majority of statin trials, provides strong evidence that benefits from statins outweigh any possible serious adverse effects, even at very low levels of CVD event rates (<LINK REF="REF-CTT-Collaboration-2012a" TYPE="REFERENCE">CTT Collaboration 2012a</LINK>). These new findings counter earlier opinion that the evidence is insufficient to support use of statins in primary prevention for women or in older men (<LINK REF="REF-Abramson-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Abramson 2007</LINK>). Previous reviews, in addition, have not reported other relevant outcomes such as costs, patient quality of life nor have they focused their attention on detailed reporting of adverse side effects.</P>
<P>The aim of this systematic review is to update and include further trials that have been published since the last search (to 2007) and contextualise our findings with those recently published by the CTT Collaboration.</P>

<P>Risk ratios (RR), odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated for dichotomous data. Quantitative analyses of outcomes was based on 'intention-to-treat' (ITT). For continuous data (such as change in blood total cholesterol), we calculated pooled mean differences (MD) (with 95% CI).</P>
<P>We did not add the number of fatal and non-fatal clinical events together from any of the studies that we included in this review as it was not possible to ascertain whether an individual who had a non-fatal clinical event followed by a fatal clinical event was counted as a clinical event under both categories. As a result, we have only included the composite of fatal and non-fatal clinical events if this was reported in the papers. For example, number of stroke events: 10 trials reported this as a composite outcome, but three reported on fatal and five on non-fatal stroke events. We did not add the fatal and non-fatal strokes together to ascertain a composite number.</P>

<P>For this update, 6442 references were identified after removal of duplicates and off these, 131 full papers were retrieved.

<P>The trials dated from 1994 to 2008 and were conducted worldwide, mainly in industrially developed countries (Japan, USA, Europe and JUPITER which included sites in South America, Israel, South Africa and Russia). Fourteen trials recruited patients with specific conditions: nine recruited participants with raised lipids, four with diabetes, two with hypertension and one with microalbuminuria.</P>
<P>All tested the effectiveness of statins compared with placebo; nine tested pravastatin 10 mg to 40 mg per day; two atorvastatin 10 mg to 80 mg per day; two fluvastatin 40 mg to 80 mg per day; two lovastatin 20 mg to 40 mg per day; two rosuvastatin 20 mg to 40 mg per day; and the remaining two simvastatin 20 mg to 40 mg per day (one of these had started patients on cerivastatin 0.4 mg per day which was replaced with simvastatin in August 2001). Five trials also included advice, counselling or information on health-behaviour modification such as diet, smoking cessation, or exercise.</P>
<P>In total, the 18 trials (with 19 trial arms) recruited 56,934 participants and observed outcomes ranging from one to 5.3 years. The size of the population recruited ranged from 47to 17,802.

Overall, these trials had recruited 47% of the total study population and were stopped 1.4 to 3.0 years before the pre-specified end date.</P>
<P>Data on all-cause mortality were provided in 11 trials. Excluding the four trials whose primary outcome was change in size of carotid artery and one whose primary endpoint was change in bone density, nine of the remaining trials chose a composite primary outcome.

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2012-12-04 15:37:19 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The trials included in this systematic review showed reductions in all-cause mortality, composite cardiovascular disease (CVD) endpoints, fatal and non-fatal CVD events considered separately, total and low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and revascularisations. These findings were associated with falls in total and LDL cholesterol in all trials reporting these outcomes. No excess of combined adverse events, cancers, myopathy, rhabdomyolysis, haemorrhagic stroke, liver enzyme elevation, renal dysfunction and arthritis were found, although not all trials reported fully on adverse events. An increased risk of incident diabetes was found in the two trials reporting this outcome. There was limited evidence to suggest that the use of statins for primary prevention may be cost-effective. However, in light of new evidence derived from the CTT Collaboration on primary prevention, there is a need to up-date existing cost-effective analysis. Patient perceived quality of life was reported in only one trial, which showed limited benefit. Sensitivity analysis suggested that early stopping of trials and size of trial did not influence the overall results.</P>
<P>Although the trials intended to recruit only people without evidence of CVD, some trials did include some participants with CVD. Rather than exclude such trials, we set an arbitrary threshold of 10% to avoid any major influence of effects of treatment on those with existing CVD. A sensitivity analysis, excluding the five trials that had up to 10% participants with clinical evidence of CVD at baseline, showed very little difference between effect sizes compared with all the trials included in this review. Our findings concur with previous systematic reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Brugts-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brugts 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ebrahim-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ebrahim 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NICE-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2006</LINK>). However, previous systematic reviews have included trials where more than 10% of participants had a previous history of CVD which is reflected in their higher baseline all-cause mortality event rates which were 1.4 per 100 person years at risk (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2006</LINK>) and 1.7 per 100 person years (<LINK REF="REF-Brugts-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brugts 2009</LINK>) compared with 1.0 per 100 person years in this review.</P>
<P>The CTT Collaboration has published analyses focusing on the comparison between high and low doses of statins which demonstrate that more intensive treatment lowers LDL cholesterol more, resulting in greater benefits (<LINK REF="REF-CTT-Collaboration-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">CTT Collaboration 2010</LINK>) with no excess risk of non-vascular mortality.  However, a increase in the risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis in people treated with statins is confirmed, particularly among those treated with higher rather than lower doses statins (<LINK REF="REF-Armitage-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Armitage 2007</LINK>). Strong evidence of the absence of any adverse effects on cancer risk is also confirmed by a further CTT Collaboration report (<LINK REF="REF-CTT-Collaboration-2012b" TYPE="REFERENCE">CTT Collaboration 2012b</LINK>).</P>
<P>Our estimates of effects on CVD outcomes and on all-cause mortality on statins are in line with the recent CTT Collaboration report (<LINK REF="REF-CTT-Collaboration-2012a" TYPE="REFERENCE">CTT Collaboration 2012a</LINK>). The major finding of this new report is the benefits from statins at low levels of CVD risk: six and 15 major vascular events would be avoided per 1000 people treated for five years in the two lowest baseline risk categories (&lt; 5% five-year risk, RR 0·57 (0·36 to 0·89) and 5% to 10% five-year risk RR 0·61 (0·50 to 0·74)) respectively (Figure 1, CTT report), giving NNT values of 167 and 67 respectively. These NNTs are well within the range considered worthwhile in primary prevention (e.g. for treatment of hypertension).</P>
<P>The individual patient data analyses conducted by the CTT Collaboration counter concerns about the interpretation of the evidence of statins for primary prevention. First, the use of composite endpoints derived from different CVD outcomes is overcome since there is sufficient power to demonstrate benefits for individual CVD outcomes. Second, additional data on outcomes are available for most trials, which reduces any effect of selective reporting of outcomes. Third, similar benefits of statins were seen in trials that stopped early and in those running their planned course. Fourth, concerns about effects in low-risk groups, particularly women, are now demonstrated to be similar to those in other trial participants. Fifth, the benefits of statins outweigh any risks of serious adverse effects since no excess of cancers was found and all-cause mortality was lower in those on statins. Thus, earlier claims that statins provide no overall benefit in primary prevention in terms of all-cause mortality (<LINK REF="REF-Therapeutics-Letter-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Therapeutics Letter 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Therapeutics-Letter-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Therapeutics Letter 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ray-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ray 2010</LINK>) can no longer be substantiated.</P>
<P>Haemorrhagic stroke may be increased by use of statins with an annual excess risk of 0.5 per 1000 people treated over five years per 1·0 mmol/L LDL cholesterol reduction reported by the CTT Collaboration. However, overall stroke events were reduced, indicating a net benefit. This might not be the case in Asian populations where haemorrhagic stroke is more common than ischaemic stroke, and where evidence of association between low blood cholesterol and haemorrhagic stroke has been reported (<LINK REF="REF-Ebrahim-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ebrahim 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>Our review, with sparse data, found an increased risk of type 2 diabetes in those treated with statins: RR 1.18 (95% CI 1.01 to 1.39), which is greater than the that found in a more comprehensive meta-analysis using both published and unpublished data from 13 trials (both primary and secondary prevention) which reported a relative risk of 1·09; 95% CI 1·02 to 1·17, with a number needed to harm of 255 people treated for four years to result in one case of diabetes (<LINK REF="REF-Preiss-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Preiss 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sattar-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sattar 2010</LINK>). This increased risk of diabetes appears to be related to baseline fasting glucose levels and metabolic syndrome among participants randomised to statins (<LINK REF="REF-Waters-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Waters 2011</LINK>). It can be argued that the overall small proportion of people who develop diabetes when treated with a statin is outweighed by the benefits of statins (<LINK REF="REF-CTT-Collaboration-2012a" TYPE="REFERENCE">CTT Collaboration 2012a</LINK>). However, in the context of primary prevention, patients may expect not to be harmed in any way by 'preventive' treatments. Patient view points of such trade-offs remain to be assessed and will be important in determining wider use of statins (<LINK REF="REF-Smeeth-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smeeth 2012</LINK>).</P>
<P>All but one of the trials had some form of pharmaceutical industry sponsorship. It is now established that published pharmaceutical industry-sponsored trials are more likely than non-industry-sponsored trials to report results and conclusions that favour drug over placebo due to biased reporting and/or interpretation of trial results (<LINK REF="REF-Als_x002d_Nielsen-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Als-Nielsen 2003</LINK>). The reporting of adverse events in these trials is generally poor, with failure to provide details of severity and type of adverse events or to report on health-related quality of life. However, it seems unlikely that any major life-threatening hazards associated with statin use exist. Potential non-fatal but serious hazards of long-term statin use have not been assessed in trials (e.g. possible cognitive impairments suggested by one small trial: <LINK REF="REF-Muldoon-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Muldoon 2000</LINK>). We have focused on adverse events arising in randomised trial populations but these cannot adequately assess rare hazards, such as rhabdomyolysis. Large observational databases are useful for detecting rare hazards associated with use of statins but a causal attribution is more difficult to establish (<LINK REF="REF-Hippsley_x002d_Cox-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hippsley-Cox 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Smeeth-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smeeth 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>Our previous conclusion urging caution in the use of statins in people at low risk of cardiovascular events is no longer tenable in light of the CTT Collaboration findings. Several issues remain to be considered before widespread use of statins could be recommended in people at low risk (<LINK REF="REF-Ebrahim-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ebrahim 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Smeeth-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smeeth 2012</LINK>). These include: i) the feasibility and desirability of having to treat the majority of people over the age of 50 with a statin; ii) the cost-effectiveness of such a strategy using a conventional healthcare delivery system; iii) diversion of attention from achieving coverage in people at high risk of events; iv) use of alternative public health strategies to lower blood cholesterol; v) the views of patients on life-long drug therapy; and vi) limited evidence on less serious but nonetheless potentially important adverse effects and quality of life.</P>
<P>The National Institute for Health &amp; Clinical Excellence UK (NICE) has provided some cost-effectiveness estimates based on data to 2005 and conclude that an annual risk of a CHD event ranging from 3% to 0.5%, the ranges of cost per quality adjusted life year gained (QALY) gained were £10,000 to £31,000 at age 45 years, £13,000 to £40,000 at age 55 years using older generic statins (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2006</LINK>). Their guidance is to use statins "... as part of the management strategy for the primary prevention of CVD for adults who have a 20% or greater 10-year risk of developing CVD." Evidence supporting the use of statins as part of an overall strategy of identification of people at high risk of CVD events and lowering blood pressure and blood cholesterol has been produced for low- and middle-income countries (<LINK REF="REF-Lim-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lim 2007</LINK>) and is now part of World Health Organization's policy for CVD prevention (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2008b" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2008b</LINK>).</P>
<P>Low cost generic statins are now widely available and recent cost-effectiveness studies show that statins are cost-saving in the USA even in people at low levels of predicted CHD risk. To gain maximal impact from using statins, 64 million people in the USA (just under half of the over 35 year old population) would need to be put on treatment at a cost of US$2,800 per QALY gained (<LINK REF="REF-Lazar-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lazar 2011</LINK>).  These cost-effectiveness estimates are likely to be better for more potent statins and in lower cost health services. </P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2012-12-04 15:32:43 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The totality of evidence now supports the benefits of statins for primary prevention. The individual patient data meta-analyses now provide strong evidence to support their use in people at low risk of cardiovascular disease. Further cost-effectiveness analyses are now needed to guide widening their use to these low risk groups.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2012-12-04 15:32:43 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In addition to the cost-effectiveness analyses referred to above, it will be useful to study the effects of public health interventions that attempt to alter diet and physical activity patterns and compare their effects with statins in robust randomised trials given recent evidence of large independent survival benefits of physical fitness in those taking statins in a large prospective cohort study (<LINK REF="REF-Kokkinos-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kokkinos 2012</LINK>). Relevant interventions might include nutrition education, exercise prescription, physical education curriculums that may be effective in changing lifestyle behaviours. (<LINK REF="REF-Jepson-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jepson 2000</LINK>) Studies of patient experiences and views on long-term use of statins are also needed to improve adherence to treatment. It is likely that further trials will be conducted in younger adults with adverse risk factor profiles which are associated with higher lifetime CVD risk (<LINK REF="REF-Berry-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Berry 2012</LINK>) and also in children (<LINK REF="REF-de-Ferranti-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">de Ferranti 2008</LINK>). It is important that these trials examine comprehensively potential adverse effects of statins and quality of life, reporting on them in an unbiased way.</P>

<P>The recent CTT Lancet November 2010 paper was not available to our team at the time the review was completed and submitted for publication to the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. We agree that a data point in Figure 3 gives the proportional and absolute effects on major vascular events of a 1mmol/l reduction in LDL cholesterol in trial participants without prior cardiovascular disease. Our estimate of this effect and its precision is similar to the CTT estimate. I am surprised that CTT did not provide more information on other outcomes among participants taking statins for primary prevention. In particular, others have raised the issue of all-cause mortality in primary prevention trials (Ray et al, Arch Intern Med. 2010;170:1024-1031) and have expressed concerns about an increased risk of diabetes in those taking statins (Sattar et al, Lancet 2010;375:735-42). We will, of course, include reference to the CTT paper and will remove the text stating that CTT was &#8220;unable to provide the relevant analysis for inclusion in our review&#8221;. It should be feasible to make these changes in the next issue. Work is underway to conduct a comprehensive update of this review as soon as possible.</P>

<B>Re: Statins for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews 2011, Issue 1. </B>
</P>
<P>Thanks for your letter of 22 February 2011. The recent CTT Lancet November 2010 paper was not available to our team at the time the review was completed and submitted for publication to the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. We agree that a data point in Figure 3 gives the proportional and absolute effects on major vascular events of a 1mmol/l reduction in LDL cholesterol in trial participants without prior cardiovascular disease. Our estimate of this effect and its precision is similar to the CTT estimate. I am surprised that CTT did not provide more information on other outcomes among participants taking statins for primary prevention. In particular, others have raised the issue of all-cause mortality in primary prevention trials (Ray et al, <I>Arch Intern Med. </I>2010;170:1024-1031) and have expressed concerns about an increased risk of diabetes in those taking statins (Sattar et al, Lancet 2010;375:735-42). We will, of course, include reference to the CTT paper and will remove the text stating that CTT was &#8220;unable to provide the relevant analysis for inclusion in our review&#8221;. It should be feasible to make these changes in the next issue.</P>
<P>The press release was referring to the association of low blood cholesterol (not cholesterol lowering by statins) with haemorrhagic stroke which has been shown by several observational cohorts, including a large Korean civil servants cohort (n=3900 haemorrhagic strokes), but these associations may be confounded. It would obviously be of great value to have a more reliable estimate of this effect by randomization to statins than that reported in the recent CTT paper (RR 1.12 (95% CI: 0.93, 1.35) per 1 mmol/L reduction in LDL cholesterol, webfigure 8) which might be achieved if more trials provided this outcome. More robust estimates would be particularly helpful for low and middle income countries where underlying rates of haemorrhagic stroke remain high and statins, as part of a &#8220;polypill&#8221; strategy, are being promoted for primary prevention.</P>
<P>We are already working on a full update of the review and have 7,000 citations to work through inclusion/exclusion criteria. In addition to the changes for the next issue, if you want I can arrange to have your letter and my response entered in the correspondence section linked to the review. This would enable your concerns to be immediately linked to the review and be readily available to readers of the review. Let me know your preference.</P>

<BR/>Dear Shah<BR/>Thank you for your response. One quick point of clarification, the press release actually says "low cholesterol has been<B> shown to increase</B> [my emphasis] the risk of death from other causes" which is clearly quite different from what you have written in the second paragraph of your letter and is dangerously irresponsible. I wondered, therefore, if &#8212; before considering publication &#8212; you would like to make this error clear in your letter and ensure that the statement in the press release is formally retracted.</P>
<P>Rory Collins<BR/>
<BR/>
</P>
<P>
<U>04 March 2011</U>
<BR/>Dear Rory<BR/>I agree the wording is quite wrong. The press statement has not been published, nor is it available to readers of the review itself.  I will add a sentence saying that a press release about the review contained a seriously misleading statement that "low cholesterol has been shown to increase the risk of death from other causes".  <BR/>Shah Ebrahim</P>
<P> </P>
<P>
<U>4 March 2011</U>
</P>
<P>Thank you for your proposal to modify your letter which is fine as far as it goes. The statement in this press release (which engendered wide publicity) is, however, so dangerously wrong that I think the Cochrane Collaboration is obliged to issue a public retraction. Please could you forward my correspondence to whoever is responsible for dealing with such serious misrepresentations within the Collaboration?<BR/>Rory Collins<BR/>
<BR/>
</P>
<P>
<U>4 March 2011</U>
</P>
<P>In the first instance, if we have published something that is misleading or incorrect in the press release I would suggest that we issue a correction in the release accompanying the next issue. I would like to explore with the writer of the release how this happened, as this is the first time that we have had such a complaint in relation to a press release, to the best of my knowledge. Having said that I am responsible for the sign off of press releases so that any error is entirely my responsibility.<BR/>I am making some enquiries as a matter of urgency and will let you all know when we have a proposed course of action.<BR/>David Tovey</P>
<P> </P>
<P>
<U>4 March 2011</U>
</P>
<P>Shah Ebrahim has confirmed that the statement is wrong (see below) and, in public health terms, it is potentially a far more serious misrepresentation than that of the risks of MMR by Wakefield and The Lancet. As a consequence, I think it requires an urgent and specific response by the Cochrane Collaboration and should not just be "buried" in a routine press release.<BR/>Rory Collins</P>
<P> </P>
<P>
<U>8 March 2011</U>
</P>
<P>This is to update you in relation to our current plans in relation to correction of the press release.<BR/>Firstly, we are will contact via email in the next 48 hours, all individuals and agencies that received the original press release for Issue 1 and explain the need for a correction of the offending sentence. Secondly, we will publish a correction on The Cochrane Library homepage explaining the error. I anticipate that this will happen later today.  Thirdly we will do our utmost to ensure that anywhere where the press release is still &#8220;live&#8221;, it is modified to a more satisfactory form of words.<BR/>The Cochrane Collaboration sets a high value on quality, scientific rigour and transparency. In this instance we are grateful to you for pointing out an error in the press release that had evaded our editorial system. Please be assured that we regarded this as a serious matter, and have sought to implement visible and appropriate measures to correct the error. We have also learned lessons from the episode that once implemented will reduce the chance of a similar event in the future.<BR/>David Tovey</P>

</P>
<P>Thank you for taking some steps towards dealing with this problem as the errors of fact in both the press release, as well as those in the related paper (see our original letter to Shah Ebrahim and his reply: attached), have had a damaging effect on public health (as well as on the credibility of the Cochrane Collaboration).   It is very much to your credit that you wish to take final responsibility (as editor) for these errors, but should not the authors also take some of the responsibility (rather than just passing the buck) since they presumably approved the press release which quotes them?<BR/>I have now had an opportunity to read your Correction on the Cochrane Library website and, though welcome, it seems to me that it is incomplete (given the errors in the original paper) and, indeed, is misleadingly half-hearted.  For example, Shah Ebrahim accepts in his letter to us that, by contrast with what he had claimed in his paper, results for the highly statistical benefits in patients with no prior cardiovascular disease (risk ratio for major vascular events: 0.75; 95% CI 0.69 - 0.82) had been published nearly 3 months beforehand.  Your Correction would have been an opportunity to put that straight, rather than to assert that such errors  do "not impact in any way on the validity of the accompanying Cochrane Review". Similarly, please could you explain why the claim in the press release that "low cholesterol has been shown to increase the risk of death from other causes, statins may do more harm than good" is, according to the assertion in your correction, "irrelevant to the underlying question being evaluated"? This does not seem to be correct.<BR/>I'm sorry not to have replied to your letter sooner, but I was waiting to see the Correction before doing so and was looking for it on the Cochrane Collaboration website, where it does  not appear.  As well as having it on the Cochrane Library website, would it not be appropriate to put this Correction (or, preferably, a more accurate one) on the Cochrane Collaboration website (and any other Cochrane websites), especially since the statin paper is one of its featured reviews?<BR/>I do hope that you will reconsider the partial (in more than one sense) attempt that you've made so far to redress the serious harm that has been caused to public health by the Cochrane Collaboration and its misinterpretation of the available evidence (which does not seem to be at all consistent with your key principles).<BR/>Rory Collins<BR/>
<BR/>
</P>
<P>
<U>10 March 2011</U>
<BR/>I suspect we have reached an impasse. I really don&#8217;t accept that the response was half-hearted. To repeat, we have placed a highly visible correction on  the homepage of the product that was the subject of the press release, we have sent an email to all recipients of that press release, and we have sought to correct any existing versions of the press release that are still in circulation.<BR/>I, not the Co-ordinating Editor, sign off the press release, so this was my error alone. It was, as you pointed out, a seriously incorrect message &#8211; implying that the very act of reducing your serum cholesterol might cause early death &#8211; and could, if acted upon have caused public harm. For that reason I recognised the need to act decisively and swiftly to correct any wrong impression. I made the point in the correction that the press release mistake was based on a misunderstanding of the Cochrane Review, which had explicitly explained that any possible association was highly unlikely to be based on cause and effect. Therefore I believe it was correct to be clear that the press release was distinct from the review.<BR/>I recognise that you have also raised questions in relation to the content of the review. As Shah describes in his response, he has taken on board your comments, explained why the Lancet paper was not considered in the original published version, and has sought to amend the review appropriately at the earliest opportunity. For technical /publication reasons there will be an inevitable but short delay before the changes are published.<BR/>I am aware that you are unlikely to agree, but I am confident that our response to the questions you have raised in relation to the press release and the review has been appropriate, open and positive.<BR/>David Tovey</P>
<P> </P>
<P>
<U>11 March 2011</U>
</P>
<P>I'm extremely grateful both for your careful response to my email and for what you've been able to do to rectify this problem.  I did have a couple of questions in my previous email which I'd be grateful if you'd consider.  First, might it be possible to put the Correction on the Cochrane Collaboration website as well, since that would be an obvious place where people alerted by the original press release would go? Second, why do you say in the Correction that the claim in the press release that "low cholesterol has been shown to increase the risk of death from other causes, statins may do more harm than good" is "irrelevant to the underlying question being evaluated" by this meta-analysis of whether statins do more harm than good?  I had thought that this Correction would have provided an opportunity to indicate that errors in the original paper would also be corrected at the earliest possible opportunity.<BR/>Again, thanks for taking the issue so seriously and for going as far as you have towards repairing the damage caused.<BR/>Rory Collins</P>

<BR/>Feedback: Dear respected authors and editors of the Cochrane Heart Group, First, in the abstract of the systematic review, statistically significant relative risk reductions were reported for all-cause mortality, non-fatal CVD events, and revascularisations. However, I had trouble applying this knowledge in practice because there was no mention of the absolute risk reduction or number needed to treat associated with statin use in this clinical setting. I thought these two values would be of clinical relevance since the review defined primary prevention as treating people without evidence of existing cardiovascular disease, who would be expected to have low baseline risks. Furthermore, despite the statistically significant relative risk reductions of key outcomes without an increase in adverse events found by this review, the authors advised caution before prescribing statins for primary prevention. This was a point of confusion for me, as I could not understand how the authors came to that conclusion. I think that because many people in the world have only access to the Cochrane abstracts and plain language summary, the rationale for the conclusions should be explicit to the reader. Lastly, on the abstract page this review was assessed as up-to-date on September 7, 2007, even though it was published on January 19, 2011. I was not sure if that was a mistake.</P>

<P>Dear Qiming Roger Wu,<BR/>Thank you for your feedback on this review of statins for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease. You would like to see absolute risk differences and numbers needed to treat. We have not provided these as they are often misleading in primary prevention. The absolute levels of CVD risk used will depend on a) what is included in 'CVD' (e.g. new angina cases, revasularisations), b) the population in which you practice (CVD incidence varies markedly between countries), c) age group and sex of the population considered. The relative risk reduction figure is stable across outcomes, populations, age and sex groups. The NNT is not and presenting several NNTs is confusing for the reader.<BR/>
</P>
<P>You are concerned about why we recommend caution in using statins for primary prevention despite the statistically significant relative risk reduction. This is because the quality of the trials is variable (early stopping, selective reporting of outcomes), many do not report any adverse events (which is unlikely to be true), and guidelines in UK, USA and Europe do not recommend their use at levels below 20% 10-year risk of CVD. This is discussed in detail in the main text but not in the abstract for reasons of space. In the abstract we say: 'Other potential adverse events were not reported and some trials included people with cardiovascular disease. Only limited evidence showed that primary prevention with statins may be cost-effective and improve patient quality of life.' This gives some, but not all, of the rationale for use with caution. You question whether the review is as out of date as it appears. I am afraid it is. This is because doing a Cochrane review on statins requires searching for relevant papers - in this case we had to sift through thousands of abstracts of papers, retrieve hundreds of full papers, assess them in duplicate to reach our final 14 trials for consideration. This takes time and in this case was made worse as the key authors were relocated to work in India on another project that took priority over this review. We have conducted an update and hope that this will be published before the end of 2012.<BR/>Thank you for your interest in our work.<BR/>

<P>Dear Colleagues,<BR/>I am writing to express concerns about the Cochrane Review update of statins for primary prevention (Taylor et al 2013.) I have three principle concerns which involve Taylor et al&#8217;s treatment of 1) potential commercial bias, 2) data transparency, and 3)patient safety.<BR/>
<BR/>Recent research indicates that commercial bias may be an important factor in evaluating the validity of published trial data and may be more important than a checklist of technical factors in determining bias. Bero, Lexchin, Lundh and other colleagues, for example, have pointed out a variety of issues in this regard (eg Bero et al 2007; Roseman et al 2012; Lundh et al 2012). Most recently, describing the research of Lundh et al&#8217;s ( 2012) Cochrane Review on industry sponsorship and research outcomes, Bero (2013; JAMA Intern Med) has stated that standard assessment tools do not adequately grapple with risk of bias. She noted that Lundh et al (2012) reviewed nine studies with seemingly low risk of bias but the relationship between sponsorship and outcomes was in fact stronger. The Cochrane authors, citing Als-Nielsen (2003) note the possibility of commercial bias briefly but fail to explain why they do not consider it more fully in their analysis.<BR/>
<BR/>Will the authors clarify why they did not fully address commercial sponsorship as a risk of bias?<BR/>
<BR/>Taylor et al (2013) rely heavily on industry-sponsored trials and the meta-analysis by the CTT indicating that the CTT&#8217;s commercial sponsorship isanalysis rests in their use of patient-level data. However, it is known that many scholars have asked the CTT for data without success (interalia Criqui and Golomb 2004, Walsh and Pignone 2004, Petretta 2008.) As I understand the Review by Taylor and colleagues they seem not to have reviewed that data but are relying on the CTT&#8217;s interpretations. Currently many scholars are asking for transparency and the release of primary source data like Clinical Study Reports and patient-level data (eg Doshi and Jefferson) so that the larger scientific community can be more fully informed. This broader perspective is important in understanding both benefit and harm through a lens other than that provided by industry.<BR/>
<BR/>Will the authors clarify why they did not ask for full transparency but seemingly relied on CTT analysis?<BR/>
<BR/>In terms of issues related to harm, the Review is both troubling and confusing. It is known that harms are under-reported in commercial trials. The Cochrane authors state that 12 trials provided data on Adverse Events, indicating that one third did not provide data on AEs. They previously stated (page 3) that the trial authors were contacted to obtain further details. It is, thus, not clear if the AE data was withheld from the Cochrane reviewers or were not collected in the original trials. The authors state (page 14) that reporting of adverse events in the statin trials is relatively poor, since there is a failure to provide important details of type and severity of AEs. But they then state with (no citations) that it &#8220;seems unlikely that major<BR/>life-threatening hazards associated with statin use exist.&#8221; And they go on to state that potential non-fatal but serious adverse events have not been assessed in statin trials. They briefly touch on the recent work by Hippsley-Cox (20120) but seem to discount the value of database analysis for detecting statin harm. It is, thus, not clear why Taylor and colleagues have chosen to deem statins safe for primary prevention for men and women on the basis of clinical trial data with serious limitations in safety information. Nor is it clear why they did not consider information about harm from a wider variety of sources including advisories from countries like New Zealand, UK and the USA. Many sources indicate that clinical trials are not geared towards<BR/>real-world experiences of harm. For example, Fernandez and colleagues at the Cleveland Clinic (2011) state that statin myopathy is a common experience that is not reflected in clinical trials and that muscle symptoms occurred in up to 20% of patients on statins. They point out that real-world conditions should be considered, and note the relatively low level of myalgia (1%-5%) described in clinical trials. Other institutions have, like the Mayo Clinic, have created Statin Intolerance<BR/>Clinics acknowledging people&#8217;s every day experiences with statin harms. Oskarsson (2011; Neurology) states that there is particular concern about necrotizing statin myopathy wherein recovery does not occur with cessation of statin-exposure. (See also research by rheumatologists like Mammen and colleagues on treatments for statin-associated autoimmune necrotizing myopathies.)<BR/>
<BR/>Pharmacovigilance can play an important role in detecting signals of harm, which the Cochrane authors do not fully consider. Sakaeda et al (2011) analyzed data on muscular and renal events in FDA data base and found evidence of signals of harm warranting clinical trial research. There is also an important social context in adverse event reporting. Research indicates adverse event reporting to be low, possibly because of failure to recognize statin associated symptoms (Dirks and Jones,<BR/>2006) or physician reluctance to report (Golomb et al., 2007.) Taylor and colleagues have also not dealt with the issue that statins are considered a category X drug in the USA and are associated with miscarriage and birth defects (see for example Edison and Muenke, 2004 and Prescrire 2005.) Taylor and coseem to suggest that women of child-bearing capacity (over age 35; page 15) would benefit from statins without considering this important harm. Taylor and colleagues indicate that in using CTT patient level data they have examined the &#8220;totality of evidence&#8221; for primary prevention<BR/>statin use.<BR/>
<BR/>This does not seem possible. I am concerned that the voices of patients are not heard in this review. I do not see evidence of pro-active research strategies addressing patient safety. The importance of interrogating the quality of safety reporting in clinical trials is seen as valuable within the research community but it is raised in a confusing way in this review; both acknowledging problems and then discounting their relevance. Other sources of data are not adequately considered. </P>
<P>
<BR/>Will the authors explain what they mean by &#8220;the totality of evidence&#8221; and why they have not attempted to proactively secure safety data from trialists nor consider other forms of independent information about statin-related harms?<BR/>

<P>Thank you for your interest in our review.  We respond to your questions and hope you find them helpful in understanding our approach, both its strengths and its limitations.  </P>
<P> 1. Will the authors clarify why they did not fully address commercial sponsorship as a risk of bias?</P>
<P> The potential bias associated with commercial sponsorship of trials is well-recognised.  We collected and reported information on the funding source of all trials included in our review.  We were unable to evaluate this form of potential bias through comparison of effect sizes between commercially funded trials and non-commercially funded trials, since every trial was commercially funded. We have addressed commercial sponsorship to the extent possible in this circumstance.  We would be pleased to learn of alternative approaches in these circumstances.</P>
<P> 2. Will the authors clarify why they did not ask for full transparency but seemingly relied on Cholesterol Treatment Trialists (CTT) analysis?</P>
<P> Our analysis did not rely on the CTT analyses.  Our meta-analyses are based on published data from trials on statins. CTT is based on individual patient data and covers an overlapping set of statin trials in both primary and secondary prevention. We are aware that attempts to obtain individual patient data from CTT does not appear to be feasible, and we did not ask the CTT investigators for data as we did not require their data to carry out our systematic review.  It is important to recognise that in any systematic review using Cochrane methods a thorough search is made for all relevant trials, independent of source of funding.  We then conducted our analysis using published data and made requests to the individual trial authors, where necessary, for data on specific outcomes.  As the CTT had published highly relevant analyses since our 2011 publication, it was imperative for us to update our review in light of their findings.  Our findings obtained from the published literature and findings from the CTT are remarkably similar, so we do not believe that there are any issues with the integrity of their analyses.</P>
<P>3. Will the authors explain what they mean by &#8220;the totality of evidence&#8221; and why they have not attempted to proactively secure safety data from trialists nor consider other forms of independent information about statin-related harms?</P>
<P> We considered the randomized evidence in this Cochrane review and on that basis believe we have the totality of this evidence.  We have attempted to get additional information from trialists but did not set out to duplicate successful efforts that have others have made to get additional data. CTT have been particularly successful in this regard (as have others with respect to type 2 diabetes). Individual patient level data are needed to do this well and is a long term goal for our group.   We have also considered other non-randomized data in our discussion.</P>
<P> We concluded that it &#8220;seems unlikely that major life-threatening hazards associated with statin use exist.&#8221;  This is based on the all-cause mortality relative risk of 0.86 (95% CI 0.79 to 0.94).  This means that, overall, any unintended effect of statins that was severe enough to cause death would be highly unlikely as we do not see any increased overall death rate on statins.   We accept that trials generally do not report unintended effects of treatments well, and statin trials are no exception. </P>
<P>The analyses from the CTT have explored the possibility of hazards due to cancers and found no evidence of any increased risk of any cancer.  We believe these data are reliable and are consistent with our own analyses from the trial reports.  We also considered myalgia/rhabdomyolosis, type 2 diabetes, haemorrhagic stroke, liver dysfunction, renal dysfunction and arthritis.</P>
<P>We also examined adherence with treatment rates and found 77% participants and 70% in the placebo group complied with treatment; RR 1.08 (0.98 to 1.18), indicating that while 23-30% of patients stopped treatment, this was more common in those taking placebo than in those taking statins.</P>
<P>We have not made any specific reference to use of statins in women of child-bearing age, in whom it would be most unlikely for statins to be indicated.   We do report that women gain similar benefit to men, which was not clear in previous reviews.</P>
<P>With regard to other potentially serious, but non-fatal unintended effects of statins, we do not discount Hippsley-Cox&#8217;s report (or Smeeth&#8217;s report) as large scale observational data are often the only way of determining possible unexpected harms.  However, they are prone to confounding and do not provide the robust evidence that randomized trials do.</P>
<P>There are many observational reports of harms associated with statins, and this literature frequently reports contradictory findings. We are currently conducting a separate systematic review of these studies and are also conducting a further large scale primary care database analysis.  These studies are complex to perform, have taken separate funding to conduct, yet should be ready for submission for publication later this year.</P>

<P>1. Why did you decided to use the 10 year follow-up ('post-trial period') and not the 'trial period' outcomes for the WOSCOPS study (Tables 1 and 2, NEJM 2007 357;15,1477-1486) for the quoted outcomes? This increases the weighting of WOSOCPS greatly and affects the event rate and subsequently ARR or NNT based on control rates.<BR/>
<BR/>2. Where did you source the PREVEND-IT total mortality figures of 10/433 in the statin group and 8/431 from? This is not clear to me from reading the source paper and other meta-analyses list the figures as 13/433 and 12/431 resppectively (Tonelli M et al. Efficacy of statins for primary prevention in people at low cardiovascular risk: a meta-analysis. CMAJ 2011. DOI:10.1503/cmaj.101280 and Ray K et al Statins and All-Cause Mortality in High-Risk Primary Prevention: A Meta-analysis of 11 Randomized Controlled Trials Involving 65 229 Participants.

<P>1. If there are longer follow ups available it does make some sense to use them to increase the overall events, particularly if they are sparse which is the case in trials of primary prevention. However, it is generally better to carry out two analyses: trial end outcomes and longest outcomes to explore how publication of longer follow ups may be biasing the overall effect size. There is a tendency for trialists who have found continued benefits to publish such data but not to publish if these findings if they are null. We will carry out this analysis in the next update of this review.<BR/>
<BR/>NNTs are highly susceptible to the underlying rates used to estimated them and, in my opinion are potentially quite spurious when derived from trial control groups (which tend to be healthier than the populations in which drugs are used, even in primary prevention). Sensitivity analyses are always worth doing using trial control group rates, general population rates (often available from large GP databases), and separated by gender and age groups.<BR/>
<BR/>2. With regard to the data abstracted for PREVEND-IT, I am not able to confirm the source of the data used as I will not be in London where the data abstraction sheets are stored - and won't be until end of February. It is quite possible that these are errors given your cross-checking with the original paper and other meta-analyses. So thank you for drawing my attention to this and it will be checked, and if in error, corrected in the next update.<BR/>

<P>At our department we teach EBM to doctors in training for general practice. One of our students have studied statins in primary prevention and used your review thoroughly.</P>
<P>In the calculations of NNT she (ABH) had difficulties following your calculations and two senior researchers (AM+OO) could not help her out.</P>
<P>In relation to total mortality you state:</P>
<P>&#8221;All-cause mortality. Thirteen trials with 48,060 participants recruited reported on total mortality. During observation, 1077/24,408 (4.4%) died in the statin group compared with 1223/23,652 (5.1%) in the placebo group; number needed to treat for five years: 96 (95% confidence interval (CI) 64 to 244).&#8221;</P>
<P>However, we calculate ARR: 5.1%-4.4% = 0.7%, and if we use the traditional formula NNT = 1/ ARR, we get NNT= 143, i.e. larger than your NNT = 96.</P>
<P>Similarly, in relation to fatal and non-fatal CHD events you state:</P>
<P>&#8220;Fourteen trials with 48,049 participants reported on combined fatal and non-fatal CHD events. Four trials showed evidence of a reduction in this combined outcome, which was maintained in the pooled analysis using a fixed-effect model: 820/24,217 (3.4%) in the statin group versus 1114/23,832 (4.6%) in the placebo group. Overall NNT for five years: 56 (95% CI 46 to 75);&#8221;</P>
<P>But we get ARR = 4.6%-3.4% = 1.2%, and thus NNT = 83, i.e. again larger than your NNT = 56.</P>
