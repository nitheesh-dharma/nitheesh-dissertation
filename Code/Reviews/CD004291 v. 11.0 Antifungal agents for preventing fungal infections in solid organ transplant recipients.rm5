<SUMMARY>
<TITLE>Antifungal drugs used for prevention can significantly reduce the number of invasive fungal infections in liver transplant patients</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Invasive fungal infections - infections of the bloodstream and organs within the body (e.g. meningitis, pneumonia, peritonitis) - are important causes of morbidity and mortality in liver, pancreas, heart, kidney and lung (i.e. solid organ) transplant recipients. This review found that fluconazole, used as a preventive drug, significantly reduced the number of invasive fungal infections in liver transplant patients. More studies are needed to determine how effective antifungal drugs are for pancreas, heart, kidney and lung transplant patients.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Invasive fungal infections (IFIs) are important causes of morbidity and mortality in solid organ transplant recipients.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>This study aims to systematically identify and summarise the effects of antifungal prophylaxis in solid organ transplant recipients. </P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2008-09-15 19:01:13 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE (from 1966), and EMBASE (from 1980) were searched. Reference lists, abstracts of conference proceedings and scientific meetings (1998-2003) were handsearched. Authors of included studies and pharmaceutical manufacturers were contacted.<BR/>
</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in all languages comparing the prophylactic use of any antifungal agent or regimen with placebo, no antifungal, or another antifungal agent or regimen.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Two reviewers independently applied selection criteria, performed quality assessment, and extracted data using an intention-to-treat approach. Differences were resolved by discussion. Data were synthesised using the random effects model and expressed as relative risk (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI).</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Fourteen unique trials with 1497 randomised participants were included. Antifungal prophylaxis did not reduce mortality (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.44). In liver transplant recipients, a significant reduction in IFIs was demonstrated for fluconazole (RR 0.28, 95% CI 0.13 to 0.57). Although less data were available for itraconazole and liposomal amphotericin B, indirect comparisons and one direct comparative trial suggested similar efficacy. Fluconazole prophylaxis did not significantly increase invasive infections or colonisation with fluconazole-resistant fungi. In renal and cardiac transplant recipients, neither ketoconazole nor clotrimazole significantly reduced invasive infections. Overall, the strength and precision of comparisons however were limited by a paucity of data.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>For liver transplant recipients, antifungal prophylaxis with fluconazole significantly reduces the incidence of IFIs with no definite mortality benefit. Given a 10% incidence of IFI, 14 liver transplant recipients would require fluconazole prophylaxis to prevent one infection. In transplant centres where the incidence of IFIs is high, or in situations where the individual risk is great, antifungal prophylaxis should be considered.</P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2008-09-16 13:18:02 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-09-16 13:17:57 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<P>Invasive fungal infections (IFIs) are an emerging problem and an important cause of morbidity and mortality amongst the increasing populations of immunocompromised and otherwise debilitated patients. Amongst North American hospitalised patients their incidence increased from 2.0 to 3.8 infections/1000 discharges during the decade 1980 to 1990 (<LINK REF="REF-Beck_x002d_Sague-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beck-Sague 1993</LINK>).</P>
<P>Patient groups at particular risk for IFIs include those with cancer that have undergone chemotherapy and/or bone marrow transplantation, solid organ transplant recipients, critically-ill patients in Intensive Care Units, and very low birth weight neonates. Amongst solid organ transplant recipients, IFIs remain a relatively common and clinically important complication. The risk is greatest during the early post-transplant period (<LINK REF="REF-Singh-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Singh 2000</LINK>) and varies with transplant type; liver (7 to 42%), heart (5 to 21%), lung (15 to 35%), and pancreas (18 to 38%) transplant recipients are at greater risk than renal transplant recipients (1 to 14%) (<LINK REF="REF-Paya-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Paya 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Singh-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Singh 2000</LINK>). Many other risk factors for the development of IFIs have also been identified, including hepatic and renal dysfunction, retransplantation, greater degrees of immunosuppression, surgical complications, and post-transplant bacterial or cytomegalovirus infections (<LINK REF="REF-Castaldo-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Castaldo 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-George-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">George 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nieto_x002d_Rodriguez-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nieto-Rodriguez 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Paya-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Paya 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Patel-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Patel 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Paterson-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Paterson 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Singh-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Singh 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>Although a wide range of fungal pathogens cause IFIs in solid organ transplant recipients, <I>Candida</I> and <I>Aspergillus</I> species account for the vast majority, with the former causing more than three-quarters (<LINK REF="REF-Singh-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Singh 2000</LINK>). They include bloodstream and other deep organ infections, such as peritonitis, hepatosplenic candidiasis, meningitis, and pneumonia. Invasive aspergillosis generally presents within the first four weeks following transplantation. The lungs are the most common initial site of infection, although dissemination to other organs, particularly the brain, occurs in more than half (<LINK REF="REF-Paterson-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Paterson 1999</LINK>). The clinical consequences of IFIs in solid organ transplant recipients are considerable, with attributable mortality rates reported as high as 70% for invasive candidiasis (<LINK REF="REF-Nieto_x002d_Rodriguez-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nieto-Rodriguez 1996</LINK>) and 100% for invasive aspergillosis despite antifungal therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Paterson-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Paterson 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>IFIs are often diagnosed late because of their nonspecific clinical features and the poor sensitivity and specificity of currently available diagnostic tests. Given the high mortality and morbidity associated with such infections, particularly where the institution of antifungal therapy is delayed, attention has focused on preventative strategies. Antifungal prophylaxis with amphotericin B, fluconazole, and itraconazole reduces IFIs in neutropenic patients (<LINK REF="REF-Gotzsche-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gotzsche 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kanda-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kanda 2000</LINK>). In these settings, antifungal prophylaxis has become a standard strategy in high-risk neutropenic patients. However, the benefit of antifungal prophylaxis in high-risk non-neutropenic patients remains uncertain (<LINK REF="REF-Paya-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Paya 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Singh-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Singh 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sobel-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sobel 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>The prophylactic use of antifungal agents is associated with actual and potential problems. Although several antifungal agents are available, the choice is not straightforward, as each has differing spectra of activity, pharmacological properties, toxicities, and costs. Amphotericin B is active against a broad spectrum of fungi, but requires intravenous administration and is associated with renal toxicity and infusion-related febrile reactions. Although lipid preparations of amphotericin B have reduced toxicity (<LINK REF="REF-Johansen-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johansen 2002</LINK>), they are significantly more expensive. Azole antifungal agents, such as ketoconazole, fluconazole, and itraconazole, may be administered orally and are overall well tolerated, but have important interactions with many drugs, particularly immunosuppressant agents commonly used in solid organ transplantation. Furthermore, ketoconazole and fluconazole are inactive against <I>Aspergillus</I> species and other filamentous fungi and itraconazole has poor gastrointestinal absorption. Nonabsorbable antifungal agents given by the oral route, such as amphotericin B and nystatin, are relatively nontoxic. Although their use is based on the rationale that the most invasive C<I>andida</I> infections are derived from the gastrointestinal tract colonisation (<LINK REF="REF-Nucci-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nucci 2001</LINK>), they have no activity against other important portals of entry, such as the skin or respiratory tract.</P>
<P>An important potential problem of antifungal prophylaxis relates to selective pressure, whereby susceptible strains or species of fungi are simply replaced by resistant ones. This phenomenon is well-recognised in bacteria as a consequence of antibiotic use (<LINK REF="REF-McGowan-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">McGowan 1983</LINK>). There is some evidence that increases in azole-resistant invasive candida infections have resulted from increases in azole use (<LINK REF="REF-Abi_x002d_Said-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Abi-Said 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fortun-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fortun 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gleason-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gleason 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nguyen-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nguyen 1996</LINK>). In HIV-positive patients, thrush with azole-resistant candida strains and species has been selected for by azole use (<LINK REF="REF-Johnson-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnson 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Law-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Law 1994</LINK>). Thus, antifungal prophylaxis in solid organ transplant recipients requires consideration of toxicity, ecological effects, resistance selection, and cost, as well as efficacy.</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>To evaluate the benefits and harms of prophylactic antifungal agents for the prevention of fungal infections in solid organ transplant recipients. <BR/>The following primary questions were examined: <BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Is prophylaxis with any antifungal agent(s) associated with reduced IFIs and mortality compared with no prophylaxis? </LI>
<LI>Are some agent(s) alone or in combination more efficacious than others? </LI>
<LI>For each agent, does the efficacy depend upon dose, route of administration, and duration of prophylaxis? </LI>
<LI>Do some patient subgroups derive greater benefit from antifungal prophylaxis than others? </LI>
</UL>
<P>
<BR/>Secondary questions were examined: <BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Is antifungal prophylaxis associated with reduced superficial fungal infections?</LI>
<LI>Is antifungal prophylaxis associated with colonisation or infection with azole-resistant fungal strains or species? </LI>
<LI>Is prophylaxis with antifungal agent(s) associated with clinically-significant toxicity? </LI>

<CRIT_STUDIES>
<P>All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs that evaluate the effect of any prophylactic antifungal agent (alone or in combination with other interventions) in solid organ transplant recipients.</P>
</CRIT_STUDIES>
<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>Studies involving patients who have received one or more solid organ transplants (heart, lung, kidney, liver, or pancreas) were considered. Studies involving patients with neutropenia or HIV-infected patients were excluded; the former patient group has already been the subject of a systematic review and the latter involves a different spectrum of fungal infections. Where studies include solid organ transplant recipients, together with neutropenic and/or HIV-infected patients, they were included, providing the proportion of the latter groups is less than 25%. </P>
</CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>Studies were considered if they involved the randomised comparison of any antifungal agent with placebo, no antifungal, or another antifungal agent, dose, route of administration, or duration.</P>
<P>The study groups were required to differ only for the antifungal regimen under investigation; other aspects of care, including the routine use of other prophylactic antimicrobial agents, should be the same to avoid confounded comparisons. Secondary "prevention" trials (i.e. trials examining antifungal agents to prevent the relapse of an established fungal infection) were not considered, as the objective of this review was to assess interventions to prevent primary fungal infections. </P>

<P>Subgroup analysis was performed to assess the influence of study methodology quality and clinical parameters (such as type of antifungal agent, dose and duration of prophylaxis, transplant type, outcome measure definition, and follow-up duration). Although variations in treatment effect may be explained by differences in the background risk of developing IFIs, assessing this variation through the simple relationship between the observed treatment effect and the observed background risk in individual studies is flawed (<LINK REF="REF-Davey-Smith-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davey Smith 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sharp-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sharp 2001</LINK>).</P>

<P>From the initial search strategy (1926 potential studies), 114 studies were identified as potentially relevant and retrieved for further assessment (<LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>). Although pharmaceutical companies provided some information, no unique studies were identified from that source. No useable data or information regarding one potentially eligible study (<LINK REF="STD-Rossi-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Rossi 1995</LINK>), available only as an abstract, other than its title was able to be retrieved despite extensive efforts, including contact with the corresponding author.</P>

All studies were in English. One study was available only as an abstract (<LINK REF="STD-Meyers-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Meyers 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>Eleven trials evaluated systemic antifungal agents. Ten trials compared a systemic antifungal regimen with placebo, no antifungal, or an oral nonabsorbable agent: four involved fluconazole (<LINK REF="STD-Lumbreras-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Lumbreras 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Meyers-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Meyers 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tortorano-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Tortorano 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Winston-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Winston 1999</LINK>), two itraconazole (<LINK REF="STD-Biancofiore-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Biancofiore 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sharpe-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Sharpe 2003</LINK>), one liposomal amphotericin B (<LINK REF="STD-Tollemar-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Tollemar 1995</LINK>), and three ketoconazole (<LINK REF="STD-Keogh-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Keogh 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Patton-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Patton 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sobh-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Sobh 1995</LINK>). One study directly compared two systemic regimens: fluconazole versus itraconazole (<LINK REF="STD-Winston-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Winston 2002</LINK>). Additionally, one of the placebo-controlled studies compared two different itraconazole-based regimens with placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Biancofiore-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Biancofiore 2002</LINK>), which we assessed both separately and together. Three studies evaluated only oral nonabsorbable agents: one compared clotrimazole with placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Owens-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Owens 1984</LINK>) and two compared clotrimazole with nystatin (<LINK REF="STD-Gombert-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Gombert 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ruskin-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Ruskin 1992</LINK>).

<P>Reporting of outcomes was variable (<LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>; <LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK>). Total mortality was reported for all but one of the trials assessing systemic antifungal agents (<LINK REF="STD-Sobh-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Sobh 1995</LINK>), but none of those assessing only nonabsorbable agents. Eleven trials reported proven IFIs, with the diagnostic criteria for this outcome provided in six of these. The reported criteria was consistent with our definition in six (<LINK REF="STD-Lumbreras-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Lumbreras 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sharpe-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Sharpe 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tollemar-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Tollemar 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tortorano-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Tortorano 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Winston-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Winston 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Winston-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Winston 2002</LINK>), but not in the other which included positive cultures from three or more peripheral sites as evidence of an invasive infection (<LINK REF="STD-Biancofiore-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Biancofiore 2002</LINK>), which we would regard as consistent with either colonisation or superficial infection. Of the four trials without explicit criteria, three provided sufficient information in the results to classify infections (<LINK REF="STD-Owens-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Owens 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Patton-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Patton 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sobh-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Sobh 1995</LINK>), but not the other, which was presented only in abstract form (<LINK REF="STD-Meyers-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Meyers 1997</LINK>).

Other outcomes were even more variably reported, particularly with respect to the fungal species causing infection and/or colonisation. Overall, most data were available for the fluconazole trials.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Total mortality</HEADING>
<P>Total mortality rates in the control arms of the trials ranged from 3 to 16% (mean, 12%). Total mortality was not reduced with any systemic antifungal regimen compared with placebo, no treatment, or nonabsorbable antifungal agents. Results were homogeneous across different antifungal agents and transplant types (&#967; = 9.01, df = 8, P = 0.34, <I>I</I> = 11.3%) . Pooled estimates for all trials combined (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>: RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.44) and for those in liver transplant recipients combined (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.30) did not demonstrate a significant mortality benefit, although confidence intervals were wide.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Proven invasive fungal infections (IFIs)</HEADING>
<P>Fluconazole significantly reduced the risk of proven IFIs in liver transplant recipients compared with placebo or nonabsorbable antifungal agents by about three-quarters (<LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>
<U>.1</U>: RR 0.28, 95% CI 0.13 to 0.57). The overall rate of proven infections in the control arm of these four studies was 13% (range 4 to 23%). Despite differences in the prophylactic regimens, such as dose, route of administration, and duration, the relative risk reductions across these studies were homogeneous (&#967; = 1.04, df= 3, P = 0.79; <I>I</I> = 0%).<BR/>
<BR/>Proven IFIs were reported to occur in only one of the two itraconazole trials: in this, no significant reduction in infections was demonstrated, although confidence intervals were wide (<LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>
<U>.2</U>: RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.44 to 1.45).</P>
<P>Liposomal amphotericin B prevented all proven invasive infections in one trial in liver transplant recipients, but similarly confidence intervals were very wide (<LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>
<U>.3</U>: RR 0.07, 95% CI 0.00 to 1.26).</P>
<P>No significantly heterogeneity was demonstrated amongst the seven studies that compared fluconazole, itraconazole, or amphotericin B with no antifungal or a nonabsorbable antifungal agent in liver transplant recipients (&#967; = 8.44, df = 5, P = 0.13, I = 40.7%). This suggests a similar underlying efficacy for the prevention of proven IFIs in such patients, which is not critically dependent on the antifungal agent, dose, duration, or route of administration (pooled estimate, RR 0.39, 95% CI 0.18 to 0.85).</P>
<P>Ketoconazole did not significantly reduce infections in the single study in renal transplant recipients (RR 7.67, 95% CI 0.32 to 182.44) and that in cardiac transplant recipients (RR 0.43, 95% CI 0.09 to 2.93), although only a total of seven infections occurred amongst 137 randomised patients in these two trials.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Proven or suspected invasive fungal infections</HEADING>
<P>Fluconazole prophylaxis reduced the incidence of combined proven and suspected IFIs (<LINK REF="CMP-001.07" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.7</LINK>
<U>.1</U>: RR 0.46, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.76). The incidence of suspected invasive infections (empiric antifungal use) ranged from 3% to 8% in the control arms of these trials and was not significantly reduced by fluconazole prophylaxis. In the single itraconazole study reporting this outcome, the incidence of suspected infections was not significantly reduced (<LINK REF="CMP-001.07" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.7</LINK>
<U>.2</U>: RR 0.25, 95% CI 0.03 to 1.93). Similarly, liposomal amphotericin B did not significantly reduce the incidence of suspected infections (<LINK REF="CMP-001.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.6</LINK>
<U>.3</U>: RR 1.27, 95% CI 0.30 to 5.34) or that of suspected and proven infections combined (<LINK REF="CMP-001.07" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.7</LINK>
<U>.3</U>: RR 0.42, 95% CI 0.14 to 1.27). However, for both of these studies, the confidence intervals were wide.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Superficial fungal infections</HEADING>
<P>Fluconazole significantly reduced superficial fungal infections in liver transplant recipients (<LINK REF="CMP-001.08" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.8</LINK>
<U>.1</U>: RR 0.24, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.59). Amongst these three studies, the overall rate of superficial fungal infections was 29% (range, 25% to 31%), with no significant heterogeneity in the effect of fluconazole prophylaxis demonstrated (&#967; = 3.9, df = 2, P = 0.14, <I>I</I> = 48.8%). No superficial infections occurred in the itraconazole arm of the single trial reporting this outcome. Amongst renal transplant recipients, ketoconazole reduced superficial infections (RR 0.19, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.86), although the rate of superficial infections in the control groups of these two studies were considerably different (18% and 64%) and heterogeneity was demonstrated between them (&#967; = 2.83, df = 1, P = 0.09, I = 64.7%). In the single study of ketoconazole in cardiac transplant recipients, all superficial infections were prevented.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Fungal colonisation</HEADING>
<P>Fluconazole reduced fungal colonisation in liver transplant recipients (<LINK REF="CMP-001.09" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.9</LINK>
<U>.1</U>: RR 0.47, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.61). Results were homogeneous across the three trials reporting this outcome (&#967; = 1.58, df = 2, P = 0.45, I = 0%). Itraconazole prophylaxis similarly reduced colonisation (<LINK REF="CMP-001.09" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.9</LINK>

<P>Invasive infections with <I>C. glabrata</I>, <I>C. krusei</I>, or moulds were reported in three fluconazole trials, causing 6% and 3% of invasive infections in the control and fluconazole arms respectively. No significant increase in their incidence was associated with fluconazole (<LINK REF="CMP-001.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.5</LINK>
<U>.1</U>:RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.19 to 1.33). Based on single studies, no significant increases were associated with itraconazole (<LINK REF="CMP-001.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.5</LINK>
<U>.2</U>:RR 5.76, 95% CI 0.33 to 101.77), liposomal amphotericin B (<LINK REF="CMP-001.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.5</LINK>

<P>Fungal colonisation with <I>C. glabrata</I> or <I>C. krusei</I> was reported in three fluconazole trials and occurred in 7% of patients in the control arms and 16% in the fluconazole arms.

</INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>This meta-analysis demonstrates that antifungal prophylaxis with fluconazole reduces IFIs in liver transplant recipients by about three-quarters although only one of four trials individually demonstrated a significant effect, the other three yielded a similar but non-significant benefit. Furthermore, the efficacy of fluconazole was remarkably consistent across the studies despite considerable clinical heterogeneity (including differences in dose, duration, and route of administration of fluconazole as well as the comparator and underlying risk of infection) and methodological heterogeneity (including differences in diagnostic criteria and reported study methodological parameters). This suggests that the pooled estimates are robust and generalizable to a diverse range of clinical settings. Assuming an overall average 10% incidence of IFI in liver transplant recipients (<LINK REF="REF-Fung-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fung 2002</LINK>), 14 patients would require fluconazole prophylaxis to prevent one infection (<LINK REF="TBL-05" TYPE="TABLE">Table 5</LINK>). For lower risk recipients, with an approximate 5% incidence, this would increase to 28 patients. However, for highest risk patients, such as those undergoing retransplantation, and/or those with fulminant hepatitis, preoperative immunosuppressive therapy, operative or infective complications, with a risk of fungal infections around 25% (<LINK REF="REF-Collins-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Collins 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-George-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">George 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Patel-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Patel 1996</LINK>), only six patients would require prophylaxis to prevent one fungal infection (<LINK REF="TBL-05" TYPE="TABLE">Table 5</LINK>).</P>
<P>Itraconazole and liposomal amphotericin B both have broader antifungal spectra than fluconazole. Although neither agent demonstrated a significant reduction in invasive infections (based on only three studies), their efficacies are likely to be similar to that of fluconazole. The results of the single study directly comparing itraconazole with fluconazole reinforce this finding. No direct comparisons of liposomal amphotericin B with other antifungals are available, although one study comparing liposomal amphotericin B with fluconazole for one initial week - each then followed by itraconazole for three weeks - demonstrated no significant difference (<LINK REF="STD-Winston-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Winston 2002</LINK>). Recently marketed systemic antifungal agents, such as caspofungin and voriconazole, offer potential advantages, such as wider spectrum of activity, improved pharmacological properties, and greater safety, however no data are available regarding their prophylactic efficacy. Given the demonstrated efficacy of fluconazole, the justification for the use of such broader-spectrum agents depends on the incidence of infections with fluconazole-resistant pathogens. However from the trials reviewed here and from other reports (<LINK REF="REF-Singh-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Singh 2000</LINK>), such infections account for 25% or less of all invasive infections in solid organ transplant recipients.</P>
<P>The significant reduction in IFIs in liver transplant recipients with antifungal prophylaxis has not been confirmed in other settings, such as heart, lung, or pancreas recipients, because of a lack of formal evaluation in RCTs. Three trials, designed principally to assess the cyclosporine-sparing effect of ketoconazole in cardiac and renal transplant recipients, were available, did not demonstrate a significant reduction in invasive infections. Although wide confidence intervals reflected a very low event rate, poor bioavailability and a lack of demonstrated efficacy in neutropenic patients (<LINK REF="REF-Gotzsche-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gotzsche 2002</LINK>), would suggest little benefit for ketoconazole. Similarly, despite limited data, nonabsorbable agents are unlikely to be effective (<LINK REF="REF-Gotzsche-2002a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gotzsche 2002a</LINK>). </P>
<P>Given the significant reduction in IFIs and their high attributable mortality, the lack of significant mortality benefit associated with antifungal prophylaxis is noteworthy. As the number of available studies was limited, this result may reflect type II error. However, there are other possible explanations for this finding. Patients at risk of fungal infections most likely share risks for other serious complications and may have died from other causes. It is also possible that any mortality benefit provided by antifungal prophylaxis was matched by the institution of early empirical antifungal therapy in the control arm. The overall results are consistent with those in neutropenic patients, where despite similar reductions in IFIs, no significant mortality benefit was demonstrated for fluconazole or itraconazole, and only a marginal benefit was demonstrated for amphotericin B (<LINK REF="REF-Gotzsche-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gotzsche 2002</LINK>). Although concerns regarding possible increased mortality associated with fluconazole prophylaxis in bone marrow transplant recipients have been raised (<LINK REF="REF-Gotzsche-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gotzsche 2002</LINK>), there was no evidence of this amongst solid organ transplant recipients. A reduction in fungal-related mortality has been reported in a meta-analysis of fluconazole prophylaxis in neutropenic patients (<LINK REF="REF-Kanda-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kanda 2000</LINK>). We did not assess this outcome, as we, like others (<LINK REF="REF-Gotzsche-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gotzsche 2002</LINK>), considered the attribution of deaths to fungal infections too imprecise and subjective, and therefore prone to bias, particularly in studies without blinded outcome assessors. </P>
<P>The selection of resistant fungal species is a major potential adverse consequence of widespread prophylactic antifungal use. Certain <I>Candida</I> species, such as <I>C. glabrata</I> and <I>C. krusei,</I> and most moulds, including <I>Aspergillus</I> species, are intrinsically fluconazole-resistant. The <I>de novo</I> development of fluconazole-resistance amongst susceptible species and the emergence of intrinsically resistant species have been associated with its use (<LINK REF="REF-Law-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Law 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Johnson-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnson 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nguyen-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nguyen 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Abi_x002d_Said-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Abi-Said 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fortun-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fortun 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gleason-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gleason 1997</LINK>). Amongst the three fluconazole studies containing sufficient information, no increase in fluconazole-resistant fungal infections was demonstrated, although only eight infections with fluconazole-resistant <I>Candida</I> spp. and ten with moulds were reported. However, all three trials reported an increase, albeit non-significant, in colonisation with <I>C. glabrata</I> and <I>C. krusei</I>. The confidence intervals around the point estimates were very wide, reflecting the relatively small event rate. Thus, given the relatively small sample sizes in these studies, a significant effect of fluconazole on the either the spectrum of fungal species or their antifungal susceptibility cannot be excluded. Further studies involving the characterisation and susceptibility testing of fungal isolates, an appropriate timeframe, and sufficient statistical power are therefore required.</P>
<P>The major limitation of this systematic review is the relatively small number of trials and their small sample sizes causing imprecision of pooled estimates. We sought to maximise our study retrieval by employing a comprehensive search strategy encompassing the major computerised databases without language restriction, major conference proceedings, and review articles. Unpublished studies ('grey literature') were also sought despite the potential for inflated estimates of intervention efficacy (<LINK REF="REF-McAuley-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">McAuley 2000</LINK>). We also approached major pharmaceutical companies marketing antifungal agents, but identified no additional or unpublished studies. Publication bias was recognised previously in trials of antifungal prophylaxis in neutropenic patients (<LINK REF="REF-Johansen-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johansen 1999</LINK>). Examination of funnel plots for systemic antifungal agents versus control shows asymmetry around the point estimate of effect (<LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>; <LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK>), which may indicate publication bias. </P>
<P>The reporting of methodological quality of studies in this review was generally suboptimal. Allocation concealment, an important potential source of bias if inadequate (<LINK REF="REF-Schultz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schultz 1995</LINK>), was adequate in only one study. IFIs are often diagnosed with at least some degree of uncertainty and subjectivity. Blinding of outcome assessors with respect to treatment allocation would therefore be an important precaution to minimise bias, although this was reportedly taken in only two studies. Despite progress toward standardisation (<LINK REF="REF-Ascioglu-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ascioglu 2002</LINK>), a varied - and often conflicting - range of diagnostic criteria for IFIs have been published (<LINK REF="REF-Ascioglu-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ascioglu 2001</LINK>). This problem was evident amongst the studies reviewed here. We therefore, wherever possible, restricted the diagnosis to patients with compatible clinical features in whom fungi were demonstrated in blood or deep tissue specimens by histopathology and/or culture. We classified uncomplicated funguria and fungal oesophagitis as superficial, not invasive, infections. However one trial included positive cultures of nonsterile specimens as evidence of invasive infections and another did not provide either the criteria or sufficient details to allow independent classification. Despite these shortcomings in reported study methodology, they did not appear to obviously influence the direction or magnitude of trial results.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>Our results demonstrate that antifungal prophylaxis, particularly with fluconazole, is effective in preventing IFIs in liver transplant recipients. Although the optimal dose and duration of prophylaxis remains uncertain, it should be considered particularly for high-risk patients or in centres experiencing a high rate of IFIs. Given that the risk of fungal infections in transplant recipients varies from patient-to-patient, prophylaxis would be logically applied selectively and individually according to that risk, rather than universally. </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Many risk factors for fungal infections have been defined and could be incorporated into decisions regarding prophylaxis. A more detailed risk assessment associated with cost-effectiveness analyses of antifungal prophylaxis will further rationalise decisions on antifungal prophylaxis. To that end, studies modelling the risk factors for IFIs amongst solid organ transplant recipients with examination of their clinical and economic consequences are required. Studies of newer antifungal agents or of prophylaxis in other organ transplant recipients should be specifically targeted to patients at increased risk. Such studies should incorporate standardised definitions of IFIs and basic methodological quality measures.</P>
<P>The potential for selection or generation of resistance to antifungal agents amongst fungal pathogens remains a major concern associated with antifungal use. Further study is required to quantify the occurrence and consequences of such ecological effects before the prophylactic use of antifungal agents can be more widely recommended. </P>
