<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2013-06-25 09:24:20 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Bleeding after childbirth (postpartum haemorrhage) is the leading cause of maternal deaths in Sub-Saharan Africa and Egypt, and yet it is largely preventable. Possible causes of heavy bleeding directly following childbirth or within the first 24 hours are that the uterus fails to contract after delivery (uterine atony), a retained placenta, inverted or ruptured uterus, and cervical, vaginal, or perineal tears.</P>
<P>In well-resourced settings haemorrhage is reduced by routine active management of delivery of the placenta, called the third stage of labour, using a drug to stimulate contraction of the uterus such as oxytocin. Uterine massage after delivery of the placenta can also promote contraction of the uterus. This involves placing a hand on the woman's lower abdomen and stimulating the uterus by repetitive massaging or squeezing movements.</P>
<P>This review included two controlled trials in which women were randomly assigned to receive uterine massage or no massage with active management of the third stage of labour, including the routine use of oxytocin.</P>
<P>In one trial involving 200 women, uterine massage was given every 10 minutes for 60 minutes after delivery of the placenta effectively reduced blood loss, and the need for additional uterotonics, by some 80%. The numbers of women losing more than 500 mL of blood were too small for meaningful comparison. Two women in the control group and none in the uterine massage group needed blood transfusions.</P>
<P>The second trial involved 1964 women who were assigned to receive oxytocin, uterine massage or both after delivery of the baby and before delivery of the placenta. There was no added benefit for uterine massage when oxytocin was used.</P>
<P>The results of this review are inconclusive. The methodological quality of the two included trials was high but it is possible that there were differences in the procedures used in the study sites. Disadvantages of uterine massage include the use of staff time, and discomfort caused to women. The findings should not change the recommended practice. It is likely that any reduction in blood loss was limited with the use of oxytocin in these trials. Uterine massage may also have increased apparent blood loss by pressing pooled blood out from the uterine cavity. There is a need for more trials, especially in settings where uterotonics are not available. Uterine massage could be a simple inexpensive intervention if proved effective.</P>

<P>Postpartum haemorrhage (PPH) (bleeding from the genital tract after childbirth) is a major cause of maternal mortality and disability, particularly in under-resourced areas. In these settings, uterotonics are often not accessible. There is a need for simple, inexpensive techniques which can be applied in low-resourced settings to prevent and treat PPH. Uterine massage is recommended as part of the routine active management of the third stage of labour. However, it is not known whether it is effective. If shown to be effective, uterine massage would represent a simple intervention with the potential to have a major effect on PPH and maternal mortality in under-resourced settings.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-06-24 21:37:39 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review included two randomised controlled trials. The first trial included 200 women who were randomised to receive uterine massage or no massage following delivery of the placenta, after active management of the third stage of labour including use of oxytocin. The numbers of women with blood loss more than 500 mL was small, with no statistically significant difference (risk ratio (RR) 0.52, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.16 to 1.67). There were no cases of retained placenta in either group. The mean blood loss was significantly less in the uterine massage group at 30 minutes (mean difference (MD) -41.60 mL, 95% CI -75.16 to -8.04) and 60 minutes after trial entry (MD -77.40 mL, 95% CI -118.71 to -36.09). The need for additional uterotonics was significantly reduced in the uterine massage group (RR 0.20, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.50).</P>
<P>For use of uterine massage before and after delivery of the placenta, one trial recruited 1964 women in Egypt and South Africa. Women were assigned to receive oxytocin, uterine massage or both after delivery of the baby but before delivery of the placenta. There was no added benefit for uterine massage plus oxytocin over oxytocin alone as regards blood loss greater than or equal to 500 mL (average RR 1.56, 95% CI 0.44, 5.49; random-effects) or need for additional use of uterotonics (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.85).</P>
<P>The two trials were combined to examine the effect of uterine massage commenced either before or after delivery of the placenta. There was substantial heterogeneity with respect to the blood loss 500 mL or more after trial entry. The average effect using a random-effects model found no statistically significant differences between groups (average RR 1.14, 95% CI 0.39 to 3.32; random-effects).</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2012-12-06 11:40:09 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The results of this review are inconclusive, and should not be interpreted as a reason to change current practice. Due to the limitations of the included trials, more trials with sufficient numbers of women are needed in order to estimate the effects of sustained uterine massage. All the women compared in this review received oxytocin as part of the active management of labour. Recent research suggests that once an oxytocic has been given, there is limited scope for further reduction in postpartum blood loss. Trials of uterine massage in settings where uterotonics are not available, and which measure women's experience of the procedure, are needed.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2013-06-12 16:59:14 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Postpartum haemorrhage (PPH) (excessive bleeding from the genital tract after childbirth) is a major cause of maternal mortality and disability, particularly in under-resourced areas (<LINK REF="REF-Fawcus-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fawcus 1995</LINK>). It is the leading cause of maternal mortality in Sub-Saharan Africa (<LINK REF="REF-Lazarus-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lazarus 2005</LINK>). The South African National Committee for the Confidential Enquiries into Maternal Deaths analysed 3406 reported maternal deaths for the years 2002 to 2004. Overall, 9.5% were due to PPH (<LINK REF="REF-NCCEMD-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">NCCEMD 2006</LINK>). In Egypt, in spite of the drop in maternal mortality ratio from 174/100,000 live births in 1992 to 1993 to 80/100,000 live births in the year 2000 (<LINK REF="REF-MOH-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">MOH 2000</LINK>), PPH is still the leading cause and responsible for 34% of maternal deaths.</P>
<P>Deaths from PPH remain most common in areas where access to health services is poorest. In these settings, poor nutrition, malaria and anaemia may aggravate the effects of PPH. In well-resourced settings with healthier populations and adequate health services, deaths from PPH are extremely rare, as effective methods are available to reduce and treat PPH. These include routine active management of the third stage of labour and facilities for resuscitation, blood transfusion and surgical interventions. In the 2002 to 2004 South African National Confidential Enquiry into Maternal Deaths, 83% of the 313 deaths from PPH were found to be 'clearly preventable' (<LINK REF="REF-NCCEMD-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">NCCEMD 2006</LINK>). For these reasons, strategies to reduce deaths from PPH have been a focus of attempts to achieve the Millennium Development Goal of reducing maternal mortality by 75% by 2015.<BR/>
<BR/>Primary PPH, heavy bleeding directly following childbirth or within 24 hours thereafter, is the most common type of PPH and can be caused by uterine atony, retained placenta, inverted or ruptured uterus, and cervical, vaginal, or perineal lacerations. Uterine atony, when the uterus fails to contract after delivery, is the most important cause of primary PPH (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2000</LINK>). Methods leading to contraction of the uterus and correction of atony will reduce the amount of bleeding after delivery.</P>
<P>Recommendations for the prevention of PPH such as the joint statement of the International Confederation of Midwives and the International Federation of Gynaecologists and Obstetricians (<LINK REF="REF-ICM_x002f_FIGO-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">ICM/FIGO 2004</LINK>) recommend routine massage of the uterus after delivery of the placenta. Uterine massage involves placing a hand on the woman's lower abdomen and stimulating the uterus by repetitive massaging or squeezing movements. Massage is thought to stimulate uterine contraction, possibly through stimulation of local prostaglandin release and thus to reduce haemorrhage. However, it is not done routinely after delivery in a systematic way. If shown to be effective, it would have important advantages as it is inexpensive and requires no access to medication or other specialised services, and could be used in any location in which women give birth. Disadvantages include the use of staff time, and discomfort caused to women. However, there is very little empirical research to evaluate the effectiveness of this method. There is therefore a need to evaluate systematically the effectiveness of uterine massage for preventing PPH.</P>

<P>Two trials are included in this review. <LINK REF="STD-Abdel_x002d_Aleem-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Abdel-Aleem 2006</LINK> is a small randomised trial conducted in a teaching hospital located in a developing country (Egypt). The other study (<LINK REF="REF-Abdel_x002d_Aleem-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Abdel-Aleem 2010</LINK>) is a larger trial from the same group conducted in teaching hospitals in Egypt and South Africa. For the purposes of this review, the data for each site for the latter trial are presented separately due to heterogeneity between sites. In our analyses, the data are included as <LINK REF="STD-Abdel_x002d_Aleem-2010-Egypt" TYPE="STUDY">Abdel-Aleem 2010 Egypt</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Abdel_x002d_Aleem-2010-S-Africa" TYPE="STUDY">Abdel-Aleem 2010 S Africa</LINK>. In both trials, women were randomly allocated to receive uterine massage or no massage after active management of the third stage of labour, including the routine use of oxytocin 10 units. Uterine massage was commenced before (<LINK REF="STD-Abdel_x002d_Aleem-2010-Egypt" TYPE="STUDY">Abdel-Aleem 2010 Egypt</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Abdel_x002d_Aleem-2010-S-Africa" TYPE="STUDY">Abdel-Aleem 2010 S Africa</LINK>) or after delivery of the placenta (<LINK REF="STD-Abdel_x002d_Aleem-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Abdel-Aleem 2006</LINK>). The first trial (<LINK REF="STD-Abdel_x002d_Aleem-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Abdel-Aleem 2006</LINK>) recruited 200 women assigned at random to receive uterine massage or no massage after delivery of the placenta, in addition to active management of the third stage of labour. The second trial (<LINK REF="STD-Abdel_x002d_Aleem-2010-Egypt" TYPE="STUDY">Abdel-Aleem 2010 Egypt</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Abdel_x002d_Aleem-2010-S-Africa" TYPE="STUDY">Abdel-Aleem 2010 S Africa</LINK>) included 1964 women, assigned randomly to receive one of three interventions after delivery of the baby and before delivery of the placenta. These interventions were oxytocin (10 IU), uterine massage, or both. In this review we include only the oxytocin versus both oxytocin and uterine massage groups (i.e. uterine massage versus no uterine massage with oxytocin as a co-intervention in both groups).</P>

<P>There was substantial heterogeneity with respect to the proportion of women with blood loss greater than or equal to 500 mL (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>). The average effect found no statistically significant difference between groups (average risk ratio (RR) 1.56, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.44, 5.49; random-effects).

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2012-12-23 11:31:24 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>One small trial found evidence of reduced blood loss with uterine massage after placental delivery. However, overall, the trials do not provide compelling evidence of the effectiveness of uterine massage.</P>
<P>The heterogeneity between trials and sites is cause for cautious interpretation of the results of this review. The heterogeneity raises the possibility that differences in trial procedures between sites may affect the results. For example, it is possible that uterine massage may express blood from the uterine cavity, while in the control group pooled blood in the uterine cavity is not measured, leading to a relative under-estimation of blood loss. This could mask a beneficial effect of uterine massage. This effect is suggested by the fact that in the South African site (<LINK REF="STD-Abdel_x002d_Aleem-2010-S-Africa" TYPE="STUDY">Abdel-Aleem 2010 S Africa</LINK>), measured blood loss was significantly more in the uterine massage group, yet there was a trend to higher haemoglobin levels at 12 to 24 hours. In view of these uncertainties, the results of this review should be regarded as inconclusive.</P>
<P>The data reviewed included only women who had received routine uterotonics. In this situation, it is likely that their uteri were optimally contracted, and the potential for further benefit from uterine massage was limited.</P>
<P>These results should therefore not be extrapolated to settings where routine uterotonics are not used or not available.</P>
<P>There were no data on women's experience of discomfort during the procedure.</P>

<P>The joint statement of <LINK REF="REF-ICM_x002f_FIGO-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">ICM/FIGO 2004</LINK> on management of the third stage of labour, advises uterine massage after delivery of the placenta to prevent postpartum haemorrhage. The results of this review are inconclusive, and should not be interpreted as a reason to change current practice.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2013-06-12 17:05:50 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>It is remarkable that a practice, which has been widespread for decades, has been subjected to so little formal research. Further research to determine the effectiveness of uterine massage should be a high priority, especially as it is an intervention that can be used in any setting, particularly where uterotonics are not available. Such trials should include an assessment of women's views. Due to the limitations of the included trials, trials with sufficient numbers to estimate the effects of sustained uterine massage with greater precision, particularly with respect to objective outcomes such as postpartum anaemia, are needed. In particular, trials of uterine massage in settings where uterotonics are not available are of great importance. Recent research suggests that once an oxytocic has been given, as was the case in the studies included in this review, there is limited scope for further reduction in postpartum blood loss (<LINK REF="REF-Widmer-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Widmer 2010</LINK>). In settings with no access to uterotonics, the potential for uterine massage to reduce blood loss may differ from that when uterotonics are used. If shown to be effective, uterine massage would represent a simple intervention with the potential to have a major effect on postpartum haemorrhage and maternal mortality in under-resourced settings.</P>

<APPENDIX_BODY MODIFIED="2013-06-12 17:12:32 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The following methods were used to assess <LINK REF="STD-Abdel_x002d_Aleem-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Abdel-Aleem 2006</LINK>.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Selection of studies</HEADING>
<P>We assessed for inclusion all potential studies identified as a result of the search strategy. We resolved any disagreement through discussion or, if required, consulted an outside person.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Data extraction and management</HEADING>
<P>We designed a form to extract data. The review authors extracted the data using the agreed form. Discrepancies were resolved through discussion. The Review Manager software (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2008</LINK>) was used to double enter all the data.</P>
<P>When information regarding any of the above was unclear, we attempted to contact authors of the original reports to provide further details.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Assessment of methodological quality of included studies</HEADING>
<P>We assessed the validity of each study using the criteria outlined in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2005</LINK>). Methods used for generation of the randomisation sequence were described for each trial.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(1) Selection bias (randomisation and allocation concealment)</HEADING>
<P>We assigned a quality score for each trial, using the following criteria:<BR/>(A) adequate concealment of allocation: such as telephone randomisation, consecutively-numbered, sealed opaque envelopes;<BR/>(B) unclear whether adequate concealment of allocation: such as list or table used, sealed envelopes, or study does not report any concealment approach;<BR/>(C) inadequate concealment of allocation: such as open list of random-number tables, use of case record numbers, dates of birth or days of the week.</P>
<P>We decided to exclude trials with inadequate allocation concealment (C).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(2) Attrition bias (loss of participants, for example, withdrawals, dropouts, protocol deviations)</HEADING>
<P>We assessed completeness to follow up using the following criteria:<BR/>(A) less than 5% loss of participants;<BR/>(B) 5% to 9.9% loss of participants;<BR/>(C) 10% to 19.9% loss of participants;<BR/>(D) more than 20% loss of participants.</P>
<P>We decided to exclude outcomes with 10% or more missing data.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(3) Performance bias (blinding of participants, researchers and outcome assessment)</HEADING>
<P>We assessed blinding using the following criteria:</P>
<OL>
<LI>blinding of participants (yes/no/unclear);</LI>
<LI>blinding of caregiver (yes/no/unclear);</LI>
<LI>blinding of outcome assessment (yes/no/unclear).</LI>
</OL>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Measures of treatment effect</HEADING>
<P>We carried out statistical analysis using the Review Manager software (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2008</LINK>). We used fixed-effect meta-analysis for combining data in the absence of significant heterogeneity if trials were sufficiently similar. If heterogeneity was found, this was to be explored by sensitivity analysis followed by random-effects analysis if required.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Dichotomous data</HEADING>
<P>For dichotomous data, we presented results as summary risk ratio with 95% confidence intervals.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Continuous data</HEADING>
<P>For continuous data, we used the mean difference if outcomes were measured in the same way between trials. We used the standardised mean difference to combine trials that measure the same outcome, but used different methods. If there was evidence of skewness, this was to be reported.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Unit of analysis issues</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Cluster-randomised trials</HEADING>
<P>We decided to include cluster-randomised trials in the analyses along with individually randomised trials. However, we did not identify any cluster-randomised trials but if we do in the future, we will use the methods in <LINK REF="APP-01" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 1</LINK>.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Dealing with missing data</HEADING>
<P>We decided to analyse data on all participants with available data in the group to which they are allocated, regardless of whether or not they received the allocated intervention. If in the original reports participants are not analysed in the group to which they were randomised, and there was sufficient information in the trial report or the information could be obtained from the trial authors, we would attempt to restore them to the correct group.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Assessment of heterogeneity</HEADING>
<P>We decided to apply tests of heterogeneity between trials, if appropriate, using the I² statistic. If we had identified high levels of heterogeneity among the trials (exceeding 50%), we would have explored it by prespecified subgroup analysis and performed sensitivity analysis. A random-effects meta-analysis would be used as an overall summary if this was considered appropriate.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Subgroup analyses</HEADING>
<P>We decided to conduct planned subgroup analyses classifying whole trials by interaction tests as described by <LINK REF="REF-Deeks-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deeks 2001</LINK>.</P>
<P>The plan was to carry out the following subgroup analyses:</P>
<OL>
<LI>women delivered vaginally or by caesarean section;</LI>
<LI>comparisons with or without the use of routine oxytocics;</LI>
<LI>uterine massage commenced before or after placental delivery.</LI>
</OL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Sensitivity analyses</HEADING>
<P>Sensitivity analyses are planned to explore the effect of trial quality assessed by concealment of allocation by excluding studies with inadequate allocation of concealment (rated B) and to assess the possible effect of publication bias by a sensitivity analysis excluding trials not identified from prospective trial registers.</P>

<P>Their sample sizes will be adjusted using the methods described in <LINK REF="REF-Gates-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gates 2005</LINK> using an estimate of the intra-cluster correlation co-efficient (ICC) derived from the trial (if possible), or from another source. If ICCs from other sources are used, this will be reported and sensitivity analyses conducted to investigate the effect of variation in the ICC. If we identify both cluster-randomised trials and individually-randomised trials, we plan to synthesise the relevant information. We will consider it reasonable to combine the results from both if there is little heterogeneity between the study designs and the interaction between the effect of intervention and the choice of randomisation unit is considered to be unlikely.</P>
