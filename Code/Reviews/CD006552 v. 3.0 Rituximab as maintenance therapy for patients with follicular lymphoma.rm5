<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2009-01-06 09:30:41 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Follicular lymphoma is a B-cell lymphoma characterised by an initial response to treatment that is usually followed by relapse and progression. Most patients present with advanced disease that cannot be cured. Lymphoma B-cells express CD20. Rituximab, a monoclonal anti-CD20 antibody, is expected to be active against cells that express CD20. Compared to chemotherapy alone, rituximab in combination with chemotherapy improves overall survival when used for induction therapy (treatment designed as a first step toward reducing the number of cancer cells) for patients with newly diagnosed or relapsed indolent lymphoma. Clinical trials that have shown improved event-free survival were inconsistent regarding overall (all-cause) survival. We aimed to evaluate the effects of maintenance therapy with rituximab on overall survival in patients with follicular lymphoma.<BR/>
<BR/>Study design: systematic review and meta-analysis of five randomised controlled trials (1056 patients).<BR/>Contribution: patients with follicular lymphoma and high tumour burden treated with rituximab maintenance therapy had better overall survival and disease control but more infections than patients who were observed without rituximab.<BR/>Implications: rituximab maintenance therapy should be added to the standard therapy of patients with relapsed or refractory (to treatment) follicular lymphoma following a successful induction treatment.<BR/>Limitations: variability in treatment regimens among trials precluded determination of the optimal rituximab maintenance regimen. One trial compared rituximab maintenance to rituximab at disease progression for patients with lower tumour burden and found both options to be comparable.<BR/>Future research should focus on:<BR/>the effect of rituximab maintenance compared to rituximab at progression;<BR/>defining which patients benefit the most from rituximab, according to burden of disease, prognostic score, the type of chemotherapy regimens used for induction, and the inclusion of rituximab in induction; and<BR/>the optimal duration of maintenance treatment, as well as its schedule.<BR/>Both randomised controlled trials and observational trials should have longer follow up in order to assess the long-term toxicity of rituximab, and should evaluate quality of life outcomes.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2009-01-07 01:26:44 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Follicular lymphoma (FL) is a subgroup of B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma that accounts for 15% to 30% of newly diagnosed lymphomas. Follicular lymphoma is an indolent lymphoma characterised by slow growth, high initial response rate but relapsing and progressive disease. Most patients present with advanced disease, that is stage III/IV, that cannot be cured with currently available therapies. The initiating genetic event found in 70% to 90% of patients with FL is the t(14;18), causing over-expression of the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein (<LINK REF="REF-Cleary-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cleary 1985</LINK>). Clinical trials have demonstrated an association between absence of the Bcl-2 rearrangement following therapy and reduced risk of reoccurrence (<LINK REF="REF-Corradini-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Corradini 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lopez_x002d_Guillermo-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lopez-Guillermo 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rambaldi-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rambaldi 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>New treatment modalities are therefore being sought. The chimeric monoclonal antibody rituximab, targeted against CD20, is expected to be active in many B-cell lymphomas as these cells express CD20. Rituximab, administered intravenously, in combination with chemotherapy was demonstrated to improve overall survival (OS) compared to chemotherapy alone for patients with newly diagnosed or relapsed indolent lymphoma (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 2005</LINK>). The value of rituximab as maintenance therapy for patients who responded to induction therapy is yet to be determined. Non-comparative series suggest that rituximab may improve response rates (<LINK REF="REF-Hainsworth-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hainsworth 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gordan-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gordan 2005</LINK>). Although clinical trials have demonstrated that rituximab maintenance treatment may prolong complete remission and progression-free survival, clear evidence of improvement in OS is lacking (Ghielmini 2004). In practice rituximab maintenance therapy is not recommended in the current guidelines (http://www.nccn.org/professionals/physician_gls/f_guidelines.asp).</P>
<P>To date, there are limited data from randomised clinical trials available to guide the use of rituximab as maintenance therapy in this patient population, and few long-term results. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of the literature to evaluate the long-term effects and OS with rituximab maintenance treatment in patients with follicular lymphoma.</P>

<P>Treatment in control group: in one trial (Hainsworth 2005) patients were treated with rituximab upon relapse whereas the other trials used observation. We repeated the analysis without that trial with no effect on the outcomes (<LINK REF="FIG-04" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 4</LINK>).</P>
<P>Maintenance schedule: there was no statistically significant effect of the rituximab schedule used on the outcomes (<LINK REF="FIG-05" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 5</LINK>).</P>
<P>Type of induction: inclusion of rituximab as part of the induction protocol did not significantly change the outcomes.

<P>There were not enough data to analyse OS according to: age, FLIPI score at baseline, performance status of patients, and grade of lymphoma. Almost all patients had stage III/IV, relapsed or refractory disease.</P>
<P>Previous treatment: patients who had received induction therapy in the past and had a refractory or relapsed FL (received two or more inductions) had a clear survival benefit with maintenance rituximab therapy compared with observation (Forstpointner 2006; Ghielmini 2004; Hainsworth 2005; van Oers 2006); patients who had not been treated in the past (maintenance treatment after first induction therapy) (Ghielmini 2004, Hochster 2005, <LINK REF="STD-Hochster-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Hochster 2007</LINK>) did not receive such benefit (HR 0.68, 95% CI 0.37 to 1.25) (<LINK REF="FIG-07" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 7</LINK>).</P>

Specifically, patients treated with rituximab maintenance had significantly more infection-related adverse effects compared to observation (RR 1.99, 95% CI 1.21 to 3.27) (<LINK REF="FIG-12" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 12</LINK>). When only severe infectious adverse events were included in the analysis this effect was even more pronounced (RR 2.90, 95% CI 1.24 to 6.76) (<LINK REF="FIG-13" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 13</LINK>). The infections were described in one trial (<LINK REF="STD-van-Oers-2006" TYPE="STUDY">van Oers 2006</LINK>) as mainly ear, nose and throat infections and hospitalisation was required for all the patients with grade III/IV adverse infectious events.<BR/>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2009-01-07 03:21:44 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Our review demonstrates that rituximab maintenance therapy improves overall survival (OS) and disease control compared to observation in patients with refractory or relapsed follicular lymphoma (FL) who respond to induction therapy. The effect on OS is significant despite a higher rate of severe adverse events, mainly infection-related adverse events.</P>
<P>Our review has several limitations as the five included studies differ in their induction therapy. In one trial no chemotherapy was given, and the chemotherapy regimen used varied among the other trials. Rituximab maintenance therapy retained survival benefit irrespective of the different induction regimen. The trial by Hochster (<LINK REF="STD-Hochster-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Hochster 2007</LINK>) had a subgroup of patients treated with cyclophosphamide and fludarabine who experienced a poorer outcome with maintenance therapy, though not statistically significant, which may suggest a possible interaction between the type of chemotherapy regimen and the effect of rituximab maintenance therapy. In addition, as these trials were conducted before rituximab was considered part of standard induction therapy for patients with FL, some of the patients did not receive rituximab in their induction regimen.</P>
<P>Further to its place in induction therapy, the optimal timing and schedule of rituximab treatment in FL is still unclear. Despite clear survival benefit when compared to observation, no benefit was demonstrated (<LINK REF="STD-Hainsworth-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Hainsworth 2005</LINK>) when rituximab maintenance was compared to rituximab at progression. The included trials represent two major approaches to the rituximab maintenance schedule; weekly infusions for four consecutive weeks every six months or a single infusion of rituximab every two to three months. Again, it should be noted that the different rituximab schedules did not significantly affect the results.</P>
<P>Despite those differences the results of the trials tended toward the same effect and no heterogeneity was shown, which supports the robustness of our results.</P>
<P>Three trials were terminated earlier than initially planned, after meeting the criteria set for stopping the trials. Statistical theories and the results of a systematic review of randomised trials stopped early for apparent benefit suggest that stopping trials early systematically overestimates treatment effects. The scientific validity of trials that are stopped early is further compromised when trials yield inconclusive data about outcomes that did not influence trial truncation, in this case OS.</P>

<P>The effect of rituximab maintenance therapy compared to rituximab at progression should be further explored. If rituximab maintenance therapy is found to give better outcomes, then the optimal protocol of maintenance treatment should be evaluated.<BR/>Future trials should focus on defining which patients benefit the most from rituximab, according to the type of chemotherapy regimens used for induction and the inclusion of rituximab in induction.<BR/>The optimal duration of maintenance treatment (that is, one year versus three years) as well as its schedule (that is, weekly for four weeks every six months versus a single infusion every two months) should be assessed in randomised controlled trials.</P>
<P>Both randomised controlled trials and observational trials should have longer follow up in order to assess the long-term toxicity of rituximab.</P>
