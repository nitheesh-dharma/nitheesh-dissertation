<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>The best way to keep a newborn baby's intravenous line working is still unknown.</P>
<P>We aimed to find out which was the better way to keep a newborn baby's intravenous line open and working -- either running a continuous amount of intravenous fluid through it (continuous infusion) or giving a small amount of fluid through it every few hours (intermittent flush) only. One study showed no difference between the two approaches for keeping a baby's intravenous line open and working and one study showed an advantage for intermittent flushes. The studies, however, had some problems in how the data were analysed and reported. Therefore, we are uncertain as to how reliable the results are and further research should be undertaken. <BR/>

</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>The use of peripheral intravenous cannulae is common in newborn babies. Many of them require an intravenous line only for medications and not for fluid. Currently there is little uniformity in methods used to maintain cannula patency. </P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>The object of this review was to determine which method was better for maintaining intravenous lines used in neonates for intravenous medication only: intermittent flushing or continuous infusion</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>We searched The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library, Issue 2, 2004), CINAHL (from 1982 to June 2004) and MEDLINE (from 1966 to June 2004) . </P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomised controlled trials comparing continuous infusion to intermittent flushing to maintain patency of intravenous cannulas. Units of randomisation might include individual catheters or individual babies.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Three reviewers independently assessed trial quality and extracted data.
<BR/>

</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Two studies were eligible for inclusion. In one study only one of our primary outcomes was available: the duration of cannula patency for the first cannula used per infant was slightly longer in the continuous infusion group, but not significantly so, with a mean difference of -4.3 hours (95% CI -18.2 to 9.7). </P>
<P>In the second study, only one of our primary outcomes was available: the mean (SD) number cannulas used per infant in the first 48 hours was less in the intermittent flush group with a mean difference of -0.76 cannulas (95% CI -1.37 to -0.15). No results were available for any of our other primary outcomes: in the published report, results were reported per catheter rather than per infant, a number of infants received more than one intravenous catheter (39 infants received an unknown number of catheters). The overall duration of cannula patency was significantly longer in the intermittent flush group with a mean duration of patency in the intermittent flush group of 2.1 days (SD 1.0) compared with the continuous infusion group where the mean duration of patency was 1.0 days (SD 0.5) - Student's t test P value 0.0003. <B>
<BR/>
</B>
</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>It is difficult to draw reliable conclusions given the way the data were analysed and reported in the two included studies. The reliability of the results is uncertain. However, given the caution in interpreting these data, it should also be noted that the use of intermittent flushes was not associated in either study with a decreased cannula life or any other disadvantages, thus lending some support for the use of intermittent flushing of cannulas in a selected population in neonatal nurseries. <BR/>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-10-16 11:13:08 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Peripheral intravenous cannula use is common in newborn babies admitted to neonatal nurseries (<LINK REF="REF-Ward-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ward 1993</LINK>). A significant number of these babies only require intermittent intravenous drug therapy and do not require supplemental fluids or other continuous drug infusions. Intravenous cannulation and therapy may require the baby to be separated from its mother, at least initially, and can delay the establishment of maternal infant bonding (<LINK REF="REF-Malcolm-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Malcolm 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>Insertion of peripheral intravenous cannulas in neonates can be a stressful experience for the baby, the new parent and the medical/nursing staff (<LINK REF="REF-Yeo-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yeo 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Olds-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Olds 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cotton-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cotton 1998</LINK>). It is therefore desirable once the intravenous cannula is inserted that its patency be maintained for as long as possible. Each cannula should last as long as possible and for any given period of treatment a minimum number of cannulas should be used. To achieve this the cannula can be infused continuously with fluid at a low rate or flushed intermittently (usually every 4-8 hours) (<LINK REF="REF-Cotton-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cotton 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>Continuous infusions require more nursing time and equipment and impede access of the mother to the infant but the cannula might last longer and have fewer complications such as extravasation or dislodgment. Intermittent flushing would decrease nursing time and equipment and allow greater access of the mother to her infant, but may decrease cannula life by blockage due to clotting. Currently there is little uniformity between neonatal nurseries as to which method is used and evidence is required to decide which method, if any, best maintains intravenous access.</P>
<P>There is limited evidence that the following factors may increase the risk of intravenous cannula failure: certain drugs (such as gentamicin or aminophylline) (<LINK REF="REF-Moclair-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moclair 1995</LINK>); size of cannula (<LINK REF="STD-Danek-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Danek 1992</LINK>).</P>
<P>A different question as to whether the continuous infusion fluid or the intermittent flush solution should contain heparin has been considered in a separate Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-Shah-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shah 2004</LINK>). Shah et al concluded that "no conclusive evidence is available...to evaluate the effectiveness of heparin to prolong PIV [peripheral intravenous] cannula life in the neonatal population". Only eight eligible studies were identified and only five commented on duration of catheter use. Due to significant clinical heterogeneity and heterogeneity in treatment effect no recommendation could be made as to whether use of heparin was advisable or not without further research.</P>
<P>As with all invasive procedures, there is a significant risk of introducing infection into the newborn when inserting a peripheral intravenous catheter. Septicaemia, although an infrequent complication could potentially have a lethal outcome. It is therefore desirable that catheter patency be maintained as long as possible thus reducing the number of skin breakages made in the baby and ultimately decreasing the risk of infection.</P>

<P>We also searched previous reviews including cross references. We also used the results of searches of abstracts, conference and symposia proceedings as done by the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group. No language restrictions were applied. Published or un-published data were considered.</P>
</SEARCH_METHODS>
<DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Criteria and methods used to assess the methodological quality of the trials: standard methods of the Cochrane Collaboration and its Neonatal Review Group were used. At least two of the reviewers worked independently to search for and assess trials for inclusion and methodological quality. Studies were assessed using the following key criteria: allocation concealment (blinding of randomisation), blinding of intervention, completeness of follow up and blinding of outcome measurement. The reviewers extracted data independently. Differences were resolved by discussion. An attempt was made to contact study investigators for additional information or data.</P>
<P>Data analysis:</P>
<P>For individual trials: for continuous variables such as duration of cannula patency, mean differences, and 95% confidence intervals were to be reported. For categorical outcomes such as mortality, the relative risks (RR) and 95% confidence intervals will be reported.</P>
<P>For pooled results: for continuous variables, weighted mean differences (WMD) and 95% confidence intervals will be reported. For categorical outcomes, the relative risks (RR) and 95% confidence intervals will be reported. For significant findings, the risk difference (RD) and number needed to treat (NNT) will also to be reported. Each treatment effect will be tested for heterogeneity to help determine suitability for pooling of results in a meta-analysis. The fixed effects model will be used for meta-analysis.</P>

<P>Two studies were identified for inclusion in this review (<LINK REF="STD-Kalyn-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Kalyn 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Taylor-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Taylor 1989</LINK>). Methods and clinical details including participants, interventions and outcomes are given in Table 1.</P>
<P>
<B>Included studies</B>
<BR/>Kalyn et al (<LINK REF="STD-Kalyn-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Kalyn 2000</LINK>) performed a multi-centre randomised controlled trial. Infants were randomised either to a continuous infusion of 0.5-1 mL/hr of 10% Dextrose or intermittent flushes with 0.5-1 mL every 6 hrs of 0.9% non heparinised saline. The infants were randomly assigned to their groups using a computer generated random number. Blinding of the interventions was obviously not done. Infants receiving intermittent drug therapies via a peripheral intravenous catheter were eligible for inclusion in the study but infants receiving continuous drug infusions or supplemental fluids were not. A total of 95 neonates (42 to intermittent flush group and 53 to continuous infusion group) were cannulated with 238 catheters (84 to intermittent flush group and 154 to the continuous infusion group) during the study period. The primary diagnosis for all the infants was sepsis. Follow-up continued until the intravenous catheter was either removed because intravenous medication was stopped or the catheter was no longer working; the infant was transferred elsewhere; or the infant required maintenance intravenous fluids. The two groups were all well matched for demographic and clinical variables, including birth weight, gestational age, the site and size of the catheters and types of drugs being administered. The duration of patency of each catheter was recorded as well as the reasons for loss of patency: phlebitis, occlusion, leaking and infiltration. The outcomes were reported per catheter used.</P>
<P>Taylor et al (<LINK REF="STD-Taylor-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Taylor 1989</LINK>) did a randomised controlled trial in infants who were admitted to the 'intermediate care' nursery who either:<BR/>1. required intravenous medications but no additional intravenous fluids, or<BR/>2. had an umbilical arterial catheter in situ and required an intravenous cannula for medications.<BR/>The infants were randomised either to a continuous infusion group where the intravenous line was kept patent by a continuous infusion of 10% dextrose (without heparin) at a rate of 1.5 to 3.0 ml/hr; or intermittent flushes where the intravenous cannula was kept patent with a heparin lock (0.5 ml of heparinised saline) given every six hours or after injection of medications. The method of randomisation was not stated. Blinding of the interventions was obviously not done. One infant in the intermittent flush group was excluded post randomisation because the "... catheter was needed only briefly, not allowing for time for data collection". Data were collected on a total of 39 neonates (22 to intermittent flush group and 17 to continuous infusion group) who were cannulated with an unknown number of catheters. The infants were enrolled in the study until they no longer required intravenous access. The two groups were all well matched for demographic and clinical variables, including birth weight and gestational age. Outcome measures included the number of days the infant was enrolled in the study; quantitation of parental medications, blood products and intravenous fluids; number of line infiltrations; duration of cannula patency (this seemed to have been measured for each cannula regardless of the number used in each infant); and the number of times the infant was removed from the incubator to be held by a nurse or parent.

<BR/>Excluded Studies</B>
<BR/>A number of studies were found which examined the duration of peripheral intravenous catheter patency with or without heparin intermittent flushes (<LINK REF="STD-Danek-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Danek 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hanrahan-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Hanrahan 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-LeDuc-1997" TYPE="STUDY">LeDuc 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McMullen-1993" TYPE="STUDY">McMullen 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nelson-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Nelson 1998</LINK>). However, none compared intermittent flushes with continuous infusions and were therefore not included in the review.

</UL>
<P>In the published report (<LINK REF="STD-Kalyn-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Kalyn 2000</LINK>) results were reported per catheter rather than per infant, a number of infants received more than one intravenous catheter (95 infants received 238 catheters in total). No statistically significant difference was found between the two groups for duration of cannula patency. The mean duration of patency in the intermittent flush group was 45.2 hours (SD 29.3) and in the continuous infusion group 48.7 hours (SD 41.1) - Mann-Whitney U test P value 0.13. However, whilst the mean duration of cannula patency in each group was similar, there were 84 cannulas used in the intermittent flush group and 154 cannulas used in the continuous infusion group. It is difficult to reconcile that mean duration of cannula use was not different; yet almost twice as many cannulas were used in the continuous infusion group. The average total duration of cannula use for infants in the continuous infusion group must have been longer (although data for this are not available). And therefore any differences between the two groups is prone to significant bias.<B>

<P>A significant difference (Chi squared test P &lt; 0.001) was found when the two catheter groups were compared with respect to the removal or loss of patency of catheters. The results were presented by catheter rather than by infant although it was stated that results were also analysed by infant and similar results were obtained. The catheters in the intermittent flush group were less likely to infiltrate, leak or cause phlebitis (35.7%) than in the continuous infusion group. The continuous infusion group, however, were less likely to occlude (9.1%) than the intermittent flush group (25%). In the intermittent flush group 39% of catheters (compared with 24% in the continuous infusion group) did not have infiltration/phlebitis/leaking/occlusion because the catheter was either removed because intravenous medication was stopped, the infant was transferred elsewhere or the infant required maintenance intravenous fluids.<BR/>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2008-10-16 11:13:08 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Even though one study showed no difference between the approaches for maintaining cannula patency and one showed an advantage for intermittent flushes, it is unfortunate that the way the data were analysed and reported in the two included studies makes the reliability of the results uncertain.</P>
<P>The reports (for both included studies) only included as their main outcome the average duration of cannula patency for all cannulas. That is, they reported duration of cannula patency for all cannulas in all infants in each treatment group averaged over the treatment course. Some infants would have had multiple cannulas and, therefore, the mean duration of cannula patency would include multiple measures of the duration of cannula patency in some infants with non-independence of those multiple measures. This would invalidate the assumptions necessary to ensure the reliability of the statistical tests used.</P>
<P>In the study by Kalyn et al (<LINK REF="STD-Kalyn-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Kalyn 2000</LINK>) the number of catheters per number of neonates was difficult to interpret and additional unpublished data are not available to clarify this. The reasons for re-cannulation of individual infants were not recorded in the study. However, the additional information that was provided by the study investigators for duration of patency for the first catheter used per infant did not show any significant difference between groups for this outcome.<B> </B>
</P>
<P>Taylor et al found a longer duration of cannula patency (averaged over all catheters for that infant) with intermittent flushing and greater ease of handling of those infants. They also found that the mean number of cannulas used per infant in the first 48 hours was less for intermittent flushing. We had speculated that a baby requiring intermittent flushing of their intravenous line is far more portable than one with a continuous infusion line. We believed that this would make handling, feeding and caring for baby easier for mothers in neonatal nurseries and enable staff the opportunity to enhance maternal-infant bonding opportunities. These outcomes were assessed by Taylor et al (<LINK REF="STD-Taylor-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Taylor 1989</LINK>) using a subjective nursing score (unblinded assessment) and they did find that the infants having intermittent flushes were easier to care for.</P>
<P>It should be noted that Taylor et al's study compared intermittent flushing of the cannula with heparinised saline with a continuous infusion that did not contain heparin. The use of heparinised saline for the intermittent flush used to maintain cannula patency has been reviewed by Shah et al (<LINK REF="REF-Shah-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shah 2004</LINK>). Their systematic review found five studies that compared intermittent flush with heparin and intermittent flush without heparin and reported the outcome of duration of cannula patency for the first cannula used per infant. There was no consistency of results for this outcome with two studies showing longer duration with heparin, one study showing longer duration without heparin and two studies showing no difference.<BR/>

</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>It is difficult to draw reliable conclusions given the way the data were analysed and reported in the two included studies. The reliability of the results is uncertain. However, given the caution in interpreting these data, it should also be noted that the use of intermittent flushes was not associated in either study with a decreased cannula life or any other disadvantages, thus lending some support for the use of intermittent flushing of cannulas in a selected population in neonatal nurseries. <B>
<BR/>
</B>
</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Further research is required to examine the duration of cannula patency comparing the two methods. Outcome assessment and data analysis should be reported by infant and by cannula (especially the first cannula used in each infant). Cost analysis would also be valuable comparing the cost of continuous infusions to intermittent flushing. Other outcomes that might enhance the interaction between mothers, babies and nursing staff would also be worthwhile, such as maternal satisfaction and ease of handling for mothers and nurses.<B>

There were 3 infants who had over 10 IV's starts in the continuous infusion group.  I can only speculate about why this may have occurred. Despite randomization, these infants may have been sicker. Or perhaps if a saline lock came out, infants were viewed as more &amp;quot;stable&amp;quot; and antibiotics may have been discontinued as opposed to infants with an IV, where an IV was restarted without the same consideration of stability.   Unfortunately, there is no way to truly confirm the reason for this imbalance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hope this information answers all of your questions but please let me know if there is anything else that I can do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sincerely,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Angela,Kalyn ACNP&lt;br&gt;Hamilton Health Sciences &lt;br&gt;McMaster Childrens Hospital&lt;br&gt;Kalyn@hhsc.ca.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" PRIMARY="NO" TYPE="JOURNAL_ARTICLE">

I put your message&lt;br&gt;aside, knowing it would take some time to find the data, and I have just&lt;br&gt;gotten back to this list of emails!  However, I was able to find the&lt;br&gt;original data forms and can provide some answers to your questions:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1.The allocation to treatment groups was blinded by sealed&lt;br&gt;envelops.&lt;br&gt;2.I do not have records regarding how many families were&lt;br&gt;approached who did not agree to participate in the trial.  However,&lt;br&gt;there was one heplock infant who was enrolled but data were not included&lt;br&gt;because the catheter was needed only briefly, not allowing for time for&lt;br&gt;data collection.  All 17 infants randomized to the TKO IV group were&lt;br&gt;included.&lt;br&gt;3.Clinical outcomes were not determined by blinded assessors,&lt;br&gt;since nurses in the unit obviously knew which infant had which mode of&lt;br&gt;IV.  The heparin assays were determined without knowledge of the&lt;br&gt;treatment group assignment.&lt;br&gt;4.Regarding the number of cannulas used in the first 48 hrs: &lt;br&gt;               For heplock group: 1.59 +/- 0.59, mean +/- SD (range 1 -&lt;br&gt;3)  N=22&lt;br&gt;                     For TKO IV group: 2.35  +/- 1.17    (1 - 5)  N= 17&lt;br&gt;                  (Note: these data include the first cannula placed at&lt;br&gt;study entrance)&lt;br&gt;5.Duration: I did not consistently keep track of the hour that the&lt;br&gt;catheters were placed; this was done by 8 or 12 hr shift, so I can't&lt;br&gt;calculate &lt;br&gt;the numbers that you request.&lt;br&gt;6.Loss of cannula function;  data for first 48 hrs:  &lt;br&gt;                     TKO IV group:  10 infiltrated, 2 dislodged, 5&lt;br&gt;intact &lt;br&gt;                      Heplock group: 11 infiltrated, 1 dislodged, 10&lt;br&gt;intact&lt;br&gt;                 During the entire study period: &lt;br&gt;                      TKO IV group: 2/17 did not need to be replaced&lt;br&gt;                      Heplock IV: 8/22 never needed to be replaced&lt;br&gt;7.No phlebitis, other localized infections or associated&lt;br&gt;nosocomial sepsis noted &lt;br&gt;8.We included data regarding holding in the paper.

<CHAR_METHODS>
<P>Multi-centre randomised controlled trial with treatment group allocation determined by computer generated randomisation.</P>
<P>Assessment of the following key criteria:<BR/>allocation concealment (blinding of randomisation) - yes, group allocation was concealed by opaque envelopes;<BR/>blinding of intervention - no;<BR/>completeness of follow up - all infants that entered the study were accounted for;<BR/>blinding of outcome measurement - no.<BR/>

<P>Number of catheters = 238<BR/>-154 in CI<BR/>-84 in IF<BR/>
</P>
</CHAR_PARTICIPANTS>
<CHAR_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>Continuous infusion (CI) using 0.5-1 mL of 10% Dextrose; or <BR/>intermittent flushing (IF) using 0.5-1 mL 0.9% normal saline flushed before and after every medication and every 6 hours.<BR/>

<P>Proportion of catheters with:<BR/>1. infiltration, phlebitis or leaking;<BR/>2. occlusion;<BR/>3. either removal because intravenous medication was stopped, the infant was transferred elsewhere or the infant required maintenance intravenous fluids.</P>
</CHAR_OUTCOMES>
<CHAR_NOTES>
<P>The infants were randomised and allocated to either group, but the data were analysed and reported by catheter.</P>

<CHAR_METHODS>
<P>Randomised controlled trial. The randomisation method was not stated.</P>
<P>Assessment of the following key criteria:<BR/>allocation concealment (blinding of randomisation) - yes, group allocation was concealed by opaque envelopes;<BR/>blinding of intervention - no;<BR/>completeness of follow up - all infants that entered the study were accounted for;<BR/>blinding of outcome measurement - no.</P>
</CHAR_METHODS>
<CHAR_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>Newborn infants who were admitted to the 'intermediate care' nursery who either 1. required intravenous medications but no additional intravenous fluids, or 2. had an umbilical arterial catheter in situ and required an intravenous cannula for medications.</P>
<P>Number of infants = 39<BR/>-IF=22<BR/>-CI=17</P>
</CHAR_PARTICIPANTS>
<CHAR_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>Continuous infusion (CI) using 10% dextrose (without heparin) at a rate of 1.5 to 3.0 ml/hr; or <BR/>intermittent flushing (IF) using a heparin lock (0.5 ml of heparinised saline) given every 6 hours or after injection of medications.</P>
</CHAR_INTERVENTIONS>
<CHAR_OUTCOMES>
<P>Outcome measures included:<BR/>the number of days the infant was enrolled in the study; <BR/>quantitation of parental medications, blood products and intravenous fluids; <BR/>number of line infiltrations; <BR/>duration of cannula patency (this seemed to have been measured for each cannula regardless of the number used in each infant); and <BR/>the number of times the infant was removed from the incubator to be held by a nurse or parent.</P>
