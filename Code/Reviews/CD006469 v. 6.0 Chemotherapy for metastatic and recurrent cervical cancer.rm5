<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2012-08-05 21:55:17 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Cervical cancer often affects young women. Cancer that has come back after initial treatment (recurrent) or has already spread around the body at diagnosis (metastatic) is incurable so chemotherapy is aimed at improving length of life, while maintaining good quality of life. A literature search was conducted identifying 30 potential trials; four trials were excluded. The 26 clinical trials included in this review encompass a large range of different drugs, doses and combinations in a mixed group of patients over a long time period (1976 to 2011), making it difficult to compare treatment options. Although there are no trials directly comparing chemotherapy with symptomatic management alone, chemotherapy is widely used in this setting and assumed to be of benefit. Cisplatin and carboplatin chemotherapy were shown to shrink the cancer in 10% to 30% of patients and are widely used in current practice. Cisplatin chemotherapy when combined with other drugs has been shown to prolong survival by a few months compared with cisplatin alone, but with the cost of increased side effects. Other chemotherapy has been used, but has been found to be less effective or more toxic. Quality of life for patients on chemotherapy appears to be similar for cisplatin and cisplatin-based combinations. Nearly all patients in these studies were relatively fit and well prior to starting treatment, despite their cancer; these results may not be the same in patients who are not fit and well.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2012-08-04 21:24:54 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Cervical cancer is the second most common cancer among women up to 65 years of age and is the most frequent cause of death from gynaecological cancers worldwide. A woman's risk of developing cervical cancer by 65 years of age ranges from 0.69% in developed countries to 1.38% in developing countries. Although screening by Pap smear should mean early detection at a curable stage for most women, many still present with advanced or metastatic disease with a worse prognosis. The addition of platinum-based chemotherapy to radiotherapy has improved outcome compared to radiotherapy alone; however, 30% to 50% fail to respond to treatment or develop recurrent disease. There are no standard treatment options for these patients, although platinum-based chemotherapy is frequently used and trials are on-going.</P>

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2012-08-06 11:48:22 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jennifer L Forrest">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Gynaecological Cancer Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, Issue 1, 2012), MEDLINE (1950 to January 2012) and EMBASE (1980 to January 2012).

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-08-09 12:26:14 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There were no data comparing best supportive care with chemotherapy. Cisplatin-based regimens are the most widely used and therefore we have concentrated on these trials. In terms of response rates some non-platinum regimens are equivalent but toxicity is higher. The most common cisplatin regimen was 50 mg/m<SUP>2</SUP> day 1 q21days. Higher doses had similar survivals. There was no direct comparison between single-agent cisplatin and carboplatin. Overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were not adequately reported and quality of life (QoL) outcomes were incompletely documented. Combination regimens were more toxic than single agents, but in the limited reported data this did not appear to adversely affect QoL.</P>
<P>No significant difference in response rate by site of recurrence was found, although there was a trend towards improved response when the main site of disease was beyond the previously irradiated pelvis.</P>

<P>Combination cisplatin-based chemotherapy could be a viable option for patients of good performance status with recurrent/metastatic cervical cancer, but further trials that report adequate survival and QoL data are sought. Response rates and improvements in survival are low. Cisplatin-based combinations have significant toxicity. Outcomes are poor and novel cytotoxic/biological agents and optimal scheduling need further investigation. Future trials need to stratify for and perform planned subgroup analysis with respect to previous treatment and site of recurrence.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2012-08-05 22:25:58 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Cervical carcinoma arises in the uterine cervix and 60% to 70% of cases are squamous cell carcinomas, approximately 25% to 30% are adenocarcinomas or adenosquamous carcinomas, with a very small number of rarer cancers, such as small cell tumours and neuroendocrine tumours (<LINK REF="REF-Jemal-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jemal 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Meta_x002d_analysis-Collaboration-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meta-analysis Collaboration 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>Cervical cancer is the second most common cancer among women aged up to 65 years and is the most frequent cause of death from gynaecological cancers worldwide. A woman's risk of developing cervical cancer by 65 years of age ranges from 0.69% in developed countries to 1.38% in developing countries (<LINK REF="REF-GLOBOCAN-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">GLOBOCAN 2008</LINK>). In Europe, about 60% of women with cervical cancer are alive five years after diagnosis (<LINK REF="REF-EUROCARE_x002d_3" TYPE="REFERENCE">EUROCARE-3</LINK>). The stage of disease at diagnosis determines survival rates; lesions less than 4 cm in diameter and confined to the cervix (FIGO (International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics) Stage Ib1) at presentation have a five-year survival rate of 92%, while women with cancer spread beyond the true pelvis to adjacent organs (FIGO Stage IVa) have a five-year survival rate of only 17% (<LINK REF="REF-Jemal-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jemal 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Meta_x002d_analysis-Collaboration-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meta-analysis Collaboration 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>The overwhelming risk factor for development of cervical cancer is the presence of human papilloma virus (HPV), particularly subtypes 16 and 18. Vaccines against HPV have become available and introduced in some countries. In the future it is hoped this will significantly reduce the incidence of cervical cancer. HPV causes the cervical epithelium to become increasingly abnormal (graded as cervical intra-epithelial neoplasia (CIN) grades I to III), this then becomes invasive in 30% to 70% of women over 10 to 12 years, although this process can be much faster in a small minority (&lt; one year). Invasive cancer then spreads directly by invading adjacent structures and metastasising via regional lymph nodes and, less commonly, via the bloodstream to distant sites such as the lungs.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2012-08-05 22:26:13 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Early-stage cancer confined to the cervix, or with extension into upper vagina (Stage I to IIa), can be successfully treated by radical surgery (with or without neoadjuvant chemotherapy) or concomitant chemoradiation, giving five-year survival rates of 80% to 90% (<LINK REF="REF-Eifel-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eifel 2001</LINK>). A European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) trial (EORTC 55994) of chemoradiotherapy versus neoadjuvant chemotherapy plus surgery is on-going. For more advanced cancer, Stages IIb to IVa the treatment of choice is chemoradiotherapy; as a Cochrane meta-analysis has shown that the addition of platinum-based chemotherapy significantly improves survival compared to radiotherapy alone (<LINK REF="REF-Green-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Green 2005</LINK>). Combined chemoradiotherapy will cure 50% to 70% of patients with locally advanced carcinoma of the cervix (<LINK REF="REF-Meta_x002d_analysis-Collaboration-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meta-analysis Collaboration 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Willmott-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Willmott 2009</LINK>) and can be used for local control of metastatic disease.</P>
<P>Palliative chemotherapy is used for the management of Stage IVb patients whose disease has spread to distant sites, or for patients with inoperable recurrent or persistent disease (<LINK REF="REF-de-la-Motte-Rouge-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">de la Motte Rouge 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pectasides-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pectasides 2008</LINK>). A number of chemotherapeutic options have been used either as single agents or in combination including cisplatin, adriamycin, ifosfamide, paclitaxel, irinotecan, topotecan, vinorelbine and gemcitabine with responses in the range of 15% to 46% (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tewari-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tewari 2005</LINK>).</P>

<THEORY MODIFIED="2012-08-04 21:38:39 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The aim of chemotherapy is to slow cancer growth, improve survival with minimal toxicity so there is an improvement in quality of life (QoL).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2012-08-04 21:38:47 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There are no standard treatments for patients with persistent, recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer. In this group of patients, who are often young and otherwise fit and well, it is important to establish chemotherapy regimens that have the greatest chance of response with tolerable side effects and an improvement in QoL. In the era of chemoradiation as primary management for locally advanced cervical cancer the role of chemotherapy in this setting becomes even more important to establish.</P>

<P>For the purposes of this review chemotherapy refers to any cytotoxic drug given intravenously or orally with the intent of producing tumour regression as defined by World Health Organization (WHO) criteria for assessing response (<LINK REF="REF-Miller-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Miller 1981</LINK>); thus biological and immunomodulators were excluded. Trials involving concomitant radiotherapy were excluded because this could complicate assessment of response to chemotherapy, which is the primary objective of the review, particularly as most trials involving radiotherapy compare radiotherapy with radiotherapy plus chemotherapy. Intra-arterial chemotherapy regimens were excluded as this was felt to be a local rather than systemic therapy and so not comparable. We included trials that used both platinum and non-platinum chemotherapy and planned to subgroup based on whether the chemotherapy was platinum or non-platinum based (see <LINK TAG="SUBGROUP_ANALYSIS" TYPE="SECTION">Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity</LINK>). Best supportive care is not a clearly defined term, but is generally considered to include any interventions that palliate symptoms and optimise QoL, without treating the underlying cancer, such as pain relief or psychological support (<A HREF="http://www.WHO.int">www.WHO.int</A>). Where there is no standard treatment option for a particular disease new treatments are often compared with best supportive care (i.e. symptom control) alone.<BR/>

<P>The RCTs included in this review dated from the 1970s to the present day with the number of patients ranging from five to 581. The trials included patients with locally recurrent, persistent or metastatic disease. Most of the patients had previously received radiotherapy to the primary site; however, since 1999 chemoradiotherapy has been the gold standard treatment for locally advanced disease and so patients included in more recent trials were likely to have previously received concurrent chemotherapy (generally platinum-based) with radiotherapy.</P>
<P>The trials used a wide variety of designs and chemotherapy schedules. Five trials compared single-agent platinum with a platinum-containing combination (<LINK REF="STD-Alberts-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Alberts 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cadron-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Cadron 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Long-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Long 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moore-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Moore 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Omura-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Omura 1997</LINK>) generally cisplatin, four trials compared single-agent platinum with different formulations or doses (<LINK REF="STD-Bonomi-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Bonomi 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lira_x002d_Puerto-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Lira-Puerto 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McGuire-1989" TYPE="STUDY">McGuire 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Thigpen-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Thigpen 1989</LINK>), two trials compared single-agent platinum with a non-platinum (<LINK REF="STD-Long-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Long 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pfeiffer-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Pfeiffer 1998</LINK>), 10 trials compared a variety of non-platinum-containing regimens (<LINK REF="STD-Bond-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Bond 1976</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Freedman-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Freedman 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Greenberg-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Greenberg 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Malkasian-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Malkasian 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moseley-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Moseley 1976</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Omura-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Omura 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Omura-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Omura 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Palo-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Palo 1976</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wallace-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Wallace 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Weiss-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Weiss 1992</LINK>), four trials compared differing platinum combinations (<LINK REF="STD-Bloss-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Bloss 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Edmonson-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Edmonson 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Monk-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Monk 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mountzios-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Mountzios 2009</LINK>) and the remaining trial compared non-platinum single-agent with platinum-containing combination (<LINK REF="STD-Bezwoda-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Bezwoda 1986</LINK>).</P>
<P>Outcomes were incompletely reported, with only response rate and some adverse event components being reported to an adequate level to include in meta-analyses. Time to event data were poorly reported with most trials presenting median and quartile statistics. Median survival in all trials ranged from four months to 17 months. The intention was to compare survival data and time to progression data by comparing HRs, but these were only reported in two studies. Where data were not reported, we had hoped to be able to calculate them using the method described by <LINK REF="REF-Parmar-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parmar 1998</LINK>, by extracting the log rank P value, number of events and the number of subjects in the treatment and control groups; however, insufficient trial data (mean survival, probabilities or individual patient data) had been reported for this. <LINK REF="REF-Michiels-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Michiels 2005</LINK> showed that median survival times are not reasonable surrogate measures for meta-analysis of survival. Eighteen of the 26 trials did not perform intention-to-treat analyses.</P>
<P>It had been anticipated that the majority of trials would be reporting toxicity with reference to Common Toxicity Criteria version 3.0 (CTCv3.0); however, this only became available in 2003 (replacing version 2.0, which ran from 1998 to 2003) and the majority of included trials (18/26) were published prior to 2003.

<HEADING LEVEL="3">In-field versus out-of-field responses with platinum-containing chemotherapy</HEADING>
<P>Some authors hypothesised that response rates to chemotherapy will be less in previously irradiated areas therefore some trials performed a subgroup analysis to compare in-radiotherapy-field versus out-of-field response rates. In order to attempt to explore this it was decided to only look at platinum-containing regimens, which were selected because they are the most widely used clinically and have demonstrable activity. Meta-analysis of six RCTs (<LINK REF="STD-Bloss-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Bloss 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cadron-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Cadron 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Edmonson-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Edmonson 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lira_x002d_Puerto-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Lira-Puerto 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McGuire-1989" TYPE="STUDY">McGuire 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moore-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Moore 2004</LINK>), assessing 1062 participants, found that the proportion of women who responded to treatment was significantly lower for recurrences within the pelvic field compared with disease outside of the pelvic radiotherapy field (RR 0.62; 95% CI 0.46 to 0.83). The percentage of the variability in effect estimates that was because of heterogeneity between studies rather than chance may represent moderate heterogeneity (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 34%). Two trials were excluded from the meta-analysis because of incomplete data (<LINK REF="STD-Bezwoda-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Bezwoda 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pfeiffer-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Pfeiffer 1998</LINK>). Of note the majority of patients had not received prior chemotherapy (77.2%) with their radiotherapy. Where patients had had previous chemotherapy this was generally cisplatin as part of chemoradiotherapy, rather than chemotherapy alone with palliative intent (see <LINK REF="CMP-001.07" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.7</LINK> and <LINK REF="TBL-05" TYPE="TABLE">Table 5</LINK>).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Overall survival, progression-free survival and time to progression</HEADING>
<P>OS and PFS was incompletely reported and there was insufficient information across trials to allow pooling of results.</P>
<P>OS with cisplatin alone was 6.5 to 9 months (&gt; 11 trials) with PFS of approximately three months (additional tables). With cisplatin combination OS was 7 to 10 months with PFS of 4.6 to 4.9 months. The <LINK REF="STD-Alberts-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Alberts 1987</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Cadron-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Cadron 2005</LINK> trials were excluded as the numbers were small and appeared to be outliers to other studies with greater numbers.</P>
<P>When comparing cisplatin-containing regimens with non-platinum-containing regimens there was marked heterogeneity owing to different activities. Again ranges of OS were 4 to 9.6 months and PFS 2.9 to 4.6 months.</P>
<P>The addition of a taxane led to OS of 12.9 to 15.4 months with PFS of 5.8 to 7.9 months. However, these were based on more recent trials (<LINK REF="STD-Monk-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Monk 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mountzios-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Mountzios 2009</LINK>) rather than older trials.</P>
<P>Some trials compared different cisplatin or carboplatin doses. The most commonly used was cisplatin 50 mg/m<SUP>2</SUP> day one every 21 days with median OS of eight months and median response rates of 19%. This is a relatively low dose compared with cisplatin doses in other tumour sites. Higher doses of cisplatin were explored by <LINK REF="STD-Bonomi-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Bonomi 1985</LINK> yielding a higher response rate of 31% but no difference in OS (seven months). However, this was one study with limited power to detect differences owing to low patients numbers and high drop-out rates and so the question remains unanswered. Carboplatin gave similar median response rates of 26% with median OS of 7.5 months.</P>
<P>HRs were only reported in two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Monk-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Monk 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Long-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Long 2005</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Long-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Long 2005</LINK> found a survival advantage of cisplatin/topotecan over cisplatin alone in patients with recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer; with a PFS of 2.9 versus 4.6 months (HR 0.76) and OS of 6.5 versus 9.4 months (HR 0.76). <LINK REF="STD-Monk-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Monk 2008</LINK> compared three chemotherapy doublets (cisplatin/vinorelbine, cisplatin/gemcitabine and cisplatin/topotecan) with the standard of cisplatin/paclitaxel. They found that no one doublet was statistically significantly superior but there was a trend in PFS, OS and response rate favouring the control arm of cisplatin/paclitaxel (<LINK REF="TBL-06" TYPE="TABLE">Table 6</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Toxicity</HEADING>
<P>Among all the studies there were 23 deaths from non-cancer-related causes. Fifteen of these were reported as treatment-related with seven deaths from neutropenic sepsis (often with secondary acute renal failure), two from haemorrhage owing to severe thrombocytopenia, two from pulmonary toxicity owing to bleomycin, one from acute renal failure following cisplatin and one death owing to ifosfamide-induced encephalopathy. Four deaths owing to severe haematological toxicity were reported in patients receiving MVAC in the GOG179 trial (<LINK REF="STD-Long-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Long 2006</LINK>) causing this arm in the trial to be closed early after only sixty-three patients had been treated with the regimen. Eight other non-cancer deaths were reported although not linked directly to treatment by the authors, including two fatal pulmonary emboli (<LINK REF="STD-Long-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Long 2005</LINK>) and six deaths in one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Edmonson-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Edmonson 1988</LINK>) owing to cardiac arrests and cerebrovascular accidents in patients who had been receiving cisplatin/bleomycin (two deaths) or cisplatin/bleomycin/doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide (four deaths)).</P>
<P>Because of the heterogeneity in types and combinations of cytotoxic agents used, with many trials only containing small patient numbers and with a wide variety of toxicity scoring systems used it was difficult to analyse and compare the toxicity data. With these provisos an attempt was made to compare toxicities between trials were reported in sufficient detail.

<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Long-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Long 2005</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Moore-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Moore 2004</LINK> found that patients with metastatic or recurrent disease had reduced QoL scores compared to the general population prior to starting treatment (particularly with respect to loss of function and physical wellbeing). In the trial of cisplatin with or without topotecan (<LINK REF="STD-Long-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Long 2005</LINK>) there was an association between higher QoL scores at baseline and OS with those in the highest scoring quartile having a 47% lower hazard of death when compared with the lowest scoring quartile (HR 0.53; 95% CI 0.36 to 0.78; P = 0.001). Among patients who complete protocol therapy the serial measurements of QoL scores tend to remain stable no matter which treatment arm they had been allocated to. There was also no difference in QoL scores when comparing single-agent cisplatin with different cisplatin combinations at any time point.

<UL>
<LI>There are no data comparing best supportive care with chemotherapy.</LI>
<LI>Survival data were incompletely reported so there is an absence of evidence for important outcomes such as OS and PFS.</LI>
<LI>Numerous older trials had small patient numbers and significant potential for bias.</LI>
<LI>Large numbers of different chemotherapy agents and combinations have been explored making for heterogeneous data. It is thus difficult to interpret pooled results satisfactorily. Cisplatin-based regimens are the most widely used currently and historically and therefore this review has concentrated on these trials.</LI>
<LI>In terms of response rates some non-platinum regimens were equivalent but toxicity was significantly higher, for example the MVAC arm was closed early owing to four treatment-related deaths (of 63 patients) (<LINK REF="STD-Long-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Long 2006</LINK>).</LI>
<LI>The most widely used cisplatin regimen was 50 mg/m<SUP>2</SUP> day 1 q21days. Some trials hinted that higher doses had similar survivals, but this could not be confirmed or refuted owing to poor reporting of time to event data. There was no direct comparison between cisplatin and carboplatin but response rate with single-agent carboplatin was similar to single-agent cisplatin.</LI>
<LI>Evidence to suggest that cisplatin combination improves response rates when compared with single-agent cisplatin, but further trials are needed to ascertain whether this is the case for OS and PFS. However no one combination is significantly different from others (<LINK REF="STD-Monk-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Monk 2008</LINK>), although some outcomes may be improved with cisplatin/paclitaxel. Thus toxicity profile, scheduling and co-morbidity are important when individualising therapy.</LI>
<LI>Combination regimens are more toxic than single-agent regimens but in the limited reported data this does not appear to impact on QoL, although further trials reporting QoL outcomes are required.</LI>
<LI>Nine of the 23 included trials performed subgroup analyses comparing response rates between previously irradiated and non-irradiated sites. Eight of these found no significant difference in response rate by site of recurrence although there was a trend towards improved response when the main site of disease was beyond the previously irradiated pelvis.</LI>

</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2012-08-05 22:26:26 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review included patients enrolled into trials with local relapse, distant relapse and primary metastatic disease. The relapsed patients may have had primary treatment with surgery, radiotherapy or chemoradiotherapy. There are no data comparing responses in these different groups. Since 1999, cisplatin-based chemoradiotherapy has been the preferred treatment in patients presenting with Stage 1b2 or above. In this analysis less than 30% of patients had received prior chemoradiotherapy and thus the generalisability of these results remains uncertain. It is likely that response will be less especially in patients with short disease-free intervals or in previously irradiated sites. Conversely there are no data to suggest that there is a lack of response in all patients who have received prior chemoradiotherapy.</P>
<P>There is no direct evidence documenting a comparison of chemotherapy and best supportive care. Cisplatin-based combinations appear to have the highest response rates but median OS remains poor at nine to 12 months with PFS of four to five months.  Thus metastatic cervical cancer remains relatively chemo-insensitive.</P>
<P>There is a lack of data on QoL and also survival outcomes. Optimising QoL is essential in this group of palliative patients. Only three trials reported QoL data and new trials need to include this as an outcome. The limited data reported have indicated that cisplatin combination chemotherapy is not detrimental to patient experience, but in the absence of adequate QoL and survival data results need to be interpreted with caution.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2012-08-05 21:30:04 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The quality of the evidence is low as important outcomes such as OS were incompletely reported and the chemotherapeutic agents used in the different trials varied markedly making comparisons difficult and the presence of heterogeneity across trials a problem. More recent trials, which are most relevant to our results and reflect current practice, are of a more acceptable quality, but most still did not report outcomes satisfactorily.</P>
<P>For example, the most widely used cisplatin regimen was 50 mg/m<SUP>2</SUP> day 1 q21days. It is not possible to comment on optimal cisplatin owing to inadequate survival data. There were no direct comparisons between cisplatin and carboplatin. Although response rates with single-agent carboplatin were similar to single-agent cisplatin there is insufficient evidence to conclude their equivalence. Further trials on the optimal platinum compound and dose would be clinically useful.</P>
<P>Only in very recent studies, comparing cisplatin combinations, are survival and QoL outcomes reported adequately. Toxicity was reported using different scales and the data were very heterogeneous</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2012-08-05 21:25:59 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>An extensive literature search was performed in EMBASE, MEDLINE, LILACS, CENTRAL, Physician Data Query and Meta-Register. No un-published data were identified. In order to minimise bias a thorough search of grey literature was performed. Strict inclusion and exclusion criteria were also used to make sure that all appropriate trials were included. We restricted the included studies to RCTs as they provided the strongest level of evidence available. Hence we have attempted to reduce bias in the review process.</P>
<P>The greatest threat to the validity of the review is likely to be the possibility of publication bias, that is studies that did not find the treatment to have been effective may not have been published. We were unable to assess this possibility as the number of trials in each comparison was limited.</P>

<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2012-08-05 21:31:19 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Other reviews and meta-analyses of chemotherapy in metastatic or recurrent cervical cancer have been undertaken, all of which concur with the importance of basing treatment on a platinum compound and highlighting the improved PFS when cisplatin used in combination rather than as a single agent (<LINK REF="REF-Tewari-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tewari 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Pectasides-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pectasides 2008</LINK> reviewed chemotherapy for recurrent cervical cancer, including Phase II non-randomised data that has not been included in this review. His conclusions of single-agent and combination therapy were similar to those of this review. That is, cisplatin appears to have the highest response rates and analogues of cisplatin, such as carboplatin or iproplatin, were active. Doxorubicin, paclitaxel and topotecan showed significant activity as single agents with 15% to 20% response rates. For combination chemotherapy cisplatin has been combined with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) <LINK REF="REF-Weiss-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weiss 1990</LINK>, bleomycin, ifosfamide, gemcitabine, vinorelbine, paclitaxel and topotecan in Phase II and III trials. Many of these trials showed an advantage in terms of response rate for combination when compared with single-agent cisplatin and in some there was also a PFS advantage (cisplatin plus ifosfamide (<LINK REF="STD-Omura-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Omura 1997</LINK>), cisplatin plus paclitaxel (<LINK REF="STD-Moore-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Moore 2004</LINK>) and cisplatin plus topotecan (<LINK REF="STD-Long-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Long 2006</LINK>)). Only cisplatin plus topotecan showed a survival advantage over single-agent cisplatin.</P>
<P>Many centres are using carboplatin-based combinations in this group of patients despite there being no randomised evidence published to support this. Thus as part of this review of RCTs the Phase II data is not represented. Non-randomised Phase II data suggest that carboplatin in combination with paclitaxel is active and well tolerated (<LINK REF="REF-Pectasides-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pectasides 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tinker-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tinker 2005</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-Moore-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2007</LINK> published a retrospective study comparing cisplatin with carboplatin in combination with paclitaxel suggesting equivalent efficacy. One Phase III randomised trial (<LINK REF="STD-Saito-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Saito 2010</LINK>) is currently recruiting comparing carboplatin/paclitaxel with cisplatin/paclitaxel, which will provide further information on whether carboplatin can be substituted for cisplatin, improving toxicity profile without compromising outcome. This is a particularly important question because of the high frequency of renal impairment in patients with locally recurrent disease limiting their suitability for cisplatin-containing regimens.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Mutch-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mutch 2003</LINK> reviewed the role of gemcitabine in cervical cancer; the majority of the data being non-randomised Phase II trials that are not represented in this paper. They conclude that gemcitabine has demonstrated little activity as a single agent but that it appears to act synergistically with cisplatin. <LINK REF="STD-Monk-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Monk 2008</LINK> found similar results in terms of response rate, PFS and OS between cisplatin plus gemcitabine, cisplatin plus paclitaxel, cisplatin plus vinorelbine and cisplatin plus topotecan.</P>
<P>Cisplatin-based combinations are currently the most widely used internationally, making the results of this review applicable.</P>

<P>When treating patients with metastatic or recurrent cervical cancer combination cisplatin-based chemotherapy could be a viable treatment option, but further trials that report adequate survival and QoL data are sought. The role of carboplatin in this context is not established. There is a trend to improved outcome with cisplatin plus paclitaxel combinations but the different toxicity profiles of the various combinations should be discussed individually.</P>
<P>Response rates and improvements in survival were low, therefore chemotherapy may not be appropriate for all patients, especially those with poorer performance status. The majority of patients in these trials were performance status 0 to 1, only small numbers of performance status 2 to 3 patients were included. Cisplatin-based combination chemotherapy had significant toxicity.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2012-08-05 12:10:18 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is one ongoing randomised Phase III trial that should address the question of substitution of cisplatin by carboplatin in patients with metastatic and recurrent cervical cancer (<LINK REF="STD-Saito-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Saito 2010</LINK>). QoL, toxicity and survival will be critical end points for this trial and others.</P>
<P>In other tumour sites weekly regimens have shown better responses and toxicity profiles. This should be explored for cervical cancer.</P>
<P>Overall response rates and survival are poor and novel cytotoxic and biological agents need investigation. The evaluation of existing biological agents was outside the scope of this review; however, agents targeting angiogenesis, epidermal growth factor receptors, histone deacetylases, COX-2 and m-TOR are currently in clinical development. Far fewer molecularly targeted agents have been trialed in cervical cancer compared with other tumour sites, especially at the Phase III level and therefore none of these agents are currently approved for use in clinical practice.</P>
<P>Future trials need to stratify for and perform planned subgroup analysis with respect to previous treatment and site of recurrence.</P>
<P>Future trials should report HRs for survival data to facilitate meta-analysis of pooled data.</P>
