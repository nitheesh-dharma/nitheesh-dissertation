<P>Bell's palsy or idiopathic facial palsy is the most common disorder affecting the facial nerves and results in weakness or paralysis on one side of the face. The paralysis causes distortion of the face and interferes with normal functions, such as closing the eye and eating. It is thought to be caused by inflammation of the facial nerve.</P>
<P>According to Traditional Chinese Medicine, facial paralysis is known as 'deviated mouth'. It was attributed to 'wind' by past dynasties. 'Qi' refers to the vital substances comprising the human body and the physiological functions of viscera and bowels, channels and collaterals. It maintains life activities and reflects the resistance of the human body. Deficiency of 'qi' allows the invasion of exogenous pathogenic wind. Acupuncture is part of Traditional Chinese Medicine and dates back thousands of years. It involves inserting fine needles into specific points on the skin or applying various other techniques to the acupuncture points to bring about healing. In Bell's palsy, acupuncture treatment might have numerous beneficial effects. This review aimed to review systematically all randomised controlled trials and controlled clinical trials, which examined the effectiveness of acupuncture by needle insertion for Bell's palsy. Six studies including a total of 537 participants met the inclusion criteria. Five studies used acupuncture while the other used acupuncture combined with drugs. No trials reported on the outcomes specified for this review. Harmful side effects were not reported in any of the trials. Poor quality caused by flaws in study design or reporting (including uncertain method of randomisation, allocation concealment and blinding) and clinical differences between trials prevented reliable conclusions about the efficacy of acupuncture.

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2010-06-07 14:25:35 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Ruth Brassington">
<P>We updated the searches of the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group Trials Specialized Register (24 May 2010), The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (Issue 2, 2010), MEDLINE (January 1966 to May 2010), EMBASE (January 1980 to May 2010), AMED (January 1985 to May 2010), LILACS (from January 1982 to May 2010) and the Chinese Biomedical Retrieval System (January 1978 to May 2010) for randomised controlled trials using 'Bell's palsy' and its synonyms, 'idiopathic facial paralysis' or 'facial palsy' as well as search terms including 'acupuncture'. Chinese journals in which we thought we might find randomised controlled trials relevant to our study were handsearched. We reviewed the bibliographies of the randomised trials and contacted the authors and known experts in the field to identify additional published or unpublished data.</P>

<P>The literature search and handsearching identified 49 potentially relevant articles. Of these, six RCTs were included involving 537 participants with Bell's palsy. Two more possible trials were identified in the update than the previous version of this systematic review, but both were excluded because they were not real RCTs. Of the six included trials, five used acupuncture while the other one used acupuncture combined with drugs. No trial reported on the outcomes specified for this review. Harmful side effects were not reported in any of the trials. Poor quality caused by flaws in study design or reporting (including uncertain method of randomisation, allocation concealment and blinding) and clinical differences between trials prevented reliable conclusions about the efficacy of acupuncture.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2010-05-10 17:28:47 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Angela Gunn">
<P>Bell's palsy or idiopathic facial palsy is a unilateral, lower motor neuron facial paralysis, which is acute in onset. It is the most common disorder affecting the facial nerves and results in weakness or paralysis on one side of the face. The paralysis causes distortion of facial features and interferes with normal functions, such as closing the eye and eating. Adour et al. (<LINK REF="REF-Adour-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Adour 1978</LINK>) advocated making a diagnosis based on the history and clinical symptoms including the presence of taste and the absence of hearing problems. May and Klein (<LINK REF="REF-May-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">May 1991</LINK>) recommended excluding other diagnostic entities based on a defined workup and a lengthy differential diagnosis.</P>
<P>Studies of incidence have been carried out in the United States and in Japan (<LINK REF="REF-Brandenburg-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brandenburg 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Katusic-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Katusic 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Yanagihara-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yanagihara 1988</LINK>). All relied on retrospective examination of hospital and clinic records to ascertain cases and are likely to have underestimated the frequency of mild cases that remained undiagnosed or were treated in primary care. Crude incidence rates in these studies were similar: in Rochester, Minnesota, USA, annual incidence was 25 per 100,000 population; in Laredo, Texas, USA, 23.5 per 100,000 in men and 32.7 per 100,000 in women; and in the Ehime prefecture, Japan, 30 per 100,000 population. Rates for men and women were similar in Rochester and in the Ehime prefecture. The peak incidence lies between 20 and 40 years of age. Both sides of the face are affected equally (<LINK REF="REF-Martyn-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Martyn 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Prescott-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Prescott 1988</LINK>).</P>
<P>Etiology and pathophysiology are heavily disputed. A viral infection, vascular ischemia, autoimmune inflammation and heredity have been proposed as the underlying cause (<LINK REF="REF-Adour-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Adour 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Burgess-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burgess 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lorber-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lorber 1996</LINK>). From observations with the polymerase chain reaction to detect viral DNA, a herpes simplex virus mediated viral inflammatory immune mechanism has become more widely accepted as the cause (<LINK REF="REF-Jackson-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jackson 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>The prognosis is on the whole favourable. Jabor reported that 84% showed satisfactory recovery without any treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Jabor-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jabor 1996</LINK>). One of the largest series of people with Bell's palsy, including those who were not receiving specific therapy, also showed that 85% of participants began to recover within three weeks after onset (<LINK REF="REF-Peitersen-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Peitersen 1982</LINK>). However 15% suffer moderate to severe sequelae. Prognosis is influenced by age and time until first sign of recovery. Prognostic testing currently involves various electrophysiological tests. Degeneration of more than 90% of the facial nerve carries a poor prognosis for recovery (<LINK REF="REF-Jabor-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jabor 1996</LINK>). Logistic regression analysis (<LINK REF="REF-Katusic-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Katusic 1986</LINK>) suggested that the most important predictors of incomplete recovery were complete facial weakness, pain other than in or around the ear, and systemic hypertension.</P>
<P>Controversy remains regarding the effectiveness of commonly used pharmacologic therapies, steroids and aciclovir. Since a viral cause has long been postulated aciclovir would seem to be a promising drug, but studies have not adequately assessed its use (<LINK REF="REF-Adour-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Adour 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jabor-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jabor 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jackson-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jackson 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McCormick-1972" TYPE="REFERENCE">McCormick 1972</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Murakami-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Murakami 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Allen-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Allen 2004</LINK>). Two systematic reviews concluded that Bell's palsy could be effectively treated with corticosteroids in the first seven days (<LINK REF="REF-Grogan-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grogan 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ramsey-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ramsey 2000</LINK>). One found that participants treated with combined aciclovir and prednisone had a better outcome than those treated with prednisone alone (<LINK REF="REF-Grogan-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grogan 2001</LINK>). However in the Cochrane systematic review, the available evidence from randomised controlled trials did not show significant benefit from corticosteroids (<LINK REF="REF-Salinas-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Salinas 2004</LINK>). Surgical decompression for Bell's palsy has been proposed for people who have had electroneurography that demonstrates a compound muscle action potential amplitude decrease greater than 90% and who are in a time window roughly two to three weeks after the onset of paralysis (<LINK REF="REF-Fisch-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fisch 1981</LINK>).</P>
<P>According to Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) facial paralysis is known as 'deviated mouth'. It was attributed to 'wind' by past dynasties. 'Qi' refers to the vital substances comprising the human body and the physiological functions of viscera and bowels, channels and collaterals. It maintains life activities and reflects the resistance of the human body. Deficiency of 'qi' allows the invasion of exogenous pathogenic wind. Acupuncture is part of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) and dates back thousands of years. It involves inserting fine needles into specific points on the skin or applying various other techniques to the acupuncture points to bring about healing. In Bell's palsy, acupuncture treatment is thought to regulate channels and collaterals, harmonize qi and blood, strengthen the body's resistance to pathogenic factors, increase the excitability of the nerve, promote regeneration of the nerve fibers and formation of its collateral branches, enhance muscle contraction and blood circulation, and accelerate metabolism and recovery of body functions (<LINK REF="REF-He-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">He 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ren-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ren 1994</LINK>). A number of studies especially in China have suggested a good therapeutic effect of acupuncture on facial palsy. The literature reports a lowest cure rate of 37% and a highest of 100%, averaging 81% (<LINK REF="REF-He-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">He 1995</LINK>). This conclusion is from a non-systematic review of over 50 articles. However, the authors did not examine the quality of studies included in their review, so the results may be affected by the inclusion of studies of poor quality. Systematic review of acupuncture in the treatment of Bell's palsy is needed.</P>
<P>Since publication of the first version of this Cochrane review in 2006, some possibly relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs) have been published and the assessment methodology has improved, necessitating update of this review.</P>

</CRIT_STUDIES>
<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>We included all participants with Bell's palsy of all degrees of severity within 14 days from onset. Bell's palsy was preferably defined according to clinical diagnostic criteria as idiopathic lower motor neuron facial paralysis of sudden onset (one to two days) without other pathology. Chronic sequelae and cases of facial paralysis involving diabetes, herpes zoster or other causes of facial paralysis were not included. </P>
</CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>We included all types of acupuncture treatment and all types of control intervention including placebo, no acupuncture and any other intervention. Acupuncture was limited to the stimulation of acupuncture points at classical meridian points and trigger points by needle insertion. Although derived from needle acupuncture, methods of stimulating acupuncture points other than needle insertion, e.g. acupressure or surface electrodes or laser acupuncture, are quite different in manipulation and tools used, so these techniques were excluded. If sham acupuncture was used, it was defined as the superficial needling of non-acupuncture points without needle manipulation, done either proximally or distally to the true acupuncture points or both.</P>

<STUDY_SELECTION MODIFIED="2008-05-05 17:54:50 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Titles and abstracts identified from the register were scrutinized by two review authors. The full texts of all potentially relevant studies were obtained for independent assessment by the review authors. The review authors decided which trials fitted the inclusion criteria. Disagreements about inclusion criteria were resolved by discussion between the review authors.</P>
</STUDY_SELECTION>
<DATA_EXTRACTION MODIFIED="2010-02-18 18:03:13 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Data on participants, methods, interventions, outcomes and results were extracted by two review authors independently and then were entered into Review Manager (RevMan 5). Missing data were obtained from the trial authors whenever possible.</P>
<P>The assessment of adequacy of the acupuncture treatment was extracted to document whether 'de qi' was elicited. 'De qi' also known as 'needling sensation', refers to induction of channel qi after the needle is inserted. During the 'needling sensation' participants may feel soreness, numbness, distension, heaviness around the point, or coldness, warmness, itching, pain and the feeling of an electric shock. The operator may feel tenseness and a dragging sensation around the needle. It is used by many TCM practitioners as a confirmatory signal of successfully needling a point.</P>

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2010-05-11 16:33:04 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Ruth Brassington">
<P>The assessment of risk of bias has taken into account the security of randomisation, allocation concealment, blinding, completeness of outcome data, selective outcome reporting, and any other potential sources of bias. These items were assessed by two authors independently according to the Cochrane Collaboration standard scheme. Then all included trials were judged for each item. In all cases 'Yes' indicated a low risk of bias, 'No' a high risk of bias and 'Unclear' that there was insufficient detail to assess risk of bias or the entry was not relevant to the study.  </P>
<P>Disagreement between the review authors was resolved by discussion.</P>
</QUALITY_ASSESSMENT>
<BIAS_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2008-05-05 17:56:53 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We would have used a funnel plot to investigate the possibility of publication bias. Effect size would have been plotted against study size in a graphical display, which would give some indication whether or not some studies with particular study and effect size combination had not been published or located.</P>
</BIAS_ASSESSMENT>
<DATA_SYNTHESIS MODIFIED="2010-03-17 09:49:30 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Ruth Brassington">
<P>RevMan 5 software was used for the statistical analysis. If meta-analysis was possible, results of clinically and statistically homogeneous trials were to be pooled to provide estimates of the efficacy of acupuncture in Bell's palsy. We would have analysed all the primary and secondary outcomes under consideration. Results were expressed as relative risks (RRs) for dichotomous outcomes and as mean differences (MDs) for continuous outcomes, both with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). For trials that were clinically heterogeneous or presented insufficient information for pooling, a descriptive analysis was performed.</P>
<P>To avoid unit-of-analysis error resulting from combining results of more than one time point for each study in a standard meta-analysis, we would have defined several different outcomes based on different periods of follow-up (specially on three and six months after disease onset) and performed separate analyses. While for studies that compared more than two intervention groups, we would have selected the relevant pair of intervention groups to include in the analyses.<U>

<P>In the first included study (<LINK REF="STD-Shao-1999a" TYPE="STUDY">Shao 1999a</LINK>), 108 participants between the ages of 42 and 78 were randomly assigned to an experimental or control group. In both groups the participants were treated with dexamethasone, vitamin B1, vitamin B12, CDP-vitamin Bp (cytidinediphosphocholine-vitamin Bp, a specific form of vitamin Bp used for cerebral circulation deterioration. Other names include: CDP-choline). In the experimental group, the treatment consisted of selecting four to five points from Taiyang (EX-HN 5), Xiaguan (ST7), Jiache (ST6), Dicang (ST4), Quanliao (SI 18), Yifeng (SJ 17) and Yingxiang (LI 20), and one to two points from Hegu (LI 4), Fenglong (ST40), Zusanli (ST36), Taichong (LR 3), then inserting from between five and seven needles. The manipulation and duration of application were not described. The intervention took place once daily for a total of three courses at four-day intervals. The length of one course was 15 days. Outcomes were assessed before the intervention and at the end of last intervention.</P>
<P>The first study (<LINK REF="STD-Shao-1999a" TYPE="STUDY">Shao 1999a</LINK>) compared two groups: (a) Group 1, the experimental group (acupuncture combined with drugs dexamethasone, vitamin B1, vitamin B12, CDP-vitamin Bp and ribavirin) and (b) Group 2, the control group (the same drugs as used in experimental group). The experimental group was treated with acupuncture at five to seven specific documented points combined with drugs. The control group received exactly the same drug therapy as the experimental group. In the experimental group, the cure rate was 52% (30 cases), the markedly effective rate was 26% (15 cases), the effective rate was 21% (12 cases), the ineffective rate was 2% (one case) and the total effective rate was 98% (57 cases). This was compared with the control group where the cure rate was 12% (six cases), 54% markedly effective rate (27 cases), 20% effective rate (10 cases), 14% ineffective rate (seven cases) and 86% total effective rate (43 cases) respectively. A significant difference was found between the experimental and placebo groups in the cure rate (P &lt; 0.01) and total effective rate (P &lt; 0.05). The study indicated that the therapeutic effect in the experiment group was much better than that in the control group.<BR/>

</U>In the second included study (<LINK REF="STD-Liu-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Liu 1996</LINK>), 130 participants between the ages of eight and 75 were randomly assigned to an experimental or control group. In the experimental group, the treatment consisted of inserting up to 12 needles (30 x 45 mm) into various points: Yangbai (BL 14), Sibai (ST2), Jingming (BL 1), Quanliao (SI 18), Taiyang (EX-HN 5), Zanzhu (BL 2), Tongziliao (GB 1), Yifeng (SJ 17), Dicang (ST4), Yingxiang (LI 20), Fengchi (GB 20) and Hegu (LI 4). The length of application was 30 minutes. The needles were manipulated to achieve 'De qi'. The control group was administered deltacortone, vitamin B and Dibazol. Outcomes were assessed before the intervention and at the end of last intervention. The cure rate, effective rate, ineffective rate and total effective rate in the experimental group were 74% cure rate (48 cases), 23% effective rate (15 cases), 3% ineffective rate (two cases) and 97% total effective rate (63 cases) respectively, while in the control group they were 45% cure rate (30 cases), 31% effective rate (20 cases), 23% ineffective rate (15 cases) and 77% total effective rate (50 cases) respectively. The statistical data showed there was a significant difference between the experimental and the control group in each of the study outcomes (P &lt; 0.01) such that the therapeutic effect in the acupuncture group was superior to that of the drug group.<BR/>
<BR/>In the third included study (<LINK REF="STD-Yu-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Yu 1999</LINK>), 50 participants between the age of 17 and 78 were randomly assigned to an experimental or control group. In the experimental group, the treatment consisted of inserting up to eight needles (40 mm length) at an angle of 45 degrees to the skin surface from Sizhukong (SJ 23) to Taiyang (EX-HN 5), from Yangbai (BL 14) to Yuyao (EX-HN 4), from Sibai (ST2) to Dicang (ST4), from Xiaguan (ST7) to Jiache (ST6), from Yingxiang (LI 20) to Jingming (BL 1), from Dicang (ST4) to Jiache (ST6), from Renzhong (DU,GV 36) to Dicang (ST4), and from Yifeng (SJ 17) to Jiache (ST6). The length of application was 20 minutes. Strong stimulation was applied at the moment of inserting and withdrawing. The control group was administered Chinese medicine (details not reported), vitamin B, and steroid treatment. Outcomes were assessed before the intervention and at the end of last intervention. In the experimental group, the cure rate was 83.3% (25 cases), the effective rate was 16.7% (five cases) and total effective rate 100% (30 cases) were respectively higher than those of the control group: cure rate 45% (nine cases), effective rate 10% (two cases) and total effective rate 55% (11 cases), showing a statistically significant difference (P &lt; 0.01) in favour of acupuncture.</P>
<P>In the fourth included study (<LINK REF="STD-Ma-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Ma 2004</LINK>), 95 HIV antibody positive participants with facial paralysis were randomly assigned to acupuncture, moxibustion, acupuncture plus moxibustion or control group. In the acupuncture group, the treatment consisted of inserting up to 13 needles (40 mm length) in the Yangbai (BL 14), Sibai (ST2), Yifeng (SJ 17), Qianzheng (EX-HN 17),Yingxiang (LI 20), Dicang (ST4), Jiache (ST6), Qihai (RN6),and Guanyuan (RN4) points on the paralytic side and Hegu (LI 4), Zusanli (ST36) points on both sides. The needles were manipulated until 'De qi' was achieved. The length of application was 30 minutes. The control group received an intramuscular injection of vitamin B1 and B12. The intervention took place once daily for a total of six courses at two-day intervals. The length of one course is five days.The outcome measures were assessed before the start of the intervention and two days after last intervention.</P>
<P>The experimental group was treated with acupuncture at 13 specific documented points. The control group received Vitamin B therapy. In the experimental group, the cure rate was 63%, effective rate 27%, ineffective rate 10%, total effective rate 90% compared with control group 17%, 40%,43% and 57%. A significant difference was found between the experimental and control groups in the cure rate (P &lt; 0.01) and total effective rate (P &lt; 0.01). The study indicated that the therapeutic effect in the experiment group was much better than that in the control group.</P>
<P>In the fifth included study (<LINK REF="STD-Li-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Li 2005</LINK>), 94 participants between the age of six and 65 were randomly assigned to an experimental or control group. In the experimental group, the treatment consisted of inserting up to 11 needles in the skin surface from the Dicang (ST4) to Jiache (ST6) point, from the Yangbai (BL 14) to Yuyao (EX-HN 4) point, and inserting a needle in the Cuanzhu (BL2), Taiyang (EX-HN 5), Yingxiang (LI 20), Xianguan (ST7), Yifeng (SJ 17), Hegu (LI 4) and Taichong (LR3) points. The length of application was 20 minutes. Stimulation was applied by electric current (electronic acupuncture). The control group was given Chinese traditional manipulation, which consisted of finger massaging the Dicang (ST4), Jiache (ST6), Yangbai (BL 14),Yuyao (EX-HN 4), Cuanzhu (BL2),Taiyang (EX-HN 5), Yingxiang (LI 20), Xianguan (ST7), Yifeng (SJ 17), and Hegu (LI 4) points. The intervention took place once daily for a total of four courses at two-day intervals. The length of one course was five days. The outcome measures were assessed before the start of the intervention and two days after the last intervention. The cure rate, markedly effective rate, effective rate, ineffective rate and total effective rate in the experimental group were 62.5%, 25%, 12.5%, 0% and 100% respectively, while in the control group 63%, 28%, 9%, 0% and 100%. The statistical data showed there was no significant difference between the experimental and the control group in each item of the study outcomes (P &gt; 0.05).</P>
<P>In the sixth included study (<LINK REF="STD-Yang-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Yang 2001</LINK>), 60 participants between the age of 15 and 58 were randomly assigned to an experimental or control group. In the control group, the treatment consisted of putting surface electrodes at the Hegu (LI 4), Jiache (ST6), Dicang (ST4), Xianguan ( ST7), Yifeng (SJ 17), Taiyang (EX-HN 5) and Sibai (ST2) points. Stimulation was applied by using an electric current. The length of application was two minutes. In the experimental group the treatment consisted of inserting up to nine needles (40 mm length) from Dicang (ST4) to Jiache (ST6) point, from Yangbai (BL 14) to Yuyao (EX-HN 4) point respectively, and inserting a needle in the Yingxiang (LI 20), Xianguan (ST7), Sibai (ST2),Yifeng (SJ 17) and Hegu (LI 4) points on the paralytic side. The needles were manipulated until 'De qi' was achieved and then stimulation was applied by using electric current (electronic acupuncture). The length of application was 30 minutes.The intervention took place once daily for a total of 21 days. Outcomes were assessed before the intervention and at the end of the last intervention. The experimental group was treated by putting surface electrodes at six specific documented points and by using an electric current. The control group received acupuncture at seven specific documented points. In the experimental group, the cure rate was 23.3%, effective rate 76.7%, ineffective rate 0%, total effective rate 100% compared with the control group 13.3%, 87.6%, 0% and 100% on the 14th day after treatment. A significant difference was found between the experimental and control groups in the cure rate (P &lt; 0.05) but no significant difference was found in the total effective rate (P &lt; 0.05). In the experimental group, the cure rate (93.3%), effective rate (6.7%) and the total effective rate (100%) were respectively similar with those of the control group (cure rate 90.0%, effective rate 10.0% and total effective rate 100%) on the 21st day, showing no statistically significant difference (P &gt; 0.05). The study indicated that the therapeutic effect in the experimental group was similar to that in the control group.<BR/>

<P>The trials included methodological and/or reporting shortcomings. Randomisation was stated to be performed for all trials, but the method of random sequence generation was reported for only one of the included trials (<LINK REF="STD-Li-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Li 2005</LINK>). Methods of allocation concealment were unclear for all studies, as no explicit statements about concealment were reported in trials. Blinding could not be performed to patients or curers, since treating methods were so different between groups and no sham treatment was used in any study. Whether treating measures were blinded to efficacy evaluators was unclear.The completeness of follow-up was not reported in any one of the six articles, but from the numbers of patients authors reported from the beginning to the end of each trial, we might think none was lost during follow-up. In all 6 included studies, outcomes prespecified in their protocols were recovery of facial paralysis evaluated by clinical criteria, and all were reported. So they were free of selective reporting. Only Yu et al (<LINK REF="STD-Yu-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Yu 1999</LINK>) and Yang et al (<LINK REF="STD-Yang-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Yang 2001</LINK>) reported that baseline differences between groups were not significant.

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2010-04-08 18:59:21 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Ruth Brassington">
<P>Six RCTs with a total of 537 participants, comparing acupuncture with other forms of therapy for Bell's palsy or idiopathic facial palsy, met the inclusion criteria for this review. None of these trials reported on the outcomes specified for this review. The research methods (method of allocation sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding and completeness of outcome data) were not clearly outlined in any of the trials. The outcome measures used were not currently recognised and did not provide strong objective data. Moreover, the trials varied greatly with respect to the precise nature of the acupuncture intervention, study duration and the method of outcome assessment. Although the authors of the trials reported beneficial effects, the review authors consider that the conclusions from the available trials comparing acupuncture with no acupuncture or with other drugs are unreliable because of methodological shortcomings. More well-designed RCTs studying the efficacy of acupuncture among patients of different ages, with different degree or duration of Bell's palsy, are required. Assessments should be performed by blinded observers; long-term follow-ups are needed and should be reported in detail.</P>
