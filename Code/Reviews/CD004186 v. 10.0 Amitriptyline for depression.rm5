<SUMMARY>
<TITLE>Amitriptyline for depression</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Amitriptyline still has a place in the pharmacological management of depressive episodes. The findings of this systematic review showed that in comparison with control agents, amitriptyline was slightly more effective, but the burden of side-effects was greater for patients receiving it.</P>
</SUMMARY_BODY>
</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>For many years amitriptyline has been considered one of the reference compounds for the pharmacological treatment of depression. However, new tricyclic drugs, heterocyclic compounds and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors have been introduced on the market with the claim of a more favourable tolerability/efficacy profile.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>The aim of the present systematic review was to investigate the tolerability and efficacy of amitriptyline in comparison with the other tricyclic/heterocyclic antidepressants and with the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. </P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>The Cochrane Collaboration Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Controlled Trials Register (CCDANCTR-Studies) was searched on 28-11-2005. Reference lists of all included studies were checked.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Only randomised controlled trials were included. Study participants were of either sex and any age with a primary diagnosis of depression. Included trials compared amitriptyline with another tricyclic/heterocyclic antidepressant or with one of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. </P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Data were extracted using a standardised form. The number of patients undergoing the randomisation procedure, the number of patients who completed the study and the number of improved patients were extracted. In addition, group mean scores at the end of the trial on Hamilton Depression Scale or any other depression scale were extracted. In the tolerability analysis, the number of patients failing to complete the study and the number of patients complaining of side-effects were extracted.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>A total number of 194 studies were included in the review. The estimate of the overall odds ratio (OR) for responders showed that more subjects responded to amitriptyline in comparison with the control antidepressant group (OR 1.12 to 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.02 to 1.23, number needed to treat to benefit (NNTB) = 50). The estimate of the efficacy of amitriptyline and control agents on a continuous outcome revealed an effect size which also significantly favoured amitriptyline (Standardised Mean Difference (SMD) 0.13, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.23). Whilst these differences are statistically significant, their clinical significance is less clear. When the efficacy analysis was stratified by drug class, no difference in outcome emerged between amitriptyline and either tricyclic or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor comparators. The dropout rate in patients taking amitriptyline and control agents was similar; however, the estimate of the proportion of patients who experienced side-effects significantly favoured control agents in comparison with amitriptyline (OR 0.66, 95% CI 0.59 to 0.74). When the tolerability analysis was stratified by drug class, the dropout rate in patients taking amitriptyline and the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors significantly favoured the latter (OR 0.84, 95% CI 0.75 to 0.95, number needed to treat to harm (NNTH) = 40). When the responder analysis was stratified by study setting amitriptyline was more effective than control antidepressants in inpatients (OR 1.22, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.42, NNTB = 24), but not in outpatients (OR 1.01, 95%CI 0.88 to 1.17, NNTB = 200). </P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>This present systematic review indicates that amitriptyline is at least as efficacious as other tricyclics or newer compounds. However, the burden of side-effects in patients receiving it was greater. In comparison with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors amitriptyline was less well tolerated, and although counterbalanced by a higher proportion of responders, the difference was not statistically significant. </P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
</ABSTRACT>
<BODY>
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Depression is one of the major mental health problems in primary and secondary healthcare settings. It is associated with marked personal, social and economic morbidity, and creates significant demands on service providers in terms of workload. Treatment is predominantly pharmaceutical or psychological. For many years the tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) amitriptyline has been considered one of the reference compounds for the pharmacological treatment of depression. In the last thirty years, however, new tricyclic drugs, heterocyclic compounds and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, sertraline, paroxetine and citalopram have been introduced on to the market (<LINK REF="REF-Anon-1993-a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anon 1993 a</LINK>). As a result, a large number of antidepressant (AD) drugs are now available (<LINK REF="REF-Anon-1993-b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anon 1993 b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Barbui-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barbui 1999</LINK>). These new ADs have been compared with amitriptyline in many randomised controlled trials (RCTs), but evidence of advantages, in terms of tolerability and efficacy has not been clearly provided. Therefore, debate persists as to whether amitriptyline should still be considered the reference AD in the pharmacological management of depression. </P>
<P>Amitriptyline has a wide range of pharmacological actions. In addition to the increased receptor site concentration of noradrenaline and serotonin, that is thought to be relevant for the antidepressant effect, amitriptyline has some affinity for the muscarinic, histaminergic and adrenergic systems (<LINK REF="REF-Garattini-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Garattini 1988</LINK>). This affinity is considered significant for most of the side-effects of amitriptyline. Other TCAs have been shown to act on similar pathways, though to a lesser extent. From a clinical viewpoint, however, trials comparing amitriptyline to the other tricyclic/heterocyclic drugs have failed to clearly demonstrate that amitriptyline is less well tolerated, even though data suggest patients on amitriptyline complain of more side-effects than those receiving other TCAs. </P>
<P>Some data indicates amitriptyline is less well tolerated in comparison with SSRIs. Systematic reviews comparing the tolerability of TCAs versus SSRIs in terms of patients who fail to complete the study demonstrated a modest advantage of SSRIs in total discontinuation rates (<LINK REF="REF-Anderson-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anderson 1995</LINK>). The Canadian Coordinating Office for Health Technology Assessment showed that drop-out rates due to adverse events were 2% lower for SSRIs (<LINK REF="REF-CCOHTA-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">CCOHTA 1997</LINK>). The comparison of SSRIs with old tricyclics (imipramine and amitriptyline), newer tricyclics (dothiepin, nortriptyline, desipramine, clomipramine and doxepin) and heterocyclic antidepressants (bupropion, mianserin, trazodone, maprotiline, amineptine and nomifensine) showed a lower discontinuation rate of the SSRIs only against amitriptyline and imipramine (<LINK REF="REF-Hotopf-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hotopf 1997</LINK>), thus providing evidence that SSRIs are better tolerated than these two old tricyclic antidepressants.</P>
<P>The evidence of the disadvantage of amitriptyline in terms of dropouts against SSRIs must however be weighed against possible advantages in terms of efficacy. Perry (<LINK REF="REF-Perry-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Perry 1996</LINK>) reviewed the Hamilton scores in trials comparing TCAs with SSRIs and found TCAs more effective than SSRIs in patients suffering from severe depression with melancholic features. Similar conclusions were reached by Joffe (<LINK REF="REF-Joffe-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Joffe 1996</LINK>), who found a nonsignificant advantage of TCAs against SSRIs in terms of effect size, and by Anderson (<LINK REF="REF-Anderson-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anderson 2000</LINK>), who showed that TCAs appeared more effective in inpatients but not in outpatients with depression.</P>
<P>The present meta-analysis, which is the updated Cochrane version of a previously published systematic review (<LINK REF="REF-Barbui-2001a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barbui 2001a</LINK>) was undertaken to test whether amitryptiline is less well tolerated than tricyclic/heterocyclic drugs and SSRIs, and to investigate whether this disadvantage might be counterbalanced by a better efficacy profile. The possible contribution of study setting on treatment outcome was also investigated.</P>

</CRIT_STUDIES>
<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>Study participants were of either sex and any age with a primary diagnosis of depression. Studies adopting any criteria to define patients suffering from depression were included; in addition, a concurrent diagnosis of another psychiatric disorder was not considered an exclusion criteria. AD trials in depressive patients with a concomitant medical illness were not included in this review.</P>
</CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>Included trials compared amitriptyline with another tricyclic/heterocyclic AD or with one of the SSRIs (fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, sertraline, paroxetine, citalopram).</P>
</CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<CRIT_OUTCOMES>
<P>Efficacy was evaluated using the following outcome measures: <BR/>(1) number of patients to respond to treatment out of the total number of randomised patients (intention-to-treat analysis); <BR/>(2) group mean scores at the end of the trial on Hamilton Depression Scale (HMD)(<LINK REF="REF-Hamilton-1960" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hamilton 1960</LINK>), or Montgomery Depression Scale (MADRS)(<LINK REF="REF-Montgomery-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Montgomery 1979</LINK>), or any depression scale. </P>
<P>Tolerability was evaluated using the following outcome measures: <BR/>(1) numbers of patients dropping out during the trial as a proportion of the total number of randomised patients; <BR/>(2) numbers of patients complaining of side-effects out of the total number of randomised patients. </P>

</B>
<BR/>Two reviewers independently extracted the number of patients undergoing the randomisation procedure, the number of patients who failed to complete the study and that of patients complaining side-effects. The number of improved patients was extracted in agreement with the definition of responders adopted in the primary studies. When authors did not report any definition of responders, the number of patients showing a 50% reduction in the HMD or MADRS scale was extracted; if these figures were not available, we extracted the number of patients categorised as "much improved" and "improved" at the Clinical Global Impression (CGI), or the number of patients in the corresponding categories at any other rating scale. </P>
<P>
<B>
<I>Continuous outcomes </I>
</B>
<BR/>The mean scores at endpoint, the standard deviation (SD) or standard error (SE) of these values, and the number of patients included in these analyses, were extracted. Data were extracted from the HMD. If this scale was not available, data were extracted from the MADRS. If both the HMD and MADRS were not available, data were extracted from any other depression scale. When only the SE was reported, it was converted into SD according to <LINK REF="REF-Altman-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Altman 1996</LINK>. </P>

<BR/>The primary analysis used a fixed effect approach, the Peto Odds Ratio. In addition, a random-effects estimate, which takes accounts of any additional between-study variation, was calculated using a moment estimator of the between-study variance (<LINK REF="REF-Der-Simonian-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Der Simonian 1986</LINK>) as a sensitivity check on the fixed-effect estimate. </P>
<P>Tolerability data were analysed by calculating the proportion of patients who failed to complete the study and who experienced adverse reactions out of the total number of randomised patients. </P>
<P>A standardised mean difference (SMD) was estimated for each continuous outcome. This measure provides the effect size of the intervention in units of standard deviations. Scores from different outcome scales can be summarized in an overall SMD. </P>
<P>
<B>
<I>Management of missing data</I>
</B>
<BR/>Responders to treatment were calculated including drop-outs in the analysis, on an intention-to-treat basis. When data on drop-outs were carried forward and included in the efficacy evaluation (Last Observation Carried Forward, LOCF), they were analysed according to the primary studies; when dropouts were excluded from any assessment in the primary studies they were considered as drug failures (both in the amitriptyline and comparator arms). Scores from continuous outcomes were analysed including patients with a final assessment or with a last observation carried forward to the final assessment. </P>
<P>
<B>
<I>Exploration of heterogeneity and subgroup analyses</I>
</B>
<BR/>Heterogeneity of treatment effect between studies was formally tested using the Chi Square statistic. A subgroup and meta-regression analysis was carried out using the statistical software STATA 7.0. We investigated the extent that study setting predicted size of treatment effect on response and drop-out. For the purposes of this analysis, studies carried out in psychiatric wards of general hospitals or in psychiatric hospitals and studies that recruited inpatients in these facilities and followed them up on an outpatient basis were considered RCTs in inpatients. Studies carried out in outpatient psychiatric settings (public or private facilities) or among general practice patients or in any other outpatient services were considered RCTs in outpatients.</P>

<STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<P>
<B>Design and setting </B>
<BR/>A total number of 227 RCTs met the inclusion criteria; of these, 33 studies were excluded for the reasons listed in the Table of Excluded Studies. Of the 194 remaining studies, 147 RCTs compared amitriptyline with another TCA or related AD, and 47 RCTs compared amitriptyline with one of the SSRIs. In six studies amitriptyline was administered in combination with perphenazine and in two studies in combination with chlordiazepoxide. In two studies a single blind approach was followed, five studies were not blind, and in other seven studies blindness was not clear. The mean and median sample size was 81.7 patients (SD 81.3) and 51 patients, respectively. The mean and median length of follow-up was 5.2 weeks (SD 2.22) and 5 weeks, respectively. A total of 54 studies was conducted in inpatient psychiatric settings, whilst 70 were conducted in outpatient settings. In the remaining studies patients were enrolled either in both in and outpatient settings (27 studies), or in a general practice setting (24 studies). The setting was unclear in 19 studies.<BR/>
<B>
<BR/>Participants </B>
<BR/>Most of the included trials enrolled patients suffering from major depression. Five studies enrolled patients with bipolar affective disorder during a depressive episode, whilst six and two trials enrolled patients with mixed anxiety-depressive syndrome and dysthymic disorder, respectively. In about 27% of the trials the Diagnostic Statistical Manual of Mental Disorder (DSM) criteria were followed to make the diagnosis (<LINK REF="REF-APA-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">APA 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-APA-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">APA 1994</LINK>). The Research Diagnostic Criteria (RDC) (<LINK REF="REF-Spitzer-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spitzer 1977</LINK>), the Feighner (<LINK REF="REF-Feighner-1972" TYPE="REFERENCE">Feighner 1972</LINK>) criteria and the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1974" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1974</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1992</LINK>) criteria were also used. Fifty three per cent of the studies adopted implicit diagnostic criteria. The severity of illness at baseline was measured with the Hamilton Depression Scale (HMD) or the Montgomery scale (MADRS). The study population mostly involved patients aged between 18 and 65, although in some trials patients above 65 were enrolled. </P>
</STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<STUDY_QUALITY>
<P>A formal quality assessment was performed using the Quality Rating Scale (QRS) (<LINK REF="REF-Moncrieff-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moncrieff 2001</LINK>). The rating system is such that the higher the score, the higher is the quality of the trial. Overall QRS scores for the total sample ranged from 8 to 32, out of a maximum of 46. The mean QRS score was 18.0 (SD 3.99), indicating an average medium/low quality of included RCTs. The mean QRS score for studies comparing amitriptyline with other TCA or related ADs was 17.2 (SD 3.71), and the same figure for studies comparing amitriptyline with the SSRIs was 20.3 (SD 3.94), indicating a higher quality in the latter group of studies (z -4.36, p &lt; .001). </P>
<P>Of the 194 RCTs included, only 12 reported a method for concealing allocation. In seven of the 12 RCTs the allocation concealment was inadequate, while in the remaining five it was not used. With regard to blindness, in six RCTs blinding was not clear, and in nine RCTs procedure was single blind only. In the remaining RCTs, double blind was clearly indicated. </P>

</B>With regards to responders, a total number of 104 RCTs contributed to this analysis, with 7422 patients included (Graph 01.01). The estimate of the overall odds ratio for responders showed that more subjects responded to amitriptyline in comparison with the control AD group (odds ratio (OR) 1.12, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.02 to 1.23). Test for heterogeneity was performed (Chi<SUP>2</SUP>=120.40, df= 103 (p=0.12), I<SUP>2</SUP>=14.4%). The Number Needed to Treat to Benefit (NNTB) was 50 subjects. The estimate of the efficacy of amitriptyline and control ADs on continuous measures of depression (Graph 01.04), performed on 2004 and 2015 subjects respectively, included 53 studes and revealed an effect size which also significantly favoured amitriptyline (Standardised Mean Difference (SMD) 0.13, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.23).

<BR/>On treatment response, amitriptyline resulted more effective than control ADs in inpatients (OR 1.22, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.42, NNTB = 24), but not in outpatients (OR 1.01, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.17, NNTB = 200). Among inpatients amitriptyline was significantly more effective than TCAs (OR 1.20, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.42) and non-significantly more effective than SSRIs (OR 1.30, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.96). Among outpatients no statistically significant differences emerged between amitriptyline and TCAs (OR 0.98, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.17) and between amitriptyline and SSRIs (OR 1.08, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.35).</P>

Among outpatients amitriptyline was significantly less well tolerated in comparison with SSRIs (OR 0.77, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.89) but not in comparison with TCAs (OR 1.03, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.19). </P>
<P>The predictive effect of study setting on responders and dropouts is presented in Table 01. A positive estimate indicates that the factors included in the meta-regression model predicted a statistically significant advantage (in terms of responders or dropouts) for amitriptyline in comparison with control ADs; a negative estimate indicates that the factors included in the meta-regression model predicted a statistically significant disadvantage for amitriptyline in comparison with control ADs. In comparison with studies carried out in inpatients, studies carried out in psychiatric outpatient settings predicted a statistically significant disadvantage for amitriptyline over control AD in terms of treatment responders. Given the fact that subgroup analysis should be interpreted with caution, the findings on the differences between in-patients and out-patients are exploratory.</P>
</INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>This present systematic review of clinical trials comparing amitriptyline with all other AD drugs indicates that overall amitriptyline is slightly more efficacious than the pooled results of other TCA or newer compounds. For the efficacy analysis of continuous measures of depression, the SMD significantly favoured amitriptyline over control ADs. However, this analysis only included patients with a final assessment or patients whose efficacy data were carried forward to the final assessment. Thus patients who dropped out of treatment were often excluded. This would have had the effect of favouring amitriptyline. For the analysis of the binary outcome (responders versus non-reponders) dropouts were assumed to have failed to improve. This conservative approach, which theoretically takes into consideration efficacy and tolerability within the same outcome measure, yielded an odds ratio which indicated a small but significant advantage for amitriptyline over control ADs. When this analysis was stratified by drug class, the effect size was similar, but was no longer statistically significant because of the smaller sample sizes included in each subgroup analysis.</P>
<P>Amitriptyline was less well tolerated than SSRIs, but this disadvantage was counterbalanced by a slightly higher proportion of responders, yielding a no difference in outcome in terms of responders. In practical terms this suggests that the proportion of improved patients after six to eight weeks of therapy is very similar for amitriptyline and the SSRIs, even taking into consideration the higher dropout rate associated with amitriptyline. Despite this, amitriptyline was found to be associated with more side-effects, as can be seen by the proportion of subjects who complained adverse reactions during the study period, which was significantly higher in comparison with the SSRIs.</P>
<P>Amitriptyline showed a more favourable profile over control agents in inpatients but not in outpatients. Inpatients with depression responded better to amitriptyline than control TCA or SSRI, although the difference in comparison with SSRIs, calculated on a small number of studies, was not statistically significant. In terms of dropouts, amitriptyline was not less well tolerated either in comparison with control TCA or SSRI. These findings are in agreement with those provided by Anderson (<LINK REF="REF-Anderson-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anderson 1998</LINK>), who showed that among inpatients with depression TCA resulted more effective than SSRIs, and that overall treatment discontinuation rates were not significantly different. In outpatients with depression, in contrast, amitriptyline was not more effective than control agents and resulted less well tolerated. The role of RCT setting was further confirmed by the meta-regression model, which demonstrated that studies carried out in inpatients were associated with a significant advantage of amitriptyline over control agents in terms of treatment responders. However, no significant associations emerged when treatment dropouts were entered in the model as the dependent variable.</P>
<P>This study has limitations. Firstly, the findings on dropout rates in this meta-analysis should be interpreted with care, as reasons for dropping out were not given in a high proportion of trials. There are many different reasons for dropping-out of treatment, and therefore this measure might be an oversimplification of the true tolerability of amitriptyline. Some studies reported the proportion of subjects who discontinued the study because of side-effects or AD inefficacy or because of other reasons. These figures were not extracted and analysed because reasons for dropping out were given in some studies only, and in many of these studies they were reported for some drop-out patients only. Secondly, we observed great variability in the overall quality of included studies. The quality rating showed an overall medium/low quality of studies; moreover, RCTs comparing amitriptyline with control TCA or related AD scored significantly lower than RCTs comparing amitriptyline with the SSRIs. A possible explanation of this is that the majority of studies comparing amitriptyline with other TCAs have been published in the 1960s and 1970s, while those comparing amitriptyline with the SSRIs have been published in the last 20 years. Trial methodology has changed during the last four decades, both in terms of design and statistical techniques, and this may explain the difference in the mean quality score between the two groups of studies (<LINK REF="REF-Barbui-2001b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barbui 2001b</LINK>). Another study limitation is that heterogeneity was investigated by stratifying the analysis according to study setting only; the role of other study characteristics such as length of follow-up, diagnostic criteria and outcome measures was not assessed. Although this leaves some uncertainty about the role of these independent variables in influencing the overall treatment effect, the analysis was not stratified because we would have inevitably increased the probability of detecting significant difference by chance, but also because we would have decreased the sample size of each analysis, thus increasing the possibility of detecting borderline findings of uncertain clinical relevance.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>Amitriptyline still has a role in the pharmacological management of depressive episodes. It has the edge in terms of efficacy in comparison with control ADs, but patients have to sustain a great burden of side-effects. From a clinical viewpoint the intriguing issue is to identify subgroups of subjects who could benefit from amitriptyline therapy. Some data suggest that it should be prescribed to patients suffering from severe depression with melancholia, or to patients admitted to hospital because of the severity of symptoms (<LINK REF="REF-Perry-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Perry 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Joffe-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Joffe 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Anderson-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anderson 2000</LINK>). The present review, by showing a more favourable profile of amitriptyline over control agents in inpatients but not in outpatients, supports this suggestion. On the other side, however, it seems reasonable to suggest the use of the SSRIs in patients at suicide risk, since amitriptyline and other TCAs are less safe when taken in overdose (<LINK REF="REF-Spigset-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spigset 1999</LINK>). Moreover, the cost of fluoxetine and that of other SSRIs has fallen over the last few years, both in the US and in Europe, making these compounds more cost-effective. Unfortunately, little evidence is available on the long-term efficacy and tolerability of amitriptyline versus the SSRIs. Many side-effects are often experienced at the beginning of treatment, and therefore it might be possible that amitriptyline and other TCAs could be more tolerable in the long-term. However, no data support this speculation.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Amitriptyline should still be considered a reference comparator in terms of efficacy in clinical trials of new AD drugs. Future studies, however, should adopt a higher standard in terms of design and statistical analysis. The quality rating has in fact shown that a great proportion of studies does not meet the quality requirements to provide reliable findings, especially in terms of sample size and length of follow-up. The issue of long-term treatment of depression with respect to efficacy and tolerability should definitely be addressed, as in real-life conditions patients with depression receive treatment for more than 6-12 weeks.</P>
<P>In the light of the increasing use of the SSRIs and newer compounds, future research has to clarify the position of amitriptyline and other old compounds in the pharmacological management of depressive episodes. In particular, large pragmatic RCTs should provide direct evidence on whether amitriptyline is cost-effective in special patient populations, for example hospitalised patients with severe depression.</P>
