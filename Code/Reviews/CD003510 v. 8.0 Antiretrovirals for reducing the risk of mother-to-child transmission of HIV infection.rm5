<TITLE>Antiretrovirals for reducing the risk of mother-to-child transmission of HIV infection</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2011-03-15 13:08:41 -0700" MODIFIED_BY="Tara Horvath">
<P>At the end of 2009, 2.5 million children under the age of 15 years were estimated to be living with HIV/AIDS (<A HREF="WHO 2011">WHO 2011</A>). The majority of these children acquired their infections as a result of mother-to-child transmission during pregnancy, labor, or breastfeeding. Antiretroviral drugs administered to the HIV-infected mother and/or to her child during pregnancy, labor, or breastfeeding can reduce mother-to-child transmission of HIV. The objective of this review is to determine whether a regimen of antiretroviral drugs leads to a significant reduction in HIV transmission during pregnancy and labor without serious side-effects.</P>
<P>The 25 trials found eligible for this review included 18,901 participants.The included trials compared the use of antiretrovirals versus placebo, longer regimens versus shorter regimens using the same antiretrovirals, and antiretroviral regimens using different drugs and drug combinations. This review of trials found that short courses of certain antiretroviral drugs are effective in reducing mother-to-child transmission of HIV, but are not associated with any safety concerns in the short term.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2011-03-10 23:15:38 -0800" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Antiretroviral drugs reduce viral replication and can reduce mother-to-child transmission of HIV either by lowering plasma viral load in pregnant women or through post-exposure prophylaxis in their newborns. In rich countries, highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) which usually comprises three drugs, has reduced the mother-to-child transmission rates to around 1-2%, but HAART is not always available in low- and middle-income countries. In these countries, various simpler and less costly antiretroviral regimens have been offered to pregnant women or to their newborn babies, or to both.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To determine whether, and to what extent, antiretroviral regimens aimed at decreasing the risk of mother-to-child transmission of HIV infection achieve a clinically useful decrease in transmission risk, and what effect these interventions have on maternal and infant mortality and morbidity.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2011-05-03 10:53:10 -0700" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We sought to identify all relevant studies regardless of language or publication status by searching the Cochrane HIV/AIDS Review Group Trials Register, <I>The Cochrane Library</I>, MEDLINE, EMBASE and AIDSearch and relevant conference abstracts. We also contacted research organizations and experts in the field for unpublished and ongoing studies. The original review search strategy was conducted in 2002 and updated in 2006 and again in 2009.</P>

<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2010-12-15 02:56:58 -0800" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Randomised controlled trials of any antiretroviral regimen aimed at decreasing the risk of mother-to-child transmission of HIV infection compared with placebo or no treatment, or compared with another antiretroviral regimen.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2010-12-15 02:57:15 -0800" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two authors independently selected relevant studies, extracted data and assessed trial quality. For the primary outcomes, we used survival analysis to estimate the probability of infants being infected with HIV (the observed proportion) at various specific time-points and calculated efficacy at a specific time as the relative reduction in the proportion infected. Efficacy, at a specific time, is defined as the preventive fraction in the exposed group compared to the reference group, which is the relative reduction in the proportion infected: 1-(Re/Rf). For those studies where efficacy and hence confidence intervals were not calculated, we calculated the approximate confidence intervals for the efficacy using recommended methods. For analysis of results that are not based on survival analyses we present the relative risk for each trial outcome based on the number randomised. No meta-analysis was conducted as no trial assessed identical drug regimens.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2011-05-03 11:08:25 -0700" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Twenty-five trials including 18,901 participants with a median trial sample size of 627 ranging from 50 to 1,844 participants were included in this update. Twenty-two trials randomised mothers (18 pre-natally and four in labour) and followed up their infants, and three trials randomised infants. The first trial began in April 1991 and assessed zidovudine (ZDV) versus placebo and since then, the type, dosage and duration of drugs to be compared has been modified in each subsequent trial. We present the results stratified by regimen and type of feeding.</P>
<P>
<B>Antiretrovirals versus placebo<BR/>
</B>
<BR/>In breastfeeding populations, three trials found that:</P>
<P>ZDV given to mothers from 36 to 38 weeks gestation, during labour and for 7 days after delivery significantly reduced HIV infection at 4-8 weeks (Efficacy 32.00%; 95% CI 1.50 to 62.50), 3 to 4 months (Efficacy 33.07%; 95% CI 5.57 to 60.57), 6 months (Efficacy 34.55%; 95% CI 9.05 to 60.05), 12 months (Efficacy 34.31%; 95% CI 9.30 to 59.32) and 18 months (Efficacy 29.74%; 95% CI 2.73 to 56.75).</P>
<P>ZDV given to mothers from 36 weeks gestation and during labour significantly reduced HIV infection at 4 to 8 weeks (Efficacy 43.78%; 95% CI 8.78 to 78.78) and 3 to 4 months (Efficacy 36.95%; 95% CI 2.94 to 70.96) but not at birth.</P>
<P>ZDV plus lamivudine (3TC) given to mothers from 36 weeks gestation, during labour and for 7 days after delivery and to babies for the first 7 days after birth (PETRA 'regimen A') significantly reduced HIV infection (Efficacy 62.75%; 95% CI 40.76 to 84.74) and a combined endpoint of HIV infection or death (Efficacy 62.75 [, ]61.00%; 95% CI 40.76 to 84.74) at 4 to 8 weeks but these effects were not sustained at 18 months.</P>
<P>ZDV plus 3TC given to mothers from the start of labour until 7 days after delivery and to babies for the first 7 days after birth (PETRA 'regimen B') significantly reduced HIV infection (Efficacy 41.83%; 95% CI 12.82 to 70.84) and HIV infection or death at 4 to 8 weeks (Efficacy 35.91%; 95% CI 8.41 to 63.41) but the effects were not sustained at 18 months.</P>
<P>ZDV plus 3TC given to mothers during labour only (PETRA 'regimen C') with no treatment to babies did not reduce the risk of HIV infection at either 4 to 8 weeks or 18 months.</P>
<P>In non-breastfeeding populations, three trials found that:</P>
<P>ZDV given to mothers from 14 to 34 weeks gestation and during labour and to babies for the first 6 weeks after birth significantly reduced HIV infection in babies at 18 months (Efficacy 66.22%; 95% CI 33.94 to 98.50).</P>
<P>ZDV given to mothers from 36 weeks gestation and during labour with no treatment to babies ('Thai-CDC regimen') significantly reduced HIV infection at 4 to 8 weeks (Efficacy 50.26%; 95% CI 13.80 to 86.72) but not at birth</P>
<P>ZDV given to mothers from 38 weeks gestation and during labour with no treatment to babies did not influence HIV transmission at 6 months.</P>
<P>
<B>Longer versus shorter regimens using the same antiretrovirals </B>
<BR/>
<BR/>One trial in a breastfeeding population found that:</P>
<P>ZDV given to mothers during labour and to their babies for the first 3 days after birth compared with ZDV given to mothers from 36 weeks and during labour (similar to 'Thai-CDC') resulted in HIV infection rates that were not significantly different at birth, 4-8 weeks, 3 to 4 months, 6 months and 12 months.</P>
<P>Three trials in non-breastfeeding populations found that:</P>
<P>ZDV given to mothers from 28 weeks gestation during labour and to infants for the first 3 days after birth compared with ZDV given to mothers from 35 weeks gestation through labour and to infants from birth to 6 weeks significantly reduced HIV infection rate at 6 months (Efficacy 45.35 %; 95% CI 1.39 to 89.31) but compared with the same regimen ZDV given to mothers from 28 weeks gestation through labour and to infants from birth to 6 weeks did not result in a statistically significant difference in HIV infection at 6 months. ZDV given to mothers from 35 weeks gestation during labour and to infants for the first 3 days after birth was considered ineffective for reducing transmission rates and this regimen was discontinued.</P>
<P>An antenatal/intrapartum course of ZDV used for a median of 76 days compared with an antenatal/intrapartum ZDV regimen used for a median 28 days with no treatment to babies in either group did not result in HIV infection rates that were significantly different at birth and at 3 to 4 months.</P>
<P>In a programme where mothers were routinely receiving ZDV in the third trimester of pregnancy and babies were receiving one week of ZDV therapy, a single dose of nevirapine (NVP) given to mothers in labour and to their babies soon after birth compared with a single dose of NVP given to mothers only resulted in HIV infection rates that were not significantly different at birth and 6 months. However the reduction in risk of HIV infection or death at 6 months was marginally significant (Efficacy 45.00%; 95% CI -4.00 to 94.00).</P>
<P>
<B>Antiretroviral regimens using different drugs and durations of treatment </B>
</P>
<P>In breastfeeding populations, three trials found that:</P>
<P>A single dose of NVP given to mothers at the onset of labour plus a single dose of NVP given to their babies immediately after birth ('HIVNET 012 regimen') compared with ZDV given to mothers during labour and to their babies for a week after birth resulted in lower HIV infection rates at 4-8 weeks (Efficacy 41.00%; 95% CI 11.84 to 70.16), 3-4 months (Efficacy 38.91%; 95% CI 11.24 to 66.58), 12 months (Efficacy 35.98 [9.25, 62.71]36.00%; 95% CI 8.56 to 63.44) and 18 months (Efficacy 39.15%; 95% CI 13.81 to 64.49). In addition, the NVP regimen significantly reduced the risk of HIV infection or death at 4-8 weeks (Efficacy 41.74%; 95% CI 14.30 to 69.18), 3 to 4 months (Efficacy 40.00%; 95% CI 14.34 to 65.66), 12 months (Efficacy 32.17%; 95% CI 8.51 to 55.83) and 18 months (Efficacy 32.57 [9.93, 55.21]33.00%; 95% CI 9.93 to 55.21).</P>
<P>The 'HIVNET 012 regimen' plus ZDV given to babies for 1 week after birth compared with the 'HIVNET 012 regimen' alone did not result in a statistically significant difference in HIV infection at 4 to 8 weeks.</P>
<P>A single dose of NVP given to babies immediately after birth plus ZDV given to babies for 1 week after birth compared with a single dose of NVP given to babies only significantly reduced the HIV infection rate at 4 to 8 weeks (Efficacy 36.79%; 95% CI 3.57 to 70.01).</P>
<P>Five trials in non-breastfeeding populations found that:</P>
<P>In a population in which mothers were receiving 'standard' antiretroviral for HIV infection a single dose of NVP given to mothers in labour plus a single dose of NVP given to babies immediately after birth ('HIVNET 012 regimen') compared with placebo did not result in a statistically significant difference in HIV infection rates at birth and at 4 to 8 weeks.</P>
<P>The 'Thai CDC regimen' compared with the 'HIVNET 012 regimen' did not result in a significant difference in HIV infection at 4 to 8 weeks.</P>
<P>A single dose of NVP given to babies immediately after birth compared to ZDV given to babies for the first 6 weeks after birth did not result in a significant difference in HIV infection rates at 4-8 weeks and 3 to 4 months.</P>
<P>ZDV plus 3TC given to mothers in labour and for a week after delivery and to their infants for a week after birth (similar to 'PETRA regimen B') compared with NVP given to mothers in labour and immediately after delivery plus a single dose of NVP to their babies immediately after birth (similar to 'HIVNET 012 regimen') did not result in a significant difference in the HIV infection rate at 4 to 8 weeks.</P>
<P>An evaluation of various antiretroviral drugs given to mothers from 34 to 36 weeks and during labour with the same drugs given to their babies for 6 weeks after birth: stavudine (d4T) versus ZDV, didanosine (ddI) versus ZDV and d4T plus ddI versus ZDV did not result in statistically important differences in HIV infection rates at birth, 4 to 8 weeks, 3 to 4 months and 6 months.</P>
<P>
<B>TRIPLE regimens versus other</B>
</P>
<P>Two trials compared a regimen of three antiretrovirals given to the mother, which we refer to as TRIPLE, with other regimens.</P>
<P>In a breastfeeding population, a trial of TRIPLE regimen commenced at 34 weeks compared with only ZDV for the same period until labour when sdNVP was added found no babies infected with HIV at birth in either group and at 6 months post delivery there was no statistically significant difference in HIV infection between groups (Efficacy -84.62%, 95%CI: -490.35 to 321.11). The infants in the TRIPLE group did not receive any drugs while those in the ZDV group received sdNVP at birth.</P>
<P>In a non-breastfeeding population, a trial compared a protease inhibitor-based TRIPLE regimen combination of lopinavir/ritonavir, ZDV and lamivudine from 26 to 34 weeks gestation through 6 months post-partum with a shorter regimen of ZDV from 28 to 36 weeks, then ZDV and 3TC and sdNVP at onset of labour, followed by ZDV and 3TC for one week after delivery. Infants in both groups received sdNVP within 72 hours of delivery and ZDV for one week. There was no statistically significant difference between groups in HIV infection at birth (Efficacy 18.18%, 95%CI -83.48 to 119.84) or at four to eight weeks (Efficacy 31.25%, 95%CI -29.29 to 91.79). At six months, HIV infection was higher but not statistically significantly so in the non-TRIPLE group (Efficacy 42.35%, 95%CI -0.57 to 85.27). At 12 months HIV infection was statistically significantly higher in the non-TRIPLE group (Efficacy = 42.11%, 95%CI 0.66 to 83.56). At 6 months, the HIV infection or death incidence remained higher in the non-TRIPLE group (RR 34.13, 95%CI [-0.29 to 68.55) and at 12 months this difference was statistically significant (RR 36.20, 95%CI 5.92 to 66.48).</P>
<P>
<B>TRIPLE regimen versus TRIPLE regimen</B>
</P>
<P>In a breastfeeding population, one trial compared two triple combination antiretroviral regimens with each other, viz abacavir, lamivudine and ZDV with lopinavir/ritonavir and ZDV and lamivudine in the mother from 26 to 34 weeks and continued for six months post-partum. Infants in both groups received sdNVP and one month of ZDV. This trial found no significant difference in HIV infection rates at birth (Efficacy -189.47%; 95%CI -715.29 to 336.35) with incidence at six months remaining non-significant with transmission rates being very low (&lt; 1%).</P>
<P>
<B>Adverse effects</B>
</P>
<P>The incidence of serious or life-threatening events was not significantly different in any of the trials included in this review.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2011-05-02 12:03:27 -0700" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>A regimen combining triple antiretrovirals is most effective for preventing transmission of HIV from mothers to babies. The risk of adverse events to both mother and baby appears low in the short-term but the optimal antiretroviral combination and the optimal time to initiate this to maximise prevention efficacy without compromising the health of either mother or baby remains unclear.</P>
<P>Short courses of antiretroviral drugs are also effective for reducing mother-to-child transmission of HIV and are not associated with any safety concerns in the short-term. ZDV given to mothers during the antenatal period, followed by ZDV+3TC intrapartum and postpartum for one week, and sd-NVP given to infants within 72 hours of delivery and ZDV for one week, may be most effective when considering short antiretroviral courses. Where HIV-infected women present late for delivery, post-exposure prophylaxis with a single dose of NVP immediately after birth plus ZDV for the first 6 weeks after birth is beneficial. The long term implications of the emergence of resistant mutations following the use of these regimens, especially those containing Nevirapine, require further study.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2011-05-03 11:16:16 -0700" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The World Health Organization estimated that 2.7 million people were newly infected with HIV in 2008 (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2010a" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2010a</LINK>). Of the 1.4 million HIV-positive pregnant women, more than 628 000 received antiretroviral drugs to prevent the transmission of HIV to their children. Although this represents a global increase of 10% compared with 2007, there are vast regional differences in coverage, for example only 45% of African pregnant women received treatment (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2010a" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2010a</LINK>). Babies born of HIV-infected mothers who are not on antiretrovirals for treatment or for prevention of transmission of HIV to their babies, can acquire infection during three time periods: during pregnancy, in the intrapartum period or postnatally through breast feeding. Based on a review of 13 cohort studies the risk of vertical transmission of HIV without antiretroviral treatment was estimated to be about 15-20% in Europe, 15-30% in the USA, and 25-35% in Africa (<LINK REF="REF-Working-Group-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Working Group 1995</LINK>).</P>
<P>Maternal viral load (the amount of HIV RNA in the plasma) is an independent determinant of the risk of mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) (<LINK REF="REF-John-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">John 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Khouri-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Khouri 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mofenson-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mofenson 1995</LINK>). Other risk factors for transmission include breastfeeding, sexually transmitted diseases, chorioamnionitis, prolonged rupture of membranes, vaginal mode of delivery, low CD4 count, advanced maternal HIV disease, obstetric events increasing bleeding (episiotomy, perineal laceration, and intrapartum haemorrhage), young maternal age, and history of stillbirth (<LINK REF="REF-Dunn-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dunn 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-European-Collab-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">European Collab 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jamieson-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jamieson 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Minkoff-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Minkoff 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Miotti-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Miotti 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mofenson-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mofenson 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nair-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nair 1993</LINK>).</P>
<P>Despite improvements in childhood survival globally over the past decade (<LINK REF="REF-You-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">You 2010</LINK>), HIV infection continues to contribute to infant and child mortality and in many African countries this effect is reversing gains in child survival (<LINK REF="REF-UNICEF-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">UNICEF 2010</LINK>). UNICEF reports that in Namibia, the under-five mortality rate for 2001&#8211; 2006 from the 2006 Demographic and Health Survey had to be increased from 69 deaths per 1,000 live births to 78 deaths to account for the impact of AIDS. Similar adjustments were made for 17 other countries in sub-Saharan Africa. Interventions aimed at reducing the risk of MTCT are therefore a priority if childhood mortality is to be reduced. As the greatest burden of disease due to HIV infection in pregnancy is in those parts of the world least able to afford expensive and complex interventions, it is essential that these interventions be simple and affordable and based on the best available evidence (<LINK REF="REF-Chinnock-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chinnock 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>The aims of antiretroviral drugs are to suppress the replication of HIV and thereby result in improvements in the immune system and clinical status of adults and children living with HIV/AIDS (<LINK REF="REF-Volberding-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Volberding 2010</LINK>). Antiretroviral drugs can reduce mother-to-child transmission of HIV in one or more of the following ways; 1) by reducing viral replication and thus lowering plasma viral load in pregnant women; 2) through pre-exposure prophylaxis of babies by crossing the placenta; and 3) through post-exposure prophylaxis of babies after delivery; and 4) through reducing transmission via breast-feeding. In resource-rich countries, antiretroviral regimens usually comprising at least three different drugs, has reduced the vertical transmission rates to around 1-2% but antiretrovirals are not yet widely available in low- and middle-income countries. In these countries, various simpler and less costly antiretroviral regimens have been offered to pregnant women and/or their newborn babies.</P>
<P>Antiretroviral drugs can be grouped into the following classes:</P>
<OL>
<LI>Nucleoside analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitors:</LI>
<OL>
<LI>This class of drugs includes zidovudine (ZDV, previously known as AZT), lamivudine (3TC), didanosine (ddI), stavudine (d4T) and abacavir (ABC).</LI>
</OL>
<LI>Non-nucleoside analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitors.</LI>
<OL>
<LI>This class of drugs includes nevirapine (NVP), delavirdine and efavirenz.</LI>
</OL>
<LI>Protease inhibitors.</LI>
<OL>
<LI>This class of drugs includes indinavir, ritonavir, nelfinavir and saquinavir.</LI>
</OL>
</OL>
<P>Some of the more commonly used antiretroviral drugs in pregnancy are:</P>
<P>
<I>Zidovudine</I>
<BR/>ZDV was the first antiretroviral drug to be approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in March 1987. Like all nucleoside analogues, it inhibits HIV replication by inhibiting the enzyme reverse transcriptase required for transcription of viral RNA to DNA prior to insertion into the host cell genome. It is the drug which has been most extensively used in pregnancy.</P>
<P>
<I>Nevirapine</I>
<BR/>NVP is rapidly absorbed when given orally and has potent antiretroviral activity. In addition, it has a very long half life (<LINK REF="REF-Mirochnick-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mirochnick 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Musoke-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Musoke 1999</LINK>). Prolonged use of NVP as monotherapy leads to rapid development of resistant virus, which limits its usefulness when treating HIV infection in the long term.</P>
<P>
<I>Combination antiretroviral therapy</I>
<BR/>Trials in adults have shown that combination therapy is associated with a prolonged suppression of viral replication with marked reductions in viral load as well as a delay in the emergence of viral resistance. These effects seem to be translated into clinical benefit (<LINK REF="REF-Hammer-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hammer 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Morcroft-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morcroft 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Volberding-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Volberding 2010</LINK>). As higher maternal viral loads are associated with a greater risk of mother-to-child transmission of HIV infection, any intervention that substantially reduces viral load may decrease the likelihood of mother-to-child transmission. Trials of combination antiretroviral therapy in pregnancy are necessary to weigh these potential benefits against the potential risks of exposing large numbers of uninfected fetuses to drugs of unknown toxicity or teratogenicity.</P>
<P>Development of resistance to antiretroviral drugs continues to be an important consideration when choosing the most appropriate preventive drug, or combination of drugs, for prevention of mother-to-child transmission (pMTCT). As stated above, use of NVP as a monotherapy can result in selection for HIV resistance mutations that may negatively affect the future efficacy of NVP-based therapies for those mothers who require treatment for their own health and for those of their children to whom the virus is transmitted (<LINK REF="REF-Lallemant-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lallemant 2010</LINK>). Trials with sufficiently long follow-up periods are required to determine how long resistance is sustained and the effects of such resistance on not only possible future treatment, but also prevention requirements during future pregnancies.</P>
<P>A Cochrane systematic review of all currently trialed interventions for preventing MTCT was conducted initially in 2002. The review was then updated in 2006 to focus only on antiretrovirals. This is the third update to provide timely evidence to assist policy-makers, clinicians and consumers in choosing the most effective drug regimen. The review was done as one of a series of reviews prepared at the request of the World Health Organization (WHO) to inform the development of the 2010 guidelines on preventing MTCT (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2009</LINK>). Treatment of the HIV-infected mother is addressed in a partner review (<LINK REF="REF-Sturt-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sturt 2010</LINK>). In addition to informing the WHO guidelines, this review will help identify the gaps in the research evidence and provide evidence-based direction for future trials.</P>

<SEARCH_METHODS MODIFIED="2011-05-03 11:57:18 -0700" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>See: HIV/AIDS Collaborative Review Group search strategy.</P>
<P>The original review, published in 2002, used a search strategy developed for the Pregnancy and Childbirth Group as a whole. Relevant trials were identified in the Group's Specialized Register of Controlled Trials. In addition, the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register was searched with each new edition of <I>The Cochrane Library</I>. Conference abstracts from the <I>International AIDS Conferences</I> and the <I>Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections</I> were also searched.</P>
<P>The review was updated in 2006 after refining the search strategy with the assistance of the HIV/AIDS Review Group Trials Search Co-ordinator. We formulated a comprehensive and exhaustive search strategy in an attempt to identify all relevant studies regardless of language or publication status (published, unpublished, in press, and in progress). Full details of the Cochrane HIV/AIDS Review Group methods and the journals hand-searched are published in <A HREF="http://www.thecochranelibrary.com/view/0/AboutTheCochraneLibrary.html#CDSR">the section on Collaborative Review Groups in The Cochrane Library</A>
<I>. </I>We used the RCT search strategy developed by The Cochrane Collaboration and detailed in the Cochrane Reviewers' Handbook in combination with terms specific to mother-to-child transmission. We searched the following electronic databases:</P>
<P>(1) MEDLINE (1966 to date) via PubMed on 17 February 2004 and updated on 31 January 2005 and again on 9 February 2006 using the strategy documented in <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>. The searches conducted in 2005 and 2006 yielded 265 records in total of which we selected 29 for full article retrieval. (The search in 2004 yielded 276 records but no record was kept of the number of full articles retrieved for that search.)<BR/>
</P>
<P>For this update we searched MEDLINE via PubMed on 17 April 2009 using the strategy documented in <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK> for the years 2007 to date.This search yielded 773 records of which we selected 23 records for full article retrieval. We also updated the 2006 search as the previous search had been done up until February 2006. This yielded 285 records of which we selected 8 for full article retrieval. See <LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK> for flow diagram details.<BR/>
</P>
<P>(2) EMBASE (2000 to date) on 5 April 2004 and updated again on 31 January 2005 and 9 February 2006 using the PubMed strategy modified for EMBASE documented in <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>.</P>
<P>The searches conducted in 2005 and 2006 yielded 39 records in total of which we selected 15 for full article retrieval. (The search in 2004 yielded 116 records but no record was kept of the number of full articles retrieved.)</P>
<P>For this 2009 update we searched EMBASE again using the strategy documented in <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK> for the years 2006 to date. This search yielded 116 records of which we selected 7 for full article retrieval. See <LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>.<BR/>
</P>
<P>(3) AIDSearch (1995 to date) on 31 January 2005 and again on 9 February 2006. The database includes coverage of the following conferences:<BR/>- International AIDS conference (1985-2004)<BR/>- Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections (1986-2004)<BR/>- The British HIV Association conference (1997-2003)<BR/>- International Congress on Drug Therapy in HIV infection (1994-2002)</P>
<P>We limited our search to 2004 onwards, which yielded 28 records in total of which we selected eight for full article retrieval. See <LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK> for the full search strategy.</P>
<P>For this 2009 update, we searched NLM Gateway instead of AIDSearch as this database is no longer operational. NLM Gateway covers some relevant AIDS conferences and meetings and we used the strategy outlined in <LINK REF="TBL-05" TYPE="TABLE">Table 5</LINK> but no meeting abstracts were found.</P>
<P>As we needed to identify other means of searching conference abstracts, we searched the AEGIS database (www.aegis.org). A research specialist searched all the abstract records from the following major related conferences: 1st-5th IAS Pathogenesis (2001-2009); 10th-17th IAC (1994-2008); 1st-16th CROI (1994-2009); US National HIV Prevention Conference ('99, '03, '05); 7th-14th BHIVA (2001-2008); and 8th-9th European AIDS Society Conference (2001, 2003),<B> </B>using the search terms:</P>
<P>3TC, ABC, AZT, ZDV, d4T, TDF, FTC, NRTI, NNRTI, nucleoside, nucleotide, protease, DLV, EFV, ETR, NVP, APV, ATV, DRV, IDV, LPV, RTV, NFV, TPV, T-20, MVC, Atripla, lamivudine, abacavir, zidovudine, stavudine, zalcitabine, didanosine, emtricitabine, epzicom, kivexa, trizivir, combivir, truvada, delavirdine, efavirenz, nevirapine, amprenavir, fosamprenavir, atazanavir, darunavir, indinavir, lopinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, tipranavir, enfurvitide, maraviroc, raltegravir, tenofovir, breast, mother, infant, baby, pregnant, pregnancy, perinatal, postnatal, feeding, breastfeeding, vertical, mtct, pmtct.</P>
<P>This yielded 6099 results. Results relevant to animal research, behavioural research, etc. (e.g. simian, feline, monkey, baboon, chimpanzee, rhesus, macaque, msm, condom, behavio/ural, couples, husband, wife, boyfriend, girlfriend, violent, violence, cocaine, heroin, methamphetamine, in vitro, murine, mouse), were then excluded leaving 607 net results. No trials that had not been identified previously were identified through this process.</P>
<P>(4) The Cochrane Library Controlled Trials Register on 7 April 2004 and again on 31 January 2005 and 9 February 2006. The searches conducted in 2005 and 2006 yielded 12 records in total of which we selected four for full article retrieval. (The search in 2004 yielded 61 records but no record was kept of the number of full articles retrieved.) See <LINK REF="TBL-04" TYPE="TABLE">Table 4</LINK> for search strategy.</P>
<P>For the 2009 update we searched CENTRAL of Issue 2 of <I>The Cochrane Library</I> on 11 May 2009 using the same strategy as before in <LINK REF="TBL-04" TYPE="TABLE">Table 4</LINK> and yielded 54 records of which we identified 17 for full article retrieval.</P>
<P>[<LINK REF="TBL-05" TYPE="TABLE">Table 5</LINK> contains the search strategy for NLM Gateway used in the previous update in 2005].</P>
<P>We also checked the reference lists of all the articles retrieved by the search strategy for relevant studies.</P>
<P>One of us (NS) attended the International AIDS Society Conference held in Cape Town, South Africa, from 20 to 22 July 2009 and identified additional trials first presented at the conference. Three trials were identified in this way.</P>
<P>Finally, we contacted research organizations and experts in the field for unpublished and ongoing studies and have included these as studies for future assessment.</P>

<P>The primary outcome is the estimated transmission rate of HIV (the observed proportion) at various specific time-points. Our choice was between analysing the crude proportions or the rates as reported by the authors using different survival analytic methods to estimate transmission rates of HIV (these included Cox regression, Kaplan-Meier, Turnbull and life-tables). Survival analysis methods incorporates all available information including the time until infants are diagnosed with HIV infection, or the time until they are tested and are free from infection, or the time until they are lost-to-follow-up (<LINK REF="REF-Ghent-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ghent 2001</LINK>). We therefore chose, where possible, to analyse the reported estimates of the transmission rates. Where these were not reported, we estimated them directly using the published data.</P>
<P>Several studies reported the efficacy of the intervention compared to the control. Efficacy, at a specific time, is defined as the preventive fraction in the exposed group compared to the reference group (<LINK REF="REF-Ghent-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ghent 2001</LINK>), which is the relative reduction in the proportion infected: 1-(Re/Rf). Here Re is the estimated cumulative rate of transmission in the experimental group and Rf is the estimated cumulative rate of transmission in the reference group. We reported the efficacies of the studies up to the specified time-points. For those studies where efficacy and hence confidence intervals were not reported, we calculated the confidence intervals for the efficacy using the recommended methods (Wilson and Newcombe described in <LINK REF="REF-Altman-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Altman 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>Three trials only compared interventions given to babies (<LINK REF="STD-Taha-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Taha 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Taha-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Taha 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gray-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Gray 2005</LINK>). This means transmission efficacy at birth is not relevant for these trials.</P>
<P>We report the outcomes using the efficacy estimates described above for each trial.

<P>The first trial to assess antiretrovirals for reducing MTCT was <LINK REF="STD-PACTG-076" TYPE="STUDY">PACTG 076</LINK>, which began enrolling participants in April 1991. The trial was conducted in 59 centres in the USA and France and compared 198 mothers receiving a dose of 100 mg of ZDV five times daily from 14 to 34 weeks gestation until onset of labour with 204 mothers receiving a placebo. During labour those mothers randomised to the treatment group received a 2 mg/kg loading dose of ZDV intravenously followed by a dose of 1 mg/kg/hr until delivery and their infants received ZDV syrup at a dose of 2 mg/kg six hourly for six weeks after birth. Infants in the control group received a placebo. This trial was stopped during the first interim analysis in December 1993, as the difference in favour of ZDV was statistically significant.</P>
<P>Since then, the type, dosage and period of drugs to be compared have been modified in each subsequent trial. No two trials in this review compare identical interventions (see <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>
<B> </B>for more detail). In addition, the diagnostic tests used to diagnose HIV infection in both mother and infants differ between trials and over time, as do the criteria for the diagnosis of HIV infection and the time-points at which blood samples were taken (see <LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>). Trials in the breastfeeding populations continue for a longer period than those in non-breastfeeding in order to assess any additional benefit of antiretrovirals in reducing breast-milk transmission.</P>

<P>In order to standardise the reporting of attrition in each trial we calculated a percentage of the number of participants randomised for overall exclusions which included protocol violations after randomisation (even if these were before birth of the baby); termination of treatment (e.g. because of adverse events) and those who were lost-to-follow-up. However, because these figures were variably reported across trials, the attrition rate we report should be treated with caution.</P>
<P>The attrition rate ranged from 0% in the <LINK REF="STD-Bhoopat-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Bhoopat 2005</LINK> trial to 53.4% in the <LINK REF="STD-Thistle-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Thistle 2007</LINK> trial. The latter attrition was reportedly due to a lack of fuel in Zimbabwe at the time of the trial severely hampering the ability of participants to attend follow-up clinics. Eight trials reported attrition greater than 20% and this could be an important source of bias in those trials with smaller sample sizes (see Table of Included Studies). The use of survival analysis in most of these trials would however, reduce the impact of a high attrition rate as it allows for censoring of participants.</P>

<P>We have grouped the trials according to type of comparison e.g. antiretrovirals vs placebo, and within each group stratify according to whether the study was conducted in a breastfeeding population or not. Breastfeeding is defined as greater than 90% of included women breastfeeding their infants at birth. Within strata the results are provided for each trial with the trials ordered chronologically on the date of the start of the trial rather than the date when the report was published.</P>
<P>For the 2009 update, no new trials were identified evaluating antiretrovirals compared with placebo or longer regimens with shorter regimens of the same antiretrovirals. We classified three of the trials identified in the 2009 update as regimens using different antiretrovirals and different durations of treatment. Three trials included evaluations of a regimen of three antiretrovirals given to the mother which we refer to as TRIPLE (also known as Highly Active Antiretroviral Treatment [HAART]) compared with other shorter regimens, and one compared two different TRIPLE regimens with each other.</P>

<BR/>A single dose of NVP given to babies immediately after birth compared to ZDV given to babies for the first 6 weeks after birth did not result in a statistically significant difference in HIV infection rates at 4-8 weeks (Efficacy 35.37%; 95% CI -10.00 to 80.74) and 3 to 4 months (Efficacy 39.69%; 95% CI -1.08 to 80.46).

<LI>There was no significant difference in the overall risk of serious adverse events in infants between ZDV and NVP (118 with ZDV versus 94 with NVP); none were thought to be due to study medication and most were due to infections such as pneumonia (22 with ZDV versus 18 with NVP) and gastroenteritis (20 with ZDV versus 15 with NVP). Other serious events included birth-related conditions (14 with ZDV versus 6 with NVP), physiological jaundice (10 with ZDV versus 5 with NVP) and neonatal septicaemia (7 with ZDV versus 13 with NVP). Of these serious adverse events, 17 (18.1%) in the NVP arm and 36 (30.5%) in the ZDV arm were related to HIV.</LI>

<P>This trial was conducted in Botswana and compared sdNVP with placebo in mothers receiving ZDV from 34 weeks and in labour and infants receiving ZDV twice daily for one month post delivery. Initially the trial aimed to compare sdNVP with placebo in both mothers and infants but this was terminated in August 2002 after the results from the <LINK REF="STD-PHPT_x002d_2" TYPE="STUDY">PHPT-2</LINK> trial showed the superiority of sdNVP in infants. The trial continued to evaluate sdNVP versus placebo in mothers only. Infants in both groups then received sdNVP.</P>
<P>For HIV infection at birth, there were no differences between the groups (Efficacy -64.38%, 95%CI -183.72 to 54.96). At one month post-partum HIV infection rates were not statistically significantly different between the groups (Efficacy -16.22%; 95%CI -102.24 to 69.80). Infant deaths in the first month were not statistically different between groups (RR 0.54, 95%CI 0.22 to 1.35). Stillbirth rates were similar in both groups (RR 1.50, 95%CI 0.43 to 5.28) and there was no difference in the incidence of premature delivery (RR = 1.00, 95%CI 0.40 to 2.50).</P>
<P>In October 2002, TRIPLE became available in Botswana and so all participating women with CD4 &lt; 200 cells/&#956;L or with an AIDS-defining illness were offered TRIPLE and did not receive sdNVP or placebo at onset of labour.</P>
<P>Adverse events:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Mothers: Twenty women experienced life-threatening or serious events between study entry and three months after delivery. Of these, the report states that one event of anaemia was possibly related to sdNVP and two events of rash and abnormal liver function tests were possibly related to sdNVP or placebo as both of these were in the placebo arm.</LI>
<LI>Infants: Twelve stopped ZDV before one month due to toxicity (mainly due to anaemia or neutropaenia); there were five serious or life-threatening events possibly related to sdNVP.

<P>This single-centre Kenyan trial compared TRIPLE (ZDV 300mg twice daily, Lamivudine 150mg twice daily, NVP 200mg twice daily from 34 weeks until 6 months post delivery) with mothers receiving ZDV 300mg twice daily from 34 weeks until labour and sdNVP 200mg at onset of labour. Infants in the TRIPLE group received no additional drugs while those in the ZDV/sdNVP group received sdNVP 2mg/kg within 72 hours of delivery. No babies were infected with HIV at birth in either group; at 6 months post delivery there was no statistically significant difference in HIV infection between groups (Efficacy -84.62%, 95%CI: -490.35 to 321.11). There was no statistically significant difference for the outcome of HIV infection or death at two weeks (Efficacy -84.62%, 95%CI: -490.35 to 321.11), or at 12 months (Efficacy 35.90%; 95%CI: -118.33 to 190.13). There were two stillbirths in the TRIPLE group and one in the ZDV/sdNVP group (RR 1.87, 95%CI 0.18 to 19.47). There were no infant deaths in the TRIPLE arm and one at 2 weeks from sepsis (RR 0.31, 95%CI 0.01 to 7.30).

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2011-05-03 11:16:16 -0700" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This update of the review shows that a combination of antiretroviral drugs is the most effective antiretroviral regimen for decreasing mother-to-child transmission of HIV. It builds on the findings from our previous review that antiretroviral treatment administered in the perinatal period lowers the risk of mother-to-child transmission of HIV. This information is relevant to the care of pregnant women who are HIV-infected in both resource-rich and resource-constrained settings. The choice of which combination of triple antiretrovirals, and the optimal time to initiate antiretrovirals in pregnancy, remains unclear. None of the trials in this review follow-up the infants for longer than 24 months and the long-term adverse effects of in-utero or early neonatal exposure to antiretrovirals is not known. Importantly, data on the emergence and duration of resistance is currently limited.</P>
<P>
<I>Summary of main results from this update</I>
</P>
<P>In this update, the most noteworthy addition to the evidence base is the inclusion of results from trials which compare antiretroviral regimens comprising three drugs either with other regimens (<LINK REF="STD-Kesho-Bora" TYPE="STUDY">Kesho Bora</LINK>;<LINK REF="STD-Chung-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Chung 2008</LINK>) or with another triple antiretroviral combination as in the case of the <LINK REF="STD-Mma-Bana" TYPE="STUDY">Mma Bana</LINK> trial. In the <LINK REF="STD-Kesho-Bora" TYPE="STUDY">Kesho Bora</LINK> trial TRIPLE ART including a protease-based inhibitor was given from 26 to 34 weeks gestation through six months post-partum and compared with a ZDV-based regimen starting later at 28 to 36 weeks with no post-partum component. Infants in the TRIPLE antiretrovirals group were significantly less likely to have the virus at 12 months. The trial population was classified as mixed feeding and the results are likely to indicate the importance of mothers continuing with antiretrovirals should they choose to breastfeed. The <LINK REF="STD-Chung-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Chung 2008</LINK> trial was conducted in a breastfeeding population, with a TRIPLE antiretroviral regimen commenced at 34 weeks compared with only ZDV for the same period until labour when sdNVP was added found no babies were infected with HIV at birth in either group and at 6 months post delivery there was no statistically significant difference in HIV infection between groups. Although the lack of events rates does not allow inferences regarding superiority of the TRIPLE regimen over the ZDV regimen, it does confirm the efficacy of providing antiretrovirals, even if monotherapy ZDV, to mothers earlier in pregnancy. In <LINK REF="STD-Mma-Bana" TYPE="STUDY">Mma Bana</LINK> transmission rates are again gratifyingly low both at birth and later at six months, suggesting that either choice of triple combination antiretroviral is effective. Our results concur with those of the <LINK REF="REF-Sturt-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sturt 2010</LINK> Cochrane review which evaluated the efficacy of treatment for HIV-infected pregnant women and considered transmission as a secondary outcome. Adverse event rates both for mothers and babies were low in all three trials with the exception of a significant difference seen in stillbirths in the <LINK REF="STD-Kesho-Bora" TYPE="STUDY">Kesho Bora</LINK> trial.</P>
<P>The results from the additional four trials identified in this update contributed to the evidence base for the category of antiretroviral regimens using different drugs and durations of treatment. None of the trial results provided significantly different results to those previously documented.</P>
<P>
<I>Summary of main results from previous versions of the review</I>
</P>
<P>ZDV has been the most extensively studied drug and forms a component of treatment in all 25 trials included in this review. In a non-breastfeeding population a long course of ZDV monotherapy used in the antepartum and intrapartum periods and postnatally in babies led to an impressive 66% reduction in HIV infection risk in babies at 18 months (<LINK REF="STD-PACTG-076" TYPE="STUDY">PACTG 076</LINK>). Important benefits were also found with shorter courses of ZDV monotherapy, although these appear to be less pronounced, with effects on HIV infection rates at 4 to 8 weeks ranging from halving to a one third reduction compared with placebo. Among the shorter course regimens, a combination of ZDV and 3TC commenced at 36 weeks and continued through labour and up to a week postpartum and given to babies for the first week after birth appears to be highly worthwhile. Compared with placebo the efficacy of this regimen in reducing HIV infection risk at 4 to 8 weeks was as much as 63% (<LINK REF="STD-PETRA" TYPE="STUDY">PETRA</LINK>).</P>
<P>We found no trials that have evaluated the effects on mother-to-child transmission of NVP monotherapy against placebo. In a breastfeeding population a single dose of nevirapine given to mothers at the onset of labour and to their babies soon after birth compared with a suboptimal course of zidovudine given to mothers only during labour and to their babies for the first week after birth reduced the risk of mother-to-child transmission at 4 to 8 weeks by about 40% with the benefit persisting at 18 months (<LINK REF="STD-HIVNET-012" TYPE="STUDY">HIVNET 012</LINK>). A regimen comparable to <LINK REF="STD-HIVNET-012" TYPE="STUDY">HIVNET 012</LINK> but with mothers receiving an additional dose of NVP postpartum resulted in similar HIV infection rates at 4 to 8 weeks as a regimen consisting of ZDV plus 3TC given to mothers during labour and for one week postpartum and to babies for one week after birth (<LINK REF="STD-PETRA" TYPE="STUDY">PETRA</LINK> regimen B) (<LINK REF="STD-SAINT" TYPE="STUDY">SAINT</LINK>). One small trial comparing the <LINK REF="STD-HIVNET-012" TYPE="STUDY">HIVNET 012</LINK> and Thai CDC regimens failed to demonstrate a significant difference on HIV transmission. (<LINK REF="STD-Kiarie-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Kiarie 2003</LINK>). Furthermore, in a population where mothers were routinely receiving ZDV in the last trimester of pregnancy and their babies were receiving ZDV in the first week after birth, the HIVNET regimen compared with a single dose of NVP given only to mothers did not result in a significant reduction in HIV transmission at 6 months (<LINK REF="STD-PHPT_x002d_2" TYPE="STUDY">PHPT-2</LINK>). The trial did, however, find a reduction in HIV infection and death at 6 months which was marginally significant as well as a significantly lower risk of infant deaths in the first 6 months with the <LINK REF="STD-HIVNET-012" TYPE="STUDY">HIVNET 012</LINK> regimen (<LINK REF="STD-PHPT_x002d_2" TYPE="STUDY">PHPT-2</LINK>) The addition of ZDV treatment to babies in the first week after delivery in addition to the <LINK REF="STD-HIVNET-012" TYPE="STUDY">HIVNET 012</LINK> regimen had no significant effect on HIV transmission compared with an HIVNET regimen alone (<LINK REF="STD-Taha-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Taha 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<B>Length and timing of antiretroviral treatment</B>
</P>
<P>For TRIPLE antiretroviral regimens, there are no trials evaluating provision of antiretrovirals before 26 weeks gestation. However, the World Health Organisation has now suggested that ARV can be started as early as 14 weeks of pregnancy once the period of major teratogenicity is passed (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2009</LINK>) because of the paucity of evidence to suggest any harmful effects after 14 weeks. This evidence of lack of harm, however, is limited to the immediate effect on the fetus and the child up until the end of follow-up, which is often short. The experience with other drugs in pregnancy, particularly diethylstilboestrol is that the toxic effects of in-utero exposure (vaginal cancers in the female offspring and sub-fertility in the male offspring) only became apparent when the offspring were young adults (<LINK REF="REF-Giusti-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Giusti 1995</LINK>). Although this exposure was in the first trimester of pregnancy, there are more recent examples where erythromycin given to women in threatened preterm labour lead to an increase in the risk of cerebral palsy at age 7 (<LINK REF="REF-Kenyon-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kenyon 2008</LINK>) and dexamethasone given to preterm neonates resulted in a excess of cerebral palsy with only limited beneficial effects in the neonatal period ([3]. These examples illustrate that long term effects of drug exposures in pregnancy may not be realised until many years, and perhaps decades, after exposure. These later effects are unlikely to prevent the use of antiretrovirals to prevent mother-to-child transmission, but as more regimens of similar efficacy become available, and as the majority of exposed children will remain free of HIV and survive into adulthood, the relative safety (both short term and long term) of different drugs will be important in guiding treatment choices. The importance of long-term follow-up of these cohorts of exposed children is therefore essential.</P>
<P>With ZDV-based regimens, the length of treatment seems to influence transmission rates with a longer antenatal component being the most beneficial. In placebo-controlled trials ZDV given to mothers from 36 weeks gestation and during labour (<LINK REF="STD-Thai_x002d_CDC" TYPE="STUDY">Thai-CDC</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-RETRO_x002d_CI" TYPE="STUDY">RETRO-CI</LINK>) was more effective than ZDV given from 36 to 38 weeks, through labour and continued for 7 days postpartum (<LINK REF="STD-DITRAME" TYPE="STUDY">DITRAME</LINK>), regardless of whether babies were breast fed. Similarly, in the <LINK REF="STD-PETRA" TYPE="STUDY">PETRA</LINK> study a combination of ZDV and 3TC given to mothers from 36 weeks gestation, during labour and continued for a week postpartum as well as to their babies for a week (regimen A) resulted in a greater reduction in HIV infection rate at 4 to 8 weeks compared with placebo than the same treatment but without an antenatal component (regimen B), a third arm using the combination treatment during labour only (regimen C) was found to be no better than placebo. Furthermore, a direct head-to-head comparison of ZDV given to mothers from 28 weeks gestation and during labour and to babies for 3 days after delivery ('long-short' regimen) resulted in a lower risk of HIV infection or HIV infection or death at 6 months than ZDV given to mothers from 35 weeks and during labour and to infants for 6 weeks after delivery ('short-long' regimen) (<LINK REF="STD-PHPT_x002d_1" TYPE="STUDY">PHPT-1</LINK>). On the other hand, two smaller trials comparing longer and shorter zidovudine regimens found no difference between their effects on HIV infection rates in babies (<LINK REF="STD-Thistle-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Thistle 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bhoopat-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Bhoopat 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>Antiretroviral treatment in the antenatal and intrapartum periods is not an option for HIV infected women who present late for delivery. In these cases, post-exposure prophylaxis limited to babies can be valuable. In one trial, a single dose of NVP immediately after birth plus ZDV for the first 6 weeks after birth compared with a single dose of NVP only reduced infection rates by 37% at 4 to 8 weeks (<LINK REF="STD-Taha-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Taha 2003</LINK>). A further trial compared a single dose of NVP immediately after birth with ZDV given for the first 6 weeks and did not demonstrate a statistically significant difference in the rate of infection (<LINK REF="STD-Gray-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Gray 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<B>Influence of breastfeeding </B>
</P>
<P>Breast milk is a source of HIV and has been shown to increase the risk of mother-to-child transmission of the virus. It is not clear to what extent breastfeeding influences the efficacy of antiretroviral treatment as only a few trials in breastfeeding populations (all of them in Africa) report HIV transmission rates beyond 4 to 8 weeks and the results of these studies are conflicting (<LINK REF="STD-DITRAME" TYPE="STUDY">DITRAME</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-PETRA" TYPE="STUDY">PETRA</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Thistle-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Thistle 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-HIVNET-012" TYPE="STUDY">HIVNET 012</LINK>). In the <LINK REF="STD-DITRAME" TYPE="STUDY">DITRAME</LINK> trial the initial reduction in perinatal transmission was maintained at 18 months; this was also the case in the <LINK REF="STD-HIVNET-012" TYPE="STUDY">HIVNET 012</LINK> trial. On the other hand, in the <LINK REF="STD-PETRA" TYPE="STUDY">PETRA</LINK> study early reductions in HIV infection rates as well as HIV infection or death at 4 to 8 weeks declined and became statistically non-significant by 18 months. One trial did not find a difference in HIV infection rates at any stage of follow up (<LINK REF="STD-Thistle-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Thistle 2004</LINK>)</P>
<P>It should be noted that reliable information on the extent or type of breastfeeding (mixed versus exclusive) across studies was not available to us; neither were we able to take into account other factors influencing transmission risk, such as maternal viral load. A 2005 individual patient data meta-analysis compared the efficacy of various antiretroviral regimens in reducing mother-to-child transmission risk at 6 weeks in African breastfeeding populations using multivariate methods to adjust for maternal CD4 count, breastfeeding and birthweight in (<LINK REF="STD-Leroy-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Leroy 2005</LINK>). The authors concluded that the longest course of ZDV and 3TC (<LINK REF="STD-PETRA" TYPE="STUDY">PETRA</LINK> Regimen A) was more effective than shorter courses of the same drug combination and more effective than any other antiretroviral monotherapy regimen. These results concord with the findings of our review. Of note, is that the <LINK REF="STD-Mma-Bana" TYPE="STUDY">Mma Bana</LINK> trial provided TRIPLE antiretrovirals to breastfeeding mothers and the low transmission rates in both the protease-inhibitor-based and the nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor arms confirm that either TRIPLE antiretroviral combination was effective in maintaining maternal virologic suppression throughout breastfeeding.</P>
<P>
<B>Adverse effects</B>
</P>
<P>None of the trials in our review found statistically significant differences in the rates of serious or life threatening events in either mothers or babies between intervention groups. Mild transient anaemia seems to occur and is most frequently seen in mothers and babies exposed to the long course PACTG076 regimen. No cases of lactic acidosis or hepatic steatosis were found in the trial evaluating d4T and ddI, and nevirapine did not significantly increase the incidence of severe hepatoxicity or rash. Furthermore, antiretrovirals did not increase the likelihood of congenital defects, abnormal growth patterns or the occurrence of childhood cancers, although follow-up was not sufficiently long in most of the trials to assess these later outcomes.</P>
<P>The emergence of resistant mutations following the use of antiretroviral regimens in the prevention of vertical transmission is, however, a cause for concern as this may potentially compromise future treatment of infected mothers and babies including future efforts to reduce mother-to-child transmission (<LINK REF="REF-Eshleman-2005a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eshleman 2005a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Eshleman-2005b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eshleman 2005b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Johnson-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnson 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Eshleman-2005c" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eshleman 2005c</LINK>). A single dose of NVP was associated with an increase in resistant mutations in a subsample of mother-infant pairs in the <LINK REF="STD-HIVNET-012" TYPE="STUDY">HIVNET 012</LINK> trial (<LINK REF="REF-Eshleman-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eshleman 2001</LINK>). It has also been shown that a combination of zidovudine and 3TC does not prevent the emergence of 3TC resistance (<LINK REF="REF-Mandelbrot_x002c_-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mandelbrot, 2001</LINK>). These resistant mutations disappear with time and their clinical importance is therefore by no means clear, yet the finding that viral response to NVP treatment may be reduced in women previously receiving a regimen comprising a single dose NVP plus a short course of ZDV as prophylaxis is worrying (<LINK REF="REF-Jourdain-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jourdain 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>In this update, the completeness of the evidence is again limited by the lack of information pertaining to the emergence and duration of resistance. In a trial of ritonavir-boosted lopinavir compared with NVP-based therapy for treating HIV, 241 HIV-infected mothers who had previously been exposed to single dose NVP six months or more before randomisation, were followed up for two years (<LINK REF="REF-Lockman-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lockman 2010</LINK>). In the group receiving NVP, women with resistance mutations to NVP detectable at treatment initiation had a 73% failure rates compared with 19% of those without resistance mutations. Findings were similar in a trial of 164 HIV-infected children (<LINK REF="REF-Palumbo-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Palumbo 2010</LINK>) . GIven the high costs of antiretrovirals and the fact that in resource-constrained settings many women present late to antenatal care, NVP will continue to play an important role in preventing mother-to-child transmission (<LINK REF="REF-Lallemant-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lallemant 2010</LINK>). This will continue to have implications for clinicians determining which treatment to provide to HIV-infected women and children. Lallemant and Jourdain question whether there is a role for resistance screening to identify individuals who would require non-NVP based treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Lallemant-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lallemant 2010</LINK>) but the costs of this are likely to limit its usefulness.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2011-05-03 11:16:16 -0700" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This 2010 update added evidence from seven new trials to that of the previous 18 trials reported in the update in 2006. None of the new trials compared the same interventions with each other or comprised identical comparisons to those comparisons reported in the previous update.</P>
<P>Four of the new trials contributed data to the comparisons between different antiretroviral regimens of different durations first described in the previous review (<LINK REF="STD-Chi-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Chi 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Thistle-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Thistle 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chung-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Chung 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mashi" TYPE="STUDY">Mashi</LINK>). Three trials evaluated interventions in breast-feeding populations and one in a non-breastfeeding population. None of the new included data changed our previous results or interpretations significantly.</P>
<P>Two new trials contributed data to a new comparison between TRIPLE and other regimens (<LINK REF="STD-Chung-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Chung 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kesho-Bora" TYPE="STUDY">Kesho Bora</LINK>), both conducted in breast-feeding populations. The remaining new trial, <LINK REF="STD-Mma-Bana" TYPE="STUDY">Mma Bana</LINK>, provided data on comparing two types of TRIPLE regimens aimed at treating both the mother and preventing transmission to the infant and was conducted in a mixed-feeding population.</P>
<P>The addition of these seven trials to previous evidence, raised a number of questions including the most effective combination of TRIPLE antiretrovirals and the optimal time to initiate TRIPLE antiretrovirals during pregnancy for both the mother and her baby. Future trials may provide clearer guidance but much of this information is likely to be derived from cohort studies, particularly in the light of the World Health Organization guidelines to commence prevention antiretrovirals at 14 weeks gestation (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>As almost all trials were conducted in African countries in populations of women representative of the general population, the level of applicability of the data from these trials can be viewed as high. However, the decision regarding which combination of antiretrovirals to use will likely be determined by resource availability, setting and costs and it may not always be possible to implement optimal recommendations from guidelines. In such situations results from our previous versions of this review remain pertinent.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2011-03-10 23:32:19 -0800" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>
<I>Heterogeneity of studies</I>
<BR/>Comparison of the results of the trials included in this review is a challenging task given the differences in study populations, trial methodology and treatment regimens. In addition, the methods for assessing HIV transmission varies across studies; both the criteria for establishing HIV infection and the sensitivities of tests have changed over time (<LINK REF="REF-Hill-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hill 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bartlett-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bartlett 2009</LINK>). As a result of these differences, any indirect comparisons between regimens across trials must be treated with considerable caution. To reduce the amount of clinical heterogeneity between trials, we stratified our analysis according to intervention and choice of feeding. Despite this stratification, we were unable to statistically combine the results of the trials using meta-analytic techniques. Given that many of the individual trials were small to moderate in size and that meta-analysis was not possible we cannot rule out the play of chance as an explanation of the findings reported, neither can we rule out the possibility that important but infrequent adverse effects were missed. However, the increasing consistency in reduction of transmission rates using combined antiretrovirals over time provides good evidence in our opinion, to provide triple combination antiretrovirals to all HIV-infected pregnant mothers.</P>
<P>
<I>Determination of infection status</I>
<BR/>Determining exactly when transmission occurs is complex given that the age of infection is known only to be between the ages at the last negative and first positive tests (<LINK REF="REF-Ghent-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ghent 2001</LINK>). The risk of paediatric infection over time also depends on whether or not a mother continues to breastfeed, but few trials collect and provide accurate information on the exact age of complete weaning (<LINK REF="REF-Ghent-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ghent 2001</LINK>). In some trials, it has been noted that infants may become infected well after the reported time of weaning (<LINK REF="REF-Ghent-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ghent 2001</LINK>). The Ghent Working Group, comprising methodologists and trialists, has developed a consensus approach to the statistical analysis applicable across all MTCT trials to facilitate reviewing and meta-analysing such trial data. They stress the importance of good quality information about age at weaning to estimate transmission probabilities in breastfeeding populations in future trials. They also provide a framework for statistical analysis using interval-censored data similar to what we employed in this review. It is important to note that interval-censored data analysis as recommended by the Ghent group does not estimate the 'time to infection' but 'time to detection' of HIV, which is always dependent on the testing schedule. Although we made this observation in our previous update, none of the included trials used the recommended standardised testing schedules which would allow for better comparisons to be made between trials.</P>
<P>
<I>Multiple births</I>
<BR/>Because inclusion of all children from multiple births in an analysis violates the requirement of most statistical methods that observations be independent of one another (<LINK REF="REF-Ghent-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ghent 2001</LINK>), trials have to account for this and we described the different methods each trial used to do this in our review (see Table of Included Studies). However, the Ghent group recommend that all future trials use the first born baby of each multiple birth in studies of MTCT transmission. As observational studies have shown that the first born of twins has a higher risk of infection (<LINK REF="REF-Ghent-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ghent 2001</LINK>), using this method of analysis would provide a more conservative estimate of efficacy but would ensure consistency between study comparison groups and between trials.</P>
<P>
<I>Short-term and long-term efficacy</I>
<BR/>HIV infection in specimens collected between the first day of the neonatal period and day 60 can be used to effectively assess short-term efficacy (<LINK REF="REF-Alioum-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alioum 2003</LINK>). Long-term efficacy estimates of HIV infection are more problematic. Estimates may be biased if only one test is conducted between 15 and 24 months of age because loss to follow-up and deaths are unlikely to be evenly distributed between trial arms (<LINK REF="REF-Alioum-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alioum 2003</LINK>). It has therefore been suggested that HIV-free survival provides a less biased estimate of long-term efficacy (<LINK REF="REF-Ghent-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ghent 2001</LINK>). The difficulties of providing such long-term follow-up beyond trial termination may not always be feasible where public health resources are limited and such ideal information may rarely be available.</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2011-05-02 12:10:11 -0700" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>As recommended for all Cochrane reviews we conducted an extensive and comprehensive search of multiple electronic bibliographic databases and searched conference abstracts and conducted hand-searching of relevant medical journals to identify eligible trials for inclusion. Where possible, we also engaged directly with trialists to obtain missing data or for clarification where this was required. Completed but as yet unpublished trial data, such as that of the trial reported in <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_ONGOING_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of ongoing studies</LINK> will be included in the following update of this review. Our ongoing interaction with investigators of trials and our regular communication with global policymakers at WHO, ensured we were aware of all trial activity in this field. Furthermore, given the high profile nature of the intervention, it is unlikely that our search strategy failed to detect existing current trial evidence.</P>
<P>Potential bias in the conduct of our review was also minimised by having two independent researchers extracting data and assessing the methodological quality of each study. This detailed process allows for a thorough assessment of trial conduct and an exploration of the possible biases that may be present in each trial. In this update we re-evaluated the possible risk of bias in four domains for not only the new trials, but also for all of the previously included 18 trials, ensuring that newer methods were incorporated into the overall assessment. For many of the trials reported in earlier years, quality of reporting of these domains is poor and, as such, we were compelled to judge many of the risks as unclear. Empirical evidence has found that poor quality of reporting is not always associated with actual poor conduct and our judgments must be viewed in this light.</P>
<P>The review is of aggregate trial data. Published aggregate data from trials can be variable in the completeness of outcome reporting and in definitions of both the intervention and outcomes used between trials. This is particularly relevant where survival analysis has been used for outcome reporting and individuals have been censored at different endpoints during a trial, as occurred in many of the included trials. Ideally we would have obtained the individual patient data (IPD) from each trial allowing us to calculate efficacy measures using identical methods across each trial. Differences in analytical methodology does and can make a difference. For instance our results for transmission rates from those trials included in both this review and the <LINK REF="REF-Sturt-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sturt 2010</LINK> Cochrane review differ slightly. This is because the <LINK REF="REF-Sturt-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sturt 2010</LINK> review calculated relative risks from the presented data rather than incorporating the reported survival curves into the analysis as was done in our review. While the latter is arguably desirable given that the time-to-event data is accounted for, the differences in methods to calculate the curves across trials means that greater variation may have been introduced into the final calculations. Obtaining IPD would eliminate this potential source of bias.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2011-04-04 16:57:30 -0700" MODIFIED_BY="Tara Horvath">
<P>Ideally, HIV-infected pregnant women should be provided with a combination of antiretroviral drugs to prevent PMTCT. A regimen combining TRIPLE antiretrovirals is most effective in the long term.</P>
<P>In countries where TRIPLE antiretroviral drug regimens are not yet routinely available, shorter, less expensive antiretroviral regimens for reducing mother-to-child transmission should be considered, as there is good evidence that the benefits associated with such an intervention outweigh the potential risks. It is not yet clear which regimen is best but a combination of antepartum ZDV, and intrapartum and postpartum ZDV and 3TC given to mothers and to babies for one week after delivery or a regimen involving a single dose of NVP given to mothers in labour and babies immediately after birth seems to be effective and feasible. Zidovudine monotherapy is also useful, especially if it includes a long antenatal treatment component. Where HIV-infected women present late for delivery post-exposure prophylaxis for the infant with a single dose of NVP immediately after birth plus ZDV for the first 6 weeks after birth is beneficial.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2011-03-13 01:14:58 -0800" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Research on the long term impact of drug resistance on future treatment of infected mothers and babies is urgently needed; regimens that reduce the likelihood of resistant mutations emerging should be developed and evaluated. </P>
<P>Follow-up of cohorts of infants into adulthood is required to establish the long term safety of provision of antiretrovirals during pregnancy and lactation.</P>
<P>The relative effect and harms of perinatal antiretroviral regimens in babies who are breast fed versus those who are formula fed will continue to require further study. This research should focus on all the outcomes of breastfeeding versus formula feeding in women taking antiretrovirals and include the impact of bottle feeding on mortality and morbidity from other infectious diseases in less-resourced settings.</P>
<P>Future trials should as far as possible use standardised methods that will allow reliable comparisons of treatment effects in different trials and include adequate follow up to fully assess long term safety of antiretrovirals.</P>

<P>This 2x2 factorial compared both peripartum and postpartum strategies for preventing MTCT. For the peripartum intervention, pregnant women from one city, one town and two villages in Botswana were enrolled between 20 June 2002 and 29 October 2003. We report the results of the peripartum antiretroviral intervention in the review.</P>
<P>Prior to the commencement of the above trial, the trial had aimed to assess the superiority of single-dose NVP given to both mothers and infants over placebo when added to the maternal and infant ZDV prophylaxis regimen. However, after 12 August 2002, the results of the <LINK REF="STD-PHPT_x002d_2" TYPE="STUDY">PHPT-2</LINK> trial showing the efficacy of NVP for infants, resulted in the trial of NVP versus placebo being terminated after 17 months of enrolment. The comparison was changed to compare only maternal NVP with placebo with all infants receiving sdNVP. Women enrolled between 20 June 2002 and 12 August 2002 were re-consented to the new design.</P>

Other than HIV, no active serious infection, such as tuberculosis or other potentially serious illnesses. No previous use of antiretrovirals including the <LINK REF="STD-HIVNET-012" TYPE="STUDY">HIVNET 012</LINK> regimen. Mother&#8217;s CD4 count &gt; 200 cells/&#956;L determined in the antenatal clinic. Mother&#8217;s ALT &lt; 2.5 x ULN determined in the antenatal clinic. SECONDARY ELIGIBILTY CRITERIA: Mother who delivers outside of the institution at which the study is based must present with her infant to the study site within 36 hours of delivery. Mother accepts nevirapine and ZDV+3TC 7-day regimen for herself and her infant. Infant birthweight &gt; 2000 g. No severe congenital malformations or other condition(s) not compatible with life. Based on clinical assessment, no maternal condition which would preclude start of study intervention.<BR/>
</P>
</CHAR_PARTICIPANTS>
<CHAR_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>The study will evaluate the following: 1) The efficacy of a high-density caloric/micronutrient nutritional supplement given to HIV-infected women who breastfeed in preventing maternal depletion (weight loss and micronutrient status). 2) The safety and efficacy of maternal or infant antiretroviral regimens, taken for up to 6 months during breastfeeding, in reducing infant HIV infection rates at 48 weeks. 3) The feasibility of exclusive breastfeeding for 6 months followed by rapid weaning. Additional study objectives are to evaluate the feasibility of delivering these interventions in resource poor settings and to identify maternal, infant, and virologic factors associated with HIV transmission during breastfeeding. Drug: Maternal Zidovudine/Lamivudine/Lopinavir-Ritonavir; Drug: Infant nevirapine;  Drug: Maternal protein and calorie supplement.<BR/>
</P>
</CHAR_INTERVENTIONS>
<CHAR_OUTCOMES>
<P>PRIMARY OUTCOMES: 1. Postpartum weight loss between delivery and 28 weeks.; 2. Infant HIV status at 28 weeks. (Infants found to have HIV at birth or 2 weeks after delivery will have been disenrolled.); 3. Exclusive breastfeeding and breastfeeding cessation by 28 weeks.<BR/>
</P>
</CHAR_OUTCOMES>
<CHAR_STARTING_DATE>
<P>Study start: March 2004;  Expected completion: March 2010. Last follow-up: September 2009;  Data entry closure: December 2009. In July 2006, 847 mother-infant pairs have been assigned treatment out of a planned 2,418 (35%)<BR/>
