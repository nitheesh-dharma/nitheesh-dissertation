<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>Cervical cancer is the second most common cancer among women. A woman's risk of developing cervical cancer by 65 years of age ranges from 0.69% in developed countries to 1.38% in developing countries. In Europe, about 60% of women with cervical cancer are alive five years after diagnosis. Standard treatment for selected early cervical cancer is radical hysterectomy, involving removal of the cervix, uterus (womb) and supporting tissues (parametrium), together with the pelvic lymph glands (nodes) and a top part of the vagina (cuff). Traditionally, radical hysterectomy has been performed as open surgery for more than a century. In recent years this operation has also been performed laparoscopically (key hole surgery) to reduce the size of the abdominal incision.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>We carried out a systematic review and searched for published and unpublished randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared open and laparoscopically assisted vaginal methods of performing radical hysterectomy in women with early cervical cancer. The evidence is current to July 2013.</P>
<P>We found only one relevant trial. It included only 13 women; seven had a laparoscopically assisted radical vaginal hysterectomy (LARVH) and six had radical abdominal hysterectomy (RAH).</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>Women who underwent LARVH appeared to have less blood loss, shorter hospital stay and less requirement for pain medication compared with those who underwent RAH. There was no statistically significant difference in the risk of complications related to the operation in women who underwent LARVH and RAH. However, RAH had a significantly shorter operation time compared with LARVH.</P>
<P>The trial did not assess overall survival and progression-free survival (PFS; the time that a woman lives with the cancer but does not get worse) or quality of life (QoL) as the main focus of the trial was to examine short-term complications.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
</P>
<P>Due to the small number of cases and the short-term scope of the trial, we were unable to reach any definite conclusions about the relative benefits and harms of the two forms of treatment and we were unable to identify subgroups of women who are likely to benefit from one treatment or the other.<BR/>

<P>Cervical cancer is the second most common cancer among women and is the most frequent cause of death from gynaecological cancers worldwide. Standard surgical management for selected early-stage cervical cancer is radical hysterectomy. Traditionally, radical hysterectomy has been carried out via the abdominal route and this remains the gold standard surgical management of early cervical cancer. In recent years, advances in minimal access surgery have made it possible to perform radical hysterectomy with the use of laparoscopy with the aim of reducing the surgical morbidity and promoting a faster recovery.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-09-10 14:42:27 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We found one RCT, which included 13 women, that met our inclusion criteria and this trial reported data on LARVH versus RAH.</P>
<P>Women who underwent LARVH for treatment of early-stage cervical cancer appeared to have less blood loss compared with those who underwent RAH. The trial reported a borderline significant difference between the two types of surgery (median blood loss 400 mL (interquartile range (IQR): 325 to 1050) and 1000 mL (IQR: 800 to 1025) for LARVH and RAH, respectively, P value = 0.05). RAH was associated with significantly shorter operation time compared with LARVH (median: 180 minutes with LARVH versus 138 minutes with RAH, P value = 0.05).</P>
<P>There was no statistically significant difference in the risk of perioperative complications in women who underwent LARVH and RAH. The trial reported two (29%) and four (57%) cases of intraoperative and postoperative complications, respectively, in the LARVH group and no (0%) reported cases of intraoperative complications and five (83%) cases of postoperative complications in the RAH group. There were no reported cases of severe perioperative complications.</P>
<P>Bladder and bowel dysfunction of either a transient or chronic nature remain major morbidities after radical hysterectomy, and the one included study showed that there may be significantly less after LARVH.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2013-09-10 11:13:46 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The included trial lacked statistical power due to the small number of women in each group and the low number of observed events. Therefore, the absence of reliable evidence, regarding the effectiveness and safety of the two surgical techniques for the management of early-stage cervical cancer, precludes any definitive guidance or recommendations for clinical practice. The trial did not report data on long-term outcomes, but was at moderate risk of bias due to very low numbers of included women.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2013-09-10 11:13:46 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2013-09-10 11:13:46 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Cervical cancer is the second most common cancer among women up to 65 years of age and is the most frequent cause of death from gynaecological cancers worldwide. A woman's risk of developing cervical cancer by 65 years of age ranges from 0.69% in developed countries to 1.38% in developing countries (<LINK REF="REF-GLOBOCAN-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">GLOBOCAN 2008</LINK>). In Europe, about 60% of women with cervical cancer are alive five years after diagnosis (<LINK REF="REF-EUROCARE-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">EUROCARE 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>Early-stage cervical cancer includes a broad range of disease, from clinically undetectable or microinvasive tumours to large bulky lesions replacing the entire cervix. The International Federation of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) system divides Stage 1 tumours into four categories: 1A1 (microinvasive tumour, less than 3 mm depth), 1A2 (microinvasive tumour, less than 5 mm depth and no wider than 7 mm), 1B1 (clinical lesions no greater than 4 cm or preclinical lesions greater than Stage 1A) and 1B2 (clinical lesions greater than 4 cm) (<LINK REF="REF-Pecorelli-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pecorelli 2009</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2013-09-10 11:13:46 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Women with Stage 1A tumours may be treated with a loop cone or simple hysterectomy (although some centres will perform radical surgery on Stage 1A2 disease), while women with Stage 1B disease traditionally require a so-called radical abdominal hysterectomy (RAH) and pelvic lymph node dissection due to the increased risk of extension beyond the primary lesion, which is greater than 5%.</P>
<P>RAH involves removal of the cervix, uterus (womb) and supporting tissues (parametrium), together with the pelvic lymph nodes and a cuff of vagina. The ovaries may also be removed depending on the age and wishes of the woman. The operation is traditionally performed via an open or abdominal approach, utilising either a midline subumbilical or a transverse suprapubic incision. It is a highly successful operation in terms of oncological outcome, resulting in cure rates in excess of 90% for node negative disease (<LINK REF="REF-Comerci-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Comerci 1998</LINK>). However, it carries significant morbidity, particularly in terms of large volume blood loss, bladder and bowel dysfunction because the surgery is in close proximity to the major organs and vessels within the pelvis (<LINK REF="REF-Di-Saia-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Di Saia 2002</LINK>). Around 20% of women will experience long-term postoperative pelvic floor symptoms that interfere with their lives (<LINK REF="REF-Bergmark-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bergmark 2002</LINK>), and, as the disease affects mainly younger women, potential solutions for reducing these side effects and improving quality of life (QoL) are of particular importance.</P>
<P>Minimal access surgery (keyhole surgery) has largely replaced the open approach for many common surgical procedures, such as removal of the appendix and gall bladder. The consequent reduction in trauma to the abdominal wall and pelvic organs confers a number of potential advantages, including a shorter hospital stay, faster recovery time and more rapid return to normal function (<LINK REF="REF-Cuschieri-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cuschieri 1999</LINK>). Thus, it is an attractive prospect for surgeons seeking to reduce the morbidity of open RAH. As the trend towards minimal access surgery increases, it is essential that these techniques be evaluated further in order to confirm that the new technique reduces risks without jeopardising the likelihood of cure. A systematic review examining all the relevant outcomes is needed in order to enable women to make informed choices about their preferred route of surgery.</P>
<P>The main area of concern with laparoscopically assisted radical vaginal hysterectomy (LARVH) is the suggestion that the radicality of the vaginal part of the procedure (i.e. the extent of the dissection and amount of tissue removed) is, at best, variable, and probably reduced, even in the hands of an experienced surgeon (<LINK REF="REF-Hagen-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hagen 2000</LINK>), although there are few objective data to support this. As a consequence, there are concerns that survival may be compromised. In addition, there is little doubt that technical factors, such as nulliparity, poor vaginal access and the bony structure of the pelvis, may contribute to problems with the vaginal access (<LINK REF="REF-Eltabbakh-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eltabbakh 2000</LINK>), and specific complications, such as lower urinary tract injury, may ensue. Injury to the bowel or great vessels while siting the surgical instruments is also a risk and conversion from the laparoscopic to an open approach may be required due to such difficulties during the operation.</P>
<P>Laparoscopic hysterectomy is performed using a viewing instrument (laparoscope) and other surgical instruments inserted through a number of small abdominal incisions. Once the cervix, uterus and surrounding tissues are detached, they are removed from the body through the vagina. There are three laparoscopic procedures comparable to open RAH (<LINK REF="REF-Canis-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Canis 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Childers-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Childers 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Spirtos-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spirtos 1996</LINK>). Laparoscopic vaginal radical hysterectomy was the first technique to be reported (<LINK REF="REF-Dargent-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dargent 1987</LINK>). With this technique, the pelvic node dissection is performed laparoscopically followed by the radical dissection and excision of the uterus, which is performed through a small vaginal incision, rather than an abdominal incision. </P>
<P>The second technique, combined or LARVH (<LINK REF="REF-Dargent-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dargent 2003</LINK>), and its adaptations (<LINK REF="REF-Kadar-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kadar 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Querleu-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Querleu 1993</LINK>), involves dissecting the tissues through a combination of laparoscopic and vaginal surgery, followed by a laparoscopic node dissection. The third technique, total laparoscopic radical hysterectomy (TLRH), involves a total laparoscopic procedure whereby all the surgery is performed laparoscopically before the tissues are removed through the vagina (<LINK REF="REF-Canis-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Canis 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Spirtos-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spirtos 1996</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2013-09-10 11:13:46 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Studies comparing laparoscopic versus open surgery for early-stage cervical cancer are only available after 1991, when the technique was first applied in its current form. We considered that it was important to conduct this review as, to our knowledge, there have been no systematic reviews comparing the two surgical techniques. It is also important to review the current evidence to be able to make recommendations for the design of future randomised trials in this subject.</P>

<P>We included one single-centre trial, which recruited women with early-stage 1B cervical cancer requiring radical surgical treatment over a 20-month period (<LINK REF="STD-Naik-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Naik 2010</LINK>). The trial randomised 15 women, of whom 13 were assessed at the end of the trial.</P>
<P>The objective of the trial was to compare short-term surgical data, such as blood loss and perioperative complications, in women with early-stage 1B cervical cancer randomised to either LARVH or RAH. All women had histologically confirmed carcinoma of the cervix, FIGO Stage 1B1, less than 2 cm in size, requiring radical hysterectomy and potentially suitable for surgery via a laparoscopic vaginal route. Unusual high-risk histological subtypes (e.g. glassy cell, clear cell, etc. were excluded), pregnant women and those with concomitant or previous malignancy likely to interfere with treatment or comparison were excluded. Adenocarcinoma and adenosquamous histology were included. Participants completed a visual analogue scale to measure their level of pain and were evaluated at two to four weeks to assess scarring, wound healing and adverse effects. Participants returned every three months for one year for pelvic examination and cytology to assess recurrence, but recurrence was not one of the study outcomes. Follow-up colposcopy and biopsy were used at the discretion of the treating physician.</P>
<P>At enrolment, age, body mass index (BMI), parity, smoking status, whether diagnostic large loop excision of the transformation zone (LLETZ) was performed, histology, whether there was lympho-vascular space involvement, lateral tumour size and depth of invasion were recorded. Eight of the 15 women were randomised to LARVH and seven women to RAH. Median age for the LARVH group was 38.5 years (interquartile range (IQR): 33.5 to 53.5) and 37 years for the RAH group (IQR: 29.5 to 46). Mean BMI was 24.8 (standard deviation (SD) 1.3) and 25 (SD 1.8) in the LARVH and RAH groups, respectively. Median parity was two in both groups (IQR: 1 to 3 and 1 to 2 in the LARVH and RAH groups, respectively). Twelve (92%) women had diagnostic LLETZ and two (15%) had lympho-vascular space involvement. There were more non-smokers than smokers in the trial (8 (62%) smokers versus 5 (38%) non-smokers) and the tumour histological type was adenocarcinoma in two (15%) women and squamous cell carcinoma in 11 (85%) women. The mean lateral tumour size in the LARVH group was 1.2 cm (SD 0.3 cm) and 1.4 cm in the RAH group (SD 0.2 cm). The mean depth of invasion was 5.6 mm (SD 1.2 mm) and 5.8 mm (SD 1.1 mm) in the LARVH and RAH groups, respectively. There was no statistically significant difference between the two groups with respect to any of the reported baseline characteristics.</P>
<P>All women received intraoperative broad-spectrum antibiotics for the duration of their surgery. Deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis was via perioperative subcutaneous low-molecular-weight heparin and intraoperative pneumatic calf compression devices. All women received morphine (1 mg/mL) via a patient-controlled analgesia system for the first 24 hours postoperatively and oral analgesia thereafter.</P>
<P>The outcomes reported were: need for urinary catheterisation (continuous or intermittent) in days; operating time in minutes (measured from the time of skin incision to the closure of the skin or vagina); estimated blood loss (measured as the sum of suctioned fluids and weighed sponges and drapes at completion of surgery); duration of hospital stay; opiate pain relief requirements in first 36 hours after surgery; intraoperative complications (defined as cardiopulmonary events, cystotomy, enterotomy, ureteric injury and injury of a great vessel or nerve); nodal yield; resection size and postoperative complications (defined as cardiac events (cardiac failure, cardiac arrest), deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, haematoma (radiologically confirmed), urinary tract infection, chest infection and wound infection (microbiologically confirmed)). Additional bladder and bowel function outcomes were also assessed. These were not discussed in the paper but were obtained by correspondence from the trialists. All women completed a Bowel and Urinary Symptoms Questionnaire (BBUSQ-22) two weeks post operatively. The questionnaire comprised of a self completed 22-item inventory, separating into four domains covering constipation, evacuation, incontinence and urinary symptoms. Each domain was scored separately according to a scoring algorithm but did not assess QoL. All participants completed the BBUSQ-22 questionnaire, including the one RAH participant who declined postoperative urodynamic tests. The 'Urinary symptoms' domain is scored out of 100 and scores of greater than 20% are considered clinically abnormal by the questionnaire&#8217;s authors.

<P>The one included trial was at moderate risk of bias as it satisfied four criteria used to assess risk of bias (see <LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>) (<LINK REF="STD-Naik-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Naik 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>The trial reported the method of generation of the sequence of random numbers used to allocate women to treatment arms and made an effort to conceal this allocation sequence from participants and healthcare professionals involved in the trial. However, it was not reported whether the outcome assessors were blinded to all outcomes but they were blinded to the randomisation allocation of the participants who completed the BBUSQ-22. Loss to follow-up was deemed satisfactory, as 87% of women randomised were analysed at endpoint. It seemed unlikely that outcomes had been selectively reported as we obtained results from additional outcomes from correspondence with the trialists (some longer-term outcomes were being prepared to be reported in a second paper, which may be published in the future), but it was unclear if any other bias may have been present. If the surgeons were the ones making the assessment, they were unblinded (clearly) and there may be moderate to high risk of bias, since it would be the surgeons who decided when women were fit for discharge, when a trial without catheter (TWOC) could be performed, etc.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-09-10 11:13:46 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We found only one RCT, which included only 13 women, that met our inclusion criteria and this trial reported data on LARVH versus RAH. However, our primary outcomes were not reported and most of the secondary outcomes were incompletely documented because the trial focused on short-term outcomes or longer-term outcomes, such as bladder and bowel function, with relatively short follow-up.</P>
<P>There was no statistically significant difference in the risk of intra- and postoperative complications between women who received LARVH and those who received RAH, although women appeared to have lost more blood if they underwent RAH (median 400 mL (IQR 325 to 1050) and 1000 mL (IQR 800 to 1025) for LARVH and RAH, respectively (P value = 0.05). There is no evidence as to whether LARVH or RAH is the more effective and safe surgical method for the treatment of early-stage cervical cancer.</P>
<P>We did not expect to identify a large number of RCTs, but the review was restricted to high-quality evidence as various retrospective case series are of inadequate quality and in many instances do not allow for comparison. The main limitation of this review was the fact that the one included trial had a different scope our outcomes and chose to focus on short-term outcomes. We could not examine the effectiveness of the surgical techniques in terms of OS and PFS and many of the important secondary outcomes that we specified in the review. For dichotomous adverse event outcomes such as perioperative complications, the trial lacked the statistical power to detect any difference in risk that might have been present, due to sparse data.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2013-09-10 11:13:46 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Overall, the quality of the evidence was low (<LINK REF="REF-GRADE-Working-Group" TYPE="REFERENCE">GRADE Working Group</LINK>), as it only included a small number of women with early-stage cervical cancer (n = 13), primary survival outcomes were not reported and secondary outcomes were incompletely reported. We did not identify any prospective randomised trials with long-term follow-up that compared LARVH and RAH so no definitive conclusions can be drawn with respect to an optimal surgical technique for the surgical management of early-stage cervical cancer in women needing radical hysterectomy. However, the trial suggests short-term surgical benefits of LARVH, although the size of data is inadequate to support this. In addition, LARVH may be a less radical procedure than RAH, supporting the need for strict participant selection and to restrict the procedure to small tumours.</P>
<P>The single identified RCT does not address OS or PFS, QoL or examine longer-term adverse events. The absence of such outcome data do not allow for any firm conclusions to be made.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2013-09-10 11:13:46 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The one trial that met the inclusion criteria included a small number of women (n = 13), was at moderate risk of bias, and pertinent long-term outcomes were not reported. All participants received the treatment to which they were allocated with no blinding, and a low level of loss to follow-up was reported. The only obvious risk of bias was from the uncertainty as to whether any additional risk of bias may have been present. The trial was not adequately powered to detect differences in dichotomous adverse events. Therefore, from the included RCT, we cannot reach any definitive conclusions about the benefit or harms of either type of surgery.</P>
<P>No woman experienced a severe perioperative complication, but other important outcomes were incompletely reported and the trial focused on short-term outcomes, so there is a great need for data on long-term outcomes, such as OS and QoL, to ensure higher-quality evidence.</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2013-09-10 11:13:46 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We performed a comprehensive search, including a thorough search of the grey literature, and two review authors independently sifted all references and extracted data. We restricted the included studies to RCTs as they provide the strongest level of evidence available. Hence, we have attempted to reduce bias in the review process.</P>
<P>The greatest threat to the validity of the review is likely to be the possibility of publication bias (i.e. studies that found the treatment to have been ineffective may not have been published). We were unable to assess this possibility as the analyses were restricted to the results of a single trial.</P>
<P>Unfortunately, we were unable to find any trials that reported data on long-term outcomes, but have adequately documented the limitations of reporting only incomplete short-term outcomes or outcomes such as bladder and bowel dysfunction with relatively short follow-up.</P>
<P>One of the review authors was also the first author on the included study and this is a potential source of bias.</P>
</POTENTIAL_BIASES>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2013-09-10 11:13:46 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Although we included only one RCT in our systematic review, other comparative retrospective studies have suggested LARVH as an alternative surgical option to RAH in selected cases with small tumour size (<LINK REF="REF-Jackson-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jackson 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Malur-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Malur 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pahisa-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pahisa 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sharma-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sharma 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>The matched controlled single-centre study compared LARVH and RAH for cervical cancer (<LINK REF="REF-Jackson-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jackson 2004</LINK>). Women undergoing LARVH between 1996 and 2003 were identified and matched for age, FIGO stage, histological subtype and nodal metastases using a control group of women who underwent RAH during the same time period. Fifty-seven women were listed for LARVH and 50 cases were matched successfully using the criteria above. The majority of cases were FIGO stage 1B1. The study found no significant difference between recurrence rates or OS in the two arms after a median follow-up of 52 months for LARVH and 49 months for RAH (94% for LARVH versus 96% for RAH). The duration of surgery was significantly greater for the LARVH procedure than the RAH procedure (median 180 minutes versus 120 minutes). Similarly blood loss (median 350 mL versus 875 mL), hospital stay (median five days versus eight days) and duration of continuous bladder catheterisation (median three days versus seven days) were significantly less for LARVH compared with RAH. There were no statistically significant differences with regards to nodal yield, completeness of surgical margins or perioperative complication rate. There were few major complications in the study and there was no statistically significant difference between the two arms (four (8%) in the LARVH group and three (6%) in the RAH group). Postoperative bladder dysfunction and constipation requiring regular laxatives was less common in the LARVH group compared with the RAH group, but these differences approached borderline significance (3 women versus 12 women had seen a specialist regarding postoperative bladder dysfunction (P value = 0.04) and no women versus six women reported constipation requiring regular laxatives (P value = 0.03) in the LARVH and RAH groups, respectively). This rate appears low for LARVH suggesting QoL may be improved without compromising survival.</P>
<P>Similarly, the <LINK REF="REF-Sharma-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sharma 2006</LINK> single-centre study compared the safety, efficacy and short-term benefits of LARVH (the Coelio-Schauta procedure) with RAH. After excluding ineligible women, 27 women with stage 1B disease who had LARVH and 28 women with stage 1B disease who had RAH were included. The cohorts were similar in age, bodyweight, previous abdominal surgery, histological subtype, FIGO stage, resection margins, node count and node status, length of follow-up and recurrence. There were statistically significant differences between LARVH and RAH for duration of surgery (mean 160 minutes versus 132 minutes), intraoperative blood loss (479 mL versus 715 mL), hospital stay (mean 5 days versus 9.3 days), postoperative complications (6 women versus 20 women) and duration of bladder catheterisation (mean 4.4 days versus 8.8 days). Four women in the LARVH group and no women in the RAH group had urinary tract injury that was repaired. None had long-term sequelae. The data suggested that LARVH is a suitable alternative to RAH for small-volume stage 1B1 cervical cancer with similar clinical efficacy and a superior postoperative recovery and postoperative morbidity profile.</P>
<P>The <LINK REF="REF-Pahisa-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pahisa 2010</LINK> study suggested similar intraoperative complication rates with marginally less blood loss and transfusion rates in 67 LARVH cases with similar long-term bladder and bowel functions. Recurrence rates and mortality were similar in both groups. <LINK REF="REF-Malur-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Malur 2001</LINK> compared short-term outcome in 70 cases of LARVH with 70 cases of RAH. The control group was not matched with the study group. This study also showed less blood loss and transfusion rates with shorter hospital stay in the LARVH group. However, intraoperative complication rates were significantly higher in the LARVH group.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Hertel-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hertel 2003</LINK> analysed 200 LARVH cases and compared the survival rates in different risk groups. Overall, five-year survival was 83%. In the absence of risk factors such as tumour size less than 4 cm, no lympho-vascular space involvement and negative lymph nodes, five-year survival was 98%. Unfortunately, this study did not compare the survival rates with RAH.</P>
<P>More recently, TLRH and robotic-assisted TLRH have been more commonly used surgical methods than LARVH as the radicality of surgery may be more similar to RAH than LARVH. LARVH has been mostly indicated for tumours smaller than 2 cm (<LINK REF="STD-Naik-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Naik 2010</LINK>). As reviewed by <LINK REF="REF-Roy-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roy 2011</LINK>, there are no published studies to date comparing LARVH versus TLRH or robotic-assisted TLRH. To design a trial to compare the two procedures seems to be an unrealistic target now since the popularities of TLRH and robotic-assisted TLRH have been consistently increasing. Robot is an advanced laparoscopic tool and the perioperative and short-term survival outcomes of women treated with robotic-assisted TLRH have been promising (<LINK REF="REF-Cantrell-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cantrell 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Geisler-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Geisler 2010</LINK>). The advantages of the robotic surgery include shorter learning curves, three-dimensional magnification, tremor reduction and motion downscaling with improved ergonomics (<LINK REF="REF-Yim-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yim 2011</LINK>). An international multicentre RCT, Laparoscopic Approach to Cervical Cancer (LACC), has been recruiting participants since 2008 to compare RAH with TLRH or robotic-assisted TLRH. This trial is estimated to be completed in July 2017 (<LINK REF="REF-Obermair-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Obermair 2008</LINK>).</P>

<P>We found only low-quality evidence comparing laparoscopically assisted radical hysterectomy (LARVH) and radical abdominal hysterectomy (RAH) for the treatment of early-stage cervical cancer. The included trial lacked statistical power due to the small number of women in each group and the low number of observed events. The trial objectives focused on short-term outcomes and, therefore, did not report overall and progression-free survival or pertinent long-term adverse events or quality of life (QoL) measures. Therefore, the absence of reliable evidence regarding the effectiveness and safety of the two surgical techniques precludes any definitive conclusions to be made. However, the trial suggests possible short-term surgical benefits of LARVH. LARVH has been shown to be a less radical procedure in the one included trial and a number of retrospective studies, supporting the need for strict participant selection and to restrict the procedure to small tumours.<BR/>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2013-09-10 11:13:46 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>A sufficiently powered randomised controlled trial (RCT) comparing LARVH and RAH for the treatment of early-stage cervical cancer that examines long-term outcomes is required. Non-randomised studies assessing the relative benefits and potential harms of the two forms of surgery have been conducted and further studies would offer relatively little benefit due to the obvious problems regarding selection biases. Even studies that use multivariable analysis to adjust for differences in prognostic factors between the treatment groups are potentially liable to problems of bias. An RCT in this area has been performed on short-term outcomes, so this needs to be extended to important longer-term outcomes such as overall and progression-free survival and QoL and needs to recruit an adequate number of women in multicentre trials. These trials should also consider the inclusion of total laparoscopic radical hysterectomy (TLRH) (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2010</LINK>) and robotic-assisted TLRH arms.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Restriction to RCTs</HEADING>
<P>The search strategy identified one RCT that met our inclusion criteria, so we restricted the review to RCTs as they provide the best level of evidence. We were also concerned about the threat of selection bias in non-randomised studies. In the protocol, we had stated the following:</P>
<P>"As we expect to find few, if any, RCTs of surgical interventions (<LINK REF="REF-Johnson-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnson 2008</LINK>), non-randomised studies with concurrent comparison groups will be included:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Quasi-randomised trials, non-randomised trials, prospective and retrospective cohort studies, and case series of 30 or more patients.</LI>
</UL>
<P>Case-control studies, uncontrolled observational studies and case series of fewer than 30 patients will be excluded.</P>
<P>In order to minimise selection bias, we will include only studies that use statistical adjustment for baseline case mix using multivariable analyses (e.g. age, performance status, grade, etc) if any constraints are placed on treatment allocation (e.g. women with poor performance status would not be given radical abdominal hysterectomy) or it is based on clinician preference."</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Searches</HEADING>
<P>In the protocol, we stated:</P>
<P>"The main investigators of any relevant ongoing trials will be contacted for further information, as will any major co-operative trials groups active in this area."</P>
<P>However, we did not find any relevant ongoing trials or active trials groups, so we did not make these contacts.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Risk of bias</HEADING>
<P>Risk of bias was not examined in non-randomised studies as the review was restricted to RCTs. In the protocol, we stated the following:</P>
<P>"The risk of bias in non-randomised controlled trials will be assessed in accordance with four additional criteria:</P>
<P>
<I>Cohort selection</I>
</P>
<P>1. Were relevant details of criteria for assignment of patients to treatments provided?</P>
<UL>
<LI>Yes</LI>
<LI>No</LI>
<LI>Unclear</LI>
</UL>
<P> 2. Was the group of women who received the experimental intervention (LARVH surgery) representative?</P>
<UL>
<LI>Yes, if they were representative of women with early-stage cervical cancer.</LI>
<LI>No, if group of patients was selected.</LI>
<LI>Unclear, if selection of group was not described.</LI>
</UL>
<P> 3. Was the group of women who received the comparison intervention (RAH surgery) representative?</P>
<UL>
<LI>Yes, if drawn from the same population as the exposed cohort.</LI>
<LI>No, if drawn from a different source.</LI>
<LI>Unclear, if selection of group not described.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<I>Comparability of treatment groups</I>
</P>
<OL>
<LI>Were there no differences between the two groups or were differences controlled for, in particular with reference to age, FIGO stage, histological cell type, differentiation and type of surgeon (Gynaeoncologist, Gynaecologist, General surgeon)?</LI>
</OL>
<UL>
<LI>Yes, if at least three of these characteristics were reported and any reported differences were controlled for.</LI>
<LI>No, if the two groups differed and differences were not controlled for.</LI>
<LI>Unclear, if fewer than three of these characteristics were reported even if there were no other differences between the groups, and other characteristics were controlled for."</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Time-to-event and continuous outcome data</HEADING>
<P>Time-to-event outcome data were not reported in the trial of <LINK REF="STD-Naik-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Naik 2010</LINK> as the trial focused on short-term outcomes and continuous outcomes were reported in terms of median and IQR, so the following sections in the protocol, which discussed the handling of data for survival and continuous outcomes, were removed as they were unnecessary:</P>
<P>
<B>"Data extraction and management</B>
</P>
<P>Data on outcomes will be extracted as below:</P>
<UL>
<LI>For time to event (overall and progression-free or disease-free survival) data, we will extract the log of the hazard ratio [log(HR)] and its standard error from trial reports; if these are not reported, we will attempt to estimate them from other reported statistics using the methods of <LINK REF="REF-Parmar-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parmar 1998</LINK>. </LI>
<LI>For continuous outcomes (e.g. QoL measures), we will extract the final value and standard deviation of the outcome of interest and the number of patients assessed at endpoint in each treatment arm at the end of follow-up, in order to estimate the mean difference (if trials measured outcomes on the same scale) or standardised mean differences (if trials measured outcomes on different scales) between treatment arms and its standard error.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<B>Measures of treatment effect</B>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>For time to event data, we will use the HR, if possible. The HR summarises the chances of survival in women who received one type of treatment compared to the chances of survival in women who received another type of treatment. However, the logarithm of the HR, rather than the HR itself, is generally used in meta-analyses.</LI>
<LI>For continuous outcomes, we will use the mean difference between treatment arms".</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Data synthesis</HEADING>
<P>We only identified one included trial so it was not possible to perform meta-analyses. Therefore, it was not relevant to assess heterogeneity between results of trials and we were unable to assess reporting biases using funnel plots or conduct any subgroup analyses or sensitivity analyses. The following sections of the protocol were, therefore, removed:</P>
<P>
<B>"</B>
<B>Assessment of heterogeneity </B> </P>
<P>Heterogeneity between studies will be assessed by visual inspection of forest plots, by estimation of the percentage heterogeneity between trials which cannot be ascribed to sampling variation (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2003</LINK>), by a formal statistical test of the significance of the heterogeneity (<LINK REF="REF-Deeks-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deeks 2001</LINK>) and, where possible, by subgroup analyses (see below). If there was evidence of substantial heterogeneity, the possible reasons for this were investigated and reported.</P>
<P>
<B>Assessment of reporting biases </B> </P>
<P>Funnel plots corresponding to meta-analysis of the primary outcome will be examined to assess the potential for small study effects such as publication bias. If these plots suggest that treatment effects may not be sampled from a symmetric distribution, as assumed by the random effects model, further meta-analyses will be performed using fixed effects models.</P>
<P>
<B>Data synthesis</B>
</P>
<P>If sufficient, clinically similar studies are available, their results will be pooled in meta-analyses. Adjusted summary statistics will be used if available; otherwise unadjusted results will be used.</P>
<UL>
<LI>For time-to-event data, HRs will be pooled using the generic inverse variance facility of RevMan 5.</LI>
<LI>For any dichotomous outcomes, the RR will be calculated for each study and these will then be pooled. </LI>
<LI>For continuous outcomes, the mean differences between the treatment arms at the end of follow-up will be pooled if all trials measured the outcome on the same scale, otherwise standardised mean differences will be pooled. </LI>
</UL>
<P>Random effects models with inverse variance weighting will be used for all meta-analyses (<LINK REF="REF-DerSimonian-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">DerSimonian 1986</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<B>Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity</B>
</P>
<P>We do not plan to carry out any subgroup analyses.</P>
<P>Factors such as age, stage, grade, performance status, type of surgeon, will be considered in interpretation of any heterogeneity.</P>
<P>
<B>Sensitivity analysis</B>  </P>
<P>Sensitivity analyses will be performed excluding studies at high risk of bias".</P>

<P>
<B>Intervention:</B>
</P>
<P>
<B>LARVH:</B>
</P>
<P>LARVH is performed using a viewing instrument (laparoscope) and other surgical instruments inserted through a number of small abdominal incisions. Laparoscopic lymph node dissection is followed by dissection of the uterus and surrounding tissues. Rest of the operation is carried out vaginally and the specimens are removed from the body through the vagina (<LINK REF="REF-Dargent-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dargent 2000</LINK>)</P>
<P>
<B>Comparison:</B>
</P>
<P>
<B>RAH:</B>
</P>
<P>RAH involves removal of the cervix, uterus (womb) and supporting tissues (parametrium), together with the pelvic lymph nodes and a cuff of vagina. The operation is performed via an open or abdominal approach, utilising either a midline subumbilical or a transverse suprapubic incision (<LINK REF="REF-Lopes-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lopes 1995</LINK>)</P>
<P>All women received intraoperative broad-spectrum antibiotics for the duration of their surgery. Deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis was via perioperative subcutaneous low-molecular-weight heparin and intraoperative pneumatic calf compression garments. All women received morphine (1 mg/mL) via a patient-controlled analgesia system for the first 24 hours postoperatively and oral analgesia thereafter</P>

<P>15 women were recruited to the study over a 20-month period. The trial was stopped at the end of the funding period because extension would not increase the precision of the estimated differences</P>
<P>There were 2 exclusions after randomisation. 1 woman in the LARVH arm declined her allocation, exited the trial and defaulted to standard treatment. 1 woman in the RAH arm had her surgery abandoned before hysterectomy could be performed because a synchronous bowel tumour with multiple liver metastases was discovered intraoperatively</P>
<P>In the group assigned to laparoscopic surgery, there was 1 intraoperative conversion to the open procedure (14%) because of an enterotomy. After examination under anaesthetic, another woman was found to have a cervical defect (because of previous conisation) potentially compromising the vaginal part of the procedure and the decision for open surgery was made</P>
<P>Statistically significant differences (P value &lt; 0.05) were found for the following when LARVH was compared with RAH: the median duration of catheterisation, median operating time, median blood loss, median hospital stay and median opiate requirement in the first 36 hours postoperatively</P>
<P>There were 2 intraoperative complications in the LARVH group - 1 enterotomy requiring conversion to the open procedure and 1 cystotomy, which was repaired vaginally. Neither woman suffered any long-term sequelae</P>
<P>Postoperative complications encountered were minor. 1 woman was readmitted to hospital after 32 days with severe constipation after RAH<BR/>
