<P>We have amended the GRADE assessment for two outcomes, duration of diarrhea and diarrhea on day 7 for children aged less than 6 months with acute diarrhoea and treated with zinc, which we had scored incorrectly in the review update. We had stated that these outcomes had a GRADE score of moderate. However, we had downgraded the certainty of the evidence by 2, and thus the certainty of the evidence was low. We have amended the certainty of the evidence for these two outcomes to low in 'Summary of findings' table 2 and the review text.<BR/>

<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2017-04-24 14:54:16 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In low- and middle-income countries, millions of children suffer from severe diarrhoea every year and many die from dehydration. Giving fluids by mouth (using an oral rehydration solution (ORS)) has been shown to save children's lives, but it has no effect on the length of time the children suffer with diarrhoea. Zinc supplementation could help reduce the duration and the severity of diarrhoea, and therefore have an additional benefit over ORS in reducing children mortality.</P>
<P>
<B>What is oral zinc and how may it shorten the duration and severity of diarrhoea</B>
</P>
<P>Zinc is usually given as zinc sulphate, zinc acetate, or zinc gluconate, which are all water-soluble compounds. The World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) recommend 10 mg to 20 mg of zinc per day for children with diarrhoea. There are several mechanism of action of zinc on acute diarrhoea, some of which are specific to the gastrointestinal system: zinc restores mucosal barrier integrity and enterocyte brush-border enzyme activity, it promotes the production of antibodies and circulating lymphocytes against intestinal pathogens, and has a direct effect on ion channels, acting as a potassium channel blocker of adenosine 3-5-cyclic monophosphate-mediated chlorine secretion. Cochrane researchers examined the evidence available up to 30 September 2016.</P>
<P>
<B>What the evidence in the review suggests</B>
</P>
<P>Thirty-three trials that included 10,841 children met the inclusion criteria of this review.</P>
<P>Among children with acute diarrhoea, we don't know if treating children with zinc has an effect on death or number of children hospitalized (<I>very low certainty evidence</I>). In children older than six months, zinc supplementation may shorten the average duration of diarrhoea by around half a day (<I>low certainty evidence</I>), and probably reduces the number of children whose diarrhoea persists until day seven (<I>moderate certainty evidence</I>). In children with signs of malnutrition the effect appears greater, reducing the duration of diarrhoea by around a day (<I>high certainty evidence</I>). Conversely, in children younger than six months, the available evidence suggests zinc supplementation may have no effect on the mean duration of diarrhoea (<I>low </I>
<I>certainty evidence</I>), or the number of children who still have diarrhoea on day seven (<I>low </I>
<I>certainty evidence</I>). Zinc supplementation increased the risk of vomiting in both age groups (<I>moderate certainty evidence</I>). No other adverse effects were reported.</P>
<P>Among children with persistent diarrhoea, zinc supplementation probably shortens the average duration of diarrhoea by around 16 hours (<I>moderate certainty</I>) but it probably increases the risk of vomiting (<I>moderate certainty evidence</I>).</P>
<P>In areas where the prevalence of zinc deficiency or the prevalence of malnutrition is high, zinc may be of benefit in children aged six months or more. The current evidence does not support the use of zinc supplementation in children less six months of age, in well-nourished children, and in settings where children are at low risk of zinc deficiency.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2016-12-16 15:13:10 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2016-12-14 12:55:48 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Despite improving trends in mortality rates, diarrhoea still causes nearly 10% of all deaths in children under five years of age and accounts for about 500,000 child deaths in developing countries every year (<LINK REF="REF-Liu-2015a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liu 2015a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Liu-2015b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liu 2015b</LINK>). The incidence of diarrhoea decreased from 3.4 episodes per child-year in 1990 to 2.9 episodes per child-year in 2010. However, it still remains one of the most common reasons of hospital admission, with an estimated 1731 million episodes of childhood diarrhoea reported in 2011 of which 2% progressed to severe disease (<LINK REF="REF-Das-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Das 2014</LINK>). Diarrhoea is also an important cause of malnutrition, particularly when it is prolonged (<LINK REF="REF-Brown-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brown 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>Zinc deficiency is mainly due to inadequate dietary intake and is estimated to be common in many countries, especially in children (<LINK REF="REF-IZiNCG-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">IZiNCG 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wagstaff-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wagstaff 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hess-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hess 2009</LINK>). According to recent estimates, 17.3% of the world&#8217;s population is currently at risk of inadequate zinc intake (<LINK REF="REF-Wessells-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wessells 2012</LINK>). The regional estimated prevalence of inadequate zinc intake ranges from 7.5% in high-income regions to 30% in South Asia (<LINK REF="REF-Wessells-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wessells 2012</LINK>). Foods more rich in zinc are 'expensive foods', such as meat and fish (<LINK REF="REF-IZiNCG-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">IZiNCG 2004</LINK>). Zinc is also present in nuts, seeds, legumes, and wholegrain cereal, but the high phytate content of these foods interferes with its absorption (<LINK REF="REF-IZiNCG-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">IZiNCG 2004</LINK>). Zinc cannot be stored in the body, and nearly 50% of zinc excretion takes place through the gastrointestinal tract and is increased during episodes of diarrhoea (<LINK REF="REF-IZiNCG-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">IZiNCG 2004</LINK>). Zinc requirement varies with age and is highest in children due to their rapid rates of growth. As a consequence, young children who are regularly exposed to gastrointestinal pathogens and have diets low in animal products and high in phytate-rich foods are most at risk of zinc deficiency (<LINK REF="REF-IZiNCG-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">IZiNCG 2004</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2016-12-15 14:35:04 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Treatment of diarrhoea with oral rehydration solution (ORS) reduces mortality due to dehydration (<LINK REF="REF-Liu-2015a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liu 2015a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Liu-2015b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liu 2015b</LINK>). In addition to ORS, the World Health Organization (WHO) and United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) recommend for children under five years of age with diarrhoea a supplementation with 10 to 20 mg of zinc per day, at least twice the recommended daily allowance (<LINK REF="REF-WHO_x002f_UNICEF-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO/UNICEF 2004</LINK>). Zinc is usually given as zinc sulphate, zinc acetate, or zinc gluconate, which are all water-soluble compounds (<LINK REF="REF-IZiNCG-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">IZiNCG 2004</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2016-11-24 14:49:34 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There are several different mechanism of action of zinc on acute diarrhoea (<LINK REF="REF-Berni-Canani-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Berni Canani 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Krebs-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Krebs 2014</LINK>). Zinc influences the activity of over 300 enzymes, some of which are responsible for DNA replication and transcription (<LINK REF="REF-IZiNCG-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">IZiNCG 2004</LINK>). Zinc promotes immunity, skin and mucosal resistance to infection, growth, and development of the nervous system (<LINK REF="REF-MacDonald-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">MacDonald 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Prasad-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Prasad 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hess-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hess 2009</LINK>). It is also an important antioxidant and preserves cellular membrane integrity (<LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Dell-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Dell 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Powell-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Powell 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Prasad-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Prasad 2014</LINK>). At the level of gastrointestinal system, zinc restores mucosal barrier integrity and enterocyte brush-border enzyme activity (<LINK REF="STD-Roy-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Roy 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shankar-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Shankar 1998</LINK>), it promotes the production of antibodies and circulating lymphocytes against intestinal pathogens (<LINK REF="REF-Sazawal-1997b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sazawal 1997b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Albert-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Albert 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Raqib-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Raqib 2004</LINK>), and has a direct effect on ion channels, acting as a potassium channel blocker of adenosine 3-5-cyclic monophosphate-mediated chlorine secretion (<LINK REF="REF-Hoque-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hoque 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hoque-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hoque 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>Zinc supplementation may have different effects according to the level of zinc deficiency in the country and in the individual. It is important to verify whether zinc supplementation is effective in countries with high, or even medium or low risk of zinc deficiency (<LINK REF="REF-IZiNCG-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">IZiNCG 2004</LINK>). Despite an accurate estimation of the prevalence of zinc deficiency in populations is hampered by the lack of reliable indicators or biomarkers (<LINK REF="REF-Wieringa-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wieringa 2015</LINK>), indirect indicators such as the prevalence of stunting or anaemia, and the absorbable zinc content of the national food supply are currently used at to estimate the prevalence of zinc deficiency in populations (<LINK REF="REF-IZiNCG-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">IZiNCG 2004</LINK>). Zinc requirements are higher in malnourished children because nutritional zinc deficiency is considered more severe in these children (<LINK REF="REF-IZiNCG-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">IZiNCG 2004</LINK>). However, infants have lower requirements (<LINK REF="REF-IZiNCG-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">IZiNCG 2004</LINK>), as healthy normal birthweight infants have adequate zinc levels at birth from maternal sources even if maternal stores are suboptimal (<LINK REF="REF-Iqbal-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Iqbal 2001</LINK>). Infants may also be able to mobilize hepatic stores accumulated during gestation (<LINK REF="REF-Zlotkin-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zlotkin 1988</LINK>), and are less likely to have had a zinc-depleting illness. Breastfeeding will provide zinc supplementation and protective immune factors against infections (<LINK REF="REF-Krebs-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Krebs 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>Zinc can cause vomiting because of its metallic taste (<LINK REF="REF-Fontaine-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fontaine 2001</LINK>). In high doses, zinc can also cause epigastric pain, lethargy, and fatigue (<LINK REF="REF-IZiNCG-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">IZiNCG 2004</LINK>). One small study suggested a possible increase in mortality in malnourished children supplemented with 6 mg/kg/day of zinc compared to those supplemented with 1.5 mg/kg/day (<LINK REF="STD-Doherty-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Doherty 1998</LINK>). Copper deficiency with zinc supplementation can occur although usually only when zinc is consumed in very high doses (100 to 300 mg/day for adults) over a long period of time (<LINK REF="REF-IZiNCG-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">IZiNCG 2004</LINK>), and malnourished children are at particularly high risk of this due to lower basal copper levels.</P>
<P>Iron and zinc deficiencies often co-exist. These two compounds may compete for the same absorptive pathways, and iron may interfere with zinc utilization (<LINK REF="REF-Gunshin-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gunshin 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kordas-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kordas 2004</LINK>). A review of combined supplementation showed that giving zinc with iron resulted in a lower increase in iron levels compared to giving iron alone; iron supplementation alone had no effect on zinc status (<LINK REF="REF-Fischer-Walker-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fischer Walker 2005</LINK>). A trial that assessed combined supplementation on diarrhoea and malaria morbidity showed that zinc combined with iron reduced zinc's protective effect against diarrhoea (<LINK REF="STD-Richard-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Richard 2006</LINK>). Several trials have also reported a negative interaction of the combined supplementation on physical growth and development (<LINK REF="STD-Rosado-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Rosado 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Dijkhuizen-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dijkhuizen 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zlotkin-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zlotkin 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lind-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Lind 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bhandari-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Bhandari 2007</LINK>). Some protocols suggest supplementing malnourished children also with copper because these children are also prone to copper deficiency (<LINK REF="REF-Beshgetoor-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beshgetoor 1998</LINK>).</P>

<P>We assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach (<LINK REF="REF-GRADEpro-GDT-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">GRADEpro GDT 2014</LINK>). We used GRADEpro Guideline Development Tool (GDT) software to construct the 'Summary of findings' tables (<LINK REF="REF-GRADEpro-GDT-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">GRADEpro GDT 2014</LINK>). The GRADE system considers &#8216;certainty&#8217; to be a judgment of the extent to which we can be confident that the estimates of effect are correct. The level of &#8216;certainty&#8217; is judged on a four-point scale. Evidence from RCTs is initially graded as high and downgraded by either 1, 2, or 3 levels after full consideration of: any limitations in the design of the studies, the directness (or applicability) of the evidence, the consistency and precision of the results, and the possibility of publication bias.</P>
<P>We have displayed the estimates of effect, and the GRADE assessments of our confidence in these estimates in 'Summary of findings tables' for the main comparisons. Where we have downgraded the evidence our reasons for doing so are displayed in footnotes.</P>
<P>When making conclusions about the relative effects of the interventions we used language that reflected the GRADE assessments and our confidence in the estimates, that is if the evidence was of high certainty we said "zinc reduces"; if it was of moderate certainty we stated "zinc probably reduces"; it was of low certainty we used "zinc may reduce"; and where the evidence was of very low certainty we did not draw conclusions.</P>

We also stratified the results by age (children aged less than and greater than six months) because we observed a clear difference in zinc effect according to the age of children enrolled and significant heterogeneity if we pooled all the trials together. We explored the following potential sources of heterogeneity using subgroup analyses: nutritional status (malnourished children versus well-nourished plus moderate malnourished); geographical region (by continent and by high versus medium estimated risk of zinc deficiency as defined by the International Zinc Nutrition Consultative Group (IZiNCG) (<LINK REF="REF-IZiNCG-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">IZiNCG 2004</LINK>)); zinc dose (less than versus greater than 20 mg/day); zinc salt (zinc sulphate versus zinc acetate versus zinc gluconate versus other type); concomitant copper or iron supplementation; and trial setting (hospital versus community trials).

Two trials found no difference in time to resolution of vomiting between zinc and placebo, although we could not pool the results (mean duration 13.63 ± 10.33 hours versus 16.35 ± 11.34 hours, P = 0.1; <LINK REF="STD-Dalgic-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Dalgic 2011</LINK>; median duration 2 days (interquartile range (IQR) 1 to 3) versus 2.5 days (IQR 1 to 5), P &gt; 0.5; <LINK REF="STD-Crisinel-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Crisinel 2015</LINK>).</P>

<P>We constructed funnel plots for trials that reported diarrhoea duration (<LINK REF="FIG-07" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 7</LINK>) and diarrhoea at day 7 (<LINK REF="FIG-08" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 8</LINK>). The funnel plots are both asymmetric due to the absence of smaller trials at the base and, for diarrhoea at day 7, also at the right of the pooled estimate. Asymmetry in the funnel plot could result from possible selection bias where smaller studies reporting greater treatment benefit for the experimental group were published (publication bias). The gap in the bottom corner of the graph suggests that smaller studies without statistically significant effects remain unpublished. However, asymmetry in the funnel plot may also be due to other reasons, such as poor methodological quality in smaller studies leading to spuriously inflated effects in the treatment effect, true heterogeneity, sampling variation or chance (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>).</P>

<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2016-11-24 14:49:34 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This Cochrane Review showed that zinc overall reduced the duration of acute diarrhoea. However, most trials were conducted in populations with moderate to high risk of zinc deficiency (Asia, Africa, children over six months of age and with some degree of malnutrition). Transferability of these results to other countries is therefore likely to depend on local risk of zinc deficiency and other population characteristics such as the degree of malnutrition and breastfeeding habits. The few trials conducted in populations at low risk of zinc deficiency, namely well-nourished children in countries and continents where zinc deficiency is uncommon (Europe, Australia), overall showed no benefit of zinc.</P>
<P>Most trials were conducted in hospital where participants are more likely to adhere to the intervention, but some community trials also showed a benefit with zinc, which suggests that zinc could be used both at hospital and at community level.</P>
<P>The observed increase in vomiting was consistent across trials in all age groups with one large trial reporting that vomiting was limited to one episode in most children and mainly occurring within 10 minutes of administration (<LINK REF="STD-Larson-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Larson 2005</LINK>). Zinc has a metallic after-taste, and development of a more palatable formulation may minimize this adverse effect.</P>

<P>In general, the methodological quality of the trials included in this review was good.</P>
<P>The evidence for benefits on diarrhoea duration in children aged greater than six months of age is of low to moderate certainty. This implies that we can have some confidence in the results but further research may alter the estimates of benefit and harm. The main reasons to downgrade were 'quality of trials' and 'inconsistency' in the results. Heterogeneity between trials was often high. This is perhaps not surprising given the variations in populations, settings, and interventions. We were unable to completely explain this heterogeneity through subgroup analysis, and so our confidence that zinc supplementation can be broadly applied was decreased.</P>
<P>Most trials were conducted in hospitals where death rates were low, and were consequently not powered to detect an effect on mortality. Large community trials are needed to explore whether zinc treatment for diarrhoea reduces hospitalization and death.</P>

<P>We attempted to limit bias by following the rigorous methods provided by the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>).

<P>We made the following modifications to the review.</P>
<UL>
<LI>We changed the inclusion criteria for participant age to "children over one month old" (rather than "two months") to avoid arbitrarily losing trials.</LI>
<LI>We amended death to a secondary outcome measure following feedback from referees.</LI>
<LI>We stratified the results by age categories since we observed significant heterogeneity when trials were pooled, and a clear difference in zinc effect was evident according to age.</LI>
<LI>For subgroup analysis by nutritional status, it was not possible to refer to the definition of malnutrition given in the protocol (weight/height) as most included trials used another definition (weight/age), which is easier to measure. The difference between the two definition is that the first identifies children with acute weight loss or 'wasted', while the second includes both children with acute and chronic malnutrition ('wasted' and 'stunted').</LI>
<LI>Two categories of 'zinc dose' were used (20 mg and &gt; 20 mg) as most trials used zinc 20 mg/day, and only two trials used more than 20 mg/day.</LI>
<LI>We added sex (male, female) as a subgroup as it was identified as a possible effect modifier (<LINK REF="REF-Garenne-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Garenne 2005</LINK>).</LI>
