<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2016-02-15 11:33:09 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>
<B>Review question</B>
</P>
<P>We reviewed the evidence for the effectiveness of interventions for preventing delirium in hospitalised patients, not including those on intensive care units (ICU) (specialised wards for the care of critically ill patients).</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>Delirium is a common and serious illness for people admitted to hospital. It can be distressing for patients and their families. It also increases the chances of developing other complications in hospital, being admitted to a care home or dying in hospital. Delirium is a very expensive condition for health services. Prevention of delirium is therefore desirable for patients, families and health services.</P>
<P>There are many risk factors for developing delirium (e.g. infection, dehydration, certain medications). Therefore, one approach (called &#8216;multi-component interventions&#8217;) to preventing delirium is to target these multiple risk factors. Some medications have effects on the brain chemicals implicated in developing delirium, and may, therefore, have a role in prevention. There are also a number of other interventions that target delirium risk factors related to anaesthesia and medical treatment around the time of surgery.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>This evidence is current to 4 December 2015. We found 39 trials that recruited 16,082 participants testing 22 different multi-component interventions, medications or anaesthetic interventions, compared to usual care, placebo, or different interventions.</P>
<P>
<B>Key findings</B>
</P>
<P>We found strong evidence that multi-component interventions can prevent delirium in both medical and surgical settings and less robust evidence that they reduce the severity of delirium. Evidence about their effect on the duration of delirium is inconclusive.</P>
<P>There is evidence that monitoring the depth of anaesthesia can reduce the occurrence of delirium after general anaesthetic.</P>
<P>We found no clear evidence that a range of medications or other anaesthetic techniques or procedures are effective in preventing delirium.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
</P>
<P>There is moderate-quality evidence to indicate that multi-component interventions reduce the incidence of delirium. The evidence supports implementing multi-component delirium prevention interventions into routine care for patients in hospital.</P>
<P>There is moderate-quality evidence that monitoring depth of general anaesthesia can be used to prevent delirium postoperatively.</P>
<P>The quality of the evidence for a range of medications or other anaesthetic techniques or procedures for preventing delirium is poor (because of the small number of trials and the variable quality of trial methods), and cannot be used to inform changes to practice.</P>
<P>
<B>External funding</B>
</P>
<P>None.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2016-01-23 21:52:01 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Delirium is a common mental disorder, which is distressing and has serious adverse outcomes in hospitalised patients. Prevention of delirium is desirable from the perspective of patients and carers, and healthcare providers. It is currently unclear, however, whether interventions for preventing delirium are effective.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2015-01-17 08:17:51 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>To assess the effectiveness of interventions for preventing delirium in hospitalised non-Intensive Care Unit (ICU) patients.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2016-02-15 10:25:33 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>We searched ALOIS - the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group&#8217;s Specialized Register on 4 December 2015 for all randomised studies on preventing delirium. We also searched MEDLINE (Ovid SP), EMBASE (Ovid SP), PsycINFO (Ovid SP), Central (<I>The Cochrane Library</I>), CINAHL (EBSCOhost), LILACS (BIREME), Web of Science core collection (ISI Web of Science), ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO meta register of trials, ICTRP.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2016-02-12 12:59:49 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of single and multi-
component non-pharmacological and pharmacological interventions for preventing delirium in hospitalised non-ICU patients.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2016-02-15 10:25:43 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>Two review authors examined titles and abstracts of citations identified by the search for eligibility and extracted data independently, with any disagreements settled by consensus. The primary outcome was incidence of delirium; secondary outcomes included duration and severity of delirium, institutional care at discharge, quality of life and healthcare costs. We used risk ratios (RRs) as measures of treatment effect for dichotomous outcomes; and between group mean differences and standard deviations for continuous outcomes.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-02-15 10:26:23 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>We included 39 trials that recruited 16,082 participants, assessing 22 different interventions or comparisons. Fourteen trials were placebo-controlled, 15 evaluated a delirium prevention intervention against usual care, and 10 compared two different interventions. Thirty-two studies were conducted in patients undergoing surgery, the majority in orthopaedic settings. Seven studies were conducted in general medical or geriatric medicine settings.</P>
<P>We found multi-component interventions reduced the incidence of delirium compared to usual care (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.59 to 0.81; seven studies; 1950 participants; moderate-quality evidence). Effect sizes were similar in medical (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.92; four studies; 1365 participants) and surgical settings (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.59 to 0.85; three studies; 585 participants). In the subgroup of patients with pre-existing dementia, the effect of multi-component interventions remains uncertain (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.36; one study, 50 participants; low-quality evidence).</P>
<P>There is no clear evidence that cholinesterase inhibitors are effective in preventing delirium compared to placebo (RR 0.68, 95% CI, 0.17 to 2.62; two studies, 113 participants; very low-quality evidence).</P>
<P>Three trials provide no clear evidence of an effect of antipsychotic medications as a group on the incidence of delirium (RR 0.73, 95% CI, 0.33 to 1.59; 916 participants; very low-quality evidence). In a pre-planned subgroup analysis there was no evidence for effectiveness of a typical antipsychotic (haloperidol) (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.60; two studies; 516 participants, low-quality evidence). However, delirium incidence was lower (RR 0.36, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.52; one study; 400 participants, moderate-quality evidence) for patients treated with an atypical antipsychotic (olanzapine) compared to placebo (moderate-quality evidence).</P>
<P>There is no clear evidence that melatonin or melatonin agonists reduce delirium incidence compared to placebo (RR 0.41, 95% CI 0.09 to 1.89; three studies, 529 participants; low-quality evidence).</P>
<P>There is moderate-quality evidence that Bispectral Index (BIS)-guided anaesthesia reduces the incidence of delirium compared to BIS-blinded anaesthesia or clinical judgement (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.85; two studies; 2057 participants).</P>
<P>It is not possible to generate robust evidence statements for a range of additional pharmacological and anaesthetic interventions due to small numbers of trials, of variable methodological quality.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2016-02-15 11:33:06 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>There is strong evidence supporting multi-component interventions to prevent delirium in hospitalised patients. There is no clear evidence that cholinesterase inhibitors, antipsychotic medication or melatonin reduce the incidence of delirium. Using the Bispectral Index to monitor and control depth of anaesthesia reduces the incidence of postoperative delirium. The role of drugs and other anaesthetic techniques to prevent delirium remains uncertain.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2016-02-15 11:33:13 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2016-02-15 10:28:28 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>Delirium is a disturbance of consciousness and cognition, which usually has a rapid onset and a fluctuating course. It has been variously termed acute organic brain syndrome, acute organic mental disorder and toxic confusional state. Until the 19th century delirium was used to describe a disorder of thinking and later descriptions included disturbances of perception, often with overactive behaviour, or impaired consciousness. The publication of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) III (<LINK REF="REF-APA-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">APA 1987</LINK>) in 1987 brought these ideas together, combining disturbance of consciousness with impairment of cognition. The core features of delirium (disturbance in attention, changes in cognition, and acute onset and fluctuating course) have now been clarified in the International Classification of Diseases version 10 (ICD-10) (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1992</LINK>), DSM-IV (<LINK REF="REF-APA-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">APA 1994</LINK>), and most recently DSM-V (<LINK REF="REF-APA-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">APA 2013</LINK>). This consensus has allowed some standardisation of research, and greater comparability between studies, although differences remain, such as the requirement for evidence of an underlying cause in DSM-IV and DSM-V, but not in ICD-10.</P>
<P>Delirium is common in hospitalised patients. Ten per cent to 30% of admissions to a general hospital develop delirium (<LINK REF="REF-Levkoff-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Levkoff 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Trzepacz-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Trzepacz 1996</LINK>) and in general medical inpatients, occurrence rates ranging from 11% to 42% have been reported (<LINK REF="REF-Siddiqi-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Siddiqi 2006</LINK>). Delirium has a prevalence of up to 60% in frail elderly patients (<LINK REF="REF-Francis-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Francis 1990</LINK>), and 7% to 9.6% in elderly patients presenting to emergency departments (<LINK REF="REF-Elie-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elie 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hustey-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hustey 2003</LINK>). Following coronary artery bypass grafting in the elderly, the incidence has been reported as 33.6% (<LINK REF="REF-Santos-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Santos 2004</LINK>), and after bilateral knee replacements 41% (<LINK REF="REF-Williams_x002d_Russo-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Williams-Russo 1992</LINK>). Following hip fracture, the overall prevalence is 43% to 61% (<LINK REF="REF-Holmes-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Holmes 2000</LINK>). Cancer also increases the risk of developing delirium; 18% of those admitted to an oncology ward, and 26% to 44% of those admitted to hospital or a hospice with a diagnosis of advanced cancer developed delirium (<LINK REF="REF-Centeno-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Centeno 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ljubisavljevic-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ljubisavljevic 2003</LINK>). In patients with AIDS who are unwell enough to be admitted, incidence of delirium is also high, being reported as 46% (<LINK REF="REF-Uldall-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Uldall 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>Delirium is serious, with significant short- and long-term outcomes. Mortality is increased (<LINK REF="REF-McCusker-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">McCusker 2002</LINK>), functional abilities reduced (<LINK REF="REF-Moller-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moller 1998</LINK>), admission to long-term care increased (<LINK REF="REF-Inouye-1998a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Inouye 1998a</LINK>), and length of stay increased (<LINK REF="REF-McCusker-2003a" TYPE="REFERENCE">McCusker 2003a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stevens-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stevens 1998</LINK>). Impairment of cognitive function can persist for at least one year (<LINK REF="REF-McCusker-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">McCusker 2001</LINK>), as can the symptoms of delirium, especially inattention, disorientation and impaired memory (<LINK REF="REF-McCusker-2003b" TYPE="REFERENCE">McCusker 2003b</LINK>). Increasingly recognised is the distress an episode of delirium produces for both sufferers and their carers (<LINK REF="REF-Breitbart-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Breitbart 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>Research in older people has identified a range of risk factors for delirium. The condition clearly has a multi-factorial aetiology, and these risk factors interact (<LINK REF="REF-Inouye-1998b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Inouye 1998b</LINK>); the more risk factors that are present, the greater the likelihood that the patient will develop delirium. Risk factors that have so far been identified include: increased age, sensory deprivation (visual or hearing impairment), sleep deprivation, social isolation, physical restraint, use of bladder catheter, iatrogenic adverse events, poly-pharmacy (more than three new medications added), use of psychoactive drugs, co-morbidities, severe illness (especially infection, fracture or stroke), prior cognitive impairment, temperature abnormality (fever or hypothermia), dehydration, malnutrition and low serum albumin (<LINK REF="REF-Inouye-1998b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Inouye 1998b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Inouye-1999c" TYPE="REFERENCE">Inouye 1999c</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NICE-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>Studies in oncology patients have also identified a range of risk factors for delirium, for example bone metastases, the presence of haematological malignancy, advanced age, cognitive impairment, and low albumin levels (<LINK REF="REF-Ljubisavljevic-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ljubisavljevic 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>The identification of such a varied list of aetiological factors suggests several things. First, we may be able to identify patients at high risk of developing delirium, and by modifying these risk factors could attempt to prevent it; such prevention strategies could be targeted to specific groups of patients.</P>
<P>Second, many of these risk factors can be seen as hospital 'quality of care' measures, e.g. malnutrition, dehydration, use of physical restraints, iatrogenic events. Occurrence of delirium can, therefore, be seen as a proxy measure of the quality of inpatient care (<LINK REF="REF-Inouye-1999b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Inouye 1999b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Inouye-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Inouye 2014</LINK>); and effective interventions to prevent delirium may be considered integral to quality improvement.</P>
<P>Quality improvement is a major issue for healthcare, particularly in services for older people (<LINK REF="REF-Institute-for-Innovation-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Institute for Innovation 2006</LINK>). We know that healthcare systems and services, internationally, have not kept pace with demographic transitions, and often fail to meet the complex needs requiring multidisciplinary care of growing numbers of older people (<LINK REF="REF-Hubbard-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hubbard 2004</LINK>). General hospitals, in fact, frequently have attributes that unintentionally stimulate or aggravate delirium (<LINK REF="REF-Young-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Young 2007</LINK>). However, addressing this is challenging and requires wide-ranging changes to systems of care. Focusing on delirium prevention may help develop the necessary professional skills, cultural aspects, and service design in such a way as to drive up quality of care.</P>
<P>
<BR/>Prevention of delirium is clearly desirable for both patients and carers, and can also reduce health service costs. Healthcare costs in patients who developed delirium in intensive care units (ICUs) were 31% higher ($41,836 versus $27,106) (<LINK REF="REF-Milbrandt-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Milbrandt 2004</LINK>). A non-randomised study of a multi-component intervention for delirium also demonstrated overall improved cost-effectiveness (<LINK REF="REF-Rizzo-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rizzo 2001</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2016-02-15 11:33:13 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>This review assesses the effectiveness of non-pharmacological and pharmacological interventions for preventing delirium in hospitalised patients, excluding the ICU setting.</P>
<P>A range of non-pharmacological interventions for preventing delirium in hospitalised patients have been developed. Most have taken a multi-factorial approach to delirium prevention, attempting to prevent several risk factors by protocols, education or systems redesign, (<LINK REF="STD-Cole-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Cole 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Inouye-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Inouye 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Milisen-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Milisen 2001</LINK>), although some target a single risk factor only. Examples include programmes of education for ward nursing staff (<LINK REF="REF-Rockwood-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rockwood 1999</LINK>), protocols targeting specific risk factors and implemented by a trained interdisciplinary team (<LINK REF="REF-Inouye-1999a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Inouye 1999a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Young-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Young 2015</LINK>), and specialist nursing interventions to educate nursing staff, assess and change medication, encourage mobilisation and improve the environment of the patient (<LINK REF="STD-Wanich-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Wanich 1992</LINK>).</P>
<P>Pharmacological interventions are based on an understanding of the multiple neurotransmitter pathways involved in developing delirium and substances that might potentially modify these or modify other important risk factors. These include, for example, cholinesterase inhibitors, antipsychotics and analgesics. There are also a number of other interventions that target delirium risk factors related to surgery and perioperative care, such as varying approaches to anaesthesia, optimising blood transfusion, and postoperative pain relief.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2016-02-15 10:28:44 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>Delirium has many risk factors and precipitating factors, some of which may be modifiable. Previous work has suggested that a combination of risk factors may interact to increase vulnerability to delirium, and models to predict this risk have been developed and validated (<LINK REF="STD-Inouye-1993a" TYPE="STUDY">Inouye 1993a</LINK>). Measures to reduce the number or severity of these factors may help to prevent delirium and may attenuate the poor outcomes associated with it.</P>
<P>Single- and multi-component non-pharmacological interventions target one or more of these risk factors.</P>
<P>Pharmacological interventions either target the important neurotransmitter pathways that have been implicated in the complex pathophysiology of delirium ((e.g. antipsychotics, cholinesterase inhibitors) or aim to address important risk factors such as sleep and pain (e.g. melatonin and gabapentinoids).</P>
<P>Various anaesthetic approaches and perioperative procedures also address potential risk factors for delirium.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2016-01-23 23:28:52 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Given that delirium is associated with such poor outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-Witlox-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Witlox 2010</LINK>), which do not appear to be modified with treatment (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2010</LINK>), interventions to prevent delirium may be particularly important. Previous reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Cole-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cole 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Milisen-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Milisen 2005</LINK>) have suggested a role for multi-component delirium prevention interventions, but have not been systematic or have employed less rigorous selection criteria. A previous Cochrane review of delirium prevention in hospitalised patients published in 2007 found the evidence was sparse and recommended further research was needed (<LINK REF="REF-Siddiqi-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Siddiqi 2007</LINK>). It is currently unclear whether interventions for prevention of delirium are effective.</P>

<P>Two review authors used a piloted data extraction form to extract data on each study independently, and settled any disagreements by consensus. We created a table of 'Characteristics of included studies' using Review Manager 5 (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2012</LINK>). Review authors were not blinded to study authors and institution for study selection, data extraction or quality assessment. Reports from the same study were collated under a single study reference.</P>
<P>For delirium incidence and severity, where results were presented for multiple time points and no summary data were available, we used the highest recorded number or peak values for the intervention and control arm. This was because we were interested in interventions that reduced the overall burden of delirium. For example, if delirium severity was ascertained on days one, three, and five of the hospital stay, then we included only the highest of those three ascertainments in our analysis of delirium severity.</P>
<P>For severity and duration of delirium, data were included only from patients with delirium.</P>
<P>To allow use of more of the reported data for syntheses, where medians and Interquartile ranges (IQR) or ranges were presented rather than means and standard deviations, we converted values as follows. We assumed the median value was equivalent to the mean. We estimated the standard deviation as 'IQR/1.35' or 'range/4' (small studies, n &lt; 70) or 'range/6' (larger studies, n &gt; 70).</P>

Individual components of each multi-component intervention are summarised in <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>. The number of components varied between two (<LINK REF="STD-Jeffs-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Jeffs 2013</LINK>) and 13 (<LINK REF="STD-Hempenius-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Hempenius 2013</LINK>) (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>). Most included individualised care, an educational component, reorientation, and early mobilisation. Many of the delirium risk factors targeted with multi-component interventions relate to good basic care. The nature in which interventions were implemented varied between the studies: some relied on a protocol-driven approach (<LINK REF="STD-Bonaventura-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Bonaventura 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jeffs-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Jeffs 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Marcantonio-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Marcantonio 2001</LINK>), whilst others were more pragmatic in the delivery of the intervention (e.g. the family delivered the reorientation intervention in <LINK REF="STD-Martinez-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Martinez 2012</LINK>). Two studies were based on therapist interventions (<LINK REF="STD-Abizanda-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Abizanda 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jeffs-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Jeffs 2013</LINK>), one was multidisciplinary including a Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment (<LINK REF="STD-Lundstrom-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Lundstrom 2007</LINK>), and two were based on proactive perioperative input from a geriatrician (<LINK REF="STD-Hempenius-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Hempenius 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Marcantonio-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Marcantonio 2001</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Pharmacological interventions</HEADING>
<P>Thirteen studies assessed various pharmacological agents.</P>
<P>Although the pathophysiology of delirium remains unclear, acetylcholine is the neurotransmitter that has been most implicated in studies (<LINK REF="REF-Koponen-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Koponen 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tune-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tune 1999</LINK>), leading to suggestions that cholinesterase inhibitors may have a role in delirium management. Four studies tested the use of prophylactic cholinesterase inhibitors (<LINK REF="STD-Liptzin-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Liptzin 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Marcantonio-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Marcantonio 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Munger-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Munger 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sampson-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Sampson 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>Three studies assessed antipsychotic medication (<LINK REF="STD-Fukata-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Fukata 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kalisvaart-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Kalisvaart 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Larsen-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Larsen 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>Melatonin is a hormone that has a role in sleep/wake regulation, and may be responsible for the disruption of the sleep/wake cycle seen in delirium (<LINK REF="REF-Figueroa_x002d_Ramos-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Figueroa-Ramos 2009</LINK>). This has led to suggestions that it could have a role in delirium prevention (<LINK REF="REF-Lewis-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lewis 2004</LINK>). Melatonin supplementation has been proposed as a treatment option for delirium (<LINK REF="REF-Bourne-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bourne 2006</LINK>), and there is case report evidence of its usefulness (<LINK REF="REF-Hanania-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hanania 2002</LINK>). Two studies investigated the use of melatonin (<LINK REF="STD-Al_x002d_Aama-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Al-Aama 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-de-Jonghe-2014" TYPE="STUDY">de Jonghe 2014</LINK> ); and one used a melatonin agonist (<LINK REF="STD-Hatta-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Hatta 2014</LINK>).</P>
<P>Citicoline (cytidine 5&#8242;-diphosphocholine (CDP-choline)), is a drug that has been implicated in cognitive impairment and memory, and therefore has been proposed as a treatment in traumatic brain injury, stroke, vascular dementia, Parkinson&#8217;s disease, and brain aging (<LINK REF="REF-Fioravanti-2006a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fioravanti 2006a</LINK>). Citicoline has the function in the brain of stabilising cell membranes and reducing the presence of free radicals. In particular, there is some evidence that citicoline stimulates the release of dopamine neurotransmitters in the brain (<LINK REF="REF-Fioravanti-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fioravanti 2005</LINK>). One study tested citicoline (<LINK REF="STD-Diaz-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Diaz 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>Diazepam is a long-acting benzodiazepine which is often used as an anxiolytic and has been used in the cardiac catheterisation setting with good effect (<LINK REF="REF-Woodhead-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Woodhead 2007</LINK>). Diphyenhydramine is an antihistamine medication which can cause sedation and has been used as an adjunct for individuals undergoing colonoscopy with good effect (<LINK REF="REF-Tu-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tu 2006</LINK>). Evidence regarding premedication and postoperative delirium is unclear (<LINK REF="REF-Fines-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fines 2006</LINK>) with concern that administering these medications may increase rates of post-procedure or postoperative delirium. One study evaluated the combination of diazepam and diphenhydramine as premedication before cardiac catheterisation (<LINK REF="STD-Ashraf-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Ashraf 2015</LINK>).</P>
<P>Methylprednisolone is an intravenous steroid preparation with a wide range of clinical uses. Steroid use has been thought to be beneficial to individuals undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass, with evidence of reduction in new onset atrial fibrillation, postoperative bleeding and length of stay in the intensive care unit (ICU) (<LINK REF="REF-Whitlock-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Whitlock 2008</LINK>). A subsequent clinical trial failed to show benefit for the entire population undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass, but subgroup analysis suggested those at higher risk of adverse outcomes may benefit (<LINK REF="REF-Dieleman-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dieleman 2012</LINK>). This formed the basis of the design of <LINK REF="STD-Whitlock-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Whitlock 2015</LINK>, evaluating methylprednisolone for those at high risk undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass, with incidence of delirium as a safety outcome measure.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Perioperative interventions</HEADING>
<P>Postoperative delirium is a common complication of surgery in older people (<LINK REF="REF-Holmes-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Holmes 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Santos-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Santos 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Williams_x002d_Russo-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Williams-Russo 1992</LINK>), likely to be a consequence of the physiological and biochemical derangement induced by the underlying pathology, surgical trauma pain and anaesthesia. Perioperative care is, therefore, a potential focus for interventions to reduce postoperative delirium.</P>
<P>In surgical practice, there has been a move towards a concept of &#8216;enhanced recovery&#8217; whereby surgical intervention, anaesthesia and postoperative care are modified in such a way as to minimise the overall impact of surgery, reducing postoperative complications and expediting recovery (<LINK REF="REF-Douglas-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Douglas 2001</LINK>). Many postoperative complications (e.g. ileus, respiratory depression, chest infections, and myocardial ischaemia, all of which may predispose to delirium) could be reduced by the use of regional anaesthesia and opioid-sparing analgesics (<LINK REF="REF-Bonnet-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bonnet 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>Eighteen studies tested various interventions addressing modifications to perioperative practice that might influence postoperative delirium. These are subdivided into five broad approaches; i) those that reduce opioid utilisation, ii) those that control/reduce depth of general anaesthesia, iii) those that consider alternative forms of general anaesthesia, iv) those which avoid general anaesthesia altogether and v) a miscellaneous group including studies investigating transfusion practice, fast track surgery and a 'delirium-free protocol'.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">i) Opioid-sparing measures:</HEADING>
<P>Techniques to reduce opioid utilisation include the administration of adjuvant analgesics; addition of intrathecal opioid to general anaesthesia; and peripheral local anaesthetic blockade. These were tested in six studies.</P>
<P>Gabapentinoids are commonly used for treatment of epilepsy, anxiety, and neuropathic pain, but also have a role as opioid-sparing adjuncts for postoperative pain relief (<LINK REF="REF-Tippana-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tippana 2007</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Leung-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Leung 2006</LINK> tested gabapentin and <LINK REF="STD-Pesonen-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Pesonen 2011</LINK> tested pregabalin.</P>
<P>Ketamine is widely used as an adjuvant analgesic in a variety of perioperative pain settings (<LINK REF="REF-Bell-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bell 2006</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Urban-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Urban 2008</LINK> investigated the effect of adding ketamine at induction of anaesthesia as a postoperative infusion.</P>
<P>Parecoxib sodium is an intravenous analgesic preparation called a pro-drug of another medication, valdecoxib, which is a selective cyclo-oxygenase-2 inhibitor (<LINK REF="REF-Cheer-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cheer 2001</LINK>). The use of non-opioid adjuvant analgesia is a recognised approach to reduce the need for opiate medication and thus the associated side effects, particularly for older adults (<LINK REF="REF-Aubrun-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aubrun 2007</LINK>). One study compared a regimen of regular intravenous parecoxib to a dose of morphine followed by administration of saline as postoperative analgesia, with morphine doses available to either group based on their pain scores.</P>
<P>The use of a &#8216;single shot spinal&#8217; combined with general anaesthesia and patient controlled analgesia (PCA) is increasingly used as an alternative to continuous epidural infusions for intra and postoperative analgesia. The premise is that intrathecal opioid, with or without local anaesthetic adequately replaces an epidural regarding its intended benefits of reduced intraoperative and immediate postoperative opioid requirements, but without prolonged motor block or hypotension that would impede immediate postoperative mobilisation. <LINK REF="STD-Beaussier-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Beaussier 2006</LINK> tested using a 'single shot spinal&#8217; with general anaesthesia compared to general anaesthesia alone; and <LINK REF="STD-Mouzopoulos-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Mouzopoulos 2009</LINK> tested a fascia iliac compartment block performed every 24 hours from admission to discharge compared to treatment with paracetamol and intramuscular pethidine for patients with a fractured neck of femur.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="6">ii) Controlling/reducing the depth of anaesthesia:</HEADING>
<P>Finer titration of depth of anaesthesia could reduce delirium. Bispectral index (BIS), a number derived from analysis of the EEG, is increasingly used to monitor depth of anaesthesia. A BIS value of 100 is equivalent to full awareness and a value of 0 represents no electrical activity.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Sieber-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Sieber 2010</LINK> investigated light compared to deep sedation. Light sedation was represented by a BIS value of 80 and a patient responsive to vocal commands; and deep sedation by a BIS value of 50 and a patient unresponsive to noxious stimuli (i.e. equivalent to the effect of a general anaesthetic). <LINK REF="STD-Chan-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Chan 2013</LINK> compared BIS-guided anaesthesia to routine general anaesthesia with propofol. In the BIS-guided group, the propofol infusion was titrated to maintain a BIS value of 40 to 60, whereas in the routine group anaesthesia was titrated according to clinical judgement. <LINK REF="STD-Radtke-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Radtke 2013</LINK> compared BIS-guided and BIS-blinded groups undergoing induction and maintenance of general anaesthesia and postoperative analgesia for a range of surgical interventions. <LINK REF="STD-Gauge-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Gauge 2014</LINK> compared targeted BIS and cerebral oxygenation monitoring for patients undergoing coronary bypass grafting compared to no BIS and oxygenation monitoring.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Jia-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Jia 2014</LINK> tested fast-track surgery compared to usual care; this approach as a means of reducing delirium and postoperative cognitive dysfunction has been suggested previously (<LINK REF="REF-Krenk-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Krenk 2012</LINK>). The fast-track approach tested by <LINK REF="STD-Jia-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Jia 2014</LINK> included alterations in the preoperative preparation, anaesthesia, pain control and postoperative management compared to traditional care. This included: bowel preparation with oral purgatives rather than enemas, shorter period of fasting, avoidance of nasogastric tube, epidural rather than general anaesthesia and earlier removal of urinary catheter and mobilisation on the first postoperative day.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Aizawa-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Aizawa 2002</LINK> tested a postoperative delirium-free protocol (DFP), which contained benzodiazepines and pethidine compared to usual care.

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Care in geriatric medicine unit versus orthopaedic unit following hip fracture</HEADING>
<P>Individuals admitted following a fracture are typically placed under the care of an orthopaedic surgeon, pending operative intervention. However, the complex nature of the predominantly older adult population who experience a hip fracture has led to the emergence of orthogeriatric services, where input is also received from geriatricians. Comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) is an evidence-based "multidimensional interdisciplinary diagnostic process used to determine the medical, psychological and functional capabilities of a frail older person to develop a coordinated and integrated plan for treatment and long-term follow-up" associated with improved outcomes, particularly when delivered in a dedicated ward (<LINK REF="REF-Ellis-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ellis 2011</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Watne-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Watne 2014</LINK> designed their trial around their local service reconfiguration where older adults were admitted to their specialist geriatric medicine unit and received CGA comparing this to the care received in the orthopaedic unit.</P>

<P>In 15 studies, the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM) (<LINK REF="REF-Inouye-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Inouye 1990</LINK>) alone was used to determine delirium incidence (<LINK REF="STD-Abizanda-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Abizanda 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ashraf-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Ashraf 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Beaussier-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Beaussier 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Boustani-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Boustani 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chan-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Chan 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gauge-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Gauge 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jeffs-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Jeffs 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Leung-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Leung 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lurati-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Lurati 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Marcantonio-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Marcantonio 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Martinez-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Martinez 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Munger-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Munger 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sieber-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Sieber 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Urban-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Urban 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Whitlock-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Whitlock 2015</LINK>). However, <LINK REF="STD-Munger-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Munger 2008</LINK> presented data for the mean CAM score, rather than using the CAM score to determine delirium presence as a dichotomous outcome.

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-02-15 14:15:44 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>Evidence for the effectiveness of most interventions for preventing delirium remains uncertain, with the exception of multi-component interventions.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Multi-component interventions</HEADING>
<P>There is moderate-quality evidence from seven randomised controlled trials that multi-component interventions reduce delirium incidence, with an overall reduction in the risk of delirium by about 30% compared with usual care. Moreover, they appear to have similar effect sizes in medical and surgical study populations.</P>
<P>Despite the higher risk of delirium in patients with dementia, only one trial reported data on the incidence of delirium in this subgroup (for 50 participants); and in this study, dementia prevalence was unbalanced between intervention and control groups (<LINK REF="STD-Marcantonio-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Marcantonio 2001</LINK>). The effectiveness of these interventions in patients with dementia remains uncertain.</P>
<P>Effects on delirium duration, length of hospital admission, institutionalisation and severity of delirium are also uncertain. There is no clear evidence of effect on mortality (either inpatient, or at 12 months); 12-month mortality was only reported in one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Lundstrom-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Lundstrom 2007</LINK>). Clinically important differences are reported for cognition (in one study; 60 participants, <LINK REF="STD-Bonaventura-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Bonaventura 2007</LINK>) and pressure ulcers (two studies; 457 participants, <LINK REF="STD-Hempenius-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Hempenius 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lundstrom-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Lundstrom 2007</LINK>), all in a direction favouring multi-component interventions, although there is uncertainty in these results due to imprecision.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Pharmacological interventions</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Cholinesterase inhibitors</HEADING>
<P>We found no clear evidence of benefit for a cholinesterase inhibitor, donepezil, in preventing delirium in an elective orthopaedic population without cognitive impairment. The available evidence was judged to be very low-quality due to imprecision and considerable inconsistency.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Antipsychotic medication</HEADING>
<P>Overall, there is no clear evidence for effectiveness of antipsychotic medications as a group in delirium prevention, although there is uncertainty in this result because of imprecision and inconsistency.</P>
<P>The pre-planned subgroup analysis indicates that an atypical antipsychotic drug (olanzapine) may reduce incidence of delirium, with a potentially large effect size, but there is no clear evidence supporting effectiveness of the typical antipsychotic, haloperidol. However, it is possible that in one study of haloperidol, optimisation of non-pharmacological delirium prevention in both the intervention and control arms precluded detection of any additional benefit from medication. In the other study, haloperidol was administered on the first postoperative day for three days and this may have been too late for any preventive benefits, although this study was also at high risk of bias due its unblinded nature.</P>
<P>The impact on severity and duration of delirium also differed between two studies of haloperidol and olanzapine, but paradoxically, favoured the intervention group for haloperidol, and the control group for olanzapine. There is no clear evidence for effect of antipsychotic medication on length of hospital admission.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Melatonin</HEADING>
<P>There is no clear evidence to support effectiveness of melatonin or melatonin agonists in delirium prevention. However, there is considerable heterogeneity in results, which may have been a result of differing study populations and different dosages. <LINK REF="STD-Al_x002d_Aama-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Al-Aama 2011</LINK> reported a clinically important effect size in reducing delirium incidence in medical inpatients using 0.5 mg melatonin daily, (low-quality evidence because of incomplete follow-up); whilst <LINK REF="STD-de-Jonghe-2014" TYPE="STUDY">de Jonghe 2014</LINK> reported no effect using melatonin 3 mg daily in hip fracture patients undergoing acute surgery. Ramelteon, a melatonin agonist, has previously been proposed as a safer treatment for insomnia (<LINK REF="REF-Miyamoto-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Miyamoto 2009</LINK>), but we found no evidence of benefit in delirium prevention in one trial.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Other pharmacological interventions</HEADING>
<P>We found no evidence to support effectiveness of citicoline in reducing delirium incidence.</P>
<P>Methylprednisolone had no effect on delirium incidence.</P>
<P>In one small trial of premedication using diazepam and diphenhydramine for elective inpatient cardiac catheterisation there were no cases of delirium in either group; thus the evidence that choice of premedication affects delirium incidence remains inconclusive.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Perioperative interventions</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Opioid-sparing measures</HEADING>
<P>The evidence about the effect of gabapentin, ketamine or intrathecal and patient controlled analgesia (PCA) morphine for delirium prevention is inconclusive.</P>
<P>There was evidence that intravenous (IV) parecoxib reduced the incidence of delirium compared to morphine and saline. However, the evidence was of low quality, from a single study and affected by potential confounding related to the administration of supplementary morphine.</P>
<P>There is evidence that fascia iliaca compartment block (FICB) to manage pain in hip fracture patients is effective in reducing incidence of delirium. Lower-quality evidence also suggested that it could reduce the severity and length of delirium episodes.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Reducing/controlling the depth of anaesthesia</HEADING>
<P>Reduction in depth of general anaesthesia or controlling the depth is effective in preventing delirium. Both use of light propofol sedation compared to deep, and Bispectral index (BIS)-guided anaesthesia compared to BIS-blinded anaesthesia/clinical judgement were effective approaches.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Changing the mode of anaesthesia</HEADING>
<P>There is no evidence of difference in effect on delirium incidence of using propofol or xenon compared to sevoflurane anaesthesia.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Avoiding general anaesthesia</HEADING>
<P>The evidence for effectiveness of epidural anaesthesia compared to general anaesthesia in delirium prevention is uncertain.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Miscellaneous perioperative interventions</HEADING>
<P>There was no evidence from one study that liberal versus restrictive blood transfusion was effective in preventing delirium.</P>
<P>One study of fast-track surgery in elderly cancer patients suggested that it reduces the incidence of delirium and length of hospital admission.</P>
<P>One study which used a 'delirium-free protocol' for older adults undergoing open laparotomy is likely to have resulted in sedation of participants and failed to demonstrate any evidence of benefit on delirium incidence.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Computerised clinical decision support system (CCDSS)</HEADING>
<P>One study using a computerised clinical decision support system conducted in general and geriatric medical patients did not result in improvement in delirium incidence.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Geriatric unit care versus orthopaedic unit</HEADING>
<P>There was no evidence that care in the geriatric medicine unit reduced the incidence duration or severity of delirium or other cognitive and functional outcomes. However, geriatric unit care increased length of hospital stay compared to care in the orthopaedic unit.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2016-02-15 11:37:47 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>Although 39 trials were identified for inclusion in this review, the body of evidence for delirium prevention in hospitalised non-ICU patients remains limited, except for multi-component interventions (seven trials). Most other interventions were only investigated in one or two small trials, with considerable heterogeneity in the interventions, outcomes, populations and settings studied, precluding meta-analyses. Only one study (of a multi-component intervention in surgical patients) presented results for people with dementia, an important subgroup to study in delirium prevention. The effectiveness of delirium interventions might be expected to differ given the higher prevalence of delirium and poorer outcomes in dementia.</P>
<P>For multi-component interventions, it is likely that the included trials and meta-analyses were underpowered to detect mortality and institutionalisation (both relatively rare outcomes), and this may explain the lack of observed impact on these endpoints, despite the reduction in incident delirium.</P>
<P>Although there was evidence suggesting FICB, controlling depth of anaesthesia and fast-track surgery could reduce postoperative delirium incidence, it is important to note that in clinical practice, there will be a range of considerations apart from effectiveness in delirium prevention (including co-morbidities, falls risk, and rehabilitation requirements) guiding choice of approaches to surgery and anaesthesia. Recommendations regarding surgery and anaesthetic practice cannot, therefore, be made based on the evidence from this review alone.</P>
<P>Most studies included delirium incidence as an outcome, and both cognition and length of hospital admission were also frequently reported. However, other important outcomes including delirium duration and severity, mortality, institutionalisation, activities of daily living (ADL) performance, and adverse outcomes were not commonly reported. No studies investigated the impact on quality of life, carers' psychological morbidity, staff psychological morbidity, or costs. Future studies need to address these gaps in the interventions, settings and outcomes studied.</P>
<P>Failure to exclude prevalent delirium at enrolment was a common limitation of the majority of included studies (29/39). This has the potential to reduce precision in the results as interventions cannot prevent cases of delirium already present in recruited participants.</P>

<P>We used GRADEpro software (<LINK REF="REF-GRADEpro-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">GRADEpro 2014</LINK>) to inform the generation of evidence quality statements for five comparisons: i) multi-component interventions versus usual care; ii) cholinesterase inhibitors versus placebo; iii) antipsychotic medication versus placebo; iv) melatonin versus placebo and v) BIS-guided versus BIS-blinded anaesthesia/clinical judgement. Full tabulations for each outcome are available in: <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>, <LINK REF="SOF-02" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 2</LINK>, <LINK REF="SOF-03" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 3</LINK>, <LINK REF="SOF-04" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 4</LINK> and <LINK REF="SOF-05" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 5</LINK>.</P>
<P>On the basis of seven randomised controlled trials (RCTs) (four in medical patients and three in surgical patients) n = 1950 participants, there is moderate-quality evidence that multi-component delirium prevention interventions can reduce rates of incident delirium; this is consistent across the included trials. Evidence has been downgraded due to the possibility of performance bias (the nature of the intervention precludes blinding of participants and those delivering intervention). Outcome assessors were unblinded to the intervention in two studies, including the study with the largest weighting and highest event rate. Furthermore, there is a risk of other bias in two of the included studies due to an imbalance between the intervention and control groups in respect to the prevalence of pre-existing dementia.</P>
<P>Heterogeneity in the multi-component interventions studied makes it difficult to ascertain whether specific components of the interventions are particularly effective in the prevention of delirium.</P>
<P>There is moderate-quality evidence that multi-component interventions have no effect on length of hospital stay (six studies, n = 1920 participants) and moderate-quality evidence of no effect on the likelihood of return to independent living (four studies, n = 1116). There is considerable uncertainty regarding the effect of multi-component interventions on the duration of delirium due to unblinded outcome assessment in two studies, imbalance in the prevalence of dementia in two studies and imprecise results.</P>
<P>On the basis of two RCTs (n = 113 participants), there is considerable uncertainty regarding the effect of prophylactic cholinesterase inhibitors on reducing delirium incidence due to very low-quality evidence. Both of these studies have missing outcome data; evidence was downgraded due to imprecision and inconsistency in the results. There is low-quality evidence for the effect of prophylactic cholinesterase inhibitors on the outcome of delirium severity (one study; n = 16 participants) and length of admission (two studies; n = 128 participants). Evidence was downgraded due to serious imprecision of the delirium severity results and for imprecision and risk of bias in length of admission.</P>
<P>On the basis of three RCTs (n = 916 participants), there is considerable uncertainty regarding the effect of antipsychotic medications on the incidence of delirium due to low-quality evidence that has been downgraded because of risk of bias, inconsistency and imprecise results. There is very low-quality evidence on the effect of antipsychotic medications on the severity (two studies, n = 178 participants) and duration of delirium (two studies, n = 178 participants), and low-quality evidence on length of stay because of inconsistent and very imprecise results (one study, n = 68 participants).</P>
<P>On the basis of three RCTs (n = 529 participants), there is considerable uncertainty regarding the effect of prophylactic melatonin/melatonin agonists on the incidence of delirium due to very low-quality evidence that has been downgraded because of risk of bias, imprecise and inconsistent results. There is moderate-quality evidence that melatonin does not affect the duration of delirium, downgraded as the results are from a single study (n = 104). There is uncertainty regarding the effect of melatonin on severity of delirium due to moderate-quality evidence from one study using a binary outcome (n = 104) and low-quality evidence from a second study downgraded due to serious imprecision (n = 6). There is moderate-quality evidence that melatonin does not reduce the length of stay (two studies; 500 participants); results were downgraded for inconsistency. There is uncertainty regarding the effect of melatonin on in-hospital mortality due to low-quality evidence from three studies that was downgraded because of imprecise results and a very small number of events (n = 543 participants).</P>
<P>On the basis of two RCTs (n = 2057 participants), there is moderate-quality evidence that BIS-guided anaesthesia reduces the incidence of delirium compared to BIS-blinded anaesthesia/clinical judgement. The evidence was downgraded due to the risk of bias associated with participants and personnel being unblinded and incomplete outcome assessment. There was also an unclear risk of selection bias in <LINK REF="STD-Radtke-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Radtke 2013</LINK>. There is also moderate-quality evidence that BIS-guided anaesthesia resulted in a shorter length of hospital admission compared to BIS-blinded anaesthesia/clinical judgement (two studies, n = 2057 participants), also downgraded due to risk of bias.<BR/>

<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2016-02-15 14:16:19 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>The previous version of this review (<LINK REF="REF-Siddiqi-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Siddiqi 2007</LINK>) only included six studies, none of which assessed the same intervention. The review highlighted the potential role for multi-component intervention (a Geriatric Consultation Service) and the use of atypical antipsychotic medication, but identified the need for a larger body of evidence before drawing conclusions or practice recommendations. The evidence base for multi-component interventions for the prevention of incident delirium in hospitalised non-ICU patients has expanded considerably since the previous version, and the evidence summarised in this update supports the use of multi-component interventions. However, we found a continuing lack of evidence to support the use of antipsychotic medication as a group in the prevention of delirium.</P>
<P>Our principal review finding of the positive role of multi-component interventions to prevent delirium is consistent with the wider published literature (<LINK REF="REF-Abraha-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Abraha 2015</LINK>). The multi-component intervention programme known as the Hospital Elder Life Program (HELP) for Prevention of Delirium has demonstrated effective reductions in the incidence of delirium in non-randomised trials (<LINK REF="REF-Inouye-1999a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Inouye 1999a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Inouye-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Inouye 2000</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-Hshieh-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hshieh 2015</LINK> published a meta-analysis of intervention studies using multi-component non-pharmacological interventions and, although identifying similar issues with heterogeneity limiting reporting, found evidence to support reductions in delirium incidence and falls. Two recent systematic reviews have reached similar conclusions to those of this review. <LINK REF="REF-Martinez-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Martinez 2015</LINK> identified that multi-component interventions were effective in reducing incident delirium and accidental falls for hospitalised adults. <LINK REF="REF-Zhang-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhang 2013</LINK> specifically reviewed the role of interventions to prevent postoperative delirium and identified that multi-component interventions were beneficial, although the review also identified positive benefits from sedation and antipsychotic medications not replicated by our findings.</P>
<P>Multi-component interventions for delirium prevention are now also recognised and recommended in practice guidelines. The UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines for delirium were published in 2010 (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2010</LINK>). These identified multi-component interventions as having a critical role in identifying and addressing modifiable, clinical risk factors for delirium prevention. Multi-component assessment and intervention is recommended within 24 hours of admission for those at risk; the intervention should be personalised to the needs of the individual and delivered by a multidisciplinary team (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2010</LINK>). Cost savings are identified to be anticipated, although we found no data on this in our review.</P>
<P>The lack of impact of multi-component interventions on mortality and institutionalisation, despite a reduction in delirium is a surprising finding. Falls and institutionalisation are thought to be associated with frailty and may represent complications of the frailty syndrome (<LINK REF="REF-Clegg-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clegg 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Eeles-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eeles 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fried-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fried 2001</LINK>). Death and institutionalisation as endpoints may, therefore, represent non-modifiable manifestations of frailty, and be relatively insensitive to a reduction in incident delirium, although a recent study has questioned the association of delirium with frailty (<LINK REF="REF-Joosten-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Joosten 2014</LINK>). Reporting baseline frailty in future trials (measured with a validated frailty assessment instrument) would help to clarify this relationship.</P>
<P>Our findings for cholinesterase inhibitors are consistent with previous related studies. A large trial of another cholinesterase inhibitor, rivastigmine, for treatment of delirium in intensive care patients was halted in 2010 following safety concerns and no evidence of effectiveness (<LINK REF="REF-Sheldon-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sheldon 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-van-Eijk-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Eijk 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>Findings for antipsychotics are also consistent with a recent published review (<LINK REF="REF-Fok-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fok 2015</LINK>).</P>
<P>The heterogeneity of our results for melatonin has also been reported by Chen and colleagues (<LINK REF="REF-Chen-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chen 2015</LINK>). They conducted a subgroup analysis, and concluded that melatonin was effective in preventing delirium in medical, but not surgical patients.</P>

<P>The evidence base for multi-component interventions to prevent delirium in patients admitted to medical and surgical wards is strong and supports the adoption of systems of care that incorporate multi-component interventions to prevent delirium in hospitals as part of routine care.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2016-02-15 11:38:05 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>Further &#8220;proof of concept&#8221; randomised controlled trials investigating the effectiveness of multi-component interventions to prevent delirium in hospitalised non-ICU patients are unwarranted (and unethical, as an effective treatment is denied to the control group). The focus of future research should be trials of implementation and to identify the key 'active' components to improve our understanding of the determinants for successful and efficient deployment of multi-component interventions. Such trials should consider cluster randomisation (to minimise performance bias); incorporate more discriminatory baseline descriptors (to better account for delirium, frailty, and dementia interactions); and have at least a medium-term follow-up period (to assess the personal and system-level impact of delirium prevention). Preliminary evidence for the content of multi-component interventions suggests that they should include as a minimum: staff education; individualised care (sometimes referred to as person-centred care); re-orientation at frequent intervals; and early mobilisation, but this needs further investigation. These areas are familiar aspects of care but are currently poorly and unreliably delivered.</P>
<P>Monitoring the depth of anaesthesia through awareness of the Bispectral index (BIS) and the ability to control the level of anaesthesia reduced the incidence of postoperative delirium. However, the optimal level for depth of anaesthesia has not been established in the included studies and this remains an area for further research.</P>
<P>The role of drugs and other anaesthetic techniques (to reduce postoperative delirium) in the prevention of delirium remains uncertain with negative or conflicting findings. New research is justified, particularly regarding the role of typical and atypical antipsychotics and melatonin (including different settings, variations in physiological melatonin levels and different doses), but should account for developments in the understanding of the neuropathophysiology of delirium. In the case of atypical antipsychotics, the association between antipsychotics and increased mortality amongst older people with cognitive impairment may limit their usefulness as a prophylactic measure in this population (<LINK REF="REF-Huybrechts-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Huybrechts 2012</LINK>). Furthermore, given the current evidence base supporting the use of multi-component interventions, future trials of pharmacological agents for delirium prevention should optimise multi-component non-pharmacological delirium prevention in intervention and control arms to look for any additional benefit obtained from medication. The evidence does not support cholinesterase inhibitors for delirium prevention as a priority for further investigation.</P>

<P>Intervention: Participants randomised to the intervention arm received a graded physical activity and orientation programme twice daily, which was delivered in addition to usual care. A certified Allied Health Assistant, trained in administering exercise programmes, delivered the intervention after initial assessment of the participant by a physiotherapist. The programme started on the same day as the participant was randomised. Commensurate with ability, participants were prescribed one of four exercise programmes: bed, seated, standing or rails. All programmes were customised to the participant&#8217;s ability and were reviewed daily. Exercise programmes were modified to ensure suitable progression for those participants who made significant gains.<BR/>
</P>
<P>The orientation programme comprised formal and informal elements. The formal element of the programme comprised a series of seven questions aimed at assessing and improving orientation (day, month, year, date, ward, bed number and name of primary nurse). The participant was asked the questions in sequence and prompted with the correct answer if they were not able to give a correct response. The informal element of the programme related to engaging in the exercise programme and in the social interaction with the Allied Health Assistant and/or Physiotherapist.</P>
<P>Control: Usual care included 24-hour nursing care, daily medical assessment and allied health referral by medical, nursing or other staff. Allied health input was provided on referral only, but daily ward meetings were held to review patient progress and facilitate referrals. Patients with significant functional, cognitive or social issues could be referred to the Aged Care medical consultation service that performed a daily round and could offer advice regarding the recognition, investigation and management of geriatric syndromes including delirium.</P>

<P>Intervention: Acute geriatric ward &#8211; 20 bed ward mainly admitting patients suffering from acute medical disorder superimposed upon frailty, co-morbidities and polypharmacy. Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment was the basis for treatment planning. Assessment by geriatrician, nurse, physiotherapist and occupational therapists was expected during their first day on the ward and this team had daily meetings to plan discharge. Checklists and clinical routines based on published literature and previous experience. These included medication reviews, optimal pain control, correction of physiological disturbances preoperatively and postoperatively (hypoxaemia, anaemia, electrolyte disturbances, acid&#8211;base disturbances, dehydration, hypotension, blood sugar etc), early and intensive mobilisation, optimising pre and postoperative nutrition and early discharge planning. Outpatient orthopaedic clinic at 4 months.</P>
<P>Control: Usual care in orthopaedic ward setting. Staffing levels were similar but there was no multidisciplinary meetings and no geriatric assessments. Early mobilisation was emphasised and patients were seen by a physiotherapist soon after surgery. Outpatient orthopaedic clinic at 4 months.</P>
