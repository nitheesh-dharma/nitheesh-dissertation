<DESCRIPTION>
<P>In the first update, published in Issue 4, 2000 of <I>The Cochrane Library</I>, we extended our trial search to January 2000. We identified one new ongoing trial (Cameron 2000), and obtained new information on four included trials and two studies placed in the awaiting assessment category in the first version of this review. This extra information resulted in one included trial (Williams 1989) being excluded, and one of the two studies pending assessment being included (Espaulella 2000) and the other excluded (Pedersen 1999).</P>
<P>The inclusion of the new trial, which evaluated the effect of protein in an oral feed, and the other new information did not substantially alter the conclusions of the original review.</P>
<P>Relative risks instead of Peto odds ratios were presented for dichotomous outcomes. Again, this did not affect the conclusions of the review. <BR/>

<TITLE>Nutritional supplementation for older people after hip fracture</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2016-11-15 15:47:50 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>
<B>Background and aim</B>
</P>
<P>Older people with hip fractures are often malnourished at the time of their fracture and many have poor food intake while in hospital. Malnutrition may hinder recovery after hip fracture. We reviewed the effects of nutritional interventions in older people recovering from hip fracture.</P>
<P>
<B>Search results</B>
</P>
<P>We searched the scientific literature up to November 2015 and include 41 studies including 3881 participants. All nutritional interventions were started within one month of hip fracture. The studies had flaws in their methods that may affect the validity of their results. Some evidence was very low quality which means we are very unsure of the results.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>Eighteen studies examined the use of additional oral feeds that provided energy from sources other than protein, protein, some vitamins and minerals. There was low-quality evidence that these multinutrient oral feeds may not reduce mortality but that they may reduce the number of people with complications (e.g. pressure sore, infection, venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, confusion). There was very low-quality evidence that oral multinutrient feeds may reduce unfavourable outcome (death or complications) and that they did not result in increased vomiting and diarrhoea.</P>
<P>Four studies examined nasogastric tube feeding, where liquid food is delivered via a tube inserted into the nose and passed down into the stomach, with non-protein energy, protein, some vitamins and minerals. These studies provided very low-quality evidence that tube feeding, which was poorly tolerated, did not seem to make a difference to mortality or complications. Unfavourable outcome was not recorded and there was insufficient evidence on adverse events.</P>
<P>One study provided very low-quality evidence that nasogastric tube feeding followed by oral feeds may not affect mortality or complications. It reported that tube feeding was poorly tolerated.</P>
<P>One study provided very low-quality evidence that giving feed into a vein initially and then by mouth may not affect mortality but may reduce complications. However, we were surprised that this intervention was being used in people who seemed to be able to take nutrition orally.</P>
<P>Increasing protein intake in an oral feed was tested in four studies. These provided low-quality evidence of no clear effect on mortality or complications and very low-quality evidence for a reduction in unfavourable outcome.</P>
<P>Studies testing intravenous vitamin B1 and other water soluble vitamins, oral 1-alpha-hydroxycholecalciferol (vitamin D), high dose bolus vitamin D, different oral doses or sources of vitamin D, intravenous or oral iron, ornithine alpha-ketoglutarate versus an isonitrogenous peptide supplement, taurine versus placebo, and a supplement with vitamins, minerals and amino acids, provided low- or very low-quality evidence of no clear effect on mortality or complications, where reported.</P>
<P>One study, evaluating the use of dietetic assistants to help with feeding, provided low-quality evidence that this may reduce mortality but not the numbers of people with complications.</P>
<P>
<B>Conclusions</B>
</P>
<P>Oral supplements with non-protein energy, protein, vitamins and minerals started before or soon after surgery may prevent complications after hip fracture in older people but may not affect mortality. Adequately sized randomised studies with better design are required. We suggest that the role of dietetic assistants, and of peripheral venous feeding or nasogastric feeding in very malnourished patients, require further evaluation.</P>

<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2016-11-15 15:28:47 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two review authors independently selected trials, extracted data and assessed risk of bias. Where possible, we pooled data for primary outcomes which were: all cause mortality; morbidity; postoperative complications (e.g. wound infections, pressure sores, deep venous thromboses, respiratory and urinary infections, cardiovascular events); and 'unfavourable outcome' defined as the number of trial participants who died plus the number of survivors with complications. We also pooled data for adverse events such as diarrhoea.</P>

<P>We included 41 trials involving 3881 participants. Outcome data were limited and risk of bias assessment showed that trials were often methodologically flawed, with less than half of trials at low risk of bias for allocation concealment, incomplete outcome data, or selective reporting of outcomes. The available evidence was judged of either low or very low quality indicating that we were uncertain or very uncertain about the estimates.<BR/>
</P>
<P>Eighteen trials evaluated oral multinutrient feeds that provided non-protein energy, protein, vitamins and minerals. There was low-quality evidence that oral feeds had little effect on mortality (24/486 versus 31/481; risk ratio (RR) 0.81 favouring supplementation, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.49 to 1.32; 15 trials). Thirteen trials evaluated the effect of oral multinutrient feeds on complications (e.g. pressure sore, infection, venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, confusion). There was low-quality evidence that the number of participants with complications may be reduced with oral multinutrient feeds (123/370 versus 157/367; RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.59 to 0.86; 11 trials). Based on very low-quality evidence from six studies (334 participants), oral supplements may result in lower numbers with 'unfavourable outcome' (death or complications): RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.51 to 0.89. There was very low-quality evidence for six studies (442 participants) that oral supplementation did not result in an increased incidence of vomiting and diarrhoea (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.47 to 2.05).</P>
<P>Only very low-quality evidence was available from the four trials examining nasogastric multinutrient feeding. Pooled data from three heterogeneous trials showed no evidence of an effect of supplementation on mortality (14/142 versus 14/138; RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.50 to 1.97). One trial (18 participants) found no difference in complications. None reported on unfavourable outcome. Nasogastric feeding was poorly tolerated. One study reported no cases of aspiration pneumonia.</P>
<P>There is very low-quality evidence from one trial (57 participants, mainly men) of no evidence for an effect of tube feeding followed by oral supplementation on mortality or complications. Tube feeding, however, was poorly tolerated.</P>
<P>There is very low-quality evidence from one trial (80 participants) that a combination of intravenous feeding and oral supplements may not affect mortality but could reduce complications. However, this expensive intervention is usually reserved for people with non-functioning gastrointestinal tracts, which is unlikely in this trial.</P>
<P>Four trials tested increasing protein intake in an oral feed. These provided low-quality evidence for no clear effect of increased protein intake on mortality (30/181 versus 21/180; RR 1.42, 95% CI 0.85 to 2.37; 4 trials) or number of participants with complications but very low-quality and contradictory evidence of a reduction in unfavourable outcomes (66/113 versus 82/110; RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.65 to 0.95; 2 trials). There was no evidence of an effect on adverse events such as diarrhoea.</P>
<P>Trials testing intravenous vitamin B1 and other water soluble vitamins, oral 1-alpha-hydroxycholecalciferol (vitamin D), high dose bolus vitamin D, different oral doses or sources of vitamin D, intravenous or oral iron, ornithine alpha-ketoglutarate versus an isonitrogenous peptide supplement, taurine versus placebo, and a supplement with vitamins, minerals and amino acids, provided low- or very low-quality evidence of no clear effect on mortality or complications, where reported.</P>
<P>Based on low-quality evidence, one trial evaluating the use of dietetic assistants to help with feeding indicated that this intervention may reduce mortality (19/145 versus 36/157; RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.95) but not the number of participants with complications (79/130 versus 84/125).</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2016-11-15 15:38:49 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is low-quality evidence that oral multinutrient supplements started before or soon after surgery may prevent complications within the first 12 months after hip fracture, but that they have no clear effect on mortality. There is very low-quality evidence that oral supplements may reduce 'unfavourable outcome' (death or complications) and that they do not result in an increased incidence of vomiting and diarrhoea. Adequately sized randomised trials with robust methodology are required. In particular, the role of dietetic assistants, and peripheral venous feeding or nasogastric feeding in very malnourished people require further evaluation.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2016-11-23 13:00:16 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Hip (proximal femur) fractures are a common cause of substantial morbidity and mortality in older people living in industrialised societies (<LINK REF="REF-Kanis-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kanis 2012</LINK>). Nine months after their hip fracture people still have poorer quality of life than age and sex matched controls (<LINK REF="REF-Cranney-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cranney 2005</LINK>). Many people fail to return to their own homes and previous state of mobility after a hip fracture. In industrialised societies, mortality in the year after hip fracture may be as high as 30% (<LINK REF="REF-Bentler-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bentler 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mariconda-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mariconda 2015</LINK>), and averages 11% during the first few months after fracture (<LINK REF="REF-Lyons-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lyons 1997</LINK>). Mortality in the first four months after hip fracture surgery is age dependent. For instance, mortality was reported as 5% in people aged 50 to 69 years, compared with 28% in those people aged 90 years or over in the Scottish Hip Fracture Audit Report (<LINK REF="REF-Holt-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Holt 2008</LINK>). A meta-analysis of prospective studies found the relative hazard for mortality during the first three months following hip fracture to be 5.75 (95% CI 4.94 to 6.67) for women, and higher in men at 7.95 (95% CI 6.13 to 10.30) (<LINK REF="REF-Haentjens-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haentjens 2010</LINK>). Excess mortality was also found to persist for as long as 10 years after hip fracture for both men and women. For those who survive, acute hospital costs are substantial, but long-term costs in rehabilitation and extra care in the community are even greater (<LINK REF="REF-Dolan-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dolan 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Haentjens-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haentjens 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Johnell-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnell 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>People with hip fractures, who are more likely to be older and frailer, are often malnourished or at risk of becoming malnourished at the time of the fracture (<LINK REF="STD-Bachrach-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Bachrach 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bastow-1983a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bastow 1983a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Koren_x002d_Hakim-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Koren-Hakim 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lumbers-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lumbers 2001</LINK>). Social, psychological, physical, economic, medical and cognitive influences may all contribute to the risk of malnutrition. Dietary intake in people recovering from hip fracture in hospital is frequently suboptimal (<LINK REF="STD-Bell-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Bell 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jallut-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jallut 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lumbers-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lumbers 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nematy-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nematy 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Patterson-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Patterson 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stableforth-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Stableforth 1986</LINK>).</P>
<P>Under-nutrition leads to depressed mood, muscle wasting and reduced muscle power, and impaired cardiac function (<LINK REF="REF-Keys-1950" TYPE="REFERENCE">Keys 1950</LINK>). All of these will impair mobility and increase the tendency to develop postoperative medical complications (e.g. pneumonia, pressure sores, deep venous thrombosis) and hinder recovery, both in hospital and subsequently (<LINK REF="REF-Lennard_x002d_Jones-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lennard-Jones 1992</LINK>), increasing health and social care costs. Malnutrition also impairs the immune response, which will enhance the risk of postoperative infection (<LINK REF="REF-Lesourd-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lesourd 1997</LINK>). Poor nutritional status is associated with an increased risk of pressure ulcers after hip fracture (<LINK REF="REF-Lindholm-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lindholm 2008</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2016-09-24 18:57:50 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Examined in this review are nutritional interventions started within the first month after a hip fracture that are aimed at improving recovery from hip fracture by increasing the intake of energy, protein, vitamins and minerals, alone or in combination. Nutrition interventions can be provided by various routes: oral (by mouth), enteral (tube feeding into the stomach or small bowel, including percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy) or parenteral (intravenous and intramuscular), also alone or in combination. Also considered are interventions that revolve round the administration of nutrition, such as the use of dietetic assistants in hospital.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2016-11-15 16:01:06 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is an association between frailty, including that related to nutrition, and unfavourable outcomes following a hip fracture. Modification of nutritional status in the rehabilitation period, particularly early on, could be beneficial in reducing functional decline and reducing complications.</P>
<P>Making links between nutritional status and fracture recovery is complicated by the fact that markers of dietary protein depletion measured in blood, such as albumin, prealbumin, and transferrin are partly affected by fluid shifts and responses to injury and infection. Nevertheless, associations have been shown between low serum albumin and increased postoperative complications and poorer survival (<LINK REF="REF-Foster-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Foster 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Patterson-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Patterson 1992</LINK>). Another factor that has been implicated is vitamin C, which is required for an effective immune response and collagen formation required for wound healing. Low leucocyte vitamin C levels have been associated with the development of pressure sores in people with hip fracture (<LINK REF="REF-Brown-1992a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brown 1992a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Goode-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goode 1992</LINK>).</P>
<P>More direct markers of nutritional status are anthropometric indices, such as weight in relation to height, triceps skinfold for body fat, and mid-upper arm circumference for muscle and fat mass. People with hip fracture have lower triceps skinfold and mid-upper arm circumference than healthy people in the same age category (<LINK REF="REF-Mansell-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mansell 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nematy-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nematy 2004</LINK>). In a study of 744 people with hip fracture, <LINK REF="REF-Bastow-1983a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bastow 1983a</LINK> found that low triceps skinfold and arm muscle circumference was associated with lower calorie intake on the ward and predicted poorer survival after hip fracture.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2016-09-24 19:01:37 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>As described above, people with hip fracture are sometimes undernourished, and poor food intake may occur during routine care, hindering recovery. There is therefore an argument for nutritional supplementation in this group, and consequently a need to evaluate the use of nutrition interventions in this group of people by examining the evidence from relevant randomised controlled trials. This is the seventh update of our Cochrane review first published in 2000, and previously updated in 2010. The previous update (<LINK REF="REF-Avenell-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Avenell 2010</LINK>) continued to point to the insufficiency of the available evidence to draw robust conclusions.</P>

</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2016-08-01 14:53:16 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>To review the effects (benefits and harms) of nutritional interventions in older people recovering from hip fracture.</P>
<P>We considered comparisons where people with hip fracture, who were randomly allocated a nutritional intervention, including supplements, were compared with those allocated to no intervention or placebo. Where possible, effects were examined according to pre-existing nutritional status: malnourished or not malnourished.</P>
<P>We also considered comparisons between nutritional interventions if these were compared in a randomised controlled trial.</P>

<P>We included trials of older people recovering from any type of hip fracture. It was anticipated that most participants would be over 65 years of age. If the number of younger participants was relatively small, and provided there was adequate randomisation with unbiased distribution of this age group between the intervention and control groups, we retained them. Trials that focused specifically or mainly on younger people, people with multiple trauma or people with pathological fractures (e.g. cancer-related fractures) were excluded. We also excluded trials published before 1980 with undefined geriatric populations or with mixed populations with fewer than five participants with hip fracture in each intervention group.</P>
<P>Studies reporting results on mixed populations of orthopaedic or other geriatric patients were only included, either if separate data were available from the participants with fracture of the hip, or when contact with the study authors resulted in the provision of such data.</P>

Interventions included those evaluating the administration of nutrition, such as the use of dietetic assistants. The interventions examined were started within the first month after hip fracture, and given for up to one year. Trials evaluating intravenous fluid administration in the immediate postoperative period for hydration purposes were excluded.</P>
<P>Interventions included multinutrient supplements (providing non-protein energy, protein, vitamins and minerals) given orally, enterally or intravenously, compared with supplements containing less or none of these components, or no treatment. We included interventions of vitamins, minerals, amino acids or related compounds compared with lower doses, placebo or no treatment. We also included trials examining different policies to provide nutrition, for example, additional assistance from dietetic assistants.</P>

<P>Postoperative complications were reported as a very wide variety of individual conditions (including aspiration pneumonia, gastrointestinal ulcer, pressure sore, face flushing, deep hip joint infection, chest infection, urinary tract infection, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, stroke, thrombophlebitis, ischaemic heart disease, cardiac failure, anaemia, hyponatraemia, confusion, anaphylaxis, and acute renal failure) and generic complications (gastrointestinal, surgical, infection, postoperative, life-threatening). It was not possible to undertake analyses according to the severity or type of complication. Putative side-effects of supplementation are also presented separately. Those presented for individual studies are noted in the <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>. In order to give a more complete picture of morbidity, we opted to present the number of participants with complications at the end of individual studies. Results were not used from those studies, such as <LINK REF="STD-Tkatch-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Tkatch 1992</LINK>, which provided the numbers of complications but not the numbers of participants with complications. Results from <LINK REF="STD-Houwing-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Houwing 2003</LINK> were also not pooled since this trial only recorded pressure sores.</P>
<P>For some trials we have presented the numbers of trial participants with 'unfavourable outcome'. As defined above, this is the sum of the participants who had died plus the survivors with complications. For most studies, we could not deduce this result from the available data. Results for 'unfavourable outcome' based on a slightly different definition (mortality or survivors with a major complication or two or more minor complications) originally presented in <LINK REF="STD-Delmi-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Delmi 1990</LINK>, were available for three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Delmi-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Delmi 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hankins-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Hankins 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tkatch-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Tkatch 1992</LINK>) and we have used in them this review.</P>

Generally, we have presented the results for other outcomes using denominators based on the numbers of participants available at follow-up. Exceptions to this are noted below.</P>
<P>Lengths of hospital stay in the acute hospital and rehabilitation hospital were often reported but we have not presented them in the analyses, or pooled them. This is because, even when means and standard deviations (SD) for these outcomes were reported, it was unlikely that lengths of stay were normally distributed.</P>

<P>The variety of interventions examined for hip fracture recovery and outcomes limited data synthesis, with the exception of multinutrient supplements providing non-protein energy, protein, some vitamins and minerals. The failure to confirm an effect does not mean that there is no effect, but may simply reflect few trials, poor study design and inadequate sample size.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Multinutrient supplementation</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Oral supplements</HEADING>
<P>Eighteen trials evaluated oral multinutrient feeds that provided non-protein energy, protein, vitamins and minerals. There was low-quality evidence that oral supplementation had little effect on mortality, with the 95% confidence interval (CI) including the possibility that oral supplementation could result in lower or higher mortality (risk ratio (RR) 0.81 favouring supplementation, 95% CI 0.49 to 1.32; 968 participants, 15 studies). Based on an illustrative risk of mortality of 72 per 1000 people with hip fracture (median mortality risk at 1 to 12 months' follow-up from study control groups featuring at least one death), this equates to 13 fewer deaths per 1000 (95% CI 36 fewer to 23 more deaths) over 1 to 12 months' follow-up. In high risk populations (i.e. people over 80 years old with an estimated mortality of 250 per 1000; <LINK REF="REF-Bentler-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bentler 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mariconda-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mariconda 2015</LINK>), this equates to 47 fewer deaths per 1000 (95% CI 127 fewer to 78 more deaths; <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>). A subgroup analysis separating out trials that did or did not target malnourished people did not confirm a difference in treatment effect between the two subgroups.</P>
<P>There was low-quality evidence that oral supplementation resulted in fewer complications (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.59 to 0.86; 727 participants, 11 studies). Based on an illustrative risk of postoperative complications of 443 per 1000 people with hip fracture, this equates to 128 fewer people with complications per 1000 (95% CI 62 to 181 fewer) over 1 to 12 months' follow-up. In moderate risk populations (i.e. people in the study by <LINK REF="REF-Mariconda-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mariconda 2015</LINK> with a complication rate of 290 per 1000), this equates to 84 fewer people per 1000 (95% CI 40 to 119 fewer complications).</P>
<P>Based on very low-quality evidence, oral supplements may result in lower numbers of 'unfavourable outcome' (death or complications): RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.51 to 0.89; 334 participants, 6 studies. As seen in <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>, based on an illustrative risk of unfavourable outcomes for 500 per 1000 people with hip fracture, this equates to 165 fewer people with unfavourable outcomes per 1000 (95% CI 45 to 245 people with fewer unfavourable outcomes) over 1 to 12 months' follow-up.</P>
<P>There was very low-quality evidence that oral supplementation did not result in an increased incidence of vomiting and diarrhoea (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.47 to 2.05; 442 participants, 6 studies).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Nasogastric tube feeding</HEADING>
<P>Four trials examined nasogastric multinutrient feeding. As summarised in <LINK REF="SOF-02" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 2</LINK>, there was very low-quality evidence that nasogastric tube feeding did not reduce mortality (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.50 to 1.97; 280 participants, 3 studies; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 69%). Based on an illustrative risk of mortality of 156 per 1000 people with hip fracture, this result equates to 1 fewer death per 1000 (95% CI 88 fewer to 152 more deaths) over 1 to 12 months. There was very low-quality evidence from just one study of 18 male participants of no clear difference between nasogastric tube feeding and no supplementation in complications following hip fracture surgery at six months' follow-up (7/8 versus 8/10; RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.64). No study reported on unfavourable outcome (death or complication). Tube feeding was often poorly tolerated. There was no report of aspiration pneumonia. While 18 intervention group participants (28% of 64) had diarrhoea in one study, only two were attributed to tube feeding and the control rate was not reported.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Nasogastric tube feeding and oral supplements</HEADING>
<P>There is very low-quality evidence from one trial of 57 participants, most of whom were male, of no clear effect of tube feeding followed by oral supplementation on mortality or complications. Tube feeding, however, was poorly tolerated.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Intravenous feeding and oral supplements</HEADING>
<P>There is very low-quality evidence from one trial of 80 participants that a combination of intravenous feeding and oral supplements may not affect mortality but could reduce complications. However, it is notable that intravenous feeding is an expensive, technically complex intervention that is usually reserved for people with non-functioning gastrointestinal tracts, which is unlikely in this trial and thus the evidence was downgraded for 'indirectness'.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Nutritional status subgroup analysis</HEADING>
<P>There was no evidence of a difference in risk or benefit between the results (mortality and participants with complications) of trials specifically targeting malnourished participants and those not targeting this population. Thus, there is no clear evidence to confirm that malnourished participants are more likely to benefit from multinutrient supplementation than those participants who are not malnourished.

</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Increasing protein intake</HEADING>
<P>The four studies testing the effects of a higher protein intake are flawed by their failure to account for all participants. In particular, the results for mortality (greater in the high protein group) and 'unfavourable outcome' (fewer in the high protein group for <LINK REF="STD-Espaulella-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Espaulella 2000</LINK> are contradictory and while many reasons for this, including that of random variation, can be put forward, none can be confirmed. Overall, there was low-quality evidence of no clear effect of a higher intake of protein on mortality (4 trials) or number of complications (data not presented from two trials) and very low-quality evidence for a reduction in unfavourable outcome. There was no evidence that higher protein intake led to an increase in adverse events such as nausea or diarrhoea.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Other supplements</HEADING>
<P>No evidence can be found from the two studies of <LINK REF="STD-Day-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Day 1988</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Hoikka-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Hoikka 1980</LINK> to recommend the supplementation of vitamin B1 and other water soluble vitamins, or 1-alpha-hydroxycholecalciferol. Giving bolus vitamin D soon after hip fracture did not appear to have a beneficial affect on mortality or adverse events. Giving vitamin D2 compared to vitamin D3, or 2000 IU vitamin D3 daily compared to 800 IU vitamin D3 also did not appear to influence outcomes. Intravenous or oral iron supplementation did not appear to help recovery, and may increase gastrointestinal adverse events.</P>
<P>Vitamin, mineral and amino acid supplementation was reported to improve functional recovery in one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Scivoletto-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Scivoletto 2010</LINK>). However more than half the participants were lost to follow-up, so this very low-quality evidence should be interpreted with great caution. Based on low-quality evidence, there was no beneficial effect of providing taurine supplements during the first six postoperative days on postoperative mortality or complications including requirement for blood transfusion in one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Van-Stijn-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Van Stijn 2015</LINK>). Ornithine alpha-ketoglutarate, compared with an isonitrogenous peptide supplement, may delay the onset of complications post hip-fracture, but this is based on very low-quality evidence from one unpublished study (<LINK REF="STD-Bean-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Bean 1994</LINK>) and no benefit on reducing the risks of postoperative complications. No trials examined the effect of specific amino acid formulations.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Dietetic assistants</HEADING>
<P>Based on low-quality evidence, the use of dietetic assistants may reduce mortality but there is no clear effect on complications or length of hospital stay. <LINK REF="STD-Duncan-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Duncan 2006</LINK> reported increased consumption of supplements and greater patient satisfaction in the intervention group. These favourable results need to be checked in further randomised controlled trials involving more hospitals.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2016-11-16 17:55:46 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Given that people with hip fracture are often malnourished, it is notable that this review gives no clear evidence that those who are malnourished are more likely to benefit from multinutrient supplementation than those who are not malnourished. The lack of difference in results of trials may be due not only to the small sample sizes, but also to the different definitions of malnutrition in individual trials. Possibly people who are malnourished benefit more from nutritional supplementation, but their malnutrition could be a marker for other co-morbidities which are more important in determining outcomes. Many of the most frail participants, who are more likely to be malnourished, were excluded from these trials, for example, participants with cognitive impairment.</P>
<P>Incomplete compliance with nutritional supplementation was a major problem in these studies. Inability to tolerate nasogastric tubes and problems with palatability of oral feeds are common, particularly in confused, frail people. Malnutrition in itself produces mental apathy (<LINK REF="REF-Keys-1950" TYPE="REFERENCE">Keys 1950</LINK>), which may further reduce supplement intake. Ensuring increased nutritional intake thus has a major implication for nursing care, and has ethical implications when a person appears unwilling to feed or tolerate nasogastric feeding. While the combined intervention of nutritional supplementation and exercises investigated in <LINK REF="STD-Miller-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 2006</LINK> was excluded from this review, the potential interaction between these two interventions merits further investigation.</P>
<P>Nasogastric feeding, if tolerated, allows the provision of higher supplements of energy (3.90 MJ to 6.28 MJ, or 933 kcal to 1500 kcal daily, in the studies in this review), whereas oral supplements in the studies reviewed here generally provided under 2.51 MJ (800 kcal) daily. Thus nasogastric feeding, which potentially has more risk of complications, is likely to be targeted at those requiring higher levels of supplementation. Attempts to overcome the poor palatability of oral supplements, and thus increase intakes further, include special high energy hospital meals and the provision of frequent small snacks (<LINK REF="REF-Gall-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gall 1998</LINK>). Related to this are other measures taken to encourage consumption of food by patients. For example, one of the excluded studies examined the effects of actively involving patients in their own dietary care, a procedure based on Salling's nursing model involving a dietary journal, information, guidance and instruction (<LINK REF="STD-Pedersen-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Pedersen 1999</LINK>). Dietetic assistants may be another way to increase food and supplement intake, as in <LINK REF="STD-Duncan-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Duncan 2006</LINK>, which requires examination in further research, including an economic evaluation.</P>
<P>Intravenous feeding used in <LINK REF="STD-Eneroth-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Eneroth 2006</LINK> provided an additional 1000 kcal and 53 g protein daily, thus also allowing higher levels of supplementation. However, it also carried risks of fluid and electrolyte imbalance, hyperglycaemia and thrombophlebitis when delivered through a peripheral vein.</P>
<P>Nutritional supplementation should also be viewed in the context of general nutrition in hospitals. Given the high numbers of hip fracture patients with prior malnutrition, and the prolonged length of stay, it is surprising that nutrition, including the provision and uptake of basic foodstuffs, is often understated, or even overlooked, as a component of rehabilitative care programmes.</P>
<P>There is interest in the hypothesis that nutritional supplementation may attenuate bone loss after fracture, which may also help to decrease the risk of further fractures (<LINK REF="REF-Sch_x00fc_rch-1998a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schürch 1998a</LINK>).</P>

<P>Following the GRADE assessment for the primary outcomes in this review, the quality of the evidence ranged from very low to low. For details for the oral and nasogastric multinutrient supplementation comparisons, please see <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK> and <LINK REF="SOF-02" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 2</LINK>. Overall, the evidence was downgraded two or three levels due to a high risk of bias, limitations in the detailed design and execution of the trials, imprecision of the data and, less frequently, inconsistency and indirectness. Items for risk of bias assessment were often inadequately reported. The studies were often small and limited further by insufficient ascertainment of important outcomes, incomplete outcome data (especially for secondary outcomes), inadequate period of follow-up for recovery from fracture and selective reporting of outcomes. Due to the small number of events such as unfavourable outcomes and complications, the evidence was frequently downgraded due to imprecision. This was particularly the case for interventions that were tested by only a small number of trials.</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2016-10-25 22:20:44 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We think that it is unlikely that the review process itself has introduced bias. Our search, updated fully on a regular basis, is comprehensive and we actively pursued unpublished trials and data as well as ongoing and newly registered trials. We have used robust methodology, including independent trial selection and review of included trials, throughout the review and updating processes. One potential issue is that we have pooled mortality, participants with complications, and unfavourable outcome data irrespective of length of follow-up. While, the influence of nutritional supplementation is more likely in the period immediately after hip fracture, we do not anticipate that our mixed follow-up approach would bias the results. In future updates, we will consider whether quality of life should become a main outcome. </P>

Nasogastric feeding was poorly tolerated, but this and the insufficiency of the evidence from randomised trials does not rule out consideration of this intervention for very malnourished patients with extremely poor intakes not responsive to multinutrient oral supplements.</P>
<P>There is low-quality evidence that increasing protein intake in an oral feed had no clear effect on mortality or complications.</P>
<P>Although tested in just one trial and needing confirmation, there is low-quality evidence suggesting the use of dietetic assistants to help with feeding may reduce mortality but not the number of participants with complications.</P>
<P>Since the evidence for other comparisons made usually by single trials was of very low quality and insufficient to inform practice, these are not described here.</P>

<P>Large, well-designed, adequately powered, preferably multi-centre trials are required. Such trials should stratify allocation according to basic nutritional status to enable robust a priori subgroup analysis. Future research should examine functional status (using standardised methods), the level of care required, compliance, patient-perceived quality of life, and direct and indirect costs after hip fracture. These are in addition to mortality, individual complications and length of stay in hospital and rehabilitation. An independent observer should assess outcomes and the period of follow-up should be at least one year. The design and reporting of any future trial should conform to the CONSORT statement or any future development of it (<LINK REF="REF-Begg-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Begg 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moher-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schulz-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 2010</LINK>). We propose the focus of these randomised trials should be on the following.</P>
<UL>
<LI>Oral multinutrient supplementation, by sip feeds and changes to the hospital diet and snacks. These trials should seek to be as inclusive of the patient population as possible. As well as provision of these supplements, the use of extra staff to help with feeding, e.g. dietetic assistants, should be explored further.</LI>
<LI>Nasogastric or intravenous multinutrient supplementation. These trials should be conducted only in the most malnourished patients, where oral supplementation is unable to provide sufficient intake.</LI>
</UL>
<P>Additionally, information on nutritional status and use of supplements should be collected in audits of hip fracture management. Such data could be used to investigate the relationship of nutritional status to outcome.</P>

<P>We made the following changes in this update (2016).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Types of interventions</HEADING>
<P>In response to feedback from an external referee, we added clarification that the nutritional interventions covered in this review were aimed at improving recovery from hip fracture.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Risk of bias</HEADING>
<P>In the protocol and previous versions of this review (<LINK REF="REF-Avenell-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Avenell 2010</LINK>), we assessed methodological quality using a subject-specific modification of the former generic evaluation tool developed by the Cochrane Bone, Muscle and Joint Trauma Group. In this update, we have changed to assessing the risk of bias of all included trials using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Outcomes</HEADING>
<P>In this update to the review, we do not report on the following outcomes, which were listed under 'Other outcomes' in previous versions of this review (<LINK REF="REF-Avenell-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Avenell 2010</LINK>):</P>
<UL>
<LI>changes in anthropometric indices, such as weight, skinfold thickness, and mid-upper arm circumference</LI>
<LI>new fractures</LI>
<LI>changes in bone mineral density, assessed by techniques involving radiation, for example dual photon absorptiometry, dual energy X-ray absorptiometry, quantitative computed tomography</LI>
<LI>changes in nutritional indicators measured in blood, such as albumin, transferrin, vitamin and mineral levels, haemoglobin</LI>
<LI>changes in functional markers of nutritional status, including delayed cutaneous hypersensitivity (a marker of immune function) and grip strength</LI>
</UL>

<P>This trial appears to form part of one of three consecutive studies published in the PhD thesis of Driver (Driver LT. Evaluation of supplemental nutrition in elderly orthopaedic patients [PhD thesis]. Surrey (UK): Univ. of Surrey, 1994). All three studies evaluated nutritional supplementation in a combined group of people with hip fracture and elective hip replacement. There were major defects in the randomisation process, as well as numerical discrepancies, which suggest intention-to-treat problems. We have been unable to contact Driver to obtain clarification of the status of the three studies, the trial populations and further specific information on the participants with hip fracture. For the purposes of this review, the 3 studies have been represented as 1 trial.</P>

<P>We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Specialised Register (September 2008), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (<I>The Cochrane Library </I>2008, Issue 3), MEDLINE (1966 to July 2008), Nutrition Abstracts and Reviews (1984 to July 2008), EMBASE (1980 to week 32 2008), BIOSIS (1985 to 14 August 2008), CINAHL (1982 to August week 2 2008), and HEALTHSTAR (1975 to March 2002).</P>
<P>In MEDLINE (Ovid) the first two phases of the standard Cochrane search strategy (Higgins 2006) were combined with subject-specific terms. This strategy was modified for use in other databases. No language restrictions were applied.</P>
<P>We also searched <A HREF="http://controlled-trials.com/">Current Controlled Trials</A> (14 August 2008), <A HREF="http://apps.who.int/trialsearch/Default.aspx">WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform</A> (6 October 2009) and the <A HREF="https://portal.nihr.ac.uk/Pages/NRRArchiveSearch.aspx">National Research Register (NRR) Archive</A> (to September 2007) to identify ongoing trials.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Searching other resources</HEADING>
<P>We handsearched Nutrition Abstracts and Reviews (publication database) from 1960 to 1983; Clinical Nutrition: Clinical nutrition: official journal of the European Society of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition vol 1 to vol 27 (3) 2008; American Journal of Clinical Nutrition vol 2 to vol 88 (2) 2008; Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition vol 1 to vol 32 (2) 2008; and Proceedings of the Nutrition Society vol 1 to vol 67(3) 2008. We also checked reference lists of articles, searched books related to orthopaedics, geriatric medicine and nutrition, and corresponded with colleagues and investigators.</P>

<P>Overall, of the 66 studies identified via the search strategy: 24 are included, 36 are excluded, four are ongoing and two are awaiting assessment.</P>
<P>Only 13 included trials were identified via the MEDLINE search strategy. One further trial (<LINK REF="STD-Stableforth-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Stableforth 1986</LINK>), located via EMBASE, was indexed by MEDLINE, but was not retrieved by the first two phases of the optimum Cochrane search strategy for randomised controlled trials (<LINK REF="REF-Dickersin-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dickersin 1994</LINK>; Higgins 2006). BIOSIS yielded two further studies (<LINK REF="STD-Bean-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Bean 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Brown-1992b" TYPE="STUDY">Brown 1992b</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Gallagher-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Gallagher 1992</LINK> was initially found from handsearching the Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition, but also appeared in the reference list of another published trial. <LINK REF="STD-Bean-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Bean 1994</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Gallagher-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Gallagher 1992</LINK> were only available as abstracts from conference proceedings.

A separate examination of the search strategy and findings prior to 2001 is available (<LINK REF="REF-Avenell-2001a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Avenell 2001a</LINK>).
