<P>
<B>Review question</B>
</P>
<P>What is the effect of mild hypothermia (body temperature cooling) following a brain injury on whether a person dies, has a poor outcome, or gets a type of severe chest infection (pneumonia)?</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>Hypothermia has been used for many years to treat people who have had a severe brain injury. This involves cooling the head or the whole body to a temperature below normal body temperature. We aimed to assess whether people treated with hypothermia after a brain injury are less likely to die or have a poor outcome (which we defined as death, coma or severe disability) and whether using hypothermia might increase the risk of a severe chest infection called pneumonia.</P>
<P>
<B>Search date</B>
</P>
<P>Evidence is current to March 2016.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>We included 37 studies with 3110 participants. In each trial, patients were randomly divided into two groups: one group remained at normal body temperature of 36.5 to 38 °C, and the other group was cooled to a maximum of 35 °C for at least 12 hours.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>We did not combine results of these studies to assess whether hypothermia improves patient outcome. This was because the results had large differences which we could not explain. We identified some differences in the ways in which the studies were carried out and the participants that study authors had recruited, but we did not assess whether this could explain the differences in results. We did not have enough good quality evidence that was sufficiently similar to be confident that treating people who have had a severe brain injury with hypothermia will reduce the incidence of death or severe disability, or increase the incidence of pneumonia.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of evidence</B>
</P>
<P>Many of the studies were not well reported and we were unable to assess whether differences between the quality of the studies may also have affected our results. We used the GRADE approach to judge the quality of evidence. We judged the evidence for death or severe disability to be very low quality, and the evidence for pneumonia to be low quality.</P>

</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2017-08-13 15:19:05 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We ran and incorporated studies from database searches to 21 March 2016. We searched the Cochrane Injuries Group's Specialised Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, <I>The Cochrane Library</I>), MEDLINE (OvidSP), Embase Classic+Embase (OvidSP), PubMed, ISI Web of science (SCI-EXPANDED, SSCI, CPCI-S &amp; CPSI-SSH), clinical trials registers, and screened reference lists. We also re-ran these searches pre-publication in June 2017; the result from this search is presented in 'Studies awaiting classification'.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2017-09-20 01:03:36 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included randomised controlled trials of participants with closed TBI requiring hospitalisation who were treated with hypothermia to a maximum of 35 ºC for at least 12 consecutive hours. Treatment with hypothermia was compared to maintenance with normothermia (36.5 to 38 ºC).</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2017-08-14 13:03:50 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two review authors assessed data on mortality, unfavourable outcomes according to the Glasgow Outcome Scale, and pneumonia.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-09-20 01:03:47 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included 37 eligible trials with a total of 3110 randomised participants; nine of these were new studies since the last update (2009) and five studies had been previously excluded but were re-assessed and included during the 2017 update. We identified two ongoing studies from searches of clinical trials registers and database searches and two studies await classification.</P>
<P>Studies included both adults and children with TBI. Most studies commenced treatment immediately on admission to hospital or after craniotomies and all treatment was maintained for at least 24 hours. Thirty-three studies reported data for mortality, 31 studies reported data for unfavourable outcomes (death, vegetative state or severe disability), and 14 studies reported pneumonia. Visual inspection of the results for these outcomes showed inconsistencies among studies, with differences in the direction of effect, and we did not pool these data for meta-analysis. We considered duration of hypothermia therapy and the length of follow-up in collected data for these subgroups; differences in study data remained such that we did not perform meta-analysis.</P>
<P>Studies were generally poorly reported and we were unable to assess risk of bias adequately. Heterogeneity was evident both in the trial designs and participant inclusion. Inconsistencies in results may be explained by heterogeneity among study participants or bias introduced by individual study methodology but we did not explore this in detail in subgroup or sensitivity analyses. We used the GRADE approach to judge the quality of the evidence for each outcome and downgraded the evidence for mortality and unfavourable outcome to very low. We downgraded the evidence for the pneumonia outcome to low.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2017-09-13 12:45:05 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Despite a large number studies, there remains no high-quality evidence that hypothermia is beneficial in the treatment of people with TBI. Further research, which is methodologically robust, is required in this field to establish the effect of hypothermia for people with TBI.</P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2017-09-20 01:07:51 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2017-09-19 17:17:11 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2017-09-19 17:17:11 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major cause of death and disability amongst a predominantly young population. An estimated 10 million people worldwide experience severe brain injury every year (<LINK REF="REF-Langlois-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Langlois 2006</LINK>). There is, however, a lack of evidence about effective therapies in the acute care of brain-injured patients, especially children (<LINK REF="REF-Adelson-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Adelson 2003</LINK>). A long-term effort to review the literature and produce management guidelines by the American Association of Neurological Surgeons (<LINK REF="REF-Bullock-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bullock 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bullock-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bullock 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Carney-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carney 2016</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kirkpatrick-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kirkpatrick 1997</LINK>) could make few definitive statements about treatment effectiveness that were supported by strong evidence from randomised studies. These guidelines include recommendations based on high-quality evidence related to steroids, and moderate-quality evidence related to decompressive craniectomy, nutrition, infection prophylaxis, and seizure prophylaxis; other recommendations were based on a low-quality body of evidence.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2017-08-17 06:05:30 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Methods used to induce therapeutic cooling include use of cooling blankets, ice lavage or air-cooling devices. Mild to moderate hypothermia, cooling to 32 to 35 ºC, has been used in the treatment of brain injury for over 50 years (<LINK REF="REF-Fay-1945" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fay 1945</LINK>). Although there were several promising experimental studies (<LINK REF="REF-Clasen-1968" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clasen 1968</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Laskowski-1960" TYPE="REFERENCE">Laskowski 1960</LINK>) and case series (<LINK REF="REF-Sedzimir-1959" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sedzimir 1959</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shapiro-1974" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shapiro 1974</LINK>), no controlled clinical studies were performed and the therapy fell from favour. During the 1990s several investigators reported encouraging results from phase II and III randomised clinical trials (<LINK REF="REF-Clifton-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clifton 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Marion-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Marion 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shiozaki-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Shiozaki 1993</LINK>), corroborated by consistent findings of high levels of cerebral protection associated with systemic cooling in well-validated laboratory models of global ischaemia (<LINK REF="REF-Busto-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Busto 1987</LINK>). The early trials were small, single-centre investigations, which were sufficiently promising to lead to larger, multicentre trials.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2017-08-03 10:37:48 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Originally it was thought that the primary mechanism of action of temperature control therapy was a reduction in cerebral metabolic rate (<LINK REF="REF-Bering-1961" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bering 1961</LINK>). There is now evidence that mild hypothermia might also influence the excessive post-traumatic release of excitatory neurotransmitters (<LINK REF="REF-Busto-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Busto 1989</LINK>) and attenuate the opening of the blood-brain barrier (<LINK REF="REF-Smith-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smith 1996</LINK>). The main risks associated with induced systemic hypothermia are an increased risk of sepsis and pneumonia, coagulation abnormalities, and possible myocardial ischaemia and atrial fibrillation (<LINK REF="REF-Schubert-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schubert 1995</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2017-09-13 13:04:24 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>A previous version of this review did not find clear evidence of the beneficial effects of hypothermia (<LINK REF="REF-Sydenham-2009b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sydenham 2009b</LINK>). Interest has continued in the use of hypothermia for TBI as well as in other conditions with neurological damage, and research has continued. It was important to update the review to include the most recent published data.</P>

The four subgroups for mortality were: one, three, six and 12 months or more; and for unfavourable outcome were: three, six and 12 months or more (with no event data for one month). However, as some studies reported outcome data at more than one time point, it was not appropriate to complete statistical tests of subgroup interactions. Visual inspection of the data for mortality when separated by length of follow-up suggested there were no differences between groups at one, three and six months. We noted differences between groups at 12 months or more but we could not explain this and we remained concerned about unclear risk of bias across most studies included in the subgroup analysis and inconsistencies from visual inspection of the data. See <LINK REF="CMP-003.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.1</LINK>.</P>
<P>Similarly, it was not appropriate to carry out statistical tests for length of follow-up subgroups for unfavourable outcome. Visual inspection of the data showed some differences between groups, with fewer unfavourable outcomes at three months and 12 months but not at six months. Again, we remained concerned about risks of bias across studies and unexplained heterogeneity that may have influenced this result. See <LINK REF="CMP-003.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.2</LINK>.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Sensitivity analysis</HEADING>
<P>The subgroup analysis data divided by length of follow-up time presented more meaningful results overall but as these analyses included data from more than one study the overall effect estimates could not be calculated without including a unit-of-analysis error.</P>
<P>In sensitivity analyses, we removed studies that had been included at more than one time point so that data were recorded at one time point only. Therefore in <LINK REF="CMP-003.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.1</LINK>, in which study data were recorded for mortality, we assessed the impact of removing data for <LINK REF="STD-Andrews-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Andrews 2015</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Biswas-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Biswas 2002</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Marion-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Marion 1997</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Shiozaki-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Shiozaki 2001</LINK> at each time point. We remained concerned about differences in direction of results and did not calculate effect estimates in meta-analysis. Simlarly, we considered the impact of removing data for <LINK REF="STD-Biswas-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Biswas 2002</LINK> at each time point for unfavourable outcome but did not calculate effect estimates owing to differences in the remaining studies.</P>
<P>We removed studies that had an unclear or high risk of selection bias, therefore we collected data for eight possible studies for our primary outcomes (<LINK REF="STD-Adelson-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Adelson 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Andrews-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Andrews 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Beca-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Beca 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Clifton-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Clifton 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Harris-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Harris 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hutchison-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Hutchison 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Marion-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Marion 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Qiu-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Qiu 2007</LINK>). There remained apparent differences between the study results that did not justify calculation of a pooled effect estimate. We did not consider the impact of other types of bias in these eight studies or in the remaining studies in a sensitivity analysis.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-09-13 12:59:05 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included 37 studies that assessed the effect of hypothermia on participants with TBI.</P>
<P>We identified inconsistencies from visual inspection of the results of our included studies and did not perform meta-analysis for review outcomes. Studies showed differences in the direction of effect and attempts to explore this through subgroup analysis by duration of hypothermia and length of follow-up, and sensitivity analysis by assessment of risk of bias, did not explain these differences. We used <LINK REF="REF-GRADEpro-GDT-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">GRADEpro GDT 2015</LINK> to downgrade the evidence for each of our outcomes by one level for inconsistency.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2017-09-20 01:07:51 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We completed a thorough search for the 2017 update of this review, carrying out both backward and forward citation tracking of included studies. We used the search strategies delineated in a previous version of this review (<LINK REF="REF-Sydenham-2009b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sydenham 2009b</LINK>). All 37 studies included in the review provided evidence applicable to patients who have sustained a closed TBI and who had been treated with a method to induce hypothermia after injury. Most studies initiated treatment immediately after injury, although some studies commenced treatment within 24 hours or 48 hours and one study included participants who had received a brain injury within 10 days (<LINK REF="STD-Andrews-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Andrews 2015</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Andrews-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Andrews 2015</LINK> also included some participants who had been assessed with a Glasgow Coma Score of nine or above on admission. This introduced an element of indirectness into the results and we used <LINK REF="REF-GRADEpro-GDT-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">GRADEpro GDT 2015</LINK> to downgrade the evidence by one level.</P>
<P>It is possible that inconsistencies that we identified in the results may be explained by the differences in participants between included studies and we did not explore this during subgroup or sensitivity analysis. For example, we did not attempt to analyse data according to age of participants and we included data for adults and children within the same analyses, and we did not explore differences that may relate to the cause or type of injury. Our review considered outcome data for mortality, poor outcome, and pneumonia; we did not consider additional outcome data such as quality of life or potential adverse effects such as coagulation abnormalities, myocardial ischaemia or atrial fibrillation. We propose that future review updates include additional outcomes, and appropriate additional subgroup analyses to explore differences between study participants, for completeness of evidence.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2017-09-05 08:37:18 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Only eight studies adequately described methods of randomisation. We accepted that it was not feasible to blind personnel to the intervention in these studies, however detection bias could have been minimized by blinding of outcome assessors, particularly for the assessment of unfavourable outcome. Few studies had described this adequately. We were unable to assess the risk of selective reporting bias in 33 of the studies due to lack of prospective trial registration and we identified baseline imbalances in some studies and it was not clear if these imbalances could have influenced results. One study (<LINK REF="STD-Andrews-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Andrews 2015</LINK>) had reported an important change to the inclusion criteria part way through the study, increasing the potential length of time after brain injury from 72 hours to 10 days and the trial was stopped early because of apparent harm, which may introduce bias. We used <LINK REF="REF-GRADEpro-GDT-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">GRADEpro GDT 2015</LINK> in our assessment of study limitations to downgrade the evidence by a further level. Overall, we judged the quality of the evidence for mortality and unfavourable outcome as very low and the quality of the evidence for pneumonia as low.</P>
<P>Again, it is possible that inconsistencies that we identified in the results may be explained by issues of quality in our included studies and we did not explore this in detail during sensitivity analysis.</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2017-08-14 12:15:15 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We are confident that we identified eligible studies for this update using a thorough search strategy which was not limited by language, date of publication or publication status. We reconsidered studies during the 2017 update which had been previously excluded owing to lack of detail on randomisation methods which led to inclusion of a further five studies. However, we did not seek translation of one of these studies (<LINK REF="STD-Zhang-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Zhang 2000</LINK>) and our assessment of study methodology and risk of bias for this study was therefore limited.</P>
<P>We did not carry out a grey literature search, nor contact authors in the field to identify any unpublished studies, although visual analysis of a funnel plot did not suggest any particular risk of publication bias (<LINK REF="FIG-04" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 4</LINK>). We did not seek additional information from study authors regarding their study protocols, methods and results to clarify risk of bias, and we judged all studies equally on the information provided in the full report.</P>

<P>Previous versions of the review were titled Hypothermia for traumatic head injury (<LINK REF="REF-Alderson-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alderson 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gadkary-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gadkary 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sydenham-2009a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sydenham 2009a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sydenham-2009b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sydenham 2009b</LINK>). We changed the title to Hypothermia for traumatic brain injury and made appropriate edits throughout the review to reflect this change.</P>
<P>We edited the review Background and Methods sections to incorporate all Methodological Expectations of Cochrane Intervention Reviews (MECIR).</P>
<P>We edited the inclusion criteria to include studies with mixed head injuries if fewer than 10% of participants were described as having an open head injury, as we did not want to exclude important studies on the basis that a very small proportion of participants had an open head injury.</P>
<P>We re-assessed studies that were excluded due to insufficient information on methods of randomisation in <LINK REF="REF-Sydenham-2009b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sydenham 2009b</LINK>. We included five of these studies; we added the remaining three studies to <LINK TAG="EXCLUDED_STUDIES_DESCR" TYPE="SECTION">Excluded studies</LINK>. We removed the references of studies excluded in previous versions of the review; the studies in <LINK TAG="EXCLUDED_STUDIES_DESCR" TYPE="SECTION">Excluded studies</LINK> relate to searches and decisions made for this update.</P>
<P>We updated the 'Risk of bias' tables to incorporate assessment of all domains for all studies. We updated the <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK> tables to incorporate all MECIR requirements.</P>

<P>The search strategies for the 2017 update were slightly modified because the search interfaces on some of the databases have changed since the last update in 2009, however the search terms remain unchanged.</P>
<P>The search of the clinical trials registers was not limited by date as the search terms used previously were not reported and it was unclear how the registers were searched, the search strings are now reported in full in this appendix.</P>
<P>Studies identified from searches to March 2016 have been incorporated in this review, a study identified from a pre-publication search (1 June 2017) is presented in <LINK TAG="AWAITING_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Studies awaiting classification</LINK>.</P>
