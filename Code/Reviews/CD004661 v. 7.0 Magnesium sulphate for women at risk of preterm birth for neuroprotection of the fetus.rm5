<P>Magnesium sulphate given to women at risk of preterm birth helps to protect the baby's brain and improve long-term outcomes.</P>
<P>Babies born too early (preterm) have a higher risk of dying in the first weeks of life than babies born at term, and those who survive often have damage in the form of cerebral palsy (a disorder where the ability to move the arms or legs normally is reduced), blindness, deafness or physical disabilities. This can cause huge distress for parents. Magnesium is an important element essential for normal body functions. Magnesium sulphate may help to reduce damage to a preterm baby's brain. However, it has adverse effects in the mother of flushing, sweating, nausea, vomiting, headaches and a rapid heartbeat (palpitations). This review identified five studies involving 6145 infants and shows that magnesium sulphate therapy protects the preterm baby's brain from cerebral palsy.</P>

<P>Five trials (6145 babies) were eligible for this review.

There was also a significant reduction in the rate of substantial gross motor dysfunction (RR 0.61; 95% CI 0.44 to 0.85; four trials; 5980 infants). No statistically significant effect of antenatal magnesium sulphate therapy was detected on paediatric mortality (RR 1.04; 95% CI 0.92 to 1.17; five trials; 6145 infants), or on other neurological impairments or disabilities in the first few years of life. Overall there were no significant effects of antenatal magnesium therapy on combined rates of mortality with cerebral palsy, although there were significant reductions for the neuroprotective groups RR 0.85; 95% CI 0.74 to 0.98; four trials; 4446 infants, but not for the other intent subgroups. There were higher rates of minor maternal side effects in the magnesium groups, but no significant effects on major maternal complications.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Preterm birth and neurological outcome</HEADING>
<P>Infants born preterm have a higher risk of dying in the first weeks of life. If they survive, they have a greater risk of neurological impairments, such as cerebral palsy, blindness, deafness, or cognitive dysfunction (either developmental delay, or intellectual impairment), and a greater risk of substantial disability as a result of these neurological impairments (<LINK REF="REF-Doyle-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Doyle 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-VICS-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">VICS 1997</LINK>). Moreover, as the rate of preterm birth is rising, up to 12.8% in the United States in 2006 (<LINK REF="REF-Martin-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Martin 2007</LINK>), more babies are at risk of death and adverse neurological outcomes. Cerebral palsy and cognitive dysfunction are the most frequent neurological impairments, and any therapy that can reduce their prevalence should have a substantial effect on reducing overall neurological impairments and disabilities in surviving preterm infants.</P>
<P>Cerebral palsy is a term which includes a number of different diseases or conditions that can arise at any time during brain development that involves a disorder of movement or posture, or both, and a disorder of motor function which is permanent but may change over time (<LINK REF="REF-Oxford-Register-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oxford Register 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-SCPE-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">SCPE 2000</LINK>). The cerebral palsies remain the most frequent cause of severe motor disability in childhood with a background prevalence of two per thousand live births (<LINK REF="REF-Oxford-Register-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oxford Register 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stanley-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stanley 1994</LINK>). The life expectancy shows 92% of affected children surviving to 20 years (<LINK REF="REF-Hutton-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hutton 1994</LINK>), contributing substantially to the burden of illness into adulthood.</P>
<P>Very preterm birth (less than 34 weeks) and very low birthweight (less than 1500 g) are principal risk factors for cerebral palsy (<LINK REF="REF-Drummond-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Drummond 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lorenz-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lorenz 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pharoah-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pharoah 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Winter-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Winter 2002</LINK>) making up between 17% to 32% of all cases of cerebral palsy. Over 10% of all preterm births are from a multiple pregnancy with higher rates of cerebral palsy than singleton pregnancies. Twins have seven times and triplets 47 times the risk of cerebral palsy compared with singletons (<LINK REF="REF-Petterson-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Petterson 1993</LINK>).</P>
<P>Evidence from population-based registries shows that the prevalence of cerebral palsy in low and very low birthweight infants is rising (<LINK REF="REF-Drummond-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Drummond 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hagberg-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hagberg 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Oxford-Register-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oxford Register 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stanley-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stanley 1992</LINK>). However, not all population-based registries have reported an increase in cerebral palsy in very low birthweight survivors; some have reported a decrease (<LINK REF="REF-Himmelmann-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Himmelmann 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Surman-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Surman 2003</LINK>). Although suspected from earlier birthweight analyses, Drummond's registry study confirms that the increasing prevalence of cerebral palsy is from higher rates in preterm, not term, infants (<LINK REF="REF-Drummond-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Drummond 2002</LINK>). Intraventricular haemorrhage (IVH) is a known risk factor for the later development of cerebral palsy (<LINK REF="REF-Kuban-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kuban 1994</LINK>) with the risk of IVH and periventricular leucomalacia increasing the earlier the gestational age at birth (<LINK REF="REF-Vermeulen-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vermeulen 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>In order to reduce the impact of cerebral palsy from very preterm birth, efforts must be focused on primary prevention.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">A possible role for magnesium</HEADING>
<P>The first report that prenatal magnesium sulphate was associated with a reduction in risk of IVH, from 18.9% to 4.4%, in babies born with a birthweight less than 1500 g was by Kuban and colleagues in 1992 (<LINK REF="REF-Kuban-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kuban 1992</LINK>). A case-control analysis from the California Cerebral Palsy project investigated whether in utero exposure to magnesium sulphate was associated with a lower prevalence of cerebral palsy in infants born weighing less than 1500 g (<LINK REF="REF-Nelson-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nelson 1995</LINK>). Cases were children with cerebral palsy who were singletons and whose birthweight had been less than 1500 g. Controls were randomly sampled from live births of less than 1500 g from the same birth populations. Magnesium sulphate given to the mother during labour was associated with a marked reduction in the risk of cerebral palsy (odds ratio 0.14; 95% confidence interval 0.05 to 0.51).</P>
<P>Other observational studies have supported a reduction in cerebral palsy in preterm infants by maternal administration of magnesium sulphate (<LINK REF="REF-Hauth-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hauth 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schendel-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schendel 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wiswell-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wiswell 1996</LINK>) and some have found a reduction in the risk of IVH (<LINK REF="REF-Finesmith-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Finesmith 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Perlman-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Perlman 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wiswell-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wiswell 1996</LINK>) and perinatal mortality (<LINK REF="REF-Grether-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grether 1998</LINK>). However, not all observational studies have reported benefit for prenatal magnesium sulphate on the risk of IVH (<LINK REF="REF-Canterino-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Canterino 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kimberlin-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kimberlin 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Paneth-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Paneth 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Weintraub-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weintraub 2001</LINK>), cerebral palsy (<LINK REF="REF-Grether-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grether 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Shea-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Shea 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Paneth-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Paneth 1997</LINK>) or perinatal mortality (<LINK REF="REF-Kimberlin-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kimberlin 1998</LINK>). However, observational studies alone cannot be the basis for changing clinical practice.</P>
<P>Animal studies have shown that magnesium can provide a neuroprotective effect (<LINK REF="REF-McDonald-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">McDonald 1990</LINK>). It can prevent post hypoxic brain injury by blocking the excess release of glutamate in the calcium channel. Fetal and newborn brains seem to be more susceptible to damage from glutamate release. Consequently, blocking glutamate receptors through agents such as magnesium may reduce the risk of injury in the perinatal period (<LINK REF="REF-Espinoza-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Espinoza 1991</LINK>).</P>
<P>Magnesium sulphate is widely used in obstetrics as an anticonvulsant for the treatment of eclampsia (<LINK REF="REF-Duley-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Duley 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Duley-2003a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Duley 2003a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Duley-2003b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Duley 2003b</LINK>), prevention of eclampsia in women with pre-eclampsia (<LINK REF="REF-Duley-2003c" TYPE="REFERENCE">Duley 2003c</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sibai-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sibai 2003</LINK>); it has also been used as a tocolytic, although lacking efficacy for inhibiting preterm labour (<LINK REF="REF-Crowther-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Crowther 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>Magnesium sulphate, by its peripheral vasodilator effects when infused intravenously, produces flushing, sweating, and a sensation of warmth. Reported maternal side effects, related to dosage and speed of infusion, include nausea, vomiting, headache, palpitations and, rarely, pulmonary oedema. Administration to levels above the recommended therapeutic range can lead to respiratory depression, respiratory arrest, cardiac arrest and death. For the neonate, hypermagnesaemia can lead to hyporeflexia, poor sucking, and, rarely, respiratory depression needing mechanical ventilation (<LINK REF="REF-Levene-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Levene 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lipsitz-1971" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lipsitz 1971</LINK>).</P>

<P>We chose primary outcomes to be most representative of the clinically important measures of effectiveness and safety, including serious outcomes, for the women and their infants. We recognised that the list of outcomes was extensive and that data for some may not be available but we wanted to encapsulate the types of outcomes that may be of concern to clinicians caring for both the mother and the baby, both now and in the future. In so doing, we also recognised the increased possibility of type I errors because multiple outcomes would be evaluated.

The first four trials specifically targeted women who were likely to give birth early and magnesium was being used for neuroprotection, although one study (<LINK REF="STD-Mittendorf-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Mittendorf 2002</LINK>) also had a tocolytic arm to the study. The fifth study, the MAGPIE trial (<LINK REF="STD-Magpie-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Magpie 2006</LINK>) was designed to evaluate whether magnesium prevented eclampsia in women with pre-eclampsia; it included women at all gestational ages.

<LINK REF="STD-Crowther-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Crowther 2003</LINK> (neuroprotection)</P>
<P>A total of 1062 women with babies less than 30 weeks' gestation and in whom birth was anticipated within 24 hours were enrolled from February 1996 to September 2000 into ACTOMgSO4 (Australasian Collaborative Trial of Magnesium Sulphate). Women were excluded if birth was imminent (they were in second stage of labour), if they had already received magnesium sulphate during the pregnancy, or if there were contraindications to magnesium sulphate therapy. There were 16 collaborating centres within Australia and New Zealand. Stratification was by centre and multiple pregnancy (three groups - singleton, twin or higher order multiple). Women were randomly allocated to either intravenous magnesium sulphate (n = 535 women, 629 live babies) or an identical volume of saline placebo (n = 527 women, 626 live babies). The magnesium sulphate dose was 4 g over 20 minutes, followed by 1 g/hour for up to 24 hours or until birth, whichever came first. There were no repeat courses of treatment. The primary endpoints of the study were total paediatric mortality up to a corrected age of two years; cerebral palsy at two years' corrected age; and the combined adverse outcome of death or cerebral palsy at two year follow up.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Magpie-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Magpie 2006</LINK> (other intent - neuroprotection of the pre-eclamptic mother)</P>
<P>A total of 10,141 women who were either undelivered or within 24 hours of birth with pre-eclampsia and uncertainty about whether to use magnesium sulphate to prevent eclampsia were enrolled from July 1998 to November 2001 into the Magpie Trial - a randomised controlled trial of either magnesium sulphate or saline placebo. Women were excluded if they had hypersensitivity to magnesium, hepatic coma, or myasthenia gravis. The magnesium sulphate dose was 4 g intravenously over 10 to 15 minutes, followed by either 1 g/hour intravenously for 24 hours, or by 5 g every 4 hours intramuscularly for 24 hours. There were no repeat courses of treatment. The major endpoint of the study was neuroprotection of the mother (avoidance of eclampsia). Secondary endpoints included long-term outcome for the children. Unpublished outcome data were provided from the trial investigators on the 1544 women who were undelivered when treated with magnesium sulphate and who were less than 37 weeks' gestational age at randomisation, as well as for the subgroups less than 34 and less than 30 weeks' gestational age at randomisation, and for the subgroups of singleton pregnancies versus multiple pregnancies. Outcome data for women from the Magpie study were included if the child was selected for follow up and outcomes for the child were known, even if the only outcome available was death.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Marret-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Marret 2006</LINK> (neuroprotection)</P>
<P>A total of 573 women whose birth was planned or expected within 24 hours with singleton, twin or triplet less than 33 weeks' gestation were enrolled at 18 collaborating centres in France into the Premag Trial. Only data from 13 centres (564 women) were included in the final report; two of the 18 centres recruited no women and three centres enrolled fewer than five women and were excluded on the basis of a prespecified criterion for exclusion of centres. Women were not eligible when the fetus had severe malformations, chromosomal abnormalities or growth restriction, and with various maternal complications, such as pre-eclampsia, hypotension, cardiac arrhythmias, electrolyte anomalies, renal insufficiency. Women were randomly allocated to either intravenous magnesium sulphate 4 g or an equal volume of isotonic saline placebo over 30 minutes. There were no repeat courses of treatment. The major endpoint of the study was white matter injury to the infant diagnosed by cranial ultrasound.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Mittendorf-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Mittendorf 2002</LINK> (neuroprotection/other intent: tocolysis)</P>
<P>A total of 149 women in preterm labour 25 to 33 weeks' gestation were enrolled from October 1995 to January 1997 at a single US centre into the MAGNET Trial. Women were excluded if there was non-reassuring fetal assessment, or clinical features of infection or pre-eclampsia, or more than twin pregnancy. Stratification was by race (black versus other), gestational age (25 to 28 weeks and 28 to 33 weeks), and, several months into the trial, plurality (singleton versus twin). There were two treatment strategies dependent upon cervical dilatation at entry: those with active labour and cervical dilatation less than 5 cm were considered candidates for tocolysis with magnesium sulphate (the 'tocolytic' arm); they were randomly allocated to receive magnesium sulphate as a 4 g bolus followed by 2 to 3 g/hour maintenance (n = 46 women, 55 babies), or an alternative tocolytic (non-blinded) (n = 46 women, 51 babies). The remainder (with cervical dilatation greater than 4 cm) were considered for the 'neuroprotective' arm of the study and were randomly allocated to either a 4 g magnesium sulphate bolus (n = 29 women, 30 babies) or saline placebo (n = 28 women, 29 babies). In the 'neuroprotective' arm no further magnesium sulphate treatment occurred. For the purposes of this review, the Mittendorf study was considered as two separate trials.</P>

<P>A total of 2241 women were eligible (a singleton or twin pregnancy at least 24 weeks gestation but less than 32 weeks at high risk of spontaneous birth due to ruptured membranes at 22 to 31 weeks gestation, or advanced preterm labour with dilatation 4 to 8 cm and intact membranes; or if an indicated preterm birth was anticipated with 24 hours (e.g. due to fetal growth restriction) but not if birth was anticipated within 2 hours or if cervical dilatation exceeded 8 cm). Women were not eligible if membranes had ruptured prior to 22 weeks; the obstetrician was unwilling to intervene for fetal benefit; or there were major fetal anomalies or demise; presence of hypertension or pre-eclampsia; maternal contraindications to magnesium sulphate; or receipt of intravenous magnesium sulphate within the prior 12 hours.</P>
<P>There were 20 collaborating sites across the United States with recruitment in the BEAM Trial from December 1997 to May 2004.</P>
<P>Stratification was by centre, and, in twin pregnancies, gestational age below, or at, or above 28 weeks gestation. Women were "randomised in a double-blind fashion" to either intravenous magnesium sulphate (n = 1096 women, 1188 babies) or identical-appearing placebo (n = 1145 women, 1256 babies).</P>
<P>The magnesium sulphate dose was 6 g over 20 to 30 minutes, followed by a maintenance infusion of 2 g/hour. If delivery had not occurred after 12 hours and was no longer considered imminent, the infusion was discontinued and resumed when delivery threatened. If at least 6 hours had transpired, another loading dose was given. Retreatment was withheld if: pre-eclampsia/eclampsia developed; maternal or fetal condition deteriorated so re-treatment would be detrimental; or if the gestational age had reached 34 weeks.</P>
<P>The primary outcome was the composite of 1) stillbirth or infant death by one year of age, or 2) moderate or severe cerebral palsy as assessed at or beyond two years' corrected age.</P>

<P>Overall, the methodological quality of the trials was relatively good, with a low risk of bias. However, the quality was better, and the risk of bias lower, in some studies compared with others (<LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>; <LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Crowther-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Crowther 2003</LINK> - This was a blinded trial with randomisation performed centrally by non-clinical staff independent of the chief investigators, with random variation in block sizes of four, six or eight, and separately for singleton, twin, or higher order multiple births. Each study number was placed on a masked treatment pack. Packs were sent to individual hospitals ready for use. No one at individual study sites had access to the treatment code. Outcomes were given for all mothers and fetuses enrolled.</P>
<P>Follow-up component: surviving children were assessed at 24 months of age, corrected for prematurity, by paediatricians and psychologists at individual study sites who were blinded to treatment group allocation. Neurological outcomes included cerebral palsy (criteria included abnormalities of tone and motor dysfunction) and gross motor function assessed by the criteria of <LINK REF="REF-Palisano-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Palisano 1997</LINK>. Substantial gross motor dysfunction comprised children who were not walking independently at two years of corrected age. Other outcomes included blindness (bilateral vision worse than 6/60), deafness requiring hearing aids, and developmental delay (defined as an Mental Developmental Index (MDI) on the Bayley Scales of Infant Development less than 85 (less than -1 SD) (<LINK REF="REF-Bayley-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bayley 1993</LINK>)). Major neurological disability was defined as any of moderate or severe cerebral palsy, blindness, deafness or an MDI less than 70. The follow-up rate of survivors at two years was 99% (1047/1061).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Magpie-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Magpie 2006</LINK> - This was a blinded trial with randomisation performed centrally, independent of the clinical investigators, with balance for severity of pre-eclampsia, gestational age, undelivered or delivered, anticonvulsants prior to entry, multiple pregnancy, and country. Masked treatment packs were provided to individual hospitals ready for use. No one at individual study sites had access to the treatment code. Outcomes were given for 99.7% of mothers and 98.7% of fetuses enrolled.</P>
<P>Follow-up component: not all surviving children could be followed in this multinational trial for various logistical reasons. In the study overall, approximately 2/3 of surviving children were selected for follow up, and of these children outcomes were determined for 73% (n = 3283), including those who died. Children were assessed by a developmental screening questionnaire at 18 or more months of age, corrected for prematurity where appropriate, and those who failed were invited for a more formal developmental test - usually the Bayley Scales of Infant Development, either the first (<LINK REF="REF-Bayley-1969" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bayley 1969</LINK>) or the second edition (<LINK REF="REF-Bayley-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bayley 1993</LINK>), or alternative tests such as the Griffiths scales. In addition, 20% of screen negative children were also assessed formally. It was intended that children would be at least 18 months old, corrected for prematurity where appropriate, but in some instances children had data only at younger ages. Major neurological disability was defined as any of moderate or severe cerebral palsy, blindness, deafness or a MDI on the Bayley Scales less than 70. Children were not routinely examined by a paediatrician or neurologist for diagnoses such as cerebral palsy. Given the lack of formal assessment of all children it is probable that diagnoses such as developmental delay (defined as a MDI on the Bayley Scales less than 85 (less than -1 SD)), or cerebral palsy were underestimated. For this review, the Magpie investigators provided data for 1593 infants whose mothers were treated at less than 37 weeks' gestational age out of the total of 3283 children with follow-up data.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Marret-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Marret 2006</LINK> - This was a single-blind trial with randomisation performed centrally, with randomisation numbers generated by computer using variable block size from two to 16 depending on expected recruitment. Randomisation was independent of the clinical investigators, with balance for study centre, multiple pregnancy, and gestational age (less than 27 weeks, 27 to 29 weeks, 30 to 32 weeks). The major endpoint of the study was infant death or white matter injury detected by cranial ultrasound and defined as the presence of periventricular cavitation, intraparenchymal haemorrhage, persisting hyperechogenicity or ventricular dilatation.</P>
<P>Follow-up component: at two years of age. Physicians caring for the children or the study investigators, who were blinded to treatment allocation, obtained data either by clinical examination or telephone with a standardised questionnaire derived from Amiel-Tison's (<LINK REF="REF-Amiel_x002d_Tison-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Amiel-Tison 2004</LINK>) and the Denver Developmental Scale. Motor and cognitive developmental scales were scored, ranging from one (normal) to four (severely impaired). Mild cognitive dysfunction was considered present if the child pointed to an article or an animal without possibility of nomination and/or pointed to the different part of the body and/or tired of quickly and/or had no symbolic games and/or had an uncertain building in and/or use of single words; a moderate cognitive dysfunction was considered if there was no preference for a toy or any activity, if the child only removed, threw out and did not put the cubes or toys in the box, if language was gibberish without identified words, if they were unable to express wish by gesture or attitude; a severe cognitive dysfunction was considered if there was no activity or stereotyped activities, no pointing with finger, no following with eyes and production of stereotyped sounds.The follow-up rate of survivors was 98%.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Mittendorf-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Mittendorf 2002</LINK> - The method of randomisation was not described. The 'tocolytic' arm was unblinded, whereas the 'neuroprotective' arm was blinded. Outcomes were given for all mothers and babies enrolled.</P>
<P>Follow-up component: surviving children were assessed at 4, 8, 12 and 18 months of age, corrected for prematurity, in a special follow-up clinic. Cerebral palsy (criteria not described) was diagnosed or verified at 18 months, by a developmental paediatrician who was blind to treatment allocation. Other long-term outcomes were not described. The follow-up rate of survivors was not described.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Rouse-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Rouse 2008</LINK> - This was a blinded trial with group allocation made according to a computer-generated random sequence.

<P>Follow-up component: Surviving children were scheduled for follow-up visits at age 6,12 and 24 months of age corrected for prematurity.</P>
<P>At the one year examination it was considered possible to make a definitive determination that the child did not have cerebral palsy. Infants who had a normal neurological examination and could walk 10 steps independently and had a bilateral pincer grasp, were declared free of cerebral palsy and further assessment (at two years) for cerebral palsy was not made.</P>
<P>Neurological outcomes included cerebral palsy, diagnosed by criteria of delay in gross motor development milestones, abnormalities of muscle tone, motor dysfunction and abnormal reflexes (persistence of primitive or absence of protective reflexes). An annually certified paediatrician or paediatric neurologist made a diagnosis of cerebral palsy if two or more of the following three features were present: a delay of 30% or more in gross motor developmental milestones (e.g., inability to sit without arm support by 9.5 months or walk by 17 months of corrected age) (<LINK REF="REF-Capute-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Capute 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Blasco-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blasco 1994</LINK>), abnormality in muscle tone (e.g., scissoring), 4+ or absent deep-tendon reflexes, or movement abnormality (e.g., posturing or gait asymmetry); or persistence of primitive reflexes or absence of protective reflexes. The Gross Motor Function Classification Scale (<LINK REF="REF-Palisano-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Palisano 1997</LINK>) was used to assess severity when cerebral palsy was diagnosed. Level one defined mild cerebral palsy, Levels two and three defined moderate, and Levels four and five defined severe. Other outcomes included scores on the Bayley Scales of Infant Development II. The follow-up rate of surviving infants was 95% (2137/2255).</P>

While <LINK REF="STD-Crowther-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Crowther 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Magpie-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Magpie 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Marret-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Marret 2006</LINK>; and <LINK REF="STD-Rouse-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Rouse 2008</LINK> showed no significant mortality differences between magnesium and no magnesium groups, <LINK REF="STD-Mittendorf-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Mittendorf 2002</LINK> showed significantly more deaths in the magnesium group (10/85 versus 1/80). Eight of the 10 deaths in the magnesium group (and no deaths in the no magnesium group) occurred in the 'tocolytic' arms of <LINK REF="STD-Mittendorf-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Mittendorf 2002</LINK> compared with two deaths and one death respectively in the 'neuroprotective' arms of the trial.</P>
<P>There were sufficient data to permit subgroup analysis based on the primary intent for giving magnesium sulphate in the study, either specifically for neuroprotection of the infant (the neuroprotective intent subgroup) or for other intent subgroups of prevention of pre-eclampsia and tocolysis. The RR for the neuroprotective intent subgroup was 0.95; 95% CI 0.80 to 1.12; four trials; 4446 infants; for the other intent subgroup 'prevention of eclampsia' RR 1.11; 95% CI 0.93 to 1.31; one trial; 1593 infants; and the other intent subgroup 'tocolysis' RR 15.79; 95% CI 0.93 to 266.72; one trial; 106 infants. There was moderate heterogeneity overall (I² = 45%) between studies, largely due to the different results from the other intent subgroup 'tocolysis', from the tocolytic arm of <LINK REF="STD-Mittendorf-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Mittendorf 2002</LINK>.</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2009-09-23 08:31:23 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Sonja L  Henderson">
<P>In women who are at risk of preterm birth, the available evidence shows that giving antenatal magnesium sulphate therapy substantially improves their unborn baby's chance of survival, free of cerebral palsy. The five included randomised trials with 6145 infants show an absolute risk of 3.40% (104/3052) for babies exposed to antenatal magnesium sulphate therapy and 5% (154/3093) for babies unexposed, giving an absolute risk reduction of 1.60% in cerebral palsy. The number of women need to treat to benefit one baby is 63 (95% confidence interval 44 to 155), assuming an event rate of 5% in the no magnesium group.</P>
<P>The body of evidence available is largest where the indication for use of magnesium sulphate was for neuroprotection of the baby. The neuroprotective intent subgroup is the only one showing a statistical benefit overall in the reduction of cerebral palsy.</P>
<P>In keeping with the benefit seen on risk of cerebral palsy there is evidence from three trials now (<LINK REF="STD-Crowther-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Crowther 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Magpie-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Magpie 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rouse-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Rouse 2008</LINK>) of a neuroprotective benefit of antenatal magnesium sulphate therapy on the outcomes of substantial gross motor dysfunction. In the original trials this was a secondary outcome.</P>
<P>Overall, apart from cerebral palsy and substantial gross motor dysfunction there were no significant differences found in the risk of other neurological impairments (developmental delay or intellectual impairment, blindness, deafness) or major neurological disabilities.</P>
<P>There are limitations in this meta-analysis related to long-term neurological outcomes, in part because of methodological limitations of the included studies. Only two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Crowther-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Crowther 2003</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Rouse-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Rouse 2008</LINK>) were designed to assess long-term effects of magnesium sulphate as the primary outcome. Details of the diagnosis of cerebral palsy were unclear in the study of <LINK REF="STD-Mittendorf-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Mittendorf 2002</LINK>. In the studies with the outcome of cerebral palsy, children have been assessed early in childhood, usually at two years of age or earlier, when the diagnosis is not always certain (<LINK REF="REF-Stanley-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stanley 1992</LINK>). Reassessment of neurological outcomes later in childhood, at least into school age, in all studies is desirable. Children in the <LINK REF="STD-Crowther-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Crowther 2003</LINK> study are being reassessed at eight to nine years of age; results should be available in 2009.</P>
<P>The meta-analysis shows no difference in paediatric mortality (fetal and later deaths) between the magnesium or no magnesium treatment groups. This is reassuring given the earlier reported concern about higher paediatric mortality that led to the termination of the Mittendorf study. Substantial heterogeneity between the studies is still evident for deaths of live born infants largely due to the Mittendorf study (<LINK REF="STD-Mittendorf-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Mittendorf 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>Secondary outcomes were not significantly different between treatment groups, but these were not always reported and there were thus less data to examine for effects of magnesium sulphate on these alternative outcomes. As further data become available it is hoped that the effects, if any, of magnesium sulphate therapy on secondary outcomes will become clearer.</P>
<P>The expected higher rate of maternal side effects with magnesium sulphate was observed, but major maternal complications were rare and not significantly different between treatment groups. Different strategies to reduce maternal side effects during administration of magnesium sulphate therapy require evaluation.</P>
<P>Three trials (<LINK REF="STD-Crowther-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Crowther 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Magpie-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Magpie 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rouse-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Rouse 2008</LINK>) reported on need for cessation of maternal therapy. Significantly more women in the magnesium sulphate group had their therapy stopped compared with women in the placebo group (8.0% versus 2.4%, p &lt;0.0001). Further studies are required that assess strategies to reduce maternal side effects during administration of magnesium sulphate therapy.</P>
<P>In the prespecified subgroup analyses:</P>
<UL>
<LI>when the intent of giving the magnesium sulphate was for neuroprotection, the magnesium group, compared with placebo, showed a significant reduction in the risk of death or cerebral palsy in favour of the magnesium group (RR 0.85; 95% CI 0.74 to 0.98; four trials; 4446 infants) and a significant reduction in substantial gross motor dysfunction (RR 0.60; 95% CI 0.43 to 0.83; three trials; 4387 children).</LI>
<LI>for all five studies who recruited women at less than 34 weeks gestation there was a reduction in cerebral palsy (RR 0.69; 95% CI 0.54 to 0.88; five trials; 5357 infants).</LI>
<LI>for studies with any loading and any maintenance, there was a significant reduction in cerebral palsy, largely due to the results from <LINK REF="STD-Rouse-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Rouse 2008</LINK>.</LI>
<LI>for the one trial where retreatment was permitted <LINK REF="STD-Rouse-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Rouse 2008</LINK> cerebral palsy showed a significant reduction with magnesium.</LI>

<P>The five included trials show diversity in their inclusion and exclusion criteria; reasons women were at risk of preterm birth (preterm labour, preterm prelabour rupture of the membranes, preeclampsia), gestational ages when women were eligible; time of treatment prior to expected preterm birth; and drug treatment protocol (differences in loading dose given whether loading alone, or loading followed by maintenance, whether retreatment was permitted).</P>
<P>Differences in gestational age at birth between the magnesium and no magnesium groups are unlikely to explain the therapeutic benefits of antenatal magnesium sulphate.  In the three studies where neuroprotection of the fetus was the primary aim and where data were available, there were negligible differences in mean gestational age at delivery between the magnesium and no magnesium groups (<LINK REF="STD-Crowther-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Crowther 2003</LINK> mean difference two days; <LINK REF="STD-Marret-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Marret 2006</LINK> mean difference zero days; <LINK REF="STD-Rouse-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Rouse 2008</LINK> mean difference 0.1 weeks).  In the neuroprotective arm of the fourth trial (<LINK REF="STD-Mittendorf-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Mittendorf 2002</LINK>), the proportions delivering &lt;28 weeks&#8217; gestational age were 21% (6/28) in the magnesium group and 18% (5/28) in the no magnesium group.</P>
<P>To examine in a more powerful analysis whether antenatal magnesium sulphate treatment is more effective in our prespecified subgroups (of reasons for preterm birth, singleton or multiple pregnancy, gestational age prior to birth treatment given, dosage, maintenance, retreatment) individual patient data meta-analysis may be helpful (<LINK REF="REF-Stewart-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stewart 2002</LINK>). Support from the individual trialists to contribute their data will need to be gained.</P>
<P>Given the positive findings that antenatal magnesium sulphate reduces the risk of cerebral palsy, further studies are required to clarify how magnesium sulphate works, who should receive magnesium sulphate medication and how best the treatment should be given. Studies comparing the dose, timing of administration and whether maintenance magnesium therapy is required are needed and also whether the magnesium sulphate treatment should be repeated.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2008-11-06 14:14:18 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Given the beneficial effects of magnesium sulphate reducing the risk of cerebral palsy and on substantial gross motor dysfunction in early childhood, the children in any randomised controlled trial (RCT) should be reassessed later in childhood to determine the presence or absence of other potentially important neurological effects, particularly on motor or cognitive function.</P>
<P>Different strategies to reduce maternal side effects during administration of magnesium sulphate therapy require evaluation.</P>
<P>Studies comparing the dose, timing of administration and whether maintenance magnesium therapy is required are needed and whether the magnesium sulphate treatment should be repeated.</P>
<P>Clarification of who may benefit most may be assisted by individual patient meta-analysis of the data from the available trials.</P>
