<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2015-10-01 09:44:29 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>
<B>Review question</B>
</P>
<P>We wanted to assess the effects of constraint-induced movement therapy (CIMT) on ability to manage daily activities and on the recovery of movement in paralysed arms after a stroke.</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>After a stroke, people can suffer from paralysis of an arm, and, even if some movement control remains, use it less than the unaffected arm. The paralysis makes arm movements, such as reaching, grasping, and manipulating objects difficult. In turn, this causes many difficulties in activities of daily life, such as bathing, dressing, eating and using the toilet. During CIMT the unaffected arm is restrained so it cannot be used, which means the affected arm has to be used instead. The unaffected arm and hand are prevented from moving with a glove or a special arm rest. CIMT is supposed to be a useful tool for recovering the ability to perform everyday activities.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>We, a team of Cochrane researchers, searched widely through the medical literature and identified 42 relevant studies involving 1453 participants. The evidence is current to January 2015. The participants in these studies had some control of their affected arm and were generally able to open their affected hand by extending the wrist and fingers. CIMT treatments varied between studies in terms of the time for which the participants' unaffected arm was constrained each day, and the amount of active exercise that the affected arm was required to do. CIMT was compared mainly to active physiotherapy treatments, and sometimes to no treatment.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>The 42 studies assessed different aspects of recovery from stroke, and not all measured the same things. Eleven studies (with 344 participants) assessed the effect of CIMT on disability (the effective use of the arm in daily living) and found that the use of CIMT did not lead to improvement in ability to manage everyday activities such as bathing, dressing, eating, and toileting. Twenty-eight trials (with 858 participants) tested whether CIMT improved the ability to use the affected arm. CIMT appeared to be more effective at improving arm movement than active physiotherapy treatments or no treatment.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
</P>
<P>The quality of the evidence for each outcome is limited due to small numbers of study participants and poor reporting of study details. We considered the quality of the evidence to be low for disability and very low for the ability to use the affected arm.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2015-09-25 10:46:23 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>In people who have had a stroke, upper limb paresis affects many activities of daily life. Reducing disability is therefore a major aim of rehabilitative interventions. Despite preserving or recovering movement ability after stroke, sometimes people do not fully realise this ability in their everyday activities. Constraint-induced movement therapy (CIMT) is an approach to stroke rehabilitation that involves the forced use and massed practice of the affected arm by restraining the unaffected arm. This has been proposed as a useful tool for recovering abilities in everyday activities.</P>

<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2015-09-17 17:46:18 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>To assess the efficacy of CIMT, modified CIMT (mCIMT), or forced use (FU) for arm management in people with hemiparesis after stroke.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2015-09-25 10:46:28 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group trials register (last searched June 2015), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; <I>The Cochrane Library</I> Issue 1, 2015), MEDLINE (1966 to January 2015), EMBASE (1980 to January 2015), CINAHL (1982 to January 2015), and the Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro; January 2015).</P>

<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2015-09-25 10:46:30 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>Randomised control trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs comparing CIMT, mCIMT or FU with other rehabilitative techniques, or none.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2015-10-01 09:42:36 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>One author identified trials from the results of the electronic searches according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria, three review authors independently assessed methodological quality and risk of bias, and extracted data. The primary outcome was disability.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-09-30 06:05:58 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included 42 studies involving 1453 participants. The trials included participants who had some residual motor power of the paretic arm, the potential for further motor recovery and with limited pain or spasticity, but tended to use the limb little, if at all. The majority of studies were underpowered (median number of included participants was 29) and we cannot rule out small-trial bias. Eleven trials (344 participants) assessed disability immediately after the intervention, indicating a non-significant standard mean difference (SMD) 0.24 (95% confidence interval (CI) -0.05 to 0.52) favouring CIMT compared with conventional treatment. For the most frequently reported outcome, arm motor function (28 studies involving 858 participants), the SMD was 0.34 (95% CI 0.12 to 0.55) showing a significant effect (P value 0.004) in favour of CIMT. Three studies involving 125 participants explored disability after a few months of follow-up and found no significant difference, SMD -0.20 (95% CI -0.57 to 0.16) in favour of conventional treatment.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2015-09-25 10:46:52 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>CIMT is a multi-faceted intervention where restriction of the less affected limb is accompanied by increased exercise tailored to the person&#8217;s capacity. We found that CIMT was associated with limited improvements in motor impairment and motor function, but that these benefits did not convincingly reduce disability. This differs from the result of our previous meta-analysis where there was a suggestion that CIMT might be superior to traditional rehabilitation. Information about the long-term effects of CIMT is scarce. Further trials studying the relationship between participant characteristics and improved outcomes are required.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2015-09-25 10:48:10 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2015-09-25 10:47:56 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>Stroke is a health concern worldwide and one of the main causes of disability (<LINK REF="REF-Albert-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Albert 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2011</LINK>). In Europe, stroke costs around EUR 64.1 billion, and in the United Kingdom around GBP 8.9 billion per annum is spent on community care and rehabilitation of people after stroke (<LINK REF="REF-Gustavsson-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gustavsson 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Saka-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Saka 2009</LINK>). In fact, only 12% of people that experience a stroke are independent in basic activities of daily living (ADL) one week after stroke onset (<LINK REF="REF-Wade-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wade 1987</LINK>); in the long-term, up to 74% of them have to rely on assistance for basic ADLs like feeding, self-care, and mobility (<LINK REF="REF-Miller-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Miller 2010</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2015-09-25 10:48:04 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>To restore independence to stroke survivors and reduce the cost of therapy and care, a number of approaches are now being investigated in an attempt to increase the effectiveness of stroke rehabilitation techniques for the recovery of the upper extremity (<LINK REF="REF-Pollock-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pollock 2014</LINK>). The management of upper extremity in people with stroke can involve a number of different treatments, which include: bilateral arm training (<LINK REF="REF-McCombe-Waller-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">McCombe Waller 2008</LINK>), biofeedback (<LINK REF="REF-Crow-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Crow 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moreland-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moreland 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rathkolb-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rathkolb 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sathian-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sathian 2000</LINK>), brain stimulation (<LINK REF="REF-Dayan-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dayan 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kagan-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kagan 2012</LINK>), electrical stimulation/functional electrical stimulation (<LINK REF="REF-Pomeroy-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pomeroy 2006</LINK>), mental practice (<LINK REF="REF-Page-2005a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Page 2005a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Page-2007a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Page 2007a</LINK>), mirror therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Michielsen-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Michielsen 2010</LINK>), robot assistance (<LINK REF="REF-Hesse-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hesse 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lum-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lum 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Masiero-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Masiero 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mehrholz-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mehrholz 2012</LINK>), repetitive task training (<LINK REF="REF-French-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">French 2007</LINK>), virtual reality (<LINK REF="REF-Laver-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Laver 2011</LINK>), and constraint-induced movement therapy (CIMT; <LINK REF="REF-Miltner-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Miltner 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Page-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Page 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Page-2002a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Page 2002a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Taub-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Taub 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Taub-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Taub 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Taub-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Taub 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>CIMT, as described by the first authors (<LINK REF="REF-Miltner-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Miltner 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Taub-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Taub 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Taub-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Taub 1999</LINK>), is based on two fundamental principles.</P>
<UL>
<LI>Forced use of the affected arm by restraining the unaffected arm, with a sling or a hand splint, during dedicated exercise sections or usual ADLs (90% of waking hours).</LI>
<LI>Massed practice (several hours of exercise) of the affected arm through a shaping method, where shaping involves a commonly operant conditioning method in which a behavioural objective (in this case 'movement') is approached in small steps of progressively increasing difficulty. The participant is rewarded with enthusiastic approval for improvement, but never blamed or punished for failure.</LI>
</UL>
<P>The initial report of the use of CIMT proposed extensive and intensive training (six to eight hours per day; <LINK REF="REF-Miltner-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Miltner 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Taub-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Taub 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Taub-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Taub 1999</LINK>); over the years, though, others have developed different forms of constraint therapy, reducing the training during the period of restraint (<LINK REF="STD-Page-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Page 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Page-2002a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Page 2002a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Page-2002b" TYPE="STUDY">Page 2002b</LINK>), or concentrating only on the use of restraint (forced use), with no additional treatment of the affected arm (<LINK REF="REF-Burns-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burns 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ploughman-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Ploughman 2004</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2015-09-25 10:48:07 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>The rationale for CIMT is based on the theory of 'learning non-use' from experiments on monkeys. Researchers observed that after upper limb de-afferentation (interruption of nerves), monkeys did not use their affected limb even though their motor ability was nearly normal (<LINK REF="REF-Knapp-1963" TYPE="REFERENCE">Knapp 1963</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Taub-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Taub 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Taub-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Taub 1980</LINK>). This 'non-use' was an acquired behaviour learned during the spinal shock period and, as a consequence of its origin, could be reversed by behavioural measures such as, for example, constraint of the sound limb. Thus the learned 'non-use' theory predicts that people after stroke have, in fact, greater movement ability than they show in their everyday tasks. If this is correct, constraint of the unaffected arm would be a useful tool for realising this ability in everyday activities (<LINK REF="REF-Sterr-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sterr 2006</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2015-09-25 10:48:10 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>Over recent years, the neuroplasticity and cortical reorganisation of the central nervous system (CNS) has been observed and described in trials with people after stroke undergoing CIMT (<LINK REF="REF-Kim-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kim 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Levy-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Levy 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Liepert-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liepert 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Liepert-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liepert 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lin-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Lin 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ro-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ro 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schaechter-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schaechter 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Szaflarski-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Szaflarski 2006</LINK>). The preliminary findings suggest that the functional improvements produced by CIMT are accompanied by plastic brain reorganisation associating noticeable brain changes with functional improvements related to CIMT. Our initial review published in 2008 identified 19 studies, now several new studies have been published and an update of our review was necessary in order to define better the effect of constraining therapies on stroke recovery.</P>

<P>Two review authors (DC and VS) independently classified outcome measures in terms of the domain assessed (disability, arm motor function, perceived arm motor function, arm motor impairment, quality of life and dexterity). When a study presented more than one outcome measure for the same domain, we used the measure most frequently utilised across studies for the analysis.

The study on clinimetric properties of the MAL scale reports relatively stable internal consistency in a population of chronic stroke patients, a correlation with ARAT score at baseline (Spearman's rho was 0.63 for AoU and QoU), but considerable doubts remain about the longitudinal construct validity of the instrument, and the study does not recommend its use as a primary outcome measure in trials (<LINK REF="REF-Van-der-Lee-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van der Lee 2004</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Publication bias and small study effects</HEADING>
<P>Visual inspection of the funnel plot indicated that pooled data might have been influenced by publication bias (<LINK REF="FIG-04" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 4</LINK>). Slight asymmetry of the plot is possible, with few studies characterised by extreme statistically significant results, largely favouring CIMT. It is also possible that others studies are 'missing' from the opposite area, which is in favour of the control. Another possible reason for slight asymmetry could be related to the large number of small trials we identified. Their methodological components for random sequence generation, allocation concealment and double blinding might have been inadequate. The reporting of most studies was largely unsatisfactory, preventing us from making full judgements of methods. These potential methodological shortcomings can be associated with exaggerated estimates of benefits of treatment.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-10-01 10:02:32 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>This work updates the previous Cochrane review published in 2008 on the efficacy of CIMT, mCIMT and FU. The review now includes 42 trials with 1453 participants. All studies enrolled people who had compromised, but residual, ability of upper arm and hand, participants were able to extend the wrist and the metacarpophalangeal joints at least 10° and 20° respectively, or presented a Brunnstrom stage &gt; 3 and with limited pain or spasticity. Moreover, people with cognitive impairment were excluded.</P>
<P>Results of this review show a superiority of CIMT in comparison with other rehabilitation approaches on the recovery from motor impairment and motor function (secondary outcomes) but not in disability (primary outcome).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Effect of CIMT on disability</HEADING>
<P>Eleven trials with 344 participants measured disability and we included their results in the analysis.</P>
<P>The impact of CIMT on disability indicates a non-significant effect if compared with active rehabilitation approaches (SMD 0.24, 95% CI -0.05 to 0.52). Also, at the longest follow-up, no superiority of CIMT is documented and subgroup analyses do not show interactions between disability and amount of task practice, anatomical region restraint or time since stroke. The main active rehabilitation approaches used by the control groups consisted of occupational therapy and techniques of adaptation to motor impairment (<LINK REF="STD-Dahl-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Dahl 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dromerick-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Dromerick 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lin-2009a" TYPE="STUDY">Lin 2009a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Myint-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Myint 2008</LINK>), functional task practice (<LINK REF="STD-Lin-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Lin 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ploughman-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Ploughman 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Treger-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Treger 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wu-2007a" TYPE="STUDY">Wu 2007a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wu-2007c" TYPE="STUDY">Wu 2007c</LINK>), Bobath principles (<LINK REF="STD-Huseyinsinoglu-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Huseyinsinoglu 2012</LINK>), and unspecified conventional rehabilitation (<LINK REF="STD-Yoon-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Yoon 2014</LINK>). The treatment duration was well balanced among studies except in that of <LINK REF="STD-Huseyinsinoglu-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Huseyinsinoglu 2012</LINK>, in which CIMT treatment lasted three times as long as the treatment performed by the control group, and in the <LINK REF="STD-Yoon-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Yoon 2014</LINK> study, in which there was a similar four-fold imbalance between the groups.</P>
<P>In summary, these studies showed that the use of constraining approaches (CIMT, mCIMT and FU) compared with a similar dose of rehabilitation targeting the practice of functional tasks did not result in a demonstrable improvement in disability.</P>

<P>Twenty-eight studies with a total of 848 participants measured arm motor function and we included them in the analysis. CIMT was always compared with active rehabilitation approaches, and showed a limited effect in improving arm motor function.</P>
<P>The majority of trials used a mCIMT, eight studies used CIMT (<LINK REF="STD-Dahl-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Dahl 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hayner-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Hayner 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Khan-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Khan 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Myint-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Myint 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Taub-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Taub 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wittenberg-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Wittenberg 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wolf-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Wolf 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yoon-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Yoon 2014</LINK>), and only three studies used FU (<LINK REF="STD-Hammer-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Hammer 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kim-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Kim 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ploughman-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Ploughman 2004</LINK>). Comparison groups performed the same dose of treatment with the exception of five studies in which the control groups' dose was lower (<LINK REF="STD-Dromerick-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Dromerick 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Taub-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Taub 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wittenberg-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Wittenberg 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wolf-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Wolf 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yoon-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Yoon 2014</LINK>), one study in which the dose was smaller in the treatment group (<LINK REF="STD-Huseyinsinoglu-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Huseyinsinoglu 2012</LINK>), and two studies in which it was not clearly specified (<LINK REF="STD-Dahl-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Dahl 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kim-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Kim 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>Twenty-three and 24 of the included studies with a total of 851 and 891 participants, respectively, measured the perceived arm motor function (AoU and QoU, respectively) and we included them in the analysis. In three studies the control groups did not perform treatments (<LINK REF="STD-Kim-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Kim 2008</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Taub-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Taub 1993</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Wittenberg-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Wittenberg 2003</LINK>).

<P>Sixteen of the included studies with a total of 372 participants measured arm motor impairment and we included them in the analysis. In one study the control group did not perform treatments (<LINK REF="STD-Kim-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Kim 2008</LINK>). The estimated effect of CIMT was considered to be large in modifying the arm motor impairment of the affected arm.</P>
<P>Four of the included studies with a total of 113 participants measured dexterity and we included them in the analysis. The estimated effect of CIMT led to a significant small effect in improving upper limb dexterity.</P>
<P>CIMT does not appear to have a better effect than other rehabilitation approaches in improving quality of life; this was measured in three studies.</P>
<P>It is worth noting the considerable heterogeneity of the studies included in the review, regarding the way in which CIMT was applied and the characteristics of the control treatments. Considering this heterogeneity, and some differences among the outcome measures used by the authors, the results of these analyses should be interpreted with caution.</P>
<P>When reported, rates of adverse events among included studies do not appear to differ between CIMT and the comparison groups, and CIMT appears to have no adverse effects.</P>
<P>Sixteen studies declared dropout levels of 4% to 23%, including losses for non-medical reasons, with the exception of one study in which four of the 13 participants in the experimental group did not complete the programme due to difficulties in performing the ADLs (<LINK REF="STD-Kim-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Kim 2008</LINK>).</P>

</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2015-09-25 10:51:30 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>In 2009 this review concluded that "the impact of CIMT on disability indicated a modest significant benefit". With the increase in the number of included studies, the effect of CIMT on disability decreased and became non-significant (SMD 0.24, 95% CI -0.05 to 0.52; <LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>). We classified the magnitude of effect sizes as proposed by <LINK REF="REF-Juni-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Juni 2006</LINK>. The effect size of 0.24 standard deviation units obtained for disability is considered small. It corresponds to an overlap in the distribution of participants allocated in the experimental or control interventions of about 85% of cases, indicating that only 15% of people would benefit from CIMT treatment after stroke. Also, the sample sizes of the 42 included studies were generally small.</P>
<P>It has been argued that only individuals presenting with mild to moderate paresis of the upper limb (<LINK REF="REF-Nijland-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nijland 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Smania-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smania 2007</LINK>), as well as those who are more motivated, would be eligible for CIMT treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Wissink-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wissink 2014</LINK>). Actually, from reports of included trials there is a clear difficulty in finding eligible participants. Sixty-one per cent for <LINK REF="STD-Lin-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Lin 2010</LINK>, and 93% for <LINK REF="STD-Smania-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Smania 2012</LINK>, of people assessed for eligibility were excluded because they did not fit the inclusion criteria. Moreover, about 20% of eligible people refused to participate in the study. This means that only a small number of the people who were screened were included in these eligible trials. Moreover, the presence of movement requested as part of the inclusion criteria could have allowed for selection of those people with less severe stroke. Transcranial magnetic stimulation and diffusion tensor imaging studies show that voluntary wrist and finger extension are associated with the integrity of the corticospinal tract system (<LINK REF="REF-Butler-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Butler 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stinear-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stinear 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stinear-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stinear 2010</LINK>). Consequently, the characteristics of people to include in these trials raise questions about the application of this intervention in a wide range of stroke survivors.</P>
<P>The included studies were heterogeneous in participant and intervention characteristics for both CIMT and the control group. However, none of the subgroup analyses performed in this review (dose of treatment, time since stroke, anatomical region restraint) revealed a group of better responders. Although no evidence exists that the dose of CIMT influences the results, it does not imply that it is not important. Consequently, it is not possible to exclude the possibility that the high dose of CIMT reported in the <LINK REF="STD-Yoon-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Yoon 2014</LINK> study introduced heterogeneity in the analysis, thus providing overestimation of the effect of CIMT on disability. Finally, the results of this meta-analysis do not show that the first weeks after stroke onset are the most important for the application of CIMT, as studies on neuroplasticity might suggest (<LINK REF="REF-Sunderland-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sunderland 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>Improvements introduced by CIMT are mainly based on learning to optimise the use of end-effectors through compensatory strategies. The effects documented in this meta-analysis involve motor impairment and motor function without a translation in disability. This could be considered as surprising, as the rationale for CIMT is based on decreasing the learned non-use phenomenon, however, it could be due to the characteristics of the measures of disability.</P>
<P>The number of RCTs and the data that inform this review have increased over the past few years. However, the included studies were generally poor in terms of relevance of findings and quality of reporting. Only 11 out of 42 studies (with 344 participants) reported data on the most relevant clinical outcome &#8211; disability &#8211; comparing CIMT with an active control intervention. Reporting was often incomplete, which made some studies uninformative.</P>
<P>The applicability of cumulative evidence characterised by a large number of small trials of uncertain quality challenges definitive conclusions about the role of CIMT; however, the findings of this review suggest that CIMT does not show relevant benefits for the outcomes that may matter most to people after their stroke.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2015-09-25 10:51:34 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>Three-quarters of the included trials can be considered to be at unclear risk of bias (see <LINK TAG="STUDY_QUALITY" TYPE="SECTION">Risk of bias in included studies</LINK>) for at least one key bias area. In fact, key methodological information was often not reported for sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding, and missing data. Blinding of study personnel, particularly outcome assessors, was reported in the majority of studies.</P>
<P>Many trials were likely to be underpowered, likely to approach analyses on a per protocol basis, and had a strong inclination to perform multiple testing on function scales.</P>
<P>Recent meta-reporting studies showed promising improvements in the reporting of rehabilitation trials (<LINK REF="REF-Abdul-Latif-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Abdul Latif 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Villamar-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Villamar 2013</LINK>), and reviews (<LINK REF="REF-DiSilvestro-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">DiSilvestro 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gianola-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gianola 2013</LINK>). In the cohort of trials that have evaluated the effectiveness of CIMT, there were a few recent trials that adopted robust methods and accurate reporting of clinical and methodological aspects (<LINK REF="STD-Brunner-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Brunner 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Smania-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Smania 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Treger-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Treger 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wolf-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Wolf 2006</LINK>). These trials represent the next generation in terms of methodological issues, and a major step forward in research to understand fully the benefit and safety of rehabilitation techniques in comparative studies.</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2015-09-27 22:14:37 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We chose disability as the primary outcome, although it was considered by a minority of eligible studies (11 studies with a total of 344 participants), whereas arm motor function was used as the primary outcome in the majority of included studies (28 studies with 858 participants).</P>
<P>Although the analysis showed the largest effect of CIMT on perceived arm motor function, caution is needed in interpreting this result, because of the lack of consistency in the MAL scale, as described in the <LINK TAG="STUDY_QUALITY" TYPE="SECTION">Risk of bias in included studies</LINK> section. Its clinimetric properties need further investigation in order to define its use in longitudinal studies.</P>
<P>Most trials were small, with some trials enrolling only six or 10 participants. This is unacceptable, given the high incidence of stroke and the opportunity to recruit a large sample. Our sample of trials may therefore have been influenced by publication bias, which tends to exaggerate the effect of treatment. The randomisation methods were described only in about half of the included trials. It is not possible to determine if some studies excluded participants after randomisation, or whether blinding was not adequately maintained. These weaknesses could be expected to lead to bias in favour of a treatment effect. The reporting of the data was poor; for example, many trials only reported that there were no significant differences between the intervention and the control groups. This lack of proper reporting could also be expected to lead to bias in favour of a treatment effect. It should also be noted that many authors of trials have a cultural and professional interest in disseminating positive results about the rehabilitative techniques they propose.</P>
<P>Finally, only one author of the review scanned the titles obtained from electronic databases searching in order to exclude irrelevant studies and this could have introduced bias.</P>

<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2015-10-01 09:38:22 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2015-09-25 10:51:41 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>Compared with traditional rehabilitation, constraint-induced movement therapy (CIMT) is associated with limited improvements in motor impairment and motor function, but these benefits do not convincingly reduce disability. These results differ from our previous meta-analysis, which suggested a possible improvement in disability with CIMT. The recent studies included in this review did not confirm these findings, and data about the long-term effects of CIMT are limited.</P>
<P>CIMT can be considered a multifaceted intervention where the restriction of the less affected limb is accompanied by an increase in the amount and quality of exercise for the affected limb. The impact on arm impairment and motor function may not be due solely to the constraint, but also to the type and amount of exercise. However, this review could not identify which of these factors is more important.</P>
<P>The selection of participants for the included studies focused on people with stroke who had at least some active extension of the wrist and fingers, with limited pain or spasticity, plus good compliance with rehabilitation treatment. It appears that the review results apply most appropriately to this patient group. Many studies were underpowered with a high risk of small trial bias and publication bias. It is not clear if the apparent benefits on motor impairment and motor function can be translated into improvements in activities of daily living. Moreover, it is not possible to comment on the long-term effects of CIMT.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2015-10-01 09:38:22 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>It is likely that additional randomised controlled trials (RCTs) investigating CIMT as a rehabilitation technique would be worthwhile if they:</P>
<UL>
<LI>involve a control group under active treatment, since CIMT involves a certain amount of exercise;</LI>
<LI>consider disability or arm motor function as the primary outcomes;</LI>
<LI>include a validated quality of life measure as one of the outcomes; and</LI>
<LI>determine and report the sample size and power analysis transparently.</LI>
</UL>
<P>CIMT trials do not make it clear which people might most benefit from this treatment. Participants in the RCTs were those with at least some active extension of wrist and fingers and with limited pain or spasticity. Researchers involved in future studies should analyse the correlation between participant characteristics and outcome improvements in order to identify responders to CIMT. Clinicians who aspire to offer their patients a tailored programme of CIMT need to examine individual characteristics carefully to identify potential factors that are likely to increase the limited chance of success of CIMT.</P>

<P>In 2003, based on the-then existing evidence about CIMT, the protocol for this review was published in <I>The Cochrane Library</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Sirtori-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sirtori 2003</LINK>); subsequently, the same authors found that the protocol did not reflect the increasing variability among potentially relevant primary studies and the review was out of date in terms of systematic review methodology. The main shortcomings in the protocol related to:</P>
<UL>
<LI>the inclusion criteria in terms of participants, interventions and outcome measures, as they were too restrictive and narrowly focused, being de facto a subgroup analysis (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). Outcome measures added during the systematic review process were not present in the original protocol of this review. These items were perceived as being of importance for physiotherapists and people with stroke, and offer a more complete picture about the efficacy of this technique;</LI>
<LI>the Methods section, which did not provide enough detail to ensure replicability.</LI>
</UL>
<P>We have now revised these sections extensively, with the following main amendments.</P>
<UL>
<LI>Background: to reflect what is known in 2015.</LI>
<LI>Objectives: to include studies investigating not only CIMT but also modified CIMT (mCIMT) and Forced Use (FU) therapy, which are closely related and belong to one specific class of intervention.</LI>
<LI>Types of interventions: to include interventions that differ widely in duration and intensity.</LI>
<LI>Types of outcome measures: new secondary outcomes were added in order to offer physiotherapists and people with stroke a more complete picture of the efficacy of this technique.</LI>
<LI>Methods of the review: to provide enough detail to allow repetition of the review by other researchers.</LI>
</UL>
<P>We considered these legitimate reasons to modify the original protocol.</P>

<BR/>Comment: (Singh 2013) is assessed by the authors as being at low risk of bias in the "performance bias and detection bias" domain. The support for this judgement is [Quote: "the rater ... was not blinded to the study"]. This is not coherent with the assessment of the authors, as their methods explicitly say that studies with no blinding will be scored as high risk. The full quote from Singh is : "There are few limitations of our study like: Small sample size due to limited stroke subjects, the rater who was not blinded to the study.".<BR/>

<P>Dear Martin Vuillème</P>
<P>Thank you for reporting back to us the incoherent evaluation of the risk of bias of the study by Singh et al (1) in the text of our review. The judgment of the "Performance bias and detection bias" domain in the Risk of bias table for this study has been corrected to "high risk". The text of the review on risk of bias has also been corrected.</P>
<P>The overall quality of evidence or the conclusions of the review have not changed (2).</P>
<P>Best regards,</P>
