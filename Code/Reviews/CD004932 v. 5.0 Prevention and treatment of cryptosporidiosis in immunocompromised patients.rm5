<SUMMARY>
<TITLE>Not enough evidence on effectiveness of drugs or preventive measures on disease caused by <I>Cryptosporidium</I>.</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Cryptosporidiosis is a disease that causes diarrhoea, and can be life-threatening in individuals whose bodies are not able to resist infections. It causes disease in the both the developed and the developing world. This review of trials found insufficient evidence to say whether any drug is able to reduce or cure the symptoms of <I>Cryptosporidium</I> infection or to effectively kill the organism among individuals who cannot resist infections. A limited amount of evidence was found indicating that the drug nitaxozanide can kill the organism in individuals with a normal immunity.</P>
</SUMMARY_BODY>
</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Cryptosporidiosis is a disease that causes diarrhoea lasting about one to two weeks, sometimes extending up to 2.5 months among the immunocompentent and becoming a more severe life-threatening illness among immunocompromised individuals. <I>Cryptosporidium</I> is a common cause of gastroenteritis. Cryptosporidiosis is common in HIV-infected individuals.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>The objective of the review was to assess the efficacy of interventions for the treatment and prevention of cryptosporidiosis among immunocompromised individuals.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>We searched the following databases for randomised controlled trials up to August 2005: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, AIDSLINE, AIDSearch, EMBASE, CINAHL, Current Contents, Geobase, and the Environmental Sciences and Pollution Management.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomised controlled trials that compared the use of any intervention to treat or prevent cryptosporidiosis in immunocompromised persons were included. The outcome measures for treatment studies included symptomatic diarrhoea and oocyst clearance.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Two reviewers independently assessed the trials for quality of randomisation, blinding, withdrawals, and adequacy of allocation concealment. The relative risk for each intervention was calculated using a random effects model.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Seven trials involving 169 participants were included. There were 130 adults with AIDS enrolled in five studies. Evidence of significant heterogeneity was present. There was no evidence for a reduction in the duration or frequency of diarrhoea by nitazoxanide (RR 0.83 (95% CI 0.36-1.94)) and paramomycin (RR 0.74 (95% CI 0.42-1.31)) compared with placebo. Nitazoxanide led to a significant evidence of oocyst clearance compared with placebo among all children with a relative risk of 0.52 (95% CI 0.30-0.91). The effect was not significant for HIV-seropositive participants (RR 0.71 (95% CI 0.36-1.37)). HIV-seronegative participants on nitazoxanide had a significantly higher relative risk of achieving parasitological clearance of 0.26 (95% CI 0.09-0.80) based on a single study. The single study comparing spiramycin with placebo found no significant difference in reduction of the duration of hospitalisation (mean difference -0.40 days (95% CI -6.62-5.82)) or in mortality between the two arms of the trial (RR 0.43 (95% CI 0.04-4.35)). One study assessed the role of bovine dialyzable leukocyte extract, reporting a relative risk for decreased stool frequency of 0.19 (95% CI 0.03-1.19), while another compared bovine hyperimmune colostrum with placebo and found no evidence for improvement of stool volume (RR 3.00 (95% CI 0.61-14.86)) or in oocyst concentration per ml of stool (RR 0.27 (95% CI 0.02-3.74)). No studies were found that assessed prevention.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>This review confirms the absence of evidence for effective agents in the management of cryptosporidiosis. The results indicate that nitaxozanide reduces the load of parasites and may be useful in immunocompetent individuals. Due to the seriousness of the potential outcomes of cryptosporidiosis, the use of nitaxozanide should be considered in immunocompromised patients. The absence of effective therapy highlights the need to ensure that infection is avoided. Unfortunately, evidence for the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of preventive interventions is also lacking.</P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
</ABSTRACT>
<BODY MODIFIED="2012-04-12 11:06:32 -0700" MODIFIED_BY="Tara Horvath">
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Cryptosporidiosis is a disease caused by a coccidial parasite of the genus Cryptosporidium. <I>Cryptosporidium hominis</I>, formally <I>Cryptosporidium parvum</I> genotype 1(<LINK REF="REF-Morgan_x002d_Ryan-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morgan-Ryan 2002</LINK>) and <I>C. parvum,</I> are the most frequent cause of human infection. Cryptosporidiosis affects immunocompetent (particularly children under the age of five years) and immunocompromised individuals worldwide, especially HIV-infected individuals. It causes diarrhoea lasting about one to two weeks, sometimes extending up to 2.5 months among the immunocompentent and resulting in a more severe life-threatening illness among immunocompromised individuals (<LINK REF="REF-Hunter-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hunter 2002</LINK>). The World Health Organisation's guideline for drinking water classifies <I>Cryptosporidium</I> as a pathogen of significant public health importance, aided in part by the organisms low infective dose and its resistance to conventional water treatment, such as chlorination (<LINK REF="REF-Havelaar-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Havelaar 2003</LINK>). </P>
<P>
<I>Cryptosporidium</I> has been responsible for major outbreaks, (MacKenzie 1994; <LINK REF="REF-Cicirello-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cicirello 1997</LINK>) as well as sporadic cases of gastroenteritis in the developed world (<LINK REF="REF-McLauchlin-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">McLauchlin 2000</LINK>). <I>Cryptosporidium</I> is also widespread in the developing world, with 10-30% of individuals being asymptomatic cyst excretors (<LINK REF="REF-Current-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Current 1991</LINK>). Cryptosporidiosis is common in HIV-infected individuals.</P>
<P>Treatment of underlying immunosuppression with antiretrovirals has been found to reduce the severity of cryptosporidiosis in HIV-positive persons (<LINK REF="REF-Carr-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carr 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Maggi-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maggi 2000</LINK>), but does not result in a parasitological cure. Immunocompromised persons who are not HIV-infected do not have the option of using antiretrovirals. Effective treatment for cryptosporidiosis will be useful as an adjunct to antiretroviral therapy, as well as in settings where antiretrovirals are either too expensive or not availableSYMBOL 190 \f "Symbol" \s 9for example, for malnourished children in the developing world. Also, if effective treatments were available, cancer and post-transplant patients would not be required to interrupt immunosuppression in order to control cryptosporidiosis.</P>
<P>Several antimicrobials have been proposed for the treatment of cryptosporidiosis among the immunocompromised. Evidence from clinical trials has shown that some of the antimicrobials ameliorate the disease. Several drugs have been tested in clinical trials, including nitazoxanide, paromomycin, rifabutin, and several macrolides (azithromycin, clarithromycin, and spiramycin). In a review of current and potential therapeutic agents available for the treatment of cryptosporidiosis among immunocompromised persons, Mead suggested the need to explore newer agents, because effective drugs to eradicate <I>Cryptosporidium</I> are lacking (<LINK REF="REF-Mead-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mead 2002</LINK>). The evidence summarised showed limited effectiveness in clinical trials with macrolides (azithromycin and clarithromycin), paromomycin, and nitazoxamide. The reviewed trials showed that statistically there were no significant effects for other agents, such as spiramycin, diclazuril, and letrazuril, and only mixed results with immunotherapy using agents such as hyperimmune bovine colostrums. A variety of approaches to using passive antibody immunotherapy were found to have some degree of efficacy, though the responses have been, for the most part, partial rather than complete resolution of disease (<LINK REF="REF-Crabb-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Crabb 1998</LINK>). There is very little evidence for preventive measures for cryptosporidiosis among immunocompromised individuals. Most guidelines are based on expert opinion and observational studies (<LINK REF="REF-CDC-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">CDC 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Juranek-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Juranek 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Okhuysen-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Okhuysen 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hunter-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hunter 2000</LINK>). A variety of measures can be used to either reduce exposure to <I>Cryptosporidium</I> or to increase the individuals' resistance to infection. Possible measures include boiling drinking water for over a minute, point of use filter, and the use of hyperimmune bovine colostrums as a prophylactic agent (<LINK REF="STD-Greenberg-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Greenberg 1996</LINK>). Bovine antibodies and hyperimmune bovine colostrums have also shown encouraging results (<LINK REF="STD-McMeeking-1990" TYPE="STUDY">McMeeking 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nord-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Nord 1990</LINK>). </P>
<P>The management of <I>Cryptosporidium</I> infection is likely to vary between the developed world and the developing world, as drug interventions may not be readily available, especially in developing countries, within the first few years of marketing. It is unlikely that the effectiveness of the drugs will vary in the two different settings for individuals with similar nutritional and immunity status. Prevention will be more relevant to a developing country situation, but effective measures identified in one setting may apply to both.</P>
<P>AIMS OF TREATMENT<BR/>Cryptosporidiosis is self-limiting in the immunocompetent but not in the immunocompromised patient, where it can be life threatening. The aim of treatment is to reduce the duration of diarrhoea, prevent complications, eliminate the organism from the host, and reduce mortality. </P>
<P>Aim of prevention <BR/>The primary aim of prevention is to reduce the number of new cases of cryptosporidiosis.</P>

<SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<CRIT_STUDIES>
<P>All published or unpublished randomised controlled trials (RCT) where a specified agent (antimicrobial or antibodies) was compared with placebo or no treatment in patients with cryptosporidiosis. RCTs of interventionsSYMBOL 190 \f "Symbol" \s 9use of filters, boiling water, other water treatment, or drugs for the prevention of infection were considered.</P>
</CRIT_STUDIES>
<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>The types of participants included immunocompromised adults and children with proven cryptosporidiosis for treatment, and those without evidence of infection for prevention trials. Immunocompromised persons for the purpose of this review included the following three categories: 1) HIV-infected individuals (with or without AIDS), 2) malnourished children, and 3) individuals on immunosuppressive therapy. Subgroup analysis was planned where appropriate to explore the effect of interventions in each group. We planned to split the data based on developing or developed country status.</P>
</CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>In the intervention group, we considered specific, identified trials that utilised antibiotics or antibodies to treat persons with diagnosed cryptosporidiosis. The antibiotics and antibodies included the following:<BR/>·Paromomycin<BR/>·Nitazoxanide<BR/>·Macrolides: azithromycin, clarithromycin, or spiramycin<BR/>·Rifabutin, rifaximin<BR/>·Bovine immunoglobulin.</P>

<SEARCH_METHODS>
<P>Please refer to the HIV/AIDS Group search strategy.</P>
<P>We utilised a search strategy that combines a highly sensitive filter for randomized controlled trials and subject specific terms. Although the protocol included terms to limit the search to specific drugs/preventive interventions, this review has not used this limitation to enhance the ability to detect all relevant studies. We did not have any language or publication status restrictions. </P>
<P>We used the following terms to search for eligible randomised controlled trials or review articles: subject terms (Cryptosporidiosis) OR (<I>Cryptosporidium</I>) OR (<I>Cryptosporidium parvum</I>) AND the revised optimised search strategy for trials (<LINK REF="REF-Robinson-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Robinson 2002</LINK>) using the OVID interface. </P>
<P>Other search terms used for prevention trials include Prevention [MeSH] OR Water Purification [MeSH] OR Biofilter[MeSH] OR Water Quality [MeSH] OR Water Supply [MeSH] "OR" the following non MESH terms: boiling water OR water-treatment devices OR filters AND the subject terms outlined above.</P>

<P>Study eligibility and application of inclusion and exclusion criteria</P>
<P>Using the above search strategy, two reviewers independently reviewed all identified titles and abstracts. If the title and/or abstract was felt to be relevant by either reviewer, the full text of the article was reviewed. From the full text, and using specific criteria, we independently selected trials for inclusion. We measured agreement using the kappa statistic and resolved disagreement by consensus. All randomised controlled trials of interventions (drug treatment or preventive measures) identified using the search strategy outlined above and meeting the set criteria were included.</P>
<P>Data extraction<BR/>Two reviewers independently extracted data in a standard form. Disagreements were resolved by consensus. Trials that satisfied the inclusion criteria were reviewed and the following information recorded: study setting, year of study, participant characteristics (age and cause of immunosuppression), intervention and control given, co-intervention (such as use of antiretrovirals), duration of diarrhoea, location, outcome measures, whether the study was conducted in a developed or developing country, and the source of funding for the study. Other characteristics recorded included publication details, allocation concealment, blinding after allocation, generation of allocation sequence, the inclusion of all randomised participants, and loss to follow-up (intention to treat analysis).</P>
<P>Assessment of methodological quality</P>
<P>The quality of the included studies was independently assessed. The following quality criteria were assessed:<BR/>·Allocation concealment, in which trials were scored with the following grades: Grade A: adequate concealment; Grade B: unclear; Grade C: clearly inadequate concealment.<BR/>·The Jadad Scale (<LINK REF="REF-Jadad-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jadad 1996</LINK>) was used to assess the methodological quality of the included studies. This scale scores three dimensions of study quality: randomisation, blinding, and study withdrawals. The maximum possible score is five. See <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>.</P>
<P>The scale is as follows:<BR/>·Was the study described as randomised (this includes words such as randomly, random, and randomisation)? 0/1<BR/>·Was the method used to generate the sequence of randomisation described and appropriate (table of random numbers, computer-generated, etc)? 0/1<BR/>·Was the study described as double blind? 0/1<BR/>·Was the method of double blinding described and appropriate (identical placebo, active placebo, dummy, etc)? 0/1<BR/>·Was there a description of withdrawals and dropouts? 0/1<BR/>·Deduct one point if the method used to generate the sequence of randomisation was described and it was inappropriate (e.g., participants were allocated alternately, or according to date of birth, hospital number, etc). 0/-1<BR/>·Deduct one point if the study was described as double blind but the method of blinding was inappropriate (e.g., comparison of tablet vs. injection with no double dummy). 0/-1</P>
<P>Conflicts in coding were resolved by discussion.</P>
<P>Statistical analysis</P>
<P>A meta-analysis was performed to generate summary point estimates and corresponding confidence intervals for the relevant outcomes. Evidence for statistical heterogeneity of results was assessed using Cochrane Q Chi square test and I squared statistic. A significance level of less than 0.10 and I squared greater than 50% was interpreted as evidence of heterogeneity. If significant heterogeneity was found, the results from the random effects model were emphasised and the relevant factors explored in subgroup analysis where data is available. Analyses were performed with Cochrane's Review Manager (Version 4.2.8).</P>
<P>We planned to conduct subgroup analysis of HIV status in developing or developed country studies, but there was insufficient data to carry these out. We planned sensitivity analysis by removing lower-quality studies, but due to the absence significant results, this plan was not carried out. The potential for publication bias will be assessed by visually examining funnel plots for evidence of asymmetry.</P>

<RESULTS>
<STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<P>The initial search identified 1503 potentially relevant titles. After reviewing the titles and abstracts, 21 papers in full text were obtained for consideration of inclusion into the review. Fourteen papers were excluded. Details are provided in the table "Characteristics of excluded studies." The main reasons for exclusion were the non-randomised nature of the studies (;<LINK REF="STD-Saez_x002d_Llorens-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Saez-Llorens 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Flanigan-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Flanigan 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dionisio-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Dionisio 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Smith-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sprinz-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Sprinz 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Uip-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Uip 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Amenta-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Amenta 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fichtenbaum-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Fichtenbaum 2000</LINK>), the use of healthy, immunocompetent adults or children (<LINK REF="STD-Woolf-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Woolf 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Okhuysen-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Okhuysen 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hellard-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Hellard 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rossignol-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Rossignol 2001</LINK>) single patient trial (<LINK REF="STD-Greenberg-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Greenberg 1996</LINK>), or the lack of adequate placebo or comparator (<LINK REF="STD-Kadappu-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Kadappu 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>The review identified seven studies. All identified studies were "treatment" studies; there were no "prevention" studies. The details are provided in the table "Characteristics of included studies." </P>
<P>Participants</P>
<P>Studies that considered treatments for cryptosporidiosis were based on immunocompromised participants randomised to either antibiotics or antibodies. Of the seven treatment studies, two (<LINK REF="STD-Amadi-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Amadi 2002</LINK>) and (<LINK REF="STD-Wittenberg-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Wittenberg 1989</LINK>) involved children. Amadi's nitazoxanide study involved 100 malnourished children (age range 12-85 months), including 50 HIV-positive children and 50 children who were HIV negative. Wittenberg tested the effectiveness of spiramycin on 39 malnourished paediatric participants whose ages ranged from 5.8 +/- 3.9 months in the treatment group, and 6.3+/- 5.2 months in the placebo group. Although the children were described as being malnourished in both studies, only Amadi defined malnutrition status as being severely, moderate, or mildly underweight. The remaining five treatment studies (<LINK REF="STD-Nord-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Nord 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McMeeking-1990" TYPE="STUDY">McMeeking 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-White-1994" TYPE="STUDY">White 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rossignol-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Rossignol 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hewitt-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Hewitt 2000</LINK>) involved immunocompromised adults with AIDS. The age range of subjects in four of these studies was 21-60 years. The ages of participants in the study by Nord was not given. The presence of <I>Cryptosporidium</I> oocysts in stools was a prerequisite in the treatment studies. However, the duration of infection was not made clear in all studies. In three studies, subjects were included in the trials if there were <I>Cryptosporidium</I> oocysts in stools at entry. In order to be eligible subjects in the studies by Amadi/Rossignol, Hewitt and Nord, subjects had to have had <I>C. parvum</I> oocysts in their stools for at least 7, 14 or 30 days, respectively. The laboratory methods used to diagnose <I>Cryptosporidium</I> oocysts were clearly described in four studies (<LINK REF="STD-Wittenberg-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Wittenberg 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-White-1994" TYPE="STUDY">White 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rossignol-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Rossignol 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Amadi-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Amadi 2002</LINK>). </P>
<P>Interventions</P>
<P>Of the seven treatment studies, two studies looked at the effectiveness of nitazoxanide (<LINK REF="STD-Rossignol-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Rossignol 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Amadi-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Amadi 2002</LINK>), two studies were on paramomycin (<LINK REF="STD-White-1994" TYPE="STUDY">White 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hewitt-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Hewitt 2000</LINK>), one study was on spiramycin (<LINK REF="STD-Wittenberg-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Wittenberg 1989</LINK>), one study on bovine immunoglobulin (<LINK REF="STD-Nord-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Nord 1990</LINK>) and another on bovine dialyzable leukocyte extract (<LINK REF="STD-McMeeking-1990" TYPE="STUDY">McMeeking 1990</LINK>).</P>
<P>In the study by Amadi, children received 100mg nitazoxanide or matching placebo twice daily for three consecutive days, whilst Rossignol randomised adults to receive either 500mg or 1000mg of Nitazoxanide or placebo 12 hourly for fourteen days. </P>
<P>In one of the two paramomycin studies, Hewitt randomised participants to receive 500mg of paramomycin or placebo for 21 days, after which all were given paramomycin non-blinded. White randomised participants to receive 25-35 mg/kg/day paramomycin or placebo for 14 days. They were crossed over to the other treatment for an additional 14 days. In the only spiramycin study, Wittenberg randomised participants to receive 75 mg/kg/day of spiramycin for five days. In the two bovine immunoglobulin studies, McMeeking gave bovine dialyzable leukocyte extract, 5 IU or 5x108 lymphocyte equivalent, weekly for eight weeks. Nord used bovine hyperimmune colostrum or bovine colostrum with no anti-cryptosporidial activity at a dose of 30 mg total immunoglobulin / ml for 10 days. </P>
<P>Outcomes<BR/>This review's primary outcome measures include clinical response based on change in frequency or duration of diarrhoea and mortality and parasitological response as assessed by oocyst clearance. Recurrence of diarrhoea was not measured because there was insufficient data in the included studies. This review's secondary outcome measure is the occurrence of side effects. </P>
<P>Paramomycin<BR/>Hewitt defined clinical response as measured by an average number of bowel movements per day, in association with a concurrent need for anti-diarrhoeal agents that was lower than that required for entry to the study. Three categories of clinical response were investigated: complete, partial, and no change/increase in use of anti-diarrhoeal preparations. Other outcome measures included quantification of <I>Cryptosporidium</I> oocytes (defined as the number of parasites in the stool), drug tolerance (as defined by the occurrence of dose limiting toxicity), changes in weight and abdominal symptoms as reported by the participant, and adverse events. White defined a clinical response based on stool frequency (the number of stools in 24 hours at baseline and at the end of treatment) and stool weight in grams, comparing baseline measurement with end of treatment. The participant assessed stool firmness subjectively as watery, loose, or firm. Oocyst counts (defined as mean concentration and as total 24-hour excretion) were compared at baseline and at the end of therapy.</P>
<P>Nitazoxanide<BR/>Amadi defined clinical response on day seven as either "well" (defined as no symptoms, no watery stools, no more than two soft stools per 24 hours, or no symptoms and no unformed stools within the past 48 hours) or "continuing illness" (not fulfilling the definition of "well"), while parasitological response was assessed by collection of two stool samples on day seven and eight and examination for the presence of oocyst of <I>C. parvum</I> by auramine phenol smear microscopy. Response was categorised as either eradication (no oocyst observed in either post-treatment stool sample) or persistence (oocyst observed in either or both post-treatment stool samples). Rossignol defined clinical cure as complete resolution of diarrhoea and other symptoms of cryptosporidiosis assessed on day 15 and 29, while parasitological cure was defined as three consecutive negative faecal examinations on days 15, 22 and 29 in the treatment group and days 7 and 15 for the placebo group.</P>
<P>Spiramycin<BR/>Wittenberg defined clinical response based on the stool frequency for both arms and parasitological response based on the number with a negative stool before discharge.</P>
<P>Bovine dialyzable leukocyte extract<BR/>McMeeking defined clinical response based on stool frequency (change in frequency defined as an increase or decrease from baseline over eight weeks), stool consistency (formed, semi-formed, or liquid) and stool volume. Parasitological response was defined, based on oocyst eradication, as either negative or positive.</P>
<P>Bovine hyperimmune colostrum<BR/>Outcomes considered by Nord include stool frequency (number of stools in 24 hours), stool consistency (firm, soft, thick liquid, watery, or rice-water as assessed by physician) and stool volume in mls. Parasitological response was defined based on the quantitative excretion of cryptosporidium oocyst (oocyst per ml)</P>

<STUDY_QUALITY>
<P>Jadad score (<LINK REF="REF-Jadad-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jadad 1996</LINK>) ranged from four to five (see table of Jadad scores). Three studies scored five (<LINK REF="STD-Wittenberg-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Wittenberg 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hewitt-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Hewitt 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Amadi-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Amadi 2002</LINK>), whilst the remaining scored four (<LINK REF="STD-McMeeking-1990" TYPE="STUDY">McMeeking 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nord-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Nord 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-White-1994" TYPE="STUDY">White 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rossignol-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Rossignol 1998</LINK>). There was no disagreement in the allocation of quality scores between the two reviewers.</P>
<P>Randomisation<BR/>All studies were described as randomised. However, the method of randomisation was described and appropriate in only three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Wittenberg-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Wittenberg 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hewitt-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Hewitt 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Amadi-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Amadi 2002</LINK>) who described the use of computer-generated lists or tables of random number lists. The remaining four studies (<LINK REF="STD-McMeeking-1990" TYPE="STUDY">McMeeking 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nord-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Nord 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-White-1994" TYPE="STUDY">White 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rossignol-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Rossignol 1998</LINK>) did not describe the method of randomisation. </P>
<P>Blinding<BR/>All seven studies were described as double blind. Within three of these studies (<LINK REF="STD-White-1994" TYPE="STUDY">White 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rossignol-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Rossignol 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Amadi-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Amadi 2002</LINK>) participant, clinician, laboratory personnel/investigators blinding was described. </P>
<P>Concealment of allocation<BR/>Concealment of allocation was clear in three of seven studies.

</STUDY_QUALITY>
<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
<P>Prevention<BR/>No studies were found that assessed prevention.</P>
<P>Treatment<BR/>Seven trials involving 169 participants were included. There were 130 adults with AIDS enrolled in five studies. The remaining two studies enrolled 139 children. Amadi enrolled 100 children over one year old, whilst Wittenberg's study was based on 39 infants, all less than one year old. All children were either malnourished or had AIDS. Due to the limited number of studies available, it was not possible to assess evidence of publication bias using funnel plots.</P>
<P>Duration of diarrhoea, mortality and parasitological clearance</P>
<P>Comparison one: Nitazoxanide versus placebo. The random effects summary estimate of the relative risk for resolution of diarrhoea for the two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Rossignol-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Rossignol 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Amadi-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Amadi 2002</LINK>) was 0.83 (95% CI 0.36 - 1.94), showing no evidence of effectiveness compared with placebo. There were data on deaths from Amadi et al that showed a relative risk of 0.61 (95% CI 0.22 - 1.63) among all 96 children, based on five and eight deaths in the intervention and control arms respectively. Nitazoxanide led to a significant parasitological response compared with placebo among all children with a relative risk of 0.52 (95% CI 0.30 - 0.91). The effect was not significant for HIV-seropositive participants (RR 0.71 (95% CI 0.36 - 1.37)). HIV-seronegative participants on nitazoxanide had a significantly higher relative risk of achieving parasitological clearance of 0.26 (95% CI 0.09 - 0.80) based on a single study. </P>
<P>Comparison two: Paramomycin versus placebo. The two studies (<LINK REF="STD-White-1994" TYPE="STUDY">White 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hewitt-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Hewitt 2000</LINK>) showed no evidence that paramomycin is more effective in reducing the frequency of diarrhoea than placebo with a summary relative risk of 0.74 (95% CI 0.42 - 1.31). The use of paramomycin does not significantly lead to a parasitological response with a relative risk of 0.73 (95% CI 0.38 - 1.39) for oocyst clearance.</P>
<P>Comparison three: Spiramycin versus placebo. Only one study (<LINK REF="STD-Wittenberg-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Wittenberg 1989</LINK>) compared the effect of spiramycin with placebo. No outcome data was presented on diarrhoea duration or frequency. There was no difference in mortality between the two arms of the trial (RR 0.43 (95% CI 0.04 - 4.35)), with one and two deaths among 21 and 18 participants in the intervention and control arms respectively. Spiramycin did not significantly lower oocyst concentration compared with placebo (RR 0.88 (95% CI 0.37 - 2.05)). Although duration of hospitalisation was not a primary outcome, this study found no significant difference in reduction of the duration of hospitalisation (mean difference of - 0.40 days (95% CI -6.62 to 5.82 )).</P>
<P>Comparison four: Bovine dialyzable leukocyte extract. Only one study (<LINK REF="STD-McMeeking-1990" TYPE="STUDY">McMeeking 1990</LINK>) compared this intervention with placebo. The relative risk for decreased stool frequency was 0.19 (95% CI 0.03 - 1.19) and there was no evidence of a significant decrease in stool volume (mean difference of 4.74 (95% CI 0.75 - 8.73)). There was no evidence that bovine dialyzable leukocyte extract reduced oocyst concentration among participants with cryptosporidiosis compared to controls (RR 0.24 (95% CI 0.04 - 1.44). </P>
<P>Comparison five: Bovine hyperimmune colostrums. A pilot study (<LINK REF="STD-Nord-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Nord 1990</LINK>) of five participants showed no evidence in improvement, as assessed by volume of stool, following 10 days infusion of bovine colostrums (RR 3.00 (95% CI 0.61 - 14.86)). There was no evidence of a reduction in oocyst concentration per ml of stool (RR 0.27 (95% CI 0.02 - 3.74)).</P>
<P>The secondary outcomes measured in this review (adverse effects) occurred infrequently in all the studies. A variety of adverse effects were reported in the studies. None of the papers reported sufficiently similar results to allow a meta-analysis of adverse effects. Similarly, none of the individual trials reported data on tolerability to allow a comparison. In one study (<LINK REF="STD-Rossignol-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Rossignol 1998</LINK>), nitazoxanide use was stated as "probably related" to a case of viral myocarditis (none in placebo group) and two cases of vomiting (one in placebo group). In the second study (<LINK REF="STD-Amadi-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Amadi 2002</LINK>), 58 adverse events were observed. None of them were considered related or possibly related to the blinded intervention, but rather to features of HIV infection and AIDS. One participant had vomiting after responding parasitologically, possibly related to nitazoxanide. Twelve adverse events were reported by 11 participants in the nitazoxanide treatment group, compared with 14 adverse events reported by 13 patients in the placebo group. The adverse events consisted of abdominal pain, dyspepsia, constipation, yellow discoloration of urine, dysuria dry mouth (1 nitazoxanide). Two adverse events, both episodes of dizziness in adult patients, resulted in discontinuation of therapy. No side effects of paramomycin were noted in one study (<LINK REF="STD-Hewitt-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Hewitt 2000</LINK>), while the second study (<LINK REF="STD-White-1994" TYPE="STUDY">White 1994</LINK>) did not report adverse events. The spiramycin study did not report adverse events. Patients on Bovine dialyzable leukocyte extract experienced no adverse signs, while bovine hyperimmune colostrum caused nausea and vomiting in two patients and mild abdominal cramps in one patient. One control patient on bovine colostrum also had nausea and vomiting.</P>
<P>Developed versus developing country<BR/>Subgroup analysis by developed versus developing country was not possible due to the limited number of eligible studies identified. Both nitazoxanide studies were conducted in developing countries.</P>
</INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>The studies presented in this review are disparate in design, and several are small in size. Based upon the paucity of evidence, we were not able to demonstrate the effectiveness of any therapeutic agent in the treatment of immunocompromised persons with cryptosporidiosis. A significant effect on parasitological clearance was observed with nitazoxanide when all patient groups were included. A randomised, double-blind placebo-controlled trial was excluded from this analysis because the target population is not immunocompromised (<LINK REF="STD-Rossignol-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Rossignol 2001</LINK>). This study found nitazoxanide treatment reduced the duration of both diarrhoea (P&lt;.0001) and oocyst shedding (P&lt;.0001). The effect of nitazoxanide in immunocompromised persons needs investigating in a larger trial.</P>
<P>None of the prevention studies were of sufficiently adequate quality to be included in this study. There are several published studies of interventions for the prevention of diarrhoea (not specifically due to cryptosporidiosis), especially from developing countries, summarised in a recent systematic review and meta-analysis (<LINK REF="REF-Fewtrell-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fewtrell 2005</LINK>). The authors reported that multiple interventions, hygiene, and water quality improvement measures significantly reduce the levels of diarrhoeal illness. The impact of hygiene and household treatment interventions was the strongest. Some of these diarrhoeal illnesses may have been due to cryptosporidiosis.</P>
<P>Since the emergence of AIDS, medical interest in the diagnosis and management of cryptosporidiosis has increased dramatically. There are currently several published practice guidelines for the prevention and treatment of cryptosporidiosis (<LINK REF="REF-CDC-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">CDC 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hunter-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hunter 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kaplan-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kaplan 2002</LINK>). The paucity of evidence for an effective intervention has meant that most of these guidelines rely on studies that are of poor quality. For HIV-infected persons, highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) is the mainstay of preventing and managing cryptosporidiosis. HAART can lead to complete resolution of clinical symptoms and oocysts (<LINK REF="REF-Grube-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grube 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Maggi-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maggi 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Miao-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Miao 2000</LINK>). This intervention is not available for HIV patients who are failing HAART or those unable to access HAART in developing countries. Among these immunocompromised persons without the option of an effective treatment for the underlying disease, supportive management, including rehydration therapy, electrolyte replacement, and anti-motility agents will remain the only alternatives for care until better drugs emerge. </P>
<P>Limitations <BR/>The studies were limited by variation in important indicators of quality, such as allocation concealment, description of randomisation, and power and dropout rates. The paramomycin study by White et al had a high dropout rate and was underpowered. The study by Nord et al was very small (5 participants). For three interventions, only a single study was identified; therefore, a meta-analysis was not possible. Due to the small number of studies, identified formal assessment of publication bias using funnel plots and Eggers test was not possible. Also, we did not explore heterogeneity using statistical approaches.</P>
<P>The development of new therapies must rely on knowledge of <I>Cryptosporidium</I> biology. Progress in developing tissue culture systems capable of sustaining <I>C. parvum</I> infection for in vitro test of therapies has only been achieved to a limited degree (<LINK REF="REF-Theodos-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Theodos 1998</LINK>). A large number of antimicrobial drugs have been tested in animals and humans infected with <I>Cryptosporidium</I> with no clear evidence of consistent effectiveness against this parasite (<LINK REF="REF-Mead-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mead 2002</LINK>). The completion of the genome sequence of <I>C. parvum</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Abrahamsen-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Abrahamsen 2004</LINK>) provides an important opportunity to understand the mechanisms of resistance, identify targets, and produce candidate agents. Recent advances in our understanding of the mechanism of resistance have shed light on the reasons for treatment failure. Unlike other parasites, <I>Cryptosporidium</I> salvages pyrimidine and purine bases from its host (<LINK REF="REF-Striepen-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Striepen 2004</LINK>). This is the key reason why <I>Cryptosporidium</I> has remained resistant to anti-folate drugs, which usually inhibit the de novo synthesis of these nucleotides. <I>C. parvum</I> relies on inosine 5'-monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH) to produce guanine nucleotides, and is highly susceptible to IMPDH inhibition (<LINK REF="REF-Umejiego-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Umejiego 2004</LINK>). Both ribavirin and mycophenolic acid, which inhibit IMPDH, have been shown to have dose dependent effect on <I>C. parvum</I> development. It appears very likely that, based on these observations, more effective drugs for cryptosporidiosis will be designed and should be evaluated rapidly with randomised controlled trials in immunocompromised individuals.</P>
<P>This review concludes that there is no evidence to support the role of chemotherapeutic agents in the management of cryptosporidiosis among immunocompromised individuals. Some evidence of effectiveness for nitazoxanide in a combined population of immunocompetent and immunocompromised individuals was identified and is worth further study. There were no randomised controlled trials of preventive interventions primarily targeted at preventing cryptosporidiosis in immunocompromised individuals.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>This review confirms the absence of evidence for effective agents in the management of cryptosporidiosis. The results indicate that nitaxozanide reduces the load of parasites and may be useful in immunocompetent individuals. Given the seriousness of the outcomes of this infection in immunocompromised individuals and the potential to improve compliance by decreasing nausea and vomiting, it is worth considering using nitaxozanide while clinicians await further evidence for its effectiveness in immunocompromised patients. The use of fluid and electrolyte replacement and anti-motility agents may be the only option for the majority of immunocompromised patients. The absence of effective therapy highlights the need to ensure that infection is avoided. Unfortunately, evidence for the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of preventive interventions is also lacking.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>The consequences of cryptosporidiosis to immunocompromised individuals and the health services are of major importance. All interventions with the potential to decrease the risk of mortality and morbidity need appropriate evaluation so that any benefits may be maximised. A large-scale trial of nitazoxanide among immunocompromised individuals is needed. Due to the inability of most current interventions to reduce the severity of or provide a cure for cryptosporidiosis, there is an urgent need for high-quality randomised controlled trials of new agents such as ribavirin and mycophenolic acid for the treatment of cryptosporidiosis. Large-scale randomised controlled trials and cost-effectiveness studies of interventions to prevent cryptosporidiosis, especially among immunocompromised persons, are needed.</P>
