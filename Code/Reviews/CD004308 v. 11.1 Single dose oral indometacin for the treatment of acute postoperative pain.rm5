<SUMMARY>
<TITLE>Indometacin in use as a single dose for treating acute postoperative pain</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Indometacin is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) used for treating postoperative pain. This review found only one small study of women with post-episiotomy pain where the effectiveness of the drug (taken by mouth) was compared with a placebo. Conclusions about the effectiveness of orally administered indometacin cannot be made until more studies are undertaken. </P>
</SUMMARY_BODY>
</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>This is an updated version of the original Cochrane review published in Issue 4, 2004. Indometacin is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) used most commonly for the treatment of inflammation and pain resulting from rheumatic disease (arthritis), and less commonly in postoperative pain management. When taken for chronic pain conditions, indometacin has been associated with a high incidence of adverse events. The benefits and harms of orally-administered indometacin for postoperative pain are not clear. </P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To determine the efficacy of a single dose of oral indometacin compared with placebo in treating acute postoperative pain in adults, and to analyse information relating to adverse events. </P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>We searched the Cochrane CENTRAL Register of Controlled Trials in <I>The Cochrane Library</I>, MEDLINE, EMBASE<I> </I>and the Oxford Pain Relief Database for relevant studies in January 2002 and for the updated search in December 2007. Additional studies were sought from the reference lists of retrieved studies. <BR/> </P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Studies were included in the review if they were randomised, double blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials using a single oral dose of indometacin in adults with acute postoperative pain. </P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Studies were assessed independently by two review authors. Pain relief or pain intensity data were extracted and converted into dichotomous information to give the number of participants with at least 50% pain relief over four to six hours. The relative benefit for at least 50% pain relief was calculated.<BR/> </P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>In the original review one study of 59 women with post-episiotomy pain met the inclusion criteria. The dose of indometacin assessed against placebo was 50 mg, and the results concluded that indometacin was not significantly better than placebo for relieving postoperative pain at four to six hours. There was insufficient information to conduct further efficacy analyses or assess adverse events. No further studies were identified in the update of this review.<BR/> </P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>Conclusions about the clinical efficacy of indometacin for postoperative pain cannot be made unless more studies are conducted for a variety of surgical procedures, and different doses of indometacin are assessed. Since the last version of this review no new relevant studies have been identified.</P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
</ABSTRACT>
<BODY MODIFIED="2008-05-28 14:42:37 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Sheena Derry">
<BACKGROUND>
<P>This is an update of a previously published review in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (Issue 4, 2004) on 'Single dose indometacin for the treatment of acute postoperative pain'.</P>
<P>Indometacin (indomethacin) is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) used most commonly for the treatment of inflammation and pain resulting from rheumatic disease. Indometacin is also used to treat inflammation, pain and oedema following orthopaedic procedures (<LINK REF="REF-Martindale-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Martindale 1999</LINK>), and is the first line of treatment for some rare forms of headache such as chronic paroxysmal hemicrania (CPH) and episodic paroxysmal hemicrania (<LINK REF="REF-Pareja-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pareja 2001</LINK>). Indometacin is also used for treating acute attacks of gout. Indometacin is less commonly used to treat acute postoperative pain, and data on the frequency of indometacin administration in postoperative pain management is not available. </P>
<P>For the treatment of chronic pain, the maximum recommended daily oral dose of indometacin is 200 mg, and a relatively high incidence of adverse events has been associated with its use compared with other NSAIDs. The most commonly reported of these are gastrointestinal disturbances (including ulceration, bleeding and diarrhoea), headache and dizziness (<LINK REF="REF-Martindale-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Martindale 1999</LINK>). Less common effects include drowsiness, insomnia, convulsions, psychiatric disturbances, hypertension, hyperglycaemia, peripheral neuropathy and intestinal strictures (<LINK REF="REF-BNF-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">BNF 2006</LINK>). These adverse events may be less likely to occur if indometacin is taken over a comparatively short period of time, for the treatment of postoperative pain.</P>
<P>The postoperative pain period is often dominated by the need to find effective ways of blocking the inflammatory reaction and relieving pain (<LINK REF="REF-Salvato-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Salvato 1992</LINK>). In one US study, postsurgical pain was the leading cause of concern in 57% of patients before surgery (<LINK REF="REF-Warfield-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Warfield 1995</LINK>). This concern is not misplaced. A survey of 5150 newly-discharged NHS patients in UK hospitals showed that 61% suffered pain, which was present all or most of the time in one third of cases (<LINK REF="REF-Bruster-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bruster 1994</LINK>). A recent, extensive review of postoperative pain management found that severe pain, and poor or fair pain relief, was experienced by 20% of hospital patients (<LINK REF="REF-Dolin-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dolin 2002</LINK>). Some believe that aggressive treatment of acute pain may reduce further complications, notably progression to chronic pain states (<LINK REF="REF-Coda-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Coda 2001</LINK>). Therefore, since inadequately managed pain is associated with adverse consequences, it is important to assess the efficacy of available treatments. </P>
<P>No other systematic review of the effectiveness of orally administered indometacin for postoperative pain has been undertaken. The results from this review of studies of indometacin versus placebo help to establish the evidence-base for the use of indometacin for postoperative pain relief and could also enable the relative efficacy of indometacin compared to other NSAIDs to be determined.</P>
</BACKGROUND>

<B>Selection of studies</B>
<BR/>Potential studies were located and independently assessed by two review authors. (Disputes as to whether a study met the selection criteria would have been settled by discussion between all review authors). Reasons for excluding studies from the review were documented, and can be seen in the 'Characteristics of excluded studies' table.</P>

</UL>
<P>
<BR/>
<B>Data synthesis</B>
<BR/>It was our intention to analyse study data for the number of participants randomised to each arm of the included studies as follows:<BR/>Mean TOTPAR (total pain relief) or mean SPID (summed pain intensity difference) over four to six hours was to be extracted, or calculated from pain data provided by each included study. These data would be converted into %maxTOTPAR or %maxSPID (the percentage of the maximum possible total pain relief or summed pain intensity), using verified equations (<LINK REF="REF-Cooper-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cooper 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moore-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moore-1997a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 1997a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moore-1997b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 1997b</LINK>). This data would be used to calculate the number of participants in each study with at least 50% pain relief for both indometacin and placebo. From this, number-needed-to-treat-to-benefit (NNTB) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) could be calculated (<LINK REF="REF-Cook-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cook 1995</LINK>). Relative benefit estimates with 95% CI could also be calculated using the fixed-effect model (<LINK REF="REF-Morris-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morris 1995</LINK>) in Review Manager (version 4.2.10). A statistically significant benefit of the active treatment over placebo would be assumed when the upper limit of the 95% CI of the relative benefit was greater than one. </P>
<P>
<B>Intention to treat analysis</B>
<BR/>Participants for whom no outcome data were available (withdrawals, protocol violators, etc) were computed as 'available case analysis', as described in the Cochrane Handbook (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2006</LINK>). Only data for known results are included, with the denominator being the total number of participants who completed the trial for the outcome being assessed.</P>

<BR/>
<B>Notes on the scoring system</B>
<BR/>
<B>
<I>Randomisation</I>
</B>
<BR/>A method to generate the sequence of randomisation is regarded as appropriate if the method allows each study participant to have the same chance of receiving each intervention and the investigators cannot predict which treatment is next. Methods of allocation using date of birth, date of admission, hospital numbers or alternation are not regarded as appropriate.</P>
<P>
<B>
<I>Double-blinding</I>
</B>
<BR/>A study is regarded as double-blind if the word double-blind is used. The method is regarded as appropriate if it is stated that neither the person doing the assessments nor the study participant can identify the intervention being assessed or if, in the absence of such a statement, the use of active placebos, identical placebos or dummies is mentioned.</P>
<P>
<B>
<I>Withdrawals and drop outs</I>
</B>
<BR/>Participants who were included in the study but did not complete the observation period or who were not included in the analysis must be described. The number and the reasons for withdrawal must be stated. If there were no withdrawals, it should be stated in the article. If there is no statement on withdrawals, this item must be given no points.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of included study</B>
<BR/>The methodological quality of the included study was scored independently by two review authors, and the study achieved a score of two points out of a possible five, receiving one point each for randomisation and double blinding.</P>
</STUDY_QUALITY>
<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
<P>One small study of 94 women who experienced moderate to severe pain following episiotomy met the inclusion criteria for this review in the original searches, and no further studies were identified for the update. Only 29 participants were treated with indometacin, and 30 with placebo. The lack of studies meant that there were insufficient data to conduct a meta-analysis, and it was not possible to assess the mean time to remedication, or the adverse effects of single dose oral indometacin.</P>
<P>The results of the included study are summarised as follows:</P>
<P>
<B>Indometacin 50 mg versus placebo<BR/>
</B>The number of participants with at least 50% pain relief at six hours was 20 out of 29 (69%) for indometacin and 16 out of 30 (53%) for placebo. There was therefore no significant difference between treatment and placebo (Relative Risk 1.3, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.96). The NNTB was not calculated.<B>
<BR/>
</B>
<BR/>
<B>Adverse events and withdrawals</B>
<BR/>Only adverse events related to the gastrointestinal tract were recorded in the included study. The number of participants reporting any adverse event was four out of 29 participants receiving indometacin 50 mg, and one out of 30 participants receiving placebo. The severity or specific nature of these events were not reported. There was one withdrawal in the indometacin 50 mg arm of the study and 15 in the placebo group. The reasons why participants withdrew from the study were not stated.</P>
</INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>Only one small study met the inclusion criteria for this review, and showed that indometacin 50 mg was no better than placebo for the treatment of acute postoperative pain (Relative Risk 1.3, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.96). However, this study was limited in terms of quality and size, and therefore validity. Due to the random play of chance, small studies report results that are often unreliable (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 1998</LINK>) and therefore conclusions about the clinical efficacy of indometacin cannot be drawn from the available evidence. Efficacy can be determined only if more, high quality studies using indometacin become available. However, it is unlikely that such studies will be performed since indometacin is one of the older NSAIDs on the market; newer, safer, and efficacious NSAIDs have since been developed.</P>
<P>It was not possible to analyse adverse events due to lack of information. When prescribed for chronic pain conditions, indometacin use is associated with many adverse events, more than most other NSAIDs. Accurate reporting of adverse events in studies using indometacin for acute postoperative pain should be a priority. Unfortunately, poor reporting of adverse events is common in acute pain studies (<LINK REF="REF-Edwards-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Edwards 1999</LINK>).</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>The update of this review has not identified any further information to provide evidence for or against the use of Single dose oral indometacin for the treatment of acute postoperative pain. Until more information becomes available, it is not possible to make recommendations about the use of single dose oral indometacin for the relief of postoperative pain.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>More information is needed to accurately determine the efficacy of indometacin in postoperative pain. Better reporting of information in clinical trials using indometacin is required. Appropriate trial methods are needed to obtain information about adverse events and participant withdrawals, and these need to be reported consistently in individual trials. However, it is unlikely that such studies will be performed since indometacin is one of the older NSAIDs on the market; newer, safer, and efficacious NSAIDs have since been developed.</P>
