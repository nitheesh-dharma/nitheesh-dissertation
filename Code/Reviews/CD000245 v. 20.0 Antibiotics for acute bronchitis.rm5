<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2017-06-08 14:22:46 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Liz Dooley">
<P>
<B>Review question</B>
</P>
<P>We wanted to know whether antibiotics improve outcomes for people with acute bronchitis. We also assessed potential adverse effects of antibiotic therapy.</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>Acute bronchitis is a clinical diagnosis (based on medical signs and patient-reported symptoms) for an acute cough, which may or may not be associated with coughing up mucus or sputum. Acute bronchitis can be caused by viruses or bacteria. Symptoms generally last for two weeks but can last for up to eight weeks. Antibiotics are commonly prescribed to treat acute bronchitis, but they can have adverse effects such as nausea and diarrhoea as well as cause more serious reactions in those who are allergic. There is no practical test to distinguish between bacterial and viral bronchitis.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>We included randomised controlled trials comparing any antibiotic therapy with placebo or no treatment in people with acute bronchitis or acute productive cough and no underlying chronic lung condition. We included 17 trials with 5099 participants. Co-treatments with other medications to relieve symptoms were allowed if they were given to all participants in the study.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>Our evidence is current to 13 January, 2017.</P>
<P>We found limited evidence of clinical benefit to support the use of antibiotics for acute bronchitis. Some people treated with antibiotics recovered a bit more quickly with reduced cough-related outcomes. However, this difference may not be of practical importance as it amounted to a difference of half a day over an 8- to 10-day period. There was a small but significant increase in adverse side effects in people treated with antibiotics. The most commonly reported side effects included nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, headache, and rash.</P>
<P>This review suggests that there is limited benefit to the patient in using antibiotics for acute bronchitis in otherwise healthy individuals. More research is needed on the effects of using antibiotics for acute bronchitis in frail, elderly people with multiple chronic conditions who may not have been included in the existing trials. Antibiotic use needs to be considered in the context of the potential side effects, medicalisation for a self limiting condition, cost of antibiotic treatment, and in particular associated population-level harms due to increasing antibiotic resistance.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
</P>
<P>The quality of these trials was generally good, particularly for more recent studies.</P>

<P>We did not identify any new trials for inclusion in this 2017 update. We included 17 trials with 5099 participants in the primary analysis. The quality of trials was generally good. At follow-up there was no difference in participants described as being clinically improved between the antibiotic and placebo groups (11 studies with 3841 participants, risk ratio (RR) 1.07, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.99 to 1.15). Participants given antibiotics were less likely to have a cough (4 studies with 275 participants, RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.85; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 6) and a night cough (4 studies with 538 participants, RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.83; NNTB 7). Participants given antibiotics had a shorter mean cough duration (7 studies with 2776 participants, mean difference (MD) -0.46 days, 95% CI -0.87 to -0.04). The differences in presence of a productive cough at follow-up and MD of productive cough did not reach statistical significance.</P>
<P>Antibiotic-treated participants were more likely to be improved according to clinician's global assessment (6 studies with 891 participants, RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.48 to 0.79; NNTB 11) and were less likely to have an abnormal lung exam (5 studies with 613 participants, RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.41 to 0.70; NNTB 6). Antibiotic-treated participants also had a reduction in days feeling ill (5 studies with 809 participants, MD -0.64 days, 95% CI -1.16 to -0.13) and days with impaired activity (6 studies with 767 participants, MD -0.49 days, 95% CI -0.94 to -0.04). The differences in proportions with activity limitations at follow-up did not reach statistical significance. There was a significant trend towards an increase in adverse effects in the antibiotic group (12 studies with 3496 participants, RR 1.20, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.36; NNT for an additional harmful outcome 24).</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2017-06-06 06:24:22 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is limited evidence of clinical benefit to support the use of antibiotics in acute bronchitis. Antibiotics may have a modest beneficial effect in some patients such as frail, elderly people with multimorbidity who may not have been included in trials to date. However, the magnitude of this benefit needs to be considered in the broader context of potential side effects, medicalisation for a self limiting condition, increased resistance to respiratory pathogens, and cost of antibiotic treatment.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2017-06-08 14:24:50 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Liz Dooley">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2017-06-08 14:24:50 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Liz Dooley">
<P>Acute bronchitis is a common illness characterised by fever and cough that is often wheezy in nature and that may or may not be productive. The condition occurs when the bronchi become inflamed due to either viral or bacterial infection. Symptoms generally last for two weeks, but the associated cough can last for up to eight weeks (<LINK REF="REF-CDC-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">CDC 2013</LINK>). Acute bronchitis is the ninth most common outpatient illness recorded by physicians in ambulatory practice in the USA (<LINK REF="REF-Delozier-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Delozier 1989</LINK>), and the fifth most common outpatient illness encountered by Australian general practitioners, for whom it represents 3.5% of encounters and 2.4% of problems seen (<LINK REF="REF-Meza-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meza 1994</LINK>). In the UK, there are 300 to 400 consultations for treatment of respiratory tract infections per 1000 registered patients each year, and while antibiotic prescribing for these conditions declined between 1995 and 2000, it has since stabilised (<LINK REF="REF-Gulliford-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gulliford 2011</LINK>). Data provided by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control on trends in antimicrobial consumption across Europe suggests that overall antibiotic use varies across Europe, with most countries showing an increase between 1997 and 2010 (<LINK REF="REF-ECDC-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">ECDC 2013</LINK>).</P>
<P>Population-based estimates of the incidence of acute bronchitis range from 33 to 45 cases per 1000 per year (<LINK REF="REF-Ayres-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ayres 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mainous-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mainous 1996</LINK>). People with bronchitis miss an average of two to three days off work per episode. The great majority of episodes of acute bronchitis in healthy individuals are presumed to be viral infections, although this has been questioned (<LINK REF="REF-Macfarlane-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Macfarlane 1994</LINK>). Community-based studies have isolated viruses in 8% to 23% of cases (<LINK REF="REF-Boldy-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boldy 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Macfarlane-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Macfarlane 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stuart_x002d_Harris-1965" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stuart-Harris 1965</LINK>). Other pathogens implicated in acute bronchitis are <I>Mycoplasma pneumoniae</I>, <I>Chlamydia pneumoniae</I>, and <I>Bordetella pertussis</I>, each of which has been identified in up to 25% of cases in various populations (<LINK REF="REF-Boldy-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boldy 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Falck-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Falck 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Foy-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Foy 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Grayston-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grayston 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Herwaldt-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Herwaldt 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jonsson-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jonsson 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-King-1996" TYPE="STUDY">King 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Macfarlane-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Macfarlane 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Robertson-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Robertson 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stuart_x002d_Harris-1965" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stuart-Harris 1965</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Thom-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thom 1994</LINK>). A more recent study assessing the aetiology and outcome of acute lower respiratory tract infection in 638 adults in UK primary care showed that in 55% of cases viral or bacterial pathogens were identified (<LINK REF="REF-Macfarlane-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Macfarlane 2001</LINK>).</P>

<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2017-06-08 14:23:56 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Liz Dooley">
<P>The use of antibiotics in people with acute bronchial infections remains a controversial area in primary healthcare practice (<LINK REF="REF-Coenen-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Coenen 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Del-Mar-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Del Mar 2016</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gonzales-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gonzales 1995</LINK>). <I>Streptococcus pneumoniae</I>,<I> Haemophilus influenzae</I>, and<I> Moraxella catarrhalis</I> have been isolated from sputum samples in up to 45% of people with acute bronchitis (<LINK REF="REF-Henry-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Henry 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Macfarlane-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Macfarlane 1993</LINK>), but their role is difficult to assess due to potential oropharyngeal colonisation in healthy individuals (<LINK REF="REF-Laurenzi-1961" TYPE="REFERENCE">Laurenzi 1961</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Smith-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smith 1986</LINK>). Unfortunately, there are no clinically useful criteria that accurately help distinguish bacterial from viral bronchial infections, therefore some authors have called for physicians to stop prescribing antibiotics for people with acute bronchitis (<LINK REF="REF-Gonzales-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gonzales 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hueston-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hueston 1997</LINK>).

<THEORY MODIFIED="2017-06-06 10:01:49 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Antibiotics may improve outcomes in acute bronchitis if the disease is caused by a bacterial infection. Antibiotics have no antiviral activity and are therefore not effective in viral bronchitis. In addition, antibiotics can cause harm due to their negative effect on normal bacteria colonising the intestine. The most common adverse effects of antibiotics include gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea and diarrhoea, but they can also cause more serious reactions related to anaphylaxis in those who are allergic.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2017-06-06 10:09:32 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Some estimate of the probable effectiveness of antibiotic therapy for acute bronchitis is needed given the frequent occurrence of the condition. If found to be effective, antibiotics could shorten the course of the disease and consequently reduce the associated loss of productive work time. However, any benefit from antibiotics must be weighed against the possibility that excessive antibiotic use will lead to increases in cost and patient morbidity, as well as the development of resistant strains of common organisms, <LINK REF="REF-Coenen-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Coenen 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Molstad-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Molstad 1992</LINK>, and unnecessary medicalisation of individuals with a self limiting illness (<LINK REF="STD-Little-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Little 2005</LINK>).

<P>Most studies used clinical findings to exclude patients thought to have pneumonia.

These four studies excluded those with radiological evidence of pneumonia or tuberculosis. One study excluded people with any abnormality noted on examination of the chest (<LINK REF="STD-Stott-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Stott 1976</LINK>).

The number of studies that provided data for the outcomes in this review therefore ranged from three to 11. None of the summary outcomes in the primary analysis exhibited statistically significant heterogeneity apart from the analysis of participants 'clinically improved'. Numbers of studies and participants included in the individual meta-analyses were generally small, although the meta-analysis for 'clinically improved' includes 11 studies, and the meta-analysis for adverse events includes 12 studies.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">1. Cough-related outcomes</HEADING>
<P>At the follow-up visit, participants given antibiotics were less likely to have a cough (4 studies with 275 participants, risk ratio (RR) 0.64, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.49 to 0.85; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 6) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>; <LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK>) or a night cough (4 studies with 538 participants, RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.83; NNTB 7) (<LINK REF="CMP-002.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.1</LINK>). The differences in presence of a productive cough at follow-up and days of productive cough did not reach statistical significance. Antibiotic-treated participants only had a significant reduction in mean duration of cough when the study by <LINK REF="STD-Little-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Little 2005</LINK>, which had a no-treatment comparison group, was excluded (<LINK REF="FIG-04" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 4</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Llor-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Llor 2013</LINK> also reported no significant difference in median days of cough between the antibiotic and placebo groups. In addition, sensitivity analysis altered the outcome of mean duration of productive cough, which was significantly reduced if the <LINK REF="STD-Howie-1970" TYPE="STUDY">Howie 1970</LINK> study relating to upper respiratory tract infection was excluded.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">2. Global assessment of improvement by clinicians at follow-up: 'clinically improved'</HEADING>
<P>For the 2011 update of the review, we added an analysis that included a broader outcome 'clinically improved', so that as many studies as possible could be included in a meta-analysis. This was particularly important following the inclusion of the <LINK REF="STD-Nduba-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Nduba 2008</LINK> study in 2011, which was of high quality, included a large number of participants, and showed no benefit from antibiotic use. This outcome includes additional data from the authors of the largest included study, (<LINK REF="STD-Little-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Little 2013</LINK>). The data from <LINK REF="STD-Little-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Little 2013</LINK> are based on numbers of participants no longer reporting their symptoms being "moderately bad" at one week. The published study presents mean symptom severity scores in the first few days, which indicated no significant difference between the intervention and control groups (<LINK REF="STD-Little-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Little 2013</LINK>). This outcome reflects the proportions of participants with clinical improvement and incorporates 'cure' as measured by a greater than 75% reduction in the Acute Bronchitis Severity Score (<LINK REF="STD-Nduba-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Nduba 2008</LINK>), global improvement or being well (<LINK REF="STD-Brickfield-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Brickfield 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Llor-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Llor 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Matthys-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Matthys 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stott-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Stott 1976</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Verheij-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Verheij 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Williamson-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Williamson 1984</LINK>), patient report of no limitations (<LINK REF="STD-Dunlay-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Dunlay 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Evans-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Evans 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Franks-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Franks 1984</LINK>), and resolution of symptoms rated as moderately bad, severe, or worsening (<LINK REF="STD-Little-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Little 2013</LINK>). This analysis includes 11 studies involving 3841 participants and shows no statistically significant difference between groups (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.15; NNTB 22) (<LINK REF="CMP-006.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 6.1</LINK>; <LINK REF="FIG-05" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 5</LINK>). The addition of data from <LINK REF="STD-Little-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Little 2013</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Llor-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Llor 2013</LINK> increased the heterogeneity for this analysis. A sensitivity analysis removing the studies reporting 'no limitation' made no difference to this result.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">3. General clinical outcomes</HEADING>
<P>Antibiotic-treated participants also had a reduction in the number of days feeling ill (5 studies with 809 participants, mean difference (MD) -0.64, 95% CI -1.16 to -0.13) (<LINK REF="CMP-008.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 8.1</LINK>; <LINK REF="FIG-06" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 6</LINK>) and a reduction in days with impaired activity (6 studies with 767 participants, MD -0.49, 95% CI -0.94 to -0.04) (<LINK REF="CMP-009.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 9.1</LINK>). There was no significant difference in proportions of participants with activity limitations at follow-up. Participants on antibiotics were more likely to be improved according to clinician's global assessment (6 studies with 891 participants, RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.48 to 0.79; NNTB 11) (<LINK REF="CMP-010.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 10.1</LINK>; <LINK REF="FIG-07" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 7</LINK>) and were less likely to have an abnormal lung exam (5 studies with 613 participants, RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.41 to 0.70; NNTB 6) (<LINK REF="CMP-011.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 11.1</LINK>). Additional clinical outcomes were reported by <LINK REF="STD-Little-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Little 2013</LINK>, who found no significant difference in mean symptom severity scores on days two to four (intervention score 1.62 (standard deviation (SD) 0.84) versus control score 1.69 (SD 0.84), P = 0.07), and <LINK REF="STD-Evans-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Evans 2002</LINK> found that azithromycin had no benefit in terms of health-related quality of life at day three and day seven follow-up. <LINK REF="STD-Llor-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Llor 2013</LINK> also reported no difference in time to overall symptom resolution between groups.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">1. Adverse effects</HEADING>
<P>With four exceptions (<LINK REF="STD-Brickfield-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Brickfield 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Little-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Little 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Matthys-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Matthys 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nduba-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Nduba 2008</LINK>), all of the studies found that participants in the antibiotic group reported more adverse effects than participants receiving a placebo (<LINK REF="FIG-08" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 8</LINK>). The RR of adverse effects in the antibiotic-treated group was statistically significant at 1.20 (95% CI 1.05 to 1.36; number needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome (NNTH) 24; 12 studies with 3496 participants) (<LINK REF="CMP-012.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 12.1</LINK>). The most commonly reported side effects included gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, or diarrhoea. Headaches, skin rash, and vaginitis also occurred. Side effects seemed to be mild, as only 0% to 13% (overall 3.7%) of participants withdrew because of them, and no deaths were reported.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Subgroups</HEADING>
<P>We were not able to obtain enough explicit data from the studies for various patient subgroups, therefore we did not carry out any sensitivity analyses based on patient characteristics (such as age, duration of illness, or smoking status). <LINK REF="STD-Little-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Little 2013</LINK> was adequately powered to assess the effect in the subgroup of participants aged over 60 and found no significant benefit in this group. The results in the individual studies for subgroup analyses were mixed. In one trial, all of the significantly improved outcomes from antibiotics occurred in non-smokers (<LINK REF="STD-Brickfield-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Brickfield 1986</LINK>). The other seven trials reported that they found no differences in antibiotic effectiveness between smokers and non-smokers, but included no data on these comparisons in their published reports. <LINK REF="STD-Verheij-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Verheij 1994</LINK>, using multiple regression, found that two subsets of patients were more likely to improve with doxycycline than placebo: participants over 55 years and those with very frequent cough who felt ill. <LINK REF="STD-Scherl-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Scherl 1987</LINK> found that only participants without coryza or sore throat had fewer days of cough or sputum with doxycycline. The only study to use Gram stains reported an earlier return to work for participants with a positive Gram stain who were treated with antibiotics (<LINK REF="STD-Franks-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Franks 1984</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Nduba-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Nduba 2008</LINK> also examined whether the use of amoxicillin was more effective than placebo in people who had tested positive for HIV and found no difference, though all participants had received a chest X-ray and those with any abnormal signs were excluded.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Little-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Little 2005</LINK>, which was added to the 2009 update, found no significant difference in outcomes between groups treated with immediate antibiotics compared with no antibiotic treatment. As this study did not involve a placebo control we included it in the analyses, where appropriate data were available, as a subgroup to highlight this difference. The one study added in the 2011 update was powered to detect equivalence between antibiotic and placebo and found no significant difference (<LINK REF="STD-Nduba-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Nduba 2008</LINK>). In fact, the point estimates favoured placebo treatment (84% cured on placebo versus 82.4% cured on amoxicillin). The largest included study, which was added in the 2014 update, was included in the 'clinically improved' and adverse effects meta-analyses (<LINK REF="STD-Little-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Little 2013</LINK>).</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-06-06 14:34:04 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We found mixed results across studies, with some suggesting marginal benefits for antibiotics, which are however of doubtful clinical significance. The inclusion of the largest multicentre study of the effectiveness of antibiotics in people with lower respiratory tract infections strengthens the evidence and also highlights a statistically significant increase in adverse events in the antibiotic-treated groups. However, it is possible that older patients with multimorbidity may not have been recruited to trials, so the evidence guiding decision-making in this group of patients is less certain.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2017-06-09 22:11:48 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In general, the available evidence suggests we should not be using antibiotics to treat acute bronchitis or lower respiratory tract infections when pneumonia is not expected. There is a modest benefit from antibiotics for some outcomes, but these are of minimal clinical significance. Any benefit is even less apparent in the sensitivity analysis, which included data from subgroups of patients with productive cough of short duration (two to four days) in conjunction with the common cold. Of the two trials in the primary analysis that limited enrolment to people who had been ill for less than one week, one did not show any benefit from antibiotics (<LINK REF="STD-Stott-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Stott 1976</LINK>), whilst the other showed modest benefit from antibiotics (<LINK REF="STD-Matthys-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Matthys 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>It is possible that the overall benefit noted from antibiotics resulted from the inclusion in some trials of people who may have had pneumonia instead of acute bronchitis. There was variation between studies as to whether chest X-rays were conducted as part of the evaluations. Only one trial obtained chest radiographs on all participants and then excluded those whose films were consistent with pneumonia (<LINK REF="STD-Brickfield-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Brickfield 1986</LINK>). In <LINK REF="STD-Little-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Little 2013</LINK>, a positive chest X-ray was not an automatic exclusion criterion, although some participants dropped out following such a finding. All of the remaining studies either excluded or obtained chest radiographs in patients with clinical findings of suspected pneumonia (which in most studies were focal findings on chest examination). Individual signs (such as crackles or fever) are not sensitive (<LINK REF="REF-Metlay-1997a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Metlay 1997a</LINK>), therefore their absence cannot be relied on to rule out pneumonia. On the other hand, since the prevalence of pneumonia in outpatients who present with cough is generally low (less than 5% in the USA) (<LINK REF="REF-Metlay-1997b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Metlay 1997b</LINK>), it is unlikely that a significant number of participants in these trials had pneumonia. In addition, this review was designed to test the effectiveness of treatment for acute bronchitis in clinical practice, and it is not standard practice to confirm the diagnosis of acute bronchitis with a chest X-ray unless there is a clinical suspicion of underlying pneumonia. Had we only included studies with chest X-ray confirmation of diagnosis, it would have limited the generalisability of the review findings.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2017-06-06 14:47:47 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Since there is no gold standard test, the diagnosis of acute bronchitis must be made on clinical grounds. All of the trials excluded people with chronic pulmonary disease and enrolled participants with recent onset of a respiratory illness with a productive cough. The results of the studies in the primary analysis that included participants with a productive cough, without specifically stating that the participants had acute bronchitis, were similar to the studies that used this specific terminology, as one showed some benefits from antibiotics (<LINK REF="STD-Verheij-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Verheij 1994</LINK>), and one did not (<LINK REF="STD-Stott-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Stott 1976</LINK>). Clinical characteristics of participants regarding the duration of illness and associated symptoms and physical findings did vary somewhat among studies, but were consistent with definitions generally used by primary care physicians (<LINK REF="REF-Oeffinger-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oeffinger 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Verheij-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Verheij 1990</LINK>). These results would therefore appear to be generalisable to the management of acute bronchitis in community practices.</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2017-06-11 15:16:54 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Liz Dooley">
<P>This review may also be subject to bias because although we have now included 17 trials and 5099 participants, it is possible that some patient subgroups are under-represented, as they may not have been recruited into the original trials. <LINK REF="STD-Little-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Little 2013</LINK> points out that while they included a large sample of older people, more severely ill older people with multimorbidities were unlikely to have been approached to participate in the trial, and in these types of patients their results should be interpreted with caution; this applies to the review results also.</P>
</POTENTIAL_BIASES>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2017-06-13 08:38:34 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Liz Dooley">
<P>In the current update of the review we have included a large multi country trial that shows no benefits from antibiotics even in older patients. Further analyses of the data from this study are ongoing as part of Workpackage 10 of the GRACE program (<A HREF="http://www.grace-lrti.org">www.grace-lrti.org</A>). It should be noted that a recent large observational study examining symptom resolution in 2714 people with acute cough who had been prescribed amoxicillin across 13 European countries found that symptom resolution was quicker in those receiving no antibiotic (<LINK REF="REF-Butler-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Butler 2010</LINK>).</P>

</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2017-06-11 15:17:06 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Liz Dooley">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2017-06-11 15:17:06 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Liz Dooley">
<P>This review confirms the impression of clinicians that antibiotics have limited, if any, beneficial effects in acute bronchitis. Where there appear to be some benefits, they are slight (such as the small improvement in mean duration of cough of less than one day) and may be of questionable clinical significance. The most recently published placebo-controlled randomised controlled trial confirms these findings and was carried out in 12 countries, improving the generalisability of the review findings (<LINK REF="STD-Little-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Little 2013</LINK>). Another recent randomised controlled trial included also showed no difference in cure rates between those prescribed amoxicillin and those given placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Nduba-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Nduba 2008</LINK>). This trial was particularly important as it was set in a low-income country and may increase the generalisability of the review. However, the inclusion of a range of trials in different settings does also increase heterogeneity.</P>
<P>While this review suggests limited if any clinical benefit from antibiotics, one could argue for prescribing antibiotics for acute bronchitis because studies of patient utilities for antibiotic treatment for respiratory infections suggest that even small benefits are seen as important by some patients (<LINK REF="REF-Herman-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Herman 1984</LINK>), and because the adverse effects associated with antibiotic treatment are minor and disappear when the medication is discontinued. On the other hand, arguments against prescribing antibiotics can be made because the modest benefits from antibiotics may not outweigh their costs, adverse effects, or negative consequences on antibiotic resistance patterns and patient expectations.</P>
<P>It is likely that, as with other respiratory infections (<LINK REF="REF-Dagnelie-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dagnelie 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kaiser-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Kaiser 1996</LINK>), antibiotics may be only effective for a subset of patients with acute bronchitis. It seems that patients who have other typical symptoms of an upper respiratory tract infection and who have been ill for less than one week may be the least likely to benefit from antibiotics. A large cohort study within the UK General Practice Research Database indicates that the risk of pneumonia as a complication of lower respiratory tract infection is substantially reduced in elderly patients when antibiotics are prescribed immediately (<LINK REF="REF-Petersen-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Petersen 2007</LINK>). However, a likely confounding factor in this study was the fact that sicker patients and those more likely to suffer complications were offered immediate antibiotics, introducing potential bias (<LINK REF="REF-Coenen-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Coenen 2007</LINK>). Another analysis of existing data suggests that reducing antibiotic prescribing for acute respiratory tract infections in primary care settings by 10% would be associated with one extra case of pneumonia per general practitioner every four to five years (<LINK REF="REF-Del-Mar-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Del Mar 2016</LINK>). The trials that have been performed to date do not offer a clear method to differentiate patients with acute bronchitis who might benefit from antibiotic therapy from those who might not. In light of this uncertainty, it is especially important for clinicians to share the decision about whether to use antibiotics or not with their patients, using the expected outcomes and their magnitude from this review as a basis for their discussion.</P>
<P>In terms of interventions designed to reduce unnecessary antibiotic prescribing, some organisational and educational strategies have been shown to be helpful. Use of delayed or deferred antibiotic when patients consult with symptoms of acute bronchitis is of some value (<LINK REF="STD-Dowell-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Dowell 2001</LINK>). In a randomised trial in 22 UK practices, 191 patients were randomised to either immediate or delayed antibiotic (prescription lodged at the family practice reception and patients were invited to collect it after one week, if required). Over half (55%) in the delayed arm did not pick up their prescriptions, though compared to the participants in the immediate arm, they were less satisfied with this strategy (<LINK REF="STD-Dowell-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Dowell 2001</LINK>). In a randomised trial of a patient information leaflet in 212 patients with acute bronchitis for whom antibiotics were judged to be unnecessary by their family doctor, the leaflet reduced uptake compared to those without any information (49% versus 63%, risk ratio 0.76) (<LINK REF="REF-Macfarlane-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Macfarlane 2002</LINK>). This review contains a subgroup of patients from a UK trial that tested the effectiveness of three prescribing strategies and an information leaflet for acute lower respiratory tract infections (<LINK REF="STD-Little-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Little 2005</LINK>). The authors concluded that no offer or a delayed offer of antibiotics for acute uncomplicated lower respiratory tract infection is acceptable and is associated with little difference in symptom resolution. The authors argue that the strategy of delayed or no prescribing is very likely to reduce antibiotic use and beliefs in the effectiveness of antibiotics for this condition. A recent review concluded that complex interventions that included education for physicians were most likely to be effective in optimising antibiotic prescribing in primary care settings (<LINK REF="REF-van-der-Velden-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">van der Velden 2012</LINK>).</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2017-06-06 15:31:22 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is a widespread belief among clinicians and patients that antibiotics provide effective treatment for acute bronchitis. There is also widespread opinion among experts that antibiotic therapy is unwarranted in this condition. The results of this review indicate that there are, at most, limited benefits for some patients, and this must be placed in the context of the significant increase in adverse events in the antibiotic group. However, it is also possible that any apparent benefits from antibiotics are overestimated.</P>
<P>Ongoing research efforts should also be directed at the identification of subsets of patients who are most likely or least likely to benefit from antibiotic treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Coenen-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Coenen 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Little-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Little 2013</LINK>). Patient age, duration and severity of illness, chest examination findings, sputum Gram stains, C-reactive protein levels (<LINK REF="REF-Jonsson-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jonsson 1997</LINK>), and cigarette smoking are variables that may be important in differentiation of these patient subsets. The ongoing GRACE programme (Genomics to Combat Resistance Against Antibiotics in Community-Acquired Lower Respiratory Tract Infections in Europe, <A HREF="http://www.grace-lrti.org">www.grace-lrti.org</A>) may provide answers to some of these questions (<LINK REF="REF-Coenen-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Coenen 2007</LINK>). Given the controversy around the term 'acute bronchitis', it will also be important for researchers to be very clear on their inclusion criteria to allow comparison across studies. Finally, given the small impact, at best, of antibiotics on patient symptoms, investigators should continue the search for other effective means of relieving the most troublesome symptoms of people suffering from acute bronchitis.</P>

<P>185 participants with acute respiratory tract infection from 2 health centres in Jordan. Assignment to antibiotic (azithromycin) was by means of alternation, not randomisation.

<P>Randomised controlled trial concerned with application of a diagnostic test (serum calcitonin precursor, procalcitonin) that is raised in bacterial infections. 243 people admitted to hospital with suspected lower respiratory tract infections were randomly assigned to standard care (n = 119) or procalcitonin-guided treatment (n = 124). On the basis of serum procalcitonin concentrations, use of antibiotics was more or less discouraged (&lt; 0.1 µg/L or &lt; 0.25 µg/L) or encouraged (&#8805; 0.5 µg/L or &#8805; 0.25 µg/L), respectively. Re-evaluation was possible after 6 to 24 hours in both groups. Primary endpoint was use of antibiotics. 59 (24%) participants had diagnosis of "acute bronchitis". Antibiotic use decreased in the procalcitonin group. Withholding antibiotic treatment based on procalcitonin measurement did not compromise patient outcome.</P>

<P>We would like to draw attention to the misleading statement of authors conclusions for this review. The authors conclusion in the abstract reads: "Overall, antibiotics appear to have a modest beneficial effect in patients who are diagnosed with acute bronchitis. THE MAGNITUDE OF THIS BENEFIT, HOWEVER, IS SIMILAR TO THAT OF THE DETRIMENT FROM POTENTIAL ADVERSE EFFECTS."</P>
<P>The data reported on adverse effects does not seem to support this conclusion.</P>
<P>Graph 07 showing the number of participants with adverse effects in the antibiotics and control groups illustrates that adverse events in the antibiotics group reach significance in just one small study (King 1996), and the non-significant pooled estimate is clearly stated in the results section: "The overall relative risk (RR) of adverse effects was 1.22 (95% CI 0.94 to 1.58)."</P>
<P>We would like to recommend that the authors amend their conclusions to take account of these comments.<BR/>Paul Garner and Helen Smith<BR/>

<P>We accept that our conclusions are overly pessimistic about side effects from antibiotic therapy. The pooled results from the updated review changed after inclusion of an additional RCT (<LINK REF="STD-Matthys-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Matthys 2000</LINK>, see <LINK REF="FIG-08" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 8</LINK> of the review), making adverse events less likely. We acknowledge that we did not change the tone of our conclusions to reflect this greater uncertainty concerning side effects.</P>
<P>We have amended the conclusion in the abstract to reflect the updated results concerning side effects to the following sentence:</P>
<P>"The magnitude of this benefit, however, needs to be considered in the broader context of potential side effects, medicalisation for a self-limiting condition, increased resistance to respiratory pathogens and cost of antibiotic treatment."</P>

<FEEDBACK_SUMMARY MODIFIED="2016-08-29 08:24:50 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Liz Dooley">
<P>Dear Authors,<BR/>Compared to the version published in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews 2002, issue 2, the current version of the review included two more studies (Matthys, 2000; Evans, 2003). By consequence, some comparisons (02, 04-07) were updated. Therefore, the abstract should start with "Eleven studies involving over 1250 patients" instead of "Nine trials involving over 750". But, more importantly, except for comparison 07: Adverse effects, the values of the comparisons already mentioned in the abstract still need to be adjusted, i.e. 05: Not improved by physician's global assessment at follow-up visit (RR 0.44; 95% CI 0.30,0.65; NNT 10; 95% CI ...) instead of (RR 0.52; 95% CI 0.31,0.85; NNT 14; 95% CI 8 to 50);06: Abnormal lung exam at follow-up visit (RR 0.54; 95% CI 0.41,0.70; NNT 6; 95% CI ...) instead of (RR 0.48; 95% CI 0.26,0.89; NNT 11; 95% CI 6 to 50); Finally, due to the inclusion of (Matthys, 2000) comparison 02: Night cough at follow-up visit, now shows a significant difference between antibiotics and placebo(RR 0.67; 95% CI 0.54,0.83; NNT 7 ; 95% CI ...) instead of (RR 0.76; 95% CI 0.45,1.30). This comparison should thus be removed from the statement starting with "There were nog significant differences regarding the presence of night cough, productive cough, ..." and added to the previous sentence showing the benefits of antibiotic treatment. Given the difficulties in distinguishing upper from lower respiratory tract infections in daily practice and given the results of the study by Little et al. mentioned as ongoing study, the conclusions are still justified.<BR/>

<P>Thank you for your comments regarding inconsistencies noted in the previous update of the review. The review has been updated again over the last nine months and these inconsistencies were noted and corrected. The Little study has since been published and is now incorporated in this new version of the review.</P>

<P>We have read your 2014 Cochrane review CD000245 "Antibiotics in Acute Bronchitis" in detail with interest and noticed two points:</P>
<P>1. In the published version on the Cochrane Library homepage we are not able to see Figure 1, which unfortunately seems to be missing in the document.</P>
<P>2. There seems to be a data-reference disorder:<BR/>In the text on page 12 concerning additional cases of adverse events it is written "NNT = 5, RR = 1.20 (1.05 to 1.36)", but in the abstract this is citated "NNT = 24, RR = 1.20 (1.05 to 1.36)"; ie the same RR-value and 95% CI, but very different NNT.</P>

<P>Regarding comment 1: Figure 1 has been reported to the Cochrane Library publishers and we have sought assistance to resolve this and move the Figure to the correct section.</P>
<P>Regarding comment 2: the NNT in the text was an error &#8211; I have corrected this.</P>
