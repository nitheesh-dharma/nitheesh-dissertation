<BACKGROUND>
<P>Dyspnoea, exercise limitation, and cough are common and distressing symptoms in terminally ill patients with chronic lung disease. These symptoms result from multiple causes, are difficult to treat and are a significant precipitating factor for late-stage hospital or hospice admissions. Nebulized morphine has been reported by some to improve dyspnoea and exercise limitation (<LINK REF="STD-Young-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Young 1989</LINK>), while others have found no significant effect (<LINK REF="REF-Masood-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Masood 1995</LINK>). The mechanism by which opioids might produce this effect is not clear (<LINK REF="REF-Zebraski-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zebraski 2000</LINK>). While obstructive disease can sometimes be associated with an increase in arterial carbon dioxide, due to hypoventilation thus making use of morphine undesirable, this is seldom the case in restrictive disease. It follows that patients with end-stage interstitial lung disease could be prime candidates for treatment of dyspnoea with nebulized morphine. There are also beneficial side effects to this treatment, as patients might also experience a reduction in cough (<LINK REF="REF-Loos-1973" TYPE="REFERENCE">Loos 1973</LINK>) and the treatment may have some immune modulating effects (<LINK REF="REF-Coussons_x002d_Read-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Coussons-Read 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>The aim of this review is to evaluate the effectiveness of using nebulized morphine for dyspnoea reduction in patients with interstitial lung disease (ILD). </P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>To determine the efficacy for using nebulized morphine in patients with dyspnoea due to ILD.</P>

<P>We identified 43 citations from the original searches conducted on CENTRAL, MEDLINE and EMBASE. After careful scrutiny, 36 articles were excluded because they were irrelevant (case reports, reviews, work on oral or IV morphine, basic science studies, surgical investigations, studies on irrelevant drugs and on morphine toxicity). We only identified seven potentially relevant articles. An additional search conducted in May 2009 did not identify any additional studies, while the search in May 2011 identified nine references, none of which were eligible for inclusion.</P>

<P>Only one study was identified which met the inclusion criteria for this review (<LINK REF="STD-Harris_x002d_Eze-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Harris-Eze 1995</LINK>). Six patients with a mild to moderate form of ILD were included in this randomised double-blind crossover, placebo controlled study. Three participants had IPF, two had scleroderma, one had sarcoidosis. A histologically proven diagnosis was obtained for three of the participants. The participants were clinically stable (no change in medication for at least two months) and without other major causes of dyspnoea such as obstructive airways disease, malignancy, congestive cardiac failure, recent pulmonary embolism, neuromuscular or rheumatologic diseases. Although it was unclear if the included participants were hypoxaemic at rest, significant arterial oxygen desaturation after exertion was reported (SaO2 desaturation of 12 ± 6%). Forced vital capacity (FVC), FEV1, and DLCO were approximately 70%, 74%, and 51% predicted respectively. The study compared on three different occasion the effect of 2.5 and 5.0 mg nebulized morphine to a control (normal saline) administered 30 min before maximal incremental cycle ergometer tests. The outcome variables were exercise duration, maximal workload, resting, submaximal, or end-exercise measurements of oxygen uptake (VO2), carbon dioxide output (VCO2), end-tidal CO2 (PETCO2), oxygen saturation (SaO2), minute ventilation (VI), respiratory frequency (f), tidal volume (VT), heart rate (HR), and sense of dyspnoea at the end of exercise. Evaluation of cough was not addressed in this study.</P>

<P>We excluded a further six mainly on the basis of subject selection. The most recent study (<LINK REF="REF-Noseda-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Noseda 1997</LINK>) was primarily carried out in participants with COPD and lung cancer with the exception of one participant with ILD (her individual data showed that nebulized morphine had no effect). Two other papers (<LINK REF="STD-Young-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Young 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Leung-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Leung 1996</LINK>) had similar limitations; the majority of participants investigated had COPD with the exception of one ILD participants in <LINK REF="STD-Leung-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Leung 1996</LINK> and two participants with ILD in <LINK REF="STD-Young-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Young 1989</LINK> (their individual data showed that nebulized morphine had little or no effect). <LINK REF="STD-Allen-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Allen 2005</LINK> was a before and after study assessing breathlessness in people with ILD.</P>

<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
<P>In the only study identified (<LINK REF="STD-Harris_x002d_Eze-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Harris-Eze 1995</LINK>), no significant differences were noted in exercise duration, maximal workload, or sense of dyspnoea at the end of exercise in the control test and the tests with either morphine 2.5 mg or morphine 5.0 mg. There were no significant differences noted in resting, submaximal, or end-exercise measurements of oxygen uptake (VO2), carbon dioxide output (VCO2), end-tidal CO2 (PETCO2), oxygen saturation (SaO2), minute ventilation (VI), respiratory frequency (f), tidal volume (VT), or heart rate (HR) in the three tests. Low-dose nebulized morphine did not alter the participants' breathing pattern or affect the relationship between dyspnoea and ventilation during exercise. No significant side effects were noted.</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2011-05-25 17:53:58 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">
<P>There has been only one randomised study evaluating the effectiveness of using nebulized morphine for dyspnoea reduction in participants with interstitial lung disease (<LINK REF="STD-Harris_x002d_Eze-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Harris-Eze 1995</LINK>) and this only looked at exercise induced and not resting dyspnoea. Although anecdotal evidence indicates that nebulized morphine reduces cough in patients with advanced lung disease (<LINK REF="STD-Quelch-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Quelch 1997</LINK>), this was not addressed in the present study.</P>
<P>The results of this study show that compared with placebo, administration of low-dose nebulized morphine to six patients with ILD did not improve maximal exercise performance, and did not reduce dyspnoea during exercise. The main problems with this study are:</P>
<OL>
<LI>Small sample size (only six patients were included). This is a problem considering the wide variability of some of the end-points measured, such as the Borg scores for dyspnoea.</LI>
<LI>It appears that significant dyspnoea was not present at rest in the participants studied.</LI>
<LI>The participants included were mildly affected and NOT end-stage, where palliative measures would be needed.</LI>
</OL>
<P>On the basis of the non-randomised evidence available, nebulized morphine did appear to reduce disabling dyspnoea in patients with advanced lung disease (<LINK REF="STD-Allen-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Allen 2005</LINK>). Thus, it is possible that the lack of effect of nebulized morphine in the study by <LINK REF="STD-Harris_x002d_Eze-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Harris-Eze 1995</LINK> could be due to a low degree of dyspnoea, which may not be sensitive enough to nebulized morphine. In COPD, nebulized morphine fails to attenuate dyspnoea during exercise (<LINK REF="REF-Masood-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Masood 1995</LINK>) whereas a study in COPD patients with disabling dyspnoea concluded that nebulized morphine significantly attenuates symptoms (<LINK REF="STD-Young-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Young 1989</LINK>).</P>
<P>Reduction of important dyspnoea by nebulized morphine in patients with interstitial lung disease remains to be evaluated.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>Currently, one cannot conclude that nebulized morphine is effective in reducing dyspnoea in end-stage interstitial lung disease.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>More trials of reasonable quality are required. These studies should assess breathlessness on validated scales, they should be conducted in people with end-stage disease and should recruit large numbers of participants. </P>
