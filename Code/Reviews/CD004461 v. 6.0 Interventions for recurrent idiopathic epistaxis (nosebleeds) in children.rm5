<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2012-07-31 16:41:17 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Nosebleeds in children usually just stop by themselves or after pinching the nose. However, some children get repeated nosebleeds with no specific cause (recurrent idiopathic epistaxis). The most common treatments are cautery or antiseptic cream, or both. Cautery (a method of sealing) can be painful even with local anaesthetic, and usually involves using a silver nitrate stick to seal off a visible blood vessel inside the nose that may be rupturing. Other options include ointments and nasal sprays. The review of trials found that there is not enough evidence to compare the effectiveness of different treatment options, however using a lower concentration of silver nitrate cautery is more effective in the short term and less painful. More research is needed to show the best options for reducing recurrent nosebleeds of unknown cause in children.</P>

<P>Recurrent idiopathic epistaxis (nosebleeds) in children is repeated nasal bleeding in patients up to the age of 16 for which no specific cause has been identified. Although nosebleeds are very common in children, and most cases are self limiting or settle with simple measures (such as pinching the nose), more severe recurrent cases can require treatment from a healthcare professional. However, there is no consensus on the effectiveness of the different clinical interventions currently used in managing this condition.</P>

<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To assess the effects of different interventions for the management of recurrent idiopathic epistaxis in children.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2012-07-31 16:39:00 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Ear, Nose and Throat Disorders Group Trials Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); PubMed; EMBASE; CINAHL; Web of Science; BIOSIS Previews; Cambridge Scientific Abstracts; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the most recent search was 5 March 2012.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2012-07-31 15:22:25 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We identified all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) (with or without blinding) in which any surgical or medical intervention for the treatment of recurrent idiopathic epistaxis in children was evaluated in comparison with either no treatment, a placebo or another intervention, and in which the frequency and severity of episodes of nasal bleeding following treatment was stated or calculable. The two authors reviewed the full-text articles of all retrieved trials of possible relevance and applied the inclusion criteria independently.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2012-07-31 15:23:42 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We graded trials for risk of bias using the Cochrane approach. One author performed data extraction in a standardised manner and this was rechecked by the other author. Where necessary we contacted investigators to obtain missing information. We did not undertake a meta-analysis because of the heterogeneity of the treatments, procedures and quality of the included trials. A narrative overview of the results is therefore presented.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-07-31 16:38:26 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Five studies (four RCTs and one quasi-randomised controlled trial) involving 468 participants satisfied the inclusion criteria. The identified RCTs compared 0.5% neomycin + 0.1% chlorhexidine (Naseptin®) cream with no treatment, Vaseline® petroleum jelly with no treatment, 75% with 95% silver nitrate nasal cautery, and silver nitrate cautery combined with Naseptin® against Naseptin® alone; the quasi-randomised controlled trial compared Naseptin® antiseptic cream with silver nitrate cautery. Overall results were inconclusive, with no statistically significant difference found between the compared treatments upon completion of the trials, however 75% silver nitrate was more effective than 95% silver nitrate at two weeks following application. The group treated with 75% silver nitrate had 88% complete resolution of epistaxis compared to 65% in the group treated with 95% silver nitrate (P = 0.01). No serious adverse effects were reported from any of the interventions, although children receiving silver nitrate cautery reported that it was a painful experience (despite the use of local anaesthetic). The pain scores were significantly less in those treated with 75% silver nitrate, the mean score being 1 compared to a mean score of 5 in those treated with 95% silver nitrate; this was statistically significant (P = 0.001).</P>
<P>We carried out a 'Risk of bias' assessment of each study according to the Cochrane methodology and judged that two randomised controlled trials had a low risk of bias, two had an unclear risk of bias and the quasi-randomised controlled trial had a high risk of bias.</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2012-07-10 12:24:14 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The optimal management of children with recurrent idiopathic epistaxis is unknown, however if silver nitrate nasal cautery is undertaken 75% is preferable to 95% as it is more effective in the short term and causes less pain. High-quality randomised controlled trials comparing interventions either with placebo or no treatment, and with a follow-up period of at least a year, are needed to assess the relative merits of the various treatments currently in use.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2012-07-31 16:41:42 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Recurrent idiopathic epistaxis in children is repeated, self limiting nasal bleeding in patients up to the age of 16 for which no specific cause has been identified. Epistaxis is defined as acute bleeding from the nostril, nasal cavity or nasopharynx. Recurrent episodes are a source of significant distress and anxiety in children, their carers and clinicians, with the result that such nosebleeds are a common cause of morbidity and hospital referral. Currently there is no consensus on the frequency or severity of recurrences that mandates further treatment (<LINK REF="REF-McGarry-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">McGarry 2008</LINK>).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Prevalence</HEADING>
<P>Epistaxis is very common in children, although it is rare before two years of age. Thirty per cent of all children aged 0 to 5 years, 56% of those aged 6 to 10 years, and 64% of those aged 11 to 15 years have had at least one episode of epistaxis in their lifetime (<LINK REF="REF-Petruson-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Petruson 1979</LINK>), while 56% of adults with recurrent nosebleeds had problems in childhood (<LINK REF="REF-Beran-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beran 1986</LINK>). In most children the bleeding stops spontaneously, but children with severe or recurrent bleeds may need hospital treatment. In 1979, Petruson in Sweden estimated the number of children consulting an ENT specialist due to epistaxis per 1000 children per year as 0.5 in the 0 to 5-year age group and 1.6 in the 6 to 10-year age group (<LINK REF="REF-Petruson-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Petruson 1979</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Aetiology</HEADING>
<P>Epistaxis is classified as anterior or posterior depending upon the primary bleeding site and is thought to be more common in males (<LINK REF="REF-Sengupta-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sengupta 2010</LINK>). Anterior epistaxis is more common in children and young adults, whereas posterior nasal bleeding is more often seen in older adults with hypertension or arteriosclerosis (<LINK REF="REF-Watkinson-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Watkinson 1997</LINK>). In the majority of children, spontaneous haemorrhage is almost always venous and originates from Little's area, the anterior region of the nasal septum, where a number of arteries anastomose with each other forming a plexus of vessels (Kiesselbach's plexus) under the thin mucosa. Bleeding often results when this region is exposed to dry air or minor trauma. The subsequent crusts and scabs can then cause itching, which in turn leads children to traumatise the area again by picking and rubbing.</P>
<P>Childhood recurrent idiopathic epistaxis is usually attributed to crusting, nasal vestibulitis (an infection of the skin of the nasal vestibule producing soreness, inflammation, fissuring and encrustation) and/or digital trauma ('nose picking'), although in many cases no direct cause can be established (<LINK REF="REF-Guarisco-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guarisco 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McGarry-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">McGarry 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Petruson-1974" TYPE="REFERENCE">Petruson 1974</LINK>). <I>Staphylococcus aureus</I> may have a role in this process; its colonisation of the nasal cavity is thought to produce a chronic low-grade inflammation resulting in septal neovascularisation which, along with irritation and digital trauma, may explain the sequence of events resulting in recurrent epistaxis (<LINK REF="REF-Montague-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Montague 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>The incidence of idiopathic epistaxis in all ages is thought to be highest during the colder winter months in northern climates, when upper respiratory tract infections (a frequent precursor to episodes of epistaxis) are more frequent and when indoor humidity decreases to low levels at both home and in the work place (<LINK REF="REF-Nunez-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nunez 1990</LINK>). Changes from a cold outside environment to a warm dry one may cause variations of the normal nasal cycle of alternating congestion and decongestion, which can then lead to sinonasal congestion, engorgement of the nasal mucosa and ultimately epistaxis. Airborne environmental pollutants are thought to increase the incidence of epistaxis (<LINK REF="REF-Bray-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bray 2004</LINK>). Epistaxis is also more common in hot dry climates with low humidity, however this view is not universal as work has suggested temperature to have no causal relationship with epistaxis (<LINK REF="REF-Bray-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bray 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>Patients who suffer from allergic rhinitis are more prone to epistaxis because the nasal mucosa is more inflamed and friable (<LINK REF="REF-Watkinson-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Watkinson 1997</LINK>). In only a small number of cases can epistaxis in children be attributed to a well-defined primary cause, for example a blood dyscrasia (a problem with blood clotting), a blood vessel abnormality (such as telangiectatic vessels in Little's area), a viral infection (such as dengue haemorrhagic fever, a mosquito-borne viral disease which sometimes presents with a few days of recurrent epistaxis) or vestibulitis. In the majority of cases, bleeding arises from a normal vein (or, occasionally, an artery) without any obvious abnormality to account for it. The terms 'spontaneous' or 'idiopathic' epistaxis have therefore been used to describe this most common category of epistaxis.</P>
<P>It should be noted that occasionally tumours such as juvenile angiofibroma may present as epistaxis (especially in teenage boys), as may certain bleeding disorders, such as von Willebrand's disease, haemophilia or idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, the latter being the most common systemic cause of epistaxis. Studies suggest that as many as 5% to 10% of children with recurrent nosebleeds may have mild, previously undiagnosed von Willebrand's disease (<LINK REF="REF-Katsanis-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Katsanis 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kiley-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kiley 1982</LINK>). Hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia may also present in this way. Nevertheless, for more than 90% of all paediatric patients with epistaxis, there is no underlying systemic cause.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Management</HEADING>
<P>Most children's nosebleeds are self limiting or settle with simple measures such as pinching the nose, but more severe recurrent cases require treatment from a health professional. There is no consensus on how frequent or severe recurrences need to be to warrant such treatment. Once a careful history has been taken to exclude bleeding secondary to systemic disease, direct examination (with or without a flexible or rigid endoscope) usually reveals an engorged vessel on the septum (<LINK REF="REF-Watkinson-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Watkinson 1997</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2012-07-31 16:45:06 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The most common interventions used to treat idiopathic recurrent nosebleeds in children are cautery of visible vessels on the anterior part of the nasal septum (usually with a silver nitrate stick under local anaesthetic) and/or the application of an antiseptic nasal cream in order to reduce vestibulitis and crusting. Silver nitrate acts as an oxidising agent. In an aqueous solution the silver cation of the salt (Ag(I)) is readily reduced to neutral silver metal (Ag(O)) which precipitates, resulting in free radicals. The chemical stress associated with this reaction oxidises organic tissue. Two commercially available concentrations of silver nitrate (75% and 95%) are used by otolaryngologists for the treatment of epistaxis. The silver nitrate is supplied in the form of tips fused with potassium nitrate onto thin plastic handles (<LINK REF="STD-Glynn-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Glynn 2011</LINK>). It remains unknown whether the use of the stronger 95% preparation has any benefit over the 75% preparation (<LINK REF="STD-Glynn-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Glynn 2011</LINK>), however studies have shown 95% silver nitrate to be associated with greater tissue damage and a higher potential for complications (<LINK REF="REF-Amin-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Amin 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>Other treatments include the instillation of nasal saline spray to moisten the nasal cavity and prevent excessive drying and crusting (<LINK REF="REF-Wurman-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wurman 1992</LINK>), or the use of bland oils or ointments (in particular petroleum jelly) to cover the mucosa and blood vessels and thereby prevent them from becoming dry and friable. These are frequently advocated as initial treatments for less severe cases (e.g. <LINK REF="REF-Barelli-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barelli 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Watkinson-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Watkinson 1997</LINK>). Various other topical pharmacological agents have been advocated, including: oxymetazoline, a topical nasal decongestant (<LINK REF="REF-Krempl-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Krempl 1995</LINK>); intranasal sprays containing desmopressin, an anti-haemorrhagic agent (<LINK REF="REF-Lethagen-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lethagen 1993</LINK>); and epsilon-aminocaproic acid (<LINK REF="REF-Jash-1973" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jash 1973</LINK>) and tranexamic acid gel (<LINK REF="REF-Tibbelin-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tibbelin 1995</LINK>), both antifibrinolytic agents (i.e. agents that inhibit the dissolution of blood clots). An alternative treatment, fibrin sealant, has also been evaluated (<LINK REF="STD-Vaiman-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Vaiman 2002</LINK>). Galvanocautery (a form of electrocautery) under local anaesthetic is not recommended in children (<LINK REF="REF-Watkinson-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Watkinson 1997</LINK>) but can be performed under general anaesthetic using bipolar diathermy.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Adverse effects</HEADING>
<P>There remains no consensus concerning the effectiveness of these interventions. Silver nitrate cautery, in particular, can be painful for the patient and has been said to have a high failure rate (<LINK REF="REF-McGarry-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">McGarry 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ruddy-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Ruddy 1991</LINK>). Cautery is only useful when the site of bleeding is clearly visible and not bleeding too briskly. It relies on destroying the blood vessels with acid, causing them to be replaced by scar tissue (<LINK REF="STD-Murthy-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Murthy 1999</LINK>). However, it is possible for telangiectatic vessels to reappear at the margin of the cauterised area. Cautery causes sclerosis of the vessels and thickening of the mucosa, but in children with vestibulitis the bleeding often occurs from ulcerated nasal mucosa in the vestibule as the crusts break off, rather than from discrete vessels. Moreover, the itch resulting from crusting probably results in increased 'picking' of the nose, with resulting trauma and delay in healing, while toxins produced by bacteria colonising the nose may also contribute to further bleeding. As a result, cautery of such areas is likely to delay healing, and will not help to relieve vestibulitis.</P>
<P>Despite its popularity, cautery of the septum also carries the risk of atrophy of the nasal mucosa which can lead to septal crusting and perforation (particularly in children), and can result in other adverse effects, including mucocutaneous reaction and tattooing of the septal mucosa (<LINK REF="REF-Mayall-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mayall 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Murthy-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Murthy 1996</LINK>). The drugs used to produce local anaesthesia preceding cautery, especially cocaine, carry well-established risks of adverse effects (<LINK REF="STD-Murthy-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Murthy 1999</LINK>). In many countries the use of cocaine has been replaced by the use of less potentially toxic local anaesthetic and decongestant agents. The application of antiseptic nasal cream is less traumatic, but may also fail to relieve the vestibulitis because of habitual nose picking and recolonisation of the nose with bacteria (<LINK REF="STD-Ruddy-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Ruddy 1991</LINK>).</P>

<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2012-02-02 11:55:20 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Treatment of recurrent epistaxis in children is somewhat simplified by the fact that the source of bleeding for the vast majority of cases is from the anterior septum, and by the fact that no specialised equipment is required for diagnosis and treatment. Most paediatric patients - unless actively bleeding - can therefore be effectively managed on an outpatient basis. Nevertheless, management continues to pose a problem for both general practitioners and otolaryngologists, in part because no single method of treatment has achieved universal acceptance. A systematic review of published clinical trials of interventions for recurrent epistaxis in children is therefore presented, using established meta-analytical techniques.</P>

<P>The original searches in August 2003 retrieved 726 references, of which 717 were immediately considered unsuitable for inclusion. The majority of these considered epistaxis only as a side effect and the others were either review articles, descriptive studies or uncontrolled trials. Of the nine possibly relevant studies, two trials included adults only (<LINK REF="STD-Morra-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Morra 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tang-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Tang 2001</LINK>), and two trials that included both adults and children were excluded (after having contacted the authors), as paediatric data only proved impossible to extract (<LINK REF="STD-Murthy-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Murthy 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vaiman-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Vaiman 2002</LINK>). We excluded two further trials as they were not randomised and so were not of sufficient methodological quality (<LINK REF="STD-Tarantino-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Tarantino 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ye-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Ye 1997</LINK>). Three trials satisfied all aspects of our inclusion criteria (<LINK REF="STD-Kubba-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Kubba 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Loughran-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Loughran 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ruddy-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Ruddy 1991</LINK>). Searching the bibliographies of all relevant papers did not reveal any further trials. The methods, participants, interventions and outcomes of the included studies are listed in the table of <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>.</P>
<P>Update searches performed in October 2007 retrieved a further 933 references once duplicates were removed, of which 929 were considered unsuitable for inclusion. Four references were investigated further. Of these, <LINK REF="STD-Vyas-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Vyas 2006</LINK>, a randomised controlled trial comparing Vaseline®, antiseptic cream (Naseptin®) and silver nitrate cautery in 205 children, satisfied all our inclusion criteria, but the paper is a conference abstract in which insufficient data are presented. Although contact was made with one of the co-authors (J Dempster), he was able to provide neither additional data nor contact details for the study's lead author. As a result, the study has therefore been placed in the <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_AWAITING_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of studies awaiting classification</LINK> section in the hope that data will be available for inclusion in a future update of this review. For the latest update of this review in 2012, further attempts to gain more information or contact the lead author were unsuccessful. The remaining three references proved to be: a follow-up study (Robertson 2007, published as a conference abstract) to an already included study (<LINK REF="STD-Kubba-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Kubba 2001</LINK>), and two references to an ongoing study completed in 2008 (Kubba 2006); this has now been included in the latest update (<LINK REF="STD-Calder-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Calder 2009</LINK>). Perusal of Robertson 2007 suggests that this is not a report of a randomised controlled trial nor of the long-term effects of the original (randomised) interventions; rather, the children included in the original trial were the subjects of long-term follow-up to examine the effectiveness of the interventions they underwent at their eight-week clinic appointment in 2001, which were not randomly allocated (see below).</P>
<P>We again updated the searches in November 2009, July 2011 and March 2012, retrieving a total of 583 references. We removed 575 of these in first-level screening (i.e. removal of duplicates and clearly irrelevant references), leaving eight references for further consideration. An additional two studies met all inclusion criteria for the review (<LINK REF="STD-Calder-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Calder 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Glynn-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Glynn 2011</LINK>).

<P>The trial compared nasal cautery and antiseptic nasal cream to antiseptic cream alone in the management of paediatric epistaxis. Upon agreeing to participate patients were randomised using sequentially numbered, sealed, shuffled envelopes. Fifty-four were allocated to the treatment group (silver nitrate and antiseptic cream) and 55 to the control group (antiseptic cream). Pre-trial duration of symptoms for all referred patients ranged from one month to nine years; the majority had symptoms for at least a year. The mean age was 7.4 (range 1 to 13 years) and frequency of bleeding ranged from six times a day to monthly. Both treatment and control groups underwent preparation of the nasal mucosa with lignocaine either as a spray (2%) or on a cotton wool pledget (4%); the treatment group then underwent nasal cautery with 75% silver nitrate to any visible vessels on the nasal septum whilst the control group underwent 'sham' cautery using the inactive end of the cautery stick. Both groups were asked to apply 0.5% neomycin + 0.1% chlorhexidine cream (Naseptin®) twice daily to the effected side for four weeks.</P>

<P>The trial compared the effectiveness of 75% versus 95% silver nitrate cauterisation for the management of idiopathic childhood epistaxis. Children were randomised prior to commencing the study using randomly allocated sealed envelopes: 50 (49 completing the trial) to group A treated with 75% silver nitrate and 53 (52 completing the trial) to group B treated with 95% silver nitrate. The frequency of epistaxis ranged from 4 to 20 episodes per month with a mean of five per month; there was no significant difference in the frequency and duration of epistaxis between the two groups. The pre-cautery anaesthesia and method of application was identical, taking care to avoid surrounding normal mucosa. Following cautery both groups were given a prescription for 0.5% neomycin + 0.1% chlorhexidine (Naseptin®) to apply to the cauterised site twice daily for two weeks. Initially children aged over six were asked to report pain on a visual analogue scale and parents asked to report pain on their children's behalf if aged under six. Parents and children were also asked to maintain a diary of any further epistaxis until their follow-up appointment in two weeks and then eight weeks following cautery.</P>

Participants were randomised by referral letter into two groups: 51 to the treatment group (47 completing the trial) and 52 to the control group (41 completing the trial). The frequency of pre-trial bleeds ranged from 1 to 90 per month (mean = 9) over a period of between 2 and 96 months (mean = 20).

The pre-trial duration of symptoms was between 2 and 84 months (median = 12), with bleeds lasting between 2 and 120 minutes (median = 5). The treatment group was instructed to apply petroleum jelly twice a day bilaterally for four weeks, to monitor any bleeds during a further four-week period, and to attend an eight-week outpatient appointment.

<P>At follow-up the diaries were reviewed and parents asked if their children had required any pain relief on the day of their cauterisation. Any patients that failed to attend outpatients were contacted by telephone and offered another appointment; information regarding further epistaxis was taken over the telephone if they failed to attend. One hundred and one patients attended for the two-week follow-up appointment and 93 for the eight-week follow-up appointment; the remaining eight were successfully contacted by telephone. Two patients failed to attend either appointment or be contactable via telephone (one from Group A and one from Group B).

There was also no randomisation method given, but when contacted one of the authors (David Proops) recalled that alternating patients were randomised at presentation, making this a quasi-randomised trial. No power calculations for correct sample sizes were apparently made, with the result that the sample size was too small to give the results of the trial sufficient weight (24 participants in each group, when by our calculations there should have been at least 53 per group for 80% power).<BR/>

<LINK REF="STD-Calder-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Calder 2009</LINK>
</P>
<P>This study compared the effectiveness of silver nitrate cautery and Naseptin® against Naseptin® cream alone for the treatment of recurrent epistaxis in children. The primary outcome measure was no bleeding in the four weeks following completion of treatment. The authors used an intention-to-treat analysis and reported no significant differences between the two groups (21 of 46 treatment and 14 of 47 control, P = 0.114). They also assessed difference in severity or frequency of bleeds: 42 (91.3%) of 46 in the treatment group compared to 33 (70.2%) of 47 had an improvement in these symptoms, which was statistically significant (P = 0.01). This study suggests that nasal cautery combined with Naseptin® is superior to Naseptin® alone in the treatment of recurrent idiopathic epistaxis when vessels are visible. This study was, however, underpowered by the authors own admission, making the results less meaningful.</P>

<P>This study compared the effectiveness of 75% silver nitrate (group A) with 95% silver nitrate (group B). In group A, 43 (88%) of 49 children had complete resolution of epistaxis; three underwent repeat cauterisation with the same concentration stick. At eight weeks, 48 (98%) of 49 had complete resolution; the one child without resolution was subsequently diagnosed with von Willebrand's disease. In group B initial follow-up showed resolution of epistaxis in 34 (65%) of 52 cases; six were re-cauterised with the same concentration stick. At eight weeks complete resolution had occurred in 47 (90%) of 52 children. One of these five children was subsequently diagnosed with von Willebrand's disease. The authors noted a statistically significant difference between groups A and B at two weeks (P = 0.01) but not at eight weeks (P = 0.12). This study suggests that nasal cautery with 75% silver nitrate is more effective at controlling recurrent epistaxis compared to 95% silver nitrate in the short term when followed up with Naseptin® cream, but there is little difference in the long term.</P>

Complete data were available for 88 (85.5%) participants: 21/47 (45%) in the treatment group (five of whom did not receive treatment as intended) with post-treatment bleeds, compared with 29/41 (71%) in the control group, giving a statistically significant difference in favour of Naseptin® (P = 0.01). From this per-protocol (i.e. complete case) analysis, the authors concluded that their study showed a significant short-term benefit in the use of antiseptic cream when compared to no treatment: "This equates to a relative risk reduction of 47%* (95% confidence interval 9% to 69%), and an absolute risk reduction of 26% for persistent bleeding (95% confidence interval 12% to 40%), giving a number needed to treat of 3.8 (95% confidence interval 2.5% to 8.5%)." (Kubba 2001, p.47) (*By our calculations this should read 37%).</P>
<P>However, an intention-to-treat analysis provided the following results: 21/51 (41%) in the treatment group with post-treatment bleeds, compared with 29/52 (56%) in the control group with post-treatment bleeds, with no statistically significant difference between the groups (P = 0.14). Two different sensitivity analyses confirm this result: i) a best-case scenario for both groups (i.e. assuming that all those lost to follow-up failed to attend the clinic because they had no post-treatment bleeds) gave an identical result to that of the intention-to-treat analysis; ii) a best-case scenario for no treatment (i.e. assuming that everyone lost from the treatment group had post-treatment bleeds, but everyone lost from the control group was clear of bleeds) gave 25/51 (49%) with bleeds in the treatment group, compared with 29/52 (56%) with bleeds in the control group, with no statistically significant difference between the groups (P = 0.49). Thus, as the authors themselves stated: "A large proportion (29%) of the children referred did not attend for their appointment...If failure to attend is more common in those whose symptoms have settled, it would tend to bias our results away from showing a significant difference."</P>
<P>Our intention-to-treat and sensitivity analyses show that in this trial there was no statistically significant difference between Naseptin® and no treatment.</P>

<P>This study compared antiseptic nasal carrier cream (Naseptin®) with silver nitrate cautery. In the Naseptin® group, 11/24 (45%) participants experienced post-treatment bleeds compared with 9/24 (38%) in the cautery group, with no statistically significant difference between treatments (P = 0.56). Three participants - one in the Naseptin® group, two in the cautery group - were lost to follow-up. This suggests that antiseptic nasal cream alone may be as effective as silver nitrate cautery alone in the treatment of recurrent epistaxis in childhood.</P>

<P>Pain scores in group A ranged from 0 to 5 with a mean of 1 and in group B from 1 to 9 with a mean of 5. This was considered statistically significant (P = 0.001). At two weeks an eschar was visible in two (4%) of 49 patients in group A and 15 (29%) of 52 in group B; these disappeared at eight weeks in both groups. There were no cases of tattooing or septal perforation in either group, but there was a case of a small adhesion between the nasal septum and inferior turbinate in group B.</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2012-07-31 16:38:29 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>No result from any of the five included trials showed any single treatment to be significantly better than either any other treatment or no treatment for recurrent idiopathic epistaxis in children upon completion of the trials.</P>
<P>The quality of three of the five studies was not high. Two studies had small sample sizes (<LINK REF="STD-Calder-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Calder 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ruddy-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Ruddy 1991</LINK>) and another had significant losses to follow-up (<LINK REF="STD-Kubba-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Kubba 2001</LINK>). In the two trials of high methodological quality Vaseline® was no better than no treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Loughran-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Loughran 2004</LINK>) and 75% silver nitrate cautery with Naseptin®, whilst better than 95% silver nitrate cautery with Naseptin® at two weeks, was no better at eight weeks (<LINK REF="STD-Glynn-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Glynn 2011</LINK>), therefore neither showed a significant difference between interventions upon completion of the studies.</P>
<P>A major weakness in all trials was the follow-up period of four (<LINK REF="STD-Calder-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Calder 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kubba-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Kubba 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Loughran-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Loughran 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ruddy-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Ruddy 1991</LINK>) and eight weeks (<LINK REF="STD-Glynn-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Glynn 2011</LINK>). We believe this is an insufficient period over which to evaluate the effectiveness of treatment of a recurrent and (generally) episodic condition.</P>
<P>It should be noted that both <LINK REF="STD-Kubba-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Kubba 2001</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Loughran-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Loughran 2004</LINK> adopted a rather unusual methodological approach to study enrolment. The trials were both undertaken in a hospital setting in which participants were randomised and admitted to the trials on receipt of a referral letter from a general practitioner (i.e. from primary care). This process took place prior to the patients (or carers) having given consent to the patients' participation in the trial, or indeed before they even knew a trial was being undertaken. Loughran states that there were both advantages and disadvantages to this approach: "The advantage is that it allowed the normal outpatient wait to act as a natural observation period for the control arm. It would have been difficult to get ethical or parental approval to assess a child and then send them away without treatment." This statement (which also appears, worded slightly differently, in <LINK REF="STD-Kubba-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Kubba 2001</LINK>) is questionable, however. If, in the study setting in question, it was "normal" to wait eight weeks for an outpatient appointment (and hence an eight-week treatment delay was usual and acceptable), then it would not have been unethical for patients to be sent away without treatment. Instead, some might question the concept of enrolling people in a trial without their prior knowledge and consent.</P>
<P>Furthermore, this enrolment method, as Loughran concedes, has its own problems: "The disadvantages are that occasionally the referral letter is misleading or even incorrect in its assumptions, and the fact that compliance rates may be higher if patients are initially seen at the clinic and the trial fully explained, and the chance to ask questions is given." Relying on a referral letter to assess the eligibility of patients means that no proper history is taken - as stated above, this is an important issue in the treatment of recurrent idiopathic epistaxis, as other causes for the condition should be ruled out before treatment is given. As a result, both trials had to exclude participants (five in <LINK REF="STD-Kubba-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Kubba 2001</LINK>, one in <LINK REF="STD-Loughran-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Loughran 2004</LINK>), although <LINK REF="STD-Kubba-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Kubba 2001</LINK> failed to record the reason for these exclusions.</P>
<P>The most notable results came from <LINK REF="STD-Ruddy-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Ruddy 1991</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Glynn-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Glynn 2011</LINK>. <LINK REF="STD-Ruddy-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Ruddy 1991</LINK> was the trial of lowest quality, which suggested that antiseptic cream may be as effective as silver nitrate cautery (a procedure generally perceived by participants in the trial as painful and unpleasant). However, this was a small study with low power. <LINK REF="STD-Glynn-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Glynn 2011</LINK> noted that 75% silver nitrate cautery with Naseptin® was more effective than 95% silver nitrate cautery and Naseptin® at two weeks (<LINK REF="STD-Glynn-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Glynn 2011</LINK>). Furthermore, it was better tolerated in terms of adverse outcomes, making 75% silver nitrate preferable to 95% silver nitrate during nasal cauterisation for paediatric idiopathic epistaxis.</P>

<P>The optimal management of children with recurrent idiopathic epistaxis remains unknown, however if chemical cautery is utilised 75% silver nitrate is preferable to 95% silver nitrate as it is more effective in the short term and less painful. Overall there appear to be no serious adverse effects associated with any of the treatments evaluated, although children receiving silver nitrate cautery commonly report the experience as painful (despite the use of local anaesthetic).</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2012-07-10 12:36:55 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>High-quality randomised controlled trials are needed to assess the relative merits of not only antiseptic cream and silver nitrate cautery, but also of other interventions currently in use for the treatment of idiopathic paediatric epistaxis (for example, nasal sprays, antifibrinolytic agents and bland oils or ointments). Some children with recurrent troublesome epistaxis undergo bipolar diathermy cauterisation under general anaesthesia; the merits of this, compared to alternatives, should also be evaluated. These studies should compare different interventions either with placebo or no treatment, be of sufficient quality and size, and have a follow-up period of at least a year. Data on the natural resolution rate of (severe) recurrent idiopathic epistaxis in children would also be helpful.</P>
