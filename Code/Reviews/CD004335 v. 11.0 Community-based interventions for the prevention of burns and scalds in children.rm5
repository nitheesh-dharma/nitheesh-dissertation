<SUMMARY>
<TITLE>Insufficient evidence so far to support the community approach to burns and scalds prevention</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Multi-strategy, community-based interventions are widely promoted for reducing injury rates. The efficacy of this approach is difficult to assess and there have been few research studies of good quality. The current review sought to review studies evaluating the success of community-based programmes specifically intended to reduce burn and scald injury in children. Only four studies were identified that met the inclusion criteria and two of these found a reduction in rates of burns and scalding. More high-quality research studies are needed in this area, therefore, to support the continued use of the community approach.</P>
</SUMMARY_BODY>
</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Burns and scalds are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in children. Successful counter-measures to prevent burn and scald-related injury have been identified. However, evidence indicating the successful roll-out of these counter-measures into the wider community is lacking. Community-based interventions in the form of multi-strategy, multi-focused programmes are hypothesised to result in a reduction in population-wide injury rates. This review tests this hypothesis with regards to burn and scald injury in children. </P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To assess the effects of community-based interventions, defined as coordinated, multi-strategy initiatives, for reducing burns and scalds in children aged 14 years and under.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>We searched the Cochrane Injuries Group's specialised register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, National Research Register and the Web of Knowledge. We also handsearched selected journals and checked the reference lists of selected publications. The searches were last updated in May 2007.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Included studies were those that reported changes in medically attended burn and scald-related injury rates in a paediatric population (aged 14 years and under), following the implementation of a controlled community-based intervention.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Two authors independently assess studies for eligibility and extracted data. Due to heterogeneity between the included studies, a pooled analysis was not appropriate.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Of 39 identified studies, four met the criteria for inclusion. Two of the included studies reported a significant decrease in paediatric burn and scald injury in the intervention compared with the control communities. The failure of the other two studies to show a positive result may have been due to limited time-frame for the intervention and/or failure to adequately implement the counter-measures in the communities.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>There are a very limited number of research studies allowing conclusions to be drawn about the effectiveness of community-based injury prevention programmes to prevent burns and scalds in children. There is a pressing need to evaluate high-quality community-based intervention programmes based on efficacious counter-measures to reduce burns and scalds in children.</P>
<P>It is important that a framework for considering the problem of burns and scalds in children from a prevention perspective be articulated, and that an evidence-based suite of interventions be combined to create programme guidelines suitable for implementation in communities throughout the world. </P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-08-06 22:42:15 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2008-08-06 22:42:14 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Burns and scalds to children under the age of 14 years comprise a large proportion of emergency department presentations in several countries (<LINK REF="REF-Ansari_x002d_Lari-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ansari-Lari 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Calder-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Calder 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Chien-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chien 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Laloe-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Laloe 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Quayle-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Quayle 2000</LINK>). Children who are not fatally injured by their burns and scalds are often left disfigured or disabled for life and must endure lengthy, painful hospital stays and rehabilitation periods (<LINK REF="REF-Herndon-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Herndon 1986</LINK>).</P>
<P>Children under the age of five years have the highest risk of death from burn injury (<LINK REF="REF-Morrow-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morrow 1996</LINK>) and increased risk of burn-related hospitalisation (<LINK REF="REF-Chien-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chien 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Laloe-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Laloe 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zeitlin-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zeitlin 1993</LINK>). Epidemiological studies conducted in a number of countries show children in this age group to have the highest burn incidence rate (<LINK REF="REF-Bang-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bang 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fukunishi-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fukunishi 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lari-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lari 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mahaluxmivala-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mahaluxmivala 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wilkinson-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wilkinson 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zeitlin-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zeitlin 1993</LINK>), with an annual incidence rate of up to 220 hospitalisations per 100,000 (<LINK REF="REF-HIC-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">HIC 1999</LINK>). In the five years and under age group, scalds are typically responsible for 50% of thermal injuries presenting to the emergency departments, and are more likely to lead to hospitalisation than burns of any other type (<LINK REF="REF-Hockey-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hockey 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Laloe-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Laloe 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ray-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ray 1995</LINK>).</P>
<P>Aetiological studies show that burns and scalds in younger children typically occur in the home and are caused by commonly used items, such as saucepans, kettles, taps, stoves, hot beverages, irons and heaters (<LINK REF="REF-Banco-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Banco 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hockey-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hockey 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zeitlin-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zeitlin 1993</LINK>). Burn injuries that occur at home account for over 80% of all childhood burn injuries in developed countries (<LINK REF="REF-Zeitlin-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zeitlin 1993</LINK>) and over 90% of all childhood burn injuries in developing countries (<LINK REF="REF-Bang-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bang 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lari-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lari 2002</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2008-08-06 22:42:05 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>A number of successful interventions have been demonstrated to reduce the risk of thermal injury for children within their homes. These include the installation of smoke alarms (<LINK REF="REF-DiGuiseppi-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">DiGuiseppi 1998</LINK>), education of children and families (<LINK REF="STD-Harre-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Harre 2000</LINK>), flame-resistant sleep-wear (<LINK REF="REF-Schieber-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schieber 2000</LINK>) and regulation of hot water temperatures below 49°C (<LINK REF="STD-Fallat-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Fallat 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Feldman-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Feldman 1978</LINK>). These interventions are either single counter-measures administered in a research setting under highly regulated conditions, or legislative changes made at policy level with no documented account of associated translation and dissemination activities. Evaluations of the former are largely individual-level, randomised controlled trials that measure the efficacy of the intervention, rather than the effectiveness of its use in the community under normal conditions. Evaluations of the latter are usually simple time-series analyses of outcomes over the period of legislative change, and provide low-level evidence of causal association.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2008-08-06 22:41:57 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>It has been hypothesised that sustained reductions in injury rates measured at the population level require the implementation of injury prevention counter-measures in the context of multi-strategy, multi-focused community level programmes, which use a combination of social and physical environmental interventions in the context of community-directed activity (<LINK REF="REF-Moller-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moller 1991</LINK>). With the development of burden-of-injury-based policies, national public health agendas are identifying the prevention of burns and scalds in children as a priority area and community-based child injury prevention programmes are increasingly being expected to include strategies to address the problem of burns and scalds in children amongst their activities (<LINK REF="REF-DHAC-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">DHAC 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mathers-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mathers 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Qld-Health-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Qld Health 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>The community-based approach is characterised by a shared ownership of the injury problem and its solution between experts and community members, and joint responsibility for determining appropriate interventions (<LINK REF="REF-Moller-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moller 1991</LINK>). Appropriate evaluation of the effectiveness of these programmes requires community level analysis and, while several studies of this kind exist, we are not aware of any comprehensive reviews which systematically examine the results of these studies and synthesise findings into a summary statement of current knowledge in the area.</P>

<P>The investigation of methods used in the implementation of community trials is a new field of exploration in injury research and few instruments to assess methodological quality are available. Traditional quality scoring was not undertaken. However, a quality assessment process was performed independently by two authors. This process was based on four of the seven criteria used for the quality assessment for controlled before and after designs, as described in Data Collection Checklist, developed by the Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care Review Group (EPOC). The criteria chosen are those that are relevant to community trial designs and specifically gauge the appropriateness of: baseline measurements, characteristics of the control site, protection against contamination between sites, and reliability of outcome measures.</P>

<STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<P>A total of 39 studies were considered for the review, of which only four met the criteria for inclusion (<LINK REF="STD-Guyer-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Guyer 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MacKay-1982" TYPE="STUDY">MacKay 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Peleg-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Peleg 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ytterstad-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Ytterstad 1995</LINK>).</P>
<P>The remaining 35 studies were excluded for the following reasons: the definition of a community-based intervention was not satisfied (n = 9); no injury outcomes were assessed (n = 12); the study reported injury outcomes for all ages and it was not possible to separate outcomes for children alone (n = 2); and no appropriate community control was used for comparison (n = 10).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Guyer-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Guyer 1989</LINK> <BR/>This was a report of the evaluation of the Statewide Childhood Injury Prevention Program (SCIPP) implemented in nine cities in Massachusetts, USA from September 1980 to June 1982. The programme consisted of five separate injury projects that sought to reduce the incidence of burns, falls in the home, motor vehicle traffic injuries, poisonings and suffocations in children aged five years and under. School and community burn prevention education, based on 'Project Burn Prevention' was one of these five injury projects. The total population of the nine intervention cities was 138,810. Five communities, with a combined population of 146,866 served as a control. Demographic characteristics of the intervention and control communities were reported in an earlier publication (<LINK REF="REF-Gallagher-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gallagher 1984</LINK>) and were similar for age composition, density, family size, ethnicity, housing characteristics, family income, poverty levels and education. The study also reported that communities were matched on characteristics related to hospital usage patterns, local paediatricians, school districts and boards of health. The intervention itself was educationally focussed, delivering the 'Project Burn Prevention' curricula through a variety of media including schools, libraries, fire and police authorities and day care centres. Both control and intervention communities were exposed to safety messages delivered outside the programme both before and during the intervention period.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-MacKay-1982" TYPE="STUDY">MacKay 1982</LINK>
<BR/>The study evaluated Project Burn Prevention, a school and media education campaign. The project was implemented from October 1977 to May 1978 in two communities within the Boston Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area (SMSA) - Lynn (population 78,000), and Quincy (population 91,000). The intervention itself was delivered through three channels: the mass media (television, radio, newspapers), schools (in Lynn only) and community organisations (in Quincy only). The content of the educational advice covered first aid for burns and prevention of scalds, flame and smoke injuries, electrical burns and contact burns. The advice targeted both behavioural and environmental changes, including the use of safety products, such as smoke detectors and non-flammable clothing. There were two separate control comparisons used. The first was a comparison between two additional communities within the Boston SMSA, Salem and Saugus, which also received the mass media element of the intervention. The second was a comparison between two communities who received no intervention which were part of the Springfield SMSA: Holyoake and South Hadley. </P>

<LINK REF="STD-Peleg-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Peleg 2005</LINK> <BR/>This study compared rates of hospitalisation for burn related injuries in Israeli communities which had implemented a burn prevention programme with those with no programme. Questionnaires were mailed to 70 organisations including universities, government agencies and volunteer organisations to determine intervention and control communities as well as to elicit details of the types of interventions that had been implemented. A 70% response rate was achieved which provided details on 16 injury prevention programmes throughout Israel. These programmes were delivered by the Ministries of Education and Health, hospitals, municipalities, health funds and non-profit organisations. The various interventions consisted of on-on-one guidance sessions, group training sessions, distribution of reading materials and the distribution of safety accessories. The study authors report that some interventions were multi-faceted, however do not provide further information in this regard. Results (hospitalisation rates) are reported separately for infants and toddlers (four years and under) and school-aged children (5 to 14 years). There were 15 communities (total 1998 population 70,200) with interventions targeting parents of infants and toddlers which were compared with 76 non-intervention localities (1998 population 211,700). School-aged children were targeted in 14 Jewish communities compared with 11 non-intervention Jewish communities. The number of non-Jewish intervention and non-intervention communities with school-aged children prevention programmes was not reported.</P>

<BR/>Burns in small children less than five years of age were a priority area targeted for intervention by the Harstad Injury Prevention Study. Harstad, a Norwegian city with 22,000 inhabitants, initiated a broad focussed injury prevention study in 1987, modelled on the World Health Organization (WHO) Manifesto for Safe Communities which states that "All human beings have an equal right to health and safety" (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1999</LINK>). The Safe Communities concept, originating in Sweden, has been adopted in many countries around the world, as a model for harnessing community enthusiasm and effort to enhance safety and reduce injury. The intervention consisted of educational advice for both the prevention of burn and scald injuries and immediate first aid treatment. A range of methods were used to convey the messages, including one-on-one counselling sessions by public health nurses and at health fairs and shopping malls as well as through local media. Environmental interventions in the form of reduced hot tap water thermostat settings (to 55°C) and cooker safeguards were strongly promoted. Vendors of electrical cookers were targeted by educational interventions also. Two controls were used for comparison: six municipalities surrounding Harstad which were increasingly exposed to the same interventions; and a separate community, Trondheim, located 1000 km away from Harstad, with a population of 134,000 inhabitants. Although Trondheim was a much larger city than Harstad, the authors reported similar demographic characteristics regarding age structure of the population, income levels, employment base and other socioeconomic factors. The control communities had been exposed to national child safety programmes, but did not receive the local community-based intervention.<BR/> </P>

<P>Four of seven criteria outlined in the Data Collection Checklist described by the Cochrane EPOC Review Group were used to establish the methodological quality of included studies. These four criteria were:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>availability of baseline measurements</LI>
<LI>appropriate choice of control</LI>
<LI>protection against contamination between intervention and control site</LI>
<LI>reliability of outcome measures.</LI>

<P>All four of the included studies provided both baseline measurements and reliable, hospital recorded injury outcome measures. In the Ytterstad study, however, the outcome data were obtained from a routine surveillance database, the accuracy of which was not provided.</P>
<P>Two of the studies (<LINK REF="STD-Guyer-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Guyer 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MacKay-1982" TYPE="STUDY">MacKay 1982</LINK>) chose appropriate control communities for comparison, however the control communities for the third and fourth studies were selected because of the availability of comparable outcome data (<LINK REF="STD-Ytterstad-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Ytterstad 1995</LINK>) or by default of having not implemented a burn injury prevention program in the study time-frame (<LINK REF="STD-Peleg-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Peleg 2005</LINK>). In the Norwegian study, the control community was six times the size of the intervention community. Despite this, population distribution and socioeconomic characteristics for the two communities were reportedly similar (<LINK REF="STD-Ytterstad-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Ytterstad 1995</LINK>). In the Israeli study (<LINK REF="STD-Peleg-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Peleg 2005</LINK>), the proportion of non-Jewish communities was higher in the localities with no intervention aimed at toddlers and infants (41 / 76) than in the intervention communities (2 / 15). This implies a socioeconomic differential between intervention and control sites which the authors attempted to rectify by reporting results separately for low and high socioeconomic communities.</P>
<P>Both <LINK REF="STD-Ytterstad-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Ytterstad 1995</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-MacKay-1982" TYPE="STUDY">MacKay 1982</LINK> ensured adequate protection against contamination between the control and intervention sites. In the <LINK REF="STD-Guyer-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Guyer 1989</LINK> study, however, various injury prevention initiatives that were concurrently conducted outside the programme may have led to misclassification of exposure to safety messages. The study authors report that it was not possible to either eliminate or estimate the magnitude of this confounding effect. They report that pre-intervention telephone surveys revealed that both control and intervention communities had been exposed to childhood safety messages prior to the intervention. Similar telephone surveys conducted post-intervention revealed that the intervention communities had a three-fold higher level of exposure to safety messages, but the control communities had also had an increase in exposure of about two-fold. <LINK REF="STD-Peleg-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Peleg 2005</LINK> reported that five of the 16 interventions identified by their project were state (nation) wide, however they continue to analyse and report results according to communities that did and did not receive an intervention. No explanation is provided as to how communities were allocated to intervention or control status when it may be presumed the whole country received some level of intervention.</P>

<P>Two of the four included studies reported a decrease in childhood injury rates due to burns and scalds as a result of the intervention (<LINK REF="STD-Peleg-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Peleg 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ytterstad-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Ytterstad 1995</LINK>).

<LINK REF="STD-Guyer-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Guyer 1989</LINK>
<BR/>In the Massachusetts Statewide Childhood Injury Prevention Program, the burn prevention component was estimated via telephone surveys to have reached only 10% of the target community. Burn-related injury incidence in children five years and under increased in both the intervention and control communities during the intervention period, compared with baseline. This increase was greater in the control communities: the incidence rose from 52.56 per 10,000 person years to 59.68 in the intervention community, and from 75.01 to 106.03 in the control communities. Higher baseline incidence in the control communities was reflective of lower socioeconomic characteristics in these areas. The calculated SES adjusted odds ratio for a burn injury post versus pre-intervention in the intervention communities compared to the control communities was 1.26 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.84 to 1.90).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-MacKay-1982" TYPE="STUDY">MacKay 1982</LINK>
<BR/>The Project Burn Prevention curricula implemented in Boston did not reduce the rate of burn injuries. However, this may have been reflective of the fact that the intervention lasted only eight months. Results indicated that the community-initiated intervention implemented in Quincy may have brought about a moderate and temporary reduction in burn injuries during the programme compared with before the programme (relative risk [RR] 0.8; 90% CI 0.7 to 1.0). This effect reduced in the 12 months post-intervention (RR 0.9; 90% CI 0.8 to 1.1). There was no effect of intervention for burns following the intervention programme for the school-initiated programme in Lynn (RR 1.1; 90% CI 1.0 to 1.2) or the control communities: Salem and Saugus with media campaign (RR 1.0; 90% CI 0.9 to 1.3); Holyoake and South Hadley (RR 1.0; 90% CI 0.8 to 1.1).</P>

<BR/>The infant and toddler hospitalisation rate for burn related injuries decreased significantly by 25% in intervention communities from 1.39 / 1000 to 1.05 / 1000 population while the hospitalisation rate remained unchanged at 1.26 / 1000 (P = 0.03) in non-intervention communities. The reduction was greater in high socioeconomic status (SES) intervention communities (29%) compared to low SES intervention communities (20%). There were no significant changes in burn related hospital admissions among school-aged children in either intervention (31% reduction ns) or non-intervention (21% reduction n.s.) communities.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Ytterstad-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Ytterstad 1995</LINK>
<BR/>Results from the Harstad Injury Prevention Study were published in both 1995 and 1998, at seven years and ten years post-initiation of the intervention. In 1995, a decrease of 52.9% for burn injury rates was reported in the intervention community (from 52.4 to 24.7 per 10,000 person years). This was compared to a decrease of 14.1% in the six surrounding municipalities, and an increase of 9.9% in Trondheim, the control community located 1000 km away. The calculated relative risk of burn injury in the intervention community was 0.47 (P = 0.045). The incidence changes were not significant in either of the two control groups.</P>
<P>In 1998, the burn and scalds incidence had decreased further to 57.5% in the intervention community compared to baseline (RR 0.49, P = 0.04). The incidence rate had also decreased further in the surrounding six municipalities by 40.1% (ns) and had increased again in Trondheim by 18.1% (ns) compared with baseline. The severity of thermal injuries also showed a downward shift with no injuries caused by tap water scalding or receptacles pulled from stoves in the final four years of data collection.</P>
</INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>Despite an extensive search of the literature, only four studies were identified that fulfilled the selection criteria. Two of the studies used sound methodology with contemporary comparison communities, strong measures of injury outcome and appropriate statistical analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Guyer-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Guyer 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MacKay-1982" TYPE="STUDY">MacKay 1982</LINK>) and neither of these studies showed the community-based intervention to be effective in reducing burn and scald injuries in children. The results of the two studies which did report a reduction in burn injuries for young children need to be considered in the context of specific methods used (<LINK REF="STD-Peleg-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Peleg 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ytterstad-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Ytterstad 1995</LINK>). </P>
<P>There are a number of issues that may weaken the conclusions of both the Peleg and Ytterstad studies. <LINK REF="STD-Peleg-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Peleg 2005</LINK> retrospectively assigned communities to intervention and control status depending on whether or not they had been exposed to an injury prevention campaign with a burn prevention component during the study timeframe. This introduced an element of self-selection by individual communities into their intervention status which may have produced a systematic bias into the subsequent results. There was no attempt to match intervention and control community characteristics, and the authors report a much higher proportion of poorer, non-Jewish communities in the non-intervention group. It was also reported that the interventions differed between the various communities, however there was limited information available about what each one entailed.</P>
<P>In the Harstad study, the reported incidence of burn injury fluctuated considerably over the ten-year follow-up period (<LINK REF="STD-Ytterstad-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Ytterstad 1995</LINK>). The linear regression analysis used to demonstrate statistically significant change over time did not model the social level confounders and did not take into account changing demographic characteristics of the denominator population. Furthermore the analysis would have been sensitive to the arbitrary time points chosen as boundaries of the period under review. One additional aspect that was not taken into consideration was that given the community level unit of intervention, adjustment for cluster effects in the variance estimates should have been included.</P>
<P>Ten community-based intervention studies were excluded from the review, because they did not have a control community as part of their evaluation study design (<LINK REF="STD-Argenio-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Argenio 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cagle-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Cagle 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Clark-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Clark 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Elberg-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Elberg 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Erdmann-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Erdmann 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fallat-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Fallat 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-NSW-Health-1998" TYPE="STUDY">NSW Health 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shani-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Shani 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sheller-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Sheller 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sheller-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Sheller 1998</LINK>). They all showed a positive effect on reducing burn injury outcomes for children, however, the lack of control community use in these studies means that it is not possible to attribute the reduction in injury rates solely to the intervention because other possible confounding factors were not taken into consideration.</P>
<P>A further twelve community-based studies were excluded because they did not assess injury outcomes as part of their evaluation (<LINK REF="STD-Ballesteros-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ballesteros 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Corrarino-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Corrarino 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gorman-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Gorman 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hammond-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Hammond 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Harre-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Harre 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hwang-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Hwang 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Katcher-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Katcher 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Macarthur-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Macarthur 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Maguina-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Maguina 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schmeer-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Schmeer 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Victor-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Victor 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Waller-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Waller 1993</LINK>).</P>
<P>The strengths of this review are that it examines for the first time the evidence-base justifying what has become a widely adopted approach to burns injury prevention in children, that is, community-based interventions, and enables this evidence to be judged on its merits. While much research has been conducted identifying efficacious counter-measures to reduce burn and scald injury (<LINK REF="REF-DiGuiseppi-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">DiGuiseppi 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-DiGuiseppi-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">DiGuiseppi 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fallat-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Fallat 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Feldman-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Feldman 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Harre-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Harre 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schieber-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schieber 2000</LINK>), there appears to be insufficient evidence relating to the combination of these interventions in the context of a community-based approach. There remains a gap between 'what we know works' in childhood burns and scalds injury prevention and 'how to make it work' in a real world setting. There is a paucity of research evidence from which to develop a set a evidence-based guidelines for practitioners implementing community-based programmes of activity in this area.</P>
<P>It is unlikely that positive publication bias has influenced the results of this review, as both positive and negative findings that met the inclusion criteria were located. The review does raise the question as to why there are only four evaluations of community-based injury programmes to prevent burns and scalds in children that have assessed injury outcomes and included a contemporary control community as a comparison in their study design.</P>
<P>Based on the studies excluded in this review it would appear that historically community-based programmes in this area have been of poor evaluation methodology or have not evaluated burn injury outcomes at all. The lack of attention given to evaluation methodology may be due to the paucity of funds made available for the evaluation component of community-based programmes and/or the prevailing attitudes that process evaluation only is necessary if counter-measures, which have been shown to be efficacious under research conditions, are used in the programme; and that evaluation of programmes against injury outcomes are not always possible due to long lead-times and relatively rare injury outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-Gallagher-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gallagher 2000</LINK>). It is probably timely, given recent advances in the field of health promotion, to consider the validity of this conventional attitude.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>There is a paucity of research studies in the literature from which practitioners can draw an evidence-base regarding the effectiveness of community-based injury prevention programmes to prevent burns and scalds in children. There is a need for practitioners to implement high-quality community-based intervention programmes, based on what research has shown to be efficacious counter-measures to reduce burns and scalds in children in research settings.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>There is a clear need to direct future research on developing the evidence from a variety of community contexts to achieve population level improvements in burns/scalds injury outcomes. Comprehensive and methodologically rigorous evaluations that include quality measure of injury outcomes and a contemporary community control as part of the study design should be expected of any new programmes undertaken. It is important that a framework for considering the problem of burns and scalds in children be articulated from a prevention perspective. Also, an evidence-based suite of interventions should be combined to create programme guidelines suitable for implementation (with local adaptations) in communities throughout the world. </P>
