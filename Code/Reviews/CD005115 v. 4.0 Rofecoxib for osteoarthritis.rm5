<TITLE>Rofecoxib for osteoarthritis</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>
<B>Editor's note: The anti-inflammatory drug rofecoxib (Vioxx) was withdrawn from the market at the end of September 2004 after it was shown that long-term use (greater than 18 months) could increase the risk of heart attack and stroke. Further information is available at www.vioxx.com.</B>
</P>
<P>
<B>Does Rofecoxib work for treating osteoarthritis and how safe is it?</B>
<BR/>To answer this question, scientists found and analyzed 26 studies. These studies included over 20 000 people with osteoarthritis and lasted up to 1 year. Studies compared people taking rofecoxib at 12.5, 25 or 50 mg once a day to people taking a placebo (sugar pill) or other NSAIDs such as diclofenac, ibuprofen, naproxen, nimesulide, nabumetone, paracetamol (Tylenol), celecoxib or Arthrotec. These studies provide the best evidence we have today. </P>
<P>
<B>What is osteoarthritis and how could rofecoxib help?</B>
<BR/>Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common form of arthritis that can affect the hands, hips, shoulders and knees. In OA, the cartilage that protects the ends of the bones breaks down and causes pain and swelling. Rofecoxib is often referred to as a 'COX II inhibitor' and is one of the new non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) prescribed to decrease pain and inflammation. Other NSAIDS, such as naproxen (Naprosyn) are also prescribed but they come with warnings that they may cause stomach problems such as ulcers, bleeds and sores that can be serious. Rofecoxib is thought to be safer on the stomach than other NSAIDS. </P>
<P>Rofecoxib was taken off the market in October 2004. A study had shown that people taking rofecoxib to prevent colon cancer had more heart attacks and strokes than people taking a sugar pill.</P>
<P>
<B>What did studies testing rofecoxib in OA show?</B>
<BR/>Studies showed people taking rofecoxib improved more than people taking a sugar pill. </P>
<P>Three studies showed that <BR/>&#8226; 29 out of 100 people felt better overall with a sugar pill<BR/>&#8226; 53 out of 100 people felt better overall with rofecoxib at 12.5 mg per day.</P>
<P>Studies also showed that improvements were about the same whether people took rofecoxib or a different NSAID. </P>
<P>
<B>How safe was it in the studies?</B>
<BR/>Very few studies recorded and reported stomach problems. When rofecoxib was compared to a sugar pill, more people taking rofecoxib had kidney problems, water retention and high blood pressure but the number of people with stomach problems was about the same.</P>
<P>When compared to other NSAIDs, less people taking 25 or 50 mg rofecoxib had stomach problems than when taking ibuprofen (800 mg three times a day) or naproxen. Rofecoxib also caused less diarrhea than arthrotec.</P>
<P>
<B>What is the bottom line?</B>
<BR/>Rofecoxib was withdrawn from the world wide market in October 2004 and is no longer available. </P>
<P>When considering which non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) to use, it must be remembered that the effects and safety of a drug is different among people and depends on the drug. The effect and safety also depends on the dose and how it acts in the body.</P>
<P>There are still questions about the effects and safety of other Cox-II inhibitors and more research is being done.</P>

<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>
<B>Editor's note: The anti-inflammatory drug rofecoxib (Vioxx) was withdrawn from the market at the end of September 2004 after it was shown that long-term use (greater than 18 months) could increase the risk of heart attack and stroke. Further information is available at www.vioxx.com.</B>

<P>Osteoarthritis is a chronic disease of the joints, characterised by joint pain, stiffness and loss of physical function. Its onset is age-related and occurs usually between the ages of 50 and 60. It is the commonest cause of disability in those aged over 65, with OA of the knee and/or hip affecting over 20 per cent of the elderly population.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To establish the efficacy and safety of rofecoxib in the management of OA by systematic review of available evidence.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>We searched the following databases up to August 2004: MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, National Research Register, NHS Economic Evaluation Database, Health Technology Assessment Database. The bibliographies of retrieved papers and content experts were consulted for additional references.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>All eligible randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were included. No unpublished RCTs were included in this edition of the review.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Data were abstracted independently by two reviewers. A validated checklist was used to score the quality of the RCTs. Comparable trials were pooled using fixed effects model.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Twenty-six RCTs were included. The comparators were placebo, diclofenac, ibuprofen, naproxen, nimesulide, nabumetone, paracetamol, celecoxib and Arthrotec. The evidence reviewed indicated that rofecoxib was more effective than placebo (patient global response RR 1.75 95% CI: 1.35, 2.26) but was associated with more adverse events (RR 1.32 95% CI 1.11, 1.56). There were no consistent differences in efficacy between rofecoxib and any of the active comparators at equivalent doses. Endoscopic studies indicated that compared to ibuprofen 800mg three times a day, rofecoxib caused fewer erosions and gastric ulcers at doses of 25mg and 50mg; the difference in duodenal ulcers was evident only at a dose of 25mg. Rofecoxib 50mg also caused more endoscopically observed ulcers greater than rofecoxib 25mg (RR 2.48 CI: 1.21, 5.11). Very few of the trials reported overall rates of GI adverse events although rofecoxib was found to cause fewer GI events than naproxen. Only one of the nine trials comparing rofecoxib to celecoxib reported on the overall rates of GI events and this was a comparison of the higher recommended dose of rofecoxib with the lower recommended dose of celecoxib. Similarly, the three trials in older hypertensive patients that examined the cardiovascular safety of rofecoxib and celecoxib used non-comparable doses; the results of these studies indicated that rofecoxib caused more patients to have oedema and a clinically significant increase in systolic blood pressure. This difference between rofecoxib and celecoxib was not evident in studies conducted in more general populations.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>Rofecoxib was voluntarily withdrawn from global markets in October 2004 therefore there are no implications for practice concerning its use. There remains a number of questions over both the benefits and risks associated with Cox II selective agents and further work is ongoing.</P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>

<BODY MODIFIED="2008-05-19 18:34:26 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common form of arthritis and is caused by degeneration of the joint cartilage and growth of new bone, cartilage and connective tissue. OA is a chronic disease and causes pain, stiffness and loss of physical function. It is often associated with significant disability and impaired quality of life, particularly when the knee and hip joints are affected. The onset of OA is age-related and occurs usually between the ages of 50 and 60.</P>
<P>OA is not curable therefore management relies on pain control, strategies to reduce stiffness and maintain physical function, and drugs to modify the disease process. Non-drug management (physiotherapy, occupational therapy, weight loss and exercise) can control some symptoms but invariably drugs are required. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are commonly used to reduce pain and inflammation. These are a diverse group of compounds that share many pharmacological properties and side-effects, including a propensity to cause damage to the gastro-intestinal tract. These gastro-intestinal (GI) effects commonly present as symptoms such as nausea, dyspepsia and gastritis. NSAIDs can however cause more serious GI complications (ulcers, perforations, obstructions and bleeding). Studies have indicated that ulcers that are visible on endoscopy are present in up to 40% of chronic NSAID users (<LINK REF="REF-Stalnikowicz-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stalnikowicz 1993</LINK>) but 85% of them never become clinically apparent. Perforations, obstructions and bleeds can be fatal but are less common with an estimated incidence of approximately 1.5% per year (<LINK REF="REF-Silverstein-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Silverstein 1995</LINK>). NSAIDs are weak acids and rapidly penetrate the superficial gastric mucosal lining cells, which can lead to erosion of the cells and cause symptoms. Whilst these local effects are important, they do not automatically result in ulcers; research indicates this is in part due to systemic inhibition of prostaglandins.</P>
<P>NSAIDs primarily act on the cyclo-oxygenase (Cox) enzyme that converts arachidonic acid into prostaglandins. Prostaglandins are a group of hormone-like chemicals that are normally present in the body and, amongst other functions, mediate inflammation and pain. Two principal forms of the Cox enzyme have been described; Cox I and Cox II (<LINK REF="REF-Vane-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vane 1998</LINK>). Cox I is responsible for the production of prostaglandins that are essential for maintenance of normal endocrine and kidney function, gastric mucosal integrity and the processes that stop bleeding (haemostasis). Cox I is normally present in high concentrations in platelets, vascular endothelial cells, the stomach and kidney collecting tubules. Platelet Cox-1 mediates the production of thromboxane A2, a prostaglandin that promotes constriction of the blood vessels and activates the platelets causing them to aggregate.</P>
<P>In contrast, Cox II is normally virtually undetectable in most tissues but it is produced in response to inflammatory and mitogenic stimuli; this suggests that it has an important role in the mediation of inflammation (<LINK REF="REF-Vane-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vane 1998</LINK>). It has been shown that Cox II is induced in rheumatoid synoviocytes, macrophages and polymorphonuclear leukocytes (<LINK REF="REF-Vane-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vane 1998</LINK>). Cox II also is involved in production of prostacylin, a prostaglandin that dilates blood vessels, and inhibits aggregation of the platelets.</P>
<P>Research indicated that the GI adverse events associated with NSAIDs are due, at least in part, to inhibition of Cox I. It was therefore hypothesised that if an NSAID inhibited Cox II alone, whilst having a minimal effect on Cox I, the gastrointestinal adverse effects could be reduced with no impact on effectiveness. This led to the development of the group of NSAIDs known as the coxibs, which currently includes celecoxib, etoricoxib, lumiracoxib, parecoxib, rofecoxib, and valdecoxib. This review examines the safety and efficacy of rofecoxib, which is licensed for OA at a dose of 12.5mg to 25mg/day.</P>

<P>The titles and abstracts identified by the searches were assessed by two reviewers (RF, SG) for inclusion.</P>
</SEARCH_METHODS>
<DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION<BR/>Two reviewers (SG and DF or RF) independently ascertained whether each study met the inclusion criteria for the review and a double abstraction process was undertaken. Any discrepancies were resolved by discussion and where this was not possible the authors of the study were contacted for clarification. Abstracts were considered in tandem with the full publication.</P>
<P>QUALITY ASSESSMENT<BR/>The methodological quality of the included studies was assessed by two independent reviewers (SG,LM) on the basis of randomisation, adequate concealment of randomisation, degree of blinding, use of intention to treat analysis and description of dropouts and withdrawals. The Jadad and Schultz assessment tools (<LINK REF="REF-Jadad-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jadad 1996</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>) were used to assign the quality scores to each study. </P>
<P>DATA ANALYSIS<BR/>Where possible data from intention to treat (ITT) analysis were abstracted. Results are presented in both absolute and relative terms and are presented as relative risks (RR) or mean differences (MD) with their 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). A fixed effects model was used throughout. Data on the incidence of ulcers detected on endoscopy were considered separately from those that presented clinically.</P>

<STUDY_QUALITY>
<P>The methodological quality of the included studies was assessed using a validated checklist (<LINK REF="REF-Jadad-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jadad 1996</LINK>) that rates the appropriateness of randomisation (2 points), appropriateness of double blinding (2 points) and description of dropouts and withdrawals (1 point), the total possible score is five. In addition, concealment allocation was assessed and rated as A (blind randomisation), B (unclear methods of randomisation), or C (quasi-randomisation) (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>). Quality was assessed independently by two reviewers (SG, LM). Differences were resolved by consensus. </P>
<P>Quality was not assessed on those trials published in abstract form only. All but one trial were randomised, double blinded trials; <LINK REF="STD-Niccoli-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Niccoli 2002</LINK> was single-blinded. All trials except for <LINK REF="STD-Hawkey-2000_x0028_MSD-045_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Hawkey 2000(MSD 045)</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Laine-1999-_x0028_MSD-044_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Laine 1999 (MSD 044)</LINK> included a description of the reasons for dropouts. The <LINK REF="STD-Herrera-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Herrera 2003</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Ehrich-2001_x0028_MSD-029_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Ehrich 2001(MSD 029)</LINK> papers received a quality score of three because neither the method of randomisation nor the method of double-blinding was described. <LINK REF="STD-Niccoli-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Niccoli 2002</LINK> received a quality score of three because it was singled blinded and the method of randomization was not described. <LINK REF="STD-Hawkey-2000_x0028_MSD-045_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Hawkey 2000(MSD 045)</LINK> did not give the reason for withdrawal, nor the method of randomization and so also scored a three. <LINK REF="STD-McKenna-2000" TYPE="STUDY">McKenna 2000</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Bianchi-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Bianchi 2003</LINK> both had a quality score of four because they did not describe the method of blinding. <LINK REF="STD-Laine-1999-_x0028_MSD-044_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Laine 1999 (MSD 044)</LINK> also scored a four because the reason for dropout was not described. The remaining papers all included a description of appropriate randomisation and double blinding so received two additional points and an overall quality score of five out of five. Clear methods of concealment of allocation was stated in five trials (<LINK REF="STD-Day-2000-_x0028_MSD-040_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Day 2000 (MSD 040)</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Ehrich-1999-_x0028_pilot_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Ehrich 1999 (pilot)</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kivitz-2004_x0028_MSD-085_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Kivitz 2004(MSD 085)</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Laine-1999-_x0028_MSD-044_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Laine 1999 (MSD 044)</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-SUCCESS-VI" TYPE="STUDY">SUCCESS VI</LINK>) and therefore received a concealment rating of A.

<B>1. ROFECOXIB versus PLACEBO</B>
<BR/>13 RCTs were identified that had a rofecoxib arm and a placebo arm; two included only a rofecoxib and a placebo arm <LINK REF="STD-Ehrich-2001_x0028_MSD-029_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Ehrich 2001(MSD 029)</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ehrich-1999-_x0028_pilot_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Ehrich 1999 (pilot)</LINK>, whilst the other 11 had additional active comparators.

<P>
<B>1.1 EFFICACY</B>
<BR/>Meta-analysis was possible for a number of efficacy outcomes; rofecoxib was consistently found to be superior to placebo across the WOMAC subscales although some heterogeneity was seen in the results due to the findings of <LINK REF="STD-Gibofsky-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Gibofsky 2003</LINK>. Similarly, all patient/investigator ratings, measured on both continuous and dichotomous scales in both individual trials and the pooled results, indicated rofecoxib to be superior apart from one trial's investigator improved/ not improved 25mg 6 weeks <LINK REF="STD-Gibofsky-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Gibofsky 2003</LINK> and another's patient measures of disease status <LINK REF="STD-Truitt-2001_x0028_MSD-058_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Truitt 2001(MSD 058)</LINK>. The number needed to treat (NNT) with rofecoxib versus placebo to achieve an improvement in patient global assessment was 5 (95% CI: 4, 6)(see Additional tables, <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>; <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>) Two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Truitt-2001_x0028_MSD-058_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Truitt 2001(MSD 058)</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Day-2000-_x0028_MSD-040_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Day 2000 (MSD 040)</LINK>) reported on joint tenderness at 6 weeks, which was less in both the 12.5mg and 25mg groups. One study reported SF36 physical component and mental components at 6 weeks; all rofecoxib doses were superior to placebo <LINK REF="STD-Ehrich-2001_x0028_MSD-029_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Ehrich 2001(MSD 029)</LINK>. Four trials reported on paracetamol rescue, which was less in the rofecoxib group apart from in <LINK REF="STD-Gibofsky-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Gibofsky 2003</LINK>. Rofecoxib also caused statistically significantly fewer withdrawals due to lack of efficacy across all doses and timepoints.</P>
<P>
<B>1.2 SAFETY </B>
<BR/>Meta-analysis was possible for a number of safety outcomes. Many of the trials did not report total numbers of adverse events. Rofecoxib was found to have a statistically significant greater overall rate of adverse events at the following dose/duration: 12.5mg 6 weeks; 25mg 6 weeks and 50mg 18 weeks. The number of serious adverse events was greater at a dose of 12.5mg at 6 weeks (RR: 3.95 CI: 1.05, 14.63). The event rates were too low in the 25mg trials to allow meaningful comparison. The rates of total GI events were statistically significant over 6 weeks with the 25mg dose (RR: 3.39 CI: 1.47; 7.84). One study showed a statistically significant increase in systolic BP using 25mg at 6 weeks (RR: 2.89 CI: 1.17, 7.84) and rofecoxib 12.5mg caused a greater incidence of lower extremity oedema at 6 weeks (RR: 2.40 CI: 1.05, 5.48). No other differences were observed. Withdrawals due to adverse events were significantly greater in the rofecoxib 12.5mg group over 6/8 weeks (RR: 2.18 CI: 1.34, 3.55) and 50mg at 12 weeks (RR: 2.04 CI: 1.24, 3.36) but not 25mg at 6 weeks (RR: 1.56 CI: 0.94, 2.59). Two trials reported withdrawals due to GI adverse and CV adverse events and found no statistically significant differences <LINK REF="STD-McKenna-2000" TYPE="STUDY">McKenna 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Saag-1998-_x0028_MSD-033_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Saag 1998 (MSD 033)</LINK>. The one trial that reported withdrawals due to CV adverse events found no difference <LINK REF="STD-Saag-1998-_x0028_MSD-033_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Saag 1998 (MSD 033)</LINK>. Pooled analysis of the two 18 week endoscopy studies indicated that there were no statistically significant differences in the rates of ulcers or erosions apart from rofecoxib causing fewer ulcers greater than or equal to 5mm in diameter (RR: 0.42 CI: 0.20, 0.86).</P>
<P>
<B>2. ROFECOXIB versus DICLOFENAC</B>
<BR/>Three published RCTs were identified that compared rofecoxib (12.5mg or 25mg per day) to diclofenac 50mg three times a day. Other than the rates of withdrawals there were no poolable data therefore the results of individual studies are presented below.</P>
<P>The first RCT was an Italian two-week, single-blind study that compared the renal tolerability of rofecoxib 25mg per day with that of diclofenac 150 mg per day and amtolmetin guacyl (AMG) in 90 individuals between 60 and 80 years of age <LINK REF="STD-Niccoli-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Niccoli 2002</LINK>. The publication was however ambiguous about the methodology used in this study and states that dropouts were replaced by the next eligible patient, who was assigned to the same treatment arm. Six patients were "discounted" (1 AMG; 1 diclofenac; 4 rofecoxib) because they withdrew from the study during the first week of treatment due to intolerance or adverse events. Patients were also withdrawn if any adverse event related to the study drug occurred. The paper does however state that all adverse events statistics (excluding those for renal function) were based on the 96 patients originally enrolled.</P>
<P>The other two RCTs enrolled 693 <LINK REF="STD-Saag-2000-_x0028_MSD-034_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Saag 2000 (MSD 034)</LINK> and 784 patients <LINK REF="STD-Cannon-2000_x0028_MSD-035_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Cannon 2000(MSD 035)</LINK> over 40 years of age with OA of the knee or hip. Over a one-year period rofecoxib 12.5mg and 25mg per day was compared under double-blind conditions to 50mg diclofenac three times per day. Neither of the primary publications states that the trials were of identical design, but data from the two 'replicate' trials have been pooled in a post-hoc analysis of data collected from liver-function tests <LINK REF="REF-Cannon--2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cannon 2003</LINK> and two-year follow up data have also been published in abstract form <LINK REF="REF-Cannon-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cannon 2003</LINK>.</P>
<P>There are however a number of ambiguities in the report of MSD 034 which makes it difficult to validate the results (see notes Table of Included Studies). Although it is described as a one-year study, the publication states that "primary efficacy analyses were based on the average change from baseline over the first 12-week treatment period. Analyses were also performed at 26 and 52 weeks". No 12-week data are reported and no measures of dispersion given for the 52 week data. After 26 weeks of treatment topical or systemic analgesics and corticosteroids were permitted for breakthrough OA pain. Figure 4 in the publication indicates "p&lt;0.001 vs. placebo for all active treatments" despite no placebo group being reported in the methods section. There are also some conflicts in the text with regard to the designation of the primary endpoints with Figure 4 and the results section indicating that they were the WOMAC subscales and the methods section which indicates only the WOMAC pain. The methods section states that for clinical comparability two conditions had to be met: in any two of the primary endpoints, the 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of mean differences between treatment groups were to be within predefined comparability bounds (+/- 10mm on a 100-mm VAS and +/- 0.5 on a Likert); and all 3 of the posterior probabilities (with noninformative prior distributions) that the true mean differences are within the predefined clinical comparability bounds were p&lt;.05.</P>
<P>
<B>2.1 EFFICACY</B>
<BR/>Other than for withdrawals due to lack of efficacy, no pooling of efficacy data was possible and therefore results for individual studies are presented below. Pooled data indicated that over one year fewer individuals taking rofecoxib 25mg per day withdrew due to lack of efficacy compared to those taking diclofenac 50mg three times a day (RR: 1.43 CI 1.05, 1.94). There were no statistically significant differences in the 12.5mg comparison (RR: 1.11 CI: 0.80, 1.54).</P>
<P>After two weeks, the Italian study stated that rofecoxib and diclofenac significantly improved the measures of pain, and according to the patients' and physicians' global assessment of disease activity, the reduction in the diclofenac group was significantly greater (p&lt;0.001) <LINK REF="STD-Niccoli-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Niccoli 2002</LINK>. Patient global assessment of pain (WMD -6.26 95% CI: -10.78, -1.74); patient global disease activity (WMD -6.39; 95% CI: -10.87, -1.91); physician disease activity (WMD -5.08; 95% CI: -9.66, -0.50). The results however may be compromised due to the unusual methodology.</P>
<P>In the first of the one year studies, all three groups experienced significant improvement in disease status from baseline, which met the author's pre-specified criteria for comparable efficacy; comparability stated if for all three primary endpoints, the 95% confidence intervals of the difference in the mean treatment response between two treatments were within + or - 10mm on a 100mm VAS scale or 0.5 on a Likert scale <LINK REF="STD-Cannon-2000_x0028_MSD-035_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Cannon 2000(MSD 035)</LINK>. There were statistically significant differences in favour of diclofenac for the patients' assessment of response to therapy and the physicians' assessment of disease status, although the paper states that this was only measured up to 26 weeks. The authors report that treatment by factor analysis for the 3 primary endpoints showed that there was no statistically significant interaction with treatment for various subgroups, including location of the study joint (knee or hip), previous OA medication (NSAID/paracetamol), age and gender.</P>
<P>In the second year-long RCT, only the mean changes were available without any measures of dispersion <LINK REF="STD-Saag-2000-_x0028_MSD-034_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Saag 2000 (MSD 034)</LINK>. In addition, no 12-week data were reported, despite this being stated as the primary endpoint. At 52 weeks there were no statistically significant differences between rofecoxib 12.5mg and rofecoxib 25mg, but the 12.5mg dose showed statistically significant less efficacy compared to diclofenac on pain on walking on a flat surface, investigator global assessment of response to therapy, patient global assessment of disease status and increased rescue paracetamol use. None of these endpoints were designated as primary. There is additionally ambiguity concerning the results of rofecoxib 25mg versus diclofenac with the table not indicating any statistically significant differences but the text stating " Efficacy results were consistent for each dose of rofecoxib compared with diclofenac for the endpoints: patient global assessment of response to therapy and investigator global assessment of disease status (p=0.03 vs. 25mg, and p=0.01 vs. 12.5mg respectively). For patient global assessment of disease status rofecoxib was different [less improvement] from diclofenac (p=0.01)." Although the methods section states the grounds for clinical comparability the results state that the 95% confidence intervals for the difference between 12.5mg and 25mg rofecoxib vs. diclofenac were contained within the prespecified comparability grounds for the WOMAC scales, indicating clinical comparability.</P>
<P>
<B>2.2 SAFETY</B>
<BR/>The two-week renal tolerability study stated that both diclofenac and rofecoxib impaired renal function (unlike AMG). The validity of the results may however be compromised by the unusual methodology <LINK REF="STD-Niccoli-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Niccoli 2002</LINK>. The authors concluded that rofecoxib caused increased water and salt retention as indicated by a significant increase in body weight, systolic and diastolic blood pressure and serum sodium and uric acid. A significant reduction in diuresis and creatinine clearance also occurred; 6 patients experienced oliguria and mild malleolar oedema and weight gain, 4 patients developed hypertension and an additional 4 patients withdrew from the study due to acute development of marked peripheral oedema and rapid weight gain. In the diclofenac group there was an increase in BUN and serum creatinine, potassium and uric acid, with a decrease in 24-hour urine volume and creatinine clearance. One patient withdrew due to gastric intolerance and a further 8 experienced gastric pain. AMG treated patients did not show any significant impairment of renal function. The only between group comparison reported was a significant reduction in creatinine clearance in the diclofenac group compared to both the AMG and the rofecoxib group.</P>
<P>The first one-year RCT, reported no differences in GI events, CV events, oedema or PUBs <LINK REF="STD-Cannon-2000_x0028_MSD-035_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Cannon 2000(MSD 035)</LINK>. The diclofenac group experienced greater increases in mean alanin and aspartate aminotransferase levels. No episodes of GI bleeding were reported.</P>
<P>The second one-year RCT only presented data for drug related adverse experiences occurring in &gt;= 5% of patients <LINK REF="STD-Saag-2000-_x0028_MSD-034_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Saag 2000 (MSD 034)</LINK>. The authors report that the rates of individual adverse experiences were generally similar between the groups for all events occurring at &gt;=5% of individuals except for abdominal pain which occurred at a significantly higher rate in the diclofenac group compared to both the rofecoxib groups 13/230 vs. 2/231 and 2/232(p=0.01). Four deaths were reported in the diclofenac group with none in the rofecoxib group; no death was considered to be drug related by the investigator with all having previous medical history of related disorders. More patients discontinued due to adverse experiences and due to GI adverse experiences in the diclofenac group. No rates of overall GI adverse events are reported as the publication only reports those occurring with an incidence of &gt;= 5%. Discontinuations due to cardiovascular events, including hypertension, palpitation, and Transient Ischaemic Attack (TIA) occurred in 3/231, 4/232 and 3/230 (RR: 1.00; 95% CI: 0.2, 4.9) and (RR: 1.3; 95% CI: 0.3; 5.8) respectively. Diclofenac again was shown to raise transaminase levels 10/230 compared to 1/232 receiving 25 mg rofecoxib.</P>
<P>The ambiguities in the reports not withstanding, the withdrawal data from the two trials one-year could be pooled: There were fewer withdrawals due to AE in both the 12.5mg rofecoxib (RR: 0.71 CI: 0.52, 0.97) and 25mg (RR: 0.70 CI: 0.51, 0.95) groups respectively. There were no statistically significant differences in the withdrawals due to GI adverse events, total withdrawals and CV adverse events.</P>
<P>The post-hoc analysis of liver-function tests indicates that there were statistically significantly less disturbances of liver function in the rofecoxib groups compared to the diclofenac. The number of patients reported is not consistent with the primary papers however and only percentage results are reported with no indication of the numbers in each group <LINK REF="REF-Cannon--2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cannon 2003</LINK>.</P>

<BR/>Four double-blind RCTs were identified that compared rofecoxib to ibuprofen in patients with OA; <LINK REF="STD-Saag-1998-_x0028_MSD-033_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Saag 1998 (MSD 033)</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Day-2000-_x0028_MSD-040_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Day 2000 (MSD 040)</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Laine-1999-_x0028_MSD-044_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Laine 1999 (MSD 044)</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hawkey-2000_x0028_MSD-045_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Hawkey 2000(MSD 045)</LINK>. Two of these RCTs were of identical design and used endoscopy to compare the gastro-duodenal impact of 16 to 24 weeks treatment with either 25mg or 50 mg rofecoxib once daily, ibuprofen 800mg three times a day or placebo in 775 <LINK REF="STD-Hawkey-2000_x0028_MSD-045_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Hawkey 2000(MSD 045)</LINK> and 742 <LINK REF="STD-Laine-1999-_x0028_MSD-044_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Laine 1999 (MSD 044)</LINK> patients. Neither trial enrolled aspirin users. At 16 weeks "because of an anticipated lack of efficacy in the placebo group, 95% of placebo patients and 5% of patients in the other groups (in a blinded fashion) were randomly discontinued, via a separate set of individually sealed envelopes". Investigations were performed at baseline, 6, 12 and 24 weeks. Only 12-week endoscopy data are included in this review due to the random discontinuations. The Hawkey paper also states that 89 patients did not undergo treatment-phase endoscopy. The discussion in the publication also states "the ulcer incidence rates for the rofecoxib groups did not change significantly in the second three months compared to the first three months. This suggests no change in the risk of GI injury with COX-2 specific inhibition with rofecoxib over 6 months. However without a placebo group for comparison in the second 3 months of the study, this inference cannot be confirmed". Neither publication makes it clear at what time point the trial profiles and the analysis of adverse events and withdrawals relate to. Therefore it is assumed to be 16 weeks. The incidence of events in many cases is given in percentages and, because the denominators are uncertain, the numerators may be incorrect.</P>
<P>The other two RCTs compared rofecoxib (12.5mg or 25mg once daily) to ibuprofen (800mg three times a day) or placebo over a six week period in 1156 <LINK REF="STD-Saag-1998-_x0028_MSD-033_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Saag 1998 (MSD 033)</LINK> and 809 adults with OA <LINK REF="STD-Day-2000-_x0028_MSD-040_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Day 2000 (MSD 040)</LINK>.</P>
<P>
<B>3.1 EFFICACY</B>
<BR/>The endoscopy study patients completed a 5-point Likert 'Patient Global Assessment of Disease Efficacy' at each visit. Both trials reported that the mean change from baseline was significantly greater in the active treatment groups compared to placebo (p&lt;0.001). Insufficient data were presented to permit statistical combination of the results and rofecoxib and ibuprofen were not statistically compared. There was no statistically significant difference in the pooled estimates of withdrawals due to lack of efficacy <LINK REF="STD-Hawkey-2000_x0028_MSD-045_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Hawkey 2000(MSD 045)</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Laine-1999-_x0028_MSD-044_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Laine 1999 (MSD 044)</LINK>.</P>
<P>Although the two 6-week trials were of similar design, lack of appropriate data in the publication prevented pooling of the trials for all outcomes apart from withdrawals due to lack of efficacy.<BR/>The Saag publication states that the treatments had comparable efficacy over the six-week period, but only presents mean values with no measures of dispersion <LINK REF="STD-Saag-1998-_x0028_MSD-033_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Saag 1998 (MSD 033)</LINK>. The number of patients reporting a good or excellent global assessment of response to therapy was 126/221 in the ibuprofen group compared to 120/219 in the 12.5mg rofecoxib group (RR: 0.96 95%CI: 0.81, 1.13) and 138/227 in the rofecoxib 25mg group (RR: 1.07 95% CI: 0.91, 1.25). The publication also reports that overall rates of withdrawals due to lack of efficacy (LOE) indicated comparable efficacy with 12.5mg rofecoxib, but that 25 mg was superior i.e. had fewer withdrawals (RR: 0.46 95% CI: 0.21, 1.00). However when the results were pooled with the second RCT <LINK REF="STD-Day-2000-_x0028_MSD-040_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Day 2000 (MSD 040)</LINK>, the results did not reach significance: 12.5mg (RR: 0.9; 95% CI: 0.54, 1.52) and 25mg (RR: 0.57; 95% CI: 0.31, 1.03).</P>
<P>The Day publication states that the clinical efficacy of both rofecoxib groups was comparable with that of ibuprofen, using pre-specified comparability criteria <LINK REF="STD-Day-2000-_x0028_MSD-040_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Day 2000 (MSD 040)</LINK>. The effect of 25mg rofecoxib was however statistically significant superior to that of ibuprofen in two of the primary measures; patient global response to therapy (RR: 0.22 CI: 0.06, 0.38) and investigator global disease status (RR: 0.19 CI: 0.06, 0.32). The secondary criterion of patient measured disease status also indicated statistical superiority of 25mg dose (RR: 3.77 CI: 0.09, 7.45). Joint tenderness results were also significantly in favour of rofecoxib 25mg but WOMAC scores did not indicate any significant difference.</P>
<P>
<B>3.2 SAFETY</B>
<BR/>Data at 12 weeks from the two identical endoscopy studies <LINK REF="STD-Hawkey-2000_x0028_MSD-045_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Hawkey 2000(MSD 045)</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Laine-1999-_x0028_MSD-044_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Laine 1999 (MSD 044)</LINK> were pooled; rofecoxib at doses of 25mg and 50mg was associated with fewer gastric ulcers than ibuprofen 800mg three times a day (RR: 0.15 CI: 0.09, 0.25) and (RR: 0.23 CI: 0.14, 0.36). However, although the results indicated that rofecoxib also caused fewer duodenal ulcers at a dose of 25mg (RR: 0.24 CI: 0.09, 0.63), at the 50mg dose, the reduction did not reach significance (RR: 0.55 CI: 0.27, 1.12). Information on the number of erosions on endoscopy was also reported in broad terms but data from the two RCTs could not be combined because Laine and the pooled analysis reported results in graphical form only <LINK REF="REF-Hawkey--2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hawkey 2001</LINK>. Results from the Hawkey trial indicated both doses of rofecoxib were associated with fewer erosions (25mg WMD -2.98 CI: -3.71, -2.25) and 50mg WMD -2.74 CI: -3.48, -2.00) <LINK REF="STD-Hawkey-2000_x0028_MSD-045_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Hawkey 2000(MSD 045)</LINK>.</P>
<P>With respect to the number of complicated upper GI events, there is some ambiguity about the number of bleeds experienced. The Laine publication states that three ulcer complications occurred (2 upper GI bleeding episodes in the ibuprofen group and 1 in the 25mg rofecoxib group) and the Hawkey publication that one patient receiving placebo developed an upper GI bleed and 1 receiving ibuprofen. However the publication of the combined analysis states that "sixteen of the clinical presentations with a bleed that were reported during the 12- week placebo controlled parts of the studies were confirmed by the adjudication committee" <LINK REF="STD-Hawkey-2000_x0028_MSD-045_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Hawkey 2000(MSD 045)</LINK> <LINK REF="REF-Hawkey--2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hawkey 2001</LINK>. No breakdown by allocated group was presented.<BR/>Data on the rates of withdrawals due to adverse events could be pooled and the only statistically significant difference was that there were fewer in the 25mg rofecoxib group in the endoscope studies at 16 weeks.</P>
<P>Pooling of data on adverse events was hampered due to poor reporting. The Saag publication only reports on adverse events that occurred with an incidence of &gt;=5%; lower extremity oedema and diarrhoea <LINK REF="STD-Saag-1998-_x0028_MSD-033_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Saag 1998 (MSD 033)</LINK>. No overall rates of adverse events or GI adverse events were presented. The Day publication also does not report the overall rates of GI events <LINK REF="STD-Day-2000-_x0028_MSD-040_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Day 2000 (MSD 040)</LINK>. Pooling of the available data indicated no significant differences at any dose or time-point. For the 25mg dose of rofecoxib there was some indication that there was more lower-extremity oedema (RR: 2.34 CI: 0.84, 6.52) in the Saag trial <LINK REF="STD-Saag-1998-_x0028_MSD-033_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Saag 1998 (MSD 033)</LINK>. The Day publication reports that the incidence of any laboratory adverse events, body weight change, blood pressure change, oedema and hypertension were not significantly different in the active groups, but no data are presented <LINK REF="STD-Day-2000-_x0028_MSD-040_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Day 2000 (MSD 040)</LINK>.</P>
<P>
<B>4. ROFECOXIB VERSUS NAPROXEN</B>
</P>
<P>Three RCTs were identified that enrolled a total of 6501 patients. Two of the RCTs had identical protocols and were therefore combined into a single publication <LINK REF="STD-NAPROXEN-901-OC_x002f_OF" TYPE="STUDY">NAPROXEN 901 OC/OF</LINK>. Rofecoxib 12.5mg once daily was compared to naproxen 500mg twice daily for six weeks in a total of 944 patients aged 40 years or over with OA of the knee or hip. Matching placebos were used to maintain blinding.</P>
<P>The 12-week double-blind ADVANTAGE study enrolled 5557 patients and compared rofecoxib 25mg daily with naproxen 500mg twice daily <LINK REF="STD-Advantage-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Advantage 2000</LINK>. Again, matching placebos were used to maintain blinding. Six-week data were not reported therefore no meta-analysis could be undertaken. Patients were permitted to take concomitant GI protective medication (PPI, antacids or H2blockers); which were taken in 253/2785 vs 310/2772 individuals (RR: 0.81 CI: 0.69, 0.95).</P>
<P>A fourth study, the Pharmacia sponsored CRESCENT study, examined 24 ambulatory blood pressure in patients with Type II diabetes who were taking ACE inhibitors for hypertension <LINK REF="STD-CRESCENT-_x0028_Sowers_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">CRESCENT (Sowers)</LINK>. Patients received 25mg rofecoxib (once daily), 200mg celecoxib (once daily) or naproxen 500mg (twice daily) over 12 weeks. Very limited data were available for evaluation as the methods and results have only been published in abstract form.</P>
<P>
<B>4.1 EFFICACY</B>
<BR/>No pooling of data could be undertaken and therefore the results of individual studies are discussed.</P>
<P>The publication for the 901 OC/OF studies presents results graphically with tabulated differences in mean changes with no measures of dispersion. The authors however report that one of the studies in the combined analysis found a statistically significant difference in favour of naproxen for the patient global assessment of response to therapy (one of the designated primary endpoints) <LINK REF="STD-NAPROXEN-901-OC_x002f_OF" TYPE="STUDY">NAPROXEN 901 OC/OF</LINK>. This finding was not duplicated in the second study. There were also some significant differences in favour of naproxen in some of the secondary endpoints and in the combined analysis. However the authors reported that all 95% CI's were well within the pre-stated equivalence boundaries indicating comparable treatment effects. The authors therefore concluded that 12.5mg of rofecoxib once daily was comparable to 500mg naproxen twice daily. However, additional 'rescue' medication was taken by 56% of rofecoxib patients and 53.5% of naproxen patients (RR 1.05 CI: 0.93, 1.18). There were no differences reported in the onset of pain relief (RR 1.11; 95% CI: 0.96, 1.28). Treatment by subgroup interaction tests indicated that the effect was consistent across subgroups.</P>
<P>The ADVANTAGE study permitted rescue medication but no results were reported <LINK REF="STD-Advantage-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Advantage 2000</LINK>. Onset of pain relief was reported to be similar in the two groups and after 12 weeks of therapy there were no statistically significant differences in any of the endpoints between 25mg rofecoxib and 500mg naproxen. Withdrawals due to lack of efficacy were similar 177/2785 vs. 176/2772 (RR: 1.00 CI: 0.82, 1.22).</P>
<P>The abstract for the <LINK REF="STD-CRESCENT-_x0028_Sowers_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">CRESCENT (Sowers)</LINK> study reported that the "arthritis assessments demonstrated that changes in total WOMAC were similar for all 3 treatments at week 6 (p=0.4) and week 12 (p=0.39)". No data were provided.</P>
<P>
<B>4.2 SAFETY</B>
<BR/>The Naproxen 901 studies indicated that although there was no statistically significant difference in the overall rates of adverse events, fewer patients in the rofecoxib group experienced GI adverse events 63/471 vs. 114/473 (RR: 0.55 CI: 0.42, 0.73) which led to fewer discontinuations (RR: 0.28 CI: 0.10, 0.75) <LINK REF="STD-NAPROXEN-901-OC_x002f_OF" TYPE="STUDY">NAPROXEN 901 OC/OF</LINK>. Seventeen patients in the study had a serious adverse event (RR: 0.70 CI: 0.27, 1.83), of which six were considered by the investigator to be possibly or probably drug related; 1 case of CHF in the rofecoxib group and 5 in the naproxen group (duodenal ulcer, drug overdose, CHF, gastric ulcer and bleeding gastric ulcer). There were no PUBs in the rofecoxib group and 3 in the naproxen (RR: 0.14 CI: 0.01, 2.77). There were similar rates of reno-vascular events, although numerically more patients discontinued due to hypertension (2/471 vs 0/473 RR: 5.02 CI: 0.24, 104.31) and peripheral/lower extremity oedema (3/471 vs 0/473 RR: 7.03 CI: 0.36, 135.72).</P>
<P>The ADVANTAGE study publication does not present any rates of adverse events other than CV <LINK REF="STD-Advantage-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Advantage 2000</LINK>. There were 5 patients in the rofecoxib group who experienced an MI compared to 1 in the naproxen group (RR: 4.98 CI: 0.58, 42.57). The overall rates of thrombotic events were similar 10/2785 vs. 7/2772 (RR: 1.42 CI: 0.54, 3.73) but more patients experienced a stroke in the naproxen group 0/2785 vs. 6/2772 (RR: 0.08 CI 0.00, 1.36). Numerically more patients in the rofecoxib group experienced hypertension (RR: 1.22 CI: 0.89, 1.68). Subgroup analyses of patients with pre-existing hypertension indicated that the incidence of CV adverse events was higher in these patients but the difference was not statistically significant.</P>
<P>The overall withdrawals due to adverse events were similar 757/2785 vs. 788/2772 (RR: 0.96 CI: 0.86, 1.10), as were the number of patients withdrawing due to laboratory test adverse events 11/2799 vs 5/2787 (RR: 2.19 CI: 0.76, 6.29). The rofecoxib group experienced fewer discontinuations due to GI adverse events; the survival curve separated at 3 weeks and there were statistically significant differences over whole course of study (RR: 0.74; 95% CI: 0.60, 0.92). The cumulative incidence of concomitant GI medication use was statistically significantly lower in the rofecoxib group both at six weeks (RR: 0.80 CI: 0.66, 0.97) and twelve weeks (RR: 0.81 CI: 0.69, 0.95). There were 2 PUBs reported in the rofecoxib group compared to 9 in the naproxen group (RR: 0.22 CI 0.05, 1.02), although it must be borne in mind that patients could take concomitant GI protective medications (PPI, antacids or H2blockers). An abstract presented at the ACR conference (New Orleans 2002) stated that there were 6 PUBs in the rofecoxib group compared to 12 in the naproxen and that respectively 2 and 9 were confirmed by an independent adjudication committee (Geba 2002). In the 15% of patients who had previously stopped NSAID therapy because of GI intolerance, the results of discontinuation due to GI adverse events also favoured rofecoxib (reported RR: 0.53; 95% CI: 0.34, 0.84).</P>
<P>Sub-group analyses were conducted for ADVANTAGE patients receiving low dose aspirin <LINK REF="STD-Advantage-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Advantage 2000</LINK>. The authors however state that it was not powered to be conclusive. As with the entire study population, there were fewer withdrawals due to GI events in patients taking rofecoxib but the difference was not statistically significant 17/352 vs. 31/367 (RR: 0.57 CI: 0.32, 1.01). An analysis of interaction by treatment with low-dose aspirin was also undertaken that indicated no statistically significant modification of effect (p=0.378), which the authors state indicated a consistent risk reduction regardless of aspirin use. Again, there is no analysis of whether these patients were also taking concomitant GI medication but the authors report that there was no statistically significant difference in the reduction in concomitant use of GI medication in the aspirin patients (RR: 0.82 CI: 0.57, 1.18).</P>
<P>The CRESCENT study reported that "at week 6, rofecoxib induced a significant increase in 24-hour systolic blood pressure (+4.2 mm Hg), whereas celecoxib and naproxen did not (-0.1 and -0.8 mmHg respectively; p=0.005). Week 12 results were comparable to week 6." No further data were presented <LINK REF="STD-CRESCENT-_x0028_Sowers_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">CRESCENT (Sowers)</LINK>.</P>
<P>
<B>5. ROFECOXIB VERSUS NABUMETONE</B>
<BR/>Three 6-week double-blind, placebo-controlled RCTs were identified that compared rofecoxib to nabumetone. Two of the RCTs were identical in design; whilst one has only been published in abstract form <LINK REF="STD-Geba-_x0028_MSD-090_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Geba (MSD 090)</LINK>, the second has recently been published in full <LINK REF="STD-Kivitz-2004_x0028_MSD-085_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Kivitz 2004(MSD 085)</LINK>. The two RCTs compared rofecoxib 12.5mg daily to nabumetone 1000mg daily and enrolled 978 and 1042 patients with OA of the knee aged 40 or over.</P>
<P>The third RCT was conducted in 341 patients aged 80 years or older (mean age 83) and over six weeks compared rofecoxib 12.5mg and 25mg to nabumetone 1500mg and placebo <LINK REF="STD-Truitt-2001_x0028_MSD-058_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Truitt 2001(MSD 058)</LINK>. Although the publication does not state that it was double-blind, double dummies were used and safety evaluations were undertaken by a blinded assessor.</P>
<P>
<B>5.1 EFFICACY</B>
<BR/>The RCT conducted in elderly patients indicated similar responses across the patient groups, with no statistically significant differences reported between the active treatment groups in any of the outcome measures. A time-course analysis of changes indicated that the treatment effects were generally at a constant level <LINK REF="STD-Truitt-2001_x0028_MSD-058_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Truitt 2001(MSD 058)</LINK>.</P>
<P>With respect to the two six-week RCTs, the only efficacy results that could be pooled were the number of patients reporting good or excellent response, which was greater in the rofecoxib 12.5mg group (RR: 1.17 CI: 1.05, 1.29).</P>
<P>MSD 085 indicated that patients receiving rofecoxib were more likely to have a good or excellent response over the 6 weeks as assessed by the patient global response to therapy <LINK REF="STD-Kivitz-2004_x0028_MSD-085_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Kivitz 2004(MSD 085)</LINK>. Sensitivity analysis examining the numbers of individuals completing the study rather than using the modified ITT analysis indicated the same. Sub-group analysis conducted in patients over the age of 65 indicated this was also the case, and the results were compatible with the overall cohort (treatment by age interaction p=0.893). Results were however presented as an average over the whole treatment period with no endpoint results given. Both active groups had mean increases from baseline in each QoL domain on the SF36, which were significant, compared to placebo, for six of the eight domains (not physical function and mental health). Fewer patients taking rofecoxib withdrew due to lack of efficacy (RR: 0.64 CI: 0.41, 0.98).</P>
<P>The publication also presents results on onset of efficacy although both actives were reported to be quicker than placebo, no statistical comparison between rofecoxib and nabumetone was presented. The results also should be treated with caution as this assessment was initiated after the trial had started and was only used in 55.1% of patients. The publication also reported median time to first report of good or excellent PGART response, which was 2 days in the rofecoxib group compared to 4 in the nabumetone (comparison p=0.02) and greater than 5 in the placebo. Overall similar number of patients used paracetamol and the average number of tablets taken was also comparable. The interpretation of the secondary endpoints is uncertain as although there was a statistically significant difference in the walking pain score in favour of rofecoxib, it was based on average of week 2, 4 and 6 scores rather than the endpoint. Again onset of efficacy results were presented, but were only collected in 55.1% of the total cohort. The average onset over the 6 days was statistically significantly greater in the rofecoxib compared to the nabumetone.</P>
<P>The abstract of MSD 090 does not provide sufficient data for analysis of the results <LINK REF="STD-Geba-_x0028_MSD-090_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Geba (MSD 090)</LINK>. The authors report that rofecoxib was superior to nabumetone in the treatment of OA over six weeks as determined by the PGART and 'relief of pain walking on a flat surface'. They also note that rofecoxib had a more rapid onset of efficacy over the first six days compared to nabumetone. A pooled analysis of the results of the two studies has been presented as posters at conferences.</P>
<P>
<B>5.2 SAFETY</B>
<BR/>Pooled analysis of the results from the 6-week studies, indicated no difference in the rates of withdrawals due to adverse events (RR: 1.24 CI: 0.84, 1.84), total adverse events (RR: 1.09 CI: 0.99, 1.20), serious adverse events (RR: 1.28 CI: 0.57, 2.89), lower extremity oedema (RR: 1.41 CI: 0.72, 2.77) and hypertension (RR: 1.46 CI: 0.53, 4.12). The Kivitz report also states that no patient experienced a gastrointestinal perforation or ulceration <LINK REF="STD-Kivitz-2004_x0028_MSD-085_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Kivitz 2004(MSD 085)</LINK>. Two lower GI bleeds (anorectal haemorrhage and lower GI haemorrhage) occurred but neither was attributed to a study drug. The authors also report that concomitant aspirin use did not appear to increase the rates of adverse events but no sub-group data were presented.</P>
<P>The Truitt report states that there were no gastro-duodenal perforations, ulcers or haemorrhages in the study <LINK REF="STD-Truitt-2001_x0028_MSD-058_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Truitt 2001(MSD 058)</LINK>. There were no data given for either total number of adverse events or total GI adverse events. Conflicting statements state that one or two cases of congestive heart failure occurred in patients taking nabumetone. There were no significant differences in the rates of lower extremity oedema (both overall, and those attributed to drug treatment).</P>
<P>
<B>6. ROFECOXIB VERSUS DICLOFENAC/ MISOPROSTOL</B>
<BR/>One RCT was identified that compared the 6-week tolerability profile of rofecoxib 12.5mg once daily with twice daily diclofenac 50mg/misoprostol 200mcg. The trial enrolled 483 patients aged 40 years or over with OA. Double-dummy placebo was used to maintain blinding <LINK REF="STD-Acevedo-2001_x0028_MSD902_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Acevedo 2001(MSD902)</LINK>.</P>
<P>
<B>5.1 EFFICACY</B>
<BR/>There were no significant differences in the 6-week change from baseline of the global disease status as measured by the patient or the investigator <LINK REF="STD-Acevedo-2001_x0028_MSD902_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Acevedo 2001(MSD902)</LINK>. One patient in each group withdrew due to lack of efficacy.</P>
<P>
<B>5.2 SAFETY</B>
<BR/>At 6 weeks in the rofecoxib group there were significantly fewer GI adverse events (70/242 vs. 117/241 RR: 0.60 CI: 0.47, 0.75) and significantly fewer patients with one or more episodes of diarrhoea (15/242 vs. 48/241 RR: 0.31 CI: 0.18, 0.54) <LINK REF="STD-Acevedo-2001_x0028_MSD902_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Acevedo 2001(MSD902)</LINK>. The cumulative incidence of diarrhoea over the whole study was greater in the Arthrotec group (RR 0.29 CI: 0.16, 0.51). Rates of abdominal pain were numerically lower in the rofecoxib group (21/242 vs. 32/241) RR: 0.65 CI 0.39, 1.10). The overall rates of adverse events were rofecoxib 128/242 vs. Arthrotec 176/241 (RR: 0.72 CI: 0.63, 0.83) and significantly more people in the Arthrotec group withdrew due to adverse events 10/242 v 22/241 (RR: 0.45 95% CI: 0.2, 0.9). The proportion of people experiencing serious adverse events was similar across the two groups; 3/242 vs. 4/241 (RR: 0.75 CI 0.17, 3.30). Five individuals in each group experienced lower extremity oedema and the rates of cardiovascular events were 14/242 in the rofecoxib group and 10/241 in the Arthrotec group (RR: 1.39 CI: 0.63, 3.08). The authors reported that for all safety outcomes, patients with and without a positive GI history (previous GI ulcer or bleed) responded similarly to treatment, as indicated by a non-significant treatment by stratum interactions.

<B>7. ROFECOXIB VERSUS NIMESULIDE</B>
<BR/>Two double-blind RCTs were identified that compared rofecoxib to nimesulide in OA of the knee. A Venezuelan RCT compared 30 days treatment with 25mg rofecoxib daily to 300mg nimesulide (slow release formulation) in 114 patients aged over 50 years <LINK REF="STD-Herrera-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Herrera 2003</LINK>. The number of patients in each assessment is not however clear. The second Italian study enrolled 30 patients and had a cross-over design with patients sequentially receiving 7 days treatment with 25mg rofecoxib, 200mg celecoxib and 100mg nimesulide <LINK REF="STD-Bianchi-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Bianchi 2003</LINK>. The order in which they received the drugs was determined by randomisation. However, the paper does not report any wash-out period between the study arms, which may have compromised the results; although no differences were observed in any of the baseline measurements in each period. For additional pain relief, patients were also allowed 500mg paracetamol 12 hours after the test drug.</P>
<P>Due to the differences in the dose of nimesulide used, the methodology and the timings of data collection, no meta-analysis of efficacy or safety data could be performed. The results of individual studies are therefore discussed below.</P>
<P>
<B>7.1 EFFICACY</B>
<BR/>The Venezuelan study indicated that there was no statistically significant difference between the groups after 15 days, although the nimesulide group had a more favourable response after 30 days of treatment (p=0.009) using the WOMAC scale <LINK REF="STD-Herrera-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Herrera 2003</LINK>. Similar differences were found with the VAS pain score and the evaluation of response by the investigator (RR: 0.77 CI: 0.61, 0.97) and patients (RR: 0.83 CI: 0.67, 1.03). Analgesic rescue medication was similar in both groups. The nimesulide had a faster onset of action (15 minutes versus 45 minutes), which could be attributed to the formulation. Two patients in each group withdrew due to LOE (RR: 1.00 CI: 0.15, 6.86).</P>
<P>The Italian cross-over study presented data in graphical form only, but reported that as measured by the patient on a 100mm VAS, nimesulide 100mg showed a significantly greater analgesic effect over the first 3 hours of treatment (p&lt;0.001) and at the end of the first and seventh day of treatment (p&lt;0.001) than either rofecoxib 25mg or celecoxib 200mg <LINK REF="STD-Bianchi-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Bianchi 2003</LINK>. Nimesulide also had a significantly faster onset of action than either rofecoxib or celecoxib on day 1 and 7, with the reduction in pain from baseline reaching significance after 15 minutes compared to 60 minutes. The pain associated with walking 12 hours after each dose was taken was significantly less in the nimesulide group on day 1 but not on day 7. However, more patients reported paracetamol use at least once during the study when taking nimesulide; 6 patients versus 4 taking paracetamol when taking rofecoxib and celecoxib. Most data were presented in graphical form only apart from the percentage of patients reporting good or very good analgesic efficacy, which was 16/30 in the nimesulide group and 15/30 in the rofecoxib group (RR: 0.94 CI: 0.57, 1.53).</P>
<P>The pooled relative risk for the number of patients taking additional paracetamol was not significantly different between rofecoxib and nimesulide (RR: 0.95 CI: 0.54,1.68).</P>
<P>
<B>7.2 SAFETY</B>
<BR/>The Venezuelan study reported that only three adverse events occurred, none of which required withdrawal from treatment; one patient experienced heartburn and dizziness in the nimesulide group and two patients developed pyresis in the rofecoxib group <LINK REF="STD-Herrera-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Herrera 2003</LINK>. Only the patient global assessment of tolerability was reported in the Italian study; when the patients were receiving rofecoxib or nimesulide, 23/30 reported tolerability as being good or excellent compared to 23/30 when they were receiving nimesulide <LINK REF="STD-Bianchi-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Bianchi 2003</LINK>. One patient reported poor tolerability when taking nimesulide. The report states that no patients withdrew due to serious adverse events.</P>
<P>
<B>8. ROFECOXIB versus CELECOXIB</B>
<BR/>A total of nine double-blind RCTs were identified that compared rofecoxib 25mg daily to celecoxib 200mg daily (i.e. higher recommended therapeutic dose rofecoxib vs. lower recommended therapeutic dose celecoxib). Seven of the nine RCTs were 6-week studies (not <LINK REF="STD-Bianchi-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Bianchi 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-CRESCENT-_x0028_Sowers_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">CRESCENT (Sowers)</LINK>), which facilitated meta-analysis. Other comparators included in the trials were rofecoxib 12.5mg (<LINK REF="STD-VACT" TYPE="STUDY">VACT</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-VACT-2" TYPE="STUDY">VACT 2</LINK>) nimesulide (<LINK REF="STD-Bianchi-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Bianchi 2003</LINK>)naproxen (<LINK REF="STD-CRESCENT-_x0028_Sowers_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">CRESCENT (Sowers)</LINK>), placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Gibofsky-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Gibofsky 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McKenna-2000" TYPE="STUDY">McKenna 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schnitzer-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Schnitzer 2001</LINK>) and paracetamol (<LINK REF="STD-VACT" TYPE="STUDY">VACT</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-VACT-2" TYPE="STUDY">VACT 2</LINK>).</P>
<P>Five of the nine were sponsored by the manufacturers of celecoxib (Pharmacia/Pfizer); four have been published in full <LINK REF="STD-Gibofsky-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Gibofsky 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McKenna-2000" TYPE="STUDY">McKenna 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-SUCCESS-VI" TYPE="STUDY">SUCCESS VI</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-SUCCESS-VII" TYPE="STUDY">SUCCESS VII</LINK> and one in abstract form <LINK REF="STD-CRESCENT-_x0028_Sowers_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">CRESCENT (Sowers)</LINK>. Three RCTs; <LINK REF="STD-VACT" TYPE="STUDY">VACT</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-VACT-2" TYPE="STUDY">VACT 2</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schnitzer-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Schnitzer 2001</LINK> were sponsored by the manufacturers of rofecoxib (MSD) and only one has been published in full (<LINK REF="STD-VACT" TYPE="STUDY">VACT</LINK>). One of the RCTs did not acknowledge any pharmaceutical company sponsorship <LINK REF="STD-Bianchi-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Bianchi 2003</LINK>. It had a cross-over design and compared three seven day periods of treatment with rofecoxib, celecoxib and nimesulide.</P>
<P>Three of the Pharmacia/Pfizer studies were specifically designed to examine cardio-renal effects and therefore did not collect efficacy data; two have been published in full <LINK REF="STD-SUCCESS-VI" TYPE="STUDY">SUCCESS VI</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-SUCCESS-VII" TYPE="STUDY">SUCCESS VII</LINK> and one only in abstract form <LINK REF="STD-CRESCENT-_x0028_Sowers_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">CRESCENT (Sowers)</LINK>.</P>
<P>
<B>8.1 EFFICACY</B>
<BR/>Pooled analysis of withdrawals due to lack of efficacy found no statistically significant difference between rofecoxib 25mg and celecoxib 200mg after 6 weeks (RR: 0.76 CI: 0.47, 1.24). The <LINK REF="STD-VACT" TYPE="STUDY">VACT</LINK> trial also found no statistically significant differences between rofecoxib 12.5mg and celecoxib 200mg. Due to lack of reported similar outcome data, no pooling of WOMAC data was possible other than the function subscale results reported in Gibofsky and <LINK REF="STD-VACT" TYPE="STUDY">VACT</LINK> (RR: 0.12 CI: -2.41, 2.66). The <LINK REF="STD-VACT" TYPE="STUDY">VACT</LINK> trial found rofecoxib to be statistically significant superior on the pain and stiffness subscales and the rest-pain and night-pain at the 25mg dose, but not at the 12.5mg dose.</P>
<P>Data on the patient global response to therapy could be pooled, which indicated more patients on 25mg rofecoxib had a good or excellent improvement (RR: 1.14 CI: 1.05, 1.24), but again this difference can be attributed to the higher therapeutic dose used. Pooled data from three trials indicated no difference in the use of paracetamol rescue (RR: 1.07 CI: 0.65, 1.75).</P>
<P>The abstract for the <LINK REF="STD-CRESCENT-_x0028_Sowers_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">CRESCENT (Sowers)</LINK> study reported that the "arthritis assessments demonstrated that changes in total WOMAC were similar for all 3 treatments at week 6 (p=0.4) and week 12 (p=0.39)". No data were provided.</P>
<P>
<B>8.2 SAFETY</B>
<BR/>Meta-analysis of safety data could be performed on the number of withdrawals and the incidence of adverse events.</P>
<P>There were no differences in the either the total number of withdrawals (RR: 0.93 CI: 0.76, 1.14) or the number of withdrawals due to adverse events (RR: 1.03 CI: 0.77, 1.39) between 25mg rofecoxib and 200mg celecoxib. Data from two trials on withdrawals due to cardio-renal adverse effects did not indicate any difference (RR: 1.33, CI: 0.58, 3.07) and neither the <LINK REF="STD-SUCCESS-VI" TYPE="STUDY">SUCCESS VI</LINK> or <LINK REF="STD-Schnitzer-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Schnitzer 2001</LINK> reported any significant difference in the rates of individual withdrawals due to specific cardiovascular events. Only <LINK REF="STD-McKenna-2000" TYPE="STUDY">McKenna 2000</LINK> reported the number of withdrawals due to GI events (RR: 4.27 CI: 0.49, 37.12).</P>
<P>The total incidence of adverse effects was similar in the rofecoxib 25mg group and the celecoxib 200mg group (RR:1.04 CI: 0.95, 1.14). There were no statistically significant differences in the rates of serious adverse events (RR: 3.51, CI: 0.73, 16.84)</P>
<P>Very few studies reported on the rates of GI events; there were more GI events in the rofecoxib 25mg group in <LINK REF="STD-McKenna-2000" TYPE="STUDY">McKenna 2000</LINK> (RR: 3.05 CI: 1.39, 6.68). Pooling was possible for the incidence of diarrhoea (RR: 0.79, CI: 0.40, 1.57) and dyspepsia (RR: 1.24 CI: 0.82, 1.89).</P>
<P>The pooled data indicated more cardio-renal effects in the rofecoxib 25mg group: oedema (RR: 1.77 CI: 1.27, 2.47), systolic blood pressure increase (RR: 1.54 CI:1.24, 1.90) [NB heterogeneous]. The results were non-significant for diastolic blood pressure increase (RR: 1.55, CI: 0.91, 2.63), CHF (RR: 3.06 CI: 0.73, 12.72), and hypertension (RR: 3.51 CI: 0.73, 16.84). <LINK REF="STD-SUCCESS-VI" TYPE="STUDY">SUCCESS VI</LINK> also reported a significantly greater increase in systolic blood pressure from baseline (WMD 3.30 CI: 1.89, 4.71). Similarly, <LINK REF="STD-CRESCENT-_x0028_Sowers_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">CRESCENT (Sowers)</LINK> reported "at week 6, rofecoxib induced a significant increase in 24-hour systolic blood pressure (+4.2 mm Hg), whereas celecoxib did not (-0.1 mmHg p=0.005). Week 12 results were comparable to week 6. " No further data were presented.</P>
<P>The difference between rofecoxib and celecoxib in the numbers of patients experiencing clinically significant systolic blood pressure and oedema was not evident in studies conducted in standard populations <LINK REF="STD-Gibofsky-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Gibofsky 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-VACT" TYPE="STUDY">VACT</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schnitzer-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Schnitzer 2001</LINK>.</P>
<P>
<B>9. ROFECOXIB versus PARACETAMOL</B>
<BR/>Two RCTs (<LINK REF="STD-VACT" TYPE="STUDY">VACT</LINK> 1 and <LINK REF="STD-VACT-2" TYPE="STUDY">VACT 2</LINK>) were identified that compared rofecoxib 12.5mg or 25mg per day to paracetamol 4g/day in a total of 1960 patients. <LINK REF="STD-VACT" TYPE="STUDY">VACT</LINK> 1 (382 patients) was the pilot study and to date <LINK REF="STD-VACT-2" TYPE="STUDY">VACT 2</LINK> (1579 patients) has only been published in abstract form.<BR/>No meta-analysis was possible therefore the results of the two trials are discussed individually.</P>
<P>
<B>9.1 EFFICACY</B>
<BR/>In <LINK REF="STD-VACT" TYPE="STUDY">VACT</LINK> 1 after 6 weeks treatment, there were no statistically significant differences between rofecoxib 12.5mg and paracetamol. However rofecoxib 25mg showed greater efficacy than paracetamol as measured by all WOMAC scales and composite subscales. The Patient Global Response to therapy also indicated that more patients taking rofecoxib (both 12.5 and 25mg per day) had a good or excellent response (RR: 1.44; CI: 1.06, 1.97) and (RR: 1.54; CI: 1.14, 2.08) respectively. More patients in the paracetamol group withdrew than either the rofecoxib groups, which was primarily driven by withdrawals due to lack of efficacy 12.5 mg (RR 0.49 CI: 0.22, 1.09) and 25mg (RR 0.49 CI: 0.22, 1.10). The publication also reported results in the first 6 days; both rofecoxib doses achieved statistically significant differences compared to paracetamol on WOMAC scales (night pain, pain on walking, rest pain and morning stiffness).<BR/>As <LINK REF="STD-VACT-2" TYPE="STUDY">VACT 2</LINK> has only been published in abstract form, very few data are available. It reported that "improvements in WOMAC subscales over 6 weeks were significantly greater with all coxibs versus ACET (paracetamol) p-values &lt; or =0.01)". <LINK REF="STD-Geba-_x0028_MSD-090_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Geba (MSD 090)</LINK>

<P>
<B>9.2 SAFETY</B>
<BR/>No safety data for <LINK REF="STD-VACT-2" TYPE="STUDY">VACT 2</LINK> are available.<BR/>No patient enrolled in <LINK REF="STD-VACT" TYPE="STUDY">VACT</LINK> 1 experienced either a PUB or a MI during the trial. However, 2 patients withdrew due to oedema; 1 in the rofecoxib 25mg group and 1 receiving celecoxib. Similar numbers of patients withdrew due to adverse events and there were no statistically significant differences in the rates of individual adverse events. Overall rates of GI adverse events were not reported. Similarly the overall rates of serious adverse events were not reported in the main publication, but the abstract presented at EULAR indicated that 2 patients in each rofecoxib group (12.5 mg and 25mg) experienced a serious adverse event compared to none in the paracetamol group (RR 4.90 CI: 0.24, 100.66).</P>
<P>
<B>10. ROFECOXIB DOSE RESPONSE</B>
<BR/>Twelve RCTs included comparisons from different doses of rofecoxib, therefore some meta-analysis could be undertaken <LINK REF="STD-Cannon-2000_x0028_MSD-035_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Cannon 2000(MSD 035)</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Day-2000-_x0028_MSD-040_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Day 2000 (MSD 040)</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ehrich-1999-_x0028_pilot_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Ehrich 1999 (pilot)</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ehrich-2001_x0028_MSD-029_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Ehrich 2001(MSD 029)</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hawkey-2000_x0028_MSD-045_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Hawkey 2000(MSD 045)</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Laine-1999-_x0028_MSD-044_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Laine 1999 (MSD 044)</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moskowitz--2003" TYPE="STUDY">Moskowitz 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Saag-1998-_x0028_MSD-033_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Saag 1998 (MSD 033)</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Saag-2000-_x0028_MSD-034_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Saag 2000 (MSD 034)</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Truitt-2001_x0028_MSD-058_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Truitt 2001(MSD 058)</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-VACT" TYPE="STUDY">VACT</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-VACT-2" TYPE="STUDY">VACT 2</LINK>.</P>
<P>
<B>10.1 EFFICACY</B>
</P>
<P>Pooled data from six trials indicated that there were fewer withdrawals due to lack of efficacy (LOE) in the 25mg group but the result was not significant (RR 0.66 CI: 0.42, 1.03).</P>
<P>
<B>10.2 SAFETY</B>
<BR/>Rates of adverse events and withdrawals due to adverse events appeared similar across the doses examined. The only statistically significant result was that after one year more patients in the 25mg group had experienced diarrhoea compared to those in the 12.5mg group (RR: 1.74; CI: 1.00, 3.02).</P>

</INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>In October 2004, Merck voluntarily withdrew rofecoxib after analysis of an ongoing trial of the use of rofecoxib in 2600 patients for the prevention of adenomatous colon polyps indicated that 3.5% of the patients in the rofecoxib group experienced a myocardial infarction or stroke compared to 1.9% of the patients assigned to placebo (p&lt;0.001). </P>
<P>The worldwide withdrawal of rofecoxib was the culmination of growing concern over the adverse renovascular effects of rofecoxib that began after the 1999 publication of the 'Vioxx Gastrointestinal Outcomes Research (VIGOR) trial <LINK REF="REF-Bombardier-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bombardier 2000</LINK>. VIGOR enrolled 658 patients with rheumatoid arthritis and the results indicated that patients receiving rofecoxib were more at risk of experiencing a myocardial infarction than those receiving naproxen. There was much debate as to whether this was a result of detrimental effects of rofecoxib or an aspirin-like cardio-protective effect of naproxen <LINK REF="REF-Garner-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Garner 2004</LINK> . The ensuing controversy prompted a number of pooled analyses and epidemiological studies that came to various conclusions <LINK REF="STD-Gertz-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Gertz 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Konstam-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Konstam 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Reicin-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Reicin 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mamdani-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mamdani 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mamdani-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mamdani 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Weir--2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weir 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ray-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ray 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Solomon-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Solomon 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Layton-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Layton 2003</LINK>. </P>
<P>The FDA Arthritis Advisory Committee met to discuss the cardiovascular risks of rofecoxib in February 2001 and requested that a warning be included in the information for patients. A subsequent large epidemiological study was sponsored <LINK REF="REF-Mamdani-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mamdani 2002</LINK> <LINK REF="REF-Mamdani-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mamdani 2004</LINK>. In July 2002, the European regulatory authority (EMEA), undertook a review of the safety of the five then available coxibs (celecoxib, etoricoxib, parecoxib, rofecoxib and valdecoxib), which was completed in late 2003. It broadly concluded that the "the benefit/risk balance of medicinal products containing celecoxib, etoricoxib, parecoxib, rofecoxib and valdecoxib remains favourable" and that "available data indicated that a significant and consistent gastrointestinal benefit of Cox-2 inhibitors compared with conventional NSAIDs had not been demonstrated". It was also recommended that each Summary of Product characteristics should be updated with warnings relating to the GI safety, the risk of myocardial infarction and the observed or potential serious skin effects and hypersensitivity. A further review of the safety, prompted by the withdrawal of rofecoxib, is ongoing at the time this Cochrane review was written.</P>
<P>Although rofecoxib has been withdrawn, there is much ongoing debate as to whether the adverse cardio-vascular effects are specific to rofecoxib or whether it is a class effect. This requires an understanding of the pharmacology of the individual drugs and the causes of the adverse events associated with all NSAIDs. In broad terms, the toxicity of NSAIDs is variable amongst patients and drugs and it tends to be dose related and associated with variation in the mode of action, absorption, distribution and metabolism.<BR/> <BR/>It is accepted that NSAID inhibition of the prostaglandin pathway causes alterations in renal function. A number of mechanisms have been suggested including salt and water retention, increased total peripheral vascular resistance due to inhibition of PGE2 and PGI2, and increased endothelin-1 secretion. The most commonly reported renal effect is fluid retention and it is estimated that overall approximately 5% of individuals taking NSAIDs will have clinically detectable fluid retention <LINK REF="REF-Whelton-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Whelton 1991</LINK>. A number of studies have also examined the effect of NSAIDs on blood pressure and blood pressure control in hypertensives. It has been estimated that NSAID treatment increases blood pressure by 3-5mmHg, but there are variations amongst individual NSAIDs, with drugs with an increased half-life presenting an increased risk .</P>
<P>Although the mechanism by which renal function is affected is not fully understood, research has indicated that Cox plays a role. Although it was thought initially that Cox II was produced only as a result of inflammation, further research indicated that under normal circumstances it is found in the kidney and plays and important role in maintaining renal haemodynamics and the regulation of sodium and water excretion. Inhibition of Cox II has been shown to cause sodium retention, hyperkaliemia and water intoxication. Therefore whilst selective Cox II inhibition reduces the incidence of GI events (which would be caused by Cox I inhibition) because it plays a role in reducing aggregation of platelets, there is a theoretical possibility that the resultant suppression of prostacylin production and unopposed thromboxane production, leads to an increases the risk of cardiovascular thrombotic events. Therefore the risk-benefit profile of individual NSAIDs will depend on both the relative Cox I to Cox II inhibition and the absolute inhibition of Cox I.</P>
<P>A number of studies have examined the Cox inhibitory profiles of individual NSAIDs using surrogate markers <LINK REF="REF-Van-Hecken-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van Hecken 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Simon-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Simon 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Glaser-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glaser 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kawai-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kawai 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Reindeau-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reindeau 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Warner-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Warner 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Brooks-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brooks 1999</LINK>. The findings of individual studies vary, which can be attributed to differences in the experimental methodology; this makes comparisons and the resultant 'rankings' difficult to interpret. Whilst most studies concentrated on the relative inhibitory activity against Cox I and II, some examined absolute levels of inhibition. Warner et al separated rofecoxib into the category of drug that strongly inhibited Cox II with weak activity against Cox I (&gt;50-fold Cox II selective), whilst other Cox II selective agents (celecoxib, etodolac, meloxicam and nimesulide) were classed as compounds that were capable of producing full inhibition of Cox I and Cox II with preference toward Cox II (5 to 50 fold Cox II selective) <LINK REF="REF-Warner-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Warner 1999</LINK>. The authors also stressed that because all of the drugs in this latter group are capable of inhibition of Cox I, therefore increasing dose could increase GI toxicity <LINK REF="REF-Warner-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Warner 1999</LINK>.</P>
<P>With respect to the discussion of the findings of this systematic review, it is worthwhile noting that meta-analysis was hampered by the inadequate reporting of outcomes in some trials. Of particular concern, in drugs that are purported to have GI benefits, is the absence of GI event data. Across the studies, a wide range of efficacy outcome measures were used, and the lack of standardisation of outcome assessment reporting (i.e. pre- and post-treatment scores, change with treatment and percentage change with treatment) and inadequacy of reporting of outcomes (i.e. measure of variance was often not provided), meant that in many instances, it was not possible to statistically pool efficacy results. The focus of the discussions in the publications also tended to be on the statistical significance of the results rather than on the clinical significance. When interpreting the results it must be borne in mind that it has been estimated that moderate improvement in OA is defined as a 10-20 point reduction on a 0-100 interval scale <LINK REF="REF-Ehrich-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ehrich 2000</LINK>. </P>
<P>In this review the data for different doses of drugs and for different types of NSAID in the comparator arm have been separated, as there is evidence to suggest that individual NSAIDs have different toxicity profiles. Meta-analyses of NSAID associated toxicity have demonstrated that low dose ibuprofen carries the lowest risk of GI complications with comparative relative risks of 2 for fenoprofen, aspirin and diclofenac and 2-3 for sulindac, diflusinal, naproxen, indomethacin and tolmetin and above 3 by piroxicam, ketoprofen and azopropazone <LINK REF="REF-Henry-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Henry 1996</LINK>. Another study conducted using the GPRD database found that ibuprofen again was associated with the lowest relative risk of upper GI bleeding 2.9 (95% CI: 1.7, 5.0) with naproxen 3.1 (95% CI:1.7, 5.9) and diclofenac 3.9 (95% CI: 2.3, 6.5) <LINK REF="REF-Lanes-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lanes 2000</LINK>.</P>
<P>The use of different doses may similarly affect the outcomes of comparisons and they have therefore been considered separately. Epidemiological studies have shown that GI toxicity varies by a factor of 3 to 10 over the ranges of recommended doses, depending on the NSAID under investigation <LINK REF="REF-Lanes-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lanes 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Langman-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Langman 1994</LINK>. High doses are more toxic than lower doses with the odds ratio for NSAID associated ulcer complications ranging from 2.5 on low to 8.5 on high <LINK REF="REF-Langman-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Langman 1994</LINK> ibuprofen and indomethacin, independent of duration of exposure <LINK REF="REF-Lanes-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lanes 2000</LINK>.</P>
<P>As expected, in the placebo-controlled trials, rofecoxib showed consistently superior efficacy to placebo and higher doses were effective in more people than lower doses. Rofecoxib in general caused more adverse events than placebo, although there was a lot of variability in the results of individual trials and some of the results were not statistically significant. The rates of overall GI events were not well recorded, but in general the risk of symptoms was not statistically different, although one trial reported rofecoxib 25mg to cause more GI events <LINK REF="STD-Kivitz-2004_x0028_MSD-085_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Kivitz 2004(MSD 085)</LINK> (RR 3.39 CI: 1.47, 7.84). Only two PUBs were reported in the trials; one in a rofecoxib group and one in a placebo group. The reporting of serious events varied considerably between the trials; meta-analysis of data from four trials using a 12.5mg dose indicated an increased risk of serious adverse events (RR 3.95 CI: 1.05, 14.63). The reno-vascular events were evident, but as previously mentioned are common to all NSAIDs; few trials reported such data. Rofecoxib (25mg) caused statistically significantly more patients with an increase in systolic blood pressure after 6 weeks (RR 2.89 CI: 1.17, 7.14) and the 12.5 mg dose patients experienced more lower- extremity oedema (RR 2.40 CI: 1.05, 5.48). There was heterogeneity in the results of the endoscopic studies; with one study consistently showing more ulcers in the placebo group <LINK REF="STD-Laine-1999-_x0028_MSD-044_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Laine 1999 (MSD 044)</LINK> and one in the rofecoxib group <LINK REF="STD-Hawkey-2000_x0028_MSD-045_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Hawkey 2000(MSD 045)</LINK>. Dose comparisons indicated that rofecoxib 50mg caused more endoscopic ulcers than rofecoxib 25mg and additional analyses indicated that there was an increased risk of gastric ulcers compared to duodenal. Very few PUBs were reported.</P>
<P>There were no consistent differences in efficacy between rofecoxib and any of the comparators, including celecoxib. Although there were some statistically significant results, in general these could be attributed to the dosages of the drugs that were compared. For example rofecoxib 25mg was found to be more effective than paracetamol 4g/day, but 12.5mg rofecoxib was not.</P>
<P>With respect to GI symptoms, considering this is the key benefit of these drugs, it was surprising that very few of the trials reported event data to allow adequate consideration of the results. The only statistically significant results were that rofecoxib caused less GI pain than diclofenac in two RCTs. Naproxen, the most GI toxic of the NSAID comparators, caused more withdrawals due to GI events, total GI events and fewer PUBS, and fewer patients used concomitant GI medication. There was insufficient data presented in the publications of the trials that compared rofecoxib to nimesulide or nabumetone to enable any discussion. Rofecoxib 25mg caused more withdrawals due to GI events (RR 4.27 CI: 0.49, 37.12) and GI events (RR 3.05 CI 1.39, 6.68) than 200mg celecoxib after 6 weeks, but this comparison was based on high dose rofecoxib versus low dose celecoxib. Rofecoxib caused less diarrhoea than misoprostol/diclofenac, but again this is to be expected as diarrhoea is a common side-effect of misoprostol <LINK REF="STD-Acevedo-2001_x0028_MSD902_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Acevedo 2001(MSD902)</LINK>. The two endoscopic trials indicated that rofecoxib 25mg and 50 mg was associated with statistically significant fewer gastric ulcers than ibuprofen, and 25mg rofecoxib caused fewer duodenal ulcers <LINK REF="STD-Hawkey-2000_x0028_MSD-045_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Hawkey 2000(MSD 045)</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Laine-1999-_x0028_MSD-044_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Laine 1999 (MSD 044)</LINK>. Similarly rofecoxib was found to cause fewer erosions. In interpreting the data from these endoscopic studies, consideration must be given to the fact that the link between endoscopically detected ulcers and clinical symptoms has not been fully described and gastrointestinal symptoms are often poorly correlated with endoscopic findings <LINK REF="REF-Singh-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Singh 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Larkai-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Larkai 1989</LINK>.</P>
<P>Analysis of other adverse event data found that there was no statistically significant difference in the number of patients experiencing an adverse event between rofecoxib and any other active comparator, other than Arthrotec, which as previously mentioned is associated with diarrhoea. Again only a few of the trials reported this outcome. There were more withdrawals due to adverse events compared to placebo and 50mg rofecoxib caused more than 25mg. Rofecoxib patients had fewer adverse events than diclofenac after one year and fewer than ibuprofen at 16 weeks. Fewer trials reported on the number of serious adverse events, and this outcome was not reported in any of the diclofenac, ibuprofen or nimesulide comparisons. As expected there were more in the placebo trials, although it was only significant at 12.5mg dose. There were no difference in the reported rates of serious adverse events of rofecoxib compared to naproxen, nabumetone, paracetamol and celecoxib.</P>
<P>Four studies were identified that specifically examined the cardiorenal safety of rofecoxib; three were comparisons of high dose rofecoxib (25mg) and low dose celecoxib (200mg) and were sponsored by Pharmacia/Pfizer. The fourth study did not acknowledge any sponsorship and examined rofecoxib vs. diclofenac or AMG in elderly patients <LINK REF="STD-Niccoli-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Niccoli 2002</LINK>. The <LINK REF="STD-CRESCENT-_x0028_Sowers_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">CRESCENT (Sowers)</LINK> study examined 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure in treated hypertensive patients with OA and type II diabetes. Results are only available in abstract form; "at week 6, rofecoxib induced a significant increase in 24-hour systolic blood pressure (+4.2 mm Hg), whereas celecoxib and naproxen did not (-0.1 mmHg and -0.8mmHg p=0.005). Week 12 results were comparable to week 6". No further data were presented. The two SUCCESS trials were also conducted in older hypertensive OA patients; clinically significant systolic blood pressure increase (more than 20mmHg) occurred in 83/960 of patients taking celecoxib and 147/942 patients taking rofecoxib (RR 1.81 CI: 1.40, 2.33); this difference was statistically significant <LINK REF="STD-SUCCESS-VI" TYPE="STUDY">SUCCESS VI</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-SUCCESS-VII" TYPE="STUDY">SUCCESS VII</LINK>. Increased rates of oedema also occurred and it was more common in women. There was no statistically significant difference in the numbers of patients experiencing diastolic BP change. Sub-group analysis indicated these changes occurred in patients taking angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and beta-blocker therapy (with or without diuretics), but not those taking calcium channel antagonists or diuretic monotherapy. The difference between rofecoxib and celecoxib in the numbers of patients experiencing clinically significant systolic blood pressure and oedema was not evident in studies conducted in standard populations (<LINK REF="STD-Gibofsky-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Gibofsky 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-VACT" TYPE="STUDY">VACT</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schnitzer-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Schnitzer 2001</LINK>). There is some question of the treatment of dropouts in the independent study <LINK REF="STD-Niccoli-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Niccoli 2002</LINK>, but again indicated that after 2 weeks treatment, compared to diclofenac rofecoxib 25mg daily caused an increase in systolic blood pressure (mean 10mm Hg (SD 11.81) vs 2mmHg (SD 7.45) (WMD 8.00 CI 3.00, 13.00) and diastolic blood pressure mean 9.00 mmHg (SD 7.66 vs 2.00 mmHg (SD6.23) (WMD 8.00 CI: 4.47, 11.53). More patients also experienced oedema (10/34 vs 0/31 (RR 19.20 CI: 1.17, 314.55), hypertension 8/34 vs 0/31(RR 15.54 CI: 0.93, 258. 58) and weight gain 10/34 vs 0/31(RR 19.20 CI: 1.17, 314.55). In the other RCTs that reported cardiorenal adverse events, whilst in some cases there was a trend towards more cardio-renal adverse events, there were no significant differences between rofecoxib and an active comparator in any of the individual studies or pooled analyses. This held true for both the smaller studies and those that included up to 5000 patients.</P>
<P>A key question mark remains over the risk-benefit ratio of the coxibs. Whilst this review provides important information on the relative risks of adverse events, it must be acknowledged that RCTs are not sufficient on their own to provide information on the risk of rare adverse events. The likelihood of detecting an adverse drug reaction (ADR) is dependent on its severity, frequency and occurrence relative to exposure. Although the RCT is the gold-standard of clinical trial designs, the numbers of patients used and the short duration mean that they will only identify the most common and acutely occurring ADRs within the specified subgroup of included patients. Many RCTs will not powered sufficiently to detect differences in rare events such PUBs, POBs and myocardial infarctions. Moreover, trial protocols exclude patients from 'at risk' groups which are not generalisable to the population who will inevitably be exposed to the drug (i.e. people with co-morbidities). Although an exhaustive investigation of all adverse event data is outside the remit of this Cochrane review, a number of additional sources could be used to collate information on ADRs. </P>
<P>A number of such studies of rofecoxib have been conducted and the results have been conflicting and difficult to interpret because drug exposure and confounding factors will vary over the length of a long-term observational study. The usefulness of the information derived from computerised databases is also highly dependent on the accuracy and completeness of data collection and entry, which needs to be rigorously controlled and monitored. The effect of 'channelling bias' must also be taken into account, whereby physicians are more likely to have prescribed Cox II selective drugs to higher risk patients, who are by definition at greater risk. Spontaneous reporting systems such as the Yellow Card system and the MedWatch system in the United States suffer from similar disadvantages in that the number of adverse events that are recorded are a function of the length of time that a drug has been on the market, the amount it is prescribed, the seriousness of the event and the attending publicity. Neither method can be used to calculate incidences or relative safety, as the size of exposed population is generally not known and must be estimated from prescription data.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>Rofecoxib was voluntarily withdrawn from global markets in October 2004 and therefore there are no implications for practice concerning its use.<BR/>None the less when considering which NSAID to use, it must be borne in mind that the toxicity of NSAIDs is variable amongst patients and drugs, and it tends to be dose related and associated with variation in the mode of action, absorption, distribution and metabolism.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>There remains a number of questions over both the benefits and risks associated with Cox II selective agents and further work is ongoing. It is likely that this issue will not be resolved until research has enabled a fuller understanding of the complex mechanism by which the Cox system operates.</P>

<REFERENCE NOTES="&lt;p&gt;Abstract&lt;br&gt;The treatment of osteoarthritis, a common degenerative joint disease, is focused on the relief of symptoms, mainly pain, and sometimes joint stiffness. Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs are considered the treatment of choice in cases where the pain cannot be reduced with acetaminophen. This trial was conducted to compare the effectiveness of 2 nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs taken once daily to relieve the symptoms of osteoarthritis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Objective: To compare the safety and efficacy of 2 nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, nimesulide versus rofecoxib, given once a day in patients with knee osteoarthritis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: 114 patients with the diagnosis of knee osteoarthritis were recruited in a randomized, double-blinded fashion, and they received a daily dose of either 300 mg of nimesulide retard or 25 mg of rofecoxib. The effectiveness was evaluated by means of: visual analog scale 0 to 10 cm measured at 0, 15, 30, and 45 minutes after the first dose and then after 2, 3, 15, and 30 days of continuous drug dosing. The quality of life was assessed by the scale of the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities on days 0, 15, and 30. The patients' opinions and that of the physicians were recorded at the end of the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: The 2 groups of patients were matched for race, sex, menopause status (for females), pathologic antecedents, the duration of osteoarthritis, and the history of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug therapy; however, patients' affected knees could differ in the 2 treatments. The 2 drugs were equally effective in terms of overall improvement of pain and the quality of life; they were equally well tolerated. However, significant differences were found between the 2 drugs in favor of nimesulide in the relief of the pain on days 2, 3, and 30, and in the scale of Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis index on day 15 and 30.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Discussion: In this trial, both medications were effective in improving the pain and the quality of life in patients with knee osteoarthritis; however, nimesulide, compared with rofecoxib, was quicker in reducing the pain and was more effective on days 2, 3, and 30. Nimesulide was also superior in improving the quality of life after 30 days of treatment.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" PRIMARY="YES" TYPE="JOURNAL_ARTICLE">

Also states that methodology identical to Kivtiz therefore methods copied from this entry in table of characteristics of included studies. There are however slight variations in the methodology described- Kivitz states corticosteroid use per se, whilst Geba abstract states "corticosteroid use within one month". Similarly Geba states " sustained use of antacids, H2 blockers or PPIs", whilst Kivitz states use per se.<BR/>

<P>WITHDRAWALS: 232/693 = 66.5%<BR/>Standard deviations of the efficacy variables not avaialble in the publication. Unclear what time period the endpoints reported are from (see methods) and no data available for the 'primary efficacy analyses [which] were based on the average change from baseline over the first 12 week treatment period. <BR/>Treatment period means given for response to therapy. Figure 4 states graphs for primary efficacy end points (WOMAC pain, physical function and stiffness), which conflict with those stated in the methods (see outcomes). Figure 4 also indicates that p&lt;0.001 vs placebo, atlhough no placebo arm stated in the methods. Rofecoxib 12.5 mg signficantly less effective than diclofenac for secondary outcomes: pain when walking on a flat surface; investigator global response to therpay and patient global assesment of disease status. and use of rescue paracetamol. 25mg rofecoxib and diclofenac no significant difference. Report however states that " The 95% CIs for the difference between 12.5mg and 25mg rofecoxib versus diclofenac were contained within the prespecified comparability grounds for all of hte global assessments indicating clinical comparability of responses among the three treatments." Paper also states that " Signficant differences resulted from sample sizes, which needed to be large to ensure satisfaction of the comparability criteria."<BR/>Table2 and Table 3 are conflicting in terms of numbers of patients withdrawing due to lack of efficacy.<BR/>Although it states ITT analysis also states that " fewer than 1% of patients were missing sufficient data (either the baseline or all treatment period values) to exclude them from the efficacy analysis.</P>
