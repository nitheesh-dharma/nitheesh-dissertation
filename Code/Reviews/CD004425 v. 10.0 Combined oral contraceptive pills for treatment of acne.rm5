<TITLE>Effect of birth control pills on acne in women</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2012-02-01 13:56:00 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="Laureen M Lopez">
<P>Acne is a common skin problem for women. Several treatments are available. Combined birth control pills, which have the hormones estrogen and progestin, are often prescribed for women with acne. This review looked at how well birth control pills worked to treat facial acne.</P>
<P>In January 2012, we did a computer search for studies of birth control pills and acne treatment. Outcomes could be the amount of acne, how severe the acne was, and how many women dropped out early due to problems. We wrote to researchers to find other trials. We included randomized trials in any language that compared two types of birth control pills, a pill and a placebo or 'dummy,' or a pill and another acne treatment.</P>
<P>The review now includes 31 trials with a total of 12,579 women. Ten studies used dummies. Overall, 24 pairs of treatments or placebos were compared: 6 compared a birth control pill and a placebo, 17 compared different types of birth control pills, and 1 compared a pill and an antibiotic. The six pills studied in trials with placebos worked well to reduce facial acne. When we compared pills with different hormones, we did not see any important and consistent differences.</P>
<P>The conclusions did not change when we added trials in this update. Most trials compared two types of pills for acne treatment. Better quality studies are needed to compare one birth control pill with another. Studies should use standard methods for reporting how severe the acne is. How birth control pills compare to other acne treatments like antibiotics is not clear. Since birth control pills improve acne, they can be used to treat women with acne who also want birth control.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Acne is a common skin disorder among women. Although no uniform approach to the management of acne exists, combination oral contraceptives (COCs), which contain an estrogen and a progestin, often are prescribed for women. </P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To determine the effectiveness of combined oral contraceptives (COCs) for the treatment of facial acne compared to placebo or other active therapies.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2012-01-31 10:21:22 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="Laureen M Lopez">
<P>In January 2012, we searched for randomized controlled trials of COCs and acne in the computerized databases of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, POPLINE, and LILACS. We also searched for clinical trials in ClinicalTrials.gov and the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (Aug 2011). For the initial review, we wrote to researchers to seek any unpublished or published trials that we might have missed.</P>

<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2012-02-21 14:29:52 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We considered randomized controlled trials reported in any language that compared the effectiveness of a COC containing an estrogen and a progestin to placebo or another active therapy for acne in women.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2012-02-21 14:10:42 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="Laureen M Lopez">
<P>We extracted data on facial lesion counts, both total and specific (i.e., open or closed comedones, papules, pustules and nodules); acne severity grades; global assessments by the clinician or the participant, and discontinuation due to adverse events. Data were entered and analyzed in RevMan. For continuous data, we calculated the mean difference (MD) and 95% confidence interval (CI). For dichotomous data, we calculated the Peto odds ratio (OR) and 95% CI.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-02-21 15:04:53 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="Laureen M Lopez">
<P>The review includes 31 trials with 12,579 participants. Of 24 comparisons made, 6 compared a COC to placebo, 17 different COCs, and 1 compared a COC to an antibiotic. Of nine placebo-controlled trials with data for analysis, all showed COCs reduced acne lesion counts, severity grades and self-assessed acne compared to placebo. A levonorgestrel-COC group had fewer total lesion counts (MD -9.98; 95% CI -16.51 to -3.45), inflammatory and non-inflammatory lesion counts, and were more likely to have a clinician assessment of clear or almost clear lesions and participant self-assessment of improved acne lesions. A norethindrone acetate COC had better results for clinician global assessment of no acne to mild acne (OR 1.86; 95% CI 1.32 to 2.62). In two combined trials, a norgestimate COC showed reduced total lesion counts (MD-9.32; 95% CI -14.19 to -4.45), reduced inflammatory lesion and comedones counts, and more with clinician assessment of improved acne. For two combined trials of a drospirenone COC, the investigators' assessment of clear or almost clear skin favored the drospirenone group (OR 3.02; 95% CI 1.99 to 4.59). In one trial, the drospirenone-COC group showed greater (more positive) percent changes for total lesion count (MD 29.08; 95% CI 3.13 to 55.03), inflammatory and non-inflammatory lesion counts, and papule and closed comedone counts. A dienogest-COC group had greater percentage decreases in total lesion count (MD -15.30; 95% CI -19.98 to -10.62) and inflammatory lesion count, and more women assessed with overall improvement of facial acne. A CMA-COC group had more 'responders,' those with 50% or greater decrease in facial papules and pustules (OR 2.31; 95% CI 1.50 to 3.55)</P>
<P>Differences in the comparative effectiveness of COCs containing varying progestin types and dosages were less clear, and data were limited for any particular comparison. COCs that contained chlormadinone acetate or cyproterone acetate improved acne better than levonorgestrel. A COC with cyproterone acetate showed better acne outcomes than one with desogestrel, but the studies produced conflicting results. Likewise, levonorgestrel showed a slight improvement over desogestrel in acne outcomes, but results were not consistent. A drospirenone COC appeared to be more effective than norgestimate or nomegestrol acetate plus 17&#946;-estradiol but less effective than cyproterone acetate.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2012-02-21 14:17:05 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="Laureen M Lopez">
<P>This update yielded six new trials but no change in conclusions. The six COCs evaluated in placebo-controlled trials are effective in reducing inflammatory and non-inflammatory facial acne lesions. Few important and consistent differences were found between COC types in their effectiveness for treating acne. How COCs compare to alternative acne treatments is unknown since only one trial addressed this issue. The use of standardized methods for assessing acne severity would help in synthesizing results across trials as well as aid in interpretation.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2012-02-01 13:54:56 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="Laureen M Lopez">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2012-02-01 13:54:56 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="Laureen M Lopez">
<P>Acne vulgaris is a skin disorder of the sebaceous follicles that presents as lesions that are either inflamed (i.e., papules, pustules and nodules) or non-inflamed (i.e., open or closed comedones, papules, pustules and nodules) (<LINK REF="REF-Toyoda-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Toyoda 2001</LINK>). It is one of the most common skin conditions requiring medical treatment, yet its pathophysiology is poorly understood. The characteristic localization of acne to the face and upper trunk is a result of the distribution of oil-secreting structures known as sebaceous glands within the hair follicles. Although the etiology of acne involves a number of interrelated factors (<LINK REF="REF-George-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">George 2008</LINK>), a large amount of evidence indicates that one factor may be an increased rate of sebum production, which is predominantly controlled by androgenic sex hormones.</P>
<P>Acne is a common condition. For example, the prevalence of clinical acne among Danish adolescent women aged 15 to 22 years was 24% (<LINK REF="REF-Jemec-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jemec 2002</LINK>). In a French study of women aged 25 to 40 years, 41% of the respondents reported currently having acne (<LINK REF="REF-Poli-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Poli 2001</LINK>). A clinical UK study of women aged 25 years or older found that 54% of the participants had facial acne and 12% had clinical facial acne (<LINK REF="REF-Goulden-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goulden 1999</LINK>). Acne affects an estimated 40 to 50 million people in the US annually (<LINK REF="REF-George-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">George 2008</LINK>). More than 25% of acne sufferers in the US consult a physician annually (<LINK REF="REF-Bergfeld-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bergfeld 1995</LINK>). In addition to the morbidity associated with lesions and adverse effects of treatments, acne can produce life-long physical and emotional scars (<LINK REF="REF-Baldwin-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baldwin 2002</LINK>). The cost of acne treatment constitutes an economic burden to both the individual and community.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2011-10-26 13:22:37 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="Laureen M Lopez">
<P>No consensus exists as to the most appropriate approach to the management of acne. Individual acne lesions can remit spontaneously by unknown mechanisms that may be associated with de-differentiation of follicular cells that produce sebum or by spontaneous resolution of inflammatory changes in the lesions (<LINK REF="REF-Downie-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Downie 2002</LINK>). Although effective prescribed medications are available, many women rely on over-the-counter preparations and herbal remedies, in conjunction with strict skin hygiene routines and dietary modifications (<LINK REF="REF-Webster-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Webster 2002</LINK>). Treatment options generally target one or more of the factors implicated in acne pathogenesis (i.e., blockage of hair follicle openings, bacteria colonization, abnormal keratinization or excess sebum production). Medications that affect one or more of these mechanisms either alone or in combination are commonly used (<LINK REF="REF-Eady-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eady 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Leyden-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leyden 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Burkhart-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burkhart 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Thiboutot-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thiboutot 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Webster-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Webster 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>A number of COCs, containing different progestins and hormonal dosages, are prescribed for women with acne, often for their dual functions of acne treatment and contraception. COCs traditionally used for acne treatment contain cyproterone acetate (CPA) and ethinyl estradiol (EE). In the UK, for example, the COC containing CPA 2 mg and EE 35 &#956;g is licensed for treatment of women with severe acne that is refractory to prolonged treatment with antibiotics (<LINK REF="REF-Seaman-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Seaman 2003</LINK>). In the US, three COCs have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for treating moderate acne (<LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Connell-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Connell 2008</LINK>). The progestins in these COCs are norethindrone, norgestimate, and drospirenone.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2011-10-24 11:52:09 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="Laureen M Lopez">
<P>Combined oral contraceptives (COCs) are thought to alter the prognosis of acne through several mechanisms. First, COCs appear to decrease free testosterone levels by 40% to 50%, on average (<LINK REF="REF-Fotherby-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fotherby 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Thorneycroft-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Thorneycroft 1999</LINK>). This is due to a reduced production of the androgen, testosterone, achieved by the suppression of luteinizing hormone, which causes decreased androgen synthesis. Androgen bioavailability also is reduced when COCs increase the level of the protein that binds free androgens (sex hormone-binding globulin), which in turn, increases binding of testosterone. Secondly, testosterone has to be converted in the hair follicles and skin to dihydrotestosterone by the enzyme 5-alpha reductase to lead to acne (<LINK REF="REF-Cassidenti-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cassidenti 1991</LINK>). COCs prevent this conversion of free testosterone to dihydrotestosterone by blocking androgen receptors and inhibiting 5-alpha-reductase activity. Progestin types appear to differ in the degree to which they prevent testosterone production, bioavailability, or conversion (<LINK REF="REF-Rabe-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rabe 2000</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2011-08-24 14:58:39 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">

<P>Data were entered and analyzed with RevMan. For trials that included two or more intervention groups, we made all possible comparisons between groups. We calculated the number of events for any outcomes that were published as percentages if the absolute numbers for the numerators or denominators were provided. For continuous data, we extracted means and standard deviation or standard error and calculated the mean difference and 95% confidence interval (CI). For dichotomous data, we calculated the Peto odds ratio (OR) and 95% CI. We combined results of different trials in meta-analysis to calculate a weighted treatment effect across trials if they had similar types of interventions (i.e., same progestin type and dose, estrogen dose, and number of treatment cycles) and outcome measures.</P>

<P>For <LINK REF="STD-Mansour-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Mansour 2011</LINK>, the experimental treatment was nomegestrol acetate (NOMAC) 2.5 mg / E<SUB>2</SUB> 1.5 mg and the comparison was DRSP 3 mg / EE 30 &#956;g. After cycle 13, changes in acne severity favored the DRSP-COC group. For all participants, the investigators were less likely to report improved acne for the NOMAC group than for the DRSP group (OR 0.74; 95% CI 0.57 to 0.96), and more likely to record acne worsening for the NOMAC group (OR 2.14; 95% CI 1.49 to 3.05). For the women with acne at baseline, those in the NOMAC group were less likely to be rated as improved compared to the DRSP group (OR 0.60; 95% CI 0.42 to 0.84), and more likely to be classed as worsening (OR 2.69; 95% CI 1.29 to 5.63). Of those without acne at baseline, women in the NOMAC group were more likely to have new acne after cycle 13 (OR 2.00; 95% CI 1.33 to 3.01). Discontinuation due to adverse events was more likely in the NOMAC group (OR 1.77; 95% CI 1.36 to 2.30) as was discontinuation due to acne (OR 3.56; 95% CI 1.91 to 6.63).</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-02-06 12:22:08 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="Laureen M Lopez">
<P>COC use reduced inflammatory and non-inflammatory facial lesion counts, severity grades and self-assessed acne in the nine trials that compared a COC to a placebo group and had data for analysis. Progestins examined included levonorgestrel, norethindrone acetate, norgestimate, drospirenone, dienogest, and chlormadinone acetate.</P>
<P>Differences were less clear in the comparative effectiveness of COCs containing varying progestin types and dosages. Although COCs containing CPA have been traditionally used for acne treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Seaman-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Seaman 2003</LINK>), little evidence shows its superiority over other progestins. The CPA/EE combination appeared to improve acne (i.e., inflammatory lesions and global assessments) better than LNG/EE in the two trials that made this comparison (<LINK REF="STD-Lachnit_x002d_Fixson-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Lachnit-Fixson 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Carlborg-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Carlborg 1986</LINK>), but the findings had wide confidence intervals, which indicate limited precision. Also, the three trials that compared CPA/EE to DSG/EE produced conflicting results (<LINK REF="STD-Dieben-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Dieben 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Charoenvisal-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Charoenvisal 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vartiainen-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Vartiainen 2001</LINK>). The COCs with CPA/EE were not significantly different from LNG/EE or DSG/EE in discontinuation rates due to adverse events.</P>
<P>Few other differences between COCs regarding acne efficacy were found. DRSP/EE was more effective compared to NGM/EE (<LINK REF="STD-Thorneycroft-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Thorneycroft 2004</LINK>) and to NOMAC/E<SUB>2</SUB> (<LINK REF="STD-Mansour-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Mansour 2011</LINK>), but not more effective than CPA/EE (<LINK REF="STD-Van-Vloten-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Van Vloten 2002</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Van-Vloten-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Van Vloten 2002</LINK> was a much smaller study than <LINK REF="STD-Thorneycroft-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Thorneycroft 2004</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Mansour-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Mansour 2011</LINK>, which had greater power for detecting an important effect. However, <LINK REF="STD-Mansour-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Mansour 2011</LINK> did not involve lesion counts but relied on the investigator's assessment of acne severity. The COC with CMA seemed to improve acne better than LNG, but this is based on one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Worret-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Worret 2001</LINK>). Finally, LNG/EE showed a slight improvement over DSG/EE in <LINK REF="STD-Palatsi-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Palatsi 1984</LINK>, while <LINK REF="STD-Rosen-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Rosen 2003</LINK> found the two COC groups were not significantly different. <LINK REF="STD-Winkler-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Winkler 2004</LINK> had more favorable results with DSG/EE than with LNG/EE, but <LINK REF="STD-Winkler-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Winkler 2004</LINK> used a lower EE dose than the other two trials and had a larger sample size. Additional potential differences in acne effectiveness among COC types might not have been detected due to the limited number of eligible trials, comparisons made and data reported.</P>
<P>No conclusions can be reached regarding the effect of a COC compared to an antibiotic since only one underpowered trial made this comparison (<LINK REF="STD-Monk-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Monk 1987</LINK>).</P>

<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2012-01-31 11:48:38 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="Laureen M Lopez">
<P>Most studies assessed women over six treatment cycles, a length of time that might not be adequate for a chronic condition like acne. One trial that compared NOMAC/E<SUB>2</SUB> versus DRSP/EE showed a difference in early discontinuation due to total adverse events as well as those due to acne (<LINK REF="STD-Mansour-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Mansour 2011</LINK>). In addition, <LINK REF="STD-Kelly-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Kelly 2010</LINK> indicated the DRSP/EE group was less likely than the LNG/EE group to discontinue due to acne deterioration. Two placebo-controlled trials (<LINK REF="STD-Maloney-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Maloney 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Plewig-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Plewig 2009</LINK>) showed that the COC group was more likely to discontinue due to adverse events than the placebo group. The COCs were CMA/EE in <LINK REF="STD-Plewig-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Plewig 2009</LINK> and NA/EE in <LINK REF="STD-Maloney-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Maloney 2001</LINK>. Thus, even if COCs improve acne, women might not be willing to accept their long-term use as acne treatment due to other side effects. Other acne treatments could also have side effects that limit their acceptability. However, we found only one eligible trial with limited data that compared a COC to an antibiotic (<LINK REF="STD-Monk-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Monk 1987</LINK>).</P>

<P>Twenty trials reported some blinding of which 19 described double-blinding. The group assignment was apparent to both participants and investigators in 10 trials. Furthermore, only 11 studies described their methods of randomization, and only 5 trials provided information on their attempts to conceal allocation. The potential for bias is increased with an open study design as well as inadequate method of allocation concealment before group assignment (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-2002a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 2002a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schulz-2002b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 2002b</LINK>). In addition, most eligible trials were funded by pharmaceutical companies, which could present potential conflicts of interest in terms of the reporting of unfavorable results (<LINK REF="REF-Lexchin-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lexchin 2003</LINK>). Another limitation present in several studies was the high attrition rate due to exclusions after randomization, loss to follow up, early discontinuation, missing data or unexplained reasons. For example, nine trials reported acne outcomes that were measured using less than 70% of the randomized women (<LINK REF="STD-Palatsi-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Palatsi 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dieben-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Dieben 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lucky-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Lucky 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Redmond-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Redmond 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Thiboutot-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Thiboutot 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Winkler-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Winkler 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Worret-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Worret 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rosen-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Rosen 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kelly-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Kelly 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>Differences in treatment regimens, assessment methods and outcome measures in the studies make synthesis of the evidence difficult. In particular, the lack of use of standardized methods for assessing acne prevents the synthesis of results across trials and complicates their interpretation.</P>

<P>Several studies had insufficient for analysis in this review due to presenting outcome data in figures without absolute numbers or simply describing selected results in the text (<LINK REF="STD-Koltun-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Koltun 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Maloney-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Maloney 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kelly-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Kelly 2010</LINK>). The researchers apparently measured outcomes relevant to our review but did not report those results adequately. Such reporting is inconsistent with CONSORT guidelines and prevented our ability to include those results in the review (<LINK REF="REF-CONSORT-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">CONSORT 2009</LINK>).

<P>The development of acne is complex, and may be influenced by hormonal contraceptives (<LINK REF="REF-George-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">George 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rich-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rich 2008</LINK>). The level of free testosterone affects sebum production (<LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Connell-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Connell 2008</LINK>).  Ethinyl estradiol can increase sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), which lowers free testosterone (<LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Connell-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Connell 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rich-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rich 2008</LINK>). Some of the included trials examined the mechanisms via the levels of SHBG and testosterone. This review focused on the outcome of acne as assessed by lesion counts. Only three trials compared the same progestin (CPA) with EE doses of 35 µg versus 50 µg. Most of the trials that compared COCs examined different progestins as well as EE doses. The varied results suggest the differences may be related to the type of progestin as well as the estrogen dose. In addition, the estrogen dose may have to be higher than that found in most current COCs (<LINK REF="REF-Rich-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rich 2008</LINK>). </P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2012-02-21 14:45:06 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="Laureen M Lopez">
<P>This update yielded six new studies but no change in conclusions. Since COCs reduce acne lesion count, severity grades and self-assessed acne in placebo-controlled trials, they should be considered for women with acne who also want an oral contraceptive. COCs containing CMA or CPA seem to improve acne better than LNG; however, this finding is based on limited evidence. A DRSP-COC may be more effective than NGM or NOMAC/E<SUB>2 </SUB>but the trials used different methods to assess acne severity assessments. Comparisons between other COCs were either conflicting or showed no significant difference in their ability to reduce acne. How COCs compare to alternative acne treatments is unknown since only one trial addressed this issue.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2012-01-31 12:00:46 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Future studies should use allocation concealment. More recent studies were reportedly double-blind but should be clear about who was blinded. The use of standardized methods for assessing acne would help in synthesizing results across trials and aid in interpretation. The comparative effectiveness of COCs in treating acne should be evaluated in randomized controlled trials. In addition, research is needed on the acceptability of, and need for, long-term use of COCs for acne treatment.</P>
