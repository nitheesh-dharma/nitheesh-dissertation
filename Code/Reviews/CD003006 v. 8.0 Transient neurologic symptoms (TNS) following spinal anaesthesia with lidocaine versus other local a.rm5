<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2008-12-08 10:38:00 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>Lidocaine is the drug of choice for inducing spinal anaesthesia in ambulatory surgery because of its rapid onset of action, intense nerve blockade, and short duration of action. The possible side effects of spinal anaesthesia in adults, which develop after recovery, are backache, post-dural puncture headache, and transient neurologic symptoms that are characterized by slight to severe pain in the buttocks and legs. TNS symptoms develop within a few hours and up to 24 hours after anaesthesia. They last, in most cases, up to two days. The present review shows that lidocaine is more likely to cause transient neurologic symptoms than bupivacaine, prilocaine, and procaine. However, these drugs produce prolonged local anaesthetic effects and therefore are not desirable for ambulatory patients. It is possible that the reintroduction of 2-chloroprocaine will solve this lack of a suitable intrathecal local anaesthetic; confirmatory studies are needed.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-12-05 05:11:29 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Spinal anaesthesia has been in use since 1898. During the last decade there has been an increase in the number of reports implicating lidocaine as a possible cause of temporary and permanent neurologic complications after spinal anaesthesia. Follow up of patients who received uncomplicated spinal anaesthesia revealed that some of them developed pain in the lower extremities after an initial full recovery. This painful condition that occurs in the immediate postoperative period was named 'transient neurologic symptoms' (TNS).</P>

<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2008-12-05 05:12:27 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>To study the frequency of TNS and neurologic complications after spinal anaesthesia with lidocaine compared to other local anaesthetics.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2008-12-05 05:26:50 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Sixteen trials reporting on 1467 patients, 125 of whom developed TNS, were included in the analysis. The use of lidocaine for spinal anaesthesia increased the risk of developing TNS. There was no evidence that this painful condition was associated with any neurologic pathology; the symptoms disappeared spontaneously by the fifth postoperative day. The relative risk (RR) for developing TNS after spinal anaesthesia with lidocaine as compared to other local anaesthetics (bupivacaine, prilocaine, procaine, levobupivacaine, ropivacaine, and 2-chloroprocaine) was 7.31 (95% confidence interval (CI) 4.16 to 12.86). Mepivacaine was found to give similar results as lidocaine and was therefor omitted from the overall comparison to diminish the heterogeneity.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2008-12-05 05:27:59 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The risk of developing TNS after spinal anaesthesia with lidocaine was significantly higher than when bupivacaine, prilocaine, or procaine were used. The term 'transient neurological symptoms' implies neurologic pathology. Failing identification of the pathogenesis of TNS, consideration should be given to choosing a neutral descriptive term which does not imply a particular causation. One study about the impact of TNS on patient satisfaction and functional impairment demonstrated that non-TNS patients were more satisfied and had less functional impairment after surgery than TNS patients, but this did not influence their willingness to recommend spinal anaesthesia.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-12-08 10:38:24 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>August Bier performed the first spinal anaesthesia in 1898 using cocaine, which was the first known local anaesthetic (<LINK REF="REF-Bier-1899" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bier 1899</LINK>). Cocaine was soon replaced by another less toxic local anaesthetic, amylocaine. Other local anaesthetics were gradually introduced: procaine, 2-chloroprocaine, dibucaine, lidocaine, tetracaine, mepivacaine, prilocaine, bupivacaine, and finally ropivacaine and levobupivacaine. Lidocaine, procaine, tetracaine, mepivacaine, dibucaine, and bupivacaine are still used for spinal anaesthesia (<LINK REF="REF-Axelrod-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Axelrod 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hiller-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hiller 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Holmdahl-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Holmdahl 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Iselin_x002d_Chaves-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Iselin-Chaves 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Masuda-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Masuda 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tagariello-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tagariello 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>The main clinical differences among these local anaesthetics are: the degree of central nervous system and cardio-vascular toxicity; the speed of onset; the intensity of motor and sensory blockade; and the duration of the surgical anaesthesia and regression phases. The choice of local anaesthetic is determined by the type and duration of surgery and by the intensity of motor blockade that is required. Regional geographical preferences dependent upon national differences in pharmaceutical industry supply can also play an important role.</P>
<P>The increase in day case surgery has generated a need for a local anaesthetic with a quick onset and short duration of action that allows for a speedy recovery and early discharge. So far, this profile is fulfilled only by lidocaine (<LINK REF="REF-Liu-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liu 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>Intrathecally (spinally)<B> </B>administered local anaesthetics cause reversible blockade of nerve impulse conduction in the affected nerve roots. Experiments on animals have shown that all tested local anaesthetics have potential neurotoxic effects that are dependent on the dosage used and the duration of exposure (<LINK REF="REF-Li-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Li 1985</LINK>). All local anaesthetics can cause permanent nerve damage when administered in a high concentration or when applied over a long period of time.</P>
<P>Retrospective and prospective surveys of neurological complications after spinal anaesthesia, and databases dealing with postoperative outcomes, have however shown that serious and permanent neurologic complications after spinal anaesthesia are rare events (<LINK REF="REF-Corbey-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Corbey 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Dahlgren-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dahlgren 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Freedman-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Freedman 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Noble-1971" TYPE="REFERENCE">Noble 1971</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Phillips-1969" TYPE="REFERENCE">Phillips 1969</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Renck-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Renck 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tarkkila-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tarkkila 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vandam-1955" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vandam 1955</LINK>). Reported cases of such permanent neurological deficits involve all known local anaesthetics (<LINK REF="REF-Auroy-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Auroy 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Green-1961" TYPE="REFERENCE">Green 1961</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kane-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kane 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sumi-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sumi 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vandam-1960" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vandam 1960</LINK>). The drug 2-chloroprocaine is an example of a local anaesthetic; it has been used for spinal anaesthesia since 1952 (<LINK REF="REF-Foldes-1952" TYPE="REFERENCE">Foldes 1952</LINK>), especially for obstetric epidural anaesthesia because of its rapid onset of action, quick metabolism, and low toxicity (<LINK REF="REF-Winnie-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Winnie 2001</LINK>). In the early 1980s reports about permanent neurologic deficits in eight patients that inadvertently received high doses of 2-chloroprocaine intrathecally were published (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Reisner-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reisner 1980</LINK>). Although these sequelae were probably due to the combination of low pH and the presence of the antioxidant bisulphite, the use of 2-chloroprocaine was then abandoned.</P>
<P>From the beginning of 1990, a number of cases were published reporting cauda equina syndrome that was related to the introduction of a microcatheter technique for continuous spinal anaesthesia with hyperbaric 5% lidocaine (the drug of choice) (<LINK REF="REF-Rigler-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rigler 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schell-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schell 1991</LINK>). In 1993, a new adverse effect, 'transient neurologic toxicity', was described in patients recovering from single injection spinal anaesthesia with lidocaine (<LINK REF="REF-Schneider-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schneider 1993</LINK>). In the following years new names for this condition appeared in the literature: 'transient radicular irritation' (TRI) (<LINK REF="STD-Hampl-1995b" TYPE="STUDY">Hampl 1995b</LINK>) and 'transient neurologic symptoms' (TNS) (<LINK REF="STD-Hampl-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Hampl 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>The symptoms of TNS can appear in a few hours or within up to 24 hours; that is, well after a full recovery has been made from an uneventful spinal anaesthesia. These symptoms consist of pain originating in the gluteal region and radiating to both lower extremities (<LINK REF="REF-Gerancher-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gerancher 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tarkkila-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tarkkila 1995</LINK>). The intensity of pain varies from light to severe. Neurologic examination, magnetic resonance imaging, and electropathological testing have shown no abnormalities in patients with TNS (<LINK REF="REF-Pollock-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pollock 2000</LINK>). In spite of this, TNS has been interpreted as a sign of possible neurotoxicity of lidocaine (<LINK REF="REF-Douglas-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Douglas 1995</LINK>). These symptoms are not unique to lidocaine and are known to occur with other local anaesthetics as well (<LINK REF="REF-Casati-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Casati 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hiller-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hiller 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lynch-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lynch 1997</LINK>). The continued use of lidocaine as a spinal anaesthetic has been questioned: is it more neurotoxic than other local anaesthetics; should its use be curtailed (<LINK REF="REF-Drasner-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Drasner 1997</LINK>)? The main reason for the continuing use of lidocaine for spinal anaesthesia is its short duration of action, intense blockade, quick recovery, and suitability for day case surgery (<LINK REF="REF-Gielen-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gielen 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McKeown-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">McKeown 1986</LINK>). Now 2-chloroprocaine has been reintroduced in an antioxidant- and preservative-free formulation (<LINK REF="STD-Casati-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Casati 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kopacz-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kopacz 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Smith-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smith 2004</LINK>). So far the studies have shown that 2-chloroprocaine compares favourably with lidocaine as the local anaesthetic of choice for ambulatory spinal anaesthesia (<LINK REF="REF-Yoos-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yoos 2005</LINK>) and no cases of TNS have been reported (Sell 2008).</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2008-12-05 05:48:16 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The objective of this review was to compare the frequency of transient neurologic symptoms (TNS) and neurologic complications after spinal anaesthesia with lidocaine with the frequency of these adverse effects after other local anaesthetics, in adult surgical patients. We defined neurologic complications as any sensory and motor deficits lasting for longer than 48 hours after onset of spinal anaesthesia. The reason for this choice of interval is that the longest reported duration of spinal anaesthesia with bupivacaine was 48 hours.</P>

<P>We included all adult patients who received spinal anaesthesia. Pregnant patients were considered as a subgroup. The follow-up period for TNS was at least 24 hours. We chose this time interval because the symptoms of TNS appear within 24 hours after spinal anaesthesia (<LINK REF="STD-Aouad-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Aouad 2001</LINK>). All patients who developed TNS were to be followed until complete recovery. In case of sensory and motor deficits after spinal anaesthesia, the follow-up period should be longer than 48 hours.</P>

<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>The included studies had to have at least one arm in which lidocaine (irrespective of the concentration and baricity of the solution) was used for spinal anaesthesia in preparation for surgery. The second arm consisted of any other local anaesthetic. We excluded studies dealing with meperidine as a sole intrathecal agent, or combinations of local anaesthetics and opioids. We also excluded studies in which spinal anaesthesia was combined with epidural analgesia.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Data extraction</HEADING>
<P>We recorded the following information from the included studies in the table 'Characteristics of included studies': experimental design characteristics; number of patients; demographics; country of investigation; treatment groups; concentration and volume of the local anaesthetic used; duration of the follow-up period; spinal needle size and shape.

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Assessment of methodological quality</HEADING>
<P>We assessed each study considered for inclusion for quality based on the use of randomisation for allocation to treatment groups; the blinding of patients, providers, and assessors; concealment of random allocation; and the description of the withdrawals. We considered allocation concealment as adequate ('A') if sealed envelopes were used; as uncertain ('B') if identical blinded vials were used without mention of sealed envelopes; and not adequate ('C') if neither were mentioned in the study.

We used a Chi<SUP>2</SUP> test to examine the included RCTs for statistical evidence of heterogeneity; the degree of heterogeneity was assessed with the I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic. We applied the random-effects model in case of significant heterogeneity (P &lt; 0.10). We planned subgroup analyses for patients placed in a special position (that is lithotomy) and for the use of different intrathecal needles (sharp versus pencil point, different sizes) because these factors are supposed to influence the frequency of TNS. We investigated the possibility of publication bias using a funnel plot.</P>

<P>We considered 64 studies dealing with neurologic complications and spinal anaesthesia with lidocaine. Of these, we determined that 27 did not address issues relevant to this review and 21 studies were excluded for the reasons cited in the 'Characteristics of excluded studies' table. We included 16 RCTs in the final analysis. One of these was a newly identified RCT (<LINK REF="STD-Casati-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Casati 2007</LINK>). All 16 included studies satisfied the inclusion criterion of comparing lidocaine as one treatment arm with different local anaesthetics in the second treatment arm. The local anaesthetic in this second arm consisted of bupivacaine in seven studies (<LINK REF="STD-Aouad-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Aouad 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hampl-1995b" TYPE="STUDY">Hampl 1995b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hampl-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Hampl 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Keld-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Keld 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Philip-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Philip 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pollock-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Pollock 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Salmela-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Salmela 1998</LINK>); prilocaine in four studies (<LINK REF="STD-de-Weert-2000" TYPE="STUDY">de Weert 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hampl-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Hampl 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Martinez_x002d_Bourio-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Martinez-Bourio 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Salmela-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Salmela 1998</LINK>); mepivacaine in three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Liguori-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Liguori 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Salazar-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Salazar 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Salmela-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Salmela 1998</LINK>); procaine in two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Hodgson-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Hodgson 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Le-Truong-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Le Truong 2001</LINK>); ropivacaine and levobupivacaine in one study (<LINK REF="STD-Breebaart-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Breebaart 2003</LINK>); and 2-chloroprocaine in one study (<LINK REF="STD-Casati-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Casati 2007</LINK>). There were four studies (<LINK REF="STD-Breebaart-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Breebaart 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hampl-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Hampl 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pollock-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Pollock 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Salmela-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Salmela 1998</LINK>) with more than two treatment arms. In <LINK REF="STD-Hampl-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Hampl 1998</LINK> two concentrations of lidocaine were used and the results of the two lidocaine groups were pooled. In three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Breebaart-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Breebaart 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pollock-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Pollock 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Salmela-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Salmela 1998</LINK>) there were three treatment groups: two alternative local anaesthetics plus lidocaine. To avoid including the lidocaine patients twice in the comparison tables, one-half of the lidocaine patients were compared to all the patients of each of the other local anaesthetics treatment groups. In one study (<LINK REF="STD-Hampl-1995b" TYPE="STUDY">Hampl 1995b</LINK>) a control group with patients receiving general anaesthesia was not taken into consideration for statistical analysis.</P>
<P>Four studies came from the USA, three from Scandinavia, two from Switzerland, two from Spain, and one each from Belgium, Canada, Italy, Lebanon, and the Netherlands. Two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Aouad-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Aouad 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Philip-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Philip 2001</LINK>) differed from the rest because the participants were pregnant women. All studies investigated the frequency of TNS; one reported no events in any of the studied arms (<LINK REF="STD-Aouad-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Aouad 2001</LINK>) and in seven studies no events were found in the 'other treatment' arm (<LINK REF="STD-Breebaart-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Breebaart 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Casati-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Casati 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-de-Weert-2000" TYPE="STUDY">de Weert 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hampl-1995b" TYPE="STUDY">Hampl 1995b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Le-Truong-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Le Truong 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Liguori-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Liguori 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pollock-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Pollock 1996</LINK>). Subgroups of patients exposed to lithotomy or the supine position and pencil point or sharp spinal needles were included in five RCTs (<LINK REF="STD-Le-Truong-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Le Truong 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Martinez_x002d_Bourio-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Martinez-Bourio 1998</LINK>; Østgaard 2000; <LINK REF="STD-Pollock-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Pollock 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Salmela-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Salmela 1998</LINK>). In the rest of the RCTs, the majority of patients underwent surgery in the supine position and only one kind of spinal needle (pencil point, 25 G or larger) was used.</P>
<P>All included studies investigated the risk of TNS and no study was set up to investigate sensory and motor deficits after spinal anaesthesia. The follow-up period was at least 24 hours and all patients with TNS were followed longer than 24 hours, until recovery. The interviewer who assessed the occurrence of TNS was blinded as to which treatment group the patient belonged to in all but one RCT (<LINK REF="STD-de-Weert-2000" TYPE="STUDY">de Weert 2000</LINK>) in which blinding was unclear). In seven of the studies the interview was done by telephone (<LINK REF="STD-Breebaart-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Breebaart 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Casati-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Casati 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hodgson-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Hodgson 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Keld-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Keld 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Liguori-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Liguori 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Martinez_x002d_Bourio-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Martinez-Bourio 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pollock-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Pollock 1996</LINK>) and in the remainder by direct contact with the patient, except for <LINK REF="STD-Le-Truong-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Le Truong 2001</LINK> (where it was unclear).</P>

<P>The overall quality of the included RCTs was good (see the table 'Characteristics of included studies'). All studies were randomized. The blinding procedure was complete (patient, provider, and assessor) in five studies (<LINK REF="STD-Casati-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Casati 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hampl-1995b" TYPE="STUDY">Hampl 1995b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hampl-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Hampl 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Philip-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Philip 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pollock-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Pollock 1996</LINK>) and blinding of patient and assessor was accomplished in eight studies (<LINK REF="STD-Aouad-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Aouad 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Breebaart-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Breebaart 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hodgson-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Hodgson 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Keld-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Keld 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Le-Truong-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Le Truong 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Liguori-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Liguori 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Martinez_x002d_Bourio-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Martinez-Bourio 1998</LINK>; Østgaard 2000).

<P>See 'Comparisons and data' for more information.</P>
<P>The sixteen studies had a patient enrolment of 1479; outcomes were available for 1467. The overall risk of developing TNS when lidocaine was used for spinal anaesthesia was significantly higher than with all other investigated local anaesthetics (P = 0.0001) with a relative risk of 4.62 (95 % CI 2.30 to 9.26) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>; <LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>). When the studies that compared mepivacaine with lidocaine (<LINK REF="STD-Liguori-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Liguori 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Salazar-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Salazar 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Salmela-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Salmela 1998</LINK>) were excluded from the analysis the heterogeneity Chi<SUP>2</SUP> statistic was not significant (P = 0.83); a fixed-effect model estimated the relative risk as 7.31 (95% CI 4.16 to 12.86) (<LINK REF="CMP-002.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.1</LINK>; <LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>). Pregnant women seemed to have a low frequency of TNS after spinal anaesthesia irrespective of the local anaesthetic used, but the number of participants was only 258 with three cases of TNS reported. Therefore, more studies were needed to elucidate whether pregnant women were less likely to develop TNS.</P>
<P>In the three studies that compared lidocaine with mepivacaine, the frequency of TNS was not higher for the lidocaine group; again the number of patients was not large. It was possible that spinal anaesthesia with mepivacaine was associated with a similar frequency of TNS as with lidocaine. Bupivacaine, prilocaine, and procaine, on the other hand, were associated with a lower frequency of TNS than lidocaine<I>. </I>Using the methods of Altman (<LINK REF="REF-Altman-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Altman 2003</LINK>), the relative risk of developing TNS after spinal anaesthesia with lidocaine compared to mepivacaine was different from the relative risk for bupivacaine versus lidocaine (z = 3.313, P = 0.002); different from prilocaine versus lidocaine (z = 2.71, P = 0.007); and different from procaine versus lidocaine (z = 2.59, P = 0.01).</P>
<P>In eight of the included RCTs (<LINK REF="STD-Aouad-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Aouad 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Breebaart-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Breebaart 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Casati-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Casati 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-de-Weert-2000" TYPE="STUDY">de Weert 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hampl-1995b" TYPE="STUDY">Hampl 1995b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Le-Truong-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Le Truong 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Liguori-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Liguori 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pollock-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Pollock 1996</LINK>) we found no events of TNS in the other treatment group; in <LINK REF="STD-Aouad-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Aouad 2001</LINK> there were no cases of TNS at all. The explanation for this lack of events may be that the patient populations differed from those in the other studies or that the number of patients was too small to encounter the event.</P>
<P>None of the 1467 patients who received spinal anaesthesia were reported to have any permanent neurologic sensory or motor deficits. A few cases of paraesthesiae related to the spinal injection were described, but without sequelae.</P>
<P>The total number of patients who developed TNS after receiving spinal anaesthesia with lidocaine was 102 of 719 patients (see table 'Patients with TNS') (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>). The clinical picture was typically bilateral pain in the buttocks, thighs, and legs. These started within 24 hours after initiation of spinal anaesthesia and after complete recovery from the spinal anaesthesia. Pain varied in intensity from mild to severe (VAS score 2 to 9.5) with most patients complaining of mild to moderate pain. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) were the treatment of choice; a few patients received opiates as well. In most patients the pain disappeared by the second day and the maximum duration was five days, aside from one patient having symptoms for 10 days. None of these patients had positive neurologic signs.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Subgroup analysis</HEADING>
<P>We did not perform subgroup analysis based on patient position (lithotomy versus supine) or the shape and size of the spinal needle as we could not derive systematic data from the 16 included RCTs. The majority of patients were operated on in the supine position (1021 out of 1437) and pencil-point needles (in most cases 25 G) were used in 1018 patients. A subgroup analysis was not possible due to this lack of variability.</P>

<P>A funnel plot of the included studies was reasonably symmetric but that did not exclude the possibility of missing studies (unpublished data).

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2008-12-05 07:05:58 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The main clinical question addressed by this review is whether lidocaine used for spinal anaesthesia causes symptoms of TNS more frequently than with other local anaesthetics. The answer to this question is, yes. TNS can, however, be caused by all other investigated local anaesthetics; the frequency associated with bupivacaine, prilocaine, procaine, ropivacaine, and levobupivacaine is lower than with lidocaine. Only one study compared lidocaine to new local anaesthetics (ropivacaine and levobupivacaine) with 90 patients, which is not yet enough to conclude that the frequency of TNS with these is less than with lidocaine. Similarly, only one RCT compared the recently reintroduced local anesthetic 2-chloroprocaine with lidocaine, with only 15 patients in each group. There were no cases of TNS in the 2-chloroprocaine group but more studies are necessary to confirm this result. Approximately one in seven patients who received spinal anaesthesia with lidocaine developed TNS.</P>
<P>Pain in the lower back is a very common complication after spinal anaesthesia with any local anaesthetic. Its aetiology is unknown but no connection to neurologic pathology has been suggested in the literature. Lower back pain is different from pain experienced in the buttocks and lower extremities after recovery from spinal anaesthesia, which has been characterized as 'transient neurologic symptoms'; this also shows no evidence of localized nerve damage. Studies with different concentrations and doses of lidocaine have shown that the risk of TNS was not dose- or concentration-dependant (<LINK REF="REF-Freedman-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Freedman 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hampl-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Hampl 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pollock-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Pollock 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tong-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Tong 2003</LINK>). All forms of lidocaine have been associated with TNS: hyperbaric (<LINK REF="STD-Tong-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Tong 2003</LINK>); isobaric (<LINK REF="STD-Hampl-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Hampl 1996</LINK>); and when diluted with cerebrospinal fluid (<LINK REF="STD-Pollock-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Pollock 1999</LINK>). The cause of this painful condition is as yet unknown and none of the speculations on its origin have been substantiated. The term 'transient neurological symptoms' implies neurologic pathology. Failing identification of the pathogenesis of TNS, there should be consideration given to choosing a neutral descriptive term which does not imply a particular causation.</P>
<P>How much does TNS influence patients' level of satisfaction and their rehabilitation? In a recent multicentre RCT (<LINK REF="STD-Tong-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Tong 2003</LINK>), 20% of 453 patients who received spinal anaesthesia with lidocaine for short urological procedures developed TNS. TNS patients had higher pain scores, used more analgesics postoperatively, and experienced higher degrees of functional impairment during the two postoperative days than those who did not develop TNS. Satisfaction was higher in the non-TNS patients (96%) than in TNS patients (89%). However, the proportion of patients who stated they would accept a future spinal anaesthesia was the same (95%). It seems that the transitory pain and functional impairment are not of such degree that they have a negative influence on the patients' decisions to receive spinal anaesthesia in the future. On the other hand, in an epidemiologic study of 1863 patients (<LINK REF="REF-Freedman-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Freedman 1998</LINK>) 30% of the 104 patients who developed TNS after intrathecal lidocaine rated their pain as severe.</P>
<P>Permanent neurologic deficits (varying from radicular symptoms to paralysis and cauda equina) are described after both general and regional anaesthesia. Most cases are multifactorial and not related to any particular form of anaesthesia. They can often be explained by known or unknown pre-existing neurologic pathology, or are the result of incorrect positioning of patients on the operating table. As a matter of fact, the latter is described as the most frequent cause of peripheral nerve injuries, occurring in one out of 350 patients (<LINK REF="REF-Sawyer-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sawyer 2000</LINK>). On the other hand, neurologic sequelae related to anaesthesia are very rare events. Their aetiology is, again, complex and difficult to elucidate. Possible causes are intrathecal haematoma due to the use of anticoagulants (especially low molecular weight heparins) (<LINK REF="REF-Horlocker-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Horlocker 2000</LINK>); spinal cord ischaemia (<LINK REF="REF-Usubiaga-1975" TYPE="REFERENCE">Usubiaga 1975</LINK>); mechanical trauma (<LINK REF="REF-Selander-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Selander 1988</LINK>); and neurotoxicity.</P>
<P>The risk of neurologic sequelae after spinal anaesthesia varies. It depends upon whether studies are retrospective or prospective and the risk varies from 1:10000 in the older literature (<LINK REF="REF-Vandam-1955" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vandam 1955</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vandam-1960" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vandam 1960</LINK>) to the highest risk cited as approximately 1:3000 spinal anaesthesias in a more recent report (<LINK REF="REF-Dahlgren-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dahlgren 1995</LINK>). The events are so rare that no randomized trial relating to this complication has been performed. In the patient population contained in this review, the total number of patients was only 1437 and no neurologic sequelae have been reported. These rare events can be found in the literature as case reports, retrospective and prospective surveys, or as reports from databases for registration of postoperative complications.</P>

<P>The relative risk of developing TNS is about seven times higher for lidocaine than for bupivacaine, prilocaine, procaine, ropivacaine, and levobupivacaine. These painful symptoms disappear completely by the fifth postoperative day. The risk of TNS weighted against the benefit of rapid, short-acting anaesthesia and the patient's viewpoint must be considered in the decision as to whether to use lidocaine for ambulatory anaesthesia. Patients should be informed about this adverse effect and its effective treatment with analgesics. Bupivacaine, prilocaine, and procaine are associated with lower risks of TNS but their longer duration or lower quality of anaesthesia may limit their suitability for ambulatory surgery. There is not yet enough data to make conclusions about ropivacaine and levobupivacaine. Reintroduction of 2-chloroprocaine has so far given promising results. If future studies confirm these results an alternative to lidocaine, without TNS, will be available.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2008-12-05 07:10:04 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>More RCTs are necessary in order to elucidate the frequency of TNS when mepivacaine is used for spinal anaesthesia. Ropivacaine and levobupivacaine are new local anaesthetics and more studies are needed to find out whether they behave like bupivacaine in this regard. The local anaesthetic 2-chlororprocaine, in particular, is a suitable replacement for lidocaine for spinal anesthesia in ambulatory settings. However, more studies are needed to confirm the promising initial results. Likewise more studies with pregnant women are needed to draw conclusions about the frequency of TNS in this patient population.</P>
<P>There is still a lack of precise estimates of the risk of rare events such as permanent neurologic deficits after regional anaesthesia. An international database for registration of serious rare events could be the solution to this problem. Regional anaesthesia societies (such as the European Society of Regional Anaesthesia and Pain Therapy (ESRA), the American Society of Regional Anesthesia (ASRA), and the Latin American Society of Regional Anaesthesia (LASRA)) are obvious candidates for such an important task.</P>
