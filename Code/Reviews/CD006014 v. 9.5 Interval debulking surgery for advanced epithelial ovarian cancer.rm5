<P>Ovarian cancer frequently presents at an advanced stage so it may not be possible to remove all tumours during surgery. Several cycles of chemotherapy are generally given after primary surgery. Secondary surgery, performed after a few cycles of chemotherapy before further cycles of chemotherapy, is called interval debulking surgery (IDS). This review compares the survival of women with advanced epithelial ovarian cancer, who had IDS performed between cycles of chemotherapy after primary surgery, with survival of women who had conventional treatment (primary debulking surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy). It found similar survival rates in women who did and did not receive IDS. Not enough information about adverse effects was available. Information on quality of life of the women was also inconclusive.</P>

Subgroup analysis for OS in two trials, where the primary surgery was not performed by gynaecologic oncologists or was less extensive, showed a benefit of IDS (HR = 0.68, 95% CI 0.53 to 0.87, I² = 0%). Meta-analysis of two trials for PFS found no statistically significant difference between IDS and chemotherapy alone (HR = 0.88, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.33, I² = 83%).

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2016-01-07 15:25:27 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Ovarian cancer is the fourth most common gynaecologic cancer among women, and is the third leading cause of death in women with gynaecological malignancies. Approximately 238,700 new cases and 151,900 deaths of ovarian occurred worldwide in 2012 (<LINK REF="REF-Torre-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Torre 2015</LINK>). Primary surgery is the mainstay of treatment for ovarian cancer, followed by adjuvant chemotherapy to destroy any gross or microscopic residual tumour cells.</P>
<P>Primary ovarian cancer surgery is performed to achieve optimal cytoreduction, as the amount of residual tumour is one of the most important prognostic factors for survival of women with epithelial ovarian cancer (<LINK REF="REF-Griffiths-1975" TYPE="REFERENCE">Griffiths 1975</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hoskin-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hoskin 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bristow-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bristow 2002</LINK>). The definition of optimal debulking surgery has changed over the past 30 years from the residual tumour sized not more than 1 to 2 cms to no macroscopic disease (<LINK REF="REF-Griffiths-1975" TYPE="REFERENCE">Griffiths 1975</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Elattar-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elattar 2011</LINK>). An optimal surgical procedure required for advanced stage disease (III to IV) is not always possible, especially in women whose diseases are extensive. Such surgery can be complicated, requiring extensive bowel resection and major blood loss, with a high risk of morbidity. Another obstacle to extensive primary surgery lies in the women's medical condition, e.g. poor projected performance status or medical contraindications.</P>
<P>Induction chemotherapy can play an alternative role in these circumstances. The term generally describes the administration of chemotherapy to reduce tumour size, allowing further surgery. The term 'neoadjuvant chemotherapy' (NAC) is more specific in that it describes the administration of chemotherapy when primary debulking surgery is not feasible, and only a biopsy is done for histologic diagnosis. However, the two terms are sometimes used interchangeably. In this review, if chemotherapy administration does not fit the definition of NAC, we will use the term induction chemotherapy.</P>
<P>When a few cycles of chemotherapy are administered with some tumour response, secondary surgery may be possible before further chemotherapy is considered. This secondary surgery between the courses of chemotherapy is called interval debulking surgery (IDS). Although the optimal timing of IDS has not been agreed, it is usually performed after two to four cycles of chemotherapy. A longer interval between primary surgery and IDS (with more cycles of chemotherapy) could result in the chemotherapy selectively destroying chemosensitive tumour cells, leaving chemoresistant clones. Many retrospective or prospective non-randomised trials report the beneficial effects of NAC or induction chemotherapy after inoperable advanced ovarian cancer or in those with gross residual diseases, respectively. Chemotherapy may increase the number of women suitable for secondary surgery (IDS); many authors report the rates of optimal resection in IDS after induction chemotherapy ranging from 77% to 94% (<LINK REF="REF-Lawton-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lawton 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jacob-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jacob 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Surwit-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Surwit 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ansquer-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ansquer 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kuhn-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Kuhn 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chan-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Chan 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Morice-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morice 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Giannopoulos-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Giannopoulos 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lee-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Lee 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>Another potential benefit of IDS after NAC or induction chemotherapy, compared to aggressive primary debulking surgery, as reported in retrospective (<LINK REF="REF-Lawton-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lawton 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Morice-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morice 2003</LINK>) and prospective (<LINK REF="STD-Giannopoulos-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Giannopoulos 2006</LINK>) cohort studies, may be lower morbidity, e.g. less blood loss, requirement of intensive care unit admission, and duration of hospital stay due to the tumours being smaller. However, this was not found in another study (<LINK REF="STD-Kuhn-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Kuhn 2001</LINK>). The quality of life (QoL) of women treated with IDS after NAC was also reported in one study to be better than for those who had conventional treatment (primary debulking surgery followed by a complete and continual cycle of adjuvant chemotherapy) (<LINK REF="STD-Chan-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Chan 2003</LINK>). By removing the smaller size tumour masses induced by chemotherapy, IDS would facilitate the response of the residual tumours (if any) or of the microscopic lesions to subsequent chemotherapy.</P>
<P>Unlike the advantages for resectability and response rates which were demonstrated in most studies, there is still conflicting evidence from various studies regarding the survival benefit of IDS after chemotherapy compared to conventional treatment. Most studies of IDS after NAC or induction chemotherapy are non-randomised and retrospective in nature. Many of them show that the survival rates of women who underwent IDS, after suboptimal primary surgery followed by chemotherapy, were similar to those of women who had primary debulking surgery (<LINK REF="REF-Jacob-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jacob 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Surwit-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Surwit 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schwartz-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schwartz 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kayik_x00e7_ioglu-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kayikçioglu 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Morice-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morice 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shibata-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shibata 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Loizzi-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Loizzi 2005</LINK>). Only a few studies reported significantly longer median survival of women who had IDS after chemotherapy than of those who had conventional treatment of primary surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy (<LINK REF="REF-Vergote-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vergote 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kuhn-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Kuhn 2001</LINK>), and even fewer studies showed an inferior result for IDS than for optimal primary cytoreduction (<LINK REF="REF-Fanfani-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fanfani 2003</LINK>). This conflicting result on the survival benefit of IDS may depend on various characteristics of the women and their disease, e.g. extent of residual tumour after primary surgery or IDS, tumour response after induction chemotherapy and prior to IDS, etc. (<LINK REF="REF-Jacob-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jacob 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vergote-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vergote 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kuhn-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Kuhn 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fanfani-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fanfani 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mazzeo-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mazzeo 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>We are aware of three major randomised controlled trials (RCTs) (<LINK REF="STD-Redman-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Redman 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Van-der-Burg-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Van der Burg 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rose-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Rose 2004</LINK>) which have been conducted to evaluate the survival benefit of IDS in ovarian cancer. These trials did not agree on the benefit of survival outcomes for women with IDS. <LINK REF="STD-Redman-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Redman 1994</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Rose-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Rose 2004</LINK> showed similar survival rates between women who had IDS and those who had conventional treatment, while <LINK REF="STD-Van-der-Burg-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Van der Burg 1995</LINK> showed significantly longer survival in the IDS group which was still present after a 10-year follow-up.</P>
<P>One previous meta-analytical study (<LINK REF="REF-Bristow-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bristow 2006</LINK>) and two systematic reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Bristow-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bristow 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Morrison-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morrison 2012</LINK>) addressed the question of whether women with advanced ovarian cancer should have primary surgery before or after chemotherapy. The first meta-analytical study reviewed the role of platinum-based NAC and IDS for advanced ovarian cancer, involving 835 women from 51 studies (<LINK REF="REF-Bristow-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bristow 2006</LINK>). The result showed that the survival of women who had NAC after an attempt at primary surgery was inferior to those who had primary surgery. However, the review included only phase I to II and retrospective studies. The other systematic review of NAC or induction chemotherapy and IDS in advanced ovarian cancer was published in 2007 (<LINK REF="REF-Bristow-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bristow 2007</LINK>). The review included the three major RCTs, six non-randomised studies, and another 26 retrospective and phase I or II studies. The authors categorised the studies into three groups according mainly to the survival outcomes of the women in the NAC or induction chemotherapy/IDS arm compared to the conventional arm: inferior survival outcome by NAC; no significant difference; and those with limited validation of inclusion criteria for NAC. The results from these studies were simply described and tabulated without a meta-analysis for survival. A Cochrane systematic review was conducted on the role of NAC on overall survival of women with ovarian cancer (<LINK REF="REF-Morrison-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morrison 2012</LINK>), and included only one large and high quality randomised trial (<LINK REF="STD-Vergote-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Vergote 2010</LINK>), of 632 eligible women with stage IIIC or IV ovarian cancer allocated either to NAC followed by IDS or to primary debulking surgery (PDS) followed by chemotherapy. Although the completely resection rate was higher in the NAC group (52% versus 20%), no significant differences in overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were found between the study groups. The review authors concluded that NAC was a reasonable alternative in women with bulky stage IIIC to IV ovarian cancer.</P>
<P>The objective of these systematic reviews and meta-analyses was to evaluate the use of NAC in lieu of primary surgery, which is different from the aim of our review which focuses on the role of repeated surgery (IDS) after primary surgery which had been attempted but resulted in suboptimal surgery.</P>
<P>We found only one previous meta-analysis which reviewed the role of IDS after NAC in advanced ovarian cancer (<LINK REF="REF-Elit-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elit 1995</LINK>). The authors of that review identified 33 publications and included three RCTs and three historical cohort trials. Homogeneity testing was not statistically significant by the Breslow-Day method. Significant survival benefit from IDS was identified by a Mantel-Haenszel odds ratio of 0.5 (P = 0.02).</P>
<P>Since there were potentially intrinsic biases of participant selection and variations in several factors, such as chemotherapeutic agents or cycles of administration in many retrospective or phase I and II studies, together with conflicting data from the RCTs, no definite conclusion about the advantage of IDS after attempted primary surgery could be drawn. Hence, a thorough systematic review of this subject is warranted, focusing only on high quality data or trials, to give a stronger assessment of the use of IDS in advanced epithelial ovarian cancers.</P>

<P>All three RCTs were multicentre studies: one from the United Kingdom (UK) involved four institutions which were the referral centres for cancer care (<LINK REF="STD-Redman-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Redman 1994</LINK>); one by the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) involved 14 participating institutions in Europe (<LINK REF="STD-Van-der-Burg-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Van der Burg 1995</LINK>), and one by the Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG) from the United States (USA) involved more than 42 cancer centres (<LINK REF="STD-Rose-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Rose 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>All three of the included trials compared interval debulking surgery (IDS) plus chemotherapy with chemotherapy only.</P>
<P>Median length of follow-up was reported in all three trials: 48 months (<LINK REF="STD-Redman-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Redman 1994</LINK>), 42 months (<LINK REF="STD-Van-der-Burg-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Van der Burg 1995</LINK>), and.47 months (<LINK REF="STD-Rose-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Rose 2004</LINK>). Although Van de Burg and colleagues from the EORTC presented their long-term follow-up (10 years) as an oral presentation in the European Society of Gynaecological Oncology annual meeting in 2005 (<LINK REF="REF-Van-der-Burg-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van der Burg 2005</LINK>), the data were insufficient to include in our meta-analysis.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Redman-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Redman 1994</LINK> supplied data relating to non-assignment of treatment as: death, disease progression, pulmonary embolus, and participant refusal. The other two trials reported only the numbers or percentages of those not undergoing surgery, but the reasons were not stated (<LINK REF="STD-Van-der-Burg-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Van der Burg 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rose-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Rose 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>All three trials reported hazard ratios (HRs) for overall survival (OS). Two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Van-der-Burg-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Van der Burg 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rose-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Rose 2004</LINK>) used Cox regression to assess the prognostic significance of numerous covariates, including age, performance status, stage, tumour grade, response to induction chemotherapy, number of lesions, ascites, and residual diseases or size of tumours at three time points: after primary surgery, before IDS and after IDS. The definitions of optimal debulking or size of residual tumours after primary surgery varied among the trials. Optimal surgery was either defined as less than 2 cms (<LINK REF="STD-Redman-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Redman 1994</LINK>) or more than 1 cm (<LINK REF="STD-Van-der-Burg-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Van der Burg 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rose-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Rose 2004</LINK>). Overall survival was variously calculated from the day of induction chemotherapy initiation at enrolment (<LINK REF="STD-Van-der-Burg-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Van der Burg 1995</LINK>), or from the date of randomisation, which was either after primary surgery but before chemotherapy in <LINK REF="STD-Redman-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Redman 1994</LINK>, or after three cycles of chemotherapy in <LINK REF="STD-Rose-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Rose 2004</LINK>.

The definitions of response and recurrence varied among the trials: <LINK REF="STD-Redman-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Redman 1994</LINK> applied the International Union Against Cancer (UICC) criteria for response evaluation, using physical examination, imaging studies, but not CA125; the EORTC trial (<LINK REF="STD-Van-der-Burg-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Van der Burg 1995</LINK>) used the World Health Organization (WHO) criteria allowing physical examination, imaging studies, and CA125; the GOG trial (<LINK REF="STD-Rose-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Rose 2004</LINK>) also used physical examination, imaging studies, and two CA125 levels two weeks apart, and defined progressive disease as an increase of at least 100 U/ml or a doubling of the nadir in those whose level did not return to baseline.</P>
<P>All three trials reported adverse events. However, <LINK REF="STD-Redman-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Redman 1994</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Van-der-Burg-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Van der Burg 1995</LINK> described postoperative complications only in the IDS groups, while <LINK REF="STD-Rose-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Rose 2004</LINK> compared general adverse effects between the IDS group and the chemotherapy only (control) group.</P>
<P>Quality of life (QoL) was assessed only in the GOG trial, with results reported subsequently by <LINK REF="REF-Wenzel-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wenzel 2005</LINK>.

<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Redman-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Redman 1994</LINK>, from the UK, is the first known RCT of IDS for the management of epithelial ovarian cancer. From April 1986 to February 1990, the authors randomised 86 women with stage II to IV disease, who underwent primary surgery in 25 hospitals by 40 different surgeons and had residual disease greater than 2 cms. It was not clear how experienced the 40 surgeons were, but the primary surgery had to be performed with an attempt to remove as much tumour as possible. Stage IV included only malignant pleural effusion without other evidence of distant spread or unresectable diseases. The women received chemotherapy consisting of either a regimen of cisplatin and cyclophosphamide for eight cycles or a regimen of cisplatin, doxorubicin and bleomycin for three cycles followed by an escalated dose of cyclophosphamide for up to five cycles. Either regimen was given without detailed criteria for regimen selection. The control group had only chemotherapy after primary surgery. The intervention group had chemotherapy for one to four cycles and underwent IDS, which was performed by the primary surgeon, and then received further chemotherapy. Although our inclusion criteria for this review is IDS to be performed after chemotherapy for a minimum of two cycles, this study is included because only one out of 37 women in the IDS group had only one cycle of chemotherapy before IDS. Interval debulking surgery was not performed if there was progressive disease, stable disease, or insufficient response after three cycles.</P>
<P>Seven of the 86 randomised women were excluded after randomisation because primary surgery was not suboptimal. Of the remaining 79 women, 37 were in the IDS arm and 42 in the conventional arm. There were no significant differences between arms in participant or disease characteristics. Overall, 25 women (68%) in the intervention arm actually underwent IDS. The reasons for not performing IDS in 12 participants (32%) were: death or progressive disease, pulmonary embolism, and participant refusal. In the conventional arm, one woman (2%) had IDS upon request.</P>
<P>Adverse effects of IDS were reported as perioperative death and significant postoperative complications, including deep vein thrombosis, intestinal fistulae, chest or wound infections, or postoperative ileus. Adverse effects in the chemotherapy only group were not exhaustively reported. Toxicity was reported in both treatment groups.</P>

Their primary report described neither the extent nor the aim of primary surgery, nor the expertise of the surgeon. However, the authors provided additional data in their reply to a letter to the Editor of the New England Journal of Medicine (<LINK REF="REF-Kehoe-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kehoe 1995</LINK>), and in their subsequent review article (<LINK REF="REF-Van-der-Burg-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van der Burg 2003</LINK>). They reported that the maximum effort to perform primary surgery was not attempted in all patients with different extents of debulking surgery, resulting in a high proportion of large residual tumours (more than 5 cms) after primary surgery (<LINK REF="REF-Van-der-Burg-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van der Burg 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>All patients received three cycles of chemotherapy consisting of intravenous cisplatin and cyclophosphamide. Those who had response or stable diseases were randomised to undergo IDS or no IDS. Both groups would receive three more cycles of the same chemotherapy, with continuation after six cycles determined by institution policy.</P>
<P>Overall, 106 women were not randomised; this number consisted of 39 with progressive disease who were removed from the study, and also those who had contraindications to surgery, had died, had declined to participate in the study, were ineligible, or were lost to follow-up, and those who were still receiving induction chemotherapy.</P>
<P>Of 319 women randomised, 278 were evaluated (140 women who underwent surgery and 138 who did not).

The rate of optimal debulking surgery (residual tumour less than 1 cm) was 64%.</P>

The primary surgeons were either fellowship-trained or certified gynaecologic oncologists for 95% of participants. Those whose disease had not progressed and who had residual extraperitoneal tumour of less than 1 cm after three cycles of chemotherapy with paclitaxel and cisplatin were randomly assigned to secondary surgical cytoreduction (IDS) and further chemotherapy, or to chemotherapy alone. Overall, 102 women were not randomised; the most common reasons were: progressive disease or death in 40 women, while the remainder were either medically contra-indicated, had declined, had extraperitoneal disease greater than 1 cm, had experienced excessive delay before randomisation, or for other unspecified reasons.</P>
<P>A total of 448 women were randomised: 226 were allocated to IDS and 222 to chemotherapy only. Participant characteristics were well balanced between the two groups. A considerable number of women in both groups had protocol violations, including: 7% in the IDS group did not have secondary surgery, versus 3% in the chemotherapy only arm who did receive surgery; 7% and 2% in the IDS and chemotherapy only arms respectively had fewer than three cycles of additional chemotherapy; and 10% and 13% in the IDS and chemotherapy only arms respectively had non-protocol consolidation therapy before progressive disease. All randomised women were included in the analysis of OS and PFS, and were counted in the group comparisons.</P>
<P>We performed Cox regression for OS and PFS to evaluate the prognostic importance of: the maximal diameter of residual tumour (2.0 cms or less, 2.1 to 5.0 cms, or 5.0 cms or more) after initial surgery, age, performance status, the presence or absence of measurable disease before chemotherapy, and the size of residual tumour after IDS (less than 1 cm versus more than 1 cm).</P>
<P>Quality of life (QoL) of those who did and did not undergo IDS in the GOG study was evaluated and subsequently reported by <LINK REF="REF-Wenzel-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wenzel 2005</LINK>. The self reported QoL was assessed in four settings, according to the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Ovarian (FACT-O), version 2-questionnaire, which consists of 33 general questions for cancer patients and 12 questions specific to those with ovarian cancer. The first evaluation was at baseline after primary surgery and the third cycle of chemotherapy, but before allocation to IDS or chemotherapy only. The three subsequent evaluations were at the sixth cycle of chemotherapy, and at six and at 12 months after starting treatment. Completion rates for these questionnaires declined from 90% for the first questionnaire to 83%, 83%, and 80% for the second, third, and fourth questionnaires respectively. Nevertheless, lower completion rates were noted in the IDS group compared to the chemotherapy only group, especially at the second assessment, 77% and 89%, respectively (P &lt; 0.001).</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2013-03-04 14:21:02 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Cahill">
<P>Our systematic review includes three randomised controlled trials (RCTs), which evaluated 781 women out of 853 randomised, and a further RCT in abstract form which randomised 718 women, but it was unclear how many of these were evaluated. These four RCTs provide inconclusive evidence as to whether interval debulking surgery (IDS) improves or worsens the overall survival rate of patients. The random-effects model showed substantial heterogeneity between the results of the three trials. Similarly, meta-analysis of two RCTs which evaluated 702 women out of 767 randomised, provides inconclusive evidence about whether IDS improves or worsens progression-free survival; again, there was substantial heterogeneity between the trials.</P>
<P>There are potential reasons for the inconclusive evidence so far. Firstly, the small number of included studies, evaluating 781 women, may not have had adequate statistical power to detect a small effect. Furthermore, the studies had different characteristics, which may explain the heterogeneity in their results.</P>
<P>A major difference between these trials was the expertise and/or the level of effort given by the surgeons performing the primary debulking surgical procedures in the participating institutions in each study, which may partly explain the heterogeneity between trials. The majority of operations in the Gynecological Oncology Group (GOG) trial were performed by gynaecologic oncologists or fellowship-trained surgeons in various cancer centres (<LINK REF="STD-Rose-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Rose 2004</LINK>), while the surgical procedures in <LINK REF="STD-Redman-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Redman 1994</LINK> were performed mostly by general surgeons or gynaecologists in various hospitals. In the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) trial, where the expertise of the surgeon was not specified (<LINK REF="STD-Van-der-Burg-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Van der Burg 1995</LINK>) but was subsequently revealed in other publications (<LINK REF="REF-Kehoe-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kehoe 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Van-der-Burg-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van der Burg 2003</LINK>), the maximum effort to perform primary surgery was not attempted in all patients with different extents of debulking surgery. Since there is substantial evidence from many retrospective studies that the extent of optimal surgery affects the survival of patients with epithelial ovarian cancer (<LINK REF="REF-Griffiths-1975" TYPE="REFERENCE">Griffiths 1975</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hoskin-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hoskin 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bristow-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bristow 2002</LINK>), the maximum primary surgical efforts in the optimal surgical setting in the GOG trial might indicate that their primary surgery was sufficient and that subsequent surgical attempts would not further affect survival. Compared to <LINK REF="STD-Redman-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Redman 1994</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Van-der-Burg-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Van der Burg 1995</LINK>, in which primary surgery was performed in suboptimal settings without gynaecologic oncologists (<LINK REF="STD-Redman-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Redman 1994</LINK>), without maximum effort (with less extensive primary debulking surgery) resulting in a high proportion of large residual tumours (<LINK REF="REF-Kehoe-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kehoe 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Van-der-Burg-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Van der Burg 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Van-der-Burg-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van der Burg 2003</LINK>), so the secondary surgery (IDS) after the tumours were down-sized by chemotherapy appeared worthwhile, although significant only in the EORTC trial. Our subgroup meta-analysis confirmed that IDS had benefits in this particular subgroup of women. Nevertheless, this should be interpreted with caution because our subgroup analysis was based on only two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Redman-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Redman 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Van-der-Burg-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Van der Burg 1995</LINK>).</P>
<P>The second minor difference between the trials is the timing of randomisation. <LINK REF="STD-Redman-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Redman 1994</LINK> was the only trial which randomised participants into two groups (to have or not to have IDS) at the start of the trial, and only 67% of those in the IDS group actually underwent surgery, because the remainder had disease progression or died before IDS. The other two larger trials randomised only the patients who showed some response to induction chemotherapy (<LINK REF="STD-Van-der-Burg-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Van der Burg 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rose-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Rose 2004</LINK>); this resulted in a high percentage of the women (approximately 93% in both trials) who were randomised actually undergoing IDS. This difference may affect the results of each trial, based on an intention-to-treat analysis.</P>
<P>We explored the women's disease characteristics as another potential reason for different effects of IDS on survival outcomes: <LINK REF="STD-Redman-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Redman 1994</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Rose-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Rose 2004</LINK> did not show any advantage of IDS, while <LINK REF="STD-Van-der-Burg-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Van der Burg 1995</LINK> showed significant survival improvement with IDS. <LINK REF="STD-Redman-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Redman 1994</LINK> evaluated only 79 of the total of 86 women included in the meta-analysis of OS and, therefore had limited weight in the results of the meta-analysis. The difference in outcomes from <LINK REF="STD-Rose-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Rose 2004</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Van-der-Burg-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Van der Burg 1995</LINK> may be due to the different proportion of women who had a poor response to induction chemotherapy, and who generally had poorer prognoses than those who showed some response: approximately 52% of women in the GOG trial had residual diseases of more than 1 cm after induction chemotherapy (<A HREF="../../../../application%20data/microsoft/word/rose%202004">Rose 2004</A>), compared to 44% in the EORTC trial (<LINK REF="STD-Van-der-Burg-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Van der Burg 1995</LINK>). This might be interpreted as the GOG trial having a higher proportion of participants with more aggressive tumours who would not benefit from any treatment, even optimal IDS. However, this mechanism of tumour aggression and prognosis may not solely explain the women's ultimate outcome, because the women in the EORTC trial who had a tumour greater than 1 cm after induction chemotherapy but which was reduced to less than 1 cm had better survival rates than any other group of women in the trial. This might suggest that IDS may play some role in survival improvement.</P>
<P>To emphasize the importance of the sensitivity of response to chemotherapy before IDS, we would draw attention to the findings from the GOG and EORTC trials which showed that the women whose tumour masses were reduced by chemotherapy to less than 1 cm before the IDS (<LINK REF="STD-Van-der-Burg-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Van der Burg 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rose-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Rose 2004</LINK>) had better survival than the other groups. This response to chemotherapy might be used as a selection criterion for the women who are most likely to gain survival benefit from an IDS procedure.</P>
<P>As we have mentioned in the results, meta-analysis of adverse events was not possible due to different formats of presentation of data in each RCT. The only obvious advantage appears to be fewer neurologic complications in the IDS group than in the chemotherapy only group in the GOG trial (<LINK REF="STD-Rose-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Rose 2004</LINK>). However, this adverse effect may be related to a particular drug and might not be experienced in other settings using different chemotherapeutic regimens.</P>
<P>For the quality of life (QoL) comparison, which was only assessed by the GOG trial (<LINK REF="REF-Wenzel-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wenzel 2005</LINK>), women in the chemotherapy only arm had a higher rate of neurotoxicity than did those in the IDS arm at one of the four time points at which they were assessed, despite a similar total dose of chemotherapy exposures. The authors ascribe this finding to intermission from chemotherapy exposure allowing a certain degree of recovery, but it may be a chance finding, as 48 tests of possible differences in QoL were made. Although other aspects of QoL were similar in the two groups of women at every time point, definitive conclusions cannot be drawn, because a significantly lower proportion of women in the IDS group completed the QoL questionnaires in the second assessment compared to those in the chemotherapy only group, and it is possible that this lower questionnaire completion rate may be associated with QoL.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2013-03-04 14:22:14 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Cahill">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2013-03-04 14:22:14 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Cahill">
<P>The heterogeneity of the results in our review precludes any definitive guidance or recommendations for clinical practice. Without strong evidence to support the superiority of interval debulking surgery (IDS) in combination with chemotherapy over conventional primary surgery and chemotherapy, a clinician may remain unconvinced of the benefit of IDS instead of aggressive primary surgery for a woman with advanced ovarian cancer. The choice of extensive primary surgery or upfront chemotherapy followed by IDS must be individualized to each patient. Since we found a benefit of IDS in the subgroup of women whose primary surgery had not been performed under optimal conditions by the oncologic surgeons or without maximum surgical effort, we suggest that IDS may improve patient survival in this setting. However, if the primary surgery has already been performed by the oncologic surgeons or with maximal surgical effort, IDS may not yield any further benefit for survival. Nevertheless, in a situation when there is evidence that primary surgery would be impossible or that morbidity from surgery would outweigh the benefit, induction chemotherapy followed by IDS may have a role to play.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2013-03-04 10:29:57 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Cahill">
<P>The theoretical benefit of IDS needs further well-designed randomised controlled trials to generate evidence which may resolve the equivocal findings of this review.</P>
<P>These studies should focus on a comparison of current conventional primary surgery with adjuvant chemotherapy versus neoadjuvant chemotherapy (without any attempt to remove the bulk of tumours except a biopsy for histologic diagnosis) followed by IDS, and then by further chemotherapy.</P>
<P>The level and expertise of the surgeon or the effort in performing the primary surgery should be standardised as far as possible, in order to obtain the best surgical outcome. The particular subgroup of women with their specific disease characteristics should be a set criterion for IDS, e.g. patients with only small tumours after induction or neoadjuvant chemotherapy.<BR/>

Second-look surgery or surgical re-exploration were also performed on those with clinical complete remission or on those with complications requiring surgery, respectively.</P>

<P>This RCT compared the role of PDS followed by adjuvant chemotherapy in the control arm with NAC before IDS followed by additional chemotherapy in the study arm. However, IDS was also allowed in the PDS arm too, at the discretion of the physician. Furthermore, either histologic or cytologic diagnosis (with tumour marker and imaging criteria to exclude cancers of other non-Mullerian origins) was allowed. </P>
