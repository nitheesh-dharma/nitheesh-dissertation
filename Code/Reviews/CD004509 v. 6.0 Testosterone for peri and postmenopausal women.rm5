<B>The role of testosterone in women</B>
<BR/>Biological data support important physiological effects of testosterone in women. Testosterone acts directly via androgen receptors throughout the body, including in areas such as the brain, particularly the hypothalamus and amygdala; and at peripheral sites including bone, breast, skin, skeletal muscle, and adipose, vascular, and genital tissues (<LINK REF="STD-Davis-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Davis 1995</LINK>). The effects of testosterone are also mediated by aromatization to oestrogens as androgens are the essential precursor hormones for oestrogen biosynthesis in the ovaries and extra-gonadal tissues (<LINK REF="REF-Simpson-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Simpson 2000</LINK>). Imbalance in androgen biosynthesis or metabolism in women may have undesirable effects on any or all of these systems. Exogenous testosterone may influence sexual desire, bone mineral density, muscle mass, adipose tissue distribution, mood, energy, and psychological well being (<LINK REF="STD-Burger-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Burger 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Burger-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Burger 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Davis-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Davis 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sherwin-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Sherwin 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sherwin-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Sherwin 1988</LINK>). Recognised causes of low testosterone production include hypopituitarism, adrenal insufficiency, premature ovarian failure, bilateral oophorectomy, oral glucocorticosteroid therapy, and oral oestrogen therapy (<LINK REF="STD-Davis-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Davis 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bachmann-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bachmann 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Burger-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burger 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<B>Effects of menopause on testosterone levels</B>
<BR/>Most studies addressing the changes in androgen levels with age have been limited by: the inclusion of small numbers of women with limited age ranges (<LINK REF="REF-Labrie-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Labrie 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zumoff-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zumoff 1995</LINK>), reproductive status (<LINK REF="REF-Pfeilschifter-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pfeilschifter 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Randolph-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Randolph 2003</LINK>), insensitivity of assays for the measurement of total and free testosterone levels in the female range (<LINK REF="REF-Burger-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burger 2000</LINK>) and, for blood sampling, failure to take into account the cyclical variations in androgen levels (<LINK REF="REF-Overlie-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Overlie 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rannevik-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rannevik 1995</LINK>). In the late reproductive years there is a loss of the midcycle rise in free testosterone that characterizes the menstrual cycle in young ovulating women (<LINK REF="REF-Mushayandebvu-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mushayandebvu 1996</LINK>). To establish whether testosterone levels decline during the menopause transition, it is necessary to measure testosterone at times other than during the early follicular phase nadir that is evident in premenopausal women. A large cross-sectional study of 1423 women aged 18 to 75 years, randomly recruited from the community, and not seeking health care was undertaken to document androgen levels by decade of age (<LINK REF="REF-Davison-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davison 2005</LINK>). Total testosterone was measured by a direct, manual radioimmunoassay method which is a clinically useful assay for the study of the 'low' testosterone levels within the female population. Free testosterone was calculated using the Sodergard equation (<LINK REF="REF-Sodergard-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sodergard 1982</LINK>). This free testosterone estimate has been demonstrated to have a strong correlation with levels measured by equilibrium dialysis, which is generally considered the most accurate method of measuring free testosterone. The results of the study showed a decline in total and free testosterone, dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate (DHEAS), and androstenedione with age, commencing in the mid 30s (<LINK REF="REF-Davison-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davison 2005</LINK>). An effect of natural menopause on circulating androgen levels was not found, which contrasts with the sharp decline in estradiol that occurs at this time (<LINK REF="REF-Davison-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davison 2005</LINK>). These findings provide suggestive data that testosterone levels do not change across the menopause transition. In the same study postmenopausal oophorectomised women had lower total and free testosterone levels than non-oophorectomised women, suggesting that the postmenopausal ovary remains a source of testosterone production.</P>
<P>
<B>Proposed female androgen insufficiency syndrome</B>
<BR/>It has been proposed that insufficient testosterone production in women may result in lowered sexual desire and arousal, and diminished well being (<LINK REF="REF-Bachmann-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bachmann 2002</LINK>). However, there are no substantial data to support this hypothesis and no 'cut-off' level of testosterone has been demonstrated as a diagnostic indicator of female androgen insufficiency. In contrast, in women younger than 45 years low domain scores for desire, arousal, and responsiveness were associated with higher odds of having DHEAS levels in the lowest 10th centile. In women over 45 years of age a low domain score for responsiveness was associated with higher odds of having DHEAS levels in the lowest 10th centile (<LINK REF="STD-Davis-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Davis 2003</LINK>). The concept of female androgen insufficiency is primarily supported by results from therapeutic trials. However, demonstration of the clinical efficacy of testosterone therapy is only surrogate evidence for a female androgen insufficiency syndrome, which still remains to be appropriately researched.</P>

<P>
<B>Testosterone therapy for postmenopausal women</B>
<BR/>Results from several randomised controlled trials suggest that testosterone therapy has additional benefits for the health of postmenopausal women when compared with the use of HT alone. Proposed benefits include effects on sexual function, mood, bone density, and increased lean body mass (<LINK REF="STD-Burger-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Burger 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Burger-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Burger 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Davis-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Davis 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sherwin-1987a" TYPE="STUDY">Sherwin 1987a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shifren-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Shifren 2000</LINK>). These studies have not been systematically reviewed. Based on clinical data, potential risks of testosterone therapy include acne, excess facial and body hair, deepening of the voice, weight gain, emotional changes, and adverse effects on lipid profiles (<LINK REF="REF-Bachmann-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bachmann 2002</LINK>). Lower high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, increased hematocrit, and abnormal liver function tests have been reported with higher doses of oral methyltestosterone (<LINK REF="REF-Bachmann-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bachmann 2002</LINK>). Cases of hepatotoxicity were associated with oral administration of methyltestosterone in men treated with dosages of 10 to 100 mg/day (<LINK REF="REF-Foss-1959" TYPE="REFERENCE">Foss 1959</LINK>). The incidence of toxic hepatitis in a study that involved 572,794 women who were exposed to oral esterified oestrogen plus methyltestosterone was 3 per 100,000 person-years (<LINK REF="REF-Ettinger-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ettinger 1998</LINK>). The long-term effects of testosterone on breast and other cancers, cardiovascular disease, and stroke is unknown. As androgens are converted to oestrogens in vivo oestrogenic side effects are also potential consequences of androgen therapy, such as effects on the breast and endometrium.</P>

<P>
<B>Mechanism of action of testosterone</B>
</P>
<P>Testosterone may act in a variety of ways in the different tissues but this is an area that requires further investigation. Primarily the testosterone action is likely to be directly via the androgen receptor (AR). However, testosterone is an important precursor for oestradiol production in target tissues. Thus the testosterone action may be as a consequence of conversion to oestradiol and then genomically via alpha or beta oestrogen receptors (ER), or non-genomically via other oestrogenic mechanisms. Grohe et al reported a series of elegant experiments in which they demonstrated local oestrogen biosynthesis from testosterone in cardiac myocytes and the subsequent activation of ER alpha and beta and downstream target genes, in a gender-based fashion. In a mechanistic randomised controlled trial of oestrogen replete postmenopausal women, aromatase inhibition did not alter the effects of testosterone therapy on improved sexual function, mood, and well being. Testosterone levels were restored to within the normal premenopausal range.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2009-03-18 13:32:54 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="jane clarke">
<P>In our first version of this Cochrane review, a meta-analysis of two (and for some outcomes three) fair quality, randomised, controlled trials (<LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>) comparing hormone therapy (HT) alone and with testosterone (T+HT) indicated that the latter improved libido by 0.42 points (95% CI 0.18 to 0.66), the mean composite score for sexual function by 0.41 points (95% CI 0.15 to 0.67), and the mean score for sexual activity by 1.00 point (95% CI 0.4 to 1.58). Thus, the evidence supported the beneficial effect of testosterone therapy on sexual health among postmenopausal women. A decrease in HDL cholesterol levels was a significant adverse effect. The discontinuation rate was not significantly greater with testosterone therapy than with HT alone. There was insufficient evidence of a treatment effect for other outcomes.</P>
<P>For the Cochrane Review the results from this small number of studies were pooled so that the power of the meta-analysis to provide conclusions about efficacy and safety was limited. In addition, the meta-analysis combined studies using different testosterone regimens. It was thus difficult to estimate the effect of testosterone on sexual function in association with any individual HT formulation. Moreover, the subgroup analysis according to type of menopause, natural versus surgical, was not performed due to the limited number of studies. Therefore, it was uncertain as to whether the benefits and risks would differ according to type of menopause.</P>
<P>Since the cut-off date for publications in the initial Cochrane review, several clinical trials of testosterone therapy in postmenopausal women have been published (<LINK REF="STD-Braunstein-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Braunstein 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Buster-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Buster 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chiuve-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Chiuve 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Davis-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Davis 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Floter-2002b" TYPE="STUDY">Floter 2002b</LINK>;<LINK REF="STD-Floter-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Floter 2004</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Floter-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Floter 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Leao-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Leao 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Matthews-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Matthews 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nathrost_x002d_Boos--2006" TYPE="STUDY">Nathrost-Boos 2006</LINK>;<LINK REF="STD-Nathorst_x002d_B_x00f6__x00f6_s-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Nathorst-Böös 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shifren-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Shifren 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Simon-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Simon 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Warnock-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Warnock 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zang-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Zang 2006</LINK>). Inclusion of these recent trials in this review increases the power of the meta-analyses to provide precise conclusions about efficacy and safety and so provide valuable evidence for clinical practice.</P>

<P>The search strategy of the Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group (MDSG) (see Review Group details for more information) was used for the identification of randomised controlled trials (RCTs). All trials conducted from 1966 onwards were examined for eligibility regardless of language.<BR/>
<BR/>1) The MDSG Trials Register was searched for any trials using a combination of terms (menopause, post menopause, testosterone, androgens, and oestrogen) present in the title, abstract, or keywords section. See the Review Group for more details on the make-up of the Specialised Register.<BR/>2) The following electronic databases were searched using Ovid software:<BR/>MEDLINE (1966 to 21st July 2008);<BR/>EMBASE (1980 to 21st July 2008);<BR/>Bio Abstracts (1980 to 21st July 2008);<BR/>CINAHL (1982 to 21st July 2008);<BR/>PsycINFO (1974 to 21st July 2008).</P>

<P>3) The MetaRegister of Controlled Trials (mRCT), which contains a number of databases of recent or ongoing trials, was searched for any trials with the following words: postmenopause, androgen, testosterone, oestrogen. This meta-database includes the National Research Register (NRR), entries from the Medical Research Council's Clinical Trials Register, and details on reviews in progress collected by the NHS Centre for Reviews and Dissemination.</P>
<P>4) Additional unpublished trials were identified from citation lists of relevant articles, communication with the corresponding authors of relevant articles, experts, and pharmaceutical companies.</P>
<P>5) The MDSG Specialised Register also included results from handsearching the following relevant journals for RCTs. We searched for any trials on androgen or testosterone that involved peri and postmenopausal women in:<BR/>
<BR/>Acta Europaea Fertilitatis (1969 to 1989 infertility RCTs only, 1990 on);<BR/>American Journal of Reproductive Immunology and Microbiology (1980 to 1990);<BR/>Andrologia (1980 to 1990 searched for infertility RCTs only, 1991 on);<BR/>Archives of Andrology (1978 to 1992 searched for infertility RCTs only, 1993 on);<BR/>Climacteric (1998 on);<BR/>Epidemiology (1990 to 1995);<BR/>Fertility and Sterility (1950 on);<BR/>Gynecological Endocrinology (1987 on);<BR/>Gynaecological Endoscopy (1991 on);<BR/>Human Reproduction (1986 on);<BR/>International Journal of Andrology (1978 to 1992 searched for infertility RCTs only, 1993 on);<BR/>International Journal of Fertility and Women's Medicine (previously International Journal of Fertility Menopausal Studies and International Journal of Fertility) 1968 - ongoing<BR/>Journal of Andrology (1980 to 1990 searched for infertility RCTs only, 1991 on);<BR/>Journal of Assisted Reproduction and Genetics (formerly Journal of In Vitro Fertility and Embryo Transfer, 1984 to 1991), 1984 to 1992 searched for infertility RCTs only, 1993 on);<BR/>Journal of Reproduction and Fertility (1966 to 1990 searched for infertility RCTs only, 1992 on);<BR/>Maturitas (1978 on);<BR/>Molecular Reproduction and Development (Formerly Gamete Research, 1978 to 1990) (1978 to 1992 infertility RCTs only, 1993 on);<BR/>Pediatric Perinatal Epidemiology (1987 to 1995);<BR/>Reproduction, Fertility, and Development (Clinical Reproduction and Fertility, 1982 to 1990) (1982 to 1993 searched for infertility RCTs only, 1982 on).</P>

<P>1) Study selection<BR/>Selection of trials was performed by one of the review authors (WS) after employing the search strategy described above. WS obtained copies of the full text articles and made copies in which details of the authors and institutions had been struck out and the results section removed for RB. Each study identified by the search strategy was independently assessed against the inclusion criteria by two of the review authors (RB and WS). If necessary, SD sought additional information from the principal investigators of the study. If there was any study that did not contain enough detail to be examined, that study was listed in the awaiting assessment section of the review.</P>
<P>2) Assessment of methodological quality<BR/>Included trials were independently assessed by two of the review authors (RB and WS) for the following quality criteria and methodological details, using the standard checklist developed by the MDSG. Any disagreement in eligibility or quality assessment was discussed in detail. Major quality criteria were established to enable future sensitivity analyses.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Trial characteristics</HEADING>

<P>This information was presented in the table 'Characteristics of included studies' and provided a context for discussing the reliability of the results.</P>
<P>3) Data collection<BR/>WS then provided RB with the results sections of the included studies and both review authors independently extracted information using the pro forma's designed by the Review Group. Discrepancies were resolved by discussion and a third review author (SD), if necessary. For each included trial, information was collected regarding the location of the study, methods of the study (as per the quality assessment checklist), the participants (age range, eligibility criteria), the nature of the interventions, and data relating to the outcomes, as follows.<BR/>
<BR/>
<I>Characteristics of the study participants</I>
<BR/>1. Age and menopausal status<BR/>2. Criteria for confirming menopausal status<BR/>3. Natural versus surgically induced menopause<BR/>4. The location of the study, and source of recruitment of participants<BR/>5. Ethnicity<BR/>6. Inclusion criteria<BR/>7. Exclusion criteria<BR/>8. Baseline quality of treatment groups</P>
<P>A. Groups balanced in terms of age and other variables(dependent on outcome of interest), e.g. baseline sexual function score, well-being score, bone mineral density, lipid profile, body composition, menopausal symptoms, cognition, and hormonal profile<BR/>B. Groups not balanced<BR/>C. Balance not reported</P>
<P>
<I>Intervention used</I>
<BR/>1. Types of therapies used<BR/>2. Mode of administration<BR/>3. Doses administered<BR/>4. Duration of treatment</P>
<P>Outcomes relevant to this analysis were as follows.<BR/>Benefits: sense of well being, improvement of unexplained fatigue, sexual functioning, bone health, body composition, cognition, and menopausal symptoms.<BR/>Risks: hirsutism, acne, mood alteration, breast cancer, coronary heart disease, haematocrit, lipid profile, coagulation profile, and discontinuation rate.</P>
<P>Where possible, missing data were sought from the authors by SD.<BR/>
<BR/>4) Analysis<BR/>Statistical analysis was performed in accordance with the guidelines for statistical analysis developed by the Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group. Heterogeneity (variation) between the results of different studies was examined by inspecting the scatter in the data points on the graphs and the overlap in their confidence intervals and, more formally, by checking the results of the chi square tests. Where possible, the outcomes were pooled statistically.</P>
<P>The following outcomes were presented as follows, if the information was available.</P>
<P>
<B>1. Primary outcomes</B>
<BR/>1.1. Sense of well being (as the percentage of women who improved or did not improve, mean or median of per cent change)<BR/>1.2. Unexplained fatigue (as the percentage of women who improved or did not improve, mean or median of per cent change)<BR/>1.3. Sexual function (as percentage of women who improved or did not improve, mean or median of per cent change)</P>
<P>
<B>2. Secondary outcomes</B>
<BR/>2.1. Benefits<BR/>2.1.1. bone health:<BR/>2.1.1.1. incidence of osteoporotic fracture (the number of osteoporotic fractures per year in each treatment group),<BR/>2.1.1.2. biochemical markers (as the percentage of women for whom there was an increase, no change, or a decrease in each marker; mean or median of per cent change in each marker),<BR/>2.1.1.3. bone mineral density (as percentage of women for whom there was an increase, no change, or decrease at each site (femur, lumbar spines, wrist); mean or median of per cent change at each site);<BR/>2.1.2. body composition (percentage of women for whom there was an increase, no change, or decrease; mean or median of percentage change in each value);<BR/>2.1.3. cognition (percentage of women who improved or did not improve; mean or median of percentage change);<BR/>2.1.4. menopausal symptoms (percentage of women who improved or did not improve; mean or median of percentage change).<BR/>2.2. Adverse events:<BR/>2.2.1. increased facial and body hair growth (percentage of women who did or did not have a change in score or who reported this side effect);<BR/>2.2.2. acne (percentage of women who have or do not have the side effect);<BR/>2.2.3. mood alteration, specifically aggression (percentage of women who experienced an increase, no change, or decrease);<BR/>2.2.4. breast cancer,<BR/>2.2.4.1. breast cell proliferation (percentage of  women with decreased, stable, or increased breast cell proliferation),</P>
<P>2.2.4.2. mammographic finding (percentage of women with decreased, stable, or increased mammographic density or difference in mean dense area),<BR/>2.2.4.3. incidence of breast cancer (as percentage of women who did or did not develop breast cancer);<BR/>2.2.5. coronary heart disease (as the number of events per year);<BR/>2.2.6. discontinuation rate (percentage of women who discontinued treatment);<BR/>2.2.7. haematocrit (percentage of women for whom there was an increase, no change, or decrease; mean or median of percentage change);<BR/>2.2.8. lipid profile (percentage of women for whom there was an increase, no change, or decrease; mean or median of per cent change in each value);<BR/>2.2.9. coagulation profile (mean or median of percentage change).</P>
<P>The criteria for improvement in the particular outcomes were as defined by the trialist's.<BR/>
<BR/>For dichotomous data, results for each study were expressed as an odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) and combined for meta-analysis with RevMan software using the Peto method and a fixed-effect model.</P>
<P>For continuous data, results from each study were expressed as a weighted mean difference (WMD) with 95% CI and combined for meta-analysis. The fixed-effect model was used to calculate a simple weighted average of the study results. However if there was statistical heterogeneity (the test for heterogeneity results in a P-value of 0.05 or less), the random-effects model was used and reasons for the heterogeneity were explored and discussed. However, standardized mean differences were used if it was necessary to summarize results across studies with continuous data outcomes that were conceptually the same but were measured in different ways. Meta-analytic methods for continuous data assumed that the underlying distribution of the measurements was normal. Where data were skewed and results were reported in the publication as median and range using non-parametric tests of significance, the results were also reported in the 'Other data' section of the review (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>).</P>
<P>Despite the lack of statistical heterogeneity, differences in clinical parameters were considerable (clinical heterogeneity). These differences were taken into account when analysing and interpreting the pooled results.</P>
<P>Sensitivity analysis was performed to look at the possible contribution of unpublished studies (if there were any), differences in methodological quality of trials, very large studies, length of the treatment follow-up period, and different dosages. We suspected results might differ significantly between groups in these sensitivity analyses, which were only performed if there were at least five trials in each group. With event rate data, the analysis was repeated using the risk difference and relative risk.<BR/>
<BR/>Subgroup analyses were performed according to surgical or natural menopause; perimenopause and postmenopause; oral and non-oral HT; methyltestosterone or testosterone; trial duration of less than three months or three to &lt; six months, six to 12 months, or 12 months to 24 months; placebo-controlled trials or non placebo-controlled trials; and adequacy of symptom control.</P>
<P>Where there was an adequate number of studies, a funnel plot was drawn to examine the possibility of publication bias. The review will be updated every two years.</P>

<P>1. Study inclusion<BR/>Ninety articles were assessed for inclusion in the review. Six of these did not contain sufficient information in their published format and were classified as awaiting assessment. We attempted to contact the authors in each case. Thirty-six articles were excluded and 49 were included. Among the 49 included references, there were 35 separate trials. The articles that were from the same trials were as follows: (1) <LINK REF="STD-Davis-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Davis 1995</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Davis-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Davis 2000</LINK>b; (2) <LINK REF="STD-Dobs-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Dobs 2002</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Basaria-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Basaria 2002</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Nguyen-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Nguyen 1999</LINK>, and <LINK REF="STD-Wisniewski-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Wisniewski 2002</LINK>; (3) <LINK REF="STD-Miller-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 2000</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Luciano-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Luciano 1998</LINK>a, and <LINK REF="STD-Luciano-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Luciano 1999</LINK>; (4) <LINK REF="STD-Barrett_x002d_Connor-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Barrett-Connor 1999</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Barrett_x002d_Connor-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Barrett-Connor 1996</LINK>; (5) <LINK REF="STD-Sherwin-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Sherwin 1988</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Sherwin-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Sherwin 1984</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Sherwin-1985a" TYPE="STUDY">Sherwin 1985a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sherwin-1985b" TYPE="STUDY">Sherwin 1985b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sherwin-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sherwin 1985</LINK>c; (6) <LINK REF="STD-Floter-2002b" TYPE="STUDY">Floter 2002b</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Floter-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Floter 2004</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Floter-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Floter 2005</LINK>; and (7) <LINK REF="STD-Hofling-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Hofling 2007</LINK>a and <LINK REF="STD-Hofling-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Hofling 2007</LINK>b.

<P>Of the 36 excluded articles, the reasons for exclusion were: non randomization(13 studies), no HT group serving as a control group (10 studies), ineligible outcomes (9 studies), ineligible intervention (2 studies), and ineligible participants (2 studies). <BR/>
<BR/>2. Participants<BR/>For all the included trials there was a total of 4768 participants randomised. Five of 35 trials did not report the number of participants who completed the study (<LINK REF="STD-Chiuve-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Chiuve 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dow-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Dow 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Garnett-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Garnett 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hofling-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Hofling 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Regestein-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Regestein 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Watts-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Watts 1995</LINK>). Therefore, of 4445 randomised participants from the remaining 31 trials there were 3904 participants who completed the trials. Not all trials reported on all outcomes, and not all trials reported outcomes in a form suitable for inclusion in the meta-analysis.

There were three open randomised trials (<LINK REF="STD-Penotti-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Penotti 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Raisz-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Raisz 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zang-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Zang 2006</LINK>) and three single-blind trials (<LINK REF="STD-Burger-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Burger 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Davis-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Davis 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dow-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Dow 1983</LINK>).</P>
<P>To ensure double blinding (participants and assessors), one trial used an identical form of medication (<LINK REF="STD-Miller-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 2000</LINK>) where oestrogen and testosterone were combined in a tablet that was identical to the oestrogen tablet; 15 trials used placebo therapy (<LINK REF="STD-Braunstein-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Braunstein 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Buster-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Buster 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Davis-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Davis 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-de-Paula-2007" TYPE="STUDY">de Paula 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-El_x002d_Hage-2007" TYPE="STUDY">El-Hage 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hofling-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Hofling 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Leao-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Leao 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Matthews-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Matthews 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nathrost_x002d_Boos--2006" TYPE="STUDY">Nathrost-Boos 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Penteado-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Penteado 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sherwin-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Sherwin 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shifren-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Shifren 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shifren-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Shifren 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Simon-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Simon 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Warnock-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Warnock 2005</LINK>); six trials used double-dummy placebo tablets (<LINK REF="STD-Floter-2002b" TYPE="STUDY">Floter 2002b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hickok-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Hickok 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lobo-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Lobo 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Regestein-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Regestein 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sarrel-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Sarrel 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Watts-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Watts 1995</LINK>); and two used an independent doctor, who did not assess the outcome, to provide medication (<LINK REF="STD-Farish-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Farish 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Montgomery-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Montgomery 1987</LINK>). Five trials did not report the blinding method (<LINK REF="STD-Barrett_x002d_Connor-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Barrett-Connor 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chiuve-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Chiuve 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dobs-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Dobs 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shepanek-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Shepanek 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Simon-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Simon 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>3.2 Crossover studies<BR/>Seven trials were crossover studies (<LINK REF="STD-de-Paula-2007" TYPE="STUDY">de Paula 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-El_x002d_Hage-2007" TYPE="STUDY">El-Hage 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Floter-2002b" TYPE="STUDY">Floter 2002b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nathrost_x002d_Boos--2006" TYPE="STUDY">Nathrost-Boos 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Regestein-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Regestein 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sherwin-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Sherwin 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shifren-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Shifren 2000</LINK>). The principal problem with this kind of study is an effect or carry over after the treatment crossover. Therefore, a period between treatments, known as a washout period, is needed as a means of minimizing carry over effects. In addition, the statistical techniques to demonstrate absence of carry over may not be satisfactory. Thus only a crossover study that had a washout period was considered as an appropriate trial. Accordingly, for this review, two trials conducted by El-Hage et al and Sherwin et al were recognized as suitable crossover studies (<LINK REF="STD-El_x002d_Hage-2007" TYPE="STUDY">El-Hage 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sherwin-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Sherwin 1988</LINK>). Because of the possibility of a carry-over effect, it was decided that only the first half of the remaining studies would be considered for inclusion. However, after contacting corresponding authors of these studies it was established that the data from the first treatment periods were no longer available.</P>

<P>5. Outcomes<BR/>This review had a broad range of outcomes of interest. Data synthesis in each outcome was from meta-analysis, descriptive analysis, or both depending on the availability and appropriateness of data. The availability of data is presented in this section. For construct outcomes only the available data that were measured by validated questionnaires were subsequently included for data synthesis and considered for meta-analysis. Construct outcomes were sense of well being, unexplained fatigue, sexual function, mood, menopausal symptoms, increased facial and body hair growth, and acne. The available data from parallel studies and the one crossover study with a washout period where the data were non-skewed were included for meta-analysis. Information about data that were not included in the meta-analysis was presented in an additional table of trial outcomes not included in the meta-analysis.</P>

The remaining two studies did not report on discontinuation rate.</P>
<P>Ten trials stated that analyses were performed on an intention-to-treat basis (<LINK REF="STD-Barrett_x002d_Connor-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Barrett-Connor 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Braunstein-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Braunstein 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Buster-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Buster 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Davis-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Davis 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-El_x002d_Hage-2007" TYPE="STUDY">El-Hage 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lobo-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Lobo 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shifren-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Shifren 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shifren-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Shifren 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Simon-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Simon 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Warnock-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Warnock 2005</LINK>). Seven trials clearly described the method of intention-to-treat analysis. The 'last observation carried forward' approach was used for the intention-to-treat analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Braunstein-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Braunstein 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Buster-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Buster 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Davis-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Davis 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shifren-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Shifren 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Simon-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Simon 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lobo-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Lobo 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Warnock-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Warnock 2005</LINK>) however the number of participants analysed was still less than the number of participants randomised. For the other two of the nine trials the number of participants analysed was obviously less than that at randomisation (<LINK REF="STD-Barrett_x002d_Connor-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Barrett-Connor 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shifren-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Shifren 2000</LINK>). There were two criteria for an intention-to-treat analysis. Firstly, trial participants should be analysed in the groups to which they were randomised regardless of which (or how much) treatment they actually received and regardless of other protocol irregularities, such as ineligibility. In addition, all participants should be included regardless of whether their outcomes were actually collected. According to these criteria none of the studies were analysed by a genuine intention-to-treat analysis.</P>
<P>4. Standardized outcome measurement<BR/>Standardized outcome measurement was considered for the construct variables in term of validated scales or questionnaire use.<BR/>4.1 Sense of well being: of all the relevant trials one study used a self-rating scale (<LINK REF="STD-Penotti-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Penotti 2001</LINK>); eight used validated questionnaires (<LINK REF="STD-Dobs-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Dobs 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Floter-2002b" TYPE="STUDY">Floter 2002b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Matthews-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Matthews 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Montgomery-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Montgomery 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Regestein-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Regestein 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sherwin-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Sherwin 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shifren-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Shifren 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Warnock-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Warnock 2005</LINK>), and one did not describe the questionnaire used (<LINK REF="STD-Barrett_x002d_Connor-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Barrett-Connor 1999</LINK>). The names of the validated questionnaires were: the Quality of Life at Menopause Scale (QUALMS), The Menopausal Quality of Life Questionnaire, the Psychological General Well Being Index (PGWB), the short version of Kellner and Sheffield's self rating scale of distress (SRD 30), the Trait Anxiety Inventory, the Zung Self-Rated Depression Inventory, the symptom Check List-90 Revised, the Adult Playfulness Scale, and the Multiple Adjective Affect Checklist (MAACL).<BR/>
<BR/>4.2 Unexplained fatigue: all relevant trials used validated questionnaires (<LINK REF="STD-Floter-2002b" TYPE="STUDY">Floter 2002b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sherwin-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Sherwin 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shifren-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Shifren 2000</LINK>).

<B>Outcomes</B>
</P>
<P>1. <B>Primary outcomes</B>
<BR/>1.1. Sense of well being<BR/>1.1.1. Meta-analysis (comparison 1): two studies were eligible for this analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Matthews-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Matthews 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Warnock-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Warnock 2005</LINK>). There were 10 domains of well being. Of these domains only sexual function was improved by testosterone addition. We reported the improvement with testosterone in terms of the standardized mean difference (SMD). The improvement with testosterone was 0.47 (95% CI 0.15 to 0.80).<BR/>1.1.2. Descriptive data synthesis: of the five available trials that used validated questionnaires there was one crossover study with no washout period that reported a significant benefit to general well being of adding a testosterone patch to an hormone (HT) regimen (<LINK REF="STD-Shifren-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Shifren 2000</LINK>). In contrast, there was no evidence of a significant difference in another crossover study, with no washout period, which examined the effect of adding testosterone undecanoate to HT (<LINK REF="STD-Floter-2002b" TYPE="STUDY">Floter 2002b</LINK>). These two trials measured sense of well being by the Psychological General Well Being Index. For other trials that used other types of questionnaires, one crossover study reported no effect on anxiety with the addition of a testosterone injection (<LINK REF="STD-Sherwin-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Sherwin 1988</LINK>) and there was no evidence of a significant difference for sense of well being from two parallel trials (<LINK REF="STD-Montgomery-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Montgomery 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Regestein-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Regestein 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>1.2. Unexplained fatigue<BR/>1.2.1. Meta-analysis: no appropriate data were available<BR/>1.2.2. Descriptive data synthesis: data were available from three crossover studies in surgically menopausal women (<LINK REF="STD-Floter-2002b" TYPE="STUDY">Floter 2002b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sherwin-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Sherwin 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shifren-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Shifren 2000</LINK>). One crossover study with a washout period found that women treated with oestrogen alone reported significantly lower ratings of energy levels than those who received either of the androgen-containing preparations (P &lt; 0.01) (<LINK REF="STD-Sherwin-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Sherwin 1988</LINK>). Two other studies with no washout period found no significant difference between the treatments in term of vitality (<LINK REF="STD-Floter-2002b" TYPE="STUDY">Floter 2002b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shifren-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Shifren 2000</LINK>). It is possible that lack of a washout period in these studies contributed to underestimation of a treatment effect for this outcome.</P>
<P>1.3. Sexual function<BR/>1.3.1. Meta-analysis (comparison 2): there was an improved outcome with testosterone for a number of domains of sexual function. For one of the domains, the parameters sexual activity and coital frequency were considered together. We reported the improvement with testosterone in terms of the standardized mean difference (SMD). The mean scores were greater in the T-HT group than in the HT alone group. The improvement was 0.29 (95% CI 0.20 to 0.38) for the number of satisfying sexual events, 0.25 (95% CI 0.17 to 0.34) for the total number of sexual events, 0.30 (95% CI 0.21 to 0.39) for the total number of orgasms, 0.35 (95% CI 0.26 to 0.43) for desire, 0.28 (95% CI 0.19 to 0.37) for orgasm, 0.36 (95% CI 0.27 to 0.45) for arousal, 0.33 (95% CI 0.22 to 0.43) for pleasure, 0.32 (95% CI 0.22 to 0.41) for sexual concerns, 0.32 (95% CI 0.23 to 0.40) for responsiveness, 0.26 (95% CI 0.16 to 0.35) for sexual self-image, and 0.41 (95% CI 0.15 to 0.67) for the composite sexual function score. The decrease in mean personal distress scores in the T-HT group was significantly greater than the decrease in the HT group. The difference was -8.13 (95% CI -10.59 to -5.67). One study provided data that showed that use of testosterone was associated with an improved outcome: SMD of 0.98 (95% CI 0.24 to 1.72) for satisfaction, 1.37 (95% CI 0.59 to 2.15) for fantasy, and 0.29 (95% CI 0.20 to 0.38) for frequency of desire.</P>
<P>Subgroup analysis was not practical due to the limited number of studies.<BR/>1.3.2. Descriptive data synthesis: of 14 available studies there were nine trials that used validated questionnaires for assessing sexual function. All of these trials reported positive effects of testosterone on sexual functioning (<LINK REF="STD-Braunstein-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Braunstein 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Davis-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Davis 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dobs-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Dobs 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-El_x002d_Hage-2007" TYPE="STUDY">El-Hage 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Floter-2002b" TYPE="STUDY">Floter 2002b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Penteado-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Penteado 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shepanek-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Shepanek 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sherwin-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Sherwin 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shifren-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Shifren 2000</LINK>). Descriptive data synthesis using other studies that measured sexual function by other scores or scales found inconsistent results.</P>
<P>The majority of trials did not have progestin use as a co-intervention to oppose oestrogenic effects on the endometrium during the study period. However, beneficial effects of testosterone on sexual function were reported when progestin was added (<LINK REF="STD-Burger-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Burger 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Davis-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Davis 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Penteado-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Penteado 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>2. <B>Secondary outcomes</B>
<BR/>2.1. <I>Benefits</I>
<BR/>2.1.1. Bone health: for bone health the best outcome measure is the incidence of osteoporotic fracture; however, no study provided this outcome. The most commonly used outcome to measure bone health was bone mineral density (BMD).<BR/>2.1.1.1. Meta-analysis (comparison 3): meta-analyses using either the mean endpoint or change values from the three eligible trials showed no significant difference between treatment groups for lumbar BMD after 12 and 24 months of treatment. For femoral BMD, there were inconsistent results between analyses using mean endpoint and change values, after 12 months of treatment. By using the mean endpoint, WMD was -0.05 g/cm<SUP>2</SUP> (95% CI -0.09 to -0.01) while for change in value the difference in means was 1.40 g/cm<SUP>2</SUP> (95% CI 0.14 to 2.66). This inconsistency was likely to be due to the effect of the baseline BMD values. The oestrogen plus testosterone group had noticeably lower BMD values at baseline at both sites in two studies, even though in the Miller study the difference in baseline values was not statistically significant (<LINK REF="STD-Davis-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Davis 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Miller-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 2000</LINK>).<BR/>2.1.1.2. Descriptive data synthesis: three studies showed inconsistent results. One study showed that there was no significant difference between treatment groups for BMD of either the lumbar spine or femur (<LINK REF="STD-Watts-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Watts 1995</LINK>). In contrast, another study demonstrated a significantly greater improvement in both lumbar and femoral BMD at 24 months in the testosterone plus hormone therapy (T-HT) group than in the HT group (<LINK REF="STD-Barrett_x002d_Connor-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Barrett-Connor 1999</LINK>). In a study over six months, there were no changes in BMD of the total body, hip, or lumbar spine with either regimen (<LINK REF="STD-Floter-2002b" TYPE="STUDY">Floter 2002b</LINK>).<BR/>
<BR/>
</P>
<P>2.1.2. Body composition<BR/>2.1.2.1. Meta-analysis (comparison 4): data were derived from one or two studies for each parameter. Using mean or mean change, results did not achieve a significant difference for any parameter.<BR/>2.1.2.2. Descriptive data synthesis: results from three studies for other parameters of body composition were not included in the meta-analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Dobs-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Dobs 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Floter-2002b" TYPE="STUDY">Floter 2002b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Leao-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Leao 2006</LINK>). Standard deviations were unclear in one study (<LINK REF="STD-Dobs-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Dobs 2002</LINK>). This study reported that T-HT treatment, when compared with HT alone, significantly increased lean body mass in the arms, legs, and trunk. When the changes in arms, legs, and trunk in each participant were analysed together, the difference between treatments was significant for lean body mass (P &lt; 0.05) and percentage of fat tissue (P &lt; 0.05) but not significant for fat tissue (P &lt; 0.05). In a crossover study, there were no significant differences in total body fat, total lean body mass, trunk fat, and trunk lean mass between the two treatments (<LINK REF="STD-Floter-2002b" TYPE="STUDY">Floter 2002b</LINK>). The addition of testosterone to HT was associated with a significant increase in visceral fat area (P = 0.009) in one study (<LINK REF="STD-Leao-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Leao 2006</LINK>). However, there was no significant difference in subcutaneous fat area between the two groups (<LINK REF="STD-Leao-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Leao 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>2.1.3. Cognition<BR/>2.1.3.1. Meta-analysis (comparison 5): one trial was eligible for meta-analysis for each domain of cognition. These domains were: cognition difficulty (<LINK REF="STD-Warnock-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Warnock 2005</LINK>), identical pictures, and shape memory (<LINK REF="STD-Dobs-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Dobs 2002</LINK>). The results showed no statistically significant difference in the means between treatments (difference in means 0.0, 95% CI -0.21 to 0.21; 2.4, 95% CI -6.67 to 1.87; and 0.10, 95% CI -2.19 to 2.39 for cognition difficulty, identical pictures, and shape memory, respectively) (<LINK REF="STD-Dobs-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Dobs 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Warnock-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Warnock 2005</LINK>).<BR/>2.1.3.2. Descriptive data synthesis: this same study showed that performance on building memory was significantly different between the two groups (<LINK REF="STD-Dobs-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Dobs 2002</LINK>). Women receiving oestrogen and methyltestosterone maintained a steady level of performance on the building memory task, whereas those receiving oestrogen alone showed a decrease in performance. A double-blind, crossover study reported a significant benefit of testosterone on the Switching Attention Test (<LINK REF="STD-Regestein-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Regestein 2001</LINK>). Reaction time in the switching condition was faster in the oestrogen plus testosterone group than in the oestrogen group (t = 3.25, df = 37, P &lt; 0.002, effect size = 0.53 SD) (<LINK REF="STD-Regestein-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Regestein 2001</LINK>). For other conditions of the same test, such as side condition and direction condition, there were no differences between the two groups (<LINK REF="STD-Regestein-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Regestein 2001</LINK>). Results from another double-blind study showed no significant advantage of adding testosterone to oestrogen therapy on tasks involving spatial transformation or orientation, mathematics, or non-verbal reasoning (<LINK REF="STD-Shepanek-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Shepanek 1999</LINK>). Another crossover study did not report an effect on cognitive function of oestrogen alone versus oestrogen plus testosterone (<LINK REF="STD-Sherwin-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Sherwin 1988</LINK>). No studies involved co-administered progestin during the study period.</P>
<P>2.1.4. Menopausal symptoms<BR/>2.1.4.1. Meta-analysis (comparison 6): two trials were eligible for meta-analysis, looking at vasomotor symptoms (<LINK REF="STD-Warnock-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Warnock 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Matthews-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Matthews 2005</LINK>). The results showed no significant difference between the treatment means (mean difference 0,09, 95% CI -0.18 to 0.37). <BR/>2.1.4.2. Descriptive data synthesis: menopausal symptoms were measured by validated questionnaires in three trials (<LINK REF="STD-Dow-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Dow 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Regestein-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Regestein 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sherwin-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Sherwin 1988</LINK>). Dow et al measured menopausal symptoms using a menopausal symptom scale developed by Greene 1976 and reported no significant difference between treatments in any domain. In a crossover trial with no washout period, menopausal symptoms were measured by the Menopause-Specific Quality of Life Questionnaire (MENQOL) and the study found that the mean overall outcome change score between treatments was not different from zero (<LINK REF="STD-Regestein-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Regestein 2001</LINK>). Sherwin et al measured the symptoms using a menopausal index and reported a significantly greater improvement in somatic and psychological symptoms in the combined testosterone-oestrogen treated group than in the oestrogen alone group (<LINK REF="STD-Sherwin-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Sherwin 1988</LINK>). No comparative effects on hot flushes were provided in another report of the same trial (<LINK REF="STD-Sherwin-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Sherwin 1988</LINK>). Descriptive data synthesis from other studies that measured menopausal symptoms using modified scores and scales also found inconsistent results.</P>
<P>2.2. Adverse events<BR/>2.2.1. Increased facial and body hair<BR/>2.2.1.1. Meta-analysis (comparison 7): hirsutism and facial hair growth were considered together. Seven studies that were eligible for meta-analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Braunstein-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Braunstein 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Buster-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Buster 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chiuve-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Chiuve 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Davis-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Davis 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shifren-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Shifren 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Simon-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Simon 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Warnock-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Warnock 2005</LINK>) showed that the incidence of increased facial or body hair growth was significantly higher in the T-HT group than that in the HT group (Peto OR 1.52, 95% CI 1.07 to 2.17). By using a mean hirsutism score, one study eligible for meta-analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Lobo-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Lobo 2003</LINK>) showed that the mean score was not significantly different between the two treatments (difference in means 0.4, 95% CI -0.15 to 0.95).<BR/>2.2.1.2. Descriptive data synthesis: a parallel study reported no differences in the hirsutism scores between the low-dose groups (conjugated equine oestrogen 0.625 mg versus conjugated equine oestrogen 0.625 mg and methyltestosterone 1.25 mg) (<LINK REF="STD-Barrett_x002d_Connor-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Barrett-Connor 1999</LINK>). In the high-dose groups (conjugated equine oestrogen 1.25 mg versus conjugated equine oestrogen 1.25 mg and methyltestosterone 2.5 mg) in the same study, 10 HT-T treated participants and three HT treated participants reported hirsutism as an adverse event. Three crossover studies with no washout period reported no difference in increased hair growth between treatment groups (<LINK REF="STD-El_x002d_Hage-2007" TYPE="STUDY">El-Hage 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Floter-2002b" TYPE="STUDY">Floter 2002b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shifren-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Shifren 2000</LINK>).</P>

Using the mean acne score, one study that was eligible for meta-analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Lobo-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Lobo 2003</LINK>) showed that the score was not significantly different between the two treatments (difference in means 0.1, 95% CI -0.03 to 0.23).<BR/>2.2.2.2. Descriptive data synthesis: the incidence of acne was not different between groups as reported in three crossover studies with no washout period (<LINK REF="STD-El_x002d_Hage-2007" TYPE="STUDY">El-Hage 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Floter-2002b" TYPE="STUDY">Floter 2002b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shifren-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Shifren 2000</LINK>). In the interim analysis of a two-year study (<LINK REF="STD-Barrett_x002d_Connor-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Barrett-Connor 1999</LINK>), acne of mild or moderate severity was reported by 5 (3%) in the oestrogen plus methyltestosterone treated participants whereas no participants receiving oestrogen alone reported acne (<LINK REF="STD-Barrett_x002d_Connor-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Barrett-Connor 1999</LINK>).</P>

Mammographic density (comparison 9): only one trial was eligible for meta-analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Hofling-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Hofling 2007</LINK>). The results showed no statistically significant difference in the mean increase in area of dense breast between the two treatment groups.</P>
<P>2.2.4.2. Incidence of breast cancer: no trial reported an outcome for incidence of breast cancer.<BR/>
<BR/>2.2.5. Coronary heart disease: no trial reported this as an outcome.<BR/>
<BR/>2.2.6. Lipid profile<BR/>2.2.6.1. Meta-analysis (comparison 10 and 11): four lipid parameters were analysed according to route of testosterone administration. As significant heterogeneity was found in the meta-analyses of all lipid parameters, we used the random-effects model to analyse the outcomes. When we combined the results for all routes of testosterone there were significant reductions in total cholesterol and HDL-cholesterol levels while there were significant increases in LDL cholesterol and triglyceride levels. For subgroup analyses according to route of testosterone administration not only did oral testosterone significantly increase LDL cholesterol but it also significantly decreased total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and triglyceride levels. When compared with conventional hormone therapy, the addition of a testosterone patch did not significantly alter the levels of total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and triglyceride but it significantly decreased the HDL level by -1.09 mg/dl (95% CI -1.98 to - 0.91). Possible sources of heterogeneity were clinical and methodological diversities. Baseline inequality was documented in the study conducted by Chiuve et al in terms of triglyceride levels (<LINK REF="STD-Chiuve-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Chiuve 2004</LINK>) and Raisz et al. in terms of age and total cholesterol (<LINK REF="STD-Raisz-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Raisz 1996</LINK>). Baseline triglyceride levels were noticeably lower in the T-HT group than those in the HT group (<LINK REF="STD-Chiuve-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Chiuve 2004</LINK>). Participants in the T-HT group were younger than those in the HT group and baseline total cholesterol levels in the T-HT group were significantly higher than in the HT only group (P &lt; 0.05) (<LINK REF="STD-Raisz-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Raisz 1996</LINK>). Baseline equality was not mentioned in the study conducted by Farish et al (<LINK REF="STD-Farish-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Farish 1984</LINK>). However, baseline lipid levels as shown in a table were similar in both groups (<LINK REF="STD-Farish-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Farish 1984</LINK>).</P>
<P>Five parameters were analysed at five time periods: less than three months, three to &lt; six months, six to &lt; 12 months, at 12 months, and at 24 months. The parameters were: total cholesterol, triglyceride, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and the total cholesterol to HDL cholesterol ratio.</P>
<P>2.2.6.1.1. Studies of less than three-month duration: there were four eligible studies. The direction of the results was different between studies for total cholesterol, triglyceride, and LDL cholesterol. Furthermore, there was statistically significant heterogeneity for triglyceride, HDL cholesterol, and LDL cholesterol (P &lt; 0.05). Therefore these trials were not pooled for triglyceride and LDL cholesterol; a random-effects model was used for the meta-analysis of total cholesterol and HDL cholesterol. Possible sources of heterogeneity were clinical and methodological diversities. Baseline inequality was documented in the study conducted by Chiuve et al in terms of triglyceride levels (<LINK REF="STD-Chiuve-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Chiuve 2004</LINK>) and Raisz et al in terms of age and baseline total cholesterol levels (<LINK REF="STD-Raisz-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Raisz 1996</LINK>). Baseline triglyceride levels were noticeably lower in the T-HT group than in the HT group (<LINK REF="STD-Chiuve-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Chiuve 2004</LINK>). Participants in the T-HT group were younger than those in the HT group and total cholesterol levels in the T-HT group were significantly higher than in the HT-only group (P &lt; 0.05) (<LINK REF="STD-Raisz-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Raisz 1996</LINK>). Baseline equality was not mentioned in the study conducted by Farish et al (<LINK REF="STD-Farish-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Farish 1984</LINK>). However, baseline lipid levels shown in a table were similar in both treatment groups (<LINK REF="STD-Farish-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Farish 1984</LINK>). Another possible source of heterogeneity was the route of hormone administration. In two studies both hormones were administered orally (<LINK REF="STD-Chiuve-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Chiuve 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Raisz-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Raisz 1996</LINK>) and in the other study by implant (<LINK REF="STD-Farish-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Farish 1984</LINK>).</P>
<P>In the meta-analysis: total cholesterol and HDL cholesterol were significantly lower after treatment in the T-HT group than in the HT group. The weighted mean differences (WMD) were -14.92 mg/dl (95% CI -27.81 to -2.03) and -17.11 mg/dl (95% CI -23.47 to -10.75), respectively.<BR/>
<BR/>2.2.6.1.2. Studies over three to &lt; six months: two studies were eligible for this analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Dobs-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Dobs 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lobo-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Lobo 2003</LINK>). Because statistically significant heterogeneity was found using the Chi<SUP>2</SUP> test the random-effects model was used to estimate the treatment effects. A possible source of heterogeneity was the dose of methyltestosterone. In the study conducted by Lobo et al, the dose of methyltestosterone was 1.25 mg (<LINK REF="STD-Lobo-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Lobo 2003</LINK>) while 2.5 mg of methyltestosterone was administered in the study conducted by Dobs et al (<LINK REF="STD-Dobs-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Dobs 2002</LINK>). When we combined the mean scores and the change in scores, triglyceride and HDL cholesterol levels were significantly lower in the T-HT group than in the HT group (total WMD -25.62 mg/dl, 95% CI -38.53 to -12.72; -18.72 mg/dl, 95% CI -26.04 to -11.39 respectively) while total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol levels were not significantly different between treatment groups.</P>
<P>2.2.6.1.3. Studies at six to &lt; 12 months: 10 studies were eligible for this analysis. By using mean scores or change in scores, HDL cholesterol was consistently significantly lower in the T-HT group than in the HT group (WMD -9.38 mg/dl, 95% CI -13.64 to -5.12; -4.74 mg/dl, 95% CI -8.42 to -1.07 respectively) while total cholesterol, triglyceride, and LDL cholesterol levels were not significantly different between treatment groups. Subgroup analysis according to oral or non-oral testosterone (comparison 21) showed that HDL levels consistently decreased in both subgroups; however, the decrease was less in the non-oral subgroup. Only one study was eligible for the meta-analysis of the total cholesterol to HDL cholesterol ratio. For this the decrease in the ratio was greater in the T-HT group than in the HT group (difference in means 20.60, 95% CI 12.76 to 28.44).</P>
<P>2.2.6.1.4. Studies at 12 months: using mean scores or change in scores, only HDL cholesterol was consistently significantly lower in the T-HT group than in the HT group (WMD -7.22 mg/dl, 95% CI -13.99 to -0.45; -23.64 mg/dl, 95% CI -28.95 to -18.33 respectively). However, using change in scores the increase in LDL cholesterol was significantly greater in the T-HT group than in the HT group (WMD 9.5 mg/dl, 95% CI 2.1 to 16.9) whereas the decrease in triglycerides was significantly greater in the T-HT group than in the HT group (WMD -45.29, 95% CI -80.17 to-10.40).</P>
<P>2.2.6.1.5. Studies at 24 months: using mean scores there were no differences between the two treatment groups. However, using change in scores the increase in LDL cholesterol was significantly greater in the T-HT group than in the HT group (WMD 9.8 mg/dl, 95%CI 1.3 to 18.3). Triglyceride and HDL cholesterol levels were significantly lower in the T-HT group than in the HT group (WMD -58.1 mg/dl, 95% CI -76.1 to -40.1; -26.3 mg/dl, 95% CI -30.0 to -22.7 respectively). The total cholesterol to HDL cholesterol ratio was significantly higher in the T-HT group at both 12 and 24 months (WMD 20.8 mg/dl, 95% CI 11.0 to 30.6).</P>
<P>For changes in scores, the meta-analyses at both 12 and 24 months were limited to esterified oestrogen 1.25 mg versus esterified oestrogen 1.25 mg plus methyltestosterone 2.5 mg.</P>
<P>2.2.6.2. Descriptive data synthesis: results from a study of esterified oestrogen 1.25 mg versus esterified oestrogen 1.25 mg plus methyltestosterone 2.5 mg showed that after 16 weeks of treatment significant decreases in the levels of total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and triglycerides occurred in the oestrogen plus testosterone group; LDL cholesterol values were virtually unchanged (<LINK REF="STD-Dobs-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Dobs 2002</LINK>). The oestrogen group demonstrated the opposite effect on lipids with a significant decrease in LDL cholesterol levels and no meaningful change in the other lipid parameters (<LINK REF="STD-Dobs-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Dobs 2002</LINK>). Results from a study of micronized oestrogen (with or without micronized progesterone) versus micronized oestrogen plus micronized testosterone (with or without micronized progesterone) found significant reductions in total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol in all groups (<LINK REF="STD-Miller-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 2000</LINK>). Triglyceride levels increased 26.0% and HDL cholesterol levels decreased 9.0% in the oestrogen plus testosterone group. In contrast, with oestrogen therapy the triglyceride levels decreased 9.0% and HDL cholesterol levels increased 9.0%.</P>
<P>2.2.7. Discontinuation rate<BR/>2.2.7.1. Meta-analysis (comparisons 12, 13, and 14): meta-analyses involving 20 trials showed that there was no statistically significant difference in discontinuation rates between treatments. For the overall discontinuation rate and the discontinuation rate due to adverse events, Peto ORs were 0.99 (95% CI 0.83 to 1.19) and 1.24 (95% CI 0.95 to 1.62), respectively. Sensitivity analyses (comparison 23) based on quality of randomization and concealment of allocation sequences, study size (taking out three large studies with more than 100 participants), blinding, crossover studies, doses of testosterone, and doses of oestrogen did not affect the result. Subgroup analyses on the basis of symptoms at recruitment, menopausal status, type of menopause, duration of treatment, blinding, and disease status did not affect results.</P>
<P>
<B>Sensitivity analysis</B>
</P>
<P>Sensitivity analysis was performed only for the discontinuation rate due to limitations in the number of trials for each outcome. There was no substantial effect of methodological quality of trials, very large studies, length of treatment follow up, and different doses on the discontinuation rate.</P>
<P>
<B>Publication bias</B>
</P>
<P>Funnel plots were created to examine any possibility of publication bias. For the discontinuation rate, the funnel plot had a symmetrical shape around the overall effect with a wide base and a narrow peak. It indicated the absence of bias. However, visual examination of funnel plots for other outcomes had limited power because the numbers of studies were small.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2009-03-18 11:51:02 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="jane clarke">
<P>Based on the results of this review, adding testosterone to an HT regimen has significant beneficial effects on sexual function for several domains, specifically number of satisfying sexual events (SMD 0.29, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.38), the total number of sexual events (SMD 0.25, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.34), number of orgasms (SMD 0.30, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.39), degree of libido or desire (SMD 0.35, 95% CI 0.26 to 0.43), level of orgasm (SMD 0.28, 95% CI 0.19 to 0.37), arousal (SMD 0.36, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.45), pleasure or enjoyment of sex (SMD 0.33, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.43), sexual concerns (SMD 0.32, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.41), responsiveness (SMD 0.32, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.40), sexual self-image (SMD 0.26, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.35), and for the composite sexual function score (SMD 0.41, 95% CI 0.19 to 0.63). The decrease in personal distress scores in the testosterone group at 24 weeks was significantly greater for the placebo group (-8.13, 95% CI -10.59 to -5.67). The clearly documented adverse effects of therapy were a reduction in HDL cholesterol, an increased incidence of facial hair growth (Peto OR 1.52, 95% CI 1.07 to 2.17) and acne (Peto OR 1.52, 95% CI 1.07 to 2.14). A reduction in HDL cholesterol was consistently seen for all testosterone regimens over all study durations that were evaluated. However, the magnitude and precision of this effect varied with the study duration and route of administration. In a subgroup analysis, HDL levels were markedly decreased in postmenopausal women who were treated with oral testosterone (WMD -18.63, 95% CI -22.18 to -15.08) while the effect size was smaller in the women who were treated with a testosterone patch (WMD -1.09, 95% CI -1.98 to -0.91). The discontinuation rate was not significantly greater with testosterone therapy (Peto OR 0.98, 95% CI 0.83 to1.17). There was no convincing evidence for effects on sense of well being, unexplained fatigue, bone health, body composition, menopausal symptoms, cognition, or hostility. However, conclusions are limited by the paucity of studies that have included these outcomes. Evidence for long-term effects on breast cancer and coronary heart disease is lacking.</P>

<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2009-03-18 11:51:06 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="jane clarke">
<P>For applicability of the evidence the following factors should be considered.<BR/>1) Testosterone regimens: all types of testosterone therapy exhibit a beneficial effect on sexual function. An adverse effect on HDL cholesterol levels was seen for testosterone implants, methyltestosterone, and testosterone patches.</P>
<P>2) Characteristics of participants: the improvement in sexual function together with the adverse effect on HDL cholesterol were reported in women treated with HT plus testosterone regardless of the type of menopause, disease status, duration or location of the study. There was no evidence available for perimenopausal women as distinct from postmenopausal women.</P>
<P>3) Biologic and cultural aspects: the age of natural menopause and the experience of menopausal symptoms vary geographically and culturally (<LINK REF="REF-Gold-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gold 2000</LINK>). Additional factors that influence sexual function after menopause include endocrine factors, socioeconomic status, various concurrent illnesses, as well as the availability and sexual vitality of an intimate partner (<LINK REF="REF-Bachmann-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bachmann 2000</LINK>). The effects of exogenous testosterone therapy on sexual function will be superimposed on this complex background.</P>
<P>Because of the complex nature of female sexual dysfunction it is often difficult to establish the meaningful steps in treatment. Treatment options for sexual dysfunction include identification of correctable causes, education and counselling, and medical therapy. Evidence from this systematic review provides information to be considered within the overall management of female sexual dysfunction.</P>

<P>The methodological strengths of the included studies are that most had adequate randomisation and concealment of allocation sequences, to prevent selection bias. Methodological limitations included attrition bias, baseline inequality, the possibility of detection bias, and lack of a washout period in crossover studies. Attrition bias, baseline inequality, and detection bias all may have caused inaccurate effect estimates in the meta-analyses. Attrition bias is evident by a significant number of non-compliers and the lack of an intention-to-treat analysis in most of the included studies. Baseline inequality was documented in the studies that were included in the meta-analysis for sexual function and lipid profile (<LINK REF="STD-Chiuve-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Chiuve 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Davis-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Davis 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Davis-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Davis 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Raisz-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Raisz 1996</LINK>). Detection bias may have occurred in the assessment of sexual function in a single-blind study (<LINK REF="STD-Davis-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Davis 1995</LINK>) and may have resulted in overestimation of the treatment effect. In addition, the baseline inequality that was documented in the studies by Raisz and Chiuve might provide an explanation for the heterogeneity found in the meta-analysis for the lipid outcome with less than three months of treatment. The difference in baseline frequency for total satisfactory activity may have contributed to the inaccurate effect estimate in one of the studies (<LINK REF="STD-Davis-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Davis 2006</LINK>); however, the direction of treatment effect was the same as in the other studies. With respect to the crossover studies included in the descriptive data synthesis for the outcomes of sense of wellbeing, unexplained fatigue, cognition, excess facial and body hair, and acne the lack of a washout period is likely to have resulted in underestimation of a treatment effect. This may have led to inconclusive results in these studies. In addition, different types of questionnaires used for outcome measurements of the construct variables may also have contributed to an underestimation of treatment effect.</P>
<P>Nevertheless, descriptive data synthesis of other double-blind studies that were not included in the meta-analyses confirms a benefit of testosterone therapy on sexual function. The positive effect of testosterone on sexual function and the negative effect on HDL cholesterol levels are likely to be reliable as the direction of the effects is consistent across the relevant studies not included in the meta-analyses.</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2009-03-11 22:36:39 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The strengths of this review are that we looked at a broad range of outcomes in relation to the addition of testosterone to HT regimens and thoroughly searched for all relevant studies, both published and unpublished, in electronic databases. We also made contact with the corresponding authors of relevant articles, experts, and pharmaceutical companies; and relevant journals were handsearched. In addition, there was a pre-determined strategy for study selection and quality assessment of included studies, conducted by two independent assessors. These procedures were used to optimize the validity of the results of this review. Last but not least, we have now included more data in our meta-analyses, specifically on sexual function, lipid profile, excess facial and body hair, and acne, resulting in more precise estimates of efficacy and safety than those in the previous review (Cochrane 2005).</P>
<P>Limitations of this review are the small number of studies and that no study was suitable for meta-analyses for some outcomes, specifically sense of well being, unexplained fatigue, bone health, body composition, cognition, menopausal symptoms, mood alteration, breast cancer, and cardiovascular disease. In addition we included different regimens in the same analysis. The former limitation contributed to the inconclusive results and limited the power of the meta-analysis to provide conclusions about some aspects of efficacy and safety. To address our question on whether there is evidence for the efficacy of testosterone therapy, we included all eligible studies in the meta-analyses regardless of the treatment regimen. The limitation of this approach is that the effect estimate cannot be interpreted for a single treatment regimen.</P>
<P>Progestin was a co-intervention in eight of the included trials. This could potentially obscure the treatment effects of testosterone on sexual function, body composition, BMD, biochemical markers of bone turnover, and lipid profiles. This review did not distinguish adverse events specific to the study medication from other adverse events since there was inconsistent reporting of the classification of adverse events among the studies. We did not review the effects of HT plus testosterone on liver function, endometrial histology, or hormonal profiles.</P>

<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2009-03-18 12:35:08 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="jane clarke">
<P>In support of the effects of testosterone on sexual function, a dose-response relationship between testosterone and sexual function was suggested by six studies (<LINK REF="STD-Braunstein-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Braunstein 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Buster-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Buster 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Davis-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Davis 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shifren-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Shifren 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shifren-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Shifren 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Simon-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Simon 2005</LINK>). The test for a linear dose-response relationship for changes in sexual desire showed a positive trend although it did not reach statistical significance (P = 0.06) (<LINK REF="STD-Braunstein-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Braunstein 2005</LINK>). In the study by Shifren et al higher testosterone doses resulted in further increases in scores for thoughts-desire, frequency of sexual activity, and pleasure-orgasm determined using the Brief Index of Sexual Functioning for women (<LINK REF="STD-Shifren-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Shifren 2000</LINK>). There was no formal statistical analysis for the dose-response relationship provided. Thus a dose-response relationship may exist but the limited number and size of available studies provided us with limited power to assess a dose-response effect. The correlation between testosterone levels and sexual function was supported by evidence from six therapeutic trials (<LINK REF="STD-Braunstein-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Braunstein 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Buster-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Buster 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Davis-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Davis 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lobo-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Lobo 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shifren-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Shifren 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Simon-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Simon 2005</LINK>). Lobo et al reported a significant association between changes in female sexual interest or desire and responsiveness and bioavailable testosterone (<LINK REF="STD-Lobo-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Lobo 2003</LINK>). However, the correlation coefficient was not reported. Braustein et al reported a significant association between testosterone (total, free, and bioavailable) and many domains of sexual function; specifically sexual desire, sexual arousal, orgasm, and pleasure (<LINK REF="STD-Braunstein-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Braunstein 2005</LINK>). Significant correlations were also consistently observed between changes in serum total, bioavailable, and free testosterone levels and changes in the frequency of satisfying activity (Spearman's rank correlation of 0.16 to 0.18; P &lt; 0.05), sexual desire (0.20 to 0.25; P&lt;0.05), and personal distress (-0.11 to -0.17, P &lt; 0.05) (<LINK REF="STD-Buster-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Buster 2005</LINK>). These correlations were consistently reported by other studies using testosterone patches (<LINK REF="STD-Davis-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Davis 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shifren-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Shifren 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Simon-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Simon 2005</LINK>). The magnitude of the correlation coefficient varied across the studies. The highest coefficients were 0.61, 0.40, and 0.48 for the correlation between free testosterone and the frequency of satisfying activity, sexual desire, and personal distress, respectively. These figures showed a moderately strong relationship between serum levels of testosterone and sexual function.</P>
<P>Evidence from therapeutic trials regarding testosterone levels and the change of lipid profile is controversial. In a study of methyltestosterone in surgically postmenopausal women taking esterified oestrogens, changes in serum testosterone, total or free, were not found to be significantly correlated with changes in any of the lipoproteins (<LINK REF="STD-Chiuve-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Chiuve 2004</LINK>). In a crossover study, during the phase of oestradiol valerate 2 mg plus testosterone undecanoate 40 mg the difference between baseline and 24 weeks showed a significant positive correlation between free testosterone and total cholesterol (r = 0.33, P &lt; 0.027). However, no correlations were found between the levels of total testosterone, free testosterone, and serum levels of HDL cholesterol (<LINK REF="STD-Floter-2002b" TYPE="STUDY">Floter 2002b</LINK>).</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2009-03-11 22:49:21 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>1) Based on the evidence provided by our review of published data, an indication for adding testosterone to HT is to enhance sexual function in postmenopausal women. Adding testosterone to HT improved the number of satisfying sexual events (SMD 0.29, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.38), total number of sexual events (SMD 0.25, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.34), number of orgasms (SMD 0.30, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.39), degree of libido or desire (SMD 0.35, 95% CI 0.26 to 0.43), level of orgasm (SMD 0.28, 95% CI 0.19 to 0.37), arousal (SMD 0.36, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.45), pleasure or enjoyment of sex (SMD 0.33, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.43), sexual concerns (SMD 0.32, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.41), responsiveness (SMD 0.32, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.40), sexual self image (SMD 0.26, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.35), and the composite sexual function score (SMD 0.41, 95% CI 0.19 to 0.63). The decrease in personal distress scores in the testosterone group at 24 weeks was significantly greater than the decrease in the placebo group (SMD -8.13, 95% CI 1-0.59 to -5.67). The overall reporting of side effects in the studies included in this review was inadequate. Hence testosterone therapy should be used with caution.</P>
<P>2) Close surveillance for hirsutism, acne, change in HDL cholesterol, and other side effects is necessary. The incidence of hirsutism or facial hair growth and acne are clearly increased by addition of testosterone to hormone therapy (Peto OR 1.52, 95% CI 1.07 to 2.17; Peto OR 1.52, 95% CI 1.07 to 2.14 respectively). Another documented adverse event of adding testosterone to hormone therapy is a significant decrease in HDL cholesterol levels. The changes ranged from -5.84 (95% CI -9.10.13 to -2.58) to -17.63 (95% CI -31.45 to -3.80) at 6 to less than 12 months and 24 months of study, respectively). At this time, testosterone therapy should be limited to short-term use, as long-term studies are not available.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2009-03-11 22:55:53 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>1) Study design for further research into the use of testosterone in women: double-blind, randomised controlled studies will best estimate treatment effects. A crossover study with an adequate washout period to discard any carry-over effect is an alternative.<BR/>2) Type of outcome measurement: the most useful type of data is dichotomous or categorical data. These data convey the number of women who receive a benefit and the number of women who are put at increased risk. Therefore, if possible, further research should measure outcomes as dichotomous or categorical outcomes, such as improved, not improved, or worsened, in addition to continuous outcomes.<BR/>3) Outcome of interest: the following outcomes remain unclear and should be further investigated by appropriate studies.<BR/>3.1. Benefits of testosterone on well being, unexplained fatigue, bone health (bone mineral density and fracture rate), and cognition.<BR/>3.2. Adverse effects on deepening of voice, coagulation profile, haematocrit, and mood changes.<BR/>3.3. Long-term complications: breast cancer, stroke, and coronary heart disease.<BR/>4) Intervention: use of testosterone alone in postmenopausal women may increase with new product availability. However, this cannot be recommended until adequate safety data is available. More studies addressing the use of testosterone with oestrogen versus testosterone alone in postmenopausal women are required.<BR/>5) Co-intervention: the majority of studies in which methyltestosterone was administered did not include co-administration of a progestin, therefore the effects of methyltestosterone plus oestrogen and progestin in naturally menopausal women requires further study.<BR/>6) Target population: effects of testosterone therapy in perimenopausal women needs investigation.<BR/>7) Duration of treatment: although the available evidence suggests a benefit of testosterone on sexual function, the ideal duration of treatment is still unclear.</P>

<P>Differences in task performance between women receiving E or E-T treatment were assessed with a 2-factor(treatment group x test session), mixed analysis of variance for each cognitive task. Post hoc comparisons were conducted using Tukey's method of multiple comparisons. With regard to Cube Comparisons, performance improved for both groups across test sessions, however this improvement only approached statistical significance (P=0.09). No other effects were significant. Regarding Building Memory, a main effect of test session was observed, with performance declining across sessions for both groups(P&lt;0.01). A treatment x test session interaction was observed(P&lt;0.05). Post hoc comparison revealed that this effect was due to a decrease in the E group(P&lt;0.05) but not The E-T group(P&gt;0.1) across sessions.</P>

In the oestrogen-testosterone group, BISF-W mean increases at each visit were statistically significant for frequency/psychosexual(P=0.05) and pleasure/orgasm(P=0.041) domains. The mean composite BISF-W score increased in the oestrogen-testosterone group, whereas the mean score in the estrogen group decreased. Although it appeared that the two treatment groups were not well balanced at baseline(the estrogen group seemed to have healthier sexual function at baseline than the estrogen-testosterone group), the estrogen-testosterone group showed significant improvement in sexual function compared with the estrogen group.<BR/>The SRS total score in the estrogen-testosterone group improved significantly at each visit, whereas scores in the estrogen group did not change significantly. The SIQ score for the estrogen-testosterone group also increased significantly for interest in sex at weeks 10(P=0.031) and 16(P=0.014) when compared with before menopause. The oestrogen group showed no significant change from baseline</P>
