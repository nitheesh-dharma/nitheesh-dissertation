<TITLE MODIFIED="2008-03-26 10:00:08 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">Methadone maintenance at different dosages for opioid dependence</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>People who are addicted to opioids have high risks of receiving an overdose of opioid, HIV, hepatitis B and C infections and criminal activity. This has led to a harm reduction treatment approach to drug addiction. Treatment is aimed at a reduction in these risks and relapses to opioid and polysubstance use and promoting psychosocial adjustment. Methadone maintenance treatment is a long-term opioid replacement therapy that is used to manage opioid dependence, reduce illicit opioid use and promote retention in treatment. Taken by mouth and active over 24 to 36 hours, it is an opioid drug that removes the euphoric effects of heroin and reduces withdrawal symptoms as well as being compatible with normal activities at work or school. The review authors identified 21 controlled trials involving a total of 5994 opioid users. In 11 of these trials, all from the USA, 2279 participants were randomised to methadone treatment at different doses or another treatment (buprenorphine or levomethadyl). Treatment was for between seven and 53 weeks. A further 10 controlled trials did not randomly assign the total of 3715 participants to a treatment. These were from various diverse countries and followed opioid users for one to 10 years. Higher doses of methadone (60 to 100 mg/day) were more effective than lower doses (1 to 39 mg/day) in retaining opioid users in therapy and in reducing illicit use of heroin and cocaine during treatment. Side effects of methadone appeared to be similar at the different doses, in one trial only.<BR/>The organisation and regulation of methadone maintenance treatment varies widely and some countries have explicit guidelines for programme operation. Methadone maintenance treatment involves the prescription of a drug which itself causes dependence. This means that treatment is not naturally aimed at the total recovery of the individual. </P>
</SUMMARY_BODY>
</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) is a long term opiod replacement therapy, effective in the management of opiod dependence. Even if MMT at high dosage is recommended for reducing illicit opioid use and promoting longer retention in treatment, at present day "the organisation and regulation of the methadone maintenance treatment varies widely".</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To evaluate the efficacy of different dosages of MMT in modifying health and social outcomes and in promoting patients' familiar, occupational and relational functioning.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>We searched: <BR/>- MEDLINE (OVID 1966-2001)<BR/>- EMBASE (1988-2001)<BR/>- ERIC (1988-2001)<BR/>- Psychinfo (1947-2001)<BR/>- Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (CCTR) (1947-2001)<BR/>- Register of the Cochrane Drug and Alcohol Group (CDAG) (1947-2001) <BR/>The CDAG search strategy was applied together with a specific MESH strategy. </P>
<P>Further studies were searched through:<BR/> letters to the authors <BR/> check of references.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomised Controlled Trials (RCT) and Controlled Prospective Studies (CPS) evaluating methadone maintenance at different dosages in the management of opioid dependence. Non-randomised trials were included when proper adjustment for confounding factors was performed at the analysis stage.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Data Extraction was performed separately by two reviewers. Discrepancies were resolved by a third reviewer. Quality assessments of the methodology of studies were carried out using CDAG checklist.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>22 studies were excluded. 21 studies were included: 11 were RCTs (2279 participants) and 10 were CPSs (3715 participants).</P>
<P>Outcomes: Retention rate - RCTs: High versus low doses at shorter follow-ups: RR=1.36 [1.13,1.63], and at longer ones: RR=1.62 [0.95,2.77]. <BR/>Opioid use (self reported), times/w - RCTs: high versus low doses WMD= -2.00 [-4.77,0.77] high vs middle doses WMD= -1.89[-3.43, -0.35] <BR/>Opioid abstinence, (urine based) at &gt;3-4 w - RCTs: high versus low ones: RR=1.59 [1.16,2.18] high vs middle doses RR=1.51[0.63,3.61] <BR/>Cocaine abstinence (urine based) at &gt;3-4 w - RCTs: high versus low doses RR=1.81 [1.15,2.85]<BR/>Overdose mortality - CPSs: high dose versus low dose at 6 years follow up: RR=0.29 [0.02-5.34] high dose vs middle dose at 6 years follow up: RR=0.38 [0.02-9.34] middle dose vs low dose at 6 years follow up: RR=0.57 [0.06-5.06]<BR/> </P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>Methadone dosages ranging from 60 to 100 mg/day are more effective than lower dosages in retaining patients and in reducing use of heroin and cocaine during treatment. To find the optimal dose is a clinical ability, but clinician must consider these conclusions in treatment strategies. </P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2008-03-26 10:03:33 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Opioid addiction (see CDAG module's glossary for definition) is currently defined as a "chronic, relapsing disorder" (<LINK REF="REF-Leshner-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leshner 1997</LINK>;<LINK REF="REF-Dole-1967" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dole 1967</LINK>); this definition, in addition to the epidemiological evidence of the drug related risks affecting the addicted population (<LINK REF="REF-Brettle-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brettle 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ward-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ward 1998</LINK>), has promoted the development of the "harm reduction" approach in drug addiction treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Brettle-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brettle 1991</LINK>;<LINK REF="REF-Ward-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ward 1998</LINK>). According to this approach, treatment is aimed to increase time between relapses to heroin, to reduce intensity, frequency and length of the relapse (<LINK REF="REF-Leshner-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leshner 1997</LINK>), cocaine and polysubstance use, overdoses' risk, criminal activity, HIV, HBV and HCV infection, and to promote psychosocial adjustment (<LINK REF="REF-Leshner-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leshner 1997</LINK>;<LINK REF="REF-Ward-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ward 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Farrell-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Farrell 1994</LINK>).</P>
<P>Methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) is a long term opioid replacement therapy, implying the daily administration of methadone, a long acting (24-36 h) opioid drug, and it is the more common opioid replacement therapy in USA, Europe and Australia (<LINK REF="REF-Ward-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ward 1998</LINK>). Methadone as opioid replacement therapy was introduced by Dole and Nyswander in the 1960's (<LINK REF="REF-Dole-1965" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dole 1965</LINK>), as a drug meeting a number of stringent conditions: it "eliminates the euphoric appeal of heroin and the abstinence symptoms", it is "sufficiently free from toxic or dysphoric effects", it is "orally effective, long acting, medically safe, and compatible with normal performance in work and at school" (<LINK REF="REF-Dole-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dole 1991</LINK>). <BR/>Starting from this model, MMT underwent many changes during time from its "popularisation" to the definition of different goals, such as detoxification, by means of a decrease in dosages (<LINK REF="REF-Ward-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ward 1998</LINK>). Even if MMT at high dosage is recognised to be the best therapy in "preventing withdrawal and inducing a sufficient cross-tolerance to heroin, making average street doses non-intoxicating" (<LINK REF="REF-Ward-1994a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ward 1994a</LINK>) and in reducing illicit opioid use and promoting longer retention in treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Ward-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ward 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Farrell-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Farrell 1994</LINK>), at present day "the organisation and regulation of the methadone maintenance treatment varies widely, with explicit guidelines for programme operation in the United States and Australia and a virtual absence of structure and regulation in Britain" (<LINK REF="REF-Farrell-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Farrell 1994</LINK>), except for the very recent publication of the clinical management drug misuse guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-Dep.-of-Health--1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dep. of Health 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>The reason for such variability in the use of methadone is mainly related to the debates that crosses civil society and professional world. First of all, an agreement has not been reached about the goal of the treatment, which reflects at the moment different ideas on the model of the disease. Considering opioid addiction as an "acute disease" and detoxification as the main aim of the treatment, some professionals use MMT just as a preparation for a subsequent detoxification programme. Others consider opioid addiction as a "chronic disease" and the self-perceived well being of the patients as the main outcome, use MMT as long term treatment which allows complete social and personal rehabilitation and prevents the health damages related to drug use (<LINK REF="REF-McLellan-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">McLellan 2000</LINK>). The differences between this two points of view are not limited to ethical or deontological considerations, but involve interpretation of treatment outcomes: for the former a long retention in treatment is a negative outcome, whereas for the latter it is a positive one (<LINK REF="REF-McLellan-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">McLellan 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>The debate concerns not only clinicians but also policy makers, politicians and the general population, for which the maintenance concept is related to the "prescription of a drug which causes dependence", and this idea leads to a sort of defection of the treatment, being not naturally aimed to the total recovery of the subject. <BR/>This disagreement, mostly not scientific, must be taken to a more technical debate about dosage. The findings of most studies agree in indicating high dosage (&gt;60 mg) as the more effective for the outcomes above stated, whereas only a few authors state that low doses are effective as higher to prevent withdrawal (<LINK REF="REF-Wolff-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wolff 1994</LINK>).<BR/>Moreover, a systematic review on methadone maintenance therapy versus no opioid replacement therapy for opioid dependence have been published (<LINK REF="REF-Mattick-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mattick 2003</LINK>), but the issue of differential efficacy of different dosages has not been addressed.</P>
<P>All these reasons suggest a need for metanalytic and unbiased reviews addressing the above mentioned questions, and possibly clarifying which are the more protective dosages of methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) for the health of drug addicted people.</P>

</SEARCH_METHODS>
<DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2008-03-26 10:02:11 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We adopted a four stages process to select studies to be included in the review:</P>
<P>1. Records retrieved from each database were stored on ProCite; titles were pre-screened for relevance excluding the articles not related to the subject under study, by using specific search terms or search expressions.</P>
<P>2. The studies not excluded above were assessed by reading the abstract. The abstract were sifted separately by two reviewers to evaluate relevance and each study was excluded according to the following criteria:<BR/> if it was clearly not focused on opioid dependence<BR/> if it was clearly not focused on methadone at different dosages<BR/> if it was clearly not a RCT, a CCT or a CPS, or anyway a controlled study<BR/> if it clearly did not present results<BR/>A study was excluded when meeting at least one of the above listed criteria.<BR/>In case of disagreement the study was included in the next step.</P>
<P>3. Each potentially relevant study not excluded in the previous steps was obtained and was independently assessed by two reviewers, in order to include it definitely.</P>
<P>4. The assessment of the internal quality of the included studies was done by two reviewers according to the CDAG's check list (<LINK REF="REF-Ferri-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ferri 2003</LINK>). The CDAG's system was used to weight the criteria used to evaluate the studies. For experimental studies (RCTs and CCTs) randomisation, allocation concealment, blinding, losses to follow-up and criteria defined as "others" (baseline comparability of the groups and absence of performance bias) were carefully examined, and a quality score was determined based on fulfilment of these criteria. For prospective studies (CPSs) population base and confounding adjustment, inclusion of all patients in the analysis and criteria defined as "others" (adequate description of the base and of the treatments) were the main characteristics examined to formulate the quality score. A threshold for exclusion was identified.<BR/>Using this system, studies were finally classified in 3 classes according to quality:</P>
<P>A low risk of bias (all criteria met or one criteria partially met)<BR/>B moderate risk of bias (a maximum of two criteria partially met)<BR/>C high risk of bias (three or more criteria partially met or at least one criteria not met)<BR/>Any disagreement has been resolved by a third reviewer.</P>
<P>According to quality, data extraction from included studies and quantitative analysis was performed by two reviewers independently. A standardized checklist was used for data extraction. Disagreement was dealt with by the third reviewer, acting as a mediator.<BR/>The authors of studies which needed integration of results were contacted, and the reference put into the "Awaiting assessment" section. Two of them (<LINK REF="STD-D_x0027_Ippoliti-1998" TYPE="STUDY">D'Ippoliti 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Torrens-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Torrens 1996</LINK>) provided the requested integrations, allowing the inclusion of the data in the metanalysis.<BR/>For Controlled Prospective Studies, which needed a proper adjustment for confounding factors to be included in the review, the absolute number of subjects in the numerator of occurrence measures given by authors in the papers were unadjusted, and only presented RRs were adjusted for confounding. To fill RevMan tables, which need absolute number of subjects of numerator and denominator measures to provide figures, "adjusted numbers" of numerators were then re-calculated as follows: absolute number of subjects in the numerator of the control group were kept fixed and "adjusted numbers" of subjects with the occurrence under study in the treatment group were re-calculated as product of the adjusted RRs by the absolute numbers of the control group. The fictitious adjusted numbers of events in the intervention group so obtained were put in the tables together with the initial number of subjects in the control group to compare the effects among the studies.<BR/>Some CPSs studies did not present data useful for the inclusion in the metanalysis (<LINK REF="STD-Caplehorn-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Caplehorn 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Caplehorn-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Caplehorn 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Caplehorn-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Caplehorn 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gaughwin-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Gaughwin 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gossop-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Gossop 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Maddux-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Maddux 1997</LINK>): they mainly used Cox regression statistical analysis, providing a RR of leaving treatment according to a continue increase in methadone dose. For these studies, data were extracted converting the provided measures in RRs at specific dosages (30 mg, 60 mg, 90 mg/day); they were summarized in the Addictional <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>.</P>
<P>We used the RevMan software for the analysis. RCTs and CPSs were analysed separately.<BR/>For each study finally included the main results were reported in a table, in which methadone use was presented in classes of dosage, in order to pool together arms subjects with similar exposition to methadone. An evaluation by length of follow-up was made for retention rate. To standardized the outcomes measured with time scales, days were converted into weeks. The different withdrawal symptoms point scales were converted into a standardized 75-point scale, in order to make possible comparison among the studies.<BR/>For RCTs, included results were grouped into the following methadone dosages: 1-39 mg/day, 40-59 mg/day; 60-109 mg/day, &gt;110 mg/day.<BR/>For CPSs, because of a slight overlapping among the categories presented in the studies, results were presented for the outcome "leaving treatment" grouped into three broad groups: low dose, middle dose, high dose. In fact, <LINK REF="STD-Del-Rio-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Del Rio 1997</LINK> provided RRs comparing 15-40 mg/day, 45-60 mg/day and 65-110 mg/day; <LINK REF="STD-D_x0027_Ippoliti-1998" TYPE="STUDY">D'Ippoliti 1998</LINK> compared &lt;30 mg/day, 30-59 mg/day and &gt;=60 mg/day; <LINK REF="STD-Torrens-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Torrens 1996</LINK> compared &lt;=80 mg/day and &gt;80 mg/day. For the outcome "mortality" the categories of the only study included (<LINK REF="STD-Van-Ameijden-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Van Ameijden 1999</LINK>) were maintained: 5-55 mg/day, 55-70 mg/day, &gt;75 mg/day.</P>
<P>A standardized effect size was calculated for each study, based on the outcomes reported. Where possible, relative risk and 95% confidence intervals were calculated through a fixed effects model, and for continuous outcomes a weighted mean difference between groups was presented. To assess for statistical heterogeneity, a test of homogeneity was performed.</P>
<P>In order to assess the effect of the low quality studies on the synthetic results, all included studies were submitted to a sensitivity analysis, either including or excluding the class C ones.</P>
<P>Results were integrated from the meta-analytic review into a discussion taking into account other relevant publications. Convergence between the meta-analysis results and the narrative review was taken to indicate strong evidence of the effect.</P>

<P>Twenty-two studies were excluded from the review.<BR/>Three were RCTs; the study by Havassy (<LINK REF="STD-Havassy-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Havassy 1984</LINK>) was excluded because the randomisation process failed, and there was inadequate control of confounding variables to use it as a CCT. The study by Panell (<LINK REF="STD-Panell-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Panell 1977</LINK>) and the study by Strain (<LINK REF="STD-Strain-1993b" TYPE="STUDY">Strain 1993b</LINK>) presented secondary analysis of subsamples of the original trials (<LINK REF="STD-Ling-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Ling 1996</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Strain-1993a" TYPE="STUDY">Strain 1993a</LINK>), included in the review. In the study by Saxon (<LINK REF="STD-Saxon-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Saxon 1996</LINK>), the comparison was made between contingency and non-contingency approaches and not between doses.<BR/>All the other excluded studies were CPSs; they were mainly excluded because of inadequate control of confounding variables, except for the studies by Caplehorn (<LINK REF="STD-Caplehorn-1993a" TYPE="STUDY">Caplehorn 1993a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Caplehorn-1993b" TYPE="STUDY">Caplehorn 1993b</LINK>) which presented a secondary analysis of the original study (<LINK REF="STD-Caplehorn-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Caplehorn 1991</LINK>), included in the review. The study by Hartel (<LINK REF="STD-Hartel-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Hartel 1998</LINK>) used a retrospective ascertainment of the exposure; Langendam (<LINK REF="STD-Langendam-2000a" TYPE="STUDY">Langendam 2000a</LINK>) did not evaluate the effect of methadone dosage in the multivariate analysis, whilst the study by Stine (<LINK REF="STD-Stine-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Stine 1992</LINK>) evaluated the effects of different contingency approaches and not of methadone dosages.</P>

<P>Among RCTs, five studies compared buprenorphine and methadone treatment, and at least two arms had different methadone dosages with 643 subjects involved (<LINK REF="STD-Johnson-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Johnson 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kosten_x002d_Oliveto-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Kosten-Oliveto 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ling-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Ling 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schottenfeld-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Schottenfeld 1997</LINK>). One study compared levomethadyl acetate and two different methadone dosages with 430 subjects involved (<LINK REF="STD-Ling-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Ling 1976</LINK> ), and one study compared levomethadyl acetate, buprenorphine and two different methadone dosages with 220 subjects involved (<LINK REF="STD-Johnson-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Johnson 2000</LINK>). Three studies with 559 subjects involved (<LINK REF="STD-Goldstein-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Goldstein 1973</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Strain-1993a" TYPE="STUDY">Strain 1993a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Strain-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Strain 1999</LINK>) were focused on the comparison of different dosages of methadone. In the study by Rhoades, 142 subjects involved (<LINK REF="STD-Rhoades-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Rhoades 1998</LINK>), subjects were randomly assigned to two methadone dosages and to two or five visit per week, no results were however useful for the inclusion in the metanalysis. The remaining study (<LINK REF="STD-Preston-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Preston 2000</LINK>) evaluated interventions based on contingent vouchers, and two methadone dosages, combined in different ways: for our analysis we used the groups which received non-contingent vouchers, which involve 285 subjects.</P>

<LI>Outcomes</LI>
</UL>
<P>All included studies were assessed to determine whether they provided data for the outcomes measure of interest, including retention in treatment, heroin and cocaine use by urinalysis, self-reported heroin and cocaine use, long-term abstinence, withdrawal symptoms, amount of drug used per day, criminal activity, HIV, HBV and HCV sero-conversions, overdose and all-causes mortality. After reviewing the studies, it was realized that it was not possible to include urine results for heroin and cocaine use when these were not reported at an individual level; most part of the studies provided in fact proportions of positive tests calculated as the number of positive tests divided by the total of number of tests carried out, and using tests instead of subjects as a unit of analysis: this procedure violates the hypothesis of independence among observations (<LINK REF="REF-Ferri-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ferri 2003</LINK>). Only two studies, showing results at an individual level (percent of patients abstinent), could be included in the metanalysis (<LINK REF="STD-Johnson-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Johnson 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schottenfeld-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Schottenfeld 1997</LINK>). Authors will be contacted in order to provide urine data at a individual level.<BR/>Among CPSs, three studies (<LINK REF="STD-D_x0027_Ippoliti-1998" TYPE="STUDY">D'Ippoliti 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Del-Rio-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Del Rio 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Torrens-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Torrens 1996</LINK>) were focused on risk of leaving treatment as outcome, whilst one study evaluated the effect of dosages on mortality rate (<LINK REF="STD-Van-Ameijden-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Van Ameijden 1999</LINK>).</P>

<P>RCTs</P>
<P>Of the eleven RCTs included in this review, nine were conducted under double blind conditions (<LINK REF="STD-Johnson-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Johnson 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Johnson-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Johnson 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kosten_x002d_Oliveto-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Kosten-Oliveto 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ling-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Ling 1976</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ling-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Ling 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Preston-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Preston 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schottenfeld-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Schottenfeld 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Strain-1993a" TYPE="STUDY">Strain 1993a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Strain-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Strain 1999</LINK>), and two under single blind conditions (<LINK REF="STD-Goldstein-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Goldstein 1973</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rhoades-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Rhoades 1998</LINK>). In order to maintain the double-blind approach, it was generally used a double-dummy procedure: for example, comparing methadone with buprenorphine, patients were given both an oral solution and a sublingual preparation. </P>
<P>Only one of the eleven studies (<LINK REF="STD-Strain-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Strain 1999</LINK>) described in detail a method of allocation concealment, which was adequate: assignments were sealed in numbered envelopes, and dose codes were entered into a database accessible only to pharmacy staff and selected research assistants with no patients contact. All the other studies did not describe allocation concealment procedures in sufficient detail to be clear that the allocation concealment method was adequate. There were no trials where the concealment method could be defined as clearly inadequate. </P>
<P>Five of the eleven studies described the randomisation process (<LINK REF="STD-Strain-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Strain 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schottenfeld-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Schottenfeld 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Preston-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Preston 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ling-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Ling 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Johnson-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Johnson 2000</LINK>); all the others mentioned it without any description. </P>
<P>The characteristics of the patients and the inclusion and exclusion criteria were generally well defined in all the studies. Similarity of the treatment groups at the start of the trial was generally good, except for two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Rhoades-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Rhoades 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Johnson-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Johnson 1992</LINK>).<BR/>The completion of the follow-ups was generally quite high, or it was used an intention to treat analysis. The number of participants varied between 116 subjects (<LINK REF="STD-Schottenfeld-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Schottenfeld 1997</LINK>) up to 430 subjects (<LINK REF="STD-Ling-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Ling 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>According to these criteria, five RCTs (<LINK REF="STD-Strain-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Strain 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schottenfeld-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Schottenfeld 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Preston-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Preston 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ling-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Ling 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Johnson-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Johnson 2000</LINK>) were evaluated as high quality studies (class A), five (<LINK REF="STD-Goldstein-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Goldstein 1973</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ling-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Ling 1976</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kosten_x002d_Oliveto-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Kosten-Oliveto 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Strain-1993a" TYPE="STUDY">Strain 1993a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Johnson-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Johnson 1992</LINK>) as moderate quality studies (class B), and one (<LINK REF="STD-Rhoades-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Rhoades 1998</LINK>) as low quality study (class C). To perform sensitivity analysis it was considered in this case not necessary, because the low quality class study did not provide useful data for the tables, and all the other studies had high or moderate quality.</P>
<P>CPSs</P>
<P>Of ten CPSs included in this review, four provided data on retention by classes of methadone dosage (<LINK REF="STD-D_x0027_Ippoliti-1998" TYPE="STUDY">D'Ippoliti 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Del-Rio-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Del Rio 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Torrens-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Torrens 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Van-Ameijden-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Van Ameijden 1999</LINK>), whilst, as mentioned in the Methods section, six provided a measure of risk according to a continuous increase of methadone dose. All the studies provided an adequate description of the population base, clear inclusion and exclusion criteria. The number of participants varied between 111 (<LINK REF="STD-Del-Rio-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Del Rio 1997</LINK>) up to 721 (<LINK REF="STD-D_x0027_Ippoliti-1998" TYPE="STUDY">D'Ippoliti 1998</LINK>). <BR/> <BR/>For outcomes such as retention or leaving treatment, it was not proper to evaluate losses to follow-up as a criteria to discriminate high and low quality studies. The adjustment for confounding variables was the main criteria used to judge the quality of the CPS studies. Because of poor adjustment, two of them (<LINK REF="STD-Del-Rio-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Del Rio 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gossop-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Gossop 2001</LINK>) were classified as low quality studies (class C), whilst all the others were judged as moderate quality studies (class B). It was in fact impossible to exclude residual confounding. Sensitivity analysis was performed in order to evaluate the effect of low quality studies on the main outcome (treatment retention). Keeping the low quality study in the review did not significantly change the results, so it were kept on. </P>

<P>Retention rates<BR/>As presented in the Methods section, 22 arms of 10 Randomised controlled trials has been classified, according to the used range of dose, in 4 groups of exposure: 1-39 mg/day, 40-59 mg/day, 60-109 mg-day and 110+ mg/day. These four arms were stratified in 2 different follow-up periods. absolute values of retention rates ranged from 20% (low dose, medium follow-up; <LINK REF="STD-Johnson-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Johnson 1992</LINK>) to 96% (medium dose, short follow-up; <LINK REF="STD-Ling-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Ling 1976</LINK>).<BR/>High doses, ranging from 60 to 109 mg/day, showed better retention rates than low doses (1-39 mg/day) both in shorter follow-ups (RR=1.36 [1.13,1.63]) (five studies, 247 patients in the treatment arm and 249 patients in the control one, <LINK REF="STD-Johnson-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Johnson 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Johnson-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Johnson 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kosten_x002d_Oliveto-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Kosten-Oliveto 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ling-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Ling 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schottenfeld-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Schottenfeld 1997</LINK>), and in longer ones (RR=1.62[0.95,2.77]) (one study, 75 patients in the treatment arm, <LINK REF="STD-Ling-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Ling 1996</LINK>).

For studies presented in the additional <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>, RR of leaving treatment at different times from starting varies from 0.56 to 0.40 for medium doses treatments compared to low doses, and from 0 to 0.28 for high doses compared to low doses (all comparisons are statistically significant). The study of <LINK REF="STD-Maddux-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Maddux 1997</LINK> considered the risk of retention instead of the probability of leaving; higher doses treatments show a statistically significant RR of 2.32 to be retained at 1 year, when compared to low doses maintenance. Medium dose vs low dose show a statistically significant RR of 1.66 at 1 year follow-up.</P>

Two studies used the frequency of abstinence period longer than 3 weeks, based on urine analysis, and the pooled results showed that high dose increase the probability to stay abstinent from cocaine, compared with low dose (RR=1.81 [1.15,2.85]) (<LINK REF="STD-Johnson-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Johnson 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schottenfeld-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Schottenfeld 1997</LINK>, 83 patients in the treatment arm, 85 controls).

</INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>This review is based on 11 RCTs and on 10 CPSs, included after a careful assessment of scientific validity. Its main result is that methadone maintenance is a dose-dependent treatment. The higher doses of methadone are associated with better retention in treatment, less heroin use during treatment and lower withdrawal symptoms, until around 100 mg/day, after that the reliability of evidence is lower. The effect of dose on risk of death and on criminal activities can not be reliably assessed because the only study addressing these objectives have not sufficient power to obtain significant results. The probability to stay abstinent from cocaine is higher with high doses of methadone, compared with low doses. No side effects are evident from studies. No more socially relevant outcomes nor infectious diseases risks has been searched by the studies included in the review.</P>
<P>The effectiveness of higher doses of methadone in promoting retention, reducing heroin and promote abstinence from cocaine is consistent within included studies and with pharmacokinetic observations (<LINK REF="REF-Ward-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ward 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hiltunen-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hiltunen 1999</LINK>). The excess of cocaine use in treatment with higher doses reported by Oliveto (<LINK REF="STD-Kosten_x002d_Oliveto-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Kosten-Oliveto 1993</LINK>) can be an effect of chance. Cocaine can be used by methadone maintained patients for different reasons, including antagonism of opioid sedative effects, searching for euphoria independent from methadone "blockade" and to suppress opioid withdrawal. The risk of increasing use of cocaine during methadone maintenance treatment reported by some authors (<LINK REF="REF-Tennant-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tennant 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stine-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stine 1991</LINK>)can be an effect of the underdosing of methadone and higher doses of this medicament should stop use, as showed by this review. Nevertheless the risk of cocaine use in methadone maintenance can be taken carefully into consideration in the choice of patient treatment given that non effective treatments are available nowadays to contrast cocaine use (<LINK REF="REF-Lima-2003a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lima 2003a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lima-2003b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lima 2003b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Soares-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Soares 2003</LINK>). </P>
<P>The use of higher doses of methadone for the aim of retain patients and stop their use of heroin seems to be effective; however the professional community showed some resistance in accepting such a treatment modality (<LINK REF="REF-D_x0027_Aunno-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">D'Aunno 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Farrell-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Farrell 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Baillie-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baillie 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ward-1994b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ward 1994b</LINK>). This is to a certain extent driven by ideological assumption about the nature of opioid addiction (<LINK REF="REF-Rawson-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rawson 1991</LINK>), but partly is due to the management of the treatment by the staff: in general the patient and the staff determine together methadone dosages (<LINK REF="REF-Langendam-2000b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Langendam 2000b</LINK>), and sometimes the patient asks for lower doses, sufficient to contrast withdrawal symptoms but not to neutralise heroin euphoric effects. The availability of systematic reviews on evidence of effectiveness may contribute to the implementation of higher doses treatments.</P>
<P>The low number of studies aimed at studying the influence of methadone dosage in mortality is not surprising; although death is the outcome that can better act as a global indicator of success of treatment, nevertheless death is fortunately a seldom event, even in a high risk population like drug users, and to reach the needed statistical power to study mortality requires big RCTs or long follow-up periods. Observational studies appears to be less complex to carry out for the assessment of the relationship between treatment and mortality, as the study included in our review (<LINK REF="STD-Van-Ameijden-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Van Ameijden 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>This review takes into consideration observational studies together of randomised trials. All studies have been critically appraised using the Cochrane Drug and Alcohol Group methodology (<LINK REF="REF-Ferri-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ferri 2003</LINK>), and randomised and observational studies have been analysed separately, to avoid bias. In conclusion of the review, we can affirm that observational studies showed results which are consistent with those from randomised studies, and they add a relevant outcome not assumed by RCTs, the risk of death.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>The results of the review support the conclusion that methadone dosages ranging from 60 to 100 mg/day are more effective than lower dosages in retaining patients and in reducing use of heroin and cocaine during treatment. To find the optimal dose is a clinical ability, but clinician must consider these conclusions in treatment strategies. The most important side effect is the risk of increase the use of cocaine, which therefore needs to be carefully surveyed by clinicians.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>The main implications for research concern open questions and methodological errors of studies.</P>
<P>There are many questions that remain without answer: <BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>there are some major outcomes for which data are absent or unsatisfactory: the effect of methadone dose in mortality reduction is the most important one. In general social outcomes are seldom addressed by researchers, and we do not have reliable answer to the question if there is the same dose-response relationship, as found for retention and use of heroin, for criminality or social adjustment;</LI>
<LI>cocaine use during methadone maintenance is a major problem, and no effective medication is available; further research on effective treatments is needed, either pharmacological or not;</LI>
<LI>both higher dosages and psycho-social interventions associated to methadone are able to improve outcomes, but the interaction between these two treatments modalities is unknown;</LI>
<LI>one of the open questions is if different characteristics of patients can determine different needs as regards methadone effective doses. Some authors suggest that patients with less severe dependence can be successfully treated with doses lower than 50mg per day (<LINK REF="REF-Ward-1994b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ward 1994b</LINK>), but no studies addressed at the moment such a question.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<BR/>On the methodological point of view, main problems which should be avoided in further research on methadone dosages are:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>the heterogeneity of outcome indicators: to aid comparison between studies, which is the main objective of the science, and to simplify synthesis of results, each author should make effort to adopt both outcome indicators and categorisation of outcomes already adopted by other studies. The editors of scientific journal, scientific societies and all the scientific community, should promote the use of standards in reporting results (<LINK REF="REF-CONSORT-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">CONSORT 2001</LINK>); </LI>
<LI>the control of confounding remain the major methodological reason for the exclusion of observational studies. Given that non-randomised trials are essential to study rare outcomes, such as mortality, and to address questions on effectiveness of treatments, researchers should play a major effort to improve the study design particularly in confounding adjustment.</LI>

</CHAR_PARTICIPANTS>
<CHAR_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>Methadone maintenance at different dosages. The physician tended to regulate the dose according to needs expressed by patients. The starting dose was 30 mg, increased by 10 mg daily until the stabilization dose. Till the 3rd month continued heroin use led to dose increase, after the 3rd month it led to program probation with the requirement of negative urine test for 3 months. A positive test then led to involuntary withdrawal and discharge.</P>
