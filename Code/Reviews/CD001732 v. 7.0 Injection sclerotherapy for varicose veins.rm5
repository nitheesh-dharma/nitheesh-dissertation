<SUMMARY>
<TITLE>Injection sclerotherapy for varicose veins</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Varicose veins are enlarged, visibly lumpy knotted veins, usually in the legs. They can cause pain, burning discomfort, aching and itching as well as generalised aching, heaviness or swelling in the legs, cramps at night and restless leg syndrome. There is also little correlation between these symptoms and the extent or size of the varicose veins which, like minor venous abnormalities thread veins or venous flares, can be cosmetically unattractive. Wearing graduated compression stockings is one treatment option.</P>
<P>Injection sclerotherapy can be used for superficial varicose veins, residual or recurring varicose veins following surgery and thread veins to obliterate the varicose vein. An irritant liquid such as sodium tetradecyl sulphate (STD) is injected into the faulty blood vessel. Pressure pad dressings at the injection site and compression bandages may then be applied, options including crepe bandaging, proprietary elastic bandaging or compression stockings. Bandaging can cause discomfort and foot swelling and may slip. Possible complications of sclerotherapy include formation of blood clots, skin staining, inflammation, ulcers and tissue damage and reactions to the sclerosing agent.<BR/> <BR/>Seventeen randomised controlled trials involving over 3,300 people were included in the review. One study comparing sclerotherapy to compression stockings in pregnancy found that sclerotherapy improved symptoms and cosmetic appearance. There was no overall benefit from using alternative agents to STD (four trials), or any evidence that a foam is superior to liquid (two trials). Adding local anaesthetic to the sclerosing agent did reduce the pain of injection in one study. Neither the type, nor duration of elastic compression (seven studies) or type of pressure pad (one study) after sclerotherapy had any clear effect on the effectiveness of sclerotherapy, on varicose vein recurrence rates, cosmetic appearance or symptomatic improvement, or on complications. Many of the included studies took place in the 1980s and there is very limited evidence on which to assess the merits of sclerotherapy for treatment of varicose veins or comparing graduated compression stockings to sclerotherapy. There were no controlled trials comparing sclerotherapy for thread veins with either laser treatment or simple observation; hypertonic dextrose had similar efficacy in terms of sclerosis to STD in one study. </P>

<ABSTRACT MODIFIED="2008-10-17 13:58:23 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Injection sclerotherapy is widely used for superficial varicose veins. The treatment aims to obliterate the lumen of varicose veins or thread veins. There is limited evidence regarding its efficacy.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To determine whether sclerotherapy is effective in improving symptoms and cosmetic appearance and has an acceptable complication rate; to define rates of symptomatic or cosmetic varicose vein recurrence following sclerotherapy.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2008-10-17 13:58:23 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The Cochrane Peripheral Vascular Diseases Group searched their Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (<I>The Cochrane Library,</I> Issue 4, 2006), MEDLINE and EMBASE (both inception to October 2006) and reference lists of articles. Manufacturers of sclerosants were contacted for additional trial information.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of injection sclerotherapy versus graduated compression stockings (GCS) or 'observation', or comparing different sclerosants, doses, formulations and post-compression bandaging techniques on people with symptomatic and/or cosmetic varicose veins or thread veins were considered for inclusion in the review.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Data were extracted by authors and Review Group Co-ordinators independently.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Seventeen studies were included. One study comparing sclerotherapy to GCS in pregnancy found that sclerotherapy improved symptoms and cosmetic appearance. Three studies comparing sodium tetradecyl sulphate (STD) to alternative sclerosants found no significant differences in outcome or complication rates; another study found that sclerotherapy with STD led to improved cosmetic appearance compared with polidocanol, although there was no difference in symptoms. Sclerosant plus local anaesthetic reduced the pain from injection (one study) but had no other effects. Two studies compared foam- to conventional sclerotherapy; one found no difference in failure rate or recurrent varicose veins; a second showed short-term benefit from foam in terms of elimination of venous reflux. The recanalisation rate was no different between the two treatments. One study comparing Molefoam and Sorbo pad pressure dressings found no difference in erythema or successful sclerosis. The degree and duration of elastic compression had no significant effect on varicose vein recurrence rates, cosmetic appearance or symptomatic improvement.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>Evidence from RCTs suggests that the choice of sclerosant, dose, formulation (foam versus liquid), local pressure dressing, degree and length of compression have no significant effect on the efficacy of sclerotherapy for varicose veins. The evidence supports the current place of sclerotherapy in modern clinical practice, which is usually limited to treatment of recurrent varicose veins following surgery and thread veins. Surgery versus sclerotherapy is the subject of a further Cochrane Review.</P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2008-10-17 16:29:30 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Varicose veins are a common finding with a point prevalence of 20 to 25% in females and 10 to 15% in males over the age of 15 years (<LINK REF="REF-Callam-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Callam 1994</LINK>). It is difficult to find a satisfactory definition of varicose veins upon which consensus has been reached. Minor venous abnormalities such as thread veins are also seen in up to 50 to 55% of women and 40 to 50% of men. <LINK REF="REF-Brand-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brand 1998</LINK> suggests that 2.6% of women and 2.0% of men will develop varicose veins over a two-year period (<LINK REF="REF-Brand-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brand 1998</LINK>). </P>
<P>The symptoms attributable to varicose veins, and their correlation with the extent of venous reflux, are not clearly defined. Epidemiological evidence suggests that even in the presence of 'main stem' varicose veins, most lower limb symptoms have a non-venous cause (<LINK REF="REF-Bradbury-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bradbury 1999</LINK>). The Edinburgh Vein Study has demonstrated superficial venous reflux in 9% of randomly selected men and 15% of women as well as deep venous reflux in 22% of men and 11% of women (<LINK REF="REF-Allan-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Allan 2000</LINK>). Subjects with visible truncal varicosities have a higher incidence of reflux on Duplex ultrasound, although in many cases of documented reflux there are no visible varicose veins. There is also little correlation between symptoms of varicose veins and their extent or size on examination. Commonly reported symptoms include local discomfort over varicosities (pain, burning discomfort, aching and itching), generalised lower limb symptoms (aching, heaviness, swelling and restless leg syndrome) and nocturnal cramps, as well as complaints about cosmetic appearance. </P>
<P>Swelling and night cramps are commonly reported symptoms of varicose veins in pregnancy; a recent Cochrane Review from the <I>Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews</I> has evaluated the treatment options for pregnant women (<LINK REF="REF-Young-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Young 1998</LINK>). The majority of outcome measures, following treatment of varicose veins, are assessed subjectively, i.e. symptomatic improvement, cosmetic appearance and quality of life measures. Outcomes that can be assessed objectively include varicose vein recurrence and complication rates.</P>
<P>Surgery is commonly used to treat 'main stem' varicose veins. Sclerotherapy has been used to treat varicose veins from as early as 1835 according to records from Massachusetts General Hospital. Chassaignac, who published a series of cases from 1853 injected zinc chloride into varicose veins (<LINK REF="REF-Chassaignac-1855" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chassaignac 1855</LINK>). Hobbs gave a historical overview on the use of sclerotherapy and compression bandaging in the early part of the 20th century, starting in Paris with Linser (1911) and Sicard (1911) (<LINK REF="STD-Hobbs-1968" TYPE="STUDY">Hobbs 1968</LINK>). However, it was not until 1963 that the technique of sclerotherapy was described and popularised by Fegan, whose name has become synonymous with the procedure (<LINK REF="REF-Fegan-1963" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fegan 1963</LINK>). Vascular surgeons have adopted sclerotherapy with varying levels of enthusiasm and with differing indications. A survey on behalf of the Vascular Surgical Society of Great Britain and country-regionplaceIreland showed that most surgeons reserved sclerotherapy for either primary varicose veins in the absence of superficial venous incompetence (69.7%) or residual varicose veins following surgery (77.1%) (<LINK REF="REF-Galland-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Galland 1998</LINK>).</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>The main aims of the review were to determine whether injection sclerotherapy is effective for treating varicose veins in terms of symptomatic improvement and cosmetic appearance, whether sclerotherapy has an acceptable complication rate, and to define the rate of symptomatic or cosmetic recurrence following sclerotherapy.</P>

<SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<CRIT_STUDIES>
<P>Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of injection sclerotherapy versus graduated compression stockings or 'observation' were considered for inclusion in the review. RCTs comparing sclerotherapy to surgery are the subject of a further Cochrane review and thus are not included in this review. All RCTs comparing different sclerosants, sclerosant doses, different formulations of sclerosants and post-compression bandaging techniques were also included.</P>
</CRIT_STUDIES>
<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>All people over 15 years of age referred to a surgical outpatient clinic or primary care practitioner with symptomatic or cosmetic varicose veins. Children presenting with varicose veins and people with venous ulcers and deep venous insufficiency were excluded from the analyses. Participants were potentially divided into three groups:</P>
<P>1. Those with superficial venous incompetence demonstrated on hand-held Doppler or Duplex ultrasound scanning, i.e. long saphenous vein (medial thigh vein), short saphenous vein (posterior calf vein) and calf vein perforators (veins connecting superficial and deep venous systems).</P>
<P>2. Those with varicosities with no evidence of superficial venous incompetence.</P>
<P>3. Those with thread veins (venous flares/hyphen-webs).</P>
</CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>1. Sclerotherapy versus other treatment options:<BR/>a) Sclerotherapy versus graduated compression stockings for varicose veins with superficial venous incompetence.<BR/>b) Sclerotherapy versus graduated compression stockings or observation for varicose veins in the absence of superficial venous incompetence.<BR/>c) Sclerotherapy versus laser treatment or no treatment (i.e. simple follow-up) in people with thread veins.</P>
<P>2. Comparison of different sclerosants (e.g. sodium tetradecyl sulphate (STD), ethanolamine, polidocanol (Sclerovein, aetoxysclerol, aethoxysklerol, aethoxysclerol, atoxisclerol, Sotrauerix, Laureth 9), chrome alum (Scleremo), hypertonic saline, sclerosant dose (e.g. STD 0.2%, 0.5%, 1%, 3%) and sclerosant formulation (liquid, foam).</P>
<P>3. Comparison of injection techniques, bandaging and compression techniques and repeat treatment intervals.</P>

<P>The Cochrane Peripheral Vascular Diseases Group (PVD) searched their Specialised Register (last searched October 2006) and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in <I>The Cochrane Library</I> (last searched Issue 4, 2006) for RCTs of injection sclerotherapy for treatment of varicose veins (excluding comparisons with surgery).

The authors searched MEDLINE and EMBASE (both inception to October 2006) and bibiographies of relevant trials were also examined to identify any further RCTs. </P>
<P>Pharmaceutical manufacturers of sclerosants were contacted to determine whether any further trial information was available. There were no restrictions on language.</P>
</SEARCH_METHODS>
<DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>
<B>Selection of trials</B>
<BR/>Trials identified from the computerised literature search were selected for possible inclusion in the study by the first author (PVT). It was anticipated that additional information, if required, could be sought from the relevant authors. In most cases this was historical data (1970s to 1980s) and therefore no attempt was made to obtain further information.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of trials</B>
<BR/>Potentially eligible trials were assessed by the authors independently to determine the relevance of each study. Ideally, studies should have sufficient statistical power to detect a difference between treatment groups. Trials were accepted only if the authors agreed that the inclusion criteria had been met. Disagreements were resolved by discussion. Trials were scrutinised for allocation concealment, ensuring that a participant of the trial did not influence the randomisation process.</P>
<P>Blinding is not possible in studies comparing sclerotherapy to other treatment options. However, RCTs comparing different sclerosants should be blinded for both the patient and clinician.</P>
<P>Trials were scrutinised to ascertain whether follow-up was explicitly reported or implied in order to avoid attrition bias. Missing follow-up data were not sought from the original investigators (<I>see </I>Selection of trials). </P>
<P>The quality of included trials was assessed by PVT and agreed by CB using a simple standard checklist developed by the Cochrane Peripheral Vascular Diseases Review Group.</P>
<P>
<B>Data extraction</B>
<BR/>Data from trials were extracted by PVT, CB, and the Cochrane PVD Review Group Co-ordinators independently and were then cross-checked for agreement. </P>
<P>
<B>Statistical analysis</B>
<BR/>Heterogeneity of the results from different studies for each comparison of outcome variables was assessed using RevMan Analyses 1.0.2 statistical software, as well as by clinical judgement. However, the comparatively low number of trials included in the review meant that the test for heterogeneity was not powerful enough to determine whether significant heterogeneity was present. In future updates of this review, should additional trials be included and if there is marked heterogeneity, then the outcomes from different studies will not be pooled.<B>
<BR/>
</B>
<BR/>The authors originally intended to appraise the results of the review by performing sensitivity analyses to examine key decisions and assumptions that might affect the results (<LINK REF="REF-Mulrow-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mulrow 2006</LINK>). However, the included studies yielded such a low volume of good quality data that re-analysis was not performed due to the difficulties in estimating 'reasonable' data. Likewise, we decided it was not appropriate to perform 'funnel plots' to identify publication bias or to attempt sensitivity or sub-group analyses. </P>
<P>Results were expressed as Peto odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous variables, although for comparisons with a high frequency of events, outcomes were given as relative risk (RR) with 95% CI. Results for continuous variables were expressed as standardised mean differences (SMD); for studies where standard deviation was not given, further analysis was not possible and studies were not combined.</P>

<RESULTS>
<STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<P>Forty-four studies were considered for inclusion in the review. The following sclerosant manufacturers were contacted directly for other available data on randomised controlled trials but none were available: Omega Laboratoires Limited, Montreal, Canada (hypertonic saline, polidocanol); Medeva Pharma Limited, Leatherhead, UK (ethanolamine); STD Pharmaceutical, Hereford, UK (STD).</P>
<P>Twenty-seven studies were excluded from the review. Twelve studies (<LINK REF="STD-Ariyoshi-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Ariyoshi 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bountouroglou-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Bountouroglou 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chant-1972" TYPE="STUDY">Chant 1972</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Doran-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Doran 1975</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Einarsson-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Einarsson 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hobbs-1968" TYPE="STUDY">Hobbs 1968</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ikeda-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Ikeda 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Iwamoto-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Iwamoto 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jakobsen-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Jakobsen 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rutgers-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Rutgers 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Scultetus-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Scultetus 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Seddon-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Seddon 1973</LINK>) were randomised controlled trials comparing surgery to sclerotherapy which is the subject of a different Cochrane review from the <I>Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Rigby-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rigby 2004</LINK>). Two further trials compared local anaesthetic removal of varicose veins to sclerotherapy (<LINK REF="STD-Belcaro-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Belcaro 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-De-Roos-2003" TYPE="STUDY">De Roos 2003</LINK>). Seven studies were not randomised controlled trials and were therefore excluded (<LINK REF="STD-Kanter-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Kanter 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Leach-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Leach 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lupton-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Lupton 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Martimbeau-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Martimbeau 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mosley-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Mosley 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Queral-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Queral 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sadick-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Sadick 1991</LINK>). In a further study, it was reported that early recanalisation of the long saphenous vein may be reduced by treating long saphenous tributaries with sclerotherapy in addition to the long saphenous vein itself. However, no numerical data were reported to support this conclusion (<LINK REF="STD-Schadeck-1995b" TYPE="STUDY">Schadeck 1995b</LINK>). Five further studies were excluded because of uncertain methodology and/or absence of numerical data: sclerotherapy with aethoxysclerol versus STD (<LINK REF="STD-Belcaro-2003a" TYPE="STUDY">Belcaro 2003a</LINK>); sclerotherapy with polidocanol foam versus liquid sclerotherapy (<LINK REF="STD-Wright-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Wright 2003</LINK>); sclerotherapy with 1% STD as a foam versus liquid formulation (<LINK REF="STD-Martimbeau-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Martimbeau 2003</LINK>); sclerotherapy with polidocanol foam versus polidocanol foam with Gelofusine (<LINK REF="STD-Zeh-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Zeh 2003</LINK>) and sclerotherapy with STD foam versus perfluoropropane-filled albumin microspheres containing STD (<LINK REF="STD-Martimbeau-2003b" TYPE="STUDY">Martimbeau 2003b</LINK>). </P>
<P>Many of the 17 studies included in the review were performed in the 1980s, although there appears to have been a resurgence of interest in the 2000s. Duration of recruitment ranged from six months to 10 years and study follow-up ranged from three minutes (determination of venous spasm and loss of reflux following sclerotherapy (<LINK REF="STD-Schadeck-1995a" TYPE="STUDY">Schadeck 1995a</LINK>)) to 10 years. All were parallel trials. Thirteen studies were hospital based, two were clinic based and in two studies the setting was not specified. <I>See</I> Table of characteristics of included studies for inclusion and exclusion criteria, details of pattern of venous disease and outcomes. Fourteen studies did not comment on the presence or absence of deep venous insufficiency, whilst three studies excluded these participants (<LINK REF="STD-Belcaro-2003b" TYPE="STUDY">Belcaro 2003b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bukhari-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Bukhari 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hamel_x002d_Desnos-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Hamel-Desnos 2003</LINK>). The studies examined seven main comparisons: </P>
<P>1) sclerotherapy with two different sclerosants, <BR/>2) local anaesthetic in sclerosant versus no local anaesthetic,<BR/>3) sclerotherapy with foam versus liquid formulation,<BR/>4) use of Molefoam versus Sorbo pads at the injection sites following sclerotherapy,<BR/>5) use of elastic compression versus conventional bandaging after sclerotherapy, <BR/>6) short-term versus standard bandaging after sclerotherapy,<BR/>7) sclerotherapy versus graduated compression stockings.</P>
</STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<STUDY_QUALITY>
<P>The method of randomisation was either not stated or was unclear in 14 studies. Numbered sealed envelopes were used in two studies and a randomisation code was used in a further study. Blinding of the studies to the patient and treating doctor was problematic due to the differences in the appearance of different dressings and different follow-up times (<I>see</I> Methods of the review). In eight studies, the outcome assessor was blinded to the randomised treatment. The risk of bias was estimated as low in four studies and moderate in 13 studies. Allocation concealment was considered adequate in two studies and unclear in 15 studies. If we had applied stricter inclusion criteria for the review in terms of randomisation method and blinding of the outcome assessor then 14 out of the 17 studies would be excluded.</P>
</STUDY_QUALITY>
<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
<P>The comparatively low number of trials included in the review meant that the test for heterogeneity was not powerful enough to determine whether significant heterogeneity was present. In addition, the studies yielded such a low volume of good quality data that re-analysis was not carried out due to the difficulties of estimating 'reasonable' data.</P>
<P>There were no randomised trials comparing sclerotherapy to simple observation. Equally, there were no RCTs comparing sclerotherapy for thread veins with either laser treatment or simple observation.</P>
<P>
<B>1) Sclerotherapy with two different sclerosants</B>
<BR/>STD appears to be the most frequently used sclerosant in both randomised and non-randomised trials. Four studies compared alternative sclerosants to STD. <LINK REF="STD-Schadeck-1995a" TYPE="STUDY">Schadeck 1995a</LINK> showed that 4% polidocanol (aetoxysclerol) resulted in more venous spasm following sclerotherapy than 3% STD (RR 7.50, 95% CI 2.06 to 27.25), although the disappearance of superficial venous reflux following sclerotherapy was not statistically significant (RR 1.30, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.96). The analyses in this study are based on estimates from percentage figures quoted in the text. </P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Goldman-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Goldman 2002</LINK> showed no difference in photographic appearance of varicose veins following sclerotherapy with polidocanol (aethoxysklerol) compared to STD (in varying concentrations, according to vein diameter), although polidocanol caused less skin necrosis (Peto OR 0.14, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.71). In contrast, <LINK REF="STD-Labas-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Labas 2003</LINK> showed that STD improved cosmetic appearance of varicose veins and achieved greater symptomatic improvement at six months (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.78 to 0.92), although this effect was non-significant at five years follow-up. For thread veins, 10% hypertonic dextrose had similar efficacy in terms of sclerosis to 0.15% STD (<LINK REF="STD-Prescott-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Prescott 1992</LINK>). Complication rates in terms of pain, matting and pigmentation were not significantly different. </P>
<P>The haemodynamic benefit from sclerotherapy was demonstrated by <LINK REF="STD-Kahle-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Kahle 2003</LINK>. Sclerotherapy with 3% polidocanol reduced venous by arterial flow (as assessed by Duplex ultrasound) to essentially normal levels in comparison with placebo (normal saline). This study did not assess any clinical parameters.</P>
<P>
<B>2) Local anaesthetic in sclerosant versus no local anaesthetic</B>
<BR/>A single study explored whether the addition of local anaesthetic to the sclerosant was beneficial (<LINK REF="STD-Bukhari-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Bukhari 1999</LINK>). Lidocaine/19% hypertonic saline resulted in less moderate or severe pain on injection than 23.4% hypertonic saline alone, although this was of borderline statistical significance (RR 0.25, 95% CI 0.06 to 1.04). Local anaesthetic had no effect on disappearance of varicosities or complications, specifically microthrombosis, ulceration, matting and pigmentation. </P>
<P>
<B>3) Foam versus liquid formation</B>
<BR/>Two studies compared foam sclerotherapy with standard liquid formulation. <LINK REF="STD-Hamel_x002d_Desnos-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Hamel-Desnos 2003</LINK> randomised 88 participants to Duplex-guided sclerotherapy with 3% polidocanol foam or 3% polidocanol liquid. The foam was generated using sterile air in a sclerosant: air ratio of 1:5. Foam sclerotherapy caused more venous spasm than liquid sclerosant (Peto OR 4.27, 95% CI 1.86 to 9.82) with elimination of superficial venous reflux on Duplex ultrasound (Peto OR 6.65, 95% CI 2.82 to 15.69). Complication rates were no different between the two formulations and importantly, recanalisation rates at six months were no different. The VEDICO Trial compared a number of different treatments for varicose veins (<LINK REF="STD-Belcaro-2003b" TYPE="STUDY">Belcaro 2003b</LINK>). The failure rate and incidence of recurrent varicose veins at 5 and 10 years was no different between sclerotherapy with STD foam (foam created using a tensoactive agent J&amp;J-93FA) and liquid formulation.</P>
<P>
<B>4) Use of Molefoam versus Sorbo pads at the injection sites following sclerotherapy</B>
<BR/>One study assessed the effect of two different local pressure dressings applied to each injection site (<LINK REF="STD-Stanley-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Stanley 1991</LINK>). There was no significant difference between Molefoam (Scholl) dressings and the conventional Sorbo rubber pad in terms of successful sclerotherapy (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.13) or erythema following injection (Peto OR 0.44, 95% CI 0.17 to 1.13), although the results tended to favour the Molefoam dressing. No ulcers were caused by sclerotherapy in either group.</P>
<P>
<B>5) Use of elastic compression versus conventional bandaging after sclerotherapy</B>
<BR/>There is no standard method of compression to be used after sclerotherapy. Options include crepe bandaging, proprietary elastic bandaging (e.g. Coban, Elastocrepe) or compression stockings. Increasing the level of compression prevented dressings from slipping (Peto OR 0.49, 95% CI 0.24 to 1.00) but also caused more discomfort (Peto OR 3.65, 95% CI 1.92 to 6.95) (<LINK REF="STD-Fraser-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Fraser 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shouler-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Shouler 1989</LINK>). Increased elastic compression had no significant effect on the incidence of superficial thrombophlebitis (Peto OR 0.79, 95% CI 0.47 to 1.34) or risk of skin staining (<LINK REF="STD-Fraser-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Fraser 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Scurr-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Scurr 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shouler-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Shouler 1989</LINK>). In addition, elastic compression had no significant effect on disappearance of varicosities (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.24) (<LINK REF="STD-Fraser-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Fraser 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Scurr-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Scurr 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shouler-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Shouler 1989</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<B>6) Short-term versus standard bandaging after sclerotherapy</B>
<BR/>Duration of compression following sclerotherapy was the subject of five randomised controlled trials (<LINK REF="STD-Batch-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Batch 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fraser-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Fraser 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moody-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Moody 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Raj-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Raj 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Reddy-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Reddy 1986</LINK>). Results for complication rates and participants' symptoms could not be estimated from two of the trials as standard deviations were not quoted in the published data (<LINK REF="STD-Batch-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Batch 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Reddy-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Reddy 1986</LINK>). However, <LINK REF="STD-Reddy-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Reddy 1986</LINK> stated that there was a significant advantage in three weeks bandaging compared to one week (p&lt;0.001) at two and four years follow-up. This could not be validated from the published data. Two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Fraser-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Fraser 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moody-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Moody 1996</LINK>) showed no difference in superficial thrombophlebitis with short-term bandaging (three days to one week) compared to long-term bandaging (six weeks) (Peto OR 1.06, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.73). The same two studies showed that short-term bandaging resulted in less discomfort, slipping, foot swelling and bandage intolerance than long-term bandaging (RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.73). <LINK REF="STD-Raj-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Raj 1981</LINK> showed no significant difference in cosmetic appearance and symptoms in short-term (eight hours) compared to long-term (six weeks) bandaging (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.08). Three studies showed no difference in the incidence of recurrent varicose veins between short-term and long-term bandaging (Peto OR 0.69, 95% CI 0.43 to 1.10) (<LINK REF="STD-Batch-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Batch 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fraser-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Fraser 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moody-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Moody 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<B>7) Sclerotherapy versus graduated compression stockings</B>
<BR/>A single RCT compared sclerotherapy to graduated compression stockings in pregnancy (<LINK REF="STD-Abramowitz-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Abramowitz 1973</LINK>). Sclerotherapy was more effective in terms of symptomatic improvement and cosmetic appearance (RR 1.61, 95% CI 1.19 to 2.18).</P>
</INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>The goal of injection sclerotherapy is to obliterate the lumen of the incompetent varicose vein or thread vein. This requires both intravascular thrombosis and significant damage to the vascular endothelium, in order to prevent recanalisation by native vessel thrombolysis (<LINK REF="REF-Feied-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Feied 1999</LINK>). Weak sclerosants may cause no endothelial injury, whereas if the volume and concentration of the sclerosant is too high, damage to normal vessels will ensue (<LINK REF="REF-Feied-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Feied 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>In 1963, Fegan published the seminal paper on sclerotherapy, reporting results from 13,352 treated people with a recurrence rate of less than 15% at six years (in a sample of 760 people) (<LINK REF="REF-Fegan-1963" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fegan 1963</LINK>). This paper provided a detailed description of methods to achieve successful sclerotherapy. Fegan highlighted several important points which are covered by this review. Significantly, he emphasised the importance of firm continuous compression following sclerotherapy in order to avoid superficial thrombophlebitis and improve the outcome of the injection. However, these conclusions are not supported by the evidence from this review. Neither the type nor duration of elastic compression used following sclerotherapy has any statistically significant effect on the incidence of superficial thrombophlebitis, obliteration of varicose veins or long-term recurrence rates, which are the most important outcomes of sclerotherapy. Fegan used 3% STD (0.5 ml per injection) for sclerotherapy and this is usually considered as the 'gold standard' sclerosant. This review also shows no benefit from using alternative sclerosants to STD, nor any evidence that sclerosant foam is superior to conventional liquid formulation.</P>
<P>There is, therefore, very limited evidence on which to assess the relative merits of sclerotherapy for treatment of varicose veins. Publication bias may contribute to this with studies showing negative results from sclerotherapy perhaps having been withheld from publication. An important example is the small amount of evidence comparing graduated compression stockings (a recognised treatment option for varicose veins) to sclerotherapy: a single RCT in pregnancy did show benefit for sclerotherapy over compression hosiery. Good evidence for the relative merits of sclerotherapy versus compression hosiery would have important implications for the treatment of varicose veins that are not considered sufficiently severe to warrant surgery according to local and/or national clinical guidelines such as those issued by the National Institute of Clinical Excellence in the placecountry-regionUK. The cost-effectiveness of treatment of varicose veins has important implications for health care. The methodological quality of many of the trials included in the review is questionable. If one were to rigidly adhere to the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 14 out of the 17 included trials would have to be excluded. The main problems with the trials appear to be in the randomisation process and in blinding of the patient and/or observer to the treatment, e.g. type of bandage, duration of bandaging, etc. Many of the trials date back to the 1980s. One would expect that modern trial design would overcome some of these problems.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>In terms of clinical practice, this review shows that there is no robust randomised trial data to influence the choice of sclerosant, sclerosant formulation, local pressure dressing, degree of compression or length of compression following sclerotherapy. Short-term bandaging is better tolerated than more prolonged bandaging. One RCT has shown that sclerotherapy is more effective than compression hosiery in pregnancy. The overall place for sclerotherapy in the management of varicose veins cannot be determined from this review.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>For symptomatic varicose veins, there is little evidence to support or dispute the continued use of sclerotherapy. The place of sclerotherapy in comparison to surgery is the subject of a further Cochrane review from the <I>Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews </I>(<LINK REF="REF-Rigby-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rigby 2004</LINK>). Current research in sclerotherapy is focused on sclerosant foam. Initial case series suggest that 88 to 93% of varicose veins could be obliterated using these techniques (<LINK REF="REF-Frullini-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Frullini 2002</LINK>). To date, RCT evidence does not support the efficacy of foam over conventional liquid formulation.</P>
<P>For thread veins, a randomised controlled trial of sclerotherapy versus laser treatment or thermo-coagulation (Veinwave<SUP>TM</SUP>) could provide answers regarding the benefits of sclerotherapy. This would be difficult to set up in the UK, as treatment for thread veins is not generally available on the National Health Service, and the ethics of setting up a randomised trial in private practice are problematic.</P>

<FEEDBACK_SUMMARY MODIFIED="2011-04-08 10:34:57 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Marlene Stewart">
<P>I noticed a few errors:<BR/>1. Analysis 7.1 - the "Favours sclero" and "favours stockings" headings under the Forest plot are the wrong way round, which is very misleading (many reader will not read the text fully and will only look at the plots)<BR/>2. Several of the Forest plots have non-sensical results - SDs are zero, and MD and CIs are also zero - for example, analysis 6.5.<BR/>
</P>

<FEEDBACK_REPLY MODIFIED="2011-04-08 10:34:37 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Marlene Stewart">
<P>The forest plot labels for Analysis 7.1 have been corrected. Comment 2 will be addressed in the update of this review.</P>
