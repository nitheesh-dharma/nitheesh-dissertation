I'm not sure if Hardy or Herrera gives enough info on exclusion criteria even though it was scored 1 in the methodological quality assessment score (MQAS). Should the specifics of inclusion/exclusion criteria (eg some studies excluded patients who could not walk pre-op) be discussed? Why did papasimos get scored a zero for item 4 in the MQAS but Herrera got a one? Should marques item 5 score a 0 since there were mor junior staff performing operation in gamma nail group? i'm not sure if marques post operative care was well enough described. Starr and herrera risk bias commentary incorrect - no mention of post op care being the same. Why did schipper score 0 on loss to follow up? Short term was good. Was it because of only 4 month follow up in some cases?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Joe, wonder if we should classify de grave (difference in surgeons' expertise) as unclear. It says 'a senior orthopaedic resident' in methods but in discussion they admit that NINE different surgeons performed the ops which is a weakness of the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Joe, did Marques clarify with you that there was no funding? We weren't sure before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Joe. Are the comments in Schipper ROB to be left in (in particular differential expertise bias question)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Joe, Not sure how to fill out item 3 in ROB discussion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Joe can you review the length of the PFNA nail in Zhang characteristics table?

I am not sure if that was me initially or in the editing afterwards. I will have a look back at old versions but you might just check that it is okay. Also are we completely sure at the long term judging of efstathopoulous as unclear is correct? I have left in one section (highlighted) that i think should be removed as we classified these as unclear in our final ROB though Zhu has 28/126 loss, papasimons lost 11/141 but unclear which groups and schipper only had 140/424 at one year&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" NOTES_MODIFIED="2014-09-09 15:52:30 +0100" NOTES_MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]" REVIEW_NO="106" REVMAN_SUB_VERSION="5.3.4 " REVMAN_VERSION="5" SPLIT_FROM="" STAGE="R" STATUS="A" TYPE="INTERVENTION" VERSION_NO="6.0">

<TITLE>Intramedullary nails for extracapsular hip fractures in adults</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2014-09-02 04:29:45 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>
<B>What is the medical problem?</B>
</P>
<P>Fractures of the upper part of the thigh bone (femur) are termed hip or proximal femoral fractures. These fractures are most common in women aged over 65 years. Roughly two out of five hip fractures are 'extracapsular' in that they lie outside the hip joint capsule.</P>
<P>
<B>What treatments are available?</B>
</P>
<P>The majority of these fractures are fixed surgically using metal implants. One increasingly used implant is the 'intramedullary nail'. This consists of a metal rod, which is usually inserted from the upper end of the femur into the inner cavity (medulla) of the femur bone and held in place with screws. There are several different types of nails, usually made by different manufacturers, in use.</P>
<P>
<B>Are some intramedullary nails better than others for these fractures?</B>
</P>
<P>This review set out to examine the evidence from trials that compared different designs of nails in clinical practice.</P>
<P>We searched medical databases and registers of new studies (until January 2014) and found 17 trials that compared different nail designs. These involved a total of 2130 participants. Most participants were older women.</P>
<P>The quality of the evidence from these trials is low or very low, partly because most trials used flawed methods that mean their results may not be reliable. In addition, several trials did not report on function or provide data that could be used. Of the 12 different comparisons tested, nine were tested by one trial only.</P>
<P>Four trials compared the proximal femoral nail (PFN) with the Gamma nail in 910 older adults. Two trials compared the ACE intramedullary nail with the Gamma nail in 185 older adults. Two trials compared the proximal femoral nail antirotation (PFNA) with the Gamma 3 nail in 200 older adults. The other nine trials were single comparisons of different types of nail designs.</P>
<P>Overall, the weak evidence available for all 12 comparisons showed no important differences in outcome (function, mobility, pain, death, fracture fixation complications and revision surgery) between the two nails or two nail designs under test. There was one possible exception. There was weak evidence from one trial of 215 older adults that the ENDOVIS nail resulted in poorer mobility (more people could not walk after their operation) when compared with the intramedullary hip screw (IMHS). However, more evidence is required to be confident of this result.</P>
<P>In conclusion, the available evidence is insufficient to determine whether there are important differences in outcome between different designs of intramedullary nails used for fixing extracapsular hip fractures. In terms of future research, we propose that priority is given to comparisons of intramedullary nails with another type of device in common use, the sliding hip screw.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-09-02 17:03:22 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included eight new trials, testing seven new comparisons in this update. Overall, we included 17 trials, testing 12 comparisons of different cephalocondylic nail designs. The trials involved a total of 2130 adults (predominantly female and older people) with mainly unstable trochanteric fractures.</P>
<P>All trials were at unclear risk of bias for most domains, with the majority at high risk of detection bias for subjective outcomes. The three quasi-randomised trials were at high risk for selection bias.</P>
<P>Four trials (910 participants) compared the proximal femoral nail (PFN) with the Gamma nail. There was no significant difference between the two implants in functional outcome (the very low quality evidence being limited to results from single trials), mortality (low quality evidence: 86/415 versus 80/415; risk ratio (RR) 1.08, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.82 to 1.41), serious fixation complications (operative fracture of the femur, cut-out, non-union and later fracture of the femur) nor re-operations (low quality evidence: 45/455 versus 36/455; RR 1.25, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.90).</P>
<P>Two trials (185 participants) provided very low quality evidence of a lack of clinically significant difference in outcome (functional score, mortality, fracture fixation complications and re-operation) between the ACE trochanteric nail and the Gamma nail.</P>
<P>Two trials (200 participants) provided very low quality evidence of a lack of significant difference in outcome (mobility score, pain, fracture fixation complications or re-operations) between the proximal femoral nail antirotation (PFNA) nail and the Gamma 3 nail.</P>
<P>Seven of the nine trials evaluating different comparisons provided very low quality evidence of a lack of significant between-group differences in all of the reported main outcomes for the following comparisons: ACE trochanteric nail versus Gamma 3 nail (112 participants); gliding nail versus Gamma nail (80 participants); Russell-Taylor Recon nail versus long Gamma nail (34 participants, all under 50 years); proximal femoral nail antirotation (PFNA) nail versus Targon PF nail (80 participants); dynamically versus statically locked intramedullary hip screw (IMHS) nail (81 participants); sliding versus non-sliding Gamma 3 nail (80 participants, all under 60 years); and long versus standard PFNA nails (40 participants with reverse oblique fractures).</P>
<P>The other two single comparison trials also provided very low quality evidence of a lack of significant between-group differences in all of the main outcomes with single exceptions. The trial (215 participants) comparing the ENDOVIS nail versus the IMHS nail found low quality evidence of poorer mobility in the ENDOVIS nail group, where more participants in this group were bedridden after their operation (29/105 versus 18/110; RR 1.69, 95% CI 1.00 to 2.85; P = 0.05). The trial (113 participants) comparing the InterTan nail versus the PFNA II nail found very low quality evidence that more PFNA II group participants experienced thigh pain (3/47 versus 12/46; RR: 0.24, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.81).</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2014-08-13 11:21:53 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The limited evidence from the randomised trials undertaken to date is insufficient to determine whether there are important differences in outcome between different designs of intramedullary nails used in treating extracapsular hip fractures. Given the evidence of superiority of the sliding hip screw compared with intramedullary nails for extracapsular hip fractures, further studies comparing different designs of intramedullary nails are not a priority. Any new design should be evaluated in a randomised comparison with the sliding hip screw.</P>

<P>Hip fracture is the general term for fracture of the proximal (upper) femur. These fractures can be subdivided into intracapsular fractures (those occurring within or proximal to the attachment of the hip joint capsule to the femur) and extracapsular (those occurring outside or distal to the hip joint capsule). Extracapsular hip fractures are defined as those fractures that occur within the area of bone bounded by the attachment of the hip joint capsule and extending down to a level which is five centimetres below the distal (lower) border of the lesser trochanter. Other terms used to describe these fractures include trochanteric, subtrochanteric, pertrochanteric and intertrochanteric fractures. These terms reflect the proximity of these fractures to the greater and lesser trochanters, which are two bony protuberances (bulges) at the upper end of the femur outside the joint capsule.</P>
<P>Hip fractures occur predominantly in older people (aged over 65 years), especially women. The incidence of hip fracture varies considerably between different populations (<LINK REF="REF-Bjorgul-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bjorgul 2007</LINK>). An incidence of 1024 per 100,000 for women over 50, and 452 per 100,000 for men over 50 was reported for Norway between 1998 and 2003 (<LINK REF="REF-Bjorgul-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bjorgul 2007</LINK>). The relative proportion of extracapsular fractures also varies: 39% of hip fractures were extracapsular fractures in <LINK REF="REF-Bjorgul-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bjorgul 2007</LINK> and 48% in <LINK REF="REF-Karagas-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Karagas 1996</LINK>. A summary of the casemix for 61,508 hip fractures occurring between 1 April 2012 and 31 March 2013 in 180 hospitals in England, Wales and Northern Ireland is presented by an annual report of the <A HREF="http://www.nhfd.co.uk/">National Hip Fracture Database</A> (<LINK REF="REF-NHFD-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">NHFD 2013</LINK>). This shows that around three-quarters of hip fractures (73.2%) occurred in women, and over 90% of cases were aged over 70 years. In each of four years from 2009, around 40% of fractures were extracapsular.</P>
<P>Numerous subdivisions and classification methods exist for these fractures (e.g. the AO classification (<LINK REF="REF-Muller-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Muller 1991</LINK>)). The most practical classification, and that used for this review, is the basic division into four types: stable trochanteric fractures (AO classification type A1); unstable trochanteric fractures (AO classification type A2); fractures at the level of the lesser trochanter (transtrochanteric or AO classification type A3); and subtrochanteric fractures. Stable trochanteric fractures are two part fractures in which the fracture line runs obliquely (at an angle) between the lesser and greater trochanter of the femur. Unstable trochanteric fractures again have an oblique fracture line running between the trochanters, but in addition there is comminution (fragmentation) of the fracture site. The comminution fragments may be the lesser trochanter, greater trochanter or both trochanters. Transtrochanteric fractures, sited at the level of the lesser trochanter, have a slightly more distally located (lower) fracture line that either runs transversely (across the bone) at the level of the lesser trochanter or in an oblique direction that is opposite (or 'reverse') to that of the stable and unstable trochanteric fractures. Transtrochanteric fractures may be two part or comminuted. This fracture pattern is unstable as the femur is displaced medially (inwards) due to the pull of the adductor muscles. Subtrochanteric fractures are those fractures in which the fracture crossing the femur is predominately found within the five centimetres of bone immediately below the lesser trochanter. These fractures may be two part or comminuted, and in some instances the fracture may extend proximally into the trochanteric region or distally into the shaft of the femur.</P>

<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2014-05-27 20:36:18 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Operative treatment of hip fractures was introduced in the 1950s using a variety of different implants. Implants may be either extramedullary or intramedullary in nature. The most commonly used extramedullary implant is the sliding hip screw (SHS), which is synonymous with the term compression hip screw and equivalent models such as the Dynamic, Richards or Ambi hip screws. Intramedullary nails used for the internal fixation of extracapsular fractures can either be inserted from proximal to distal (cephalocondylic nails) or from distal to proximal (condylocephalic nails).</P>
<P>Cephalocondylic nails are inserted through the greater trochanter of the femur and secured by a cross pin or screw, which is passed up the femoral neck into the femoral head. A number of different designs have been developed and marketed by different manufacturers. Examples include the Gamma nail (Stryker-Howmedica), the intramedullary hip screw (Smith and Nephew Richards), the proximal femoral nail (Synthes) and the ACE trochanteric nail (DePuy Orthopaedics). <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK> presents further information of the nails to date examined by the included trials in this review.</P>
<P>Condylocephalic nails are inserted into the distal femur and passed up the intramedullary cavity across the fracture site and up into the femoral head. The best known and tested type of such nails is the Ender nail.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2014-09-02 06:55:33 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Successive updates of our Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-Parker-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parker 2010</LINK>) comparing the Gamma and other cephalocondylic intramedullary nails with extramedullary implants for extracapsular hip fractures have consistently found that cephalocondylic nails incur the complications of intra-operative fracture, and later fracture around the implant. Based primarily on the higher rate of complications and re-operations of these nails for trochanteric fractures, we suggested that the SHS (an extramedullary implant) appears to be the better device for these fractures. We also suggested that "Further studies are required to determine if different types of intramedullary nail produce similar results, or if intramedullary nails have advantages for selected fracture types (for example, subtrochanteric fractures)."</P>
<P>Our Cochrane review of randomised trials comparing condylocephalic nails with extramedullary fixation (<LINK REF="REF-Parker-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parker 1998</LINK>) concluded that the use of condylocephalic nails could not be recommended because of the markedly increased risk of fracture-healing complications and other problems associated with condylocephalic nails (in particular Ender nails).</P>

<P>Despite the evidence of poor performance of intramedullary nails in comparison with the SHS (an extramedullary implant), developments and modifications to intramedullary nails, especially cephalocondylic nails, continue. Additionally, the use of these nails is increasing (<LINK REF="REF-Anglen-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anglen 2008</LINK>). This systematic review of randomised trials examines studies that have compared different types, or modifications to the design, of intramedullary nails for extracapsular proximal femoral fractures. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in <LINK REF="REF-Parker-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parker 2005</LINK> and last updated in <LINK REF="REF-Parker-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parker 2008</LINK>.</P>

<P>Skeletally mature patients with an extracapsular proximal femoral fracture. Given that one of the authors (MJP) has become aware of the growing use of intramedullary nails in intracapsular fractures, we note here that in a future update we will consider including trials with a mixed population of intracapsular and extracapsular proximal femoral fractures. We will, however, request separate data for the two fracture types. </P>

<P>At least two review authors (always JQ and EH) independently assessed risk of bias for all trials without masking of the source and authorship of the trial reports, including those that had been assessed in previous versions of the review. We piloted the assessment form on one trial. JQ checked between rater consistency in assessment at data entry, and this was subsequently checked by HH. We resolved all differences by discussion. We used the tool outlined in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). This tool incorporates assessment of randomisation (sequence generation and allocation concealment), blinding (of participants and treatment providers, and outcome assessment), completeness of outcome data, selection of outcomes reported, and other sources of bias. We considered 'subjective' outcomes (e.g. functional outcome scores, pain) and 'objective' outcomes (mortality, complications) separately in our assessment of blinding (outcome assessment) and short-term (in hospital; up to four months) and longer-term (four months and above; post-hospital discharge) outcomes for completeness of outcome data. We assessed three additional sources of bias: bias resulting from major imbalances in key baseline characteristics (e.g. age, gender, type of fracture, prior mobility); performance bias, particularly 'differential expertise' bias resulting from lack of comparability in surgeon's expertise with the devices under test; and bias relating to a commercial conflict of interest.</P>

<P>The 17 trials included in this review, involving a total of predominantly female and older participants with predominantly unstable trochanteric fractures, tested 12 comparisons of different cephalocondylic nail designs.

<P>All four trials contributing to this comparison were at high risk of bias. Of note, is that two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Herrera-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Herrera 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Marques-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Marques 2005</LINK>) were quasi-randomised and thus at high risk of selection bias; and the other two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Papasimos-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Papasimos 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schipper-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Schipper 2004</LINK>) were at high risk of attrition bias.</P>
<P>There were no significant differences between groups in functional outcome, these data being limited to results from single trials. Pooled results from three trials showed no difference in mortality between the two groups (86/415 versus 80/415; risk ratio (RR) 1.08; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.82 to 1.41). There were no statistically significant differences between the two implants in serious fixation complications (operative fracture of the femur, cut-out, non-union and later fracture of the femur) nor re-operations (45/455 versus 36/455; RR 1.25, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.90). These revision rates (9.8% versus 7.9%) are high, particularly in the context of those found for short femoral nails (5.4%) or, indeed, the sliding hip screw (3.4%) (<LINK REF="REF-Parker-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parker 2010</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Schipper-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Schipper 2004</LINK> acknowledged the high revision rates, for both implants in their study but stressed their inclusion of exclusively unstable fractures.</P>

<P>The outcome of <LINK REF="STD-Vidyadhara-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Vidyadhara 2007</LINK>, which had no deaths or loss to follow-up, was very favourable for both groups as shown by the usually high Harris hip scores with very little variation within each group. Supposing that the correct statistics were presented, the clinical significance of the statistically significant differences in the Harris hip scores at one year follow-up (MD 1.00, 95% CI 0.28 to 1.72) is questionable. Two participants died in each group of <LINK REF="STD-Efstathopoulos-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Efstathopoulos 2007</LINK>.

This small trial, which reported results for 33 participants with reverse oblique fractures, was described as a "pilot" and no power analysis being conducted beforehand. No significant differences were found for the majority of outcomes including mortality, functional scores (Harris hip score, Parker and Palmer mobility score), fracture fixation complications and re-operation. There was no significant difference in the length of hospital stay. As expected, overall operating and fluoroscopy times were shorter in the standard PFNA group; reaming of the femoral canal is rarely required with this implant.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2014-09-02 17:04:27 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Nine of the 12 comparisons in the review were made in single trials, whose populations ranged from 34 participants to 215 participants. The maximum number of participants available in any pooled analysis for the two remaining comparisons was 910 and 197 respectively. There was no pooling of functional outcomes, such as Harris hip scores, which were under-reported and recorded. For each comparison, there were insufficient patient numbers to rule out important differences, particularly in final outcomes, between the implants under test.</P>
<P>The trial populations were generally representative of the populations with these fractures. As indicated above, <LINK REF="STD-Starr-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Starr 2006</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Zhu-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Zhu 2012</LINK> were two exceptions to this with an upper age limit of 50 years being applied in <LINK REF="STD-Starr-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Starr 2006</LINK> and 60 years being applied in <LINK REF="STD-Zhu-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Zhu 2012</LINK>. <LINK REF="STD-Starr-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Starr 2006</LINK> was also exceptional in its inclusion of a few subtrochanteric fractures. The other exception is <LINK REF="STD-Okcu-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Okcu 2013</LINK>, which included reverse oblique fractures only. Particular emphasis was made in <LINK REF="STD-Zhang-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Zhang 2013</LINK> on the use of nails that reflect a difference in geometry between Asian and Caucasian femur geometry.</P>
<P>It is noteworthy that this review is predominantly a set of comparisons of intramedullary nails from different manufacturers. Newer nails have different features aimed at enhancing stability and reducing known complications (such as operative or later femoral shaft fractures). But as well as testing for improved performance of these different features in the clinical setting, it could be conjectured that it is also the market place that has set the research agenda and the associated aims of these generally underpowered trials. </P>
<P>As stated above, functional outcomes were under-recorded and reported. Several trials failed to report separate statistics for mortality. We have already alerted the reader to the unusually high re-operation rates in the PFN versus Gamma nail comparison and also the very high rate of elective removal of implants for pain in <LINK REF="STD-Starr-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Starr 2006</LINK>.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2014-09-02 10:49:02 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>As summarised above for the individual comparisons, all trials were at unclear risk of bias for several domains and most trials were at high risk of detection bias for subjective outcomes. Poor reporting of methods of randomisation and participant flow were commonplace and resulted in concerns regarding both selection and attrition biases in several trials.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Proximal femoral nail (PFN) versus the Gamma nail</HEADING>
<P>The quality of the evidence for this comparison was downgraded three levels for function (one for limitations in design and implementation that related to potential risk of bias; one for imprecision; and one because data were only available from one trial); two levels for mortality (one for limitations in design and implementation that related to potential risk of bias; and one because data were absent from one trial and a substantial number of participants for another trial) and two levels for fracture fixation complications and re-operation (one for limitations in design and implementation that related to potential risk of bias; and one for either imprecision or that substantial amounts of data were absent).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">ACE trochanteric nail versus the Gamma nail</HEADING>
<P>The quality of the evidence for this comparison was downgraded three levels for all primary outcomes (one for limitations in design and implementation that related to potential risk of bias; one for imprecision; and one because data were only available from one trial or were highly unrepresentative of the general population).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">PFNA versus the Gamma 3 nail</HEADING>
<P>The quality of evidence for this comparison was downgraded three levels for mortality and function (one for limitation in design and implementation that related to potential risk of bias in multiple areas including allocation, blinding, attritional and reporting bias; one for imprecision of results due to small numbers of trial participants; and one because data were only available from one trial for the majority of these outcomes). The quality of evidence for fracture fixation complications was downgraded two levels (one for limitation in design that related to potential risk of bias; and one for imprecision related to the small number of participants in each trial or the substantial loss to follow-up).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Remaining comparisons</HEADING>
<P>With one exception, the quality of the evidence for each comparison involving single trials was downgraded three levels for all outcomes. This generally included the downgrading by one for limitations in design and implementation that related to potential risk of bias; one for imprecision; and one because data were from one underpowered trial. The consistent finding of poorer mobility for the ENDOVIS nail when compared with the IMHS was considered to merit an upgrading by one point.</P>
<P>This overall, reflected a triple downgrading; we judged the evidence to be of very low quality, which indicates that we are very uncertain about the estimates for all outcomes. For the first comparison, however, there was a double downgrading for mortality. For the first (PFN versus the Gamma nail) and third (PFNA versus the Gamma 3 nail) comparisons there was a double downgrading for fracture fixation complications. For these, we judged the evidence to be low quality and thus we consider that further research is very likely to change the estimated effect and affect our confidence in this result.</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2014-01-03 21:59:13 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>While our search was comprehensive, it is possible that we have failed to identify some trials, especially those reported in conference proceedings only. Changing methodology and authorship between updates can be challenging and while we have taken a systematic approach, extra vigilance and checks have been required to ensure a satisfactory transition and consistency. Inevitably, the risk of bias judgements of similar aspects of trial quality do not neatly correspond to the previous ratings for previous trials; this difference is probably greater given that risk of bias assessment was done by a different pair of reviewers. The restructuring of the <LINK TAG="CRIT_OUTCOMES" TYPE="SECTION">Types of outcome measures</LINK> and reporting of the results presented the greatest challenge. Rather than completely rewrite the previous review, we took a pragmatic decision to reorder the categories of outcomes and highlight the primary outcomes.</P>

<P>There was insufficient evidence from randomised trials to determine if there are important differences in patient outcomes between the different designs of proximal femoral intramedullary nail produced by different manufacturers when used for the fixation of unstable, or stable, trochanteric fractures.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2014-09-02 10:55:40 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Given the evidence indicating the current superiority of the sliding hip screw (SHS) over intramedullary nails for trochanteric fractures (<LINK REF="REF-Parker-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parker 2010</LINK>), it is debatable whether studies comparing different types or aspects of intramedullary nail design should be undertaken. Nonetheless, while we suggest that further development and modification of cephalocondylic nails for these fractures is not a priority, any new developments should be evaluated using robust methodology with adequate patient numbers and the collection of functional outcomes. We suggest the choice of comparator of any such trial should be the SHS.</P>

<P>1. In line with Collaboration recommendations, the review now assesses risk of bias.<BR/>2. In <LINK TAG="CRIT_INTERVENTIONS" TYPE="SECTION">Types of interventions</LINK>, we clarified our criteria for selecting the control groups in the various comparisons.<BR/>3. The types of outcome measures were restructured into primary, secondary, other and economic outcomes (<I>see</I> <LINK REF="APP-05" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 5</LINK> for previous list). Given the correspondence between the previous and revised outcome measures was presentational rather than content, we opted to retain the five previous outcome categories (1. Operative details; 2. Fracture fixation complications; 3. Post-operative complications and hospital stay; 4. Anatomical restoration; 5. Final outcome measures) but to adjust their order (5; 2; 3; 4; 1) and clarify their relationship to the revised outcomes (<I>see</I> <LINK REF="APP-04" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 4</LINK>).<BR/>4.

Between May 1998 and January 2000, 50 patients (mean age 79 years) were alternately treated with LGN10 or LGN11. The femoral antecurvature varied from 6 degrees to 10 degrees, with a maximum of 14 degrees, as evidenced by lateral radiograms. The need for intramedullary reaming in LGN10 cases was significantly less ( p=0.046). Other significant differences between the two study groups were not observed. One cranial cut out of the lag screw in the LGN10 group was observed. Other complications were not recorded during hospital treatment. Follow-up results are not yet complete. Using LGN10 seems to reduce intramedullary damage to the femur and make insertion of the nail easier&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" NOTES_MODIFIED="2014-05-20 00:05:09 +0100" NOTES_MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]" YEAR="2003">

<P>Description</P>
</TH>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>
<P>Endovis nail</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>The Endovis nail (Citieffe Ltd) is available in 3 sizes (195 to 400 mm) and has a neck shaft angle of 130°. It has two cephalic screws for the femoral head to facilitate fracture compression. The distal section is slotted to produce a graduated variation of stiffness</P>
</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">
<P>Gamma nail</P>
</TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">
<P>The Gamma nail (Stryker Ltd) was introduced in the late 1980s for the treatment of extracapsular hip fractures. The implant consists of a sliding lag screw which passes through a short intramedullary nail placed via the trochanteric entry point. One or two screws may be passed through the nail tip to secure it to the femoral shaft (distal locking). Theoretical advantages of this implant are due to a percutaneous insertion technique and include reduced blood loss, minimal soft tissue trauma and short operating time. Modifications to the design of the Gamma nail and its instrumentation have occurred since its introduction. The long Gamma nail has a range of different lengths from 280 to 460 mm with two distal locking screw options. An Asian-Pacific version of the nail is available for use in the Asian population and has reduced length, diameter and mediolateral angle to accommodate small femurs typically seen in this group</P>
</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>
<P>Gamma 3 nail</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>The Gamma 3 nail (Stryker Ltd) is the third generation of the gamma nail fixation system for proximal femoral fractures. It is a trochanteric entry nail with a reduced proximal nail diameter (15.5 mm versus 17 mm) to facilitate a shorter incision. Its length options range from 280 mm to 460 mm. Its neck shaft angle options include 120°, 125° and 130°. The lag screw shape has also been modified to provide superior cutting behaviour and greater resistance to cut-out. One trial in this review compared a sliding and a non-sliding lag screw mechanism in the Gamma 3 nail</P>
</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>
<P>Gliding nail</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>The gliding nail (Smith-Nephew) is a trochanteric entry nail designed to avoid the complications of implants such as the Gamma nail. It utilises a T-shaped femoral neck blade that has an extensive surface area relative to other intramedullary devices which provides good rotational stability and a high resistance to fatigue fracture. The T-shaped blade can slide through the nail, facilitating fracture compression and healing. The standard length is 220 mm with long nail options ranging from 340 mm to 440 mm. Blade shaft angles include 125° and 135°</P>
</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">
<P>Intramedullary hip screw (IMHS)</P>
</TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">
<P>The IMHS (Smith and Nephew), length 210 mm, was introduced in 1991 for the treatment of extracapsular femoral fractures. Like the Gamma nail, it consists of a nail inserted via the greater trochanter into the medullary cavity. It utilises a single screw in the femoral head that can slide through a barrel in the nail allowing fracture compression. Three different neck angles are available, 125°, 130° and 135°. Nail lengths are available from 195 mm to 440 mm</P>
</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">
<P>Proximal femoral nail (PFN)</P>
</TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">
<P>The PFN (Synthes Ltd), length 240 mm, was introduced in 1998 for the treatment of extracapsular fractures. Like the Gamma and IMHS, it consists of a nail inserted via the greater trochanter into the medullary cavity. Two lengths are available, 200 mm and 240 mm. Two proximal lag screws are passed up the femoral neck to the head. Distal locking can be performed in static or dynamic mode via two distal locking screws</P>
</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">
<P>Proximal femoral nail antirotation (PFNA)</P>
</TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">
<P>The PFNA (Synthes Ltd), length 170 mm, 200 mm or 240 mm, is a modification of the PFN nail. It is similar to the PFN nail apart from not having two proximal lag screws, but instead a single helically-shaped blade which is designed to provide increased angular and rotational stability. The helical blade is designed to avoid bone loss that occurs during drilling and insertion of a standard hip screw. It has 2 distal locking screw options for either dynamic or static locking. Blade shaft angle options include 125°, 130° and 135°</P>
</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>
<P>Proximal femoral nail antirotation II (PFNA II)</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>The PFNA II (Synthes Ltd) is a modification of the PFNA nail to address the different proximal femoral anatomy of Asian patients. The PFNA has a large proximal diameter (17 mm) which was thought to account for the increase in femoral shaft fracture, lateral cortex splitting and thigh pain reported in Asian patients. The PFNA II has a smaller proximal diameter (16.5 mm versus 17 mm) and a flatter lateral shape (5° versus 6°)</P>
</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">
<P>Targon PF (proximal femoral) nail</P>
</TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">
<P>The Targon PF nail (B Braun Ltd), length 220 mm, is inserted into the intramedullary cavity via a trochanteric entry point. Proximally, this nail has a sliding lag screw and an antirotation pin. The Targon PF nail facilitates fracture dynamisation via a gliding screw that glides through a sleeve that is attached to the nail, thereby avoiding protrusion of the screw into peritrochanteric tissues</P>
</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">
<P>ACE trochanteric nail</P>
</TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">
<P>The ACE nail (Depuy) has a 10.5 mm lag screw and an optional antirotation lag screw. It has 2 distal holes for static or dynamic locking. Its proximal diameter is 16 mm and length is 180 mm or 200 mm</P>
</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">
<P>Russell-Taylor Recon nail</P>
</TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">
<P>The Russel-Taylor Recon nail (Smith-Nephew) is an intramedullary nail that utilises a piriformis entry point. 2 screws are available for fixation in the femoral head. It is a full length femoral nail with no short versions available for proximal femoral fixation only</P>

<P>The InterTan nail (Smith-Nephew) uses 2 cephalocervical screws in an integrated mechanism allowing intra-operative compression and rotational stability of the head-neck fragments. It has a cannulated set screw mechanism that allows for the device to be used in fixed angle mode or in sliding/compression mode. Its length ranges from 180 mm to 460 mm (long nail option)</P>
