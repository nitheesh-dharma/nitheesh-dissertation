<SUMMARY>
<TITLE>Does the timing and route of nutritional support have an effect on survival and disability in head-injured patients?</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>After a moderate or severe head injury, patients use more energy as their body's metabolism is working at a greater rate. This increases the body's nutritional requirements which may lead to malnutrition and other complications. </P>
<P>Patients are often unable to meet the increased requirements by oral feeding alone, even if oral feeding is possible, therefore other methods are required. However, the method and timing of nutritional support can differ. Some can be started immediately following head injury but others may be delayed until the digestive system is found to be functioning.</P>
<P>Enteral nutrition is provided by inserting a feeding tube via the nose or mouth, into the stomach or small intestine. The feeding tube delivers a liquid formula containing the required nutrients. Total parenteral nutrition (TPN) provides an alternative to conventional enteral feeding. Parenteral nutrition means feeding someone via their blood stream (intravenously). Total parenteral nutrition (TPN) means that a patient is only fed intravenously. This method may carry risks of infectious complications.</P>
<P>It is unclear whether the timing and route of the administration of nutrition has an effect on mortality and morbidity of head-injured patients. The authors of this a systematic review searched for all high quality trials to determine the best timing (early or delayed), and route (enteral or parental) of nutritional support following head injury.</P>
<P>The authors identified 11 eligible trials that investigated the timing and route of nutritional support in head-injured patients. These trials included a total of 534 patients. However, of the many of the trials had methodological weaknesses.</P>
<P>The authors found that early feeding may be associated with fewer infections and a trend towards better outcomes in terms of survival and disability. However, the trials were small so any improvements detected were on a small scale. Also the focus of many of the trials was on nutritional outcomes, and many did not report the effect on death and disability. The authors were unable to obtain data for death and disability for all of the included trials so they feel there may be a possibility of bias. Further trials of nutritional support following head injury are required. These trials should report death and disability as well nutritional outcomes. They should also be large enough to detect clinically important treatment effects. </P>
</SUMMARY_BODY>
</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Head injury increases the body's metabolic responses, and therefore nutritional demands. Provision of an adequate supply of nutrients is associated with improved outcome. The best route for administering nutrition (parenterally (TPN) or enterally (EN)), and the best timing of administration (for example, early versus late) of nutrients needs to be established.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To quantify the effect on mortality and morbidity of alternative strategies of providing nutritional support following head injury.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>Trials were identified by computerised searches of the Cochrane Injuries Group specialised register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, EMBASE, National Research Register, Web of Science and other electronic trials registers. Reference lists of trials and review articles were checked. The searches were last updated in July 2006.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomised controlled trials of timing or route of nutritional support following acute traumatic brain injury.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Two authors independently abstracted data and assessed trial quality. Information was collected on death, disability, and incidence of infection. If trial quality was unclear, or if there were missing outcome data, trialists were contacted in an attempt to get further information.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>A total of 11 trials were included. Seven trials addressed the timing of support (early versus delayed), data on mortality were obtained for all seven trials (284 participants). The relative risk (RR) for death with early nutritional support was 0.67 (95% CI 0.41 to 1.07). Data on disability were available for three trials. The RR for death or disability at the end of follow-up was 0.75 (95% CI 0.50 to 1.11). Seven trials compared parenteral versus enteral nutrition. Because early support often involves parenteral nutrition, three of the trials are also included in the previous analyses. Five trials (207 participants) reported mortality. The RR for mortality at the end of follow-up period was 0.66 (0.41 to 1.07). Two trials provided data on death and disability. The RR was 0.69 (95% Cl 0.40 to 1.19). One trial compared gastric versus jejunal enteral nutrition, there were no deaths and the RR was not estimable.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>This review suggests that early feeding may be associated with a trend towards better outcomes in terms of survival and disability. Further trials are required. These trials should report not only nutritional outcomes but also the effect on death and disability.</P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>

<BACKGROUND>
<P>Patients with moderate and severe head injury demonstrate hypermetabolism, increased energy expenditure, and increased protein loss. Several reports demonstrate that following head injury energy requirements increase substantially (<LINK REF="REF-Deutsman-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deutsman 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Phillips-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Phillips 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Weekes-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weekes 1996</LINK>). Nitrogen excretion increases significantly for up to four weeks leading to increased nitrogen requirements (<LINK REF="REF-Clifton-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clifton 1984</LINK>). It has been argued that nutritional support can prevent the loss of immune competence, and decrease morbidity, mortality, and the length of hospital stay associated with head injury (<LINK REF="STD-Young-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Young 1987</LINK>). </P>
<P>Nutritional support for acutely head-injured patients is sometimes delayed until gastrointestinal function has returned to normal in the post injury period (<LINK REF="REF-Ott-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ott 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Norton-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Norton 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rapp-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Rapp 1983</LINK>). In particular, if enteral feeding is provided by a nasogastric tube, feeding is often delayed until bowel sounds are heard. Total parenteral nutrition (TPN) provides an alternative to conventional enteral feeding particularly in the acute post head injury period. However, the advantages of TPN may be offset by the occurrence of infectious complications such as septicaemia.</P>
<P>Early enteral nutrition may prevent malnutrition, intestinal mucosal atrophy and also preserve normal gut flora (<LINK REF="REF-Maynard-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maynard 1991</LINK>). Early enteral feeding has also been shown to reduce septic complications (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 1991</LINK>). Jejunal feeding has been used to overcome poor gastric emptying.</P>
<P>The relative effectiveness of the different nutritional strategies following head injury has been examined in a number of randomised controlled trials. To determine the best timing (early or delayed), and route (enteral or parenteral) of nutritional supplementation following head injury, a systematic review of randomised controlled trials was conducted.</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>To quantify the effect on mortality and morbidity of alternative strategies of providing nutritional support following head injury. Specifically, the effect of the timing and route of administration.</P>

<P>Seven trials were found which compared parenteral versus enteral nutrition. Because early support often involves parenteral nutrition, three of the seven trials are also included in the previous analyses.<BR/>Five of the trials reported mortality (<LINK REF="STD-Borzotta-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Borzotta 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chiarelli-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Chiarelli 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hadley-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Hadley 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rapp-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Rapp 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Young-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Young 1987</LINK>) (207 participants).

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>This systematic review summarises the evidence from randomised controlled trials of nutritional support following head injury. </P>
<P>Timing of nutritional support is strongly influenced by the type of feeding used. Parenteral nutritional was usually started between 24 and 72 hours of the injury, but mostly within 48 hours of the injury. In the case of enteral (nasogastric tube) feeding, nutritional support typically started much later when bowel sounds could be heard, usually between three and five days of injury. Jejunal enteral feeding, however, could be started earlier despite poor gastric emptying. This review addressed the timing and route of nutritional support. There was a trend towards improved survival and reduced disability with early support but the trials were small and the precision of the point estimates was low. </P>
<P>The pooled results from trials comparing parenteral and enteral nutrition suggested a trend towards better outcomes with parenteral nutrition, although again, the precision of the point estimates for mortality was low. In this comparison the trials by <LINK REF="STD-Hadley-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Hadley 1986</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Rapp-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Rapp 1983</LINK>, and <LINK REF="STD-Young-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Young 1987</LINK> used nasogastric tube feeding for the enteral arm of the trial, in which case the observed effects may be explained by the timing rather than the route of feeding. Two trials reported the effect of route of feeding on the incidence of infection of any type, but both trials showed a trend towards more infection with TPN than with EN. If valid, this might reflect catheter related infection with TPN. Three trials reported the effect of route of feeding on the occurrence of pneumonia, and there was a trend towards a reduction in incidence of pneumonia in the TPN group. </P>
<P>The focus of many of the trials included in this review was on nutritional outcomes, and many failed to report the effect of the alternative feeding strategies on death and disability. We wrote to all of the authors of the included trials in an attempt to obtain any unpublished outcome data, but many of the trialists could not be contacted. Because we were unable to obtain mortality and disability data for all of the included trials we cannot exclude the possibility of bias due to the selective publication of trial outcomes showing stronger treatment effects. Also the length of follow-up varied from two weeks to 12 months in those trials that did look at disability.</P>
<P>It would appear from this review that there have been few trials into nutritional support following head injury, which makes it hard for the clinician to make an evidence-based decision about nutritional support in head-injured patients. Overall the quality of the trials was poor. All of the trials had either inadequate or unclear allocation concealment and most had not attempted to do an intention to treat analysis. Indeed in some of the studies they admitted excluding from the final analysis patients who had died.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>The results of this review suggest that early feeding may be associated with fewer infections and a trend towards better outcomes in terms of survival and disability. However, the trials were small and consequently the precision of the point estimates was low.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Further trials of nutritional support following head injury are required. These trials should report not only nutritional outcomes but also outcomes such as death, disability, infectious complications and ICU and hospital length of stay. Trials should be large enough to detect modest but nevertheless clinically important treatment effects. </P>
