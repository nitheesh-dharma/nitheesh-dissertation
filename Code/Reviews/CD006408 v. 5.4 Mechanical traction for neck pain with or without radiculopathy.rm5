<SUMMARY>
<TITLE>Mechanical traction for neck pain with or without symptoms that radiate to the neck or arm</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Twenty-six to 71% of the adult population can recall experiencing an episode of neck pain or stiffness in their lifetime. Neck pain is more common in females than in males, with rates reported as high as 77.8%. The natural history is unclear. Neck pain has a costly impact on society because of visits to healthcare providers, sick leave, disability and loss of productivity. There are a number of treatments available for neck pain, one of which is mechanical traction. </P>
<P>Mechanical traction 'stretches' the neck. With the patient lying on their back, a head halter is placed under the back of the head and possibly the jaw and attached to a machine. The machine is set for a certain time period and specific weight for the pulling action to occur. The traction can remain on steadily for the specified time (referred to as continuous or static) or intermittently (on/off cycle) during the treatment session. Experts think that traction expands the space between the vertebrae, increases the movement of the joints and stretches the muscles and ligaments around the vertebrae. Side effects are generally few, but can include headache, nausea, fainting and injury to tissue.</P>
<P>We included seven randomized controlled trials (RCT), with a total of 958 participants, that looked at the effects of continuous or intermittent mechanical traction for individuals with chronic neck pain (lasting for more than three months). Some had symptoms that radiated into the arms and head (radicular symptoms), others did not. </P>
<P>Only one RCT (100 participants) had a low risk of bias, which means we can have confidence in the findings. This trial found that on average, there was no statistically significant difference between continuous and placebo traction in reducing pain or improving function for individuals with chronic neck disorder with radicular symptoms. </P>
<P>In summary, our review found no evidence from RCTs with a low potential for bias that clearly supports or refutes the use of either continuous or intermittent traction for individuals with chronic neck disorders.</P>

<P>Of the seven selected RCTs (total participants = 958), only one (N = 100) had a low risk of bias. It found no statistically significant difference (SMD -0.16: 95%CI: -0.59 to 0.27) between continuous traction and placebo traction in reducing pain or improving function for chronic neck disorders with radicular symptoms. Our review found no evidence from RCTs with a low potential for bias that clearly supports or refutes the use of either continuous or intermittent traction for neck disorders.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>The current literature does not support or refute the efficacy or effectiveness of continuous or intermittent traction for pain reduction, improved function or global perceived effect when compared to placebo traction, tablet or heat or other conservative treatments in patients with chronic neck disorders. Large, well conducted RCTs are needed to first determine the efficacy of traction, then the effectiveness, for individuals with neck disorders with radicular symptoms.<BR/>

<P>Neck pain is a frequently reported complaint of the musculoskeletal system which can be disabling and costly to society. The natural history of neck pain is unclear. Twenty-six to 71% of the adult population can recall experiencing an episode of neck pain or stiffness in their lifetime (<LINK REF="REF-Cote-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cote 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Makela-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Makela 1991</LINK>).

A U.S. study from the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey reported an average of 10.2 million visits to healthcare facilities for neck pain (<LINK REF="REF-Riddle-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Riddle 2007</LINK>). Neck pain has a large impact on health care expenditure, attributed to visits to health care providers, sick leave, disability and the related loss of productivity (<LINK REF="REF-Borghouts-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Borghouts 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hoving-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hoving 2001</LINK>). </P>
<P>Mechanical traction for the cervical spine involves a pulling force applied to the neck via a mechanical system which can be applied intermittently or continuously (<LINK REF="REF-Kisner-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kisner 1996</LINK>). It is often used as an adjunct therapy in outpatient rehabilitation (<LINK REF="REF-Michlovitz-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Michlovitz 2005</LINK>). The physiological effects of mechanical traction for the cervical spine may include separation of vertebral bodies, movement of facet joints, expansion of intervertebral foramen and stretching of soft tissue (<LINK REF="REF-Kisner-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kisner 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Michlovitz-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Michlovitz 2005</LINK>). Although traction may be a common treatment approach for neck pain, its effectiveness remains limited or inconclusive (<LINK REF="REF-Gross-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gross 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Graham-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Graham 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kjellman-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kjellman 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Peeters-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Peeters 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-van-der-Heijden-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">van der Heijden 1995</LINK>). <BR/>

<SEARCH_METHODS MODIFIED="2008-05-14 14:25:28 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>A research librarian searched computerized bibliographic databases, without language restrictions, for medical, chiropractic and allied health literature. Our search was part of a comprehensive search on patient education, manual therapies, drug therapies and physical medicine modalities in which mechanical traction is included. We searched the following databases from their beginnings to March 2008: CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library 2008, Issue 1), MEDLINE (January 1966 to March 2008), EMBASE (January 1980 to March 2008), Manual Alternative and Natural Therapy (1985 to March 2008), Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL: January 1982 to March 2008), and Index to Chiropractic Literature (1980 to March 2008). We also consulted personal files, screened references, and communicated with the Cochrane Back Review Group and content experts. Unpublished literature from specific conference proceedings was scanned by authors attending relevant society meetings. Subject headings (MeSH) and key words included anatomical terms, disorder or syndrome terms, treatment terms, and methodological terms, consistent with those recommended by the Cochrane Back Review Group (<LINK REF="REF-van-Tulder-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Tulder 2003</LINK>) (See Additional Table 1).</P>

<P>Two review authors with different backgrounds in medicine, physiotherapy, massage therapy and chiropractics independently conducted citation identification, study selection, and data abstraction using pre-piloted forms. We resolved disagreement through consensus. Prior to consensus, we calculated agreement between review authors for study selection using the Kappa statistic. Measures less than zero indicate poor agreement, 0 to 0.20 slight agreement, 0.21 to 0.40 fair agreement, 0.41 to 0.60 moderate agreement, 0.61 to 0.80 substantial agreement and 0.81 to 1.00 almost complete agreement (<LINK REF="REF-Landis-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Landis 1977</LINK>).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Assessment of Methodological Quality</HEADING>
<P>Two review authors independently assessed each selected study for risk of bias using (i) the Back Review Group's 11 criteria (<LINK REF="REF-van-Tulder-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Tulder 2003</LINK>) where an RCT was rated as high quality (low risk of bias) if six or more criteria were met (see Additional <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>): (ii) the validated 5-point <LINK REF="REF-Jadad-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jadad 1996</LINK> criteria where a high score is three or more out of five (see Additional <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>): and (iii) the Cochrane grading for concealment of allocation (A to D). The latter is reported in the <I>Characteristics of Included Studies </I>table.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Analysis of Trial Results</HEADING>
<P>We calculated standardized mean differences and 95% confidence intervals<I> </I>(SMD: 95%CI) for continuous outcomes using a random-effects model. SMD was used because different measures are frequently used to address the same clinical outcome. A random effects model incorporates the variability both within and between studies, and as a result has wider confidence limits, providing an appropriate level of caution for readers. Generally, an effect size can be interpreted as small (0.20), medium (0.50) or large (0.80), as defined by <LINK REF="REF-Cohen-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cohen 1988</LINK>. We selected 10-mm change in pain on a 100-point scale (10%) as the minimal clinically important difference (MCID) (<LINK REF="REF-Goldsmith-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goldsmith 1993</LINK>). A minimal clinically important difference of five neck disability index units on a 50-point scale (10%) has been established for the neck disability index (<LINK REF="REF-Stratford-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stratford 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>We calculated the relative risk (RR) for dichotomous outcomes. A RR less than one represents a beneficial treatment. When neither continuous nor dichotomous data were available, we noted the findings and the statistical significance as reported by the author(s) in the original RCT. Data from controlled trials did not permit calculation of the number-needed-to-treat (NNT) and treatment advantage for primary findings (<LINK REF="REF-Gross-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gross 2002</LINK>). However, the baseline mean, end of study mean, absolute benefit, RR, and SMD are noted in the <I>Characteristics of Included Studies </I>table<I>.</I> Power analyses was conducted for each article reporting non-significant findings (<LINK REF="REF-Dupont-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dupont 1990</LINK>). The desired level of significance was set at alpha equal to 0.05 and adequate power was defined as at least 80%.<I> </I>Although power analyses is most appropriate a priori for estimating sample size, we felt that the level of insufficiency determined through a post-hoc power analyses was useful.<BR/>
<BR/>Prior to calculation of a pooled effect measure, a multidisciplinary team examined the reasonableness of pooling on clinical and biological grounds. If at least two trials were clinically homogeneous, we considered pooling their results. These possible sources of heterogeneity that were considered are:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>participant differences;</LI>
<LI>symptom duration (acute versus chronic);</LI>
<LI>subtype of neck disorder (especially WAD), intervention type (continuous, intermittent traction);</LI>
<LI>characteristics of treatment (eg. dosage, technique); and</LI>
<LI>outcomes (pain reduction, measures of function and disability, employment status, patient satisfaction, quality of life).</LI>
</UL>
<P>Methodological study quality was also considered as a possible source of heterogeneity. Although sensitivity analysis and meta-regression were planned to explore the relationship between these key characteristics, they could not be performed due to insufficient data. <I>

<BR/>Regardless of whether there were sufficient data available to use quantitative analyses to summarize the data, we assessed the overall quality of the evidence for each outcome. To accomplish this, we used the GRADE approach, as recommended by the Back Review Group (<LINK REF="REF-Furlan-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Furlan 2008</LINK>). The quality of the evidence for a specific outcome was based on the study design, risk of bias, consistency of results, directness (generalizability), precision (sufficient data) and reporting of the results across all studies that measure that particular outcome. The quality was considered <I>high</I> when RCTs with low risk of bias provided consistent, direct and precise results for the outcome, and reduced by a level for each of the domains not met.</P>
<P>
<B>High quality evidence</B> = there are consistent findings among 75% (at least two high quality) of the RCTs with low potential for bias that are generalizable to the population in question. There are sufficient data, with narrow confidence intervals. There are no known or suspected reporting biases.<BR/>
<B>Moderate quality evidence</B> = one of the domains is not met<BR/>
<B>Low quality evidence</B> = two of the domains are not met<BR/>
<B>Very low quality evidence</B> = three of the domains are not met<BR/>
<B>No evidence</B> = no evidence from RCTs<BR/>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Risk of Bias assessment of included RCTs</HEADING>
<P>Overall, our selected RCTs were rated as having a high risk of bias using either the 11 criteria listed in <LINK REF="REF-van-Tulder-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Tulder 2003</LINK> (Mean 4.1, S.D. 1.9) or the 5 items listed in <LINK REF="REF-Jadad-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jadad 1996</LINK> (Mean 2, S.D. 1.1). The major risk of bias were: inadequate or poorly described concealment of allocation (reported in 0/7) and methods of randomization (reported in 1/7), blinding of patients, care providers and outcome assessors was poor in all but one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Klaber-Moffett-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Klaber Moffett 1990</LINK>) and intention-to-treat analyses were not included. Most RCTs (6/7) had appropriately accounted for withdrawals and dropouts appropriately (see <LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK> and <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK> for risk of bias assessments).

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Risk of Bias</HEADING>
<P>Overall, high risk of bias in the primary RCTs limited this review. Only one RCT (<LINK REF="STD-Klaber-Moffett-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Klaber Moffett 1990</LINK>) was rated as having a low risk of bias using both the van Tulder and Jadad scales. Blinding, concealment of allocation and methods of randomization were either not adequate or poorly described and analyses did not include intention-to-treat. Follow-up and drop-out rates were described well and considered acceptable in all but one study (<LINK REF="STD-Kogstad-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Kogstad 1978</LINK>). A point can be made however, that five of the seven included RCTs were published from 1966 to 1990 when reporting guidelines were different than today's standards.<BR/>
<BR/>With many rehabilitation interventions, blinding of patients becomes an issue. It may not be feasible to blind subjects, since even with "placebo" traction, they may be able to tell if a force was being applied. If subjects sense there is no pull, they may not feel that their symptoms will improve and this may increase the potential for bias. Many of the outcomes assessed are self-reports, therefore the patient is the outcome assessor and is unable to be blinded.<BR/>
<BR/>Due to heterogeneity of disorder types, interventions and outcomes, we were unable to pool the results. However, when continuous traction was compared to three different placebos for chronic neck disorders with radicular symptoms, two RCTs separately demonstrated similar findings for the effect of traction on pain, function and disability (<LINK REF="STD-Brewerton-1966" TYPE="STUDY">Brewerton 1966</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Klaber-Moffett-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Klaber Moffett 1990</LINK>). Since both RCTs were underpowered and <LINK REF="STD-Brewerton-1966" TYPE="STUDY">Brewerton 1966</LINK> was rated as having a high risk of bias, these results would need to be confirmed through larger, better conducted RCTs.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Comparison against other review findings</HEADING>
<P>Three other reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Kjellman-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kjellman 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-van-der-Heijden-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">van der Heijden 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Verhagen-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Verhagen 2004</LINK>) showed that either no clear conclusions could be drawn or there was no benefit of traction for neck disorders. This is consistent with lumbar traction reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Clarke-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clarke 2007</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Pellecchia-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pellecchia 1994</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-van-der-Heijden-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">van der Heijden 1995</LINK>). Our previous review (<LINK REF="REF-Graham-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Graham 2006</LINK>) reported one positive clinical conclusion - that intermittent traction may be favourable for chronic neck disorders with or without radicular symptoms for short-term pain relief - but this review included quasi-RCTs with high risks of bias. We agree that standardization of traction dosage and clinical parameters have not been clearly reported and high risk of bias identified in this current review affects our confidence in the results.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Adverse events and cost of care</HEADING>
<P>Cost of care and rates of adverse events could not be determined with these data. Clearly, there is inadequacy in reporting these data. Authors should follow CONSORT guidelines to standardize RCT reporting.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Other Methodological Issues</HEADING>
<P>'Selection bias' was not likely to be present in our review. We used pairs of independent review authors from diverse professional backgrounds to select the studies. We did not search non-English databases, so 'Language bias' may be present in this review. Although unpublished work was sought through conference proceedings, personal files and grey literature, we did not search all databases for unpublished work nor did we write authors or agencies to elicit unpublished work, therefore 'Publication bias' was not completely guarded against either. Using the GRADE approach for single studies and developing a forest plot for one study may be excessive and does not provide added value to the results.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>The current literature does not support or refute the efficacy or effectiveness of continuous or intermittent traction for pain reduction, improved function or global perceived effect over placebo traction, tablet or heat or other conservative treatments in patients with chronic neck disorders. </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Large, well conducted RCTs are needed that evaluate the effect of traction as an adjunct treatment in rehabilitation.</P>

<P>The van Tulder et al criteria and scores are as follows:<BR/>(Total Score 11; high quality =6)<BR/>
<BR/>Was the method of randomisation adequate? A random (unpredictable) assignment sequence. Examples of adequate methods are computer-generated random numbers table and use of sealed opaque envelopes. Methods of allocation using date of birth, date of admission, hospital numbers, or alternation should not be regarded as appropriate.<BR/>
<BR/>Was the treatment allocation concealed? Assignment generated by an independent person not responsible for determining the eligibility of the patients. This person has no information about the persons included in the trial and has no influence on the assignment sequence or on the decision about eligibility of the patient.<BR/>
<BR/>Was the patient blinded to the intervention? The review author determines if enough information about the blinding is given in order to score a "yes."<BR/>
<BR/>Was the care provider blinded to the intervention? The review author determines if enough information about the blinding is given in order to score a "yes."<BR/>
<BR/>Was the outcome assessor blinded to the intervention? The review author determines if enough information about the blinding is given in order to score a "yes."<BR/>
<BR/>Was the drop-out rate described and acceptable? The number of participants who were included in the study but did not complete the observation period or were not included in the analysis must be described and reasons given. If the percentage of withdrawals and drop-outs does not exceed 20% for immediate and short-term follow-ups, 30% for intermediate and long-term follow-ups and does not lead to substantial bias a "yes" is scored.<BR/>
<BR/>Did the analysis include an intention-to-treat analysis? All randomized patients are reported/analyzed in the group to which they were allocated by randomization for the most important moments of effect measurement (minus missing values), irrespective of noncompliance and co-interventions.<BR/>
<BR/>Were the groups similar at baseline regarding the most important prognostic indicators? In order to receive a "yes," groups have to be similar at baseline regarding demographic factors, duration and severity of complaints, percentage of patients with neurological symptoms, and value of main outcome measure(s).<BR/>
<BR/>Were co-interventions avoided or similar? Co-interventions should either be avoided in the trial design or be similar between the index and control groups.<BR/>
<BR/>Was the compliance acceptable in all groups? The review author determines if the compliance to the interventions is acceptable, based on the reported intensity, duration, number and frequency of sessions for both the index intervention and control intervention(s).<BR/>
<BR/>Was the timing of the outcome assessment in all groups similar? Timing of outcome assessment should be identical for all intervention groups and for all important outcome assessments.<BR/>

(Score 1 if yes);<BR/>2b and 2c. Was the method of double blinding described and appropriate to maintain double blinding? (Score 1 if appropriate and -1 if not appropriate);<BR/>3.
