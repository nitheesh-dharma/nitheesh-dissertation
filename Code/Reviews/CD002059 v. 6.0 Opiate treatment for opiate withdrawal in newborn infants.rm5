<P>An opiate such as morphine or dilute tincture of opium should probably be used as initial treatment to ameliorate withdrawal symptoms in newborn infants with an opiate withdrawal due to maternal opiate use in pregnancy. Use of opiates (commonly prescribed methadone or illicit heroin) by pregnant women may result in a withdrawal syndrome in their newborn infants. This may result in disruption of the mother-infant relationship, sleeping and feeding difficulties, weight loss and seizures. Treatments for newborn infants used to ameliorate these symptoms and reduce complications include opiates, sedatives (phenobarbitone or diazepam) and supportive treatments (swaddling, settling, massage, relaxation baths, pacifiers or waterbeds). Trials of opiates compared to sedatives or other non-pharmacological treatments have generally been of poor quality. Individual trials have reported that using an opiate compared to phenobarbitone may reduce the incidence of seizures, duration of treatment and nursery admission rate. However, no overall effect was found on treatment failure rate. When compared to diazepam, opiates reduced the incidence of treatment failure. Opiates such as morphine or dilute tincture of opium should probably be used as initial treatment for opiate withdrawal in newborn infants.</P>

<P>Opiates compared to supportive care may reduce time to regain birth weight and duration of supportive care but increase duration of hospital stay. When compared to phenobarbitone, opiates may reduce the incidence of seizures but there is no evidence of effect on treatment failure. One study reported a reduction in duration of treatment and nursery admission for infants on morphine. Compared to diazepam, opiates reduce the incidence of treatment failure. A post-hoc analysis generates the hypothesis that initial opiate treatment may be restricted to infants of mothers who used opiates only. In view of the methodologic limitations of the included studies the conclusions of this review should be treated with caution.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2010-09-08 12:38:03 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Opiate use in pregnancy and neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) due to opiate withdrawal is currently a significant clinical and social problem. The US 1999 National Household Survey on Drug Abuse (<LINK REF="REF-NHSDA-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">NHSDA 1999</LINK>) estimated that 39.7% of individuals over 12 years had ever used an illicit drug, with heroin use reported by 1.4%. Current illicit drug use (within last month) was reported by 6.7% (14.8 million people) and heroin by 0.1% (200,000 people). Rates of illicit drug use were almost half during pregnancy, with 3.4% of pregnant women reporting use of an illicit drug in the past month. This represents an estimated 3,000 pregnant women who are current users of heroin in the US. These rates are similar to Australian data (<LINK REF="REF-NDSHS-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">NDSHS 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>Between 48% and 94% of infants exposed to opiates in utero develop clinical signs of withdrawal, with signs of withdrawal from methadone being more common than from heroin (<LINK REF="STD-Alroomi-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Alroomi 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Doberczak-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Doberczak 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fricker-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fricker 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lam-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lam 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Maas-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maas 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Madden-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Madden 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Olofsson-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Olofsson 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ostrea-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Ostrea 1976</LINK>). There is some evidence to correlate methadone dose and severity of withdrawal (<LINK REF="STD-Doberczak-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Doberczak 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Harper-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Harper 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ostrea-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Ostrea 1976</LINK>). Clinically significant manifestations of withdrawal are uncommon if the methadone dose is below 20 mg/day (<LINK REF="REF-Strauss-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Strauss 1976</LINK>). The onset of features of withdrawal from heroin tends to begin within 24 hours after birth and clinical manifestations are usually mild (<LINK REF="STD-Alroomi-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Alroomi 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bell-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bell 1995</LINK>), whereas withdrawal from methadone usually begins between two and seven days after birth (<LINK REF="STD-Doberczak-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Doberczak 1991</LINK>) and may be delayed up to a month (<LINK REF="REF-Kandall-1974" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kandall 1974</LINK>). Clinical features of neonatal opiate abstinence syndrome include neurological excitability, gastrointestinal dysfunction and autonomic signs (<LINK REF="REF-AAP-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">AAP 1998</LINK>). There may be poor feeding, sleep-wake abnormalities (<LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Brien-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Brien 2002</LINK>), vomiting, dehydration, poor weight gain and seizures. In addition, infants of mothers using illicit drugs may be at increased risk of neonatal mortality (<LINK REF="REF-Hulse-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hulse 1998</LINK>), sudden infant death syndrome (<LINK REF="REF-Kandall-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kandall 1993</LINK>), and abnormal neurodevelopmental outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-de-Cubas-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">de Cubas 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ornoy-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ornoy 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>Seizures occur in 2% to 11% of infants withdrawing from opiates (<LINK REF="STD-Herzlinger-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Herzlinger 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kandall-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Kandall 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Doberczak-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Doberczak 1991</LINK>) and may be more common with methadone than heroin withdrawal (<LINK REF="STD-Herzlinger-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Herzlinger 1977</LINK>). Although there is evidence in animals that withdrawal from opiates and opiate antagonists is eleptogenic (<LINK REF="REF-Olson-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Olson 1997</LINK>), there is little evidence that this is the case in humans. Case series of infants with neonatal opiate withdrawal in whom seizures have been reported (<LINK REF="STD-Herzlinger-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Herzlinger 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kandall-1974" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kandall 1974</LINK>) have not systematically controlled for maternal use of other drugs throughout pregnancy or reported seizures in infants exposed to only opiates in utero.</P>
<P>The American Academy of Pediatrics (<LINK REF="REF-AAP-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">AAP 1998</LINK>) recommends that for infants with confirmed drug exposure the indications for drug therapy should be seizures, poor feeding, diarrhoea and vomiting resulting in excessive weight loss and dehydration, inability to sleep and fever unrelated to infection. An abstinence score such as the Lipsitz tool (<LINK REF="REF-Lipsitz-1975" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lipsitz 1975</LINK>), Neonatal Abstinence Scoring System (<LINK REF="STD-Finnegan-1975a" TYPE="STUDY">Finnegan 1975a</LINK>) and Neonatal Withdrawal Inventory (<LINK REF="REF-Zahorodny-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zahorodny 1998</LINK>) may document significant manifestations of withdrawal. Although the validity of these scoring systems is not proven, they may provide more objective criteria for assessing infants and deciding on treatment. When pharmacological treatment is chosen, the AAP recommends that for opiate withdrawal tincture of opium is the preferred drug. For sedative-hypnotic withdrawal, phenobarbitone is the agent of choice.</P>
<P>Opiates used for NAS due to opiate withdrawal have included tincture of opium, paregoric (contains anhydrous morphine with antispasmodics, camphor, 45% ethanol and benzoic acid), morphine, and methadone. Sedatives used for opiate withdrawal have included clonidine (an alpha2 presynaptic blocker), chlorpromazine, phenobarbitone and diazepam (<LINK REF="REF-Theis-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Theis 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-AAP-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">AAP 1998</LINK>). Non-pharmacological treatments used have included swaddling, settling, massage, relaxation baths, pacifiers and waterbeds (<LINK REF="REF-Oro-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oro 1988</LINK>).</P>
<P>The question to be addressed by this review is: what is the evidence, from random and quasi-random controlled trials, that an opiate is better than a sedative or non-pharmacological treatment of clinically significant NAS due to opiate withdrawal? The goal of treatment should be to provide comfort to the mother and infant in relieving symptoms, improve feeding and weight gain, prevent seizures, reduce unnecessary hospitalisation, improve mother-infant interaction and reduce the incidence of infant mortality and abnormal neurodevelopment. This is an update of a previous review (<LINK REF="REF-Osborn-2002a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Osborn 2002a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Osborn-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Osborn 2005</LINK>). A separate review (<LINK REF="REF-Osborn-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Osborn 2010</LINK>) examines the evidence for the use of sedatives in infants with NAS due to opiate withdrawal.</P>

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2010-09-08 14:27:44 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The methodological quality of each trial was reviewed independently by the three authors for the 2002 review. DO performed the 2010 update. Particular emphasis was placed on allocation concealment, blinding, completeness of follow-up and blinding of outcome assessment. Allocation concealment was ranked: Grade A: adequate; Grade B: uncertain; Grade C: clearly inadequate. Additional information, where required, was requested from authors of each trial to clarify methodology.</P>
<P>For the update in 2010, the authors assessed the risk of bias for each study using the criteria outlined in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<B>(1) Sequence generation (checking for possible selection bias)</B>
</P>
<P>For each included study, we described the method used to generate the allocation sequence in sufficient detail to allow an assessment of whether it should produce comparable groups. We assessed the method as:<BR/>&#8226; adequate (any truly random process, e.g. random number table; computer random number generator);<BR/>&#8226; inadequate (any non random process, e.g. odd or even date of birth; hospital or clinic record number);<BR/>&#8226; unclear.</P>
<P>
<B>(2) Allocation concealment (checking for possible selection bias)</B>
</P>
<P>For each included study, we described the method used to conceal the allocation sequence in sufficient detail and determine whether intervention allocation could have been foreseen in advance of, or during recruitment, or changed after assignment.<BR/>We assessed the methods as:<BR/>&#8226; adequate (e.g. telephone or central randomisation; consecutively numbered sealed opaque envelopes);<BR/>&#8226; inadequate (open random allocation; unsealed or non opaque envelopes, alternation; date of birth);<BR/>&#8226; unclear.</P>
<P>
<B>(3) Blinding (checking for possible performance bias)</B>
</P>
<P>For each included study, we described the methods used, if any, to blind study participants and personnel from knowledge of which intervention a participant received. We judged studies to be at low risk of bias if they were blinded, or if we judged that the lack of blinding could not have affected the results. We assessed blinding separately for different outcomes or classes of outcomes.<BR/>We assessed the methods as:<BR/>&#8226; adequate, inadequate or unclear for participants;<BR/>&#8226; adequate, inadequate or unclear for personnel;<BR/>&#8226; adequate, inadequate or unclear for outcome assessors.</P>
<P>
<B>(4) Incomplete outcome data (checking for possible attrition bias through withdrawals, dropouts, protocol deviations)</B>
</P>
<P>For each included study and for each outcome or class of outcomes, we described the completeness of data including attrition and exclusions from the analysis. We stated whether attrition and exclusions were reported, the numbers included in the analysis at each stage (compared with the total randomised participants), reasons for attrition or exclusion where reported, and whether missing data were balanced across groups or were related to outcomes.<BR/>Where sufficient information is reported or can be supplied by the trial authors, we re-included missing data in the analyses. We assessed methods as:<BR/>&#8226; adequate (less than 20% missing data);<BR/>&#8226; inadequate;<BR/>&#8226; unclear.</P>
<P>
<B>(5) Outcome reporting bias</B>
</P>
<P>For each included study, we described how we investigated the possibility of selective outcome reporting bias and what we found.<BR/>We assessed the methods as:<BR/>&#8226; adequate (where it is clear that all of the study&#8217;s prespecified outcomes and all expected outcomes of interest to the review have been reported);<BR/>&#8226; inadequate (where not all the study&#8217;s pre-specified outcomes have been reported; one or more reported primary outcomes were not pre-specified; outcomes of interest are reported incompletely and so cannot be used; study fails to include results of a key outcome that would have been expected to have been reported);<BR/>&#8226; unclear.</P>
<P>
<B>(6) Other sources of bias</B>
</P>
<P>For each included study, we described any important concerns we had about other possible sources of bias (e.g. early termination of trial due to data-dependant process, extreme baseline imbalance, etc). We assessed whether each study was free of other problems that could put it at risk of bias. We assessed other sources of bias as:<BR/>&#8226; yes;<BR/>&#8226; no;<BR/>&#8226; unclear.</P>
<P>
<B>(7) Overall risk of bias</B>
</P>
<P>We made explicit judgements about whether studies are at high risk of bias, according to the criteria given in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2009</LINK>). With reference to (1) and (6) above, we assessed the likely magnitude and direction of the bias and whether we consider it is likely to impact on the findings. We explored the impact of the level of bias through undertaking sensitivity analyses - see 'Sensitivity analysis&#8217;.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Carin-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Carin 1983</LINK> enrolled infants born to mothers receiving methadone for more than three months. Infants were enrolled if the Finnegan score was &#8805; 8. Polydrug use was disclosed by some mothers (see 'table of included studies'). Infants were randomly allocated to paregoric 0.42 to 2.1 ml/kg/day orally or phenobarbitone 5 to 16 mg/kg/day in three divided doses titrated to symptom severity.

Data were reported for infants of mothers a) using only opiates and b) using opiates and another drug. This stratification was not prespecified (author communication). The Neonatal Abstinence Scoring System (Finnegan score) was used to determine need and response to treatment. Infants were allocated to paregoric titrated to score (dose not reported), phenobarbitone loading dose regimen (20 mg/kg with maintenance 5 to 10 mg/kg/day) titrated against scores, phenobarbitone titration regimen (no loading dose), or diazepam (dose not reported) depending on scores.

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2010-08-10 12:16:29 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Opiate versus supportive care: This review finds limited evidence from one quasi-random study that morphine and supportive care compared to supportive care alone does not affect treatment failure rate, but results in a significant reduction in time to regain birthweight and duration of supportive care at the cost of increased hospital stay. It is unclear whether the effect on duration of hospital stay was due to a policy of keeping the infants in hospital whilst receiving pharmacological therapy.</P>
<P>Opiate versus phenobarbitone: there is conflicting evidence whether use of an opiate results in a reduction of treatment failure for infants with opiate withdrawal. Meta-analysis of four studies found no significant difference in treatment failure. One study not included in the meta-analysis due to concerns regarding duplicate publication reported a significant reduction in treatment failure. The only study to report infants of mothers using only an opiate separately reported a significant reduction in treatment failure in infants treated with an opiate, but an increase in treatment failure in infants exposed to multiple drugs. The significance of the finding of one study reporting seizures in infants receiving phenobarbitone is unclear. No other study has reported this finding. One study incorporating blinding of treatment reported a significant reduction in special care nursery admission with use of morphine compared to phenobarbitone. The significance of this finding is unclear as there was no dose titration used. However, a relatively low dose of morphine was used (0.2 mg/kg/day) compared to a moderate dose of phenobarbitone (8mg/kg/day).</P>
<P>Opiate versus diazepam: meta-analysis of two studies found a significant reduction in treatment failure for infants treated with an opiate compared to diazepam, One of these studies reported this benefit was significant for infants born to mothers using only opiates, but not those using opiates and other drugs. No other outcomes were significantly different.</P>
<P>Specific opiate versus other opiate: two studies compared different opiates. One small pilot study comparing sublingual buprenorphine versus tincture of opium reported no significant difference in treatment failure or days treatment, one infant receiving buprenorphine had a seizure and infants receiving buprenorphine had a significant reduction in duration of hospital stay. However, 35.6% of buprenorphine samples were below the limits of quantification and 98% below 0.6 ng/ml, the therapeutic level reported for management of adult opioid replacement therapy. Given that the majority of treatment failure occurred in the sublingual buprenorphine group and apparently subtherapeutic levels were reported, the safety and efficacy of sublingual buprenorphine has not been confirmed. Another small study compared morphine to tincture of opium and reported no significant difference in maximum Finnegan score, area under the curve for the Finnegan score above 8 and weight gain per day during the therapy phase. Treatment failure and seizures were not reported.</P>
<P>Specific opiate versus specific sedative: Meta-analysis of two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Jackson-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Jackson 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Khoo-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Khoo 1995</LINK>) comparing morphine and phenobarbitone found a significant reduction in treatment failure of borderline statistical significance. No significant difference in treatment failure rate were found for paregoric versus phenobarbitone, or methadone versus phenobarbitone.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2010-04-06 04:08:25 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review includes studies that report random or quasi-random allocation of infants with NAS to a sedative or non-opiate control. Given the high rate of polydrug use in mothers of infants with NAS, the infants included in these studies are likely to represent the infants seen in clinical practice. However, few data are presented that differentiate response to treatment of infants of mothers using only opiates separately from those exposed to opiate using mothers with polydrug use. Only one study comparing use of an opiate versus a sedative (<LINK REF="STD-Finnegan-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Finnegan 1984</LINK>) differentiated infants of mothers only using opiates to those born to mothers on an opiate and another drug, although this was not prespecified. Two studies comparing different types of opiates enrolled infants of mothers using only opiates (<LINK REF="STD-Kraft-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Kraft 2009</LINK>) or with infrequent other drug use (<LINK REF="STD-Langenfeld-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Langenfeld 2005</LINK>). No study reported quality of mother-infant interaction, success of breast feeding, incidence of foster care or neurodevelopmental outcome (according to group of allocation). Most studies used a standardised score to determine need for treatment and response to treatment although few studies reported withdraw severity data that could be included in the review.</P>
<P>The initial dose of opiate and sedative varied between studies, with several studies using low initial doses of opiate and one study not titrating dose of morphine. Differences in treatment regimens has the potential to substantially affect the generalisability of this review.</P>
<P>The studies are insufficiently powered to detect important differences in treatment failure rate between different treatments.</P>

<P>The validity of the results is affected by the methodological quality of the included studies. Three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Jackson-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Jackson 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kraft-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Kraft 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Langenfeld-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Langenfeld 2005</LINK>) reported adequate randomisation and allocation concealment procedures. However, one of these studies (<LINK REF="STD-Jackson-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Jackson 2004</LINK>) had an imbalance after randomisation that resulted in significantly more infants in the phenobarbitone group whose mothers were on benzodiazepines, which has the potential to bias the results. The other two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Kraft-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Kraft 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Langenfeld-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Langenfeld 2005</LINK>) compared different types of opiates with only one of these studies (<LINK REF="STD-Langenfeld-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Langenfeld 2005</LINK>) reporting a blinded comparison. Three studies reported quasi-random methods of patient allocation and the other studies failed to report method of random allocation. Several studies had large discrepancies in group allocations. Two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Jackson-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Jackson 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Langenfeld-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Langenfeld 2005</LINK>) reported blinding of treatment and only three studies reported blinding of outcome measurement. Communication with the author of two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Finnegan-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Finnegan 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kaltenbach-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Kaltenbach 1986</LINK>) has revealed that the studies may be sequential reports including some of the same patients. Original data are not available. The outcomes of these studies were not combined in meta-analysis. Few losses to follow up were reported by the individual studies, although this could have been by omission. In view of these limitations, the conclusions of this review should be treated with caution.</P>

<P>The review searched for published and unpublished studies in an attempt to avoid publication bias. The review included studies using quasi-random patient allocation increasing the risk of selection bias in the studies included in the review. This has been addressed using sensitivity analysis.

<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2009-10-24 07:37:33 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>Opiates, as compared to supportive care only, appear to reduce the time to regain birth weight and reduce the duration of supportive care, but increase the duration of hospital stay; there is no evidence of effect on treatment failure. When compared to phenobarbitone, opiates may reduce the incidence of seizures but, overall, there is no evidence of effect on treatment failure. One study reported a reduction in duration of treatment and nursery admission for infants on morphine. When compared to diazepam, opiates reduce the incidence of treatment failure. A post-hoc analysis generates the hypothesis that treatment effects may vary according to whether the population includes infants born to all opiate users (i.e. with or without other drug exposure) or is restricted to infants of mothers who used opiates only. In view of the methodologic limitations of the included studies the conclusions of this review should be treated with caution.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2009-10-24 07:37:33 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In infants of mothers using only opiates, further well designed studies are required to determine which opiate is most effective and what treatment threshold should be used. Studies should measure effects on infant signs of withdrawal, quality of mother-infant interaction, growth and long term development. Objective and validated infant symptom severity scores should be used. Trials should stratify randomisation of infants according to whether they were born to mothers using only opiates or using opiates and another drug. In infants of mothers using an opiate and another drug, further trials of an opiate versus phenobarbitone or opiate combined with a sedative are warranted. Trials of different thresholds for initiating pharmacological treatment, different initial doses of opiate and different titration regimens are needed. </P>
