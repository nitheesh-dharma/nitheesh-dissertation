<SUMMARY>
<TITLE>Still awaiting evidence on efficacy of medicinal herbs for viral hepatitis C</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Hepatitis C is an infectious disease of the liver caused by hepatitis C virus. Around 170 million people world-wide are chronically infected with this virus. The infection is associated with severe sequelae such as liver cirrhosis, liver cancer, or liver failure. Herbal medicines have been used for treating hepatitis C. This systematic review evaluates the effects of herbal medicines for treating acute and chronic hepatitis C infection.</P>
<P>Ten different herbal medicines were tested in ten randomised trials in patients with chronic hepatitis C. The present systematic review found no significant antiviral effect of the herbal medicines when compared with placebo, but the data suggest that some herbal medicines in combination with interferon may have effects on the clearance of HCV RNA and on normalisation of liver enzymes. However, there is no strong evidence for any efficacy of these medicinal herbs for chronic hepatitis C due to the fact that most positive effects came from clinical trials with low methodological quality. Medicinal herbs for hepatitis C virus infection should not be used outside well-designed, randomised clinical trials.</P>

<P>Two authors extracted data independently.

</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Ten randomised trials, including 517 patients with mainly chronic hepatitis C, evaluated ten different medicinal herbs versus various control interventions (four placebo, four interferon, two other herbs). The methodological quality was considered adequate in four trials and inadequate in six trials. Compared with placebo in four trials, none of the medicinal herbs showed positive effects on clearance of serum HCV RNA or anti-HCV antibody or on serum liver enzymes, except one short-term trial in which a silybin preparation showed a significant effect on reducing serum aspartate aminotransferase and gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase activities. The herbal compound Bing Gan Tang combined with interferon-alpha showed significantly better effects on clearance of serum HCV RNA (relative risk 2.54; 95% confidence interval 1.43 to 4.49) and on normalisation of serum alanine aminotransferase activity (relative risk 2.54; 95% confidence interval 1.43 to 4.49) than interferon-alpha monotherapy. The herbal compound Yi Zhu decoction showed a significant effect on clearance of serum HCV RNA and normalisation of ALT levels compared to glycyrrhizin plus ribavirin. Yi Er Gan Tang showed a significant effect on normalising serum alanine aminotransferase compared to silymarin plus glucurolactone. There was no significant efficacy of the other examined herbs. The herbs were associated with adverse events.</P>

<P>There is no firm evidence of efficacy of any medicinal herbs for HCV infection. Medicinal herbs for HCV infection should not be used outside randomised clinical trials.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-10-13 15:37:45 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Hepatitis C is an infectious disease of the liver caused by the hepatitis C virus (HCV) (<LINK REF="REF-Choo-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Choo 1989</LINK>). Currently, an estimated 170 million persons world-wide are chronically infected with HCV (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1997</LINK>). HCV infection may be self-limited (viral clearance) or persist (<LINK REF="REF-Farci-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Farci 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Alter-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alter 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Villano-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Villano 1999</LINK>). Viral clearance occurs in approximately 15% of persons and is assumed to have occurred when HCV RNA is undetectable in multiple blood samples from someone with HCV-specific antibodies (anti-HCV) or in whom acute infection was observed (<LINK REF="REF-Alter-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alter 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Barrera-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barrera 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Villano-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Villano 1999</LINK>). About 85% develop persistent HCV infection in which the virus continues to replicate and remains in their blood lifelong (<LINK REF="REF-Alter-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alter 1997</LINK>). Some studies suggest that cirrhosis of the liver develops in about 20% of patients with chronic hepatitis C within 20 years (<LINK REF="REF-Tremolada-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tremolada 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Poynard-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Poynard 1997</LINK>) and once cirrhosis is established, one-fourth of them will ultimately suffer from liver cancer or liver failure (<LINK REF="REF-Hoofnagle-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hoofnagle 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Poynard-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Poynard 1997</LINK>). However, other studies suggest that chronic HCV infection may have a much better prognosis (<LINK REF="REF-Thomas-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thomas 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Seeff-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Seeff 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Brok-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brok 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>HCV is a small (40-60 nm in diameter), enveloped, single-stranded RNA virus of the family Flaviviridae. Because the virus mutates rapidly, changes in the envelope protein may help it evade the immune system. The virus is spread primarily by contact with infected blood and blood products. It is also transmitted by sexual contact and from mother to infant. The transmission from HCV infected mother to new-born may occur in five per cent of at risk deliveries. With the implementation of anti-HCV screening in blood donors, the risk of post-transfusion hepatitis C has been dramatically reduced, but the infection continues to occur via other modes of apparent or unapparent parenteral transmission.</P>
<P>Presently, the most effective therapy for chronic hepatitis C is combination therapy with alpha interferon (IFN) and ribavirin (<LINK REF="REF-Brok-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brok 2005</LINK>). However, this intervention has only been demonstrated to have an effect on virological, biochemical, and histological responses. We do not yet know whether the effects on these surrogate outcome measures can be turned into patient relevant outcomes such as cirrhosis morbidity, quality-of-life, and increased survival (<LINK REF="REF-Brok-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brok 2005</LINK>). Furthermore, IFN and ribavirin are connected with a plethora of adverse events such as anorexia, nausea, dry skin, and leukopenia and are costly (<LINK REF="REF-Brok-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brok 2005</LINK>). Therefore, new medications and approaches to treatment are needed. Complementary therapies are being used increasingly (<LINK REF="REF-Eisenberg-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eisenberg 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vickers-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vickers 2000</LINK>). The number of randomised trials of complementary treatments has doubled every five years, and the Cochrane Library now includes nearly 50 systematic reviews of complementary medicine interventions (<LINK REF="REF-Vickers-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vickers 2000</LINK>). Many people turn to this therapy when conventional medicine fails them or they believe strongly in the effectiveness of complementary medicine.</P>
<P>Medicinal herbs are defined in this review as products derived from plants or parts of plants used for treatment of diseases. Some clinical trials have shown that medicinal herbs might have therapeutic potential for chronic liver diseases, including chronic hepatitis C (<LINK REF="REF-Zuin-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zuin 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ferenci-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ferenci 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Arase-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Arase 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Hara-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Hara 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rossum-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rossum 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Philipp-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Philipp 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wang-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wang 2000</LINK>). On the other hand, there is an increasing number of reports in the medical literature about liver toxicity and other adverse events from some herbal products (<LINK REF="REF-Melchart-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Melchart 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ishizaki-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ishizaki 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gottieb-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gottieb 2000</LINK>). Accordingly, this is another area that needs further research and systematic evaluation.</P>

<P>Male or female patients, of any age or ethnic origin, who had HCV infection (including acute and chronic HCV infection). Acute hepatitis C is diagnosed on the basis of symptoms such as jaundice, fatigue, and nausea, along with marked increases in serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and presence of anti-HCV or de novo development of anti-HCV. The diagnosis is confirmed by the finding of HCV RNA in serum. Chronic hepatitis C is diagnosed by elevated or recurrent fluctuating serum ALT levels and HCV RNA positivity lasting more than six months with or without symptoms, and with or without liver biopsy confirmation. Trials in populations with coinfection of HCV with human immune deficiency virus were excluded, but patients co infected with hepatitis B were included.</P>
</CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>Medicinal herbs were compared with no intervention, placebo, non-specific interventions like vitamins, other medicinal herbs, or IFN (no limitation regarding IFN type or treatment regimen) and/or ribavirin. Trials of medicinal herbs plus IFN and/or ribavirin versus IFN and/or ribavirin alone were also included. Co-interventions were allowed as long as both arms of the randomised allocation received the same co-intervention(s). <BR/>
</P>
</CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<CRIT_OUTCOMES>
<P>The primary outcome measures sought at the end of treatment and at maximal follow-up after completion of the treatment were:<BR/>- mortality (total and liver related);<BR/>- liver fibrosis, liver cirrhosis, and/or liver cancer;<BR/>- viral response, defined as loss of detectable HCV RNA (and/or serum anti-HCV) measured by validated methods such as polymerase chain reaction assay and second- or third-generation enzyme immunosorbent assay or recombinant immunoblot assay (<LINK REF="REF-Farrell-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Farrell 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>The secondary outcome measures were:<BR/>- biochemical response, defined as decrease or normalisation of serum ALT or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels;<BR/>- histological response, improvement of histology assessed by histological activity index and fibrosis score (<LINK REF="REF-Ishak-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ishak 1995</LINK>);<BR/>- number and type of adverse events. Two types of adverse events were analysed, serious adverse events and adverse events not considered serious. The serious adverse events were any untoward medical occurrence that resulted in death, was life-threatening, required hospitalisation or prolongation of hospitalisation, resulted in persistent or significant disability, was a congenital anomaly/birth defect or was an event that may jeopardise the patient or required intervention to prevent one of the former serious adverse events (<LINK REF="REF-ICH_x002d_GCP-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">ICH-GCP 1997</LINK>). All other adverse events were considered non-serious;<BR/>- quality-of-life;<BR/>- health economics.</P>

<P>Electronic searches<BR/>
<I>The trials registers of The Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group</I>, <I>The Cochrane Complementary Medicine Field</I>, and The <I>CENTRAL database</I> of <I>The Cochrane Library</I> as well as <I>MEDLINE</I> (March 1966 to February 2001), <I>EMBASE</I> (January 1980 to February 2001), <I>BIOSIS</I> (January 1969 to February 2001) and <I>Chinese Biomedical CD Database</I> (January 1979 to February 2001) were searched from their date of inception onwards. The search terms included hepatitis-C, medicine-traditional, herbal-medicine, medicine-Chinese, plants-medicinal, drugs-herbal, plants extracts, herbs, herbs-medicinal, medicinal-herbs, drugs-non-prescription, alternative-medicine, complementary-medicine, traditional-medicine, and medicine-traditional-oriental.</P>
<P>Handsearches<BR/>The journals <I>Chinese Journal of Infectious Diseases</I>, <I>Chinese Journal of Hepatology</I>, <I>Chinese Journal of Clinical Hepatology</I>, <I>Chinese Journal of Integrated Traditional and Western Medicine</I>, <I>Chinese Journal of Integrated Traditional and Western Medicine on Liver Diseases</I> were searched by JL and <I>Japanese Journal of Oriental Medicine</I> was searched by KT from the first publication date onwards to 2001. Conference proceedings in Chinese were also handsearched. The results of the handsearches were submitted to the Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group. The reference lists of identified randomised clinical trials and review articles were checked in order to find randomised trials not identified by the electronic searches or handsearches.</P>

<DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2008-10-13 14:26:32 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Selection of trials for inclusion<BR/>Two authors independently selected the trials to be included in the review according to the prespecified selection criteria. Any disagreement was resolved by discussion.</P>
<P>Assessment of methodological quality<BR/>Concealment of the allocation was scored A (adequate), B (unclear), or C (inadequate), following criteria adopted from The Cochrane Handbook and Schulz et al. (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>) as follows:<BR/>A - Adequate measures to conceal allocations such as central randomisation; serially numbered, opaque, sealed envelopes; or other description that contained convincing elements of concealment.<BR/>B - Unclearly concealed trials, in which the authors either did not report an allocation concealment approach at all, or reported an approach that did not fall into one of the categories in (A).<BR/>C - Inadequately concealed trials, in which method of allocation was not concealed, such as alternation methods or use of case record numbers. Such trials were excluded.</P>
<P>The double blinding method was described and assessed as adequate or inadequate.</P>
<P>Further, we registered whether the randomised clinical trials reported to have used intention-to-treat analysis or not (<LINK REF="REF-Gluud-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gluud 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>In addition, the randomised clinical trials were assessed by the Jadad scale (<LINK REF="REF-Jadad-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jadad 1996</LINK>). The scale awards one to five points. Trials with one or two points were considered low methodological quality and trials with three to five points were considered high methodological quality (<LINK REF="REF-Moher-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kjaergard-2001b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kjaergard 2001b</LINK>).</P>
<P>Data extraction<BR/>Data were extracted independently by two authors using a self-developed data extraction form. Papers not in Chinese, Danish, English, Japanese, German, and French were translated with the help of the Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group. The following characteristics and data were extracted from each included trial: primary author, quality assessment, mean age, gender, and ethnic of patients, number of randomised patients and number lost during follow-up, patient inclusion and exclusion criteria, dosage and duration of intervention, outcome measures, and number and type of adverse events.</P>
<P>Data on the number of patients with each outcome, by allocated treatment group, irrespective of compliance or follow-up, were sought to allow an intention-to-treat analysis. If the above data were not available in the trial reports, further information was sought by correspondence with the principal investigator.</P>
<P>Data synthesis<BR/>Dichotomous data were presented as relative risk (RR) and continuous outcomes as weighted mean difference (WMD), both with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Analyses were performed by intention-to-treat where possible. For dichotomous outcomes, patients with incomplete or missing data were included in a sensitivity analysis by counting them as treatment failures to explore the possible effect of loss to follow-up on the findings ('worst-case' scenario). Meta-analysis was performed within comparisons where individual trials compared the same medicinal herb versus the same control intervention.</P>
<P>We intended to display trials as comparisons of medicinal herbs versus:<BR/>- no intervention or placebo;<BR/>- non-specific intervention;<BR/>- other medicinal herbs;<BR/>- IFN monotherapy;<BR/>- ribavirin monotherapy;<BR/>- IFN/ribavirin combination therapy.</P>
<P>Trials of medicinal herbs plus IFN/ribavirin versus IFN/ribavirin alone were presented as a separate comparison.</P>
<P>If a sufficient number of randomised clinical trials were identified, we planned to perform subgroup analyses according to their methodological quality:<BR/>- trials with adequate versus inadequate concealment of allocation;<BR/>- trials with adequate versus inadequate double-blinding;<BR/>- trials with versus without use of intention-to-treat analysis;<BR/>- trials with high versus low Jadad scores (&gt; or = three versus &lt; or = two points).</P>
<P>Furthermore, if a sufficient number of randomised clinical trials were identified, we planned to perform the following subgroup analyses:<BR/>- ethnic origin;<BR/>- acute or chronic HCV infection;<BR/>- chronic hepatitis C with or without cirrhosis;<BR/>- treatment response. The desired treatment response indicator is viral clearance, as indicated by non-detectability of HCV RNA in serum by the most sensitive test available. An end-of-treatment viral response is defined as non-detectability of HCV RNA at the end of treatment. A sustained viral response is defined as non-detectability of HCV RNA at six months after completion of treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Farrell-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Farrell 2000</LINK>);<BR/>- excluding those trials in which chronic hepatitis C was not histologically confirmed.</P>
<P>Potential biases (<LINK REF="REF-Vickers-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vickers 1998</LINK>) were investigated according to Egger et al. (<LINK REF="REF-Egger-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Egger 1997</LINK>).</P>

<P>Our initial searches identified 104 references, 89 from the electronic searches and 15 from the handsearches. After reading titles and abstracts, 59 of these articles were excluded because they were duplicates, non-clinical studies, or had study objectives different from this review. A total of 45 references published in three languages (Chinese, English, and Japanese) were retrieved for further assessment. Of these, 35 references were excluded because they did not meet our inclusion criteria. The reasons for exclusion were listed under 'Characteristics of excluded studies'.</P>
<P>The remaining ten randomised clinical trials reported random allocation of patients (n = 517) with mainly (&gt; 75%) chronic hepatitis C to medicinal herbs versus control (placebo in four trials, IFN treatment in four trials, herb plus non-specific treatment in one trial, and herb plus ribavirin in one trial). One of these trials included an extra intervention arm, so that the medicinal herb could be compared with IFN and with the combination of IFN and the medicinal herb (<LINK REF="STD-Xiao-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Xiao 1999</LINK>). These ten randomised clinical trials met all our pre-specified inclusion criteria listed under 'Characteristics of included studies', of which four trials were published in English and six in Chinese. One of the trials (<LINK REF="STD-Raymond-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Raymond 1998</LINK>), however, evaluated Complete Thymic Formula versus placebo. Complete Thymic Formula contains various herbs, but in addition vitamins, enzymes, minerals as well as bovine glandular extracts of thymosin, thymopoietin, and thymic humoral factor (<LINK REF="STD-Raymond-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Raymond 1998</LINK>). It is therefore not a pure herb and it may be argued that this trial should be excluded.</P>
<P>Patients<BR/>A total of 517 patients were randomised in the ten trials. Two trials included inpatients, three trials included outpatients, and one trial included both out- and inpatients. The remaining four trials did not specify the origin of the patients. All ten randomised clinical trials included adults. The mean age was 32 years in nine trials providing data. One trial did not describe the sex or age of 25 participants from the control arm (<LINK REF="STD-Chen-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Chen 1998</LINK>), and the rest reported a male to female ratio of 1.9:1 (322:170). The average size of the trials was 53 patients, ranging from 20 to 78 patients.</P>
<P>Diagnosis<BR/>The inclusion criteria were explicit HCV infection diagnosed by clinical manifestations, biochemical responses, and virological markers. Three trials confirmed the diagnosis by liver biopsy (<LINK REF="STD-Batey-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Batey 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Buzzelli-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Buzzelli 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-van-Rossum-1999" TYPE="STUDY">van Rossum 1999</LINK>). Seven trials included only patients with chronic hepatitis C, one trial included patients with acute and chronic hepatitis C (<LINK REF="STD-Chen-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Chen 1998</LINK>), and another two trials included patients with hepatitis C, but did not report the clinical type of hepatitis C (<LINK REF="STD-Yu-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Yu 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jiang-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Jiang 1999</LINK>). At least 75% of the 517 patients had chronic hepatitis C.</P>
<P>Interventions<BR/>Ten different herbs were tested in ten randomised trials. No medicinal herb was tested twice among the ten included trials. According to the category of medicinal herbs, two trials studied a single herb or ingredient of a single herb (silymarin preparation and glycyrrhizin), seven trials studied compounds of herbs (CH-100, Bing Gan Ling, Bing Gan capsule, Bing Gan Tang, Gan Su capsule, Yi Er Gan Tang, and Yi Zhu decoction) and one trial studied various herbs combined with other alternative medicines (Complete Thymic Formula). The constituents and dosage of medicinal herbs varied (see Additional table 01: Preparations and compositions of the medicinal herbs) (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>). The median duration of treatment was 14 weeks (range one to 24 weeks). The control interventions included placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Batey-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Batey 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Buzzelli-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Buzzelli 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Raymond-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Raymond 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-van-Rossum-1999" TYPE="STUDY">van Rossum 1999</LINK>), IFNs (<LINK REF="STD-Chen-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Chen 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Han-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Han 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pei-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Pei 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Xiao-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Xiao 1999</LINK>), other herb plus non-specific treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Yu-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Yu 1995</LINK>), and glycyrrhizin plus ribavirin (<LINK REF="STD-Jiang-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Jiang 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>Outcomes<BR/>None of the ten trials reported mortality, incidence of liver cirrhosis and/or hepatocellular carcinoma, liver histology, quality-of-life, or health economics. The common outcomes reported were viral responses (including serum HCV RNA and anti-HCV antibody), biochemical responses, symptoms and signs, as well as adverse effects. Six trials reported follow-up after the end of intervention with medicinal herbs. Duration of follow-up after the end of interventions was six to 12 months.</P>

<STUDY_QUALITY>
<P>Of the ten included randomised clinical trials, two used adequate allocation concealment (<LINK REF="STD-Batey-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Batey 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-van-Rossum-1999" TYPE="STUDY">van Rossum 1999</LINK>), four had high methodological quality (a Jadad-score of five points for <LINK REF="STD-van-Rossum-1999" TYPE="STUDY">van Rossum 1999</LINK>; four points for <LINK REF="STD-Batey-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Batey 1998</LINK>; and three points for <LINK REF="STD-Buzzelli-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Buzzelli 1993</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Raymond-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Raymond 1998</LINK>), and the remaining trials had unclear allocation concealment and low methodological quality (a Jadad-score of one point for <LINK REF="STD-Chen-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Chen 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Han-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Han 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jiang-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Jiang 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pei-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Pei 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Xiao-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Xiao 1999</LINK>, and <LINK REF="STD-Yu-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Yu 1995</LINK>). Four of the ten trials reported using the double-blind design, which was assessed as adequate (<LINK REF="STD-Batey-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Batey 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Buzzelli-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Buzzelli 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Raymond-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Raymond 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-van-Rossum-1999" TYPE="STUDY">van Rossum 1999</LINK>). <BR/>
<BR/>None of the trials reported a sample size calculation or stated that intention-to-treat analysis was used.

<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
<P>Mortality<BR/>No trial reported the outcome mortality.</P>
<P>Liver fibrosis, cirrhosis, and/or liver cancer<BR/>No trial reported the outcomes of liver fibrosis, liver cirrhosis, and/or liver cancer.</P>
<P>Viral and biochemical responses</P>
<P>- CH-100 versus placebo<BR/>The herbal medicine CH-100 showed no significant effect on clearance of serum HCV RNA compared with placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Batey-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Batey 1998</LINK>). None of the 22 patients with positive HCV RNA in both arms of the trial lost serum HCV RNA or normalised serum ALT activity at the end of six months of treatment. There was no significant difference on serum ALT activity between the herb and the placebo arm after the intervention.</P>
<P>- Glycyrrhizin versus placebo<BR/>Glycyrrhizin did not show any effect on clearance of serum HCV compared with placebo (<LINK REF="STD-van-Rossum-1999" TYPE="STUDY">van Rossum 1999</LINK>). No patient in the two arms cleared serum HCV within four weeks treatment. Glycyrrhizin had no significant effect on serum ALT activity.</P>
<P>- Complete Thymic Formula versus placebo<BR/>Complete Thymic Formula showed no significant effects on the clearance of serum HCV RNA or on the level of HCV RNA compared with placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Raymond-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Raymond 1998</LINK>). None of the 32 patients from both arms lost serum HCV RNA within three to six months of treatment. There were no significant differences in mean HCV RNA titers or serum ALT activity between the herbal medicine and placebo. Complete Thymic Formula showed no significant effect on serum AST activity compared with placebo.</P>
<P>- Silybin versus placebo<BR/>Silybin showed a significantly better effect compared with placebo on serum AST activity (WMD -24.60 units (U)/l, 95% CI -34.28 to -14.92 U/l, P &lt; 0.00001) and serum gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase activity (WMD -18.40 U/l, 95% CI -23.78 to -13.02 U/l, P &lt; 0.0001), but was without significant effects on serum ALT activities and total bilirubin levels (<LINK REF="STD-Buzzelli-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Buzzelli 1993</LINK>). It is noteworthy that these effects were reported after only treating the patients for seven days.</P>
<P>- Bing Gan Ling versus IFN-alpha<BR/>Bing Gan Ling versus IFN-alpha showed no significant difference on the clearance of serum HCV RNA at the end of three months treatment (RR 1.31, 95% CI 0.65 to 2.65, P = 0.5) (<LINK REF="STD-Chen-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Chen 1998</LINK>) . Serum HCV RNA became negative in 13/31 (42%) patients treated with Bing Gan Ling and in 8/25 (32%) patients treated with IFN-alpha. Bing Gan Ling did not differ significantly from IFN-alpha regarding normalisation of serum ALT activity. </P>
<P>- Bing Gan capsules plus IFN versus IFN <BR/>Bing Gan capsules plus IFN (no indication of IFN type) showed a trend towards a better effect of the combination than IFN monotherapy, both on clearance of serum HCV RNA (RR 1.73, 95% CI 0.89 to 3.38, P = 0.11) and anti-HCV antibody positivity (RR 1.73, 95% CI 0.89 to 3.38, P = 0.11) (<LINK REF="STD-Han-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Han 1997</LINK>). Bing Gan capsule plus IFN also showed a trend towards a better effect on ALT normalisation than IFN monotherapy (RR 1.73, 95% CI 0.89 to 3.38, P = 0.11). </P>
<P>- Bing Gan Tang plus IFN-alpha versus IFN-alpha <BR/>Bing Gan Tang plus IFN-alpha showed a significant effect on the clearance of serum HCV RNA compared with IFN-alpha monotherapy (RR 2.54, 95% CI 1.43 to 4.49, P = 0.001) (<LINK REF="STD-Pei-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Pei 1996</LINK>). For the outcomes of clearance of serum anti-HCV antibody and normalisation of ALT activities, the combination therapy also showed a significant effect compared with IFN-alpha monotherapy (RR 2.54, 95% CI 1.43 to 4.49, P = 0.001). </P>
<P>- Gan Su capsules alone or plus IFN-alpha versus IFN-alpha<BR/>Compared to IFN-alpha, Gan Su capsule showed no significant effect on the normalisation either of serum HCV RNA or on ALT activity. Gan Su capsule plus IFN-alpha versus IFN-alpha showed no significant difference on the clearance of serum HCV RNA at the end of four months treatment (RR 1.58, 95% CI 0.52 to 4.77, P = 0.4) (<LINK REF="STD-Xiao-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Xiao 1999</LINK>) . The serum HCV RNA became negative in 6/20 (30%) patients in the combination group and in 4/21 (19%) patients of the IFN-alpha group. The combination of Gan Su capsule and IFN-alpha showed a trend toward better effect on ALT normalisation compared with IFN-alpha (RR 1.65, 95% CI 0.80 to 3.40, P = 0.17). </P>
<P>- Yi Zhu decoction versus glycyrrhizin plus ribavirin<BR/>Compared with glycyrrhizin plus ribavirin, Yi Zhu decoction showed a significant effect on the clearance of serum HCV RNA at the end of three months treatment (RR 1.64, 95% CI 1.07 to 2.50, P = 0.02) (<LINK REF="STD-Jiang-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Jiang 1999</LINK>). The same effect was observed on the normalisation of serum ALT levels (RR 1.64, 95% CI 1.07 to 2.50, P = 0.02). We caution about the interpretation of these results because the herbal treatment varied among the patients depending on the interpretation of the 'symptoms' by the Chinese investigator.</P>
<P>- Yi Er Gan Tang versus silymarin plus glucolactone<BR/>The herbal compound Yi Er Gan Tang was significantly better than silymarin plus glucurolactone on normalisation of ALT activity (RR 2.09, 95% CI 1.37 to 3.18, P = 0.0006) and in shortening the time to serum ALT normalisation (WMD - 20.20 days, 95% CI -22.66 to -17.74 days, P &lt; 0.00001) (<LINK REF="STD-Yu-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Yu 1995</LINK>). Viral markers were not analysed. </P>
<P>'Worst-case scenario' analyses<BR/>Based on the number of withdrawals and drop-outs reported in three trials (<LINK REF="STD-Batey-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Batey 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Raymond-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Raymond 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-van-Rossum-1999" TYPE="STUDY">van Rossum 1999</LINK>), 'worst-case scenario' analyses for the outcome of clearance of HCV RNA including all patients lost as treatment failures were performed. The size and direction of treatment effect were the same as reported above (data not shown). </P>
<P>Duration of follow-up<BR/>Six randomised clinical trials reported follow-up of one to 12 months after the end of treatment. However, the analysis of end of treatment response and sustained response could not be performed due to inadequate reporting in these trials. The trials reported the data from the end of treatment, and only stated that the efficacy was unchanged during follow-up. </P>
<P>Symptoms and signs <BR/>Five Chinese trials reported improvement of symptoms in patients with hepatitis C after the herbal treatment. However, we were unable to obtain data about individual symptoms and the numbers of patients with improvement of the symptoms after the interventions. </P>
<P>Adverse events<BR/>Adverse events were monitored and reported in six trials (<LINK REF="STD-Batey-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Batey 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Buzzelli-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Buzzelli 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chen-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Chen 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Han-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Han 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Raymond-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Raymond 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-van-Rossum-1999" TYPE="STUDY">van Rossum 1999</LINK>). </P>
<P>Four patients experienced adverse events during herbal therapy with CH-100, in which one patient developed palpitations, two diarrhoea, and one abdominal discomfort (<LINK REF="STD-Batey-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Batey 1998</LINK>). </P>
<P>In another trial, 13/25 patients receiving IFN-alpha injection developed fever, some developed chill, fatigue, myalgia, poor appetite, nausea, and a few patients lost their hair or experienced a decrease of white blood cells and platelet count (<LINK REF="STD-Chen-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Chen 1998</LINK>). There was no significant adverse effect found in 31 patients who took the herbal compound Bing Gan Ling (<LINK REF="STD-Chen-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Chen 1998</LINK>). </P>
<P>During IFN treatment (3 MU, thrice a week), 15/26 patients in the control group developed fever, headache, and myalgia; 9/26 patients developed loss of hair while in the herb group none of these adverse effects happened (<LINK REF="STD-Han-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Han 1997</LINK>). </P>
<P>Headache, increased fatigue, pain in the region of the liver, and dizziness were mentioned by patients of the placebo and glycyrrhizin intervention (<LINK REF="STD-van-Rossum-1999" TYPE="STUDY">van Rossum 1999</LINK>). However, no significant differences between the groups were observed. In this trial, cold or 'flu-like' symptoms, diarrhoea, rash or itching, and nausea were only observed in patients treated with the glycyrrhizin intervention. </P>
<P>One patient developed a serious adverse event, severe thrombocytopenia, during the fifth month of therapy with Complete Thymic Formula (<LINK REF="STD-Raymond-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Raymond 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>Funnel plot analysis<BR/>The outcome measure normalisation of serum ALT levels in seven included trials was used for a funnel plot analysis. A linear regression analysis, in which the standard normal deviate, defined as the RR divided by its standard error, was regressed against the estimate's precision, defined as the inverse of the standard error, showed no significant funnel plot asymmetry (intercept 0.41, standard error 0.67; t = 0.60; P = 0.57).</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2008-10-13 15:40:31 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Twelve different herbal medicines have been evaluated in ten randomised clinical trials including patients with HCV infection, mainly chronic hepatitis C. The present systematic review could not demonstrate any significant efficacy of any of the medicinal herbs (CH-100, glycyrrhizin, silybin, Complete Thymic Formula) when tested against placebo on HCV markers. However, Bing Gan Tang combined with IFN-alpha had positive effects on the clearance of HCV RNA and on normalisation of serum ALT levels compared with IFN-alpha monotherapy. However, at present there is no strong evidence for an efficacy of any of these medicinal herbs for HCV infection due to the fact that most positive effects were observed in single, small trials with low methodological quality. Due to the limited number of trials identified, we were prohibited to perform any of the planned sensitivity analyses and the lack of significant funnel plot asymmetry should be interpreted conservatively.</P>
<P>Strength of evidence<BR/>Six of the ten randomised clinical trials included in this review had low methodological quality. They provided only limited descriptions of study design, randomisation, and allocation concealment. Most trials stated only that random assignment was used, but did not give sufficient information to allow a judgement of whether or not it was conducted properly. Methodologically less rigorous trials show larger treatment effects than those conducted with better rigor (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moher-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kjaergard-2001b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kjaergard 2001b</LINK>). The insufficient number of trials prohibited us from performing meaningful sensitivity analysis to illuminate how robust the results of the review are to the exclusion of the trials with inadequate methodology. No large randomised clinical trials were identified.</P>
<P>Populations<BR/>Six trials were tested in Chinese patients and one each in Australians, Italians, Americans, and Europeans. They examined different herbal medicines. Therefore, it is not possible to infer anything on the applicability of these herbs in different populations.</P>
<P>Medicinal herbs<BR/>The included trials tested different herbs against different control interventions (placebo, IFN, or combination of herbal medicines). The preparations of the herbal medicines were given in different formulations (tablet, capsule, injection, or decoction). Ideally, we should evaluate well defined herbal constituents, dosage, duration, and control intervention in two or more independently conducted randomised trials when evaluating the efficacy of medicinal herbs. We were limited in this respect by the small number of identified trials.</P>
<P>When dealing with the efficacy and adverse events of medical herbs, one should apply just as rigorous criteria in the evaluation of these interventions as internationally required for pharmaceutical products (<LINK REF="REF-ICH_x002d_GCP-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">ICH-GCP 1997</LINK>). Many factors may affect the effect of herbs, including the species, the geographical origin, harvest season, preparation, storage, and extraction methods as well as dosage and duration of therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Blumberg-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blumberg 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schuppan-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schuppan 1999</LINK>). In clinical trials evaluating herbs it is, therefore, important to mention the specific botanical identification of the plant material, its geographical source, and the condition under which the plant substances were obtained. When the plant preparation is described in a monograph of a national or international Pharmacopoeia, all the quality control requirements should be fulfilled (<LINK REF="REF-EEC-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">EEC 1977</LINK>). If a monograph concerning the plant preparations does not exist, the manufacturer should write a protocol dealing with the above quality control requirements (<LINK REF="REF-Geerts-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Geerts 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>Potential efficacy<BR/>Four trials with high methodological quality did not show any significant efficacy on viral response and/or on liver biochemistry, except one small, short-term trial in which silybin (a milk thistle preparation) appears to have liver protecting effect based on improvement of two out of four biochemical measures (<LINK REF="STD-Buzzelli-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Buzzelli 1993</LINK>). One should be aware of the fact that this beneficial effect of silybin came from a trial with only 20 patients treated for one week and the trial did not examine if the efficacy was sustained. Further, another herb, Yi Er Gan Tang, seemed to be better than silymarin (another milk thistle preparation) plus glucurolactone in normalising serum ALT levels. Yi Zhu decoction seemed to be better than glycyrrhizin plus ribavirin in clearing HCV RNA and normalising ALT levels.</P>
<P>One herbal medicine Bing Gan Tang plus IFN may have positive effects on the clearance of HCV RNA and on normalisation of serum ALT levels compared to IFN monotherapy. The potential benefit of the herb Bing Gan Tang combined with IFN for treatment of chronic hepatitis C could encourage further trials. The currently recommended treatment for chronic hepatitis C is the combination therapy of IFN and ribavirin (<LINK REF="REF-Brok-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brok 2005</LINK>). Therefore, to explore possible combinations of IFN and ribavirin therapy with some potential herbal therapy may be an attractive option. Further, potential medicinal herbs can be tested against placebo in chronic hepatitis C patients who do not respond to the IFN and ribavirin treatment or who have contraindications to the standard treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Brok-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brok 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>The goal of treatment of chronic hepatitis C is to prevent progression to hepatic fibrosis, cirrhosis, and primary liver cancer. Available outcomes from the included trials were mainly laboratory tests, i.e., surrogate outcomes. There is lack of data from randomised clinical trials on clinically relevant outcomes from long-term follow-up such as the incidence of liver fibrosis, cirrhosis, cancer, and mortality and, therefore, we are not able to draw conclusions about these important outcomes. The same problem, however, also applies to what is considered standard therapy of chronic hepatitis C today (<LINK REF="REF-Brok-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brok 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>Adverse events<BR/>Due to the limited number of trials identified and the limited number of patients included in each of the trials it is not possible to evaluate the full extent of the risk of adverse events connected with intervention with the examined herbs. However, some of the herbs gave rise to adverse events and one of the medications, Complete Thymic Formula, gave rise to a serious adverse event. There have been recent reports of liver toxicity and cancer associated with herbal medicines (<LINK REF="REF-Melchart-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Melchart 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gottieb-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gottieb 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tomlinson-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tomlinson 2000</LINK>). Further, Fleig et al. (<LINK REF="REF-Fleig-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fleig 1997</LINK>) observed significantly higher mortality among patients with alcoholic cirrhosis treated with LIV.52 (an extract of several plants (<LINK REF="REF-Schuppan-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schuppan 1999</LINK>)) compared with placebo treated patients. These observations were done in spite of studies in rats and uncontrolled observations in patients pointing to a beneficial effect of LIV.52 on liver biochemistry (<LINK REF="REF-Schuppan-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schuppan 1999</LINK>). Monitoring safety of medicinal herbs in hepatitis C is important through adequate recording and reporting of adverse events in clinical trials. Rare and severe adverse events should be identified from large scale epidemiological studies.</P>
<P>Medicinal herbs and hepatitis C infection in the future<BR/>It is likely that certain medicinal herbs contain substances that may interact with viral load and/or prevent further liver injury. It is a difficult question, however, to point to which trials we need to conduct in the future. The field of medicinal herbs is more difficult than the traditional development of pharmaceutical interventions. First, we are dealing with a vast plethora of substances that have been brought to us from ancient times. Second, even focusing on one single medicinal herb raises the problems of its components and how they work in consort. Third, in spite of the fact that we may not have plausible biological reason for using some of the herbs, the use of these herbs are widespread in the East as well as in the West (<LINK REF="REF-Schuppan-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schuppan 1999</LINK>). In order to find medicinal herbs that works and to prevent patients from taking herbs, which do not have any efficacy and which may cause significant detrimental effects (see above), we may have to conduct randomised trials which can reveal the true benefits and harms these herbs may cause. In deciding which herbs to test in the future, we should use the combination of biological experiences as well as the results from randomised clinical trials.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>There is currently insufficient evidence for treating HCV infections with any of the examined medicinal herbs due to the small number of randomised trials conducted, the paucity of patients having entered these trials, and the low methodological quality of the trials.<BR/>
</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>It is necessary to have a much better description of the medicinal herbs being tested, including among others information on plant species, geographical origin, harvest season, preparation procedures, and quality control measures. </P>
<P>The methodological quality of clinical trials on medicinal herbs needs to be improved. The following aspects concerning methodological quality are important: (i) reporting of the generation of the allocation sequence and of allocation concealment, (ii) application of double blinding, (iii) clear description of withdrawals/dropouts during the trial, (iv) reporting of clinically important outcome measures from long-term follow-up. </P>
<P>In patients with HCV infection, it is necessary to have information on clinical and/or histological stage of the liver disease, the presence or absence of cirrhosis, the genotype of HCV, and other well proven prognostic indicators also when assessing the efficacy of medicinal herbs.</P>
<P>Rigorously designed, randomised, multicentre clinical trials are required to evaluate medicinal herbs with potential efficacy for hepatitis C. Besides the standard evaluation of virological and biochemical responses (which should be assessed at the end of treatment and at least at six months of follow-up after the end of treatment), outcome measures should include liver-related outcomes like incidence of hepatic fibrosis, cirrhosis, and liver cancer as well as quality-of-life and health economics. Standardised monitoring or an effective self-report system should critically estimate adverse events.</P>
