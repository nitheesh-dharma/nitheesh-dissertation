<P>
<B>Background</B>
<BR/>Ventilators are machines that breathe for patients. The ventilator tube goes into the mouth and through the windpipe. Sometimes there are bacteria on the ventilator tube that infect the patient's lungs, leading to a disease called ventilator-associated pneumonia. Ventilator-associated pneumonia can cause significant harmful effects, and can sometimes lead to death. When treating people with ventilator-associated pneumonia, doctors must decide which antibiotic therapy to prescribe, usually without knowing the particular type of bacterial infection. This decision is important because inappropriate initial treatment may increase risk of harmful effects and longer hospital stays.</P>
<P>
<B>Search date</B>
<BR/>We searched for studies to December 2015.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
<BR/>We looked at studies involving adults aged over 18 years who were treated in intensive care units for ventilator-associated pneumonia and needed antibiotic treatment. We analysed 12 studies with 3571 participants.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
<BR/>All included studies looked at the use of one antibiotic treatment plan versus another, but these varied among studies. There was potential for bias because some studies did not report outcomes for all participants, and funding for many was provided by pharmaceutical companies and study authors were affiliated with these companies.</P>
<P>We used statistical techniques to evaluate our results. For single versus multiple antibiotics, we found no difference in rates of death or cure, or adverse events. For our comparison of combination therapies with optional adjunctives we were only able to analyse clinical cure for one the antibiotics Tigecycline and imipenem-cilastatin for which imipenem-cilastatin was found to have higher clinica cure. We also looked at carbapenem (antibiotics used to treat infections caused by multidrug-resistant bacteria) versus non-carbapenem treatment; we found no difference in death rate or adverse effects, but we found that carbapenems are associated with an increase in clinical cure.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of evidence</B>
We assessed evidence quality as moderate for most outcomes, and very low for clinical cure when single-antibiotic treatment was compared with multiple antibiotic therapy. We also found that evidence quality was low for adverse events when carbapenem was compared with non-carbapenem treatment.</P>
<P>
<B>Conclusions</B>
<BR/>We did not find differences between single and combination therapy, lending support to use of a single-antibiotic treatment plan for people with ventilator-associated pneumonia. This may not be applicable to all patients because studies did not identify patients who are at risk of exposure to harmful types of bacteria.</P>
<P>We could not evaluate the best single-antibiotic choice to treat people with ventilator-associated pneumonia because there were too few studies, but carbapenems may achieve better cure rates than other tested antibiotics.</P>

<ABSTRACT MODIFIED="2016-10-18 11:41:26 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Liz Dooley">
<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2016-10-07 14:14:23 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Dooley">
<P>Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality, complicating the medical course of approximately 10% of mechanically-ventilated patients, with an estimated attributable mortality of 13%. To treat VAP empirically, the American Thoracic Society currently recommends antibiotic therapy based on the patients' risk of colonisation by an organism with multidrug resistance. The selection of initial antibiotic therapy in VAP is important, as inappropriate initial antimicrobial treatment is associated with higher mortality and longer hospital stay in intensive care unit (ICU) patients.</P>
<P>While guidelines exist for the antibiotic treatment of hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) from the American Thoracic Society and the British Society for Antimicrobial Chemotherapy, there are many limitations in the quality of available evidence. This systematic review aimed to summarise the results of all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compare empirical antibiotic regimens for VAP.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2016-10-06 16:57:52 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Dooley">
<P>The primary objective of this review was to assess the effect of different empirical antimicrobial therapies on the survival and clinical cure of adult patients with ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Secondary objectives included reporting the incidence of adverse events, new superinfections, length of hospital stay, and length of intensive care unit (ICU) stay associated with these therapies.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2016-10-07 10:48:00 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Dooley">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, CINAHL and Web of Science to December 2015; we searched ClinicalTrials.gov to September 2016.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2016-10-07 11:15:02 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Dooley">
<P>Two review authors independently assessed RCTs comparing empirical antibiotic treatments of VAP in adult patients, where VAP was defined as new-onset pneumonia that developed more than 48 hours after endotracheal intubation. Physicians and researchers were not required to be blinded for inclusion in this review.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2016-10-07 11:14:58 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Dooley">
<P>Two review authors independently extracted study data. We pooled studies and analysed them in two ways. We examined monotherapy, or a single experimental antimicrobial drug, versus combination therapy, or multiple experimental antimicrobial drugs. We also examined carbapenem therapy versus non-carbapenem therapy.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-10-18 11:41:26 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Liz Dooley">
<P>We included 12 studies with 3571 participants. All included studies examined the empiric use of one antimicrobial regimen versus another for the treatment of adults with VAP, but the particular drug regimens examined by each study varied. There was potential for bias because some studies did not report outcomes for all participants. All but one study reported sources of funding or author affiliations with pharmaceutical companies.</P>
<P>We found no statistical difference in all-cause mortality between monotherapy and combination therapy (N = 4; odds ratio (OR) monotherapy versus combination 0.97, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.73 to 1.30), clinical cure (N = 2; OR monotherapy versus combination 0.88, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.36), length of stay in ICU (mean difference (MD) 0.65, 95% CI 0.07 to 1.23) or adverse events (N = 2; OR monotherapy versus combination 0.93, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.26). We downgraded the quality of evidence for all-cause mortality, adverse events, and length of ICU stay to moderate for this comparison. We determined clinical cure for this comparison to be of very low-quality evidence.</P>
<P>For our second comparison of combination therapy with optional adjunctives only one meta-analysis could be performed due to a lack of trials comparing the same antibiotic regimens. Two studies compared tigecycline versus imipenem-cilastatin for clinical cure in the clinically evaluable population and there was a statistically significant increase in clinical cure for imipenem-cilastatin (N = 2; OR tigecycline versus imipenem-cilastatin 0.44, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.84). Of importance, this effect was due to a single study.</P>
<P>We found no statistical difference in all-cause mortality between carbapenem and non-carbapenem therapies (N = 1; OR carbapenem versus non-carbapenem 0.59, 95% CI 0.30 to 1.19) or adverse events (N = 3; OR carbapenem versus non-carbapenem 0.78, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.09), but we found that carbapenems are associated with a statistically significant increase in the clinical cure (N = 3; OR carbapenem versus non-carbapenem 1.53, 95% CI 1.11 to 2.12 for intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis and N = 2; OR carbapenem versus non-carbapenem 2.29, 95% CI 1.19 to 4.43 for clinically evaluable patients analysis). For this comparison we downgraded the quality of evidence for mortality, and clinical cure (ITT and clinically evaluable populations) to moderate. We determined the quality of evidence for adverse events to be low.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2016-10-17 00:34:29 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We did not find a difference between monotherapy and combination therapy for the treatment of people with VAP. Since studies did not identify patients with increased risk for multidrug-resistant bacteria, these data may not be generalisable to all patient groups. However, this is the largest meta-analysis comparing monotherapy to multiple antibiotic therapies for VAP and contributes further evidence to the safety of using effective monotherapy for the empiric treatment of VAP.</P>
<P>Due to lack of studies, we could not evaluate the best antibiotic choice for VAP, but carbapenems as a class may result in better clinical cure than other tested antibiotics.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2016-10-18 11:46:09 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Liz Dooley">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2016-10-17 00:25:16 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Despite advances in antimicrobial therapy, improved supportive care modalities, and the use of preventive measures, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) remains an important cause of morbidity and mortality, complicating the course of approximately 10% of patients receiving mechanical ventilation, with an estimated attributable mortality rate of 13% (<LINK REF="REF-Meslen-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meslen 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-West-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">West 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>VAP is defined as pneumonia that develops more than 48 hours after endotracheal intubation. The definition of VAP has remained unchanged in the 2005 and 2016 Clinical Practice Guidelines developed by the Infectious Diseases Society of America and the American Thoracic Society (<LINK REF="REF-ATS-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">ATS 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-ATS-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">ATS 2016</LINK>). VAP diagnosis is usually based on three components: clinical signs of infection (fever, leukocytosis (increased white blood cell counts), or purulent tracheobronchial secretions); new or worsening infiltrates seen on the chest X-ray; and bacteriologic evidence of pulmonary parenchymal infection (<LINK REF="REF-Chastre-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chastre 2002</LINK>). Unfortunately, unlike community-acquired pneumonia, the clinical and radiological signs are non-specific in hospitalised ventilated patients. The systemic signs of infection (fever, tachycardia and leukocytosis) are non-specific findings and can be caused by any condition that releases cytokines. Furthermore, the plain chest X-ray is most helpful when it is normal and rules out pneumonia; when infiltrates are evident, the particular pattern is of limited value for differentiating among cardiogenic pulmonary oedema, non-cardiogenic pulmonary oedema, pulmonary contusion, atelectasis (or collapse), and pneumonia.</P>
<P>The aetiologic diagnosis generally requires a lower respiratory tract culture (although it is occasionally made from blood or pleural fluid cultures). Respiratory tract cultures can include endotracheal aspirates, broncheo-alveolar lavage, or protected specimen brush specimens (<LINK REF="REF-ATS-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">ATS 2005</LINK>). It is preferable to use non-invasive respiratory sampling with endotracheal aspirates and semiquantitative cultures (<LINK REF="REF-ATS-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">ATS 2016</LINK>). Although an aetiologic diagnosis can be made from an upper respiratory tract culture, colonisation of the trachea precedes development of pneumonia in almost all people with VAP, so a positive culture cannot always distinguish a pathogen from a colonising organism (<LINK REF="REF-ATS-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">ATS 2005</LINK>). Despite this, an attempt to establish a microbiological diagnosis is desirable in every patient with suspected VAP, because detection of causative organisms enables the initial empiric antibiotic regimen to be adjusted (<LINK REF="REF-Torres-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Torres 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>Time of pneumonia onset is an important epidemiologic variable and risk factor for specific pathogens and outcomes in patients with VAP (<LINK REF="REF-ATS-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">ATS 2016</LINK>). Early-onset VAP, occurring during the first four days (96 hours) of mechanical ventilation, is likely to be caused by pathogens which originate in the oropharyngeal cavity <I>Staphylococcus aureus</I> (<I>S aureus</I>),<I> Streptococcus pneumoniae </I>(<I>S pneumoniae</I>), and<I> Haemophilus influenzae </I>(<I>H influenzae</I>). Late-onset VAP, which develops five or more days after starting mechanical ventilation, is more likely to be caused by Gram-negative bacilli, <I>S aureus, </I>including methicillin-resistant, <I>Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P aeruginosa),</I> and <I>Acinetobacter spp</I> (<LINK REF="REF-ATS-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">ATS 2005</LINK>)<I>. </I>These organisms are more likely to be multi-resistant to antimicrobials and therefore difficult to treat. However, the most recent American Thoracic Society guidelines state that the key decision in initial empiric therapy is whether the patient has risk factors for multidrug-resistant organisms rather than time of onset of VAP. Risk factors for multidrug-resistant pathogens include the following (<LINK REF="REF-ATS-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">ATS 2016</LINK>).</P>

</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2016-10-18 11:46:09 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Liz Dooley">
<P>Empiric therapy is defined as the use of antibiotics before a bacteriologic diagnosis of infection is proven (<LINK REF="REF-Kim-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kim 1989</LINK>). This differs from directed therapy that is targeted at a specific known pathogen, and prophylactic therapy given to prevent the development of infection (<LINK REF="REF-Kim-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kim 1989</LINK>). According to the American Thoracic Society guidelines, empirical antibiotic selection for each patient should be based on the risk for multidrug-resistant pathogens (<LINK REF="REF-ATS-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">ATS 2016</LINK>).</P>
<P>Inappropriate initial antimicrobial treatment is associated with higher mortality and longer hospital stays in intensive care unit (ICU) patients (<LINK REF="REF-Rello-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rello 2007</LINK>). Delays in the administration of appropriate therapy are associated with increased hospital mortality from HAP, and furthermore, changing antimicrobial therapy once culture results are available may not reduce the increased risk of hospital mortality associated with inappropriate initial antibiotic therapy. Therefore, selection of initial appropriate therapy (that is, getting the antibiotic treatment right the first time) is an important aspect of care for hospitalised patients with serious infections (<LINK REF="REF-ATS-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">ATS 2016</LINK>).</P>
<P>The pathogens commonly associated with inappropriate initial empiric antimicrobial therapy include <I>P aeruginosa</I>, <I>Acinetobacter spp</I>, <I>Klebsiella pneumoniae (K pneumoniae)</I>, <I>Enterobacter </I>species, and MRSA (<LINK REF="REF-ATS-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">ATS 2005</LINK>). Patients at risk of infection with these pathogens should initially receive a combination of agents that can provide a broad-spectrum of coverage to minimise the potential for inappropriate antibiotic treatment (<LINK REF="REF-ATS-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">ATS 2005</LINK>). The choice of agents should be based on local patterns of antimicrobial susceptibility, and anticipated side effects, and should also take into account which therapies patients have recently received (within the past two weeks), striving not to repeat the same antimicrobial class, if possible. The initial antimicrobial therapy regimen needs to take into account local bacteriologic patterns, and each hospital and ICU should ideally have their own antibiogram (recording the antimicrobial susceptibility of the locally identified micro-organisms), which is updated as often as possible.</P>
<P>Finally, broad-spectrum, empiric antibiotic therapy should be accompanied by a commitment to de-escalate antibiotics, on the basis of serial clinical and microbiological data, to limit the emergence of resistance in the hospital (<LINK REF="REF-ATS-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">ATS 2016</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2016-09-15 11:55:09 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Ann Jones">
<P>Because appropriate antimicrobial treatment of patients with VAP significantly improves outcomes, more rapid identification of infection and accurate selection of antimicrobial agents are important clinical goals (<LINK REF="REF-Chastre-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chastre 2002</LINK>). Conversely, studies using multivariate analysis have clearly demonstrated that delayed and/or inappropriate initial antibiotic therapy is strongly associated with fatality in critically ill patients with infections, including VAP (<LINK REF="REF-Fagon-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fagon 2006</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2016-10-07 14:38:19 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Dooley">
<P>A previous Cochrane Review found that a combination of topical and systemic antibiotics reduces the occurrence of respiratory tract infections and overall mortality in patients in ICUs (<LINK REF="REF-Liberati-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liberati 2009</LINK>). A systematic review of the evidence for the treatment of HAP in ICU patients has not been published. Guidelines are available for the antibiotic treatment of HAP from the American Thoracic Society/Infectious Diseases Society of America (<LINK REF="REF-ATS-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">ATS 2016</LINK>), and the British Society for Antimicrobial Chemotherapy (<LINK REF="REF-Masterton-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Masterton 2008</LINK>). However, there are many limitations in the quality of the available evidence to assist in selecting the most appropriate antimicrobial regimen for people with VAP. Few studies have compared more than two therapeutic options and very few studies had sufficient power to demonstrate the superiority of one regimen over another (<LINK REF="REF-Masterton-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Masterton 2008</LINK>). We aimed to summarise the results of all RCTs that compare empirical antibiotic regimens for people with VAP.</P>

<P>Selection bias: we assessed random sequence generation and allocation concealment. If a study was reported as 'randomised', but the method of randomisation or concealment was not reported, then we assigned the study as 'unclear risk'.</P>
<P>Blinding of participants and personnel (performance bias): participants were on mechanical ventilation and hence under deep sedation and unaware of their assigned treatment group. Therefore only blinding of personnel was assessed for this criterion. If the study was reported as blinded but no details of personnel blinding were provided, we assigned the study as 'unclear risk'.</P>
<P>Blinding of outcome assessment (detection bias): we assigned studies with blinded evaluation committees that reviewed the clinical and microbiological data relevant to the outcome as 'low risk'. We assigned studies in which all outcomes are objective and the outcome assessor was blinded as 'low risk'. We assigned studies that did not report blinding of outcome assessment as 'unclear risk'. We assigned studies that assessed outcomes in an open way without independent and blinded review committees as 'high risk'.</P>
<P>Incomplete outcome data (attrition bias): if no participants were lost or the reasons for exclusion and number or participants lost are the same for both arms, we assigned the study as 'low risk'. If reasons for exclusions were not reported, we assigned the study as 'high risk'.</P>

We used the five GRADE considerations (study limitations, consistency of effect, imprecision, indirectness and publication bias) to assess the quality of a body of evidence as it relates to the studies which contribute data to the meta-analyses for the prespecified outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-Atkins-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Atkins 2004</LINK>). We used methods and recommendations described in Section 8.5 and Chapter 12 of the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions </I>(<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>), using GRADEpro GDT software (<LINK REF="REF-GRADEpro-GDT-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">GRADEpro GDT 2015</LINK>).

<P>We did not create a 'Summary of findings' table for results comparing combination therapy with optional adjunctives. In this comparison both arms received a combination therapy with mostly different antibiotics. The adjunctives in each of the studies are specifically aimed at other pathogens that can be dependent on local prevalences and resistance patterns. The comparison would then encompass combination therapy versus combination therapy which would not make much clinical sense.<BR/>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Monotherapy versus combination therapy</HEADING>
<P>We found four studies that compared monotherapy to combination therapy (<LINK REF="STD-Alvarez-Lerma-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Alvarez Lerma 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Awad-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Awad 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Damas-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Damas 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Heyland-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Heyland 2008</LINK>). Three studies had true monotherapy arms (<LINK REF="STD-Alvarez-Lerma-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Alvarez Lerma 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Damas-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Damas 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Heyland-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Heyland 2008</LINK>), and <LINK REF="STD-Awad-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Awad 2014</LINK> had the option of adding adjunctive fluoroquinolones or aminoglycosides. Our analysis demonstrated no significant difference in our primary end point of all-cause mortality between monotherapy and combination therapy. The studies we reviewed did not distinguish between early- or late-onset ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).</P>
<P>We also evaluated differences in clinical cure on an intention-to-treat (ITT) basis and for clinically evaluable patients based on data from two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Alvarez-Lerma-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Alvarez Lerma 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Awad-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Awad 2014</LINK>). The results of the meta-analysis revealed no significant difference between monotherapy versus combination therapy with regard to clinical cure.</P>
<P>Two studies reported adverse events (<LINK REF="STD-Alvarez-Lerma-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Alvarez Lerma 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Awad-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Awad 2014</LINK>). Our analysis did not reveal any significant differences in adverse events between monotherapy and combination therapy. The rate of superinfections was reported in only one study and we were therefore unable to pool data (<LINK REF="STD-Alvarez-Lerma-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Alvarez Lerma 2001</LINK>). Of note, is that no increase in superinfections was found in the monotherapy group in the only study reporting this outcome.</P>
<P>Our meta-analysis data did not show a difference between monotherapy and combination therapy for VAP. This would support the use of a single-antibiotic regimen, with the understanding that resistance patterns vary depending on the local environment. However, epidemiologic data that relies on culture positive data only does not discriminate between colonisation and true infections. This is especially true for VAP where tracheal aspirates may reflect upper respiratory colonisation rather than a true cause of VAP.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Combination therapy with optional adjunctives</HEADING>
<P>We identified eight studies that compared different antibiotics controlling for adjuncts (<LINK REF="STD-Beaucaire-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Beaucaire 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Brun_x002d_Buisson-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Brun-Buisson 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Freire-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Freire 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kollef-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Kollef 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kollef-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Kollef 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ramirez-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Ramirez 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rea_x002d_Neto-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Rea-Neto 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shorr-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Shorr 2005</LINK>). The included adjuncts were amikacin, vancomycin, linezolid, aztreonam, ceftazidime, and tobramycin. Unfortunately, only two studies evaluated the same antibiotics (tigecycline versus imipenem-cilastin) (<LINK REF="STD-Freire-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Freire 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ramirez-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Ramirez 2013</LINK>). These studies both reported clinical cure for the clinically evaluable population. Our meta-analysis demonstrated an improved clinical cure for imipenem-cilastatin (odds ratio (OR) tigecycline versus imipenem-cilastatin 0.44, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.23 to 0.84).</P>
<P>Five studies reported all-cause mortality (<LINK REF="STD-Beaucaire-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Beaucaire 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Brun_x002d_Buisson-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Brun-Buisson 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Freire-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Freire 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kollef-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Kollef 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kollef-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Kollef 2012</LINK>). No antibiotic combination was significantly better than another. With regard to clinical cure, three studies reported a significant improvement: in <LINK REF="STD-Brun_x002d_Buisson-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Brun-Buisson 1998</LINK> piperacillin-tazobactam demonstrated improved clinical cure over ceftazidime (OR piperacillin-tazobactam versus ceftazidime 1.84, 95% CI 1.04 to 3.28); <LINK REF="STD-Rea_x002d_Neto-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Rea-Neto 2008</LINK> favoured doripenem over piperacillin-tazobactam (OR piperacillin-tazobactam versus doripenem 0.47, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.96); <LINK REF="STD-Kollef-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Kollef 2004</LINK> favoured linezolid over vancomycin (OR linezolid versus vancomycin 1.46, 95% CI 1.02 to 2.08).</P>

Only <LINK REF="STD-Freire-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Freire 2010</LINK> reached statistical significance, revealing an increase in adverse events for tigecycline when compared to imipenem-cilastin (OR tigecycline vs imipenem-cilastatin 1.33, 95% CI 0.83 to 2.12).

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Carbapenems versus non-carbapenems</HEADING>
<P>Carbapenems are potent broad-spectrum antibiotics with coverage of extended spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs). We found four studies that compared carbapenems with other antibiotics (<LINK REF="STD-Freire-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Freire 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ramirez-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Ramirez 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rea_x002d_Neto-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Rea-Neto 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shorr-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Shorr 2005</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Freire-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Freire 2010</LINK> was the only study to report all-cause mortality, but there was no significant difference. Three studies reported clinical cure on an ITT basis (<LINK REF="STD-Freire-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Freire 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rea_x002d_Neto-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Rea-Neto 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shorr-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Shorr 2005</LINK>). Treatment with carbapenems had significantly higher clinical cure (OR carbapenem versus non-carbapenem 1.53, 95% CI 1.11 to 2.12) when compared to non-carbapenems including tigecycline, levofloxacin, and piperacillin-tazobactam. Three studies reported adverse events which did not reveal any significant difference (<LINK REF="STD-Freire-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Freire 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rea_x002d_Neto-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Rea-Neto 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shorr-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Shorr 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>Carbapenems are broader spectrum antibiotics than the comparative antibiotics in the three studies. Specifically, all carbapenems cover <I>Pseudomonas</I> species (except ertapenem) and ESBLs. Studies have been consistent in demonstrating worse outcomes with ineffective empiric antibiotics (<LINK REF="REF-Alvarez_x002d_Lerma-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alvarez-Lerma 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Garnacho_x002d_Montero-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Garnacho-Montero 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Iregui-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Iregui 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rello-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rello 2007</LINK>).

<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2016-10-17 01:01:44 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We used a comprehensive search strategy to identify all clinical trials evaluating antibiotic regimens for VAP. We also attempted to contact trial authors for other references. Our searches identified non-English language papers, indicating that we covered a wide range of references. However, it is possible that we missed some trials not published in mainstream journals, but it is unlikely that other small trials would change our conclusions. We will nevertheless monitor and continue searching for references to include in future review updates.</P>
<P>A major difficulty we encountered was the lack of studies examining the same antibiotics. This meant we were unable to perform meta-analysis for many comparisons. Since many included studies were small, meta-analysis would enable us to increase the power to levels sufficient to assess if there was superiority of one regimen.</P>
<P>We did not create a 'Summary of findings' table for results comparing combination therapy with optional adjunctives; in this comparison both arms received a combination therapy with mostly different antibiotics. The adjunctives in each of the studies are specifically aimed at other pathogens that can be dependent on local prevalences and resistance patterns. The comparison would then encompass combination therapy versus combination therapy which would not make much clinical sense.</P>
<P>We were unable to identify sufficient data for the outcomes of superinfections, length of hospital stay, and length of ICU stay.</P>
<P>Lastly, studies did not differentiate early- versus late-onset VAP and did not select patients at risk of multidrug-resistant bacteria. Since antibiotic resistance patterns are regionally defined, these data may not be generalisable.</P>

<P>We assessed quality of evidence using GRADE analysis.</P>
<P>For monotherapy versus combination therapy we assessed the quality of evidence for five comparisons: mortality rate, clinical cure in the ITT population, clinical cure in the clinically evaluable population, adverse events, and length of ICU stay. We downgraded the quality of evidence for all-cause mortality, adverse events, and length of ICU stay to moderate because of serious imprecision due to wide confidence intervals. For clinical cure in the ITT and clinically evaluable populations, we downgraded the quality of evidence from high to very low due to inconsistency (substantial heterogeneity) and imprecision (wide CI).</P>
<P>For carbapenems versus non-carbapenems we also assessed the quality of evidence for four outcomes: mortality rate, clinical cure in the ITT population, clinical cure in the clinically evaluable population, and adverse events. We downgraded the quality of evidence for the outcome, mortality rate, to moderate because of serious imprecision due to a wide confidence interval. Only <LINK REF="STD-Freire-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Freire 2010</LINK> reported mortality as an outcome. We downgraded the quality of evidence for the outcome, clinical cure in the ITT population, from high to moderate due to high risk of bias. We downgraded the quality of evidence for the clinically evaluable population from high to moderate for failure to meet optimal information size. We downgraded the quality of evidence for adverse events from high to low for serious imprecision due to a wide confidence interval and serious risk of bias.</P>

<P>Empiric broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy is a cornerstone for treating VAP. American Thoracic Society/Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines recommend broad-spectrum monotherapy to cover both methicillin-resistant <I>S aureus</I> (MRSA) and <I>Pseudomonas</I> in patients with risk factors for multidrug-resistant pathogens receiving treatment in units with low prevalence rates of MRSA and resistant Gram-negatives. The American Thoracic Society/Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines also recommend broad-spectrum combination therapy with an agent active against MRSA and at least two agents active against Gram-negative organisms in patients with risk factors for multidrug-resistant pathogens and in units with high prevalence rates of MRSA and <I>Pseudomonas</I> (<LINK REF="REF-ATS-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">ATS 2016</LINK>). These guidelines are supported by epidemiologic data from the USA which revealed a high prevalence of resistant <I>S aureus</I> and <I>Pseudomonas</I> species in patients with culture positive VAP (<LINK REF="REF-Kollef-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kollef 2005</LINK>). In addition, studies have demonstrated worse outcomes when appropriate antibiotic therapy is delayed (<LINK REF="REF-Alvarez_x002d_Lerma-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alvarez-Lerma 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Garnacho_x002d_Montero-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Garnacho-Montero 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Iregui-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Iregui 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rello-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rello 2007</LINK>). A meta-analysis by <LINK REF="REF-Kuti-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kuti 2008</LINK> supports the use of early broad-spectrum antibiotics by reporting increased mortality in patients receiving inappropriate empiric therapy. On the other hand, overuse of broad-spectrum antibiotics may lead to increased costs and increased resistance. There are few data comparing empiric monotherapy with combination therapy in VAP or evaluating the best empiric therapy.</P>
<P>In an observational cohort study, <LINK REF="REF-Garnacho_x002d_Montero-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Garnacho-Montero 2007</LINK> evaluated monotherapy versus combination therapy for <I>Pseudomonas</I> VAP in Spain. They reported that inappropriate therapy was associated with increased mortality. However, a Cox proportional hazard regression analysis found effective monotherapy was not associated with increased mortality when controlling for disease severity. This supports the use of effective monotherapy in VAP. <LINK REF="STD-Heyland-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Heyland 2008</LINK> studied empiric monotherapy including meropenem with combination therapy of meropenem and ciprofloxacin for late-onset VAP in Canada and the USA.

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2016-10-17 00:37:51 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The 2005 American Thoracic Society/Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines promoted a combination of three different classes of antibiotics to treat patients with ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) at risk for multidrug-resistant bacteria. Those guidelines and the classification of health care associated-pneumonia (HCAP) was supported by a retrospective cohort study characterising the epidemiology of patients with culture positive community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), HCAP, hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), and VAP in the first five days of hospital admission (<LINK REF="REF-Kollef-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kollef 2005</LINK>). Patients with culture positive VAP grew <I>S aureus</I> 42.5% of the time; methicillin-resistant <I>S aureus</I> (MRSA) grew 14.6%; <I>S pneumoniae</I> grew 8.6%: <I>Pseudomonas</I> species grew 21.2%; <I>Haemophilus</I> species grew 12.2%. However, cultures in VAP do not necessarily discriminate between pathologic infections versus colonisation, leading to a significant amount of false positives. <LINK REF="REF-Schreiber-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schreiber 2010</LINK> found the HCAP criteria to have poor sensitivity (78%) and specificity (56%) for predicting pneumonia due to a resistant organism. In addition, they may promote over-prescribing, resulting in antibiotic resistance. Indeed, <LINK REF="REF-Magill-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Magill 2014</LINK> noted an increased use of broad-spectrum antibiotics in hospitals across the USA since the promotion of guidelines in healthcare delivery. This concept of HCAP introduced in the 2005 American Thoracic Society/Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines was removed from the 2016 HAP/VAP guidelines due to evidence from numerous subsequent studies demonstrating that patients defined as having HCAP are not at high risk of multidrug-resistant pathogens (<LINK REF="REF-ATS-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">ATS 2016</LINK>).</P>
<P>These same guidelines recommend monotherapy for patients with VAP and those at low risk for multidrug-resistant bacteria. This may lead to clinical treatment failures and worse outcomes. This Cochrane Review and meta-analysis did not find a difference between monotherapy and combination therapy for treatment. Combination therapy can be associated with increased risk of resistance and cost. Without evidence for improvement in clinical cure with the use of combination therapy, this review lends support to the use of effective monotherapy for the treatment of VAP. Since the studies did not identify patients with increased risk for multidrug-resistant bacteria, these data may not be generalisable to all patient groups. Additionally, the quality of the evidence was low and the number and size of trials were small, which limits the meaningful clinical application. However, this is the largest meta-analysis comparing monotherapy to multiple antibiotic therapies for VAP, and contributes further evidence to the safety of using effective monotherapy for the empiric treatment of VAP.</P>
<P>We were unable to evaluate which antibiotic is the best choice for the treatment of people with VAP. However, carbapenems as a class may result in better clinical cure than piperacillin-tazobactam, tigecycline, or levofloxacin in certain populations.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2016-10-11 11:36:16 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Dooley">
<P>Further studies are needed to develop more effective clinical predictors of VAP due to multidrug-resistant antimicrobials to help guide optimal empiric therapy. Since no current antibiotic covers MRSA and multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacillus, predictors of multidrug-resistant pathogens will help determine which patients would benefit from combination therapy. Prospective studies should evaluate the efficacy of monotherapy for Gram-negative bacillus that tend to develop multidrug-resistance, for example, <I>Serratia</I> species, <I>Pseudomonas</I> species, <I>Acinetobacter</I> species, <I>Citrobacter</I> species, and <I>Enterobacter</I> species. In particular, carbapenems should be evaluated in prospective randomised studies to determine if, as a class, they are preferable to more restrictive antibiotics or combination therapy.</P>

<P>The author team changed between publishing of the protocol and writing the review.</P>
<P>We changed our inclusion criteria from double-blind randomised control trials (RCTs) to all RCTs because double-blinding was not common in papers studying treatment of people with ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). We determined the lack of blinding of patients to be low risk since all patients would be sedated while ventilated. We did not classify the antibiotics into classes since this did not increase the overlap in studies for meta-analysis. We also did not perform any subgroup analysis for late versus early VAP since we did not identify any studies providing late VAP data.</P>
<P>A study we identified compared tigecycline to imipenem, therefore tigecycline was added to <LINK TAG="CRIT_INTERVENTIONS" TYPE="SECTION">Types of interventions</LINK> in the <LINK TAG="METHODS" TYPE="SECTION">Methods</LINK> section.</P>
<P>The protocol specified only all-cause mortality as the primary outcome (<LINK REF="REF-Selim-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Selim 2010</LINK>). The current author team considered clinical cure to be equally relevant and this was added as a second primary outcome.</P>
<P>
<BR/>We also added length of intensive care unit (ICU) stay as a secondary outcome because this is a relevant economic outcome. We recorded this outcome using continuous variables, weighted means and standard deviation (SD) of means. Where medians and percentile points of the effect estimate were reported, we used the formula developed by <LINK REF="REF-Hozo-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hozo 2005</LINK> to calculate medians and SDs.</P>
<P>We performed GRADE analysis and created SoF tables that were not mentioned in the protocol. </P>

</P>
<P>"Patients were eligible for admission to the study if they were over 18 years of age, receiving mechanical ventilation and diagnosed with pneumonia in accordance with the following criteria: appearance of new and persistent radiological infiltrates or spread of previous infiltrates, unrelated to any other diagnosis, associated with the presence of one or more of the following signs and symptoms: presence of purulent secretions; leukocytosis (&gt; 10,000 leukocytes/mm³) or leukopenia (&lt; 5000 leukocytes/mm³); fever (temperature above 38.2°C) or hypothermia (below 36.0°C). In all cases, written consent to participate in the study was obtained from the patient or their legal representative."</P>
<P>
<B>Exclusion criteria:</B>
</P>
<P>"Patients were excluded from the study if they had received antibacterial treatment active against the pathogens responsible for the pneumonia in the 72 hours prior to the initial administration of the study medication, except where the infectious process had developed to the detriment of the patient, or if concomitant antimicrobial treatment active against the pathogens responsible for the pneumonia was necessary. Patients were also excluded if they had known hypersensitivity to either the study medication or to any other beta-lactam. Other exclusion criteria included renal insufficiency, impaired hepatic function, leukopenia (&lt; 500 cells/mm³) and pregnancy or lactation. In addition, patients were excluded if they had a life expectancy of less than one month, or a &#8220;do not resuscitate&#8221; order existed in case of cardiac arrest."</P>

<B>Microbiological diagnosis:</B>
</P>
<P>"Deep respiratory samples were obtained before commencing the study. One of the following three techniques was considered acceptable for obtaining respiratory samples: simple tracheal aspiration by endotracheal tube; protected bronchial brush; or bronchoalveolar lavage. All techniques were performed &#8220;blind&#8221; or directed by fibreoptic bronchoscopy. The etiology of the pneumonia was confirmed when the cultures from at least one of these techniques produced bacteria. A concentration of at least 10&#8309; colony forming units (cfu)/mL was required for the samples obtained by endotracheal aspiration, at least 10³ cfu/mL for those obtained by bronchial brush and at least 10&#8308; cfu/mL in those obtained by bronchoalveolar lavage."</P>

<B>Inclusion criteria:</B>
</P>
<P>&#8220;Patients hospitalised for &#8805; 72 hours and having undergone mechanical ventilation for at least 48 hours were eligible for inclusion in the study when clinically suspected of having VAP.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;The protocol required that one or several specific sampling techniques, followed by quantitative cultures, be used before inclusion of a patient in the study. Any one of the following three techniques was considered acceptable for obtaining respiratory tract secretions: bronchoalveolar lavage [23], protected specimen brush sampling via bronchoscopy [24], or protected telescoping catheter sampling performed blindly or via fibreoptic bronchoscopy [25].&#8221;</P>
<P>
<B>Exclusion criteria:</B>
</P>
<P>&#8220;Patients were not eligible if they were diagnosed as having AIDS, a hematologic malignancy, or severe neutropenia (&lt; 500 polymorphonuclear cells/mm³) or had a history of documented allergy to &#946;-lactam antibiotics. Likewise, patients were not eligible ( l ) if death was expected within 7 days of inclusion or a do-not-resuscitate order had been written or (2) if they had a severity score (simplified acute physiology [SAPS 11] score) [20] on inclusion higher than 50 and three or more organ failures [21] or a rapidly fatal underlying disease [22]. In addition, patients with suspected or documented tuberculosis, suspected or documented infection due to MRSA only, or a concomitant infection requiring other antimicrobial therapy (or that had necessitated the recent [&lt;48 hours previously] introduction of antibiotics) were not eligible.&#8221;</P>
<P>
<B>Secondary exclusion criteria:</B>
</P>
<P>&#8220;Although therapy was often initiated because of a clinical suspicion of VAP , only patients with microbiologically confirmed VAP were subsequently retained in the primary efficacy analysis.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Patients whose samples yielded MRSA only were also secondarily excluded. However, patients having infection caused by both MRSA and other organisms susceptible to the assigned study drug regimen were given vancomycin in addition and were retained in the efficacy analysis.&#8221;</P>
<P>
<B>Diagnostic criteria:</B>
</P>
<P>&#8220;The criteria for clinical suspicion of VAP included all of the following: clinical signs of sepsis (new fever, increase in temperature over 38.2°C, or decrease below 36.5°C; and increase in WBC count to &gt; 10,000/mm³); purulent tracheal aspirates; and a new infiltrate or otherwise unexplained persistence or worsening of preexisting infiltrates on chest radiographs.&#8221;</P>

<UL>
<LI>&#8220;For purposes of analysis, three populations were defined: (1) the overall evaluable population, including all patients randomised and receiving at least one dose of the treatment regimen according to the protocol (this population was analysed for assessment of the safety of the two regimens); (2) patients with VAP, including all patients with microbiologically confirmed VAP; and (3) patients evaluable as "per protocol,'' including all patients with microbiologically confirmed VAP not due exclusively to MRSA and who had no major protocol violation.&#8221;</LI>
<LI>"Cure was defined as complete or partial resolution of clinical signs and symptoms of pneumonia at the end of therapy, with no need for further antibiotic therapy during the 6-8 days of follow-up. Failure was defined as the need for a change in therapy during treatment or follow-up (including because of an adverse event); persistence, worsening, or relapse of clinical symptoms of VAP, whether or not associated with microbiological failure (i.e., documented persistence, relapse, reinfection, or superinfection); and/or death possibly or probably related to infection. Death was considered possibly or probably related to infection when it occurred during therapy or during the follow-up period and was not due to an intercurrent event unrelated to the infection."</LI>

<BR/>
</P>
<P>A) <I>Clinical outcome: all patients with VAP</I>
</P>
<P>&#8220;the overall success rate was 48% in the T<I>AZ </I>group and 33% in the CAZ group (OR, 2.14; 95% CI, 0.5%-29.5%).&#8221;</P>
<P>B) <I>Clinical outcome: per-protocol analysis</I>
</P>
<P>&#8220;26 TAZ recipients (51%) and 23 CAZ recipients (36%) had a successful clinical and bacteriologic outcome, as assessed by the CEC; the difference in efficacy rate was 15% (OR, 1.85; 95% CI, -0.2%- 30.2%), favouring TAZ recipients. Since the difference in efficacy rate did not exceed 15%, the two regimens were found to be of equivalent clinical efficacy, according to the hypothesis tested.&#8221;</P>
<P>
<B>Secondary outcomes:</B>
</P>
<P>A) <I>Treatment failures</I>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>&#8220;Therapy failed for 25 (49%) and 40 (62.5%) of the TAZ and CAZ recipients, respectively&#8221; &#8220;there were 8 and 7 nonmicrobiologically documented clinical failures in the two groups (TAZ versus CAZ), ascribed to persistent or worsening clinical features of VAP leading to a change in antimicrobial therapy, and 17 and 33 failures, respectively, were associated with a poor microbiological outcome. Although the overall distribution of causes of failures was not different (P = .12), microbiological failures tended to occur less often with TAZ (33% versus 51%; OR, 0.47; P = .05, <I>x2 </I>test).&#8221;</LI>
<LI>" Infection caused by organisms primarily resistant to the study drugs occurred at similar frequency with both regimens; all such patients were rapidly shifted to another therapy when the susceptibility data were obtained. Among patients remaining in the study, the rates of clinical and microbiological failures were 12/46 versus 27/58, respectively, for TAZ and CAZ recipients (P = .023). This higher rate of failure recorded for CAZ recipients was essentially due to a twofold higher rate of lower respiratory tract superinfection (21% versus 9%) and of persistence or relapse of infection with the initially infecting organisms (21% versus 9%)."</LI>
<LI>" Factors associated by univariate analysis with failure of therapy in the per-protocol population were a rapidly or ultimately fatal underlying disease (P = .02) and the in vitro susceptibility of etiologic organisms to the therapy administered (P = .02); the treatment group was not significant (P = .12). Variables not associated with outcome of therapy were the inclusion SAPS II score, creatinine level, age, delay of onset of pneumonia, prior antibiotic use, Pao2/Fio2 ratio, or a microbial etiology (and presence) of P. aeruginosa. There was no association between duration of therapy and superinfection rates."</LI>
<LI>"After correction for interactions between variables and for confounding factors, variables predicting a clinical failure that were retained in the multivariate model (at a P level of <B>&#8804;</B> 10) were the severity of the underlying disease (OR, 2.83; 95% CI, 1.1-7.25; P = .03), in vitro resistance to the drug regimen received (OR, 2.16; 95% CI, 1.18-3.97; P = .01), a shorter delay of onset of pneumonia (OR, 0.96 per day; 95% CI, 0.92- 1.0; P = .10), and treatment with ceftazidime (OR, 1.99; 95% CI, 0.88-4.54; P = .10)."</LI>
<LI>"To further examine causes of failure during therapy, we restricted this analysis to evaluable patients who had confirmed VAP caused by organisms found susceptible in vitro to the administered &#946;-lactam drug and who were not shifted to another therapy because of primary resistance; patients co infected with methicillin-resistant staphylococci (n = 4) were excluded. In this subgroup of 99 patients, factors associated with a poor outcome of therapy were again the severity of underlying disease (OR, 2.68; 95% CI, 1.04- 6.88; P = .041) and a shorter duration of mechanical ventilation before VAP (OR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.89-1.0; P = .051); the trend toward a higher risk of treatment failure with ceftazidime therapy was confirmed (OR, 2.33; 95% CI, 0.99- 5.48; P = .052)."</LI>

<UL>
<LI>&#8220;In the per-protocol population (n = 115), mortality at 6-8 days post-therapy was 14% in both groups, with 4 and 7 deaths attributed to infection in T<I>AZ </I>and CAZ recipients, respectively&#8221;</LI>
<LI>Per-protocol &#8220;28 days postrandomisation, mortality was 16% (TAZ group) and 20% (CAZ group), and the probability of survival at 28 days was similar <I>(P </I>= .55) in the two groups&#8221;</LI>
<LI>" The overall 30-days-post-therapy mortality rate among all evaluable patients was 18.4% (18 of 98) in the TAZ group and 22.2% (22 of 99) in the CAZ group (P = .55)."</LI>
</UL>
<P>C) <I>Safety</I>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>&#8220;All 197 patients evaluable for safety received at least 2 days of therapy; 35% were treated for 2- 7 days only, whereas 28% received therapy for &gt; 15 days. Adverse events were recorded in 37 of 98 TAZ recipients (49 events) and 38 of 99 CAZ recipients (46 events); the adverse events were judged severe in 24 TAZ and 17 CAZ recipients. The frequency and distribution by site of all adverse events recorded were similar in both groups.&#8221;</LI>
<LI>"Nine TAZ recipients and 10 CAZ recipients had adverse events judged as definitely, possibly, or probably related to the test drug (18% and 22%; P = .68), including (in TAZ and CAZ recipients, respectively) hypereosinophilia (1 and 0), leukopenia (1 and 0), skin reactions (0 and 3), alteration in renal function (3 and 2), gastrointestinal tract disorder (1 and 0), and liver test abnormalities (4 and 4); treatment was interrupted because of a nonfatal adverse event in 3 and 4 patients, respectively."</LI>

Total daily dosages of imipenem were at the discretion of the investigator dependent upon the severity of the infection and the presence of known or suspected organisms, and the doses of imipenem and the adjunctive therapies could be adjusted based upon weight and/or the calculated creatinine CL. If needed for double coverage of P. aeruginosa, an aminoglycoside could be added to either regimen.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Placebo treatments were administered at appropriate time points to ensure blinding of the treatment regimens. For adjunctive therapies, again to maintain blinded conditions, vancomycin or placebo was given in 12-h multiples, based on renal function. Similarly, ceftazidime or placebo was administered every 8 h or every 12 h. Because an aminoglycoside was allowed for patients randomised to tigecycline or imipenem/cilastatin, blinding of that agent was not required.&#8221;</P>

<LI>"Nausea (15.4% of patients) and vomiting (12.6% of patients) occurred significantly more often in the tigecycline group (P &lt; 0.001) and were generally considered by the investigator to be treatment related. Diarrhea occurred with significantly greater frequency (P &lt; 0.05) in the imipenem/cilastatin group (15%) versus the tigecycline group (10.5%). An AE of Clostridium difficile infection was reported for 1 patient in the tigecycline treatment group and for 4 patients in the imipenem/cilastatin treatment group."</LI>
<LI>"Other statistically significant differences noted between the 2 treatment groups were a greater percentage of patients in the tigecycline group versus the imipenem/cilastatin group with prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (3.9% versus 1.5%, P = 0.041), increased blood urea nitrogen (3.4% versus 1.3%, P = 0.050), somnolence (2.1% versus 0.4%, P = 0.037), and skin ulcer (e.g., pressure ulcers or bed sores; 5.8% versus 2.6%, P = 0.021). Despite these differences, there was no increase in bleeding diathesis, anemia, or renal dysfunction in the tigecycline group. Significantly, more patients in the imipenem/cilastatin group versus the tigecycline group reported headaches (4.9% versus 1.9%, P = 0.018) and dizziness (2.8% versus 0.9%, P = 0.047)."</LI>

In the tigecycline group, 41/336 (12.2%) of the non-VAP and 25/131 (19.1%) of the VAP patients died, whereas 43/345 (12.5%) and 15/122 (12.3%) of non-VAP and VAP patients, respectively, died in the imipenem/cilastatin group. The differences in mortality rates between treatment groups were not statistically different, including the differences in VAP patients (P = 0.168)."</LI>

Respiratory failure was reported as an outcome of death in 2.8% of imipenem/ cilastatin- compared with 1.1% of tigecycline-treated patients, but this difference was not statistically significant. Only 3 deaths were considered by the investigator to be related to the study drug: 1 patient in the tigecycline group who died from pneumonia and 2 in the imipenem/cilastatin group (1 each from thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura and cardiac insufficiency)."</LI>

Overall discontinuation rates due to an AE were significantly (P = 0.028) higher in the tigecycline (10.9%) compared with the imipenem/cilastatin treatment group (6.6%). This difference generally relates to cure/ failure rates and progression/complications of underlying diseases. Median time to discontinuation was 2.0 days for both treatment groups. AEs leading to discontinuation of treatment in 3 or more patients in the tigecycline group were pneumonia (5 patients, 1.1%), respiratory failure (4 patients, 0.9%), and peritonitis, vomiting, septic shock, and heart arrest (3 patients each, 0.6%). In the imipenem/cilastatin group, 3 patients (0.6%) discontinued due to rash.

<LI>"Of the 924 patients in the mITT population with laboratory data, 749 (81.1%) had an on-therapy laboratory test result considered to be of potential clinical importance based on predefined criteria. For individual laboratory tests, significantly more tigecycline-treated patients than imipenem/cilastatin-treated patients had potentially clinically important elevations in urea (12/341, 3.5%, versus 3/310, 1.0%; P = 0.036). This finding is not unexpected based on previous clinical studies of tigecycline. The mean decrease from baseline in heart rate at the final on-therapy visit was significantly greater (P = 0.036) for the tigecycline treatment group compared with the imipenem/cilastatin treatment group. No other significant differences in vital signs were noted between the 2 groups."</LI>

<B>&#8220;</B>An Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) was established to evaluate data related to efficacy and safety at predefined time points. At their last meeting, the IDMC reviewed available data from approximately half the total number of patients targeted for enrolment and recommended that the enrolment be terminated because of inferior efficacy and higher mortality in one of the treatment arms. Therefore, the analyses were based on data from the 274 subjects who had been randomised into the study at the time enrolment was terminated.&#8221;</LI>
<LI>&#8220;In addition, five sites (three in Guatemala, one in Germany, one in the United States) that enrolled a total of 41 patients were deemed to be non-compliant with good clinical practices prior to database lock and were excluded from the primary analyses of efficacy and safety (Figure 1). However, to assess the robustness of the primary efficacy and safety conclusions, sensitivity analyses were performed by including patients from these five sites. These sensitivity analyses support the primary efficacy and safety conclusions.&#8221;</LI>

Eligible patients had a new or progressive infiltrate on chest radiograph; either fever, hypothermia, or changes in peripheral white blood cell (WBC) count attributable to infection (i.e. &#8805; 10 000/mm³, &gt; 15% immature forms regardless of WBC count, or leukopenia); and if intubated, a clinical pulmonary infection score (CPIS) &#8805; 5 (where the maximum score was 11). In addition, patients had either respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation or at least two of the following signs and symptoms: cough; new-onset production of purulent sputum or other respiratory secretions, or a change in the character of sputum; auscultatory findings of rales or evidence of pulmonary consolidation; dyspnea, tachypnoea, or respiratory rate &#8805; 30/min; and hypoxemia with a partial oxygen pressure &lt; 60 mm Hg while breathing room air. All patients or their legally acceptable representatives provided written informed consent.&#8221;</P>
<P>
<B>Exclusion criteria:</B>
</P>
<P>&#8220;Patients were excluded from entry into the study if the NP was known (prior to the study) to be caused by pathogens resistant to either meropenem (used as a surrogate for doripenem) or piperacillin/tazobactam (other than methicillin-resistant S. aureus [MRSA]). Patients were also excluded if they required concomitant systemic antimicrobial therapy (other than vancomycin or amikacin) in addition to study drug, or had received systemic antibiotic therapy for &#8805; 24 h in the 72-h period before randomisation to study drug (unless they failed prior therapy for NP or developed symptoms of pneumonia with a new pulmonary infiltrate while receiving the prior antibiotic regimen).</P>
<P>Other exclusion criteria were: Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) scores 28 &lt; 8 or &gt; 25, mechanical ventilation for &#8805;5 days, presence of known bronchial obstruction or history of postobstructive pneumonia (other than chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), cavitary lung disease, primary lung cancer or another malignancy with lung metastases, adult respiratory distress syndrome, cystic fibrosis, Pneumocystis jiroveci (carinii) pneumonia, Legionella infection, active tuberculosis, immunocompromising illness, need for dialysis, and any rapidly progressive disease or immediately life-threatening illness. Patients with significant liver function abnormalities, neutropenia, or thrombocytopenia were excluded, as were those with a history of moderate or severe hypersensitivity to &#946;-lactam antibiotics or &#946;-lactamase inhibitors. Treatment with &gt;1 dose of piperacillin/tazobactam or a carbapenem for the current infection, or treatment with an investigational drug or device within the previous 30-day period, was prohibited.&#8221;</P>

<B>Intervention A:</B>
</P>
<P>&#8220;Doripenem 500 mg every 8 h was administered as a 60-min IV infusion.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;The dosage of doripenem was adjusted to 250mg every 8h or every 12h for patients with a calculated CrCL of 30&#8211;50 mL/min or 10&#8211;29 mL/min, respectively.&#8221;</P>
<P>
<B>Intervention B:</B>
</P>
<P>&#8220;piperacillin/tazobactam 4.5g every 6h was given as a 30-min IV infusion&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;the dosage of piperacillin/ tazobactam was adjusted to 3.375 g or 2.25 g every 6 h for patients with CrCL of 20&#8211;40 mL/min or 520 mL/min, respectively&#8221;</P>
<P>
<B>All interventions:</B>
</P>
<P>&#8220;The IV study drug was administered for at least 72h (i.e., nine doses of doripenem or 12 doses of piperacillin/tazobactam), and then patients could be switched to oral levofloxacin 750 mg once daily if they met all four of the following criteria: afebrile for at least 24h (without need for aspirin, acetaminophen, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or corticosteroids); WBC count &#8804; 15 000 cells/mm2 or a decrease in WBC count by 25% from the peak; absence or improvement of signs and symptoms of pneumonia compared with predosing; and improvement or lack of progression of chest X-ray findings. An alternative oral antibiotic could be selected based on the susceptibility of the isolated pathogen or patient intolerance.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Vancomycin could be added at the discretion of the investigator if MRSA was suspected but was to be discontinued if MRSA was not confirmed by culture results. Because the addition of an aminoglycoside is recommended with piperacillin/tazobactam therapy in patients at risk for P. aeruginosa infection (according to specific country labeling or guidelines), amikacin was recommended in both treatment arms to ensure balance. If P. aeruginosa was not confirmed by culture, amikacin was to be discontinued. However, if P. aeruginosa was isolated, amikacin was continued for approximately 5 days in patients assigned to the piperacillin/tazobactam arm. It could be discontinued, however, in the doripenem arm if the patient improved clinically and if the P. aeruginosa isolate was susceptible to meropenem.&#8221;</P>

<P>&#8220;Although this was an open-label study, in-house blinding procedures were implemented by the sponsor to ensure that the data were assessed objectively post hoc.

<DESCRIPTION>
<P>&#8220;Of 204 patients randomised in the study, 197 received at least one dose of either drug regimen tested according to the protocol and were evaluable with regard to tolerance (98 TAZ and 99 <I>CAZ </I>recipients); 127 patients (64.5%) had microbiologically confirmed VAP (58 TAZ and 69 CAZ recipients). From this group, 12 patients were excluded because of infection caused by MRSA only (n = 5) or because of a major protocol violation (n = 7), i.e., use of concomitant antimicrobial therapy not allowed by the protocol. Thus, 115 patients (51 TAZ and 64 CAZ recipients) with confirmed VAP were evaluable as per-protocol, according to the CEC.&#8221;</P>

<P>"Of the 979 patients screened, 34 were screen failures. A total of 945 patients comprised the randomised (ITT) population. A total of 934 patients (467 in each treatment group) were randomly assigned and received at least 1 dose of assigned treatment, comprising the modified intent-to- treat (mITT or safety) population. Of these, the CE subset of patients included 268 patients treated with tigecycline and 243 patients treated with imipenem/cilastatin (Fig. 1). The most common reasons for exclusion from the CE population (n = 358) were that patients received more than 24 h of antibiotics before the first dose of study medication without having failed that regimen (23.6%) and that patients did not have a clinical response evaluation at the TOC visit (10.1%)."</P>

<P>&#8220;A total of 448 patients were randomised to study treatment, including 225 patients (50.2%) to doripenem and 223 patients (49.8%) to piperacillin/tazobactam (Figure 1). Of the 444 patients treated, 382 (86%) completed IV study drug therapy, including 195 (87.4%) in the doripenem arm and 187 (84.6%) in the piperacillin/tazobactam arm; 177 of 444 (39.9%) were switched to oral antibiotic therapy. A total of 195 patients in the ITT population were excluded from the clinically evaluable population (Table 1), principally because of a missing or indeterminate clinical outcome assessment at the TOC visit, use of concomitant antibiotic therapy, and isolation of only resistant pathogens at baseline. The reasons for excluding patients from the evaluable populations and for discontinuations of IV study drug therapy were similar between the two treatment arms.&#8221;</P>
