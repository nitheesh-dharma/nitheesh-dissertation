<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2014-08-05 11:27:49 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We reviewed the evidence about the benefits and harms of colchicine in acute gout up to April 2014 and identified two trials. One trial included 43 participants and compared high-dose colchicine (1 mg of colchicine followed by 0.5 mg every two hours until the attack resolved or participants had side effects (total dose unspecified)) to placebo. The second study included 184 participants and compared high-dose (total 4.8 mg over six hours) to low-dose colchicine (total 1.8 mg over one hour) and high or low-dose colchicine to placebo.<BR/>
</P>
<P>
<B>What is gout and what is colchicine?</B>
<BR/>
</P>
<P>Gout is a very common cause of inflammatory arthritis (pain, redness, warmth and swelling of affected joints) and is caused by urate crystals forming either within or around joints. Uric acid is a normal waste product that is usually excreted with urine. However, in the case of gout, there is either excessive production of uric acid, or the body is not able to excrete it quickly enough, or a combination of both. An attack of gout usually occurs rapidly and usually resolves within 7 to 10 days.</P>
<P>Colchicine is a drug that is used mainly in gout to treat an acute attack or to prevent an attack while starting uric acid-lowering therapy.<BR/>
</P>
<P>
<B>Best estimate of what happens to people with gout who use high-dose colchicine compared to a fake medication (placebo) after 32 to 36 hours:</B>
</P>
<P>
<B>Pain:</B>
<BR/>- 52 people out of 100 who used high-dose colchicine rated their pain 50% lower compared to 24 people out of 100 who used placebo (28% absolute difference).</P>
<P>
<B>Side effects:</B>
<BR/>- 84 people out of 100 who used high-dose colchicine had side effects (such as diarrhoea, vomiting or nausea) compared to 22 people out of 100 who used placebo (62% absolute difference).</P>
<P>
<B>Inflammation (redness and swelling of the joint):</B>
</P>
<P>- 50 people out of 100 who used high-dose colchicine rated their inflammation 50% lower compared to 5 people out of 100 who used a placebo (45% absolute difference).</P>
<P>
<B>Best estimate of what happens to people with gout who use low-dose colchicine compared to a fake medication (placebo) after 32 to 36 hours:</B>
</P>
<P>
<B>Pain:</B>
</P>
<P>- 42 people out of 100 who used low-dose colchicine rated their pain 50% lower compared to 17 people out of 100 who used placebo (25% absolute difference).</P>
<P>
<B>Side effects:</B>
</P>
<P>- 26 people out of 100 who used low-dose colchicine had side effects (such as diarrhoea, vomiting or nausea) compared to 20 people out of 100 who used placebo (6% absolute difference).</P>
<P>
<B>Best estimate of what happens to people with gout who use high-dose colchicine compared to low-dose colchicine after 32 to 36 hours:</B>
</P>
<P>
<B>Pain:</B>
</P>
<P>- 37 people out of 100 who used high-dose colchicine rated their pain 50% lower compared to 42 people out of 100 used low-dose colchicine (this may have happened by chance).</P>
<P>
<B>Side effects:</B>
</P>
<P>- 77 people out of 100 who used high-dose colchicine had side effects (such as diarrhoea, vomiting or nausea) compared to 26 people out of 100 who used low-dose colchicine (51% absolute difference).</P>
<P>We do not know how many people dropped out of the studies due to side effects, or whether they had any changes in inflammation (joint swelling/erythema/ tenderness), function of the target joint, patient global assessment or health-related quality of life, because this was not reported in the studies that compared low-dose to placebo or high-dose to low-dose colchicine.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
</P>
<P>This review shows that in people with acute gout:</P>
<P>- There is low-quality evidence that treatment of acute gout with high-dose colchicine may reduce pain, swelling, redness and tenderness.</P>
<P>- There is low-quality evidence that high-dose colchicine may have little or no difference in decreasing pain compared to low-dose colchicine.</P>
<P>- There is low-quality evidence that low-dose colchicine has fewer side effects such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea than high-dose colchicine.</P>
<P>Further research is very likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and is likely to change the estimate.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2014-08-05 11:16:33 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2006. Gout is one of the most common rheumatic diseases worldwide. Despite the use of colchicine as one of the first-line therapies for the treatment of acute gout, evidence for its benefits and harms is relatively limited.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2014-04-04 14:58:17 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>To evaluate the benefits and harms of colchicine for the treatment of acute gout.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2014-08-05 11:18:32 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We searched the following electronic databases from inception to April 2014: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE and EMBASE. We did not impose any date or language restrictions in the search. We also handsearched conference proceedings of the American College of Rheumatology and the European League against Rheumatism (2010 until 2013) and reference lists of identified studies. We searched the clinical trials register clinicaltrials.gov and the WHO trials register.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2014-07-08 15:46:32 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We considered published randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and controlled clinical trials (CCTs) evaluating colchicine therapy compared with another therapy (active or placebo) in acute gout. The primary benefit outcome of interest was pain, defined as a proportion with 50% or greater decrease in pain, and the primary harm outcome was study participants withdrawal due to adverse events. </P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2014-08-05 11:16:33 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two authors independently screened search results for relevant studies, extracted data into a standardised form and assessed the risk of bias of included studies. We pooled data if deemed to be sufficiently clinically homogeneous. We assessed the quality of the body of evidence for each outcome using the GRADE approach.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-08-05 14:42:18 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two RCTs (124 participants) were included in this updated review, including one new RCT. We considered one trial to be at low risk of bias, while we considered the newly included trial to be at unclear risk of bias. Both trials included a placebo and a high-dose colchicine arm, although the colchicine regimens varied. In one trial 0.5 mg colchicine was given every two hours until there was either complete relief of symptoms or toxicity and the total doses were not specified. In the other trial a total of 4.8 mg colchicine was given over six hours. The newly identified trial also included a low-dose colchicine arm (total 1.8 mg over one hour).</P>
<P>Based upon pooled data from two trials (124 participants), there is low-quality evidence that a greater proportion of people receiving high-dose colchicine experience a 50% or greater decrease in pain from baseline up to 32 to 36 hours compared with placebo (35/74 in the high-dose colchicine group versus 12/50 in the placebo group (risk ratio (RR) 2.16, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.28 to 3.65), with a number needed to treat to benefit (NNTB) of 4 (95% CI 3 to 12). However, the total number of adverse events (diarrhoea, vomiting or nausea) is greater in those who receive high-dose colchicine versus placebo (62/74 in the high-dose colchicine group versus 11/50 in the placebo group (RR 3.81, 95% CI 2.28 to 6.38), with a number needed to treat to harm (NNTH) of 2 (95% CI 2 to 5). Only one trial included reduction of inflammation as part of a composite measure comprising pain, tenderness, swelling and erythema, each graded on a four-point scale (none 0 to severe 3) to derive a maximum score for any one joint of 12. They reported the proportion of people who achieved a 50% reduction in this composite score. Based upon one trial (43 participants), there was low-quality evidence that more people in the high-dose colchicine group had a 50% or greater decrease in composite score from baseline up to 32 to 36 hours than people in the placebo group (11/22 in the high-dose colchicine group versus 1/21 in the placebo group (RR 10.50, 95% CI 1.48 to 74.38) and 45% absolute difference).</P>
<P>Based upon data from one trial (103 participants), there was low-quality evidence that low-dose colchicine is more efficacious than placebo with respect to the proportion of people who achieve a 50% or greater decrease in pain from baseline to 32 to 36 hours (low-dose colchicine 31/74 versus placebo 5/29 (RR 2.43, 95% CI 1.05 to 5.64)), with a NNTB of 5 (95% CI 2 to 20). There are no additional harms in terms of adverse events (diarrhoea, nausea or vomiting) with low-dose colchicine compared to placebo (19/74 and 6/29 respectively (RR 1.24, 95% CI 0.55 to 2.79)).</P>
<P>Based upon data from one trial (126 participants), there is low-quality evidence that there are no additional benefits in terms of the proportion of people achieving 50% or greater decrease in pain from baseline up to 32 to 36 hours with high-dose colchicine compared to low-dose (19/52 and 31/74 respectively (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.36). However, there were statistically significantly more adverse events in those who received high-dose colchicine (40/52 versus 19/74 in the low-dose group (RR 3.00, 95% CI 1.98 to 4.54)), with a NNTH of 2 (95% CI 2 to 3).</P>
<P>No trials reported function of the target joint, patient-reported global assessment of treatment success, health-related quality of life or withdrawals due to adverse events. We identified no studies comparing colchicine to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or other active treatments such as glucocorticoids (by any route).</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2014-08-05 11:24:58 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Based upon only two published trials, there is low-quality evidence that low-dose colchicine is likely to be an effective treatment for acute gout. We downgraded the evidence because of a possible risk of selection and reporting biases and imprecision. Both high and low-dose colchicine improve pain when compared to placebo. While there is some uncertainty around the effect estimates, compared with placebo, high-dose but not low-dose colchicine appears to result in a statistically significantly greater number of adverse events. Therefore low-dose colchicine may be the preferred treatment option. There are no trials about the effect of colchicine in populations with comorbidities or in comparison with other commonly used treatments, such as NSAIDs and glucocorticoids.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2014-08-05 11:30:20 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Gout is a disease in which monosodium urate crystals form deposits in and around the joints, which may result in painful, swollen and tender joints or soft tissues and/or tophi. The onset of acute gout is often sudden and dramatic, often beginning at night, and characterised by severe pain (<LINK REF="REF-Schumacher-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schumacher 2005</LINK>). Uric acid is a normal waste product that is usually excreted from the body. However, in the case of gout, there is either excessive production of uric acid (in a minority of people with gout) or the body is not able to excrete it quickly enough (in most people with gout), or both. This results in the formation of monosodium urate crystals. The lower extremity joints, particularly the first metatarsophalangeal joint, are most commonly affected. Other joints that can be affected include the ankle, knee, foot, hand, wrist and elbow. Usually, only one joint is affected (monoarthritis), but oligo-articular or polyarticular acute gout may also occur and is more prevalent in male hypertensive patients and in postmenopausal women (<LINK REF="REF-Kasper-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kasper 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>Gout is the most common form of inflammatory joint disease in men greater than 40 years of age, and its prevalence varies widely, since both genetic and environmental factors contribute to its incidence (<LINK REF="REF-Schumacher-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schumacher 2005</LINK>). The highest prevalence is among elderly men, with rates as high as seven per cent in men over the age of 65 years (<LINK REF="REF-Mikuls-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mikuls 2005</LINK>). Risk factors traditionally associated with gout include obesity, alcohol consumption, renal dysfunction, diuretic use and hyperuricaemia (<LINK REF="REF-Wortmann-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wortmann 2002</LINK>). Gout is traditionally perceived as a disease afflicting men, while women represent only 5% to 17% of all patients with the disease. Premenopausal gout is rare and seen mostly in women with strong family histories of the disorder (<LINK REF="REF-Kasper-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kasper 2005</LINK>). Menopause increases the risk of gout among women, whereas postmenopausal hormone therapy modestly reduces gout risk (<LINK REF="REF-Hak-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hak 2010</LINK>). Some patients recover from an acute gout attack without intervention within seven days, but the clinically significant pain associated with acute gout attacks creates a need for agents that accelerate the rate of improvement (<LINK REF="REF-Bellamy-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bellamy 1987</LINK>).</P>
<P>Resting the afflicted joint for one to two days may aid in the resolution of an attack, and less medication may be needed to bring about the resolution (<LINK REF="REF-Agudelo-1972" TYPE="REFERENCE">Agudelo 1972</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schumacher-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schumacher 2005</LINK>). Ice therapy has been suggested to reduce the pain associated with acute attacks - cold application may be a useful adjunct to the pharmacological treatment of acute gout (<LINK REF="REF-Moi-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moi 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schlesinger-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Schlesinger 2002</LINK>). Heat application to an inflamed joint may exacerbate inflammation and is not recommended (<LINK REF="REF-Dorwart-1974" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dorwart 1974</LINK>). Avoidance of triggers important in the development of gout by asymptomatic hyperuricaemic patients may reduce the frequency of attacks. Avoiding diuretics, weight gain and alcohol may lead to a decrease in the frequency of acute gout attacks (<LINK REF="REF-Tugwell-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tugwell 2004</LINK>). Dietary interventions, such as limitation of carbohydrate intake, an increased proportional intake of protein and the use of unsaturated fat, may also limit the frequency of acute gout attacks (<LINK REF="REF-Tugwell-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tugwell 2004</LINK>). Pharmacological treatments that are commonly used in the treatment of acute gouty flares include oral non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), colchicine, oral glucocorticoids and injection of glucocorticoids into the affected joint (<LINK REF="REF-Arnold-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Arnold 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Janssens-2008a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Janssens 2008a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Janssens-2008b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Janssens 2008b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schlesinger-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schlesinger 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wallace-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wallace 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wechalekar-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wechalekar 2013</LINK>). The use of adrenocorticotropic hormone may also aid in the resolution of acute gout attacks (<LINK REF="REF-Schlesinger-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schlesinger 2001</LINK>). In this review we focus on the evidence for colchicine in the treatment of acute gout.</P>

Colchicine is the main alkaloid of the poisonous autumn crocus plant and has been used to treat acute gout for over 2000 years (<LINK REF="REF-Schlesinger-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schlesinger 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>Colchicine is available in oral and intravenous form. The absorption of oral colchicine is rapid but can be highly variable. Relief of pain usually occurs 24 hours after colchicine is given orally (<LINK REF="REF-Schlesinger-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schlesinger 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>Serious systemic reactions, including bone marrow suppression, renal failure, alopecia, disseminated intravascular coagulation, hepatic necrosis, diarrhoea, seizures and death, have all been associated with intravenous colchicine (<LINK REF="REF-Wallace-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wallace 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>The most important side effects of oral colchicine are nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea and these may be particularly difficult to endure when patients are in pain and incapacitated by acute gouty arthritis (<LINK REF="REF-Morris-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morris 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>The recommended dosage of oral colchicine has been debated in the literature, and the optimal dose is not well defined (<LINK REF="REF-Cox-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cox 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Morris-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morris 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sivagnanam-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sivagnanam 2004</LINK>). Both the European League against Rheumatism (EULAR) recommendation (<LINK REF="REF-Zhang-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhang 2006</LINK>) and a more recent recommendation (<LINK REF="REF-Hamburger-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hamburger 2011</LINK>), advise the use of a low-dose colchicine regimen because of the toxicity of higher doses, but neither specify what the low-dose regimen entails. Colchicine tablets come in different strengths depending upon country of use. For example, in Australia the tablets are 0.5 mg (also expressed as 500 micrograms) and the Australian Rheumatology Association patient information leaflet for colchicine (last updated November 2012) recommends one or two tablets initially (0.5 mg to 1 mg), followed by one tablet (0.5 mg) one hour later and waiting 12 hours before taking the next tablet (<LINK REF="REF-Australian-Rheumatology-Association-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Australian Rheumatology Association 2012</LINK>). Thereafter one or two tablets can be taken daily for a couple of days to completely settle the attack. In Austria, the tablets are 0.372 mg. The dosing regimen is two tablets (0.744 mg) every two to three hours until either a maximum dose of 6 mg (i.e. 15 to 16 tablets), symptoms resolve or side effects occur. After a minimum of two to three days the course can be repeated if needed.</P>

<THEORY MODIFIED="2014-08-05 11:16:33 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The exact mechanism by which colchicine relieves the pain of an acute gouty attack is not presently known. The major pharmacological action of colchicine is its ability to bind to tubulin dimers (<LINK REF="REF-Schlesinger-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schlesinger 2004</LINK>). It prevents the polymerisation of microtubules by binding their protein subunits and preventing conglomeration &#8212; disrupting membrane-dependent functions such as chemotaxis and phagocytosis (<LINK REF="REF-Schumacher-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schumacher 1993</LINK>). Colchicine is also suspected to interfere with leukocyte function, preventing diapedesis, mobilisation, lysosomal degranulation and chemotaxis (<LINK REF="REF-Schlesinger-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schlesinger 2004</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2014-08-05 11:16:33 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The natural course of untreated gouty arthritis attacks can last from several hours to several weeks (<LINK REF="REF-Schlesinger-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schlesinger 2004</LINK>). Although rest of the affected joint and cold therapy may provide some relief of symptoms, non-pharmacological measures often fall short (<LINK REF="REF-Agudelo-1972" TYPE="REFERENCE">Agudelo 1972</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moi-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moi 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schlesinger-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Schlesinger 2002</LINK>). Therefore it is important to understand the benefits and harms of pharmacological agents.</P>
<P>Colchicine is commonly used to treat patients with mono- or oligo-articular acute gout but has potential side effects. In addition, people with gout may have clinically significant comorbidities that may influence the choice of therapy. While rheumatologic guidelines recommend use of low-dose oral colchicine for the treatment of people with acute gout, the specific dosage has not been specified. Therefore there is a need to determine the benefits and harms of high and low-dose colchicine in a systematic review and identify the optimum dosing regimen.</P>

To determine the risk of bias of a study, we evaluated the presence of sufficient information and the likelihood of potential bias for each criterion. We rated each criterion as low risk of bias, high risk of bias or unclear risk of bias (either lacking information or uncertainty over the potential for bias). In a consensus meeting of review authors we discussed and resolved any disagreements.</P>

<EFFECT_MEASURES MODIFIED="2014-08-05 11:38:44 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In order to assess benefits, if available, we extracted raw data for outcomes of interest as well as number of participants. If reported data needed to be converted or imputed, we recorded this in the notes section of the table <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>.</P>
<P>We plotted the results of each trial as risk ratios (RRs) with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for dichotomous outcomes and as mean differences (MDs) between the intervention and comparator group, with corresponding 95% CIs for continuous data. The mean difference between treated group and control group is weighted by the inverse variance in the pooled treatment estimate. However, if different scales were used to measure the same conceptual outcome (e.g. functional status or pain), we calculated standardised mean differences (SMD) instead, with corresponding 95% confidence intervals. We calculated SMDs by dividing the MD by the standard deviation, resulting in a unitless measure of treatment effect (<LINK REF="REF-Deeks-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deeks 2011</LINK>).</P>

<P>In the event that we identified cross-over trials in which the reporting of continuous outcome data precluded paired analysis, we did not plan to include these data in a meta-analysis, in order to avoid unit of analysis error.

For dichotomous outcomes (e.g. number of withdrawals due to adverse events), we calculated the withdrawal rate using the number of patients randomised in the group as the denominator (worst case scenario). For continuous outcomes (e.g. mean change in pain score), we calculated the MD or SMD based on the number of patients analysed at that time point. If the number of patients analysed was not presented for each time point, we used the number of randomised patients in each group at baseline.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">'Summary of findings' table</HEADING>
<P>The main results of the review are presented in a 'Summary of findings' table, which includes an overall grading of the evidence using the GRADE approach (GRADEpro) as described in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions </I>(<LINK REF="REF-Sch_x00fc_nemann-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schünemann 2011</LINK>). We produced a summary of the available data for the main outcomes (proportion who reported an improvement in pain by 50% or more, reduction in inflammation, function of target joint, patient global assessment, quality of life, total number of withdrawals due to adverse effects and total adverse events).</P>
<P>Grading of the evidence involves consideration of within-study risk of bias, indirectness of evidence, heterogeneity, imprecision of effect estimates and risk of publication bias. However, other factors can affect the quality of evidence, for example it can be increased by a large magnitude of effect, plausible confounding and dose-response gradients. Using this system, we planned to grade the quality of the body of evidence as 'high', 'moderate', 'low' or 'very low' (<LINK REF="REF-Atkins-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Atkins 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>In addition to the absolute and relative magnitude of effect provided in the 'Summary of findings' table, for dichotomous outcomes, we calculated the number needed to treat to benefit (NNTB) or the number needed to treat to harm (NNTH) from the control group event rate and the RR using the Visual Rx NNT calculator (<LINK REF="REF-Cates-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cates 2008</LINK>).</P>

<P>One trial was conducted in Australia, included 43 participants (40 men, three women) and compared high-dose colchicine (1 mg oral colchicine then 0.5 mg every two hours until there was either relief of pain or side effects from the drug) (n = 22) with placebo (n = 21), for acute gout attacks (<LINK REF="STD-Ahern-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Ahern 1987</LINK>). The mean (SD) total dose of colchicine given was not specified. All patients had the diagnosis of acute gout confirmed by joint aspiration and demonstration of negatively birefringent needle-shaped monosodium urate crystals under polarised light microscopy. No NSAIDs were allowed for 48 hours before or during the study.</P>
<P>Participants were assessed every six hours for 48 hours. Pain was measured on a 100-point visual analogue scale and results were reported as proportion with 50% or greater improvement in pain from baseline at 12, 24, 36 and 48 hours, while mean pain scores at six-hourly intervals to 48 hours were shown graphically only. A compound clinical score comprised of pain, tenderness, redness and swelling (on a four-point scale, 0 to 3 score recorded for each symptom, maximum compound score of 12) was also recorded and presented as proportion with 50% or greater improvement in clinical score from baseline at 12, 24, 36 and 48 hours.</P>
<P>The second trial, conducted in 54 centres in the USA, involved a total of 575 participants randomised to one of three treatment groups: low-dose colchicine (total 1.8 mg over one hour), high-dose colchicine (total 4.8 mg over six hours) or placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Terkeltaub-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Terkeltaub 2010</LINK>). Participants were included if they had a diagnosis of acute gout according to the ACR preliminary classification criteria. All randomised participants were provided with study medication and instructed to call the Gout Flare Call Center if they developed a gout flare. A gout flare was confirmed if the onset was within the prior 12 hours, four cardinal signs of inflammation were present, joint pain was assessed at 4 or more on a 0 to 10 numeric rating scale, and if there had been no use of prohibited medication or change in medical history since randomisation. One hundred and eighty-five participants had a qualifying flare (74/192 randomised to low-dose colchicine, 52/193 randomised to high-dose colchicine and 59/190 randomised to the placebo group) and 390/575 participants did not have a flare or had a 'non qualifying flare' and were not included in the analysis. Rescue medication (including NSAIDs) was permitted if intolerable pain continued after taking at least one dose of the study drug. Uric acid-lowering therapy was permitted during the study period, and was not to be discontinued at the onset of the attack.</P>
<P>Data were collected by a standardised diary to track symptoms, pain, adverse events and rescue medication use. Pain was measured on an 11-point Likert scale (0 no pain to 10 worst possible pain) at baseline, then hourly for the first eight hours and every eight hours thereafter until 72 hours following the initial dose or symptom resolution. In addition, participants were assessed in the clinic as soon as possible following the onset of the attack, with the target for the first post attack visit being within 48 hours. After attack onset there were up to three more planned visits, the last being seven days after attack onset. At the clinic any adverse events were graded as mild, moderate or severe based on the study physicians' clinical judgement. The primary outcome of this trial was the proportion of participants who responded to treatment, defined as having a reduction in pain of 50% or more from baseline within 24 hours of the first study dose. Alternate definitions of response included 1) treatment response based on the target joint pain score 32 hours after the first dose, 2) treatment response based on at least a two-unit reduction in the target joint pain score 24 hours after the first dose, and 3) treatment response based on at least a two-unit reduction in the target joint pain score 32 hours after the first dose.</P>

There did not appear to be selective reporting of outcomes although it was not clear if the criterion of improvement (50% reduction from baseline score) was pre-specified. This trial predated compulsory registration. We considered other potential sources of bias, such as baseline imbalance and inappropriate administration of a co-intervention.</P>
<P>We judged <LINK REF="STD-Terkeltaub-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Terkeltaub 2010</LINK> to be at an overall unclear risk of bias. It was described as randomised but no further details on how randomisation was done were provided. Patients and study personnel at each site were blinded to treatment but the allocation concealment was not described (<LINK REF="STD-Terkeltaub-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Terkeltaub 2010</LINK>). For benefits, only the responders' analysis was presented. The numbers of participants randomised to each group was equal but the number of participants in each group who had an acute attack of gout and therefore received treatment and had outcome data was not equal. In addition, the numbers of participants by group treated at each site was not specified, but it is stated that some sites did not have patients in all treatment groups. Trial recruitment began in April 2007 and the study was registered in July 2007. Not all outcomes that were reported to have been measured were reported. We considered other potential sources of bias, such as baseline imbalance and inappropriate administration of a co-intervention.</P>

In one trial, treatment was continued until complete response or toxicity (<LINK REF="STD-Ahern-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Ahern 1987</LINK>). All 22 participants in the high-dose colchicine group in this trial developed diarrhoea or vomiting, or both (<LINK REF="STD-Ahern-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Ahern 1987</LINK>). Median time of onset was at 24 hours (range 12 to 36 hours) or after a mean dose of 6.7 mg of colchicine. These adverse events occurred before treatment response (defined as 50% or greater reduction in pain from baseline) in 12/22 (55%), after response in 9/22 (41%) and concurrent with response in 1/22. Five participants (24%) in the placebo group developed nausea but none developed diarrhoea or vomiting, or both. <LINK REF="STD-Terkeltaub-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Terkeltaub 2010</LINK> reported that statistically significantly more people in the high-dose colchicine group had adverse events (40/52) compared with the placebo group (8/29) (RR 2.79, 95% CI 1.52 to 5.12) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>).</P>
<P>Although the risk of adverse events was likely to have been inflated in the <LINK REF="STD-Ahern-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Ahern 1987</LINK> trial, we pooled data from the two trials for gastrointestinal adverse events (diarrhoea, vomiting or nausea).

</SUBSECTION>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2014-08-05 11:59:07 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There are several treatment options for acute gout. When it comes to the use of colchicine, the overall balance of benefits and harms is key. We identified only two trials investigating the benefits and harms of colchicine here. Both trials compared high-dose colchicine to placebo while one trial also included a low-dose colchicine comparator arm. The data suggest that low-dose colchicine is as effective as higher doses of colchicine but that the risk of adverse events is lower, without any difference from placebo.</P>
<P>Colchicine and its metabolites are excreted through the urinary and biliary tracts, and the presence of renal or liver disease increases the time needed for clearance of colchicine two- to three-fold (<LINK REF="REF-Ben_x002d_Chetrit-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ben-Chetrit 1998</LINK>). This suggests that patients with either liver or renal disease may need to be closely monitored even while on low doses of colchicine. Neither trial included in this review provided baseline participant hepatic or renal function data, however, one trial did report that the risk of experiencing gastrointestinal events was similar when demographic characteristics, concomitant allopurinol use or estimated creatinine clearance was compared (<LINK REF="STD-Terkeltaub-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Terkeltaub 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>The small number of included studies and study participants means that uncommon but potentially serious adverse events may not have been detected. There have been reports of bone marrow and neuromuscular toxicity with the use of low-dose colchicine (0.5 mg twice a day) (<LINK REF="REF-Kuncl-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kuncl 1987</LINK>).</P>
<P>We found no trials of colchicine compared with other interventions, including NSAIDs and oral or intraarticular glucocorticoids. However the British National Formulary states that "colchicine is probably at least as effective as NSAIDs in treating acute attacks of gout, although no randomised controlled trials have been completed to date" (<LINK REF="REF-BNF-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">BNF 2006</LINK>). In addition, the EULAR guideline (<LINK REF="REF-Zhang-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhang 2006</LINK>) and a more recent review by Hamburger et al (<LINK REF="REF-Hamburger-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hamburger 2011</LINK>) stated that NSAIDs were equally effective for addressing the signs and symptoms of an acute gout attack, however we are unaware of any head-to-head randomised controlled trials that have examined the comparative benefits and harms of colchicine in comparison to NSAIDs.</P>
<P>Colchicine can be administered intravenously to treat attacks of acute gout. However, overdose is a serious risk, and misuse can result in toxicity, severe organ damage or death. Although no randomised controlled trials have been conducted to evaluate the benefits and harms of intravenous colchicine, most practitioners discourage its use because of the possibility of these serious and sometimes life-threatening side effects (<LINK REF="REF-Schlesinger-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schlesinger 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>Colchicine is metabolised by cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) and is also a substrate for the P-glycoprotein transporter and serious (including fatal) colchicine toxicity has been reported in patients taking standard therapeutic doses of colchicine and concomitantly prescribed medications that inhibit CYP3A4 or P-glycoprotein (these include clarithromycin, erythromycin, ketoconazole, ritonavir, verapamil and diltiazem, among others). The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommends that these drugs not be used in patients taking colchicine (particularly when there is co-existing renal of hepatic impairment) and, relatively recently, a dose reduction algorithm to predict and prevent colchicine toxicity in the presence of these drugs has been proposed (<LINK REF="STD-Terkeltaub-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Terkeltaub 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>In both included trials low-dose colchicine consisted of a total of 1.8 mg given over one hour. Current clinical practice varies and lower doses are often employed, however no trials have been performed examining lower doses.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2014-08-05 12:01:47 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Based upon only two published trials, one with a low risk of bias and one with an unclear risk of bias, there is low-quality evidence that low-dose colchicine is likely to be an effective treatment for acute gout. We downgraded the evidence because of a potential risk of selection and reporting biases, and the small number of trial participants and the low event rates indicating imprecision. Both high and low-dose colchicine improve pain when compared to placebo. While there is some uncertainty around the effect estimates, compared with placebo, high-dose but not low-dose colchicine appears to result in a statistically significantly greater number of adverse events. Therefore low-dose colchicine may be the preferred treatment option. However, in this trial low-dose is 1.8 mg colchicine in one hour, while in clinical practice we most often use 0.6 mg twice a day. From a clinical perspective the position of colchicine in the context of other therapeutic options for treatment of acute gout remains unclear. In the absence of comparative data, a patient's risk profile and comorbidities will likely influence the choice of colchicine, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or glucocorticoids in clinical practice. In some circumstances colchicine may be preferred because of the possibility of dose titration, particularly in patients at risk of side effects, but in general the relative lack of experience in the use of colchicine in clinical practice compared to other treatment modalities, such as NSAIDs and glucocorticoids, will often guide the clinician to chose one of the latter.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2014-08-05 12:02:24 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Randomised controlled trials comparing colchicine (at different doses and also the clinical dose most often used of 0.6 mg twice a day) to placebo and to the relevant alternative treatment options in acute gout (NSAIDs and glucocorticoids) would clearly benefit clinical decision-making. Such trials should ideally be pragmatic in the way that they include gout patients with all their typical comorbidities.</P>
<P>Planned trials should include participants with a range of gout manifestations (e.g. tophi, nephrolithiasis), comorbidities that influence pharmacotherapy choice for gout treatment (e.g. renal impairment, cardiovascular disease) and assess the outcomes recommended by OMERACT for studies of chronic gout, including reduction in gout attack frequency, joint pain, serum urate concentration, tophus burden, physical function and quality of life (<LINK REF="REF-Singh-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Singh 2011</LINK>). The CONSORT statement should also be used as a guide for both designing and reporting trials (<LINK REF="REF-Boutron-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boutron 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>Trial reporting should include the method of randomisation and treatment allocation concealment, blinding of study participants, study personnel and outcome assessment, follow-up of all participants who entered the trial and complete reporting of outcomes. Sample sizes should be reported and have adequate power to answer the research question; ideally trials should assess both the benefits and risks of lifestyle interventions. To enable comparison and pooling of the results of randomised controlled trials, we suggest that future trials report means with standard deviations for continuous measures or number of events and total numbers analysed for dichotomous measures, and use standardised measurement tools for reporting relevant outcomes.</P>
