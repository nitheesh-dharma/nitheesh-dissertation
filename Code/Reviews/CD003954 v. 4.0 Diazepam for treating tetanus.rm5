<P>Tetanus is a disease caused by bacteria (<I>Clostridium tetani</I>) found in soil and faeces. It can be immunised against but continues to kill children and adults. Newborn infants are the most vulnerable, particularly in Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, Nigeria and Pakistan, mainly because of unhygienic umbilical cord practices. Puncture wounds, burns, multiple ear piercing, tattooing and circumcision (male and female) can also cause tetanus infection. The symptoms include a sudden onset of muscle stiffness and spasms (involuntary contractions) in the neck, jaw and back, sufficient to cause rigid arching of the back. Glottal and laryngeal spasms may result in fluid being sucked into the breathing passages (aspiration) or inability to breathe (asphyxiation). These spasms progress over two weeks and recovery then takes some four weeks. Complications of the disease or its treatment include depressed breathing, extrapyramidal signs that mimic the tetanus spasms and rigidity, body (autonomic) dysfunction and pneumonia. Supportive nursing, nutritional support and physiotherapy are important. Mechanical ventilation is rarely available in resource poor countries to treat total paralysis. Drugs are needed to reducing the muscle spasms and rigidity, antibiotics to kill the bacteria and tetanus immunoglobulin to remove the toxins in the body. Diazepam has anticonvulsant, muscle relaxant, sedative and anxiety reducing effects. Diazepam treatment was associated with fewer deaths than was treatment with a combination of phenobarbitone and chlorpromazine. Combination treatments with diazepam did not give any further benefit (and may cause harm). The review authors searched the medical literature and identified two randomised controlled trials with a total of 134 hospitalized neonates and older children who had tetanus from Nigeria (19 neonates, seven children aged between one month and 10 years of age) and Indonesia (74 neonates, 34 children aged between three days and 12 years). All drugs were given orally as medications and feeds are usually given via nasogastric tube in the settings where the disease burden is high. Neither study provided information on the safety of the interventions or followed up survivors beyond discharge from hospital.</P>

</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Clinical management of the muscle spasms and rigidity of tetanus poses a difficult therapeutic problem to physicians everywhere, especially in resource poor countries. There are wide variations in therapeutic regimens commonly used in clinical practice due to uncertainties about effectiveness of conventional drugs. Diazepam compared to other drugs (eg phenobarbitone and chlorpromazine) may have advantages because of combined anticonvulsant, muscle relaxant, sedative and anxiolytic effects. </P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To compare diazepam to other drugs in treating the muscle spasms and rigidity of tetanus in children and adults.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>We searched the Cochrane Neonatal Group trials register (June 2004), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library, Issue 2, 2004), MEDLINE (1966 to June 2004), EMBASE (1980 to June 2004), LILACS (2004), CINAHL (June 2004), Science Citation Index, African Index Medicus, conference abstracts and reference lists of articles. We contacted researchers, experts and organizations working in the field and used personal communication.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomized and quasi-randomized controlled trials. </P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>We independently identified eligible trials, assessed trial methodological quality and extracted data.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Two studies met the inclusion criteria. Method of generation of allocation sequence, concealment of allocation and blinding were unclear in both studies. A total of 134 children were allocated to three treatment groups comprising diazepam alone, phenobarbitone and chlorpromazine, or phenobarbitone and chlorpromazine and diazepam.<BR/> <BR/>Meta-analysis of in-hospital deaths indicates that children treated with diazepam alone had a better chance of survival than those treated with combination of phenobarbitone and chlorpromazine (Relative Risk for death 0.36; 95% confidence interval 0.15 to 0.86; Risk Difference -0.22; 95% CI -0.38 to -0.06). </P>
<P>Giving diazepam alone, or supplementing conventional anticonvulsants (phenobarbitone and chlorpromazine) with diazepam, was reported in one study to be associated with a statistically significantly milder clinical course and shorter duration of hospitalization. </P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>Although this review suggests that diazepam alone compared with combination of phenobarbitone and chlorpromazine may be more effective in treating tetanus, the small size, methodological limitations and lack of data on drug safety from available trials preclude definite conclusions to support change in current clinical practice. The application of this observation should be moderated by local needs and circumstances, pending the availability of better evidence. We recommend a reinforcement of preventive measures against tetanus infection and it is hoped that in the light of clear evidence about the preventive efficacy of tetanus toxoid immunization, concerted efforts should be made towards preventive interventions and ultimate eradication such that there will not be enough case materials for a trial. In the event of a need for a trial, a large prospective, multicenter, randomized controlled trial, which compares diazepam alone with combinations of other drugs (excluding diazepam) will be ideal.</P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>

<BACKGROUND>
<P>Tetanus is a potentially fatal disease caused by a potent neurotoxin, tetanospasmin, produced by a bacterium called Clostridium tetani, which is found in soil, human and animal faeces. It is preventable and can be eradicated through immunization and hygienic obstetric practices, but continues to kill children and adults, mostly in low and medium income countries of Asia and sub Saharan Africa. It is estimated that every year 500,000 children and 50,000 adults die from tetanus worldwide (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1996</LINK>). Neonates are the most vulnerable group, and 80% of cases of neonatal tetanus occur in Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, Nigeria and Pakistan. Mortality and case fatality rates are as high as 28 per 100,000 and 80% respectively in these countries, compared with 0.1% case fatality in developed countries (<LINK REF="REF-Stanfield-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stanfield 1984</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-WHO-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1996</LINK>). Incidence of tetanus in developed countries is as low as 30 to 50 cases per annum, mostly occurring in intravenous drug addicts and elderly adults over 50 years of age, who were either inadequately or never immunized (<LINK REF="REF-Levinson-1955" TYPE="REFERENCE">Levinson 1955</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-CDC-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">CDC 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>Tetanus is transmitted by tetanus spores, which are inoculated into the body following major or minor injuries. In newborn infants, the main route of infection is through the umbilical cord, either because of cutting the cord at birth using contaminated instruments, or through unhygienic cord care practices such as the application of animal dung dressing on the umbilical cord. Acute wounds (including minor splinter punctures), burns, multiple ear piercing, tattooing and circumcision (especially female genital mutilation) may expose non-immunized individuals to tetanus infection. In 20 to 30% of cases the portal of entry is either obscure or trivial. Following inoculation, the tetanus spores germinate and produce two toxins known as tetanospasmin, which produces the characteristic features and complications of tetanus (i.e. muscle spasms and autonomic dysfunction) and tetanolysin, which causes hemolysis but otherwise plays no major role in the disease (<LINK REF="REF-Edsall-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Edsall 1976</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Willis-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Willis 1983</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Bleck-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bleck 1987</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Bleck-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bleck 1991</LINK>). </P>
<P>The diagnosis of tetanus rests primarily on clinical features. These include sudden onset of muscle stiffness (rigidity) and muscle spasms (involuntary contractions) of the neck and jaw, leading to lockjaw, feeding and speech difficulties and a characteristic facial expression, the sardonic smile (risus sardonicus). Tetanus spasms, also referred to as seizures (fits), may be either localized or generalized. Tonic spasms of muscles of the neck, back, trunk, limbs and abdomen may be associated with rigid arching of the back (opisthotonus). Glottal and laryngeal spasms may develop and these are potentially life-threatening, as they may lead to aspiration or asphyxiation. Apart from deep sedation that may be associated with use of drugs in tetanus, consciousness level is usually preserved in uncomplicated tetanus. Laboratory tests may be required to exclude other medical conditions that may mimic or complicate tetanus (<LINK REF="REF-Bleck-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bleck 1995</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Osinusi-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Osinusi 1986</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Weinstein-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weinstein 1998</LINK>). The average duration of the illness is six weeks, comprising a two-week progression period and another four weeks for recovery, which is usually complete unless complications supervene. Complications of tetanus may be due to the disease or therapeutic interventions, and include respiratory depression, autonomic dysfunction and aspiration pneumonia. Long-term neurological sequelae have been reported after tetanus disease (<LINK REF="REF-Luisto-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Luisto 1989</LINK>). </P>
<P>Generalized tetanus is the most common and most severe form of the disease. Localized tetanus is usually a mild, self-limiting illness except when it involves the head and neck (cephalic tetanus). The severity of tetanus is determined by the frequency of spasms, and the presence of opisthotonus and autonomic dysfunction. Various prognostic scoring systems exist (<LINK REF="REF-Patel-1959" TYPE="REFERENCE">Patel 1959</LINK>). For example, a scoring index to determine prognosis, at the time of admission and subsequently, was described by Hendrickse (<LINK REF="REF-Hendrickse-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hendrickse 1981</LINK>).</P>
<P>Several aspects are involved in the management of tetanus including drug treatment for the muscle spasms and rigidity, the use of antibiotics to kill the bacteria, the administration of tetanus immune globulin to remove free toxins, supportive nursing care, nutritional support, physiotherapy and active immunization with tetanus toxoid. The treatment of tetanus muscle spasms and rigidity is one of the most important aspects as it is crucial to the outcome. This poses a major challenge to physicians in low and middle-income and even developed countries, as there is no standardized, universally accepted drug regimen for treating tetanus muscle spasms and rigidity. Drugs that have been used for treating tetanus muscle spasms and rigidity include: diazepam, phenobarbitone, chlorpromazine, magnesium sulphate, vecuronium, pancuronium, and less commonly pyridoxine, morphine, baclofen, dantrolene and meprobamate. Wide variations in practice exist. Some tertiary health institutions in countries such as Nigeria use a cocktail of two or more therapeutic agents that include phenobarbitone and chlorpromazine (<LINK REF="REF-Kaine-1975" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kaine 1975</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Adedoyin--1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Adedoyin 1982</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Oruamabo-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oruamabo 1986</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Osinusi-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Osinusi 1986</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Antia_x002d_Obong-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Antia-Obong 1991</LINK>), while others use diazepam alone (<LINK REF="REF-Tompkins-1958" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tompkins 1958</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Blankson-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blankson 1977</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Grange-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grange 1991</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Okuonghae-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Okuonghae 1992</LINK>). </P>
<UL>
<LI>DIAZEPAM</LI>
</UL>
<P>Diazepam, a benzodiazepine derivative, has long been reported to be effective in the treatment of tetanus (<LINK REF="REF-Weinberg-1964" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weinberg 1964</LINK>). Subsequently, several other reports suggested that diazepam compared with other therapeutic agents offers significant benefits in the treatment of tetanus (<LINK REF="STD-Norredam-1970" TYPE="STUDY">Norredam 1970</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Joseph-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Joseph 1978</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Alvarado_x002d_Ganoza-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alvarado-Ganoza 1983</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Arrate-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Arrate 1980</LINK>). These benefits are attributed to the combined anticonvulsant and muscle relaxation actions on tetanus muscle spasms and rigidity. Also, it has sedative and anxiolytic effects. Unlike the barbiturates, diazepam, given in high doses, is reported to cause little respiratory depression (<LINK REF="REF-Nicol-1967" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nicol 1967</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Fox-1968" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fox 1968</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Dalen-1969" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dalen 1969</LINK>). Diazepam may be given orally via nasogastric tube, per rectum, or by intravenous infusion. Intramuscular diazepam is characterized by erratic absorption. Bioavailability after oral and rectal administration of diazepam is reported to be good, with almost complete absorption and peak plasma levels occurring within 30-90 minutes (<LINK REF="REF-Rey-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rey 1981</LINK>).</P>
<UL>
<LI>OTHER DRUGS</LI>
</UL>
<P>Other drugs that have been used to treat tetanus include phenobarbitone, an anticonvulsant which may have harmful side effects on the respiratory and cardiovascular systems (<LINK REF="STD-Norredam-1970" TYPE="STUDY">Norredam 1970</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Vassa-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Vassa 1974</LINK>); chlorpromazine, which in addition to its anticonvulsant effect has muscle relaxant properties but may produce extrapyramidal signs that mimic tetanus spasms and rigidity (Norredam 1970); and magnesium sulphate, found to be most beneficial when used in combination with diazepam, but which may require careful titration and/or measurement of serum magnesium to maintain serum concentrations within the therapeutic range (<LINK REF="REF-Cholst-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cholst 1984</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Bleck-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bleck 1986</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Lipman-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lipman 1987</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Attygalle-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Attygalle 1997</LINK>). In addition to the aforementioned, other drugs that have been used in treating tetanus include vecuronium, pancuronium, propofol, baclofen, mephenesin, meprobamate and antitetanus serum. These have various undesirable effects, which include respiratory depression, hepatotoxicity and haemolysis and are mostly not conventional drugs for treating tetanus especially in areas most affected by the disease (<LINK REF="REF-Gupta-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gupta 1979</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Bleck-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bleck 1995</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Hajailay-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hajailay 1983</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Rocke-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rocke 1986</LINK>).</P>
<P>The choice of therapeutic agents used in the treatment of tetanus spasms and rigidity should be based on best evidence of potential benefits and harm, but at best the efficacies of the various agents can be described as controversial. Comparisons of treatment outcomes between published studies have been difficult due to differences in study population and treatment protocols (<LINK REF="REF-Patel-1959" TYPE="REFERENCE">Patel 1959</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Gupta-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gupta 1979</LINK>). Many of the reports on beneficial therapeutic effects in tetanus are experiential in nature, based on comparisons between the outcomes of current patients with those of historical controls treated with other drugs. Many of the studies claiming therapeutic benefits are not randomized, controlled trials, which are adjudged the gold standard for best therapeutic evidence. Thus, the question of the benefits and harms of diazepam compared with other pharmacologic treatments such as phenobarbitone and chlorpromazine has remained unresolved.</P>
<P>Although tetanus predominantly affects neonates in the most vulnerable countries, randomized controlled trials based exclusively on neonates may be lacking. Existing studies may include neonates, older children and adults, and this formed the justification for not limiting this review to neonates. Furthermore, studies in which treatments involve total paralysis and mechanical ventilation will be excluded in this review because this mode of treatment is rarely available in resource poor countries most affected by tetanus disease. A separate review on the efficacy of this method of treatment is considered more appropriate.</P>
<P>There is a continuing search for an optimal treatment regime, which is safe, effective, available and affordable, and which controls muscle spasms and rigidity associated with tetanus without requiring any need for artificial ventilation. The aim of this review is to evaluate the existing evidence from controlled clinical trials concerning the benefits and harms of diazepam in the treatment of muscle spasms and rigidity in tetanus. </P>

<SEARCH_METHODS>
<P>See: Collaborative Review Group Search Strategy<BR/>We attempted to identify all relevant studies regardless of language or publication status (published, unpublished, in press, and in progress).<BR/>We searched all trial registers and databases using the search terms: tetanus and diazepam. Search terms included synonyms and trade names of diazepam such as valium, stesolid, seduxen, faustan, diazemuls, and cercin. Chemical names were not be included in the search terms.<BR/>We searched the Cochrane Neonatal Group, Cochrane Wounds Group and Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group specialized trials registers for relevant trials up to the month of June 2004. <BR/>We searched The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library, Issue 2, 2004). This contains mainly reference information to randomized controlled trials and controlled clinical trials in health care.<BR/>We searched the following electronic databases using the topic search terms in combination with search strategy for identifying trials developed by The Cochrane Collaboration and detailed in the Cochrane Reviewers' Handbook (<LINK REF="REF-Clarke-2003a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clarke 2003a</LINK>):<BR/>1) MEDLINE (1966 to June 2004) <BR/>2) EMBASE (1980 to June 2004) <BR/>3) LILACS (La Literatura Latin americana y del Caribe de information en Ciencias de Salud) 1982 to June 2004. <BR/>We contacted organizations and individuals who have worked on related research and these included: World Health Organization (Infectious Diseases and Technical Report Groups); University Departments of Paediatrics in areas currently most affected by tetanus (Africa, Asia and India); Medical Research Council, The Gambia; Kenya Medical Research Institute, Clinical Research Centre Kilifi, Kenya; National Institute of Medical Research, Ifakara Centre, Tanzania; Nigeria Institute of Medical Research. <BR/>We searched conference proceedings and symposia manually for reports of trials and contacted major pharmaceutical companies that formulate diazepam such as Roche.<BR/>The reviewers consulted existing reviews on the topic, and identified relevant citations.<BR/>The review protocol panel, internal and external editors, checked the completeness of the search strategy.</P>

<BR/>CO scanned the results of the search strategy, and retrieved full articles for potentially relevant trials. Two reviewers, CO and AL, independently applied the inclusion criteria using the eligibility form based on the contents of the section "criteria for inclusion".

<B>Assessment of methodological quality</B>
</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<BR/>We independently assessed studies that met the inclusion criteria for their methodological quality in relation to generation of allocation sequence, allocation concealment, blinding and loss to follow up. For each selected trial, each quality component excluding blinding was categorized as 'adequate', 'inadequate' or 'unclear' according to Juni et al (<LINK REF="REF-Juni-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Juni 2001</LINK>). For loss to follow up, inclusion of 90% of participants was considered adequate. We assigned each trial a score for concealment of allocation of either A (low risk of bias), B (moderate risk of bias), or C (high risk of bias) as contained in the Cochrane Reviewers' Handbook (<LINK REF="REF-Clarke-2003b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clarke 2003b</LINK>). Blinding of the intervention to caregivers and blinding of outcome ascertainment were noted. We assessed blinding as open (all parties were aware of treatment), single (the participant or care provider/assessor was aware of the treatment given), or double (trial used a placebo or a double-dummy technique such that neither the participant or care provider/assessor knew which treatment was given) blind. We were aware that blinding may not have been attempted in trials where different routes of administration were used. We resolved any disagreements through discussion or by consulting a third party. Where information was classed as 'unclear' we attempted to contact the authors. This information was displayed in an additional table and described in the section "Methodological Quality of Included Studies". Following inclusion of all eligible studies, we aimed to conduct sensitivity analysis for each of the quality factors using the above subgroups. </P>

<LI>
<B>Data extraction</B>
</LI>
</UL>
<P>CO and AL independently applied a piloted data extraction form to extract data from selected trials on study characteristics including methods, participants, interventions, and outcomes. Any disagreements between the reviewers was resolved by discussion. Where data from the trial report were either inadequate or missing, we attempted to contact the authors for additional information. Where applicable, we extracted data to allow an intention-to-treat analysis. If the numbers randomized and the numbers analyzed were inconsistent, the percentage loss-to-follow-up was to be calculated and this information reported in an additional table. For binary outcomes we recorded the number of participants experiencing the event in each group of the trial. For continuous outcomes for each group, we extracted the arithmetic means and standard deviations. For data reported using geometric means, standard deviations were to be extracted on the log scale. If provided in the trial, medians and ranges were extracted and reported in tables.</P>
<UL>
<LI>
<B>Data analysis</B>
</LI>
</UL>
<P>CO and AL analyzed the data using Review Manager (Version 4.2). Outcome measures for binary data were compared using the relative risk (RR) and its 95% confidence interval; for continuous data, the weighted mean difference (WMD) and its 95% confidence interval. Where continuous data had been reported using geometric means, the findings were to be combined on a log scale and reported on the original scale. Medians and ranges were to be reported in tables only. <BR/>Subgroup analyses were to be carried out to determine the role of age, pattern of tetanus (localized or generalized), severity at study entry, and route of administration on the effects of diazepam.<BR/>For meta-analyses, we used a fixed effect model. </P>
<P>Additional comparisons and analyses were added post facto because the two eligible studies included these groups. These were:<BR/>1) Diazepam alone versus phenobarbitone and chlorpromazine and diazepam<BR/>2) Diazepam alone versus phenobarbitone and chlorpromazine with or without diazepam </P>

<P>The trials studied a total of 134 participants comprising hospitalized neonates and older children with tetanus. <LINK REF="STD-Hendrickse-1965" TYPE="STUDY">Hendrickse 1965</LINK> studied 26 (19 neonates, seven post-neonatal) Nigerian children aged between one month and 10 years of age, while <LINK REF="STD-Tjoen-1970" TYPE="STUDY">Tjoen 1970</LINK> studied 108 (74 neonates, 34 post-neonatal) Indonesian children aged between three days and 12 years. Adults were excluded in both studies. <LINK REF="STD-Hendrickse-1965" TYPE="STUDY">Hendrickse 1965</LINK> did not pre-specify the severity of tetanus at study entry, while <LINK REF="STD-Tjoen-1970" TYPE="STUDY">Tjoen 1970</LINK> categorized severity of tetanus at recruitment as severe, moderate and mild. </P>

<P>The two eligible studies allocated the participants to three similar groups<BR/>1) Diazepam alone (experimental intervention )<BR/>2) Phenobarbitone and chlorpromazine (control intervention A)<BR/>3) Phenobarbitone, chlorpromazine and diazepam (control intervention B)</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Hendrickse-1965" TYPE="STUDY">Hendrickse 1965</LINK>, a total of eight children (five neonates, three older children) were randomly allocated to diazepam alone group, while nine children each (seven neonates, two older children) were allocated the control groups A and B respectively.<BR/>In <LINK REF="STD-Tjoen-1970" TYPE="STUDY">Tjoen 1970</LINK>, 33 children excluding neonates were allocated to the diazepam alone group, while 38 and 37 children were allocated to control groups A and B respectively. The reason for excluding all neonates from the experimental intervention was described as due to 'bad experience' with diazepam in the older children. The numbers of neonates allocated to control groups A and B were not stated.<BR/> <BR/>The experimental and control drugs were administered by the oral route in both trials. Overall, the doses of both the experimental and control interventions were higher in <LINK REF="STD-Tjoen-1970" TYPE="STUDY">Tjoen 1970</LINK>, compared to <LINK REF="STD-Hendrickse-1965" TYPE="STUDY">Hendrickse 1965</LINK>. As much as 4-9 mg/kg diazepam was used in <LINK REF="STD-Tjoen-1970" TYPE="STUDY">Tjoen 1970</LINK> compared with 0.44 to 1.1mg/kg in <LINK REF="STD-Hendrickse-1965" TYPE="STUDY">Hendrickse 1965</LINK>.</P>
<P>Participants in both studies received other standard treatments for tetanus, which included intramuscular phenobarbitone and chlorpromazine given on admission to all the participants in <LINK REF="STD-Tjoen-1970" TYPE="STUDY">Tjoen 1970</LINK>, to control spasms and convulsions. Intramuscular paraldehyde was used for the same purpose in <LINK REF="STD-Hendrickse-1965" TYPE="STUDY">Hendrickse 1965</LINK>.

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>This review aimed to determine from reliable research the efficacy and safety of diazepam compared to other treatment options used in tetanus. The two included studies were small and the logistics of randomization, in particular generation of allocation sequence and concealment of allocation, were not clear. Blinding of intervention to the caregivers or to the investigators and outcome assessors was not stated. These methodological issues potentially increased the risk of bias, and cast doubt on the internal validity of the trial results. However, while we recognize the difficulties earlier trialists in medical research may have faced in general, it is noteworthy that there are no recent trials of adequate methodological quality based on the eligibility criteria for inclusion, particularly from regions that bear the burden of tetanus. Furthermore, the inclusion of diazepam in one of the two control groups in each of the two included trials "contaminated" those control groups, so that any true effect of diazepam on death and other outcomes may have been diluted by this experimental design. </P>
<P>Noteworthy concerns in this review include the comparability of the study groups that included largely neonates and fewer older children and adults, the bioavailability of oral medications in sick neonates, and the huge difference in the dose of diazepam used in the two studies, which varied by as much as nine fold. Rather than any differences in biological constitution, pathogenesis and pathophysiology of tetanus between neonates, older children and adults, it is the low passive immunity due to inadequate maternal immunization, unhygienic cord care practices, and principal portal of entry by the umbilicus that are the major risk factors unique to neonates. These factors account for their greater predisposition to tetanus compared with other groups. Nevertheless, the effect of a predominantly neonatal age group in the trials may be more evident and possibly change the findings once we diaggregate the two groups, but doing this may further dilute and weaken the power of the studies and findings. Doubts about the bioavailability of medications administered orally in sick neonates will be justified where the sickness involves and/or affects the gastrointestinal tract, in which case there will be clinical pointers supporting same such as abdominal distension, vomiting and/or diarrhoea. In such situations, absorption of gastrointestinal contents including medications may be impaired. Usually, unless tetanus is complicated by septicaemia with gastrointestinal involvement, medications and feeds are usually given via nasogastric tube in the settings where the disease burden is high. </P>
<P>Although there is a consistent beneficial effect in both <LINK REF="STD-Hendrickse-1965" TYPE="STUDY">Hendrickse 1965</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Tjoen-1970" TYPE="STUDY">Tjoen 1970</LINK> suggesting that diazepam given alone that diazepam alone is more efficacious in treating tetanus compared with other conventional treatment, and that combination therapy may be harmful, this observation is methodologically and statistically limited, and insufficient to support or justify a change in current practice. Also, there were no data on safety of the interventions used in both trials.</P>
<P>Giving diazepam alone or supplementing conventional anticonvulsants (phenobarbitone and chlorpromazine) with diazepam, was reported to be associated with statistically significant milder clinical course and shorter duration of hospitalization in one study. </P>
<P>
<B>Applicability:</B>
</P>
<P>
<B>Location<BR/>
</B>Data included in this review are from studies conducted in areas that still bear the burden of tetanus and these include Nigeria in sub-Saharan Africa and Indonesia in South East Asia. These resource poor countries still grapple with the burden of tetanus, cannot afford treatments requiring total paralysis and ventilation support as is the case in developed countries, and therefore still depend on the interventions under review. They have the greatest need for evidence of effects of drugs used in treating tetanus. </P>
<P>
<B>Populations<BR/>
</B>The two trials enrolled neonates (who are the most affected by tetanus) as well as post-neonatal children, but not adults. However, the studies failed to stratify randomisation or report outcome data according to age; but we recognize that the smallness of sample size in the trials, particularly in <LINK REF="STD-Hendrickse-1965" TYPE="STUDY">Hendrickse 1965</LINK>, could have precluded stratification into subgroups. </P>
<P>
<B>Benefits and risks<BR/>
</B>Both trials show that diazepam alone is associated with fewer deaths and that additional drugs or combination treatment are not beneficial and may cause harm in tetanus. However, these studies are dated and are insufficient methodologically and statistically for any definite conclusion on benefits. Also, both trials did not provide data of safety of the interventions.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>Diazepam alone compared to other currently used drugs may be more effective in treating tetanus, and adding other drugs to diazepam has no benefit or may be harmful. However, available data are insufficient and too dated to permit any definite or firm deductions to support change in current practice. Furthermore, these trials were not designed with adverse events as primary outcomes and this further limits any conclusion that may influence current practice. Therefore, the application of the present beneficial effect associated with diazepam should be with caution and be moderated by local needs and circumstances pending the availability of best evidence from large randomized controlled trials. </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>This review clearly demonstrates the paucity of recent randomized trials of adequate methodological quality on the benefits and harms of major therapeutic interventions used for treating tetanus, and reinforce the need for further investigations in this area. While a large prospective multi-center trial may be warranted, it is hoped that in the light of clear evidence about the preventive efficacy of tetanus toxoid immunization, concerted efforts should be reinforced towards preventive interventions and ultimate eradication of tetanus such that there will not be enough case materials for a trial of this nature. However, in the event that a trial becomes absolutely necessary, the flaws of existing trials should be prevented in any future trial and adequate attention should be paid to randomization, blinding and the types of experimental and control interventions given. Also, future trialists should endeavour to state the study objectives and inclusion criteria explicitly; categorize participants by severity of disease; use other clinically pragmatic outcomes; record adverse events. Trial reports should conform to the CONSORT (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials) statement to permit the reader to clearly understand the trial design, conduct, analysis, interpretation and report (<LINK REF="REF-Moher-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 2003</LINK>). </P>
