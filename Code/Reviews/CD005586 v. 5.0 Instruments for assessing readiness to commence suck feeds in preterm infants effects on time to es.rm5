<P>
<B>Review question:</B> Does using an assessment tool which has been designed to assess preterm infants' readiness to commence breast or bottle feeding improve feeding outcomes and decrease length of stay?</P>
<P>
<B>Background: </B>Unlike babies born at term, who are able to breast or bottle feed soon after birth, preterm infants need time to learn to feed. This may take days or weeks after they are born. Preterm babies commence breast or bottle feeding at a time when the baby is deemed to be ready, as determined by healthcare professionals looking after the baby. The optimal timing of the introduction of suck feeds is unclear in both the literature and in practice. An individualised assessment specifically designed to assess an individual infant's readiness to commence breast or bottle feeding has been suggested as the best way to promote consistency in identifying when it is safe for an infant to commence breast or bottle feeding.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics: </B>No studies were found that met the inclusion criteria on this review.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results/Conclusion: </B>Although a limited number of assessment tools to determine feeding readiness currently exist, no studies were found that evaluated the benefit or risk to the preterm infant. As a result, it is unclear to what extent a feeding readiness tool would assist healthcare professionals to decide when to introduce breast or bottle feeding to the preterm infant.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of evidence: </B>No evidence was found.<BR/>

<P>One of the most challenging milestones for preterm infants is the acquisition of safe and efficient feeding skills. The majority of healthy full term infants are born with skills to coordinate their suck, swallow and respiration. However, this is not the case for preterm infants who develop these skills gradually as they transition from tube feeding to suck feeds. For preterm infants the ability to engage in oral feeding behaviour is dependent on many factors. The complexity of factors influencing feeding readiness has led some researchers to investigate the use of an individualised assessment of an infant's abilities. A limited number of instruments that aim to indicate an individual infant's readiness to commence either breast or bottle feeding have been developed.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2016-08-03 15:30:17 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>One of the most challenging milestones for preterm infants is the acquisition of safe and efficient feeding skills (<LINK REF="REF-Hill-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hill 2002</LINK>). The majority of healthy full-term infants are born with skills to coordinate suck, swallow and respiration that allow safe oral feeding (<LINK REF="REF-Lau-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lau 2003</LINK>). However, this is not the case for preterm infants who develop these skills gradually as they transition from tube feeding to suck feeds (<LINK REF="STD-Thoyre-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Thoyre 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dodrill-2008a" TYPE="STUDY">Dodrill 2008a</LINK>). This transition to full oral feeding is an important competency for the baby to attain prior to discharge home (<LINK REF="REF-Pickler-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pickler 2003</LINK>). Delays in discharge are often secondary to feeding difficulties, leading to increased financial costs (<LINK REF="REF-Simpson-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Simpson 2002</LINK>). Strategies to avoid delays must be the focus of care without compromising the safety of the infant (<LINK REF="STD-McGrath-2004" TYPE="STUDY">McGrath 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>Introducing suck feeds as soon as the neurologic development and physical condition of the infant permits has been reported to have several advantages including shorter transition time to all suck feeds, greater maternal satisfaction and shorter hospital stay (<LINK REF="REF-Pridham-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pridham 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Simpson-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Simpson 2002</LINK>). However, feeding infants who are unable to safely commence feeding may lead to problems with respiration, growth and nutritional status, with infants being at higher risk of 1) aspiration pneumonia, 2) readmission to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), 3) fatigue, 4) increased energy expenditure, 5) hypoxia, 6) bradycardia and 7) deglutition apnoea (<LINK REF="REF-Hill-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hill 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Breton-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Breton 2008</LINK>). Therefore, careful timing is vital to ensure that the commencement of feeding is beneficial rather than detrimental to the health of the infant (<LINK REF="STD-McGrath-2004" TYPE="STUDY">McGrath 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>Factors influencing the preterm infant's ability to feed efficiently include neurobehavioural maturation, physiologic stability, control of tone, behavioural state organisation and coordinated sucking, swallowing and breathing (<LINK REF="STD-McGrath-2004" TYPE="STUDY">McGrath 2004</LINK>). Successful coordination of feeding is also dependent on the adequate development of the structures of the upper airway including the lips, palate, jaw, tongue, pharynx, larynx and oesophagus (<LINK REF="REF-Hill-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hill 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>Differences have been shown in the ability of infants to engage in feeding behaviour at a particular gestational age through studies of preterm infant sucking (<LINK REF="REF-Nyqvist-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nyqvist 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lemons-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lemons 2001</LINK>). Although gestational age is a guide to expected maturity, disparities are evident in the rates that infants mature (<LINK REF="REF-Nyqvist-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nyqvist 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Simpson-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Simpson 2002</LINK>). Furthermore, a preterm infant's feeding ability may not always be consistent at each feed while infants are transitioning from gavage feeds (<LINK REF="STD-McGrath-2004" TYPE="STUDY">McGrath 2004</LINK>). Differences in the sucking patterns between breast and bottle feeding have also been found and may impact significantly on the infant's ability to commence suck feeds (<LINK REF="STD-Thoyre-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Thoyre 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>Studies examining current practices in neonatal nurseries have found that over 50% of nurseries have no specific policy or guideline on when to commence suck feeds with nurses predominantly using behavioural cues, gestation age and weight to determine readiness (<LINK REF="STD-Kinneer-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Kinneer 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Siddell-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Siddell 1994</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2016-08-03 15:41:59 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Several instruments to aid neonatal care providers with determining a preterm infant's readiness to commence feeding have been described. The Preterm Infant Nipple Feeding Readiness Scale (PINFRS) is a 10-item scale that scored variables such as gestational age, post-conceptual age, colour and activity, state regulation, hunger cues and tone (<LINK REF="STD-McGrath-2003" TYPE="STUDY">McGrath 2003</LINK>). However, this instrument has been renamed as the Feeding Readiness and Progression in Preterms Scale (FRAPPS) (<LINK REF="REF-McGrath-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">McGrath 2008</LINK>). The second instrument, the Early Feeding Skill (EFS) assessment tool, not only aims to assess feeding readiness but also feeding skill and feeding recovery (<LINK REF="STD-Thoyre-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Thoyre 2005</LINK>). The feeding readiness section of the EFS consists of five items that assess an infant's readiness to commence oral feeds by observing its tone, energy level, state of arousal and oxygen saturation (<LINK REF="STD-Thoyre-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Thoyre 2005</LINK>). Lastly, <LINK REF="STD-Fuginaga-2007a" TYPE="STUDY">Fuginaga 2007a</LINK> developed and tested an 18-item preterm infant oral feeding readiness instrument consisting of items in relation to corrected gestational age, behavioural state, global posture and tone, gag reflex, tongue movement and cupping, jaw movements and maintenance of an alert state. Each item is scored from 0 to 2 with a possible maximum score of 36.</P>
<P>All instruments were designed so that the infant being assessed for feeding readiness could pass or fail. These assessments aim to determine whether to attempt breast or bottle feeding and may easily be repeated prior to each feed while feeding is being established.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2016-08-03 15:43:26 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The use of a formal screening instrument that encompasses an individual infant's behaviour and development has been suggested as a way to improve the accuracy of determining when the infant is ready to commence feeding (<LINK REF="STD-McGrath-2003" TYPE="STUDY">McGrath 2003</LINK>). It is thought that many preterm babies may be ready to breast or bottle feed; however, as this readiness is often not identified they continue to be fed via a tube for longer than necessary.  Alternatively, some babies who are slower at developing these skills may be introduced to breast or bottle feeding too soon. It is hypothesised that by identifying their readiness, neonatal care providers could ensure that infants have more successful feeding attempts and reduce the time taken to achieve all suck feeds and the possibility of adverse events. The use of a formalised instrument could also standardise measurement of feeding readiness and facilitate the documentation of feeding attempts.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2011-10-30 14:43:27 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="Linda Crowe">
<P>The possible benefits of a screening instrument to assess feeding readiness must be weighed against the additional staff time required and other costs and possible detrimental effects such as introducing oral feeds when infants are not ready or withholding oral feeding. This review addresses the balance of benefits and risks of screening instruments for commencement of suck feeds in preterm infants in order to assist in establishing an evidence base for clinical decision-making.</P>

<P>1. The experimental group involved infants who had been deemed ready on general clinical grounds and who were then assessed for readiness to commence oral feeding through the use of an instrument prior to the initiation of the first breast or bottle feed. The instrument had to include assessment of one or more of the following:<BR/>a) motor development and abilities including posture, movement, tone, reflexes;<BR/>b) behaviour state and cues including state of arousal and presence of feeding behaviour cues;<BR/>c) physiological parameters;<BR/>d) integrity of oral structures.</P>
<P>2. The control group involved infants who were not assessed by any formal instrument as feeding was commenced once readiness was determined on general clinical grounds.</P>
<P>3. A comparison group involved infants who had been deemed ready on general clinical grounds and who were then assessed for readiness to feed by an alternate feeding assessment instrument.</P>
<P>'General clinical grounds' was defined as a clinical impression, which may have included gestational age, medical stability or infant cues, but excluded the use of a formal assessment instrument. Instruments must have undergone psychometric evaluation including tests for criterion-related or construct validity. In groups where an instrument was used, infants had to pass prior to commencement of feeding. Physiological parameters included heart rate, respiration rate and oxygen saturation levels. Other physiological parameters used by individual trials were acceptable provided they were defined in the trial protocol.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Quality of evidence</HEADING>

<P>Two authors planned to independently assess the quality of the evidence for each of the outcomes above. We planned to consider evidence from randomised controlled trials as high quality but downgrade the evidence one level for serious (or two levels for very serious) limitations based upon the following: design (risk of bias); consistency across studies; directness of the evidence; precision of estimates; and presence of publication bias. We planned to use the <LINK REF="REF-GRADEpro-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">GRADEpro 2008</LINK> Guideline Development Tool to create a &#8216;Summary of findings&#8217; table to report the quality of the evidence.</P>
<P>The GRADE approach results in an assessment of the quality of a body of evidence in one of four grades:</P>
<OL>
<LI>High: We are very confident that the true effect lies close to that of the estimate of the effect.</LI>
<LI>Moderate: We are moderately confident in the effect estimate: the true effect is likely to be close to the estimate of the effect, but there is a possibility that it is substantially different.</LI>
<LI>Low: Our confidence in the effect estimate is limited: the true effect may be substantially different from the estimate of the effect.</LI>

Two review authors reviewed the titles and abstracts of all 716 publications. Only 44 articles were retrieved in the full-text format for further consideration. However, no studies were found that met the inclusion criteria for this review.</P>
<P>Within the 44 excluded articles, nine articles were found not to be research but a review of the literature. These nine articles were retrieved in the full-text format in order to search the reference lists to ensure no studies were missed during the electronic searching of databases. Topics of the literature review articles included initiation of, and transition to, suck feeds (<LINK REF="STD-Lemons-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Lemons 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ross-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Ross 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Thoyre-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Thoyre 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McGrath-2004" TYPE="STUDY">McGrath 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Frischknecht-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Frischknecht 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fern_x00e1_ndez-D_x00ed_az-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Fernández Díaz 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lau-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Lau 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Breton-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Breton 2008</LINK>) as well as the diagnostic tools used to determine feeding readiness (<LINK REF="STD-da-Costa-2008" TYPE="STUDY">da Costa 2008</LINK>).</P>

<P>Although there were two randomised trials that evaluated the clinical utility of the implementation of a feeding protocol found in the search (<LINK REF="STD-McCain-2001" TYPE="STUDY">McCain 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McCain-2002" TYPE="STUDY">McCain 2002</LINK>), these studies did not compare assessment of feeding readiness with no assessment but rather compared no non-nutritive sucking with the use of 10 minutes of non-nutritive sucking prior to assessing behavioural state as an indicator of feeding readiness. There were also two studies that used historical controls to evaluate their implementation into practice (<LINK REF="STD-Kirk-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Kirk 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Drenckpohl-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Drenckpohl 2009</LINK>). Other articles related to methods to determine feeding initiation or transition were either a description of the method (<LINK REF="STD-Premji-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Premji 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McCain-2003" TYPE="STUDY">McCain 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Premji-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Premji 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pickler-2005a" TYPE="STUDY">Pickler 2005a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Thoyre-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Thoyre 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ludwig-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Ludwig 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shaker-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Shaker 2007</LINK>) or psychometric testing of an instrument (<LINK REF="STD-McGrath-2003" TYPE="STUDY">McGrath 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fuginaga-2007a" TYPE="STUDY">Fuginaga 2007a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fujinaga-2007b" TYPE="STUDY">Fujinaga 2007b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Neiva-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Neiva 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rossarolla-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Rossarolla 2009</LINK>). Psychometric testing of the instruments did not involve an experimental design but rather other non-experimental designs such as observational studies and expert panels.</P>
<P>A further three observational studies were found that described the psychometric testing of instruments that either did not measure or indirectly measured the construct of feeding readiness. The Dynamic-Early Feeding Scale (D-EFS) is an observational coding scheme to continuously code videotaped oral feeding (<LINK REF="STD-Thoyre-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Thoyre 2009</LINK>). This instrument should not be confused with another instrument developed by the authors, the Early Feeding Skills (EFS) (<LINK REF="STD-Thoyre-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Thoyre 2005</LINK>), which is described in the background of this review and contains a checklist of five questions to determine feeding readiness. The other two observational studies used an existing instrument, the Neonatal Oral Motor Assessment Scale (NOMAS) that measures infants' nutritive sucking behaviours. These studies investigated the NOMAS psychometric characteristics within a healthy preterm population (<LINK REF="STD-Howe-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Howe 2007</LINK>) and as an indicator of feeding readiness (<LINK REF="STD-Church-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Church 2006</LINK>). Non-nutritive sucking (NNS) instruments have also been utilised during the commencement and early suck feeding period to assist clinicians in determining feeding readiness in the preterm infants.</P>
<P>Other studies were found that contributed to the knowledge of feeding readiness and progression but did not involve assessment of feeding readiness. Staff surveys were used to document how staff decide to commence breast or bottle feeding (<LINK REF="STD-Kinneer-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Kinneer 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Siddell-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Siddell 1994</LINK>) as well as manage the transition period from tube feeding to all breast or bottle feeds (<LINK REF="STD-Dodrill-2008b" TYPE="STUDY">Dodrill 2008b</LINK>). Current management of feeding initiation and progression has also been investigated using chart audits (<LINK REF="STD-Flint-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Flint 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dodrill-2008a" TYPE="STUDY">Dodrill 2008a</LINK>). Observational studies were utilised to explore factors that may relate to feeding readiness (<LINK REF="STD-Cagan-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Cagan 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McGrath-2002" TYPE="STUDY">McGrath 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-B_x00fc_hler-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Bühler 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McGrath-2005" TYPE="STUDY">McGrath 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pickler-2005b" TYPE="STUDY">Pickler 2005b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bauer-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Bauer 2008</LINK>) as well as interventions that may enhance preterm infants' ability to engage in feeding behaviour (<LINK REF="STD-White_x002d_Traut-2002" TYPE="STUDY">White-Traut 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-White_x002d_Traut-2005" TYPE="STUDY">White-Traut 2005</LINK>). The effects of feeding experience, maturity and morbidity on feeding milestones (<LINK REF="STD-Pickler-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Pickler 2009</LINK>) as well sucking patterns (<LINK REF="STD-Cunha-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Cunha 2009</LINK>) were also studied.</P>
<P>In the 2016 update, a further 918 records were found (See <LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>). Out of these 918 records , 474 records were identified from database searching while 444 records were found through searching clinical trial registries. This was reduced to 903 when duplicates were removed. A total of 13 records were retrieved in full text but all were excluded (<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_EXCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of excluded studies</LINK>).

<P>Of the experimental studies that were found the majority were investigating an intervention to assist the preterm infant to commence or transition to all suck feeds.

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2016-08-03 16:48:51 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The absence of randomised or quasi-randomised studies evaluating the use of a formalised instrument to assess a preterm infant's readiness has resulted in this systematic review being unable to determine the effects of using such an instrument on the time to establish full oral feeding or duration of hospitalisations.</P>
<P>The excluded studies of the 2012 review showed that there is an interest among researchers in how to best approach the dilemma of when to commence breast or bottle feeds. This review focused on validated instruments but there were a number of other methods found (for example care pathways, protocols, clinical guidelines) that could potentially aide clinicians in managing suck feeding initiation and progression. There were a few studies that demonstrated that the application of a feeding protocol may improve outcomes including the time taken to all suck feeds (<LINK REF="STD-McCain-2001" TYPE="STUDY">McCain 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kirk-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Kirk 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Drenckpohl-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Drenckpohl 2009</LINK>) and length of hospital stay (<LINK REF="STD-McCain-2001" TYPE="STUDY">McCain 2001</LINK>). The benefit of using a formalised instrument over other methods such as clinical judgement or a criterion such as gestational age is that an instrument ensures that a systematic and consistent method of assessing feeding readiness is utilised. We identified a number of instruments that specifically assessed feeding readiness; however the clinical utility of these instruments was not investigated in an experimental study. The studies were observational with their focus on establishing the validity and reliability of the tool (<LINK REF="STD-McGrath-2003" TYPE="STUDY">McGrath 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fuginaga-2007a" TYPE="STUDY">Fuginaga 2007a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fujinaga-2007b" TYPE="STUDY">Fujinaga 2007b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Neiva-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Neiva 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rossarolla-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Rossarolla 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>Since the original search there has been continued research and development into methods to assess and support preterm infants in their transition to full suck feeds. Although no further instruments were discovered by this update, a number of the instruments or methods to assess feeding readiness cited in the 2012 review have been further developed. Both the NNS scoring system (<LINK REF="STD-Neiva-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Neiva 2014</LINK>) and the Preterm Oral Feeding Readiness Scale (<LINK REF="REF-Fujinaga-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fujinaga 2013</LINK>) have undergone further testing by their respective authors to determine cut-off scores of when to initiate or withhold suck feeds. Furthermore, a cross-cultural validation study has been undertaken to translate the Preterm Oral Feeding Readiness Scale from English into Italian (<LINK REF="REF-Orsenigo-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Orsenigo 2016</LINK>). Building upon their earlier work, Waitzman and Ludwig have also recently published an article describing a Delphi survey that has contributed to establishing content validity of their Infant-Driven Feeding Scales (<LINK REF="REF-Waitzman-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Waitzman 2014</LINK>).</P>
<P>Feeding readiness instruments are also starting to be utilised by other research teams in observational studies or chart audits (pre- and post-implementation) to demonstrate the clinical benefit of using a standardised assessment tool or protocol (<LINK REF="REF-Gelfer-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gelfer 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wellington-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wellington 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bolzan-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bolzan 2016</LINK>).</P>
<P>The lack of any experimental studies to establish the clinical utility of the instruments may simply be that they are too newly developed to have undergone such testing. The absence of randomised or quasi-randomised trials may also be a reflection of the practical difficulties in ensuring that the comparison group is not exposed to the intervention, particularly in the situation where the use of an instrument is compared to normal clinical practice with direct caregivers collecting data.</P>

<P>References were added to the background where appropriate, including the addition of a reference related to a tool developed by Fujingaga as well as a reference to the name change of the Preterm Infant Nipple Feeding Readiness tool.</P>
<P>The search strategy was also altered. The databases Oxford Database of Perinatal Trials and Pre-CINAHL were not searched. The original search terms in the protocol were also changed to fit with each database. See Appendices for full details of the search strategy used for each database (<LINK REF="APP-01" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 1</LINK>; <LINK REF="APP-02" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 2</LINK>).</P>
<P>Changes to the wording of the text were made in the methods section of the review. A more comprehensive description of the assessment of risk of bias has been provided in the review. References to RevMan 4.2 software have been replaced by RevMan 5.</P>
<P>We added the methodology and plan for 'Summary of findings' tables and GRADE recommendations, which were not included in the original protocol.</P>

<P>The following issues were to have been evaluated and entered into the 'Risk of bias' table:<BR/>1.Sequence generation (checking for possible selection bias). Was the allocation sequence adequately generated?<BR/>
<BR/>For each included study, we categorised the method used to generate the allocation sequence as:<BR/>a.low risk (any truly random process e.g. random number table; computer random number generator);<BR/>b.high risk (any non-random process e.g. odd or even date of birth; hospital or clinic record number);<BR/>c.unclear risk.<BR/>
<BR/>2.Allocation concealment (checking for possible selection bias). Was allocation adequately concealed?<BR/>
<BR/>For each included study, we categorised the method used to conceal the allocation sequence as:<BR/>a.low risk (e.g. telephone or central randomisation; consecutively numbered sealed opaque envelopes);<BR/>b.high risk (open random allocation; unsealed or non-opaque envelopes, alternation; date of birth);<BR/>c.unclear risk.<BR/>
<BR/>3.Blinding (checking for possible performance bias). Was knowledge of the allocated intervention adequately prevented during the study? At study entry? At the time of outcome assessment?<BR/>
<BR/>For each included study, we categorised the methods used to blind study participants and personnel from knowledge of which intervention a participant received. Blinding was assessed separately for different outcomes or classes of outcomes. We categorised the methods as:<BR/>a.low risk, high risk or unclear risk for participants;<BR/>b.low risk, high risk or unclear risk for personnel;<BR/>c.low risk, high risk or unclear risk for outcome assessors.<BR/>
<BR/>4.Incomplete outcome data (checking for possible attrition bias through withdrawals, dropouts, protocol deviations). Were incomplete outcome data adequately addressed?<BR/>
<BR/>For each included study and for each outcome, we described the completeness of data including attrition and exclusions from the analysis. We noted whether attrition and exclusions were reported, the numbers included in the analysis at each stage (compared with the total randomised participants), reasons for attrition or exclusion where reported, and whether missing data were balanced across groups or were related to outcomes. Where sufficient information was reported or supplied by the trial authors, we re-included missing data in the analyses. We categorised the methods as:<BR/>a.low risk (&lt; 20% missing data);<BR/>b.high risk (&#8805; 20% missing data);<BR/>c.unclear risk.<BR/>
<BR/>5.Selective reporting bias. Are reports of the study free of suggestion of selective outcome reporting?<BR/>
<BR/>For each included study, we described how we investigated the possibility of selective outcome reporting bias and what we found. We assessed the methods as:<BR/>a.low risk (where it is clear that all of the study&#8217;s pre-specified outcomes and all expected outcomes of interest to the review have been reported);<BR/>b.high risk (where not all the study&#8217;s pre-specified outcomes have been reported; one or more reported primary outcomes were not pre-specified outcomes of interest or are reported incompletely and so cannot be used; study fails to include results of a key outcome that would have been expected to have been reported);<BR/>c.unclear risk.<BR/>
<BR/>6.Other sources of bias. Was the study apparently free of other problems that could put it at a high risk of bias?<BR/>
<BR/>For each included study, we described any important concerns we had about other possible sources of bias (for example, whether there was a potential source of bias related to the specific study design or whether the trial was stopped early due to some data-dependent process). We assessed whether each study was free of other problems that could put it at risk of bias as:<BR/>a.low risk;<BR/>b.high risk;<BR/>c.unclear risk.<BR/>If needed, we planned to explore the impact of the level of bias through undertaking sensitivity analyses.<BR/>
