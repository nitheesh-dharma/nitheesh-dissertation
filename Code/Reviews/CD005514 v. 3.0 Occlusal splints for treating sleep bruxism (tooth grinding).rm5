<P>There is insufficient evidence to either support or refute the use of occlusal splints for treating patients with tooth grinding or clenching during sleep (sleep bruxism).<BR/>Sleep bruxism is characterised by several signs and symptoms. Among them abnormal tooth wear, fractured teeth, joint pain or tenderness, jaw muscle discomfort, and headaches. Treatments include odontological devices such as occlusal splints, pharmacotherapy, and psychotherapy. An occlusal splint is a removable appliance worn in the upper jaw (maxilla) or the lower jaw (mandible), with coverage of the dental surfaces. They are usually used to prevent tooth wear.<BR/>There is not enough evidence in the literature to show that occlusal splints can reduce sleep bruxism.</P>
</SUMMARY_BODY>
</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Sleep bruxism is an oral activity characterised by teeth grinding or clenching during sleep. Several treatments for sleep bruxism have been proposed such as pharmacological, psychological, and dental.<BR/> </P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To evaluate the effectiveness of occlusal splints for the treatment of sleep bruxism with alternative interventions, placebo or no treatment.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>We searched the Cochrane Oral Health Group's Trials Register (to May 2007); the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (<I>The Cochrane Library</I> 2007, Issue 1); MEDLINE (1966 to May 2007); EMBASE (1980 to May 2007); LILACS (1982 to May 2007); Biblioteca Brasileira de Odontologia (1982 to May 2007); Dissertation, Theses and Abstracts (1981 to May 2007); and handsearched abstracts of particular importance to this review. Additional reports were identified from the reference lists of retrieved reports and from article reviews about treating sleep bruxism. There were no language restrictions.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>We selected randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials (RCTs), in which splint therapy was compared concurrently to no treatment, other occlusal appliances, or any other intervention in participants with sleep bruxism.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Data extraction was carried out independently and in duplicate. Validity assessment of the included trials was carried out at the same time as data extraction. Discrepancies were discussed and a third review author consulted. The author of the primary study was contacted when necessary. </P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Thirty-two potentially relevant RCTs were identified. Twenty-four trials were excluded. Five RCTs were included. Occlusal splint was compared to: palatal splint, mandibular advancement device, transcutaneous electric nerve stimulation, and no treatment. There was just one common outcome (arousal index) which was combined in a meta-analysis. No statistically significant differences between the occlusal splint and control groups were found in the meta-analyses. </P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>There is not sufficient evidence to state that the occlusal splint is effective for treating sleep bruxism. Indication of its use is questionable with regard to sleep outcomes, but it may be that there is some benefit with regard to tooth wear. This systematic review suggests the need for further investigation in more controlled RCTs that pay attention to method of allocation, outcome assessment, large sample size, and sufficient duration of follow up. The study design must be parallel, in order to eliminate the bias provided by studies of cross-over type. A standardisation of the outcomes of the treatment of sleep bruxism should be established in the RCTs.</P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
</ABSTRACT>
<BODY MODIFIED="2008-07-30 18:40:32 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND>
<P>According to the International Classification of Sleep Disorders (ICSD-2) (<LINK REF="REF-AASM-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">AASM 2005</LINK>), sleep related bruxism is an oral activity characterised by teeth grinding or clenching during sleep, it is usually associated with sleep arousals, and it is usually accompanied by sounds (<LINK REF="REF-Bader-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bader 2000</LINK>). Sleep bruxism is characterised by several signs and symptoms. Among the signs are abnormal tooth wear, fractured teeth, tongue indentation, polygraphic observation of jaw muscle activity with audible teeth grinding sounds, masseter muscle hypertrophy, facial pain, temporomandibular joint tenderness or pain on digital palpation, reduction in salivary flow, lip or cheek biting, and burning tongue with concomitant oral habits. Symptoms include teeth grinding sounds during sleep recounted by individual's bed partner, jaw muscle discomfort with or without pain, headache, teeth hypersensitivity, stress and anxiety (<LINK REF="REF-AASM-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">AASM 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Okeson-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Okeson 1996</LINK>). Severe sleep related bruxism may also result in sleep disruption which has implications not only to the patient, but also to the bed partner, because sounds caused by the teeth friction are usually quite loud, disturbing and are perceived as being unpleasant. <BR/>
<BR/>Bruxism has been classified into: primary (idiopatic) or secondary (iatrogenic). Primary bruxism includes clenching and sleep bruxism and is not related to any medical condition, while secondary bruxism is associated with medical conditions (e.g. neurologic, psychiatric, sleep disorders medication) that may exaggerate primary bruxism (<LINK REF="REF-Lavigne-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lavigne 2000</LINK>). Bruxism can occur when awake, a semi-voluntary clenching activity of the jaw rarely associated with sounds. The presentation during sleep is significantly different from that during wakefulness, because sleep bruxism is usually associated with sleep arousals. </P>
<P>Sleep bruxism starts at 1 year of age, soon after the eruption of the deciduous incisors. Its prevalence in children ranges from 14% to 20% (<LINK REF="REF-Abe-1966" TYPE="REFERENCE">Abe 1966</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Widmalm-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Widmalm 1995</LINK>). <BR/>Frequently it appears in adolescence (<LINK REF="REF-Partinen-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Partinen 1994</LINK>), with a prevalence of 13% in 18- to 29-year olds. The prevalence in adults is 8% considering the occurrence of teeth grinding during sleep at least weekly, decreasing with age, up to 3% in individuals over 60 years (<LINK REF="REF-Lavigne-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lavigne 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ohayon-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ohayon 2001</LINK>). There are no reported gender differences for sleep related bruxism (<LINK REF="REF-Glaros-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glaros 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lavigne-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lavigne 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Melis-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Melis 2003</LINK>). No genetic markers have been found for the transmission of this condition. However, 21% to 50% of patients who grind their teeth whilst asleep have a direct family member who ground his or her teeth in childhood (<LINK REF="REF-Abe-1966" TYPE="REFERENCE">Abe 1966</LINK>).<BR/>
<BR/>Currently the central regulation has been the focus of study in bruxism (<LINK REF="REF-Lobbezoo-2001-a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lobbezoo 2001 a</LINK>). Several risk factors have been linked to sleep bruxism such as tobacco, drugs, alcohol, psychiatric disorders, sleep disorders, anxiety, stress (<LINK REF="REF-Ohayon-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ohayon 2001</LINK>), orofacial pain, joint sound or lock at the temporomandibular.<BR/>
<BR/>Polysomnography is useful in the differential diagnosis of sleep bruxism, along with other disturbances: obstructive sleep apnoea, periodic leg movements, rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behaviour disorder (RBD), etc. (<LINK REF="REF-Lavigne-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lavigne 2000</LINK>). A diagnosis of sleep related bruxism is given in the presence of at least four episodes per hour of sleep or 25 individual muscle bursts per hour of sleep and a minimum of two audible tooth-grinding episodes per sleep recording session in the absence of associated abnormal electroencephalogram (EEG) activity (<LINK REF="REF-Lavigne-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lavigne 1996</LINK>). Polysomnographic recordings must include additional electromyogram (EMG) derivations, surface electrodes placed over bilateral masseters, temporal muscles, sometimes frontal muscles, and audio-video recordings in order to confirm the nature of the sounds (e.g. grinding, snoring) and type of movements (e.g. swallowing, myoclonus, body rocking) (<LINK REF="REF-Lavigne-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lavigne 1996</LINK>). Polysomnography may be recommended to confirm the disorder or to rule out associated respiratory disturbance, RBD, night terrors, facio-mandibular, myoclonus, or epilepsy. The sensitivity of polysomnographic study in detecting severe cases of sleep related bruxism is moderate to high.<BR/>
<BR/>Many lines of treatment for sleep related bruxism have been proposed such as pharmacological, psychological, and dental. Pharmacological treatments include various drugs such as benzodiazepines, anticonvulsants, beta blockers, dopamine agents, antidepressants, muscular relaxants, and others. Patients with severe bruxism have been administered local injections of botulinum toxin (BTX type A) for the elimination of symptoms (<LINK REF="REF-Tan-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tan 2000</LINK>). However, little is known about its effectiveness, pharmacological safety, and the follow up of the drug for a long period of time (<LINK REF="REF-Lavigne-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lavigne 2000</LINK>). The psychological treatment is behaviour therapy based on sleep hygiene, relaxation to control stress, psychotherapy, hypnosis, and biofeedback (<LINK REF="REF-Lavigne-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lavigne 2000</LINK>). Dental treatments for bruxism include occlusion adjustment, tooth surface restoration, and orthodontic treatment. These interventions are extensive and irreversible and these are not recommended in most cases (<LINK REF="REF-Clark-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clark 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Okeson-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Okeson 1996</LINK>). Occlusal appliances such as a soft mouth guard or hard occlusal stabilization splint are reversible interventions. Soft mouth guards are usually recommended for short-term use because degradation can occur rapidly (<LINK REF="REF-Lavigne-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lavigne 2000</LINK>). Occlusal splints may reduce teeth grinding, muscular activities, and myofascial pains (<LINK REF="STD-Dube-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Dube 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Raphael-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Raphael 2003</LINK>). Conversely, others have found an increase in muscle activity in 20% of hard splint users and in 50% of soft splint users (Okeson 1987). The cases presented in the literature seem to indicate a need to evaluate the use of occlusal splints for the treatment of sleep bruxism with alternative interventions. </P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Quality assessment</HEADING>
<P>The methodological quality of included studies was assessed using the following criteria, described in the <I>Cochrane Handbook of Systematic Reviews of Interventions </I>4.2.6<I>.</I>
<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Randomisation: graded as adequate (A), unclear (B), inadequate (C). Adequate (A) included any one of the following methods of randomisation: computer generated or table of random numbers, drawing of lots, coin-toss, shuffling cards or throw of a dice. Inadequate method of randomisation (C) utilising any of the following: case record number, date of birth or alternate numbers were judged as inadequate (quasi-randomised studies).</LI>
<LI>Concealment of allocation: graded as adequate (A), unclear (B), or inadequate (C). Adequate (A) methods of allocation concealment would include either central randomisation or sequentially numbered sealed opaque envelopes. This criterion was considered inadequate (C) if there was an open allocation sequence and the participants and trialists could foresee the upcoming assignment.</LI>
<LI>Blinding of outcomes assessment: whether persons assessing the outcome of care were aware of which treatment the participant received, was graded as yes, no or unclear (detection bias).</LI>
<LI>Handling of withdrawals and losses - was there a clear description given of the difference between the two groups of losses to follow up which was graded as yes (A), unclear (B) or no (C) (attrition bias).</LI>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Data analysis</HEADING>
<P>For dichotomous outcomes, the estimate of effect of an intervention was expressed as risk ratios together with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). For continuous outcomes, mean differences (WMD) to compare groups and standard deviations were used to summarise the data for each group. The random-effects model was used.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Data synthesis</HEADING>
<P>Clinical heterogeneity was assessed by examining the types of participants, interventions and outcomes in each study. Meta-analysis was used when studies were of similar comparisons reporting comparable outcome measures in similar participants. Mean differences were combined for continuous data. Risk ratios were used for dichotomous data if meta-analysis was feasible. The significance of any discrepancies in the estimates of the treatment effects from the different trials was assessed by means of Cochran's test for heterogeneity. Inconsistency among the pooled estimates was quantified using the I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic.</P>
<P>Sensitivity analyses were undertaken to examine the effect of randomisation, allocation concealment and blind outcome assessment on the overall estimates of effect.<BR/>If there were an adequate number of studies, quasi-randomised studies would be analysed separately from the randomised ones in a sensitivity analysis.</P>
<P>In a attempt to assess publication bias, data would be plotted onto a funnel plot graph (trial effect versus trial size).</P>

Occlusal splint therapy consisted of a device with full coverage of the occlusal surfaces worn in the maxilla ( <LINK REF="STD-Dube-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Dube 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hachmann-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Hachmann 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Landry-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Landry 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Van-der-Zaag-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Van der Zaag 2005</LINK>), or in the mandible (<LINK REF="STD-Alvarez_x002d_Arenal-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Alvarez-Arenal 2002</LINK>).

The mandibular advancement device which was designed to manage sleep apnoea, was used in three configurations: double arch device free without pin between arches, which allowed freedom of movement; mandibular advancement device in 25%; and 75% lower arch advancement position (<LINK REF="STD-Landry-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Landry 2006</LINK>). TENS was a low-frequency neurostimulator that generates stimuli (1 every 1.5 seconds) with a duration of 500 ms and a variable amplitude of 0 to 25mA.

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2008-07-30 18:40:32 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The objective of the present study was to evaluate the effectiveness of occlusal splints in the treatment of sleep bruxism, by means of a systematic review.</P>
<P>Among the studies identified in the databases, only five clinical trials satisfied the inclusion criteria and were thus selected. Non-randomised clinical trials and case series that did not satisfy the inclusion criteria for the present review were also found. The small number of clinical trials that fulfilled the criteria for inclusion in systematic reviews was probably due to two reasons: difficulties inherent to conducting randomised clinical trials; or lack of knowledge about the importance of conducting these types of studies in evaluating the effectiveness of a type of treatment.</P>
<P>In general, the methodological quality of the five trials included was not good. None of the studies gave a clear description of the concealment of allocation and only one study described how the allocation sequence was generated. Some inclusion criteria were not specified by the authors, and other outcomes could not be analysed because they were inappropriately described. Contact was made with the authors with the aim of clarifying possible doubts and, even after contact, only three studies were classified as A (the randomisation method was described adequately), while one study was classified as B (the randomisation method was not described) and the remaining study was classified as C (the randomisation method was described, but done inadequately). Few authors responded to the requests that were made and, unfortunately, some responses were vague and insufficient for clarifying the doubts relating to the methodological quality and the results described.</P>
<P>Most of the studies have a cross-over design. In contrast to parallel studies, each individual in a cross-over study receives two or more interventions in random order, and each patient acts as his own control. In this type of study, the washout period takes on great importance, because the treatment may alter the condition of interest in the subsequent phases, in which the patient systematically differs from the initial state (<LINK REF="REF-Elbourne-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elbourne 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>The study by <LINK REF="REF-Dub_x00e9_-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dubé 2004</LINK> was included because it was a randomised study using the chosen intervention and had the objective of determining the efficacy of the occlusal splint in comparison with a control (palatal splint) in sleep bruxism cases. However, this study presented a series of limitations, such as the fact that it was an explanatory type of study. That is, it presented a small number of participants and involved several polysomnography sessions in order to establish a baseline and the results, which is not done routinely because of the costs related to this examination. Another point is the fact that the apparatus utilised in this study (palatal splint), which was also used in the study by <LINK REF="STD-Van-der-Zaag-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Van der Zaag 2005</LINK>, differed from what is routinely used.</P>
<P>Analysis of the results from the clinical trials included in the review revealed that there were no significant differences between the group treated using an occlusal splint and those who received no treatment or were treated using a palatal splint, mandibular advancement device or transcutaneous electric nerve stimulation (TENS). The lack of significant difference between the outcomes may be due to the small number of participants included in the studies analysed. Thus, the small number of participants in the study favors the null hypothesis because insufficient statistical power was presented for verifying whether the small differences observed between the interventions were significant. On the other hand, the lack of standardisation in the analyses of the outcomes made it impossible to conduct a meta-analysis in most instances. It could only be done for the arousal index found in two studies.</P>
<P>The outcomes from the studies were measured in a variety of ways. Those that analysed sleep variables and the bruxism index used the polysomnography test as a tool both for diagnosing the disease and for assessing the efficacy of the treatment. Temporomandibular joint (TMJ) pain was evaluated by means of palpation and headache by means of the patient's reports. Clicks in the TMJ were evaluated by means of opening and closing the mouth. Analysis of the increased tooth wear was carried out by means of using plaster models. Finally, the comfort factor in using the device was evaluated by means of a visual analogue scale (VAS) and the patients were asked directly about their preferences regarding the devices.</P>

<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Dube-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Dube 2004</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Van-der-Zaag-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Van der Zaag 2005</LINK>, compared the occlusal splint with the palatal splint for sleep variables and the sleep bruxism index. The sleep variables were sleep efficiency, total sleep duration, arousal index and awakenings index. The variables for the sleep bruxism index were assessed in two categories: number of bruxism episodes per hour (using electromyography) and episodes with grinding noise. No statistically significant differences were found between the occlusal splints and palatal splints for any of the abovementioned outcomes. Meta-analysis was conducted only on the arousal index outcome, and the difference found for this outcome can be explained by the clinical heterogeneity of the patients between the two studies. In other words, the degree of severity of the bruxism between the participants in the two studies was probably significantly different. Another relevant point is the difference in age between the patients in these two groups: in the study by <LINK REF="STD-Dube-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Dube 2004</LINK>, the patients were much younger and this may explain the lower arousal index. Moreover, in the study by <LINK REF="STD-Van-der-Zaag-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Van der Zaag 2005</LINK>, the first-night effect may have occurred, in that the data were collected on the first night that the test was conducted. On the other hand, in the study by <LINK REF="STD-Dube-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Dube 2004</LINK>, this effect was minimised through adapting the patient to the laboratory on the first night and only collecting data on the second night.</P>
<P>The occlusal alteration produced by the occlusal splint did not provide results differing from the results using the palatal splint (which did not modify the occlusion). Thus, it can be considered that the presence or absence of occlusal protection provided by the devices did not present significant differences for the outcomes of sleep variables and sleep bruxism index. This lack of differences suggests that the effects from therapy using these devices may occur independently of the type of splint utilised. Therefore, although the two devices are different, they may have the same type of influence on oral behaviour, such as salivation and deglutition (<LINK REF="REF-Kato-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kato 2003</LINK>). In fact, the role of occlusal interference in the aetiology of bruxism is increasingly questioned. Even though the removal of occlusal interference has been one of the mechanisms for explaining the action of the occlusal splint, <LINK REF="REF-Bailey-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bailey 1980</LINK> demonstrated that the occlusal adjustment did not eliminate sleep bruxism. During the same period, <LINK REF="REF-Greene-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Greene 1982</LINK> showed through epidemiological data that bruxers could not be distinguished morphologically from non-bruxers. More recently, in a case control study, <LINK REF="REF-Lobbezoo-2001-b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lobbezoo 2001 b</LINK> did not find differences between normal subjects and bruxers for morphological and occlusal variables. The same author (<LINK REF="REF-Lobbezoo-2001-a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lobbezoo 2001 a</LINK>) discusses that bruxism is principally regulated by a central pathophysiological mechanism that is modulated by neurotransmitters in the central nervous system (<LINK REF="REF-Lobbezoo-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lobbezoo 1997</LINK>) and is behavioural, rather than being due to a peripheral cause such as bone morphology alterations and occlusal alterations. At present there are no reliable data that would support a role for the occlusion in bruxism.</P>
<P>Another mechanism proposed for explaining the action of the occlusal splint in bruxism cases is the change in muscle activity and modification in the patients' habits caused by the splint. Although some studies have correlated the use of the occlusal splint with decreased muscle activity, this effect only lasts while the treatment is utilised (<LINK REF="STD-Pierce-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Pierce 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sheikholeslam-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Sheikholeslam 1986</LINK>). The use of such splints has been proposed for preventing bruxism from damaging the periodontal zone and the teeth against the adverse effects of prolonged overload.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="2">Pain outcomes</HEADING>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Alvarez_x002d_Arenal-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Alvarez-Arenal 2002</LINK> compared the occlusal splint with TENS for TMJ pain and headache outcomes, although none of these events occurred within this sample. This absence may have occurred because of the small number of participants in the study. It is worth emphasising that this study differed from the others in that the occlusal splint used was mandibular, which may have given different results. For the headache outcome, <LINK REF="STD-Sheikholeslam-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Sheikholeslam 1993</LINK> found an improvement of 82% in the chronic signs and symptoms relating to craniomandibular dysfunction in patients with sleep bruxism, following the use of the maxillary occlusal splint. Thus, improvements in TMJ pain and headache were observed. However, despite these findings, it is important to emphasise that this study was a case series without a control group. In a recent retrospective study, bruxers were compared with normal individuals and a high prevalence of headache and shoulder and neck pain was found among the bruxers (<LINK REF="REF-Huynh-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Huynh 2006</LINK>). Outcomes such as morning pain, which has been reported by some patients who ground their teeth during the night (<LINK REF="REF-Dao-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dao 1994</LINK>), were not assessed in any of the trials included in the present review. Painful processes such as morning headache, or muscle discomfort with or without pain, may interfere in daily activities and could have been measured by means of quality-of-life questionnaires.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Tooth wear outcomes</HEADING>
<P>Tooth wear was only analysed by <LINK REF="STD-Hachmann-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Hachmann 1999</LINK>, in a quasi-randomised study among children. This was done by means of analysing the increase in the size of wear facets. In this clinical trial, there was no significant difference in occlusal wear between patients who used the occlusal splint and those who did not receive treatment, although there was a tendency towards a greater proportion of patients benefitting from the use of the splint. Out of the five patients in the treatment group, only one presented wear on the incisal face of the canine analysed in the model, and these results were also verified in the incisal wear after 6 months. Because the wear in the treatment group occurred in a single individual, the authors discussed the hypothesis that this patient may not have used the device correctly. Despite the absence of significant difference in the results, there seems to be a consensus among the professionals that, by indicating the use of occlusal splints for patients with sleep bruxism, occlusal tooth wear and soft tissue trauma are prevented (<LINK REF="REF-Walker-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walker 1992</LINK>). This extremely important outcome was not analysed in adults, in any of the studies in the present review.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="2">Click outcomes</HEADING>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Alvarez_x002d_Arenal-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Alvarez-Arenal 2002</LINK> compared the occlusal splint with TENS, in patients with and without temporomandibular dysfunction (TMD). No statistically significant difference was found for the outcome of clicks in the TMJ, either when opening or when closing the joint.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Degree of comfort outcomes</HEADING>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Dube-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Dube 2004</LINK> compared the occlusal splint and palatal splint in relation to the degree of comfort. When the patients were asked which device type they preferred, they all said they preferred the palatal splint, rather than the occlusal splint, but when they were asked about the degree of comfort, measured using the VAS, they were evaluated as equally comfortable. 71% of the patients felt that the occlusal splint offered greater protection for their teeth. None of the patients reported a dry mouth during the night or in the morning with either of the two devices. The patients were interviewed again 1 year later. Five of the seven patients contacted were continuing to use the splints, of whom four used the occlusal splint and one preferred the palatal splint. In one other study on preferences regarding the type of device, <LINK REF="STD-Landry-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Landry 2006</LINK> showed that 12 out of their 13 patients preferred the occlusal splint to other device (mandibular advancement device free (MAD free)).</P>
<P>Although the action mechanism has not yet been fully explained, splints have been widely utilised for decades, and are seen as a successful therapeutic method (<LINK REF="REF-Carlson-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carlson 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Visser-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Visser 1995</LINK>). In the United States, it has been estimated that 1,200,000 occlusal splints are manufactured every year, for both children and adults. Since the cost per splint is 275 dollars, an estimated total of 330 million dollars per annum is spent on their production (<LINK REF="REF-Pierce-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pierce 1995</LINK>). Despite the high expenditure on these devices, no studies with any high degree of scientific reliability have been produced to justify their widespread use. The lack of reliable answers regarding the effectiveness of occlusal splints can mainly be attributed to the inadequate methodology of the studies conducted, such as the predominance of case series and case control studies, disregard for the natural course of the disease, the professional-patient relationship, and the lack of good quality randomised clinical trials with enough participants to give statistical power to the outcome analyses.</P>
<P>To answer the question regarding the effectiveness of the occlusal splint on tooth wear on the basis of calculating the sample size, if it is considered that 100% of cases wear tooth without treatment and 40% of cases wear tooth with treatment, and taking the statistical power to be 90% and alpha error of 5%, then at least 10 individuals would be needed in each group (treatment group and control group). Taking into consideration losses of around 20%, another four individuals would be added to each group, thus giving a total of 24 individuals.</P>

</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>The evidence is insufficient for affirming that the occlusal splint is effective for treating sleep bruxism. Indication of its use is questionable with regard to the sleep outcomes, but it may be that there is some benefit with regard to tooth wear.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>This review suggests that there is a need for more randomised controlled clinical trials that are well designed, in order to clarify whether there is any benefit from the occlusal splint in the treatment of sleep bruxism. <BR/>The method utilised in the randomisation (use of random number tables, randomisation generator, or others), and also concealment of the allocation (use of opaque sealed envelopes) must be appropriate and be described by the author. The study design must be parallel, in order to eliminate the bias provided by studies of cross-over type. Masking for evaluating the outcomes, for data analysis and, when possible, for the patient, must be implemented and described. The diagnostic criteria for sleep bruxism must be standardised in accordance with those of the American Sleep Disorders Association, as must the name to be utilised for the disease, so as to prevent possible misunderstandings regarding bruxism types. For example, the term 'nocturnal bruxism' is often used instead of 'sleep bruxism' but, obviously, people can sleep and grind their teeth both during the day and during the night. Outcomes such as tooth wear in adults, morning headache, morning fatigue, neck and shoulder pain, quality of life, tolerability of the devices, costs and patient satisfaction must be evaluated. The results must be expressed as risk ratios with 95% confidence intervals, or by means. If losses occurs, the analysis must be by intention-to-treat, and all the data must be described by the author. Attention must be paid to possible collateral effects that could appear during occlusal splint treatment. There is a need for a considerable length of follow up. <BR/>New studies could make comparisons between the occlusal splint group and other groups, such as: occlusal splint associated with transcutaneous electric nerve stimulation (TENS); occlusal splint and behavioural therapy; or occlusal splint and pharmacological intervention. Furthermore, standardisation with regard to the type of occlusal splint to be utilised must be implemented (maxillary or mandibular).</P>
<P>In summary, because of the limitations in the methods used in the studies included, it is recommended that future studies should include: randomised controlled studies with rigorous methodology; calculation to determine the sample size, in order to increase the power of the study for estimating the effect. It is also suggested that the guidelines produced by the CONSORT Group (<LINK REF="REF-CONSORT-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">CONSORT 2005</LINK>) should be followed, since their use would improve the quality of trials for managing the treatment of sleep bruxism. </P>

<P>Occlusal splint was a mandibular transparent thermopolymerising acrylic that was prepared via classical technique (fitting of models in a semiadjustable articulator). The occlusal surface was smooth and levelled with point form contacts, in centric relation, of the functional and non-functional antagonist cuspids of the posterior teeth. In the anterior sector of the splint the contacts of the anterior teeth were less pronounced, and the inclined planes for the canine and protrusive guides were well defined to provide immediate disocclusion of the posterior teeth during mandibular eccentric movements.</P>

<TD>
<P>Occlusal splint was a hard acrylic U-shaped occlusal splint. Maxillary and mandibular arch impressions were made with alginate and models were cast in artificial stone. The centric tooth relation was taken with a blue wax waffle. A face bow was used to mount the models on a semiadjustable articulator. The splint was made on the maxillary models and then inserted and adjusted. The adjustment was made in centric relation with the use of a 32-µm articulation paper. Only the points corresponding to contact between the lower buccal cusp and the splint were preserved. Adjustment of lateral guidance and protrusion was done by eliminating any contact other than with the canine in lateral or incisor in anterior-posterior mandibular movements.</P>

<P>Palatal splint (can be called palatal control device) was active control made on the maxillary models and then inserted and adjusted. The device did not interfere with the occlusion in any mandibular movements and it was adjusted for maximum tooth intercuspation, and any tooth contact upon mandibular movement was eliminated.</P>

<TD>
<P>Occlusal splint (called Michigan type bite plate) was a thermopolymerised colourness acrylic resin, worn in the maxilla, without palatal coverage. Maxillary and mandibular arch impressions were made with condensation silicone (Optosil -Xantopren ®) and models were cast in dental stone (Velmix ®). A face bow was used to mount the models on a semiadjustable articulator. The plate was built in wax (double layer of pink wax) being adapted over the maxillary arch teeth. The plate was1 to 3 mm in thickness, contact of all teeth in centric relation, disclusion of posterior teeth in lateral and in protusive movements, avoiding balancing side interferences through the anterior guidance.</P>

<P>Occlusal splint upper standard single was a classic hard acrylic resin. Dental impressions were made with irreversible hydrocolloid, and the working casts were poured with artificial stone (type III).
