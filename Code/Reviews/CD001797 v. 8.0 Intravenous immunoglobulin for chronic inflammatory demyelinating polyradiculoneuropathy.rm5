<P>
<B>Review question</B>
</P>
<P>We performed this review to assess the evidence from randomised trials on how effective and safe intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) is for people with CIDP. </P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP) is an illness in which nerves become inflamed and this leads to paralysis. The likely cause is that the body attacks its own nerves. CIDP usually requires long-term treatment to prevent further disability. There is much debate about the first choice of treatment. One choice is a medicine called immunoglobulin, which is a product made from purified antibodies from human donor blood and which is given via injection into a vein. Steroid drugs and plasma exchange (a treatment in which the plasma element of a person's blood is replaced), are known to be effective.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>Eight randomised controlled trials including 332 participants with CIDP were eligible for this review. These compared IVIg with placebo (dummy treatment), plasma exchange, or steroid drugs.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results and quality of the evidence</B>
</P>
<P>We found five randomised trials which together prove that IVIg improves disability more than placebo (dummy treatment). The results showed that three people would need to be treated for one person to improve. In the three trials that compared IVIg with other treatments, results with IVIg were similar to plasma exchange, oral prednisolone or intravenous methylprednisolone. The evidence was of moderate or high quality. In this review, there were mild and short-term side effects in around half of those who received IVIg. Six per cent of those treated with IVIg had serious side effects, which is a similar rate as with plasma exchange or corticosteroids.</P>
<P>Each trial defined improvement in its own way and the trials used different measurement scales, so it is difficult to relate them to changes in the clinical condition of people with CIDP. Only one of the studies that compared IVIg with placebo had a long-term follow-up. It suggested that IVIg improves disability more than placebo over 24 weeks and possibly 48 weeks. Further research is needed to compare the long-term benefits as well as side effects of IVIg with other treatments.</P>
<P>The most recent search for studies was in December 2012 and we updated the review with the results of one additional trial.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2013-11-19 11:12:19 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP) causes progressive or relapsing weakness and numbness of the limbs, developing over at least two months. Uncontrolled studies suggest that intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) helps. This review was first published in 2002 and has since been updated, most recently in 2013.</P>

<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2013-12-20 16:46:51 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>To review systematically the evidence from randomised controlled trials (RCTs) concerning the efficacy and safety of IVIg in CIDP.</P>

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2013-12-20 16:46:54 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>On 4 December 2012, we searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group Specialized Register, CENTRAL (2012, issue 11 in <I>the Cochrane Library</I>), MEDLINE and EMBASE to December 2012 and ISI from January 1985 to May 2008. We searched for ongoing trials through two metaRegistries (World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform Search Portal and Current Controlled Trials).</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2013-12-20 16:46:56 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We selected RCTs testing any dose of IVIg versus placebo, plasma exchange or corticosteroids in definite or probable CIDP.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2013-12-20 16:46:57 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Filip Eftimov">
<P>Two authors reviewed literature searches to identify potentially relevant RCTs, scored their quality and extracted data independently. We contacted authors for additional information.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-12-20 16:47:18 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We considered eight RCTs, including 332 participants, to be eligible for inclusion in the review. These trials were homogeneous and the overall risk of bias low. Five studies, in a total of 235 participants compared IVIg against placebo. One trial with 20 participants compared IVIg with plasma exchange, one trial compared IVIg with prednisolone in 32 participants, and one trial, newly included at this update, compared IVIg with intravenous methylprednisolone in 46 participants.</P>
<P>A significantly higher proportion of participants improved in disability within one month after IVIg treatment as compared with placebo (risk ratio (RR) 2.40, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.72 to 3.36; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome 3.03 (95% CI 2.33 to 4.55), high quality evidence). Whether all these improvements are equally clinically relevant cannot be deduced from this analysis because each trial used different disability scales and definitions of significant improvement. In three trials, including 84 participants, the disability score could be transformed to the modified Rankin score, on which improvement of one point after IVIg treatment compared to placebo was barely significant (RR 2.40, 95% CI 0.98 to 5.83) (moderate quality evidence). Only one placebo-controlled study included in this review had a long-term follow-up. The results of this study suggest that IVIg improves disability more than placebo over 24 and 48 weeks.</P>
<P>The mean disability score revealed no significant difference between IVIg and plasma exchange at six weeks (moderate quality evidence). There was no significant difference in improvement in disability on prednisolone compared with IVIg after two or six weeks, or on methylprednisolone compared to IVIg after two weeks or six months (moderate quality evidence).</P>
<P>There were no statistically significant differences in frequencies of side effects between the three types of treatment for which data were available (IVg versus placebo or steroids). (moderate or high quality evidence) Mild and transient adverse events were found in 49% of participants treated with IVIg, while serious adverse events were found in six per cent.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2013-12-20 16:47:24 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The evidence from RCTs shows that IVIg improves disability for at least two to six weeks compared with placebo, with an NNTB of three. During this period it has similar efficacy to plasma exchange, oral prednisolone and intravenous methylprednisolone. In one large trial, the benefit of IVIg persisted for 24 and possibly 48 weeks. Further research is needed to compare the long-term benefits as well as side effects of IVIg with other treatments.<BR/>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2013-12-20 16:48:05 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP) is characterised by progressive or relapsing motor and/or sensory symptoms and signs in more than one limb, developing over at least two months (<LINK REF="REF-Barohn-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barohn 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ad-hoc-subcom-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ad hoc subcom 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Feasby-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Feasby 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Dyck-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dyck 1993</LINK>). Sensory disturbances are usually slight, but are found in approximately 80% of participants. Proximal and distal parts of the limbs are usually affected symmetrically. Atrophy is less marked than weakness. Loss of reflexes is found in almost all participants, but may be confined to the ankles. Cranial nerve involvement, sometimes preceding the neuropathy, has been reported infrequently (<LINK REF="REF-Donaghy-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Donaghy 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Barohn-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barohn 1989</LINK>).</P>
<P>The overall crude prevalence of definite and probable CIDP is 1 to 9 per 100,000 adults (<LINK REF="REF-Lunn-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lunn 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McLeod-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">McLeod 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Laughlin-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Laughlin 2009</LINK>) and 0.5 per 100,000 children (<LINK REF="REF-McLeod-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">McLeod 1999</LINK>). The estimated crude annual incidence is 0.15 to 1.6 per 100,000 adults. CIDP can cause prolonged periods of disability with 54% of people with CIDP becoming severely disabled (modified Rankin score of four or five) at some time during the illness (<LINK REF="REF-Lunn-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lunn 1999</LINK>). More than 10% of people remain severely disabled despite treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Lunn-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lunn 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Chi_x00f2_-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chiò 2007</LINK>). CIDP can occur at any age, with a peak prevalence in the sixth and seventh decade (<LINK REF="REF-McLeod-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">McLeod 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>The diagnosis of CIDP is based on the clinical, electrophysiological, cerebrospinal fluid features and, to a limited degree, on histopathology. Cerebrospinal fluid protein levels are generally elevated without cellular reaction (<LINK REF="REF-Dyck-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dyck 1993</LINK>). Electrophysiologically, the disease is characterised by reduced nerve conduction velocities, abnormal temporal dispersion and conduction block (<LINK REF="REF-Barohn-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barohn 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-van-der-Mech_x00e9_-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">van der Meché 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-van-Doorn-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Doorn 1991</LINK>). The pathological findings include multifocal demyelination, mononuclear cells in close approximation to demyelinated axons, remyelination, fibre loss and 'onion bulbs' (<LINK REF="REF-Barohn-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barohn 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Dyck-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dyck 1993</LINK>). Lymphocytic infiltration can be found in sural nerve biopsies, but, as may be expected from a predominantly motor neuropathy with multifocal involvement, biopsies are frequently normal (<LINK REF="REF-Matsumuro-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Matsumuro 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Molenaar-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Molenaar 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>CIDP has to be distinguished from Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS), the inherited demyelinating polyneuropathies, metabolic neuropathies (associated with diabetes, uraemia, acromegaly, hepatitis, amyloidosis, and hypothyroidism), paraneoplastic neuropathies, neuropathies associated with monoclonal gammopathies, neuropathies associated with human immunodeficiency virus or Lyme disease, and multifocal motor neuropathy. CIDP is often considered to be a chronic variant of GBS. Differentiation of the two disorders relies on arbitrary clinical criteria of the time necessary to reach maximum deficit. In GBS this is less than four weeks and in CIDP more than eight weeks (<LINK REF="REF-Ad-hoc-subcom-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ad hoc subcom 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Feasby-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Feasby 1992</LINK>). Apart from the time course, the prognosis of CIDP is worse than GBS. More than 80% of participants fail to make a spontaneous recovery. The distinction between CIDP and GBS is important because the course, treatment and outcome are different (<LINK REF="REF-Pollard-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pollard 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Simmons-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Simmons 1993</LINK>).</P>
<P>CIDP is an immune mediated disorder. A beneficial effect of immunosuppressive therapy (e.g. corticosteroids) and plasma exchange has been demonstrated in randomised clinical trials (RCTs) (<LINK REF="REF-Server-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Server 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gross-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gross 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Dyck-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dyck 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Dyck-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dyck 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-van-der-Mech_x00e9_-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">van der Meché 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Briellmann-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Briellmann 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hahn-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hahn 1998</LINK>). Several uncontrolled studies have suggested a beneficial effect of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) administration (<LINK REF="REF-Vermeulen-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vermeulen 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-van-der-Mech_x00e9_-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">van der Meché 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Faed-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Faed 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-van-Doorn-1990b" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Doorn 1990b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-van-Doorn-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Doorn 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cornblath-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cornblath 1991</LINK>). The mode or modes by which IVIg exerts this beneficial effect in CIDP are not clear, but various mechanisms of improvement after IVIg treatment have been suggested (<LINK REF="REF-van-Schaik-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Schaik 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Yu-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yu 1999</LINK>). Studies in other diseases treated with IVIg have demonstrated that IVIg may inhibit autoantibody production, neutralise pathogenic antibodies, and decrease antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity by blocking Fc-receptors on macrophages (<LINK REF="REF-Kazatchkine-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kazatchkine 2001</LINK>). Furthermore, peripheral blood from patients treated with IVIg shows increased CD8-positive suppressor T-cell function.</P>
<P>No systematic review had been published before the first version of this Cochrane review appeared in 2002. We here provide the most recent update of this systematic review of randomised trials of IVIg for the treatment of CIDP.</P>

<P>Eligible studies had to include participants with definite or probable CIDP. This was defined as an illness with symptoms and signs of polyneuropathy in the absence of systemic disease, electrophysiological diagnosis of a demyelinating polyneuropathy (based on reduced nerve conduction velocities and or conduction blocks consistent with demyelination) and progression of weakness exceeding eight weeks. Increased cerebrospinal fluid protein (more than 0.5 g/L) without a pleocytosis was considered supportive, but not essential for the diagnosis. It was necessary for participants to have a normal erythrocyte sedimentation rate, haematocrit, white cell and platelet counts, serum creatinine, serum glucose, and liver and thyroid function tests, absent antinuclear antibodies, cryoglobulins, and monoclonal proteins, and a normal chest radiograph. Participants were excluded if they had mutilation of hands or feet, retinitis pigmentosa, ichthyosis, drug or toxic exposure known to cause a peripheral neuropathy, a family history of demyelinating polyneuropathy, clinical suspicion of a vasculitic disorder, sensory level at examination, or unequivocal sphincter disturbances. A nerve biopsy was not mandatory.</P>
<P>We set no restriction on appropriate settings for trials in this review. However, considering the challenge of diagnosing and treating people with CIDP, hospitals and neuromuscular centres are likely to be the usual settings.<BR/>

<P>Since different studies used different disability scales, we defined the primary outcome measure as the proportion of participants with a significant improvement in disability within six weeks after the onset of treatment as determined and defined by the original authors. In each study the strictest available criteria to define 'significant' improvement were used. Where possible, we transformed disability data to the modified six-point Rankin disability scale (<LINK REF="REF-de-Haan-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">de Haan 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>). We asked all authors of included trials for original data to enable this transformation. We defined a significant improvement as at least one point improvement on this scale. No change or worsening on the Rankin scale was rated as no improvement.</P>
<P>Secondary outcome measures were:<BR/>(i) the change in mean disability score assessed within six weeks after the onset of treatment and compared to baseline;<BR/>(ii) the change in mean Medical Research Council (MRC) sum score assessed within six weeks after the onset of treatment and compared to baseline;<BR/>(iii) the change in mean disability score at 24 weeks or more;<BR/>(iv) the frequency of serious side effects;<BR/>(v) the frequency of any side effects.</P>
<P>In these analyses, for clarity of interpretation, we considered the Rankin disability scale and MRC sum score to be quasi-linear scales.</P>

<P>In the original protocol and earlier versions of the review we assessed methodological quality using a method as proposed by Mulrow and Gillespie (<LINK REF="REF-Mulrow-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mulrow 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gillespie-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gillespie 1998</LINK>). Following the updated guidance in Chapter 8 of the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> 5.0.1 (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2008</LINK>, updated <LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>), we completed a 'Risk of bias' table, addressing the following domains: sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding, incomplete outcome data, selective outcome reporting, and other issues. We made a judgement about the risk of bias for each entry, such that a judgement of 'Low' indicated a low risk of bias, 'High' indicated a high risk of bias, and 'Unclear' indicated unclear or unknown risk of bias.<BR/>

<EFFECT_MEASURES MODIFIED="2013-12-20 17:04:35 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Ruth Brassington">
<P>For dichotomous data, such as the proportion of participants with a significant improvement in disability, we calculated the risk ratio (RR) for each study with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). To assess overall efficacy from all the studies, we calculated pooled RR estimates with 95% CIs. For the primary outcome we also calculated numbers needed to treat for an additional beneficial effect (NNTB) with inversed CIs of the risk differences.</P>
<P>For continuous data we used mean difference (MD) and 95% CI when outcomes were measured on the same scale. We anticipated that different trials would use different scales to measure the same secondary outcomes. In this case we calculated a standardised mean difference (SMD) and 95% CI. SMD is a dimensionless measure of effect for continuous data which is useful in combining results of individual studies in which the same outcome is measured with different instruments or scales. The SMD was defined as the mean change in score of the placebo group minus mean change in score of the treatment group, divided by the pooled standard deviation of the change in scores of the two groups.</P>
<P>Means and standards deviations have been derived by calculation or extraction from the available published or received unpublished data. To assess overall efficacy, we calculated pooled MD or SMD estimates using a random-effects or fixed-effect model depending on heterogeneity of study results.</P>

<UNIT_OF_ANALYSIS MODIFIED="2013-12-20 16:49:42 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We analysed the results from cross-over trials in two ways: (1) we considered cross-over trials as two consecutive parallel design trials assuming that no carryover effect had occurred; this is considered to be a conservative analysis method (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2008</LINK>). We included data from participants who did not cross over to the second treatment because of improvement during the first treatment period in analyses for the first treatment only; (2) we analysed cross-over trials making use of the generic inverse variance (GIV) approach, using the natural logarithms of the RR and standard error (SE) which avoids the error of falsely wide CIs of cross-over studies leading to less weight and therefore possibly disguising clinically important heterogeneity (<LINK REF="REF-Elbourne-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elbourne 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2008</LINK>). In the text pooled RR estimates are given separately for all studies and for the parallel design trials only.</P>
<P>For cross-over studies, we calculated correlation coefficients for all outcomes, when possible. If paired results were not reported in a study, paired analyses were approximated by assuming the correlation between treatment and placebo found in the other studies. We subsequently undertook a sensitivity analysis using different values of correlation to assess the impact of the assumed correlation. We used the GIV method to pool both the SMD and MD of individual cross-over studies.<BR/>

Five RCTs compared intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) treatment with placebo, one compared IVIg with plasma exchange (<LINK REF="STD-Dyck-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Dyck 1994</LINK>), one compared IVIg with prednisolone (<LINK REF="STD-Hughes-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Hughes 2001</LINK>) and one compared IVIg with intravenous methylprednisolone (IVMP) (<LINK REF="STD-Nobile_x002d_Orazio-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Nobile-Orazio 2012</LINK>).

A total of 2 g/kg bodyweight of IVIg was administered in each trial over two (<LINK REF="STD-Hughes-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Hughes 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mendell-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Mendell 2001</LINK>), two to four (<LINK REF="STD-Hughes-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Hughes 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nobile_x002d_Orazio-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Nobile-Orazio 2012</LINK>), or five days (<LINK REF="STD-Vermeulen-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Vermeulen 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hahn-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Hahn 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Thompson-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Thompson 1996</LINK>).

In the latter trial, participants treated with IVMP received a total of 2 g of IVMP over four consecutive days every four weeks (<LINK REF="STD-Nobile_x002d_Orazio-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Nobile-Orazio 2012</LINK>). In the trial comparing IVIg with prednisolone, a six-week course of oral prednisolone tapering from 60 mg to 10 mg daily was given (<LINK REF="STD-Hughes-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Hughes 2001</LINK>). One study administered a total of 1.8 g/kg bodyweight of IVIg in a course of six weeks and compared this treatment with plasma exchange twice weekly for three weeks, then once weekly for another three weeks (<LINK REF="STD-Dyck-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Dyck 1994</LINK>). Each study used different outcome measures. More details of these studies are in <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>.</P>
<P>The largest study was a randomised response-conditional cross-over design study (<LINK REF="STD-Hughes-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Hughes 2008</LINK>). Participants who did not achieve improvement upon appointed treatment received the alternate treatment during the first study period. After 24 weeks only those participants who improved during the first study period were re-randomised for an extension phase of another 24 weeks. In both periods, participants switched to the alternate treatment in the event of deterioration on an adjusted Inflammatory Neuropathy Cause and Treatment (INCAT) disability scale. Primary outcome was defined as the percentage of participants who improved and maintained improvement from baseline at the adjusted INCAT disability score. For the purpose of this review, we analysed only the first treatment period because the sample entering the extension phase was largely biased. The first period can be considered to be a parallel group trial since the cross-over only took place in participants who did not improve. The trial authors provided original data at six weeks from the first study period. We used the number of participants who achieved sufficient improvement by six weeks (and thus were not crossed over by six weeks) in the meta-analysis for the primary outcome of this review.<BR/>
<BR/>We obtained Individual patient data from five studies (<LINK REF="STD-Vermeulen-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Vermeulen 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Thompson-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Thompson 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hughes-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Hughes 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hughes-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Hughes 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nobile_x002d_Orazio-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Nobile-Orazio 2012</LINK>).

<LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK> gives the review authors' judgements for each 'Risk of bias' domain for each trial. One of the five RCTs comparing IVIg with placebo did not contain adequate information to judge allocation sequence generation and concealment (<LINK REF="STD-Thompson-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Thompson 1996</LINK>). In one study the blinding of outcome assessors was not described in detail (<LINK REF="STD-Mendell-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Mendell 2001</LINK>), although risk of bias due to lack of blinding of assessors was considered to be low. In all five studies, all outcomes stated in the methods section were also reported in the results section. In one study, additional treatment was stated but trivial confounding could be expected (<LINK REF="STD-Hahn-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Hahn 1996</LINK>), while in another study additional treatment was not mentioned (<LINK REF="STD-Thompson-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Thompson 1996</LINK>). One study assessed the primary outcome between days 16 and 21, which was just below the cut-off level of three weeks which we took as the lower limit of a clinically appropriate study duration (<LINK REF="STD-Vermeulen-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Vermeulen 1993</LINK>), while another study assessed outcomes at two weeks, which we considered not to be a clinically appropriate study duration (<LINK REF="STD-Thompson-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Thompson 1996</LINK>). Intention-to-treat analysis was not possible in one study as the outcome data of three participants who dropped out could not be collected (<LINK REF="STD-Mendell-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Mendell 2001</LINK>). One study used a response-conditional cross-over design, which means that not all participants received both treatments (<LINK REF="STD-Hahn-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Hahn 1996</LINK>). Imbalance in recruitment and a prestudy design for block randomisation by participating centres accounted for a discrepancy in the number of participants in the groups (<LINK REF="STD-Mendell-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Mendell 2001</LINK>). One study did not provide electrophysiological criteria for the definition of a demyelinating polyneuropathy (<LINK REF="STD-Vermeulen-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Vermeulen 1993</LINK>), although it is not likely that this has led to selection bias. The largest study was in essence a parallel design study with a conditional cross-over 'escape' for those participants who did not improve sufficiently (<LINK REF="STD-Hughes-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Hughes 2008</LINK>). The study was of a high quality and provided the longest follow-up.</P>
<P>The RCT comparing IVIg with plasma exchange did not contain adequate information to judge allocation sequence generation and concealment and did not perform an intention-to-treat analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Dyck-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Dyck 1994</LINK>). Also, participants and treatment providers were not blinded in this study, although we considered that the risk of this introducing bias was low.</P>
<P>In the RCT comparing IVIg with prednisolone, some unblinding of treatment providers was expected to have taken place (<LINK REF="STD-Hughes-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Hughes 2001</LINK>). Not all participants entered the cross-over phase owing to the use of a response-conditional cross-over design. Primary analysis was performed only for participants completing both treatments.</P>
<P>The study comparing IVIg with IVMP was of high quality with an adequate follow-up period of six months during treatment, followed by six months off treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Nobile_x002d_Orazio-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Nobile-Orazio 2012</LINK>). Original data on disability, Rankin score and MRC sum score were provided at 15 days, two months and six months. We used disability and Rankin scores at 15 days for the primary outcome, as the two-month and six-month follow-up were longer than the upper limit of six weeks chosen as an appropriate treatment duration for assessment of short-term efficacy. Except for some nonsignificant imbalances in baseline characteristics between both treatment groups (younger age, less disability, more frequent IVIg treatment prior to study and less comorbidity in the IVIg treatment group), we did not identify other risks of bias.</P>

Intravenous immunoglobulin was given 141 times and placebo 128 times. These 269 treatments were given in 198 participants included in three parallel design trials (104 participants assigned to IVIg, 94 to placebo) and 37 participants included in two cross-over trials. Of the 37 participants in the cross-over trials, three participants did not cross over to the second treatment because of improvement during the first treatment period (<LINK REF="STD-Hahn-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Hahn 1996</LINK>). All these participants were subsequently found to be on the active treatment, meaning that 37 IVIg and 34 placebo treatments were administered.

A significant improvement was reported in 78 out of 141 IVIg treatments and spontaneous improvements in 30 out of 128 placebo treatments. A significantly higher proportion of participants improved after IVIg therapy as compared with placebo, with a pooled RR of 2.40 (95% CI 1.72 to 3.36). The NNTB was 3.03 (95% CI 2.33 to 4.55). The study results were homogeneous (Chi<SUP>2 </SUP>statistic 3.34 df = 4, P = 0.50).

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Improvement of one or more points on Rankin scale (Analysis 1.3)</HEADING>
<P>One trial used the Rankin scale to assess disability (<LINK REF="STD-Vermeulen-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Vermeulen 1993</LINK>). In two trials it was possible to transform the disability scale to a six-point Rankin score. One trial used a functional disability score designed by Hughes (<LINK REF="STD-Mendell-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Mendell 2001</LINK>), which was transformed according to <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK> for the available cases only. The authors of another trial provided us with individual patient data and scored their participants on the Rankin disability scale (<LINK REF="STD-Thompson-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Thompson 1996</LINK>). In two trials, disability outcome could not be transformed to the Rankin scale with the data available from the papers (<LINK REF="STD-Hahn-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Hahn 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hughes-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Hughes 2008</LINK>). Therefore we analysed three RCTs including 84 participants for this comparison. Six of those 84 participants were included in a cross-over trial, resulting in 90 treatments. An improvement of one or more points on the Rankin scale occurred in 16 out of 50 participants treated with IVIg and in five out of 40 participants treated with placebo.</P>
<P>The proportion of participants with improvement (at least one point decrease on this scale) was higher in the IVIg group compared to the placebo group (RR 2.40 (95% CI 0.98 to 5.83)). This just reached significance. The NNTB was 5.26 (95% CI 2.78 to 50.00). The study results were also homogeneous (Chi<SUP>2</SUP> statistic 1.74, df = 2, P = 0.42). Leaving out the cross-over trial (<LINK REF="STD-Thompson-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Thompson 1996</LINK>), significant improvement was reported in 15 out of 44 IVIg treatments and 5 out of 34 placebo treatments, with an RR of 2.34 (95% CI 0.92 to 5.94), NNTB 5.26 (95% CI 2.7 to 100.00). The study results were homogeneous (Chi<SUP>2</SUP> statistic 1.69, df = 1, P value = 0.19).

<P>We analysed the disability scores from five trials, including 215 participants. In <LINK REF="STD-Hahn-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Hahn 1996</LINK>, SDs of the MD of the sham group were estimated using the correlation coefficient of 0.5 calculated from the MD and its SD from the IVIg group. A sensitivity analysis showed this to be a somewhat conservative but robust estimate. The results of the five RCTs were highly heterogeneous for this analysis (Chi<SUP>2</SUP> statistic = 54.95, df = 4, P &lt; 0.00001). This is not unexpected since various scales with different numeric intervals and maximal and minimal scores had been used to assess disability. The pooled SMD for all studies was 1.37 (95% CI 0.22 to 2.53). This indicates that the mean of the treated group was approximately one standard deviation higher than the mean of the untreated group.</P>
<P>We used the GIV method to analyse this outcome for the cross-over trials separately, to account for paired observations (<LINK REF="CMP-001.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.5</LINK>). The pooled estimate of the SMD was almost the same as in the previous analysis (2.84, 95% CI -1.46 to 7.13).</P>

This resulted in a MD that was significant, 0.26 (95% CI 0.05 to 0.48). Studies were homogeneous (Chi<SUP>2</SUP> statistic = 2.30, df = 2, P = 0.32).

Seven participants received placebo and IVIg in a cross-over trial; 28 participants received either IVIg (n = 15) or placebo (n = 13) in a parallel study design.

<HEADING LEVEL="2">IVIg versus placebo</HEADING>
<P>In the trials comparing IVIg with placebo a significantly higher proportion of participants improved in disability within six weeks after the onset of treatment with IVIg compared with placebo, RR 2.40 (95% CI 1.72 to 3.36) and an NNTB of 3.03 (95% CI 2.33 to 4.55) (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>). For the parallel design trials only, the RR was 2.14 (95% CI 1.48 to 3.09) and NNTB was 3.33 (95% CI 2.38 to 5.88). Whether all these improvements are equally clinically relevant cannot be derived from this analysis because each RCT used a different disability scale with a unique definition of a significant improvement. To overcome this problem an attempt was made to transform the various disability scales to the modified Rankin score. Again a significantly higher proportion of participants improved one point on the Rankin scale after IVIg treatment than after placebo (RR 2.40, 95% CI 0.98 to 5.83, NNTB 5.26, 95% CI 2.78 to 50.00).</P>
<P>The change in mean disability score on the scale used in the original studies and on the Rankin scale were in favour of IVIg. The change in MRC sum score was not significantly different between placebo and IVIg treated participants.</P>
<P>Disability scores at 24 weeks or more were only available from the largest trial, with 117 participants, in which an initial loading dose of 2 g/kg was followed by a maintenance dose of 1 g/kg every three weeks (<LINK REF="STD-Hughes-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Hughes 2008</LINK>). After 24 weeks of treatment, disability improved with a mean change from baseline of 1.1 (SD 1.8) in the IVIg treatment group and 0.3 (SD) 1.3) in the placebo treatment group. The MD was 0.8 (95% CI 0.23 to 1.37) favouring IVIg. At the end of the first 24 weeks of treatment 32/59 (54%) participants in the IVIg group had a favourable response, whereas only 12/58 (21%) participants in the placebo group had improved. The absolute risk reduction (ARR) is thus 34% (95% CI 17.00 to 50.00), which gives a NNTB of 2.94 (95% CI 2.00 to 5.88). In the 24-week extension phase of the study most participants were re-randomised to IVIg or placebo. In the IVIg group, 37/43 (86%) participants had no relapse and remained clinically stable or improved, whereas 16/31 (52%) participants in the placebo group had no relapse; ARR 34% (95% CI 14.00 to 55.00) with a NNTB of 2.94 (95% CI 1.82 to 7.13). The results of the extension phase were not included in the analyses because this sample was largely biased. Similarly, due to treatment bias, a proof-of-principle study was excluded in which seven participants known to respond to IVIg therapy discontinued treatment and after deterioration were subsequently treated with IVIg or placebo in a double-blind, cross-over design. IVIg resulted in improvement in all participants, placebo in none (<LINK REF="STD-van-Doorn-1990a" TYPE="STUDY">van Doorn 1990a</LINK>).</P>

<P>We excluded a single-blind parallel design trial that compared two doses of IVIg to a special plasma exchange system: low dose IVIg (0.5 g/kg/day in two days), high IVIg dose (1 g/kg/day in two days) and Excorim staphylococcal protein immunoadsorption plasma exchange (<LINK REF="STD-Zinman-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Zinman 2005</LINK>). The advantage of this selective adsorption of immunoglobulin is that it reduces plasma protein and fluid loss caused by conventional plasma exchange. The study was of poor quality: from the 20 included participants only six participants from the high IVIg dose group and four participants from the immunoadsorption group completed the trial. Our primary outcome (proportion of participants with improvement within six weeks) could not be assessed as there were only two and six months assessments available. Furthermore, disability at six months could not be extracted from the paper as a composite of different outcomes was used to define clinical improvement. According to the paper three out of six participants treated with IVIg and all four participants treated with immunoadsorption improved. Considering the small number of participants larger trials will be needed to assess the efficacy and safety of immunoadsorption.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="2">IVIg versus prednisolone</HEADING>
<P>In the study comparing prednisolone with IVIg there were no significant differences between the two treatment arms for the primary outcomes of this systematic review (<LINK REF="SOF-03" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 3</LINK>). Also, no significant difference in mean improvement on the disability scale was found at two weeks, six weeks and analysing the first treatment arm only between prednisolone and IVIg. On the Rankin scale participants improved equally. The other outcome measures revealed no significant differences between the two treatment arms. Disability scores at 24 weeks were not assessed or reported.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">IVIg versus intravenous methylprednisolone</HEADING>
<P>There were no differences between monthly IVIg and IVMP treatment in the primary and secondary outcomes of this meta-analysis (<LINK REF="SOF-04" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 4</LINK>). However, the trial showed that IVIg is significantly less frequently discontinued than IVMP based on inefficacy, adverse events or intolerance which was the primary outcome of the study. Alternatively, 38% of the participants who improved after IVIg worsened within six months after stopping treatment, compared to none of the participants improving on IVMP.</P>
<P>Taken together these results show that IVIg treatment is superior to placebo in inducing an improvement in participants with CIDP regardless of whether this improvement is assessed by disability or impairment. However, the effect on disability was more pronounced and is, in our opinion, clinically far more relevant for the participant. Participants improved spontaneously in 30 out of 128 cases (23%), but treatment with IVIg increased their chance of improvement to 55% (78 out of 141 participants). The ARR is 32% which gives a NNTB of 3.03 (95% CI 2.33 to 4.55). In other words, if treated with IVIg one in every three participants will improve due to this treatment. However, if ten participants are treated with IVIg, three will improve due to the therapy, but approximately two participants will improve spontaneously and four participants will not improve and need additional treatment. Long-term results from the largest study shows an almost equal beneficial effect of IVIg treatment for up to 24 with an ARR of 34% and an NNTB of 2.94 (95% CI 2.00 to 5.88). Since only 3 out of 10 IVIg courses are expected to cause improvement and the costs of IVIg are high, cost-benefit studies are urgently needed to estimate the cost-effectiveness of this treatment.</P>
<P>IVIg appears to be equally as effective as plasma exchange, prednisolone and intravenous methylprednisolone, with some reservations. Firstly, the plasma exchange versus IVIg trial used an unusual dose and regimen of IVIg and had some major methodological shortcomings. Secondly, the prednisolone versus IVIg trial was terminated prematurely because trial medication expiry date was reached before all the intended 40 participants could be accrued. Moreover this trial was not designed and powered to detect equivalence between the two treatments. Furthermore, the regimen of prednisolone chosen was relatively short and not typical of clinical practice for the treatment of participants with CIDP. If prednisolone had been given in a more protracted regimen and had been compared with standard IVIg treatment, it might have been superior. Finally, in the trial comparing IVIg and IVMP, we used outcomes at 15 days as defined by our study protocol. Although in favour of IVIg, the proportion of participants improving on disability did not differ significantly between both groups, which was also the case when outcomes were assessed at two months (data not shown) and six months (<LINK REF="CMP-004.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.6</LINK>). Participants with lack of improvement within two months were switched to the alternative treatment. Studies with a follow-up that is too short might underestimate the treatment effect, especially in participants treated with corticosteroids, as recent evidence has shown more than half of IVIg responders improve between three and six weeks (<LINK REF="REF-Latov-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Latov 2010</LINK>) while the median time to improvement in participants treated with pulsed oral dexamethasone was 17 weeks (<LINK REF="REF-van-Schaik-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Schaik 2010</LINK>). The dose of methylprednisolone in this study is high compared with doses used in previous studies of corticosteroids (<LINK REF="REF-Lopate-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lopate 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Muley-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Muley 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-van-Schaik-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Schaik 2010</LINK>). The finding that the improvement in disability did not differ significantly between IVIg and IVMP could mean that higher dosing such as that used in this study is not necessary and will only lead to more adverse events. This could be an explanation for the high dropout rate at 15 days in the intravenous methylprednisolone group. Another problem might have been that more participants in the IVIg group were treated with IVIg previously and thus were known to be responsive to this treatment. Therefore, the design of the study could have overestimated the efficacy of IVIg.</P>
<P>One trial which has been excluded from analysis in this review for various reasons (see <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_EXCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of excluded studies</LINK>), compared three different IVIg doses (0.25, 1.0 and 2.0 g/kg) in 59 participants with CIDP and multifocal motor neuropathy (MMN) (<LINK REF="STD-Kubori-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Kubori 1999</LINK>). There was a beneficial treatment effect in respectively 15%, 21% and 60% of participants, illustrating that a lower dose of IVIg may not be effective.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Adverse events and safety</HEADING>
<P>In two trials side effects were not mentioned (Analysis 1.9; Analysis 1.10). Headache, nausea, chills and fever are quite common but transient side effects with IVIg treatment and were reported to occur in 82 out of 167 (49%) IVIg treated participants, in 25 out of 141 (18%) placebo treated participants, and in 11 out of 27 (41%) prednisolone treated participants. Serious side effects were encountered in 10 out of 172 (6%) IVIg treated participants, in 10 out of 143 (7%) placebo treated participants, in 2 out of 27 (7%) prednisolone treated participants and in 2 out of 17 (12%) plasma exchange participants. These differences were not statistically significant.</P>
<P>Most side effects of IVIg are mild and transient and estimated to occur in 1% to 15% of infusions (<LINK REF="REF-Duhem-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Duhem 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stiehm-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stiehm 1996</LINK>). Rashes, chills, fever, mild hypo- or hypertension, nausea, malaise, headache and mild arthralgias seem to be the most frequent. Occasionally a short-lasting aseptic meningitis may occur without or with only minimal long-term sequelae. The most worrisome albeit rare complications are severe and potentially fatal anaphylactic shock, stroke, and temporary renal impairment, which is relatively common in those participants with pre-existing renal disease. The exact incidence of these severe side effects is unknown. In an ongoing postmarketing clinical pharmacovigilance study an adverse reaction rate of less than 0.5% for more than 26,000 participant infusions and less than 4% in 2554 participants was reported (<LINK REF="REF-Martin-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Martin 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>In this review, mild and transient side effects were reported in 49% of IVIg-treated participants which is far more than has been reported in the 'non-randomised' literature (<LINK REF="REF-Duhem-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Duhem 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stiehm-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stiehm 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Martin-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Martin 2000</LINK>). Headache was the most frequent side effect. As cumulative percentages of all side effects were not given, we used the percentage of headache as an estimate of any side effect. This figure probably underestimates the side effects of IVIg. RCTs are not suitable for determining the frequency of side effects. Serious side effects were encountered in six per cent of IVIg treated participants which is more in line with previously published figures. In comparison with plasma exchange and prednisolone there were no significant differences in the occurrence of minor or major side effects. However, it should be noted that the number of plasma exchange treated participants was small compared to the number of IVIg-treated participants, thus the reported frequency of side effects in IVIg participants will be more accurate than in plasma exchange treated participants. Furthermore, serious side effects known to occur after prolonged treatment with steroids were not seen due to the very short prednisolone regimen given in this particular trial.</P>
<P>The overall risk of bias in the trials was low. The allocation concealment was adequate in five (<LINK REF="STD-Vermeulen-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Vermeulen 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hahn-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Hahn 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mendell-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Mendell 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hughes-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Hughes 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hughes-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Hughes 2008</LINK>) and unclear in two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Dyck-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Dyck 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Thompson-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Thompson 1996</LINK>). </P>
<P>It is noteworthy that there is no agreement on the correct scale to assess participants with CIDP for clinical trials. Even the Neurological Disability Scale (NDS) (now known as the Neuropathy Impairment Scale), which was used twice, was modified in the second trial (<LINK REF="STD-Hahn-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Hahn 1996</LINK>). The included trials used two types of NDS scales (<LINK REF="REF-Dyck-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dyck 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hahn-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Hahn 1996</LINK>), the Hammersmith Motor Ability Score (<LINK REF="REF-Scott-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scott 1982</LINK>), the functional disability score designed by Hughes (<LINK REF="REF-GBS-study-group-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">GBS study group 1985</LINK>), the modified Rankin scale (<LINK REF="REF-de-Haan-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">de Haan 1993</LINK>) and the INCAT disability score (<LINK REF="REF-Merkies-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Merkies 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hughes-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Hughes 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hughes-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Hughes 2008</LINK>). A recent review showed great diversity in outcome measures used in immune-mediated neuropathies (<LINK REF="REF-van-Nes-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Nes 2008</LINK>). There is a great need for standardisation of outcome measures used, to enable comparison of results between trials. To this end, an international database and The Peripheral Neuropathy Outcome Measures Standardisation (PeriNomS) study, has been initiated.</P>
<P>In clinical phase III trials, the primary outcome should be disability and not impairment as the primary question to be answered is whether a person with CIDP benefits from a particular treatment. Three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Dyck-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Dyck 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hahn-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Hahn 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Thompson-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Thompson 1996</LINK>), which included a total of 54 participants, did not use an appropriate scale to measure outcome adequately for this type of clinical trial.</P>
<P>CIDP is a chronic disease which can follow a chronic progressive or relapsing-remitting course. Outcomes were assessed at 14 days (<LINK REF="STD-Thompson-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Thompson 1996</LINK>), at 15 days (<LINK REF="STD-Nobile_x002d_Orazio-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Nobile-Orazio 2012</LINK>), at 16 to 21 days (<LINK REF="STD-Vermeulen-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Vermeulen 1993</LINK>), at 28 days (<LINK REF="STD-Hahn-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Hahn 1996</LINK>) and at 42 days (<LINK REF="STD-Mendell-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Mendell 2001</LINK>). Original INCAT disability scores and percentage of participants responding to treatment at six weeks were provided by the authors for this review (<LINK REF="STD-Hughes-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Hughes 2008</LINK>). Of all these trials, only the most recent study had a longer follow-up period, up to 48 weeks. In a chronic disease, the number of participants maintaining remission for a longer periods is of major importance. Future trials should therefore use long-term rather than short-term outcomes.</P>
<P>We analysed the results from the cross-over trials as if they had come from a parallel group trial assuming that no carryover effect had occurred. Analysing cross-over trials in this way leads to a conservative estimate. In the case of dichotomous data, this is not statistically ideal but is unavoidable if an effort is made to assess efficacy from all available studies. To overcome this problem, individual patient data analysis of all studies should be carried out. These data have already been obtained from two studies and two other investigators have promised to supply us with the necessary information in due course. In the meantime, in the text of the review, the dichotomous outcome parameters have been given separately for all trials and for the parallel design trials. We also provided a GIV analysis for the cross-over trials where appropriate. In general the effect estimates were not far from the original analyses. For the interpretation of the overall effect of IVIg it did not make a great difference.</P>
<P>All cross-over trials used a predefined set of rules to determine the length of the washout period in which participants were crossed over if they remain stable, if they did not improve enough or if they deteriorated, depending on the scale used. Participants with significant improvements had to deteriorate below a predefined level before cross over could take place. Some participants who did not deteriorate again were not crossed over at all. Only one study (<LINK REF="STD-Hughes-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Hughes 2001</LINK>) did a formal statistical test to exclude the possibility of a carry over effect. Nevertheless, we think it unlikely that a carry over effect accounts for the treatment effect found in this systematic review because of the extended washout periods used and the fact that the estimated treatment effects found in the various trials were all within the 95% CI of a funnel plot regardless of the design: parallel or cross-over (<LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK>). In the text, RRs are given separately for all studies and for the parallel design trials only (<LINK REF="STD-Vermeulen-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Vermeulen 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Thompson-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Thompson 1996</LINK>). We have sent a request for individual patient data to the principal investigators of the other trials.</P>
<P>We also planned to analyse other subgroups of interest because of their prognostic importance in previous prospective studies and trials (<LINK REF="REF-van-Doorn-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Doorn 1991</LINK>). One advantage of a systematic review is that data from an adequate number of participants might become available to detect significant differences between subgroups which were not apparent from individual trials. However, in none of the studies were enough data on subgroups available to allow such analyses.</P>
<P>Since IVIg, plasma exchange, prednisolone and IVMP seem to be equally effective in the treatment of people with CIDP, it is currently uncertain which of these should be the first choice. Costs, side effects, duration of treatment, dependency on regular hospital visits, and ease of administration all have a bearing on such a decision. Prednisolone treatment can be administered easily and is cheap. When compared to prednisolone treatment IVIg will be cost-effective only when one quality adjusted life year (QALY) is valued at over 250,000 Euro (<LINK REF="REF-McCrone-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">McCrone 2003</LINK>). However, adverse events due to long-term prednisolone treatment are not taken into account and would reduce the cost per QALY of IVIg treatment. Up to 70% of people with CIDP relapse when the dose of steroids is reduced and treatment schedules lasting two years have been recommended (<LINK REF="REF-Mehndiratta-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mehndiratta 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lindenbaum-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lindenbaum 2001</LINK>). The use of immunosuppressants and other immunomodulatory agents as adjuvant therapy have been advocated and the merits of these additional treatments have been discussed in detail in another systematic review (<LINK REF="REF-Mahdi_x002d_Rogers-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mahdi-Rogers 2013</LINK>). Only approximately 25% of people with CIDP do not need further steroid treatment because they have achieved a real clinical remission. Long-term treatment with prednisolone is accompanied by many serious side effects. Half-year treatment of corticosteroid pulses, which might reduce long-term side effects, might be sufficient in some people with CIDP (<LINK REF="STD-Nobile_x002d_Orazio-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Nobile-Orazio 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-van-Schaik-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Schaik 2010</LINK>). Plasma exchange is complicated, expensive and has no advantages over immunoglobulin treatment. Immunoglobulin treatment is expensive, usually needs a hospital setting to be administered, and must be repeated almost every month for many years to maintain the best possible functional status in people with CIDP.</P>

<P>The evidence from randomised controlled trials in chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP) shows that intravenous immunoglobulin improves disability for up to 24 and possibly 48 weeks compared with placebo, with a number needed to treat of three. Short-term use of intravenous immunoglobulin (up to six weeks) has similar efficacy to plasma exchange and oral prednisolone. Since intravenous immunoglobulin, plasma exchange, prednisolone and pulsed intravenous methylprednisolone seem to be equally effective, it is currently uncertain which of these treatments should be the first choice. Cost, side effects, duration of treatment, dependency on regular hospital visits and ease of administration all have to be considered before such a decision can be made.</P>

<SUP>1</SUP>The authors believe that quality of evidence is not optimal when based on the results of a single small trial, even in case of a high quality trial.</P>
<P>
<SUP>2</SUP>No serious adverse events were observed in participants treated with intravenous methylprednisolone (IVMP). However, this is probably the result of small numbers of treated patients. Observational studies with IVMP in CIDP are lacking. In one large retrospective study including people with multiple sclerosis, serious adverse events were reported in three of 187 (2%) participants (Mult Scler 2009;15(9):1085-91) Based on these data and clinical practice we estimate the risk of serious adverse events due to IVMP at 2 to 5 per 100.</P>
