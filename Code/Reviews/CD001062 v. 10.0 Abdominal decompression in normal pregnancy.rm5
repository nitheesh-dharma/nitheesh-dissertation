<SUMMARY>
<TITLE>Abdominal decompression in normal pregnancy</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Abdominal decompression is a procedure during which a negative pressure is applied intermittently to a pregnant woman's abdomen, enclosed within an airtight frame. It is thought to improve the mother's blood flow to the placenta, and during labour to relieve pain. The review of three studies of abdominal decompression used for healthy pregnant women found no benefits with respect to high blood pressure in the mother nor the newborn baby's condition and subsequent intellectual development. Avenues for further research remain.</P>

<ABSTRACT MODIFIED="2012-02-02 21:39:39 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Abdominal decompression was developed as a means of pain relief during labour. It has also been used for complications of pregnancy, and in healthy pregnant women in an attempt to improve fetal wellbeing and intellectual development. </P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>The objective of this review was to assess the effects of prophylactic abdominal decompression on pregnancy outcomes such as admission for pre-eclampsia, fetal growth, perinatal morbidity and mortality and childhood development.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2009-07-03 15:14:27 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Three studies were included. There was no difference between the abdominal decompression groups and the control groups for low birthweight (risk ratio (RR) 0.69, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.27 to 1.77) and perinatal mortality (RR 2.47, 95% CI 0.77 to 7.92). There were no differences in admission for pre-eclampsia, Apgar score and childhood development.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>There is no evidence to support the use of abdominal decompression in normal pregnancies. Future research should be directed towards the use of abdominal decompression during labour, and during complicated pregnancies.</P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2012-02-02 21:41:02 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Abdominal decompression was developed initially as a method of enhancing the forward movement of the uterus during labour contractions with a view to relieving pain. Unanticipated apparent beneficial effects on fetal wellbeing led to its investigation for this purpose (<LINK REF="REF-Hofmeyr-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hofmeyr 1989</LINK>). A rigid dome is placed about the abdomen and covered with an airtight suit. The space around the abdomen is decompressed to -50 to -100 mmHg for 15 to 30 seconds out of each minute for 30 minutes once to thrice daily, or with uterine contractions during labour. This is thought to 'pump' blood through the intervillous space.</P>
<P>Prophylactic abdominal decompression came into clinical use in the early 1960s on the basis of the results of several poorly controlled studies. These appeared to show that it improved fetal wellbeing and intellectual development. </P>
<P>Two prospective studies followed in which attempts were made to compare the outcome in women subjected to abdominal decompression with comparable control groups. </P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>To determine, from the best available evidence, the effects on admission for pre-eclampsia, fetal growth, perinatal morbidity and mortality and childhood development of prophylactic abdominal decompression.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Liddicoat-1968" TYPE="STUDY">Liddicoat 1968</LINK> allocated women using random numbers administered by an independent person to receive antenatal decompression or to attend routine physiotherapy classes. Evaluation of the offspring was carried out blind to the allocation of each child. The drop-out rate was high (from 45% at nine months to 56% by three years of age). However, significant selective drop-out bias seems unlikely because there is no reason to suspect an imbalance in the drop-out population, and the mean IQ of mothers remaining in the study remained comparable in both groups.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Hofmeyr-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Hofmeyr 1990</LINK> reviewed the original hospital notes of women in the study of <LINK REF="STD-Liddicoat-1968" TYPE="STUDY">Liddicoat 1968</LINK> to report on the perinatal data. Although 23% of results was unobtainable, there is again no reason to suspect that the composition of the groups was changed by the losses to follow up.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Coxon-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Coxon 1973</LINK> employed random selection and was able to blind the women and attendants to the allocation of each woman. However, the author's assumption that the 'placebo' treatment, consisting of abdominal decompression at minus 20 mmHg rather than minus 70 mmHg, would have little or no effect, is not necessarily valid.</P>
</STUDY_QUALITY>
<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
<P>Mathews and Loeffler found a slightly and statistically insignificantly greater increase in scalp blood pH after 20 contractions with abdominal decompression during labour than without (mean values +0.05 versus +0.01) (<LINK REF="STD-Mathews-1968" TYPE="STUDY">Mathews 1968</LINK>). </P>
<P>Data from the remaining studies reveal no difference between the antenatal abdominal decompression and control groups for the following parameters: admission for pre-eclampsia, low birthweight, and Apgar score below four at one minute. The perinatal mortality was not reduced. Indeed, there was a small excess of deaths in the decompression group, but this may be a chance occurrence. Childhood development measures were not statistically different.</P>
</INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>Those outcomes assessed in more than one trial yielded compatible results.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>These studies provide convincing evidence that antenatal abdominal decompression used in uncomplicated pregnancies does not improve any of the outcomes measured. There is thus no support for the clinical use of antenatal abdominal decompression as a prophylactic procedure.</P>
<P>Intrapartum abdominal decompression has not been evaluated sufficiently for its use to be recommended or rejected.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Two quite unexpected observations merit further investigation as they may provide clues to the existence of psychosocial interactions or physiological mechanisms not specific to abdominal decompression. The first is that in the study of <LINK REF="STD-Liddicoat-1968" TYPE="STUDY">Liddicoat 1968</LINK>, significantly more of the children in the abdominal decompression group were noted after three years to be undisciplined or aggressive (14/89 versus 2/90). The possibility that family expectations of superior intelligence gained from this or other childbirth techniques, may influence family dynamics and thus infant behaviour merits further investigation. The second interesting observation is that in the study of <LINK REF="STD-Coxon-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Coxon 1973</LINK>, placental weights in the high decompression group were significantly less than in the low decompression group (627 [9] versus 653 [9] grams [SEM]). This observation may have a bearing on mechanisms which determine placental mass. </P>
<P>Further investigation of abdominal decompression as such, should be directed towards its use in certain complications of pregnancy and during labour, not during uncomplicated pregnancies.</P>

<P>The drop-out rate was high (from 45% at 9 months to 56% by 3 years of age). However, significant selective dropout bias seems unlikely because there is no reason to suspect an imbalance in the drop-out population, and the mean IQ of mothers remaining in the study remained comparable in both groups.</P>
