<SUMMARY>
<TITLE>Evidence supporting colchicine for alcoholic, viral, and cryptogenic liver fibrosis/cirrhosis is still lacking</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Alcohol and hepatotropic viruses are major causes of liver fibrosis and liver cirrhosis. Colchicine is an anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic drug. This systematic review could not demonstrate any significant beneficial effects of colchicine on mortality, liver-related mortality, liver complications, liver biochemistry, or liver histology of patients with liver fibrosis or liver cirrhosis due to alcohol, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, or unknown etiology. Colchicine was associated with a significant increase in adverse events. Accordingly, there seems to be no evidence for using colchicine for alcoholic, viral, or cryptogenic liver fibrosis/cirrhosis outside randomised clinical trials.</P>
</SUMMARY_BODY>
</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Alcohol and hepatotropic viruses cause the majority of liver cirrhosis in the Western World. Colchicine is an anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic medication. Several randomised clinical trials have addressed the question whether colchicine has any efficacy in patients with alcoholic or non-alcoholic fibrosis and cirrhosis. </P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To assess the beneficial and harmful effects of colchicine in patients with alcoholic or non-alcoholic fibrosis or cirrhosis, excluding patients with primary biliary cirrhosis. </P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>
<I>The Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register</I>, <I>The Cochrane Controlled Trials Register on The Cochrane Library</I>, <I>MEDLINE</I>, <I>EMBASE</I>, <I>Science Citation Index Expanded,</I> and full text searches were combined (September 2004). Manufacturers and researchers in the field were also contacted. </P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>We included randomised trials irrespective of blinding, language, or publication status comparing per oral colchicine with placebo or no intervention for patients with fibrosis or cirrhosis induced by either alcohol, virus, or unknown factors (cryptogenic).</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>The statistical package (RevMan Analyses) provided by The Cochrane Collaboration was used. The methodological quality of the randomised clinical trials was evaluated. </P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>We could include 15 randomised clinical trials with 1714 patients. We found no significant effects of colchicine versus placebo/no intervention on mortality (relative risks (RR) 1.00, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.87 to 1.16), liver-related mortality (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.33), complications (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.38), liver biochemistry, liver histology, or alcohol consumption (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.39). Colchicine was associated with a significantly increased risk of serious adverse events (RR 8.38, 95% CI 1.08 to 65,2) and non-serious adverse events (RR 4.35, 95% CI 2.16 to 8.77). </P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>Colchicine should not be used for alcoholic, viral, or cryptogenic liver fibrosis or liver cirrhosis outside randomised clinical trials. </P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2008-10-17 14:22:27 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="dimitrinka nikolova">
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Liver fibrosis and liver cirrhosis are common reactions to hepatotoxic substances, hepatotropic viruses, autoimmune liver diseases, metabolic liver diseases, etc. Alcohol and hepatotropic viruses cause the majority of liver fibrosis and cirrhosis in the Western World. The attributable risk for symptomatic liver cirrhosis in Italy explained by alcohol consumption, hepatitis B virus, and hepatitis C virus was 98.1% in men and 67.0% in women (<LINK REF="REF-Corrao-1998a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Corrao 1998a</LINK>). These figures resemble those found in many other western countries.</P>
<P>Alcohol leads to fatty liver (<LINK REF="REF-Rubin-1968" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rubin 1968</LINK>) and alcoholic hepatitis, fibrosis, and cirrhosis (<LINK REF="REF-Morgan-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morgan 1999</LINK>). Alcoholic hepatitis is associated with peripheral leukocytosis and marked hepatic portal and parenchymal inflammatory infiltration predominantly by neutrophils (<LINK REF="REF-Hill-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hill 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sheron-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sheron 1993</LINK>). Alcoholic hepatitis is a predictor of liver fibrosis and cirrhosis (<LINK REF="REF-S_x00f8_rensen-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sørensen 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Marbet-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marbet 1987</LINK>). About 70% of patients with clinical alcoholic hepatitis also have alcoholic cirrhosis at the time of diagnosis (<LINK REF="REF-Mendenhall-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mendenhall 1984</LINK>). Five year survival rates in patients with alcoholic cirrhosis who stop drinking are of order of 50% to 75%; whereas survival rates in patients continuing to drink rarely exceed 40% (<LINK REF="REF-Powell-1968" TYPE="REFERENCE">Powell 1968</LINK>). The progression of liver fibrosis and cirrhosis in alcoholics is enhanced by the presence of hepatitis C and hepatitis B virus markers (<LINK REF="REF-Chang-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chang 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Corrao-1998b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Corrao 1998b</LINK>).</P>
<P>Hepatitis B and hepatitis C viruses lead to viral hepatitis. In patients with chronic hepatitis the number of patients with cirrhosis is increasing over the years (<LINK REF="REF-Imperial-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Imperial 1999</LINK>). Several studies have demonstrated that the risk of fibrotic progression of chronic hepatitis C is significantly enhanced by alcohol consumption (<LINK REF="REF-Poynard-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Poynard 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wiley-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wiley 1998</LINK>). Liver histology of chronic hepatitis C in patients with chronic alcoholism may be indistinguishable from hepatitis C in non-alcoholic patients (<LINK REF="REF-Schiff-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schiff 1997</LINK>). Alcohol consumption may also speed the development of hepatitis B cirrhosis (<LINK REF="REF-Chevilotte-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chevilotte 1983</LINK>).<BR/> <BR/>Colchicine is a plant alkaloid. It is effective against gouty arthritis and other forms of rheumatic diseases (rheumatoid arthritis, familial Mediterranean fever, Bechet´s disease, etc) (<LINK REF="REF-Ben_x002d_Chetrit-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ben-Chetrit 1998</LINK>). Colchicine inhibits the migration of granulocytes into the inflamed area and inhibits the metabolic and phagocytic activity of granulocytes. Further, colchicine is anti-mitotic (<LINK REF="REF-Shi-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shi 1998</LINK>) and anti-fibrotic. Colchicine retards the microtubule-mediated transport of procollagen (<LINK REF="REF-Ehrlich-1972" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ehrlich 1972</LINK>) and enhances collagenase activity (<LINK REF="REF-Harris-1971" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harris 1971</LINK>). Colchicine decreased liver fibrosis in rats with carbon tetrachloride induced cirrhosis (<LINK REF="REF-Rojkind-1975" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rojkind 1975</LINK>).</P>
<P>Several randomised clinical trials have addressed the question whether colchicine has any efficacy in patients with alcoholic or non-alcoholic fibrosis and cirrhosis. The results have largely been negative (<LINK REF="REF-Trinchet-1989a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Trinchet 1989a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Akriviadis-1990a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Akriviadis 1990a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Colman-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Colman 1998</LINK>), although some studies found efficacy of colchicine on mortality (<LINK REF="STD-Kershenobich-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Kershenobich 1988</LINK>). Based on a questionnaire survey among European hospital-based specialists in gastroenterology/hepatology, 8% to 35% of the specialists considered using colchicine for alcoholic hepatitis, fibrosis, or cirrhosis (<LINK REF="REF-Gluud-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gluud 1993</LINK>). </P>
<P>The present systematic review examines the beneficial and harmful effects of colchicine for alcoholic or non-alcoholic (viral or cryptogenic) fibrosis and cirrhosis. Although alcoholic and viral induced liver fibrosis/cirrhosis have differing pathogenic mechanisms, these conditions often coexist and potentiate the development of fibrosis/cirrhosis. Primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) (<LINK REF="REF-Warnes-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Warnes 1991</LINK>) was not included as this disease has another pathogenic mechanisms and seldom coexist with alcoholic or non-alcoholic fibrosis or cirrhosis. Furthermore, the effects of colchicine in patients with PBC have been assessed in another Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-Gong-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gong 2004</LINK>). We have been unable to identify other meta-analyses or systematic reviews on the topic.</P>

</CRIT_OUTCOMES>
</SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<SEARCH_METHODS MODIFIED="2008-10-17 14:20:57 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="dimitrinka nikolova">
<P>Searches in <I>The Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register</I> (September 2004), <I>The Cochrane Controlled Trials Register </I>(Issue 3 2004), <I>MEDLINE</I> (1966 to September 2004), <I>EMBASE</I> (1974 to September 2004), and <I>Web of Science</I> (http://isi3.isiknowledge.com/portal.cgi from 1945 to September 2004) were done using the search strategies specified in <LINK REF="APP-01" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 1</LINK> and <LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK>.</P>
<P>Further trials were sought by reading the reference lists of the identified studies.</P>
<P>We sent letters to the principal authors of the identified randomised clinical trials and the pharmaceutical companies producing colchicine asking for information on additional trials.</P>
</SEARCH_METHODS>
<DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>The review was conducted according to this protocol following the recommendations given by The Cochrane Collaboration (<LINK REF="REF-Alderson-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alderson 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<B>Selection of trials for inclusion and data extraction</B>
<BR/>The two authors independently selected the trials to be included in the review following the selection criteria. The authors planned to confer with an 'ombudsman' in case disagreements could not be solved. Such cases did not occur. </P>
<P>
<B>Patient characteristics, diagnosis, and treatments</B>
<BR/>The following was recorded from the randomised clinical trials: mean (or median) age, sex ratio, alcohol consumption, form of liver disease, etiology (acute viral hepatitis B or C; chronic viral hepatitis B or C; alcoholic liver disease (alcoholic steatosis; alcoholic hepatitis; alcoholic fibrosis; alcoholic cirrhosis; mixed), duration of liver disease, severity of liver disease at entry, type and dose of colchicine intervention (route of administration, formulation, frequency, and duration of dosing), and type of intervention in the control group. The diagnostic work-up before entry was registered, specifically if hepatitis markers were evaluated and which type of fibrosis/cirrhosis patients were excluded from the randomised clinical trials. Development of clinical symptoms and complications, liver biochemistry, liver fibrosis markers, liver biopsy findings, alcohol consumption, quality-of-life, health economics (that is, length of hospital stay, cost of medication, and cost of additional follow-up weighted against any gains in health) and adverse events during follow-up were registered.</P>
<P>
<B>Assessment of methodological quality</B>
<BR/>The methodological quality of the randomised clinical trials was assessed using generation of allocation sequence, allocation concealment, blinding, and withdrawals and dropouts (<LINK REF="REF-Moher-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kjaergard-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kjaergard 2001</LINK>). </P>
<P>
<B>
<I>Generation of the allocation sequence</I>
</B>
<BR/>The procedure used to create a random sequence ensuring that each participant has a known, unpredictable, and usually equal chance of being assigned to intervention groups. The allocation sequence generation can be classified as<BR/>(1) Adequate, if the allocation sequence was generated by a computer or random number table. Drawing of lots, tossing of a coin, shuffling of cards, or throwing dice may also be considered as adequate if a person who was not otherwise involved in the recruitment of participants performed the procedure.<BR/>(2) Unclear,<I> </I>if the trial was described as randomised, but the method used for the allocation sequence generation was not described.<BR/>(3) Inadequate, if a system involving dates, names, or admittance numbers were used for the allocation of patients. Such studies are known as quasi-randomised studies and should usually be excluded from systematic reviews because they are associated with a considerable risk of bias.</P>
<P>
<B>
<I>Allocation concealment </I>
</B>
<BR/>The procedure used to conceal the allocation sequence from the investigators who assign participants to the intervention groups. The allocation concealment can be classified as<BR/>(1) Adequate, if the allocation of patients involved a central independent unit, on-site locked computer, identically appearing numbered drug bottles or containers prepared by an independent pharmacist or investigator, or sealed envelopes. Envelopes should be serially numbered, sealed, and opaque. However, this information is rarely provided, indicating an increased risk of bias. In that case, sealed envelopes may constitute an intermediate category between adequate and unclear.<BR/>(2) Unclear, if the trial was described as randomised, but the method used to conceal the allocation was not described.<BR/>(3) Inadequate, if the allocation sequence was known to the investigators who assigned participants. </P>
<P>
<B>
<I>Blinding </I>
</B>
<BR/>Blinding was classified as<BR/>(1) Adequate, if the trial was described as double blind and the method of blinding involved identical placebo and active drugs.<BR/>(2) Unclear, if the trial was described as double blind, but the method of blinding was not described.<BR/>(3) Not performed, if the trial was not double blind. We also included single blind trials in this category.</P>
<P>
<B>
<I>Follow-up</I>
</B>
<BR/>The reported follow-up was classified as<BR/>(1) Adequate, if the numbers and reasons for dropouts and withdrawals in all intervention groups were described or if it was specified that there were no dropouts or withdrawals.<BR/>(2) Unclear, if the report gave the impression that there had been no dropouts or withdrawals, but this was not specifically stated.<BR/>(3) Inadequate, if the number or reasons for dropouts and withdrawals were not described.</P>
<P>
<B>
<I>Intention-to-treat analysis </I>
</B>
<BR/>We registered whether the randomised clinical trial reported or not on the use of intention-to-treat analysis.</P>
<P>Data on the number of patients with each outcome event by allocated treatment group, irrespective of compliance of follow-up, were sought to allow an intention-to-treat analysis. If the above data were not available in the trial reports, further information was sought by correspondence with the investigators.<BR/>
<B>
<BR/>Statistical methods</B>
<BR/>All analyses were performed according to the intention-to-treat method; that is, all randomised patients were included. We conducted analyses counting outcomes as reported in the individual trials. Further, for patients without clear description of the outcome on mortality, we conducted a 'worst-case scenario' analysis considering patients dropped out or withdrawn because of death.<BR/>The statistical package (RevMan Analyses) provided by The Cochrane Collaboration was used. We analysed our data with both the fixed effect model and the random effects model. In case the models differed regarding significance (P &lt; 0.05), we reported both. If the random effects model was used, it is stated in the text. Otherwise, the fixed effect model was reported. </P>
<P>Dichotomous data were analysed by calculating the relative risk (RR) and continuous outcomes as weighed mean difference (WMD), both with 95% confidence intervals (CI).</P>
<P>
<B>Heterogeneity and funnel plot asymmetry</B>
<BR/>Heterogeneity in the results of the trials was initially assessed by inspection of graphical presentations and by calculating a test of heterogeneity (Chi-square and I<SUP>2</SUP>). Potential causes for heterogeneity (such as etiology of fibrosis/cirrhosis, stage of liver disease, dose and duration of treatment) were explored by performing sensitivity analyses. We performed subgroup analyses according to the adequacy of methodological components (<LINK REF="REF-Moher-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kjaergard-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kjaergard 2001</LINK>). </P>
<P>Due to the risk of chance findings, statistical findings among the secondary outcome measures were interpreted conservatively.</P>
<P>Funnel plots to identify publication bias and other biases were analysed by measure of regression analyses (<LINK REF="REF-Egger-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Egger 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vickers-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vickers 1998</LINK>).</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>We did not find any significant effect of colchicine on any clinically meaningful outcomes (mortality, liver-related mortality, liver complications, liver biochemistry, and liver histology) of patients with alcoholic, viral, and cryptogenic liver fibrosis or cirrhosis. Further, colchicine was associated with a significant increase of both severe and non-severe adverse events. </P>
<P>In the group of randomised trials including patients with mixed aetiologies the trial of <LINK REF="STD-Kershenobich-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Kershenobich 1988</LINK> et al showed a tendency of colchicine to decrease mortality. However, there are a number of things that may contest this observation. First, sensitivity analysis comparing intervention efficacy of colchicine on mortality by contrasting trials of less than 18 months of treatment with those of at least 18 months, did not reveal any significant effect of treatment duration. Accordingly, treatment duration may not be the explanation of the favourable effect observed by <LINK REF="STD-Kershenobich-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Kershenobich 1988</LINK> et al. Second, the data of <LINK REF="STD-Kershenobich-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Kershenobich 1988</LINK> et al are also contrasted by the absence of any significant therapeutic efficacy of colchicine in the groups of randomised clinical trials including single aetiologies - alcohol, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C. These are the likely aetiologies of the patients entered into the <LINK REF="STD-Kershenobich-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Kershenobich 1988</LINK> et al trial. Third, we were unable to detect any significant influence of colchicine on a number of clinical outcomes, liver histology, or liver biochemistry. Fourth, both the size and the methodological quality of the <LINK REF="STD-Kershenobich-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Kershenobich 1988</LINK> et al trial opens for both random and systematic errors. Fifth, and most importantly, colchicine was without significant effect on mortality in the pooled analysis of all trials. Further supporting the lack of significant effect of colchicine on mortality are the findings in liver patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (<LINK REF="REF-Gong-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gong 2004</LINK>). Colchicine for patients with primary biliary cirrhosis was associated with a RR = 1.2 (95% CI 0.71 to 2.06) when compared with placebo/no intervention (<LINK REF="REF-Gong-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gong 2004</LINK>). Sixth, the positive effect of colchicine on the mortality of cirrhotic patients of mixed aetiologies observed by <LINK REF="STD-Kershenobich-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Kershenobich 1988</LINK> et al may be due to an uneven distribution of the aetiologies in the colchicine and placebo groups. The different aetiologies were not evenly distributed between the colchicine and the placebo arm (alcoholic 44% versus 46%; posthepatitic 46% versus 35%; other etiologies 9% versus 20%). On the other hand, the <LINK REF="STD-Kershenobich-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Kershenobich 1988</LINK> et al trial was the trial treating patients for the longest duration, that is, for almost five years. Their positive findings are weakly supported by the observations of a trend toward reduced mortality in the worst-case scenario analyses and a significantly reduced mortality in the colchicine group of a quasi-randomised trial (<LINK REF="STD-Adhami-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Adhami 1998</LINK>). This study was excluded from this systematic review due to the quasi-randomisation, which may introduce bias.</P>
<P>Colchicine had a significant positive effect on two out of four serum markers of fibrotic activity (7S collagen and prolidase), but was without a significant effect on collagen-peptidase. The fibrotic markers were evaluated in four randomised trials including few patients. The contrasting results do not provide any evidence for concluding that colchicine may have a beneficial effect on liver fibrosis or cirrhosis, especially considering that colchicine was without any significant effect on liver histology and portal pressure. Furthermore, due to the large number of statistical comparisons having been performed it is not surprising that some of the comparisons may have come out with a significant difference simply due to 'mass significance' (that is, spurious significant findings due to repetitive testing).</P>
<P>The lack of a significant effect of colchicine on a number of outcome variables does not appear to be confounded by an uneven distribution of alcohol consumption as the proportion of patients continuing to misuse alcohol did not differ significantly between the colchicine and the control arms of the randomised trials reporting on alcohol consumption during follow-up. </P>
<P>We found that colchicine intervention is associated with a significant increase in non-serious adverse events and serious adverse events. We were not able to identify data on the effects of colchicine on quality of life and health economics.</P>
<P>It is impossible to demonstrate that any intervention is without an effect. From inspection of the confidence intervals found in this review, colchicine may still favourably affect mortality of patients with chronic hepatitis B, chronic hepatitis C, and liver fibrosis/cirrhosis of mixed etiologies with about 40% to 50%. In patients with alcoholic liver disease the likelihood of a positive effect seems more remote, but could in fact amount to a reduction of mortality. On the other hand, colchicine could also increase the mortality. As demonstrated in this review colchicine does increase the risk of serious and non-serious adverse events. Therefore, colchicine ought not to be used outside randomised clinical trials and if such trials are planned, they need to involve a close monitoring of benefits as well as harms. Due to the trend towards a negative effect of colchicine for alcoholic fibrosis/cirrhosis, new randomised clinical trials in this patient group should await the reporting of the three ongoing randomised clinical trials (<LINK REF="STD-Bui-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Bui 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Collins-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Collins 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Floreani-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Floreani 2001</LINK>).</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>We did not find any significant effect of colchicine on any clinically meaningful outcomes (mortality, liver-related mortality, liver complications, liver biochemistry, and liver histology) of patients with alcoholic, viral, and cryptogenic liver fibrosis or cirrhosis. Further, colchicine was associated with a significant increase of both severe and non-severe adverse events. Accordingly, there is no evidence for using colchicine for liver fibrosis/cirrhosis at present.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>The absence of evidence for an effect of colchicine on clinically relevant outcomes, however, does not mean that there is evidence of absence of effect. If researchers wish to conduct new randomised trials they ought to be large and the treatment period ought to be several years and the benefits as well as harms need to be closely monitored. Further, patients with alcoholic liver disease should not be included in such trials before the results of ongoing randomised trials have been analysed and published. All trials ought to be conducted and reported in accordance with the CONSORT statement (www.consort-statement.org). Colchicine should not be used as a control intervention in randomised trials before it has been established that it has beneficial effect and before detrimental effects can be excluded.</P>
