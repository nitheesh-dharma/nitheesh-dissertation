<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2012-09-19 09:04:54 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Aortic dissection is a potentially life-threatening condition that occurs when a tear in the inner lining of the aorta (usually in the chest portion of the artery) causes bleeding between the inner and outer layers of the wall of the aorta. The layers become separated (or dissected) creating a false channel for blood to flow. It is the most common emergency affecting the aorta. Symptoms include sudden, severe, sharp chest pain that spreads to the neck or down the back, sudden difficulty speaking, a weak pulse and loss of consciousness. Aortic dissections typically occur in adults aged between 60 and 70 years, with more males than females. The main cause is thought to be high blood pressure. An aortic dissection is classified depending on where it begins in the aorta and if it is acute or chronic. Acute dissections are diagnosed within 14 days after the first symptoms appear; while chronic ones are diagnosed after 14 days. This review looked at chronic type B dissections, which begin in the descending part of the aorta (the section of the artery that moves down through the chest and abdomen). Patients with this type of aortic dissection have traditionally been treated with blood pressure lowering medications, with good short-term results (annual survival in excess of 80%). They have, however, increased long-term mortality. In the long term, medical treatment alone may put some patients at risk of serious complications such as progressive aortic enlargement, poor blood flow to some organs or the extremities, and aortic rupture. Patients with these life-threatening complications require urgent treatment of the dissected aorta by open surgery or, more recently, endovascular thoracic aortic stent grafting (TEVAR). TEVAR reduces the number of early deaths compared with open surgical treatment.</P>
<P>For people with chronic uncomplicated aortic dissection, there is uncertainty about whether stent grafting in addition to best medical therapy improves patient outcomes. This review identified a single trial that randomised 140 patients with uncomplicated chronic type B aortic dissection to medical treatment alone or medical treatment plus stenting. The trial was methodologically sound but did not show a meaningful difference in two-year survival between the two treatment options. The number of deaths observed in the trial did not meet the number expected from registry data, so the trial was underpowered for that end point. Longer-term data from the trial are awaited. Over 20% of the patients initially randomised to the optimal medical care group 'crossed over' to receive TEVAR or open surgery because of the degree of expansion of the aorta with medical therapy alone.</P>

<P>A single trial was identified that fulfilled the inclusion criteria (INSTEAD trial). The two-year all cause survival was not statistically significantly different between study groups (95.6% ± 2.5% in the optimised medical therapy (OMT) group and 88.9% ± 3.7% in the thoracic endovascular aneurysm repair (TEVAR) + OMT group; log rank test P = 0.15).</P>

<P>Overall, the data at two years were insufficient to make any practice recommendations. However, the data on the anatomic remodeling of dissected aortas observed after TEVAR + OMT is encouraging and future studies should follow up cases for at least five years to see if early endovascular interventions, even in stable initially uncomplicated type B patients, are of long-term benefit.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2012-09-18 12:41:58 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2012-09-18 09:16:58 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Aortic dissection is defined as a progressive splitting of the inner layer of the aorta. It starts as an intimal tear in the aorta that acts as an entry point for blood flow allowing blood to leak into the middle layer of the aorta (media), which leads to propagation of a subintimal channel. This results in a dissection of the aortic wall and the formation of true and false aortic channels that can reduce blood flow to the major arteries arising from the aorta. The false channel progresses distally (situated farthest away) and frequently re-connects with the true lumen via a re-entry tear. The causes of death include organ failure and peripheral ischaemia (poor or no blood supply to the limbs) from peripheral vascular complications. According to the Stanford classification (<LINK REF="REF-Stanford-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stanford 2006</LINK>), type B aortic dissection involves the descending aorta and the entry point of the dissection is distal to the left subclavian artery. This is equivalent to DeBakey type III aortic dissection (<LINK REF="REF-DeBakey-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">DeBakey 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>Originally, type B dissections were characterised as acute (defined as symptom onset of 14 days or less) or chronic (those that have existed more than 14 days). More recently, type B dissections are also stratified as 'complicated' or 'uncomplicated'; where features of complicated dissection include rupture, defined as haemorrhage outside the aortic wall, or malperfusion, defined as visceral, renal, lower extremity or spinal cord hypoperfusion (<LINK REF="REF-White-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">White 2011</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2012-09-18 09:29:18 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Traditionally, uncomplicated chronic (also known as silent or stable) type B aortic dissections are treated medically with anti-hypertensive therapy, which is associated with a relatively good short-term prognosis (annual survival in excess of 80%). However, the long-term outcomes offered by such conservative management alone are suboptimal due to either delayed expansion of the false lumen, which predisposes patients to aortic rupture, or retrograde progression of the dissection with involvement of the proximal aorta resulting in increased mortality in up to 50% of patients at five years (<LINK REF="REF-Nienaber-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nienaber 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>Type B aortic dissections require intervention when they are complicated by rupture, impending rupture, rapid dilatation, malperfusion or uncontrollable pain. Despite advances in surgical techniques and the post-operative management, open thoraco-aortic replacement surgery still carries considerable risk of morbidity and mortality.</P>
<P>With the advance of imaging and endovascular techniques, a thoracic stent graft can be placed inside the aorta to cover the primary intimal tear, thus redirecting flow into the true lumen and promoting depressurisation and thrombosis of the false lumen. The desired outcome is to eventually remodel the dissected aorta. The implantation of the stent may also enlarge the compressed true lumen, resulting in aortic stability in just a few months<B> </B>(<LINK REF="REF-Nienaber-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nienaber 1999</LINK>). Thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) of acute complicated type B dissections has been shown to offer substantial early mortality advantage over open surgical treatment in the short and mid-term and, despite recognising the need for further evidence on morbidity and long-term durability, thoracic endografting procedures are now routinely used (<LINK REF="REF-Shu-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shu 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Steuer-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Steuer 2011</LINK>). In the management of chronic or subacute (between two and six weeks after the onset of dissection) dissections, however, there is ongoing debate over the role of stent grafts.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2012-09-18 12:41:58 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>It has long been established that while thrombosis of the false lumen results in a better long-term prognosis (<LINK REF="REF-Erbel-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Erbel 1993</LINK>), persistent perfusion of the false lumen is associated with progressive aortic dilatation and a poor long-term outcome (<LINK REF="REF-Bernard-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bernard 2001</LINK>). Based on these observations, elective stent-graft placement in patients with stable aortic disease presents an attractive prophylactic option against best medical therapy only, as sealing the proximal entry tear by the stent-graft will facilitate thrombosis of the false lumen eventually leading to non-surgical aortic re-modeling. It is hoped that intervention in the uncomplicated chronic stage might have a beneficial impact on longer-term outcomes, particularly in light of the lower risk profile of TEVAR in stable patients with chronic dissection compared to those with acute dissection (<LINK REF="REF-Eggebrecht-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eggebrecht 2006</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2012-09-18 09:55:20 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The optimal treatment strategy for patients with uncomplicated chronic type B dissection remains controversial. This review looked into the current data on the management of uncomplicated chronic type B aortic dissection with medical treatment alone versus medical treatment and stenting. Given the poor long-term outcomes of medical therapy alone, it is crucial to elucidate whether endovascular stenting in conjunction with medical therapy can offer improved outcomes in the chronic phase.</P>

<P>The INvestigation of STEnt Grafts in Aortic Dissection (INSTEAD) trial is described below in the table <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>. The INSTEAD study represents the first prospective randomised, controlled trial to investigate the outcome of elective stent-graft placement in survivors of uncomplicated chronic type B aortic dissection. This multi-centre trial (seven centres in Germany, Italy and France) enrolled consecutive patients older than 18 years with stable type B aortic dissection after 14 days of the index type B aortic dissection (to identify early complications and exclude spontaneous false lumen thrombosis). Those who had traditional indications for endovascular or open surgery (diameter 6 cm) or acute complications were excluded. Patients were randomised in a 1:1 ratio to either optimal medical therapy (OMT) only, including tight blood pressure control (arterial pressure according to World Health Organization guidelines: &lt; 120/80 mmHg), close surveillance and recurrent computed tomography imaging (n = 68), or to elective stent-graft placement plus optimal medical therapy (OMT + TEVAR) (n = 72). Sample size was estimated in the protocol based on the assumption of a 30% mortality rate for type B aortic dissections. A total enrolment of 140 patients was planned, which was achieved after evaluating 597 patients. Patients were followed for a mean period of two years.</P>

<P>The study carried out by <LINK REF="STD-Duda-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Duda 2002</LINK> evaluated the feasibility of endovascular stent grafting in thoracic aortic pathologies in 16 patients (five type B dissections, five contained ruptures, three aneurysms of the descending aorta, one thoraco-abdominal aneurysm, one mural thrombosis, one patch aneurysm) over a three-year period. This small prospective study was successful in showing thoracic endovascular stent grafting as a safe alternative to open surgery with good short to mid-term outcomes. However, this study was excluded due to lack of randomisation and lack of controls. Two other trials (<LINK REF="STD-ADSORB-trial" TYPE="STUDY">ADSORB trial</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chemelli_x002d_Steingruber-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Chemelli-Steingruber 2010</LINK>) were excluded because they included patients with acute type B dissection.</P>

<P>Patients were enrolled in the trial over a very wide time frame after their index dissection (between two and 52 weeks), which raises the issue of patients having very different pathologies depending on whether they were enrolled two weeks into the course of their aortic dissections or in the latter part of the trial (<LINK REF="REF-Kwolek-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kwolek 2009</LINK>). However, the median time between onset of dissection and randomisation was 45 days in the OMT group versus 39 days in the OMT + TEVAR group, with nearly identical time intervals.

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2012-09-18 12:48:33 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Karen Welch">
<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-09-18 12:45:47 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Marlene Stewart">
<P>TEVAR has been demonstrated to be a life-saving alternative in the management of patients with acute onset complicated type B aortic dissections. At present it has a limited role in the setting of clinically stable, so-called uncomplicated cases for whom aggressive medical therapy allows a two-year survival rate of between 65% and 75% (<LINK REF="REF-Tsai-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tsai 2006</LINK>). However, given that the long-term survival with medical therapy can be &lt; 50%, there is a need to understand the appropriate role of TEVAR as a viable adjunct treatment concept in the treatment of chronic uncomplicated type B aortic dissections.</P>
<P>In the first randomised controlled trial comparing thoracic endovascular aneurysm repair (TEVAR) plus optimised medical therapy (OMT) with OMT alone (<LINK REF="STD-INSTEAD-trial" TYPE="STUDY">INSTEAD trial</LINK>), there were no differences in all cause deaths. At two years, the cumulative survival probability was 95.6% ± 2.5% in the OMT group and 88.9% ± 3.7% in the OMT + TEVAR group (P = 0.15). In total only 11 fatalities were observed, not meeting the expected two-year death rate of 28, hence the trial turned out to be underpowered for that end point. Similarly, there were no statistically significant differences in aorta-related deaths due to aortic rupture or dissection progression plus rupture. The aorta-related two-year survival was 97% ± 2.0% with OMT only and 94.4% ± 2.7% with OMT + TEVAR (P = 0.44). The lower than expected mortality rates in both groups, especially in the OMT group, were surprising. This might be 'trial effect', as the management of patients in the OMT was optimised with regular patient visits and imaging, excellent blood pressure adjustment and tight surveillance as part of the trial follow-up protocol. Furthermore, there were four neurological adverse events in the OMT + TEVAR group, one paraplegia, two stroke, and one transient paraparesis, and one paraparesis in the OMT group.</P>
<P>Over 20% of the patients initially randomised to the OMT group 'crossed over' after medical therapy alone was insufficient to prevent their aorta from expanding by over 60 mm. Of the 68 patients in the OMT group, 16.2% crossed over to OMT + TEVAR with uneventful outcomes, plus another three patients (4.4%) required open surgery during the study. A total of 91.3% of patients in the TEVAR group showed aortic remodeling with true aortic lumen recovery and false lumen thrombosis compared with only 19.4% in the OMT group, including crossovers (P &lt; 0.001). This suggests that the evolution of aortic remodeling was different and TEVAR may show a survival benefit over OMT alone with a longer follow-up. Nevertheless, longer surveillance is crucial to prove the effect of positive aortic remodeling on survival.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2012-09-18 12:46:52 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Marlene Stewart">
<P>Overall, the data at two years are insufficient to make any practice recommendations. However, the data on the anatomic remodeling of dissected aortas observed after TEVAR are encouraging and should be monitored for at least five years to see if early endovascular interventions, even in stable initially uncomplicated type B patients, are of long-term benefit. The single included trial recruited exclusively within Europe, so potentially these data may not represent a global picture.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2012-09-18 12:47:34 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Marlene Stewart">
<P>As only 40% of the expected events occurred within two years (based on registry data), the trial turned out to be underpowered for all cause mortality (<LINK REF="REF-Nienaber-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nienaber 2011</LINK>). Methodological quality appears sound, with good randomisation, clear presentation of all data and of statistical methods.</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2012-09-18 12:47:51 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Karen Welch">
<P>Two authors (PU, JM) independently selected the studies included (<LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>) and abstracted the data, which were cross-checked by the other authors (GS, JP). Strengths of the present review regarding potential biases are: 1) all relevant studies were identified and included in the review; 2) relevant data for all studies were obtained; and 3) the main outcome of the study included is the outcome of interest for this review. The review authors were not involved in the included or excluded trials.</P>
</POTENTIAL_BIASES>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2012-09-18 12:48:33 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Marlene Stewart">
<P>A single review of endovascular repair of chronic type B dissection broadly agrees with the conclusions of our review, stating that further data were needed to reach a conclusion on best treatment for this condition (<LINK REF="REF-Thrumurthy-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thrumurthy 2011</LINK>). The authors included non-randomised trial data, but still showed no significant benefit for TEVAR over OMT.</P>
<P>A non-randomised, controlled study of thoracic endografting for multiple pathologies (<LINK REF="STD-Duda-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Duda 2002</LINK>) showed that TEVAR was feasible and safe in the medium term, and showed similar mortality and complication rates as the single included study in this Cochrane review.</P>

<P>Given that patients with uncomplicated chronic type B dissection who are managed with the use of anti-hypertensive agents only are at risk of developing complications, it is probable that there is a subset of these patients for whom early stent-graft placement is justified. However, at present there are no reliable or proven parameters to help identify these patients.</P>
<P>Based on current evidence, prophylactic or early stenting in patients with uncomplicated chronic type B dissection does not have any survival benefits at two years and best medical treatment with close surveillance appears to be a reasonable option. Ongoing (unpublished) trial data at five years may influence practice.</P>

<P>There is a need for further randomised trials with adequate sample size to ascertain the role of early TEVAR in patient with chronic uncomplicated type B dissection.

<DESCRIPTION>
<P>
<B>Issue 1</B>: "The trial was initiated with an assumption of a late death rate of up to 30% in type B dissections", where 28 deaths were expected for adequate power (only 11 were observed), thus making the trial underpowered to evaluate the mortality end point.</P>
<P>
<B>Issue 2</B>: "Analysis of individual fatalities (n = 11; (4 OMT alone) + (7 OMT + TEVAR)) revealed that 4 patients had been included despite protocol violation; with acute malperfusion in 1 case after dissection-related renal dysfunction on dialysis, 2 cases with acute leg ischaemia, and 1 case with ongoing pain and extra-aortic blood collection since onset of dissection, none of these 4 patients should have entered the study"</P>
<P>"The inclusion of these patients is problematic because if these four deaths (from OMT + TEVAR group) are eliminated from the analysis, then no aortic-related deaths were associated with the OMT + TEVAR group."</P>
<P>
<B>Issue 3</B>: Patients were enrolled in the trial over a very wide time frame after their index dissection (between 2 and 52 weeks), which raises the issue of patients having very different pathologies depending on whether they were enrolled two weeks into the course of their aortic dissections or in the latter part of the trial. However, the median time between onset of dissection and randomisation was 45 days in the OMT group versus 39 days in the OMT + TEVAR group, with nearly identical time intervals. Therefore, stratification of patients into different time periods is unlikely to produce different results.</P>
