Twenty new trials with 2780 participants had been completed since the previous review. Outcome data were available for up to 22 trials (2865 participants) that compared acupuncture with any control (open control or sham acupuncture) but for only six trials (668 participants) that compared acupuncture with sham acupuncture control. We downgraded the evidence to low or very low quality because of risk of bias in included studies, inconsistency in the acupuncture intervention and outcome measures, and imprecision in effect estimates.</P><P>When compared with any control (11 trials with 1582 participants), findings of lower odds of death or dependency at the end of follow-up and over the long term (&#8805; three months) in the acupuncture group were uncertain (odds ratio [OR] 0.61, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.46 to 0.79; very low-quality evidence; and OR 0.67, 95% CI 0.53 to 0.85; eight trials with 1436 participants; very low-quality evidence, respectively) and were not confirmed by trials comparing acupuncture with sham acupuncture (OR 0.71, 95% CI 0.43 to 1.18; low-quality evidence; and OR 0.67, 95% CI 0.40 to 1.12; low-quality evidence, respectively).</P><P>In trials comparing acupuncture with any control, findings that acupuncture was associated with increases in the global neurological deficit score and in the motor function score were uncertain (standardized mean difference [SMD] 0.84, 95% CI 0.36 to 1.32; 12 trials with 1086 participants; very low-quality evidence; and SMD 1.08, 95% CI 0.45 to 1.71; 11 trials with 895 participants; very low-quality evidence).

Trials should clearly report the method of randomization, concealment of allocation, and whether blinding of participants, personnel, and outcome assessors was achieved, while paying close attention to the effects of acupuncture on long-term functional outcomes.</P></ABS_CONCLUSIONS></ABSTRACT><BODY MODIFIED="2018-03-22 16:11:36 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2018-03-01 04:15:24 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>This review is the first update of a previously published review (<LINK REF="REF-Zhang-2005b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhang 2005b</LINK>).</P><CONDITION MODIFIED="2018-03-01 03:38:15 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Stroke is a devastating disease with high morbidity and mortality.

Investigators provided no evidence of a difference for other trial outcomes.

One systematic review investigated the effects of long-term "Xingnao Kaiqiao needling" in people with ischemic stroke (<LINK REF="REF-Yang-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yang 2015</LINK>). We included two trials with 126 participants in the meta-analyses on disability, results of which indicated that "Xingnao Kaiqiao needling" could reduce the poststroke disability rate, which is consistent with the findings of our review. Another systematic review investigated the effect of acupuncture for the outcome of death or dependency (<LINK REF="REF-Zheng-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zheng 2011</LINK>), whereas no trial in this review reported this outcome. A third systematic review, which included patients with stroke in both the acute and the non-acute stage, demonstrated the efficacy of acupuncture in poststroke rehabilitation, whereas review authors did not report the effects of acupuncture on ADL and in the acute stage alone (<LINK REF="REF-Wu-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wu 2010</LINK>).</P><P>Three systematic reviews evaluated scalp acupuncture for people with acute ischemic stroke (<LINK REF="REF-Wang-2012b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wang 2012b</LINK>), acute hypertensive intracerebral hemorrhage (<LINK REF="REF-Zheng-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zheng 2011</LINK>), or stroke (<LINK REF="REF-Bai-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bai 2015</LINK>). All three reviews drew similar conclusions that scalp acupuncture was useful in improving neurological deficits. Six trials included in one review focused on the effect of scalp acupuncture on neurological deficit scores in acute ischemic stroke (<LINK REF="REF-Wang-2012b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wang 2012b</LINK>); only one trial stated the method of randomization, and no trial reported allocation concealment or the blinding procedure. Furthermore, selective reporting bias might be present in the RCTs included in this review, characterized as co-intervention reported and similarity of baseline (<LINK REF="REF-Wang-2012b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wang 2012b</LINK>). In <LINK REF="REF-Bai-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bai 2015</LINK>, data on changes in neurological deficit score and motor function were available, and this trial did not report the method of randomization, allocation concealment, or the blinding procedure. Thus the results of these two reviews should be interpreted with caution because the included trials were of low quality (<LINK REF="REF-Bai-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bai 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wang-2012b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wang 2012b</LINK>). In the review of acupuncture for acute intracerebral hemorrhage (<LINK REF="REF-Zheng-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zheng 2011</LINK>), investigators assessed neurological deficit improvement by using the rate of reduction in neurological deficit scores at baseline rather than changes in neurological deficit score as used in the present review.</P><P>Two systematic reviews that investigated sham-controlled RCTs found no positive effect of acupuncture on functional recovery after stroke (<LINK REF="REF-Kong-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kong 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wu-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wu 2010</LINK>), which was consistent with findings of the subgroup analysis reported in the present review. However, we do not think that sham acupuncture as the control is necessary in a pragmatic trial because sham acupuncture may have an underlying physiological effect (<LINK REF="REF-Bao-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bao 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moffet-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moffet 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zhang-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Zhang 2015</LINK>).</P></AGREEMENT></DISCUSSION><CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2018-03-01 04:10:35 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2018-03-01 04:09:31 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>In this review, the apparent reduction in dependency and improvement in neurological recovery with acupuncture in acute stroke are confounded by risk of bias related to use of open controls. Adverse events with acupuncture were generally reported to be minor and usually did not result in stopping treatment.</P></IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE><IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2018-03-01 04:10:35 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Among the 33 included trials, only 18 reported information about randomization and 12 reported blinding. Future studies, with larger sample sizes, clear information on methods of randomization and concealment of allocation, and statements on whether participants, personnel, and outcome assessors were blinded, are required to assess the effects and safety of acupuncture. Future studies should pay specific attention to the effects of acupuncture on long-term functional outcomes. Notably, only two trials in this updated review investigated the effects of acupuncture on hemorrhagic stroke. Data show possible differences between symptoms and consequently between the results of acupuncture in patients with ischemic versus hemorrhagic stroke; thus wider research studies in the future should be sure to include people with hemorrhagic stroke. In addition, further reliable studies in other ethnic populations (alongside the Asian ones) are required to identify population-specific response differences.</P></IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH></CONCLUSIONS></BODY><ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS MODIFIED="2018-03-30 11:23:59 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>We thank Hazel Fraser (Managing Editor, Cochrane Stroke Group) for the search of the Cochrane Stroke Group trials register, and Brenda Thomas (Trials Search Co-ordinator) and Joshua Cheyne (Information Specialist) for the searches of CINAHL and AMED databases.
