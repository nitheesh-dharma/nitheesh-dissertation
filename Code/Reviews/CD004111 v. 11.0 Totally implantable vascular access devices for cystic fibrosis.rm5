<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2008-07-01 10:39:54 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>Cystic fibrosis blocks the lungs with mucus and causes frequent infections and lung damage. Infections are often treated by giving drugs intravenously (through a vein), but regular injections can damage veins. Another option is to use a totally implantable vascular access device (TIVAD). There are different types of device and people with cystic fibrosis or their families can be shown how to administer drugs through them. TIVADs have no external portion attached when not in use and long-term maintenance is quite easy. Some people feel that the devices improve their self-image while others do not like the way they look. Sometimes TIVADs cause blood clots and infections. We looked for randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials of these devices in people with cystic fibrosis. The review found no trials to include. Reports of the use of TIVADs in people with cystic fibrosis suggest that they are safe and effective. They also suggest that certain interventions might reduce the risk of complications; however, these issues have not been examined by randomised controlled trials. We think a multicentre randomised controlled trial is needed to assess the efficacy and possible adverse effects of TIVADs in cystic fibrosis.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-04-10 11:41:00 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2008-04-10 11:40:23 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most common genetic disorder in Caucasians (<LINK REF="REF-Connor-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Connor 1997</LINK>). People with CF usually become colonised with bacteria such as <I>Pseudomonas aeruginosa </I>and often suffer exacerbation of their chest disease requiring frequent, regular courses of intravenous antibiotics. Over time, people with CF often lose peripheral venous access and require an indwelling central venous catheter for the rest of their lives. Totally implantable vascular access devices (TIVAD) have emerged as an effective means for intermittent venous access for therapeutic infusions. </P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2008-04-10 11:40:25 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>TIVAD consist of a subcutaneously placed reservoir attached to a silastic catheter placed in a central vein (<LINK REF="REF-Morris-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morris 1990</LINK>). Different kinds of devices exist. The commonest device used in people with CF is the Port-a-cath<SUP>® </SUP>system. This consists of a silicone catheter attached to a stainless steel portal with a self -sealing silicone septum (<LINK REF="REF-Ball-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ball 1989</LINK>). The chamber is accessed with a Huber needle, which has a specially designed tip to avoid damaging the silicone septum. Other types of TIVAD such as peripheral access systems (PAS), bared access systems (such as Groshongs, Hickman lines and Broviacs) are also used. People with CF or their carers can be trained, under appropriate instructions from CF specialist nurses, to use the system for administering antibiotics in the home.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2008-04-10 11:40:44 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>TIVAD have many advantages when compared to external indwelling catheters: there is no external portion attached when the device is not in use so physical activity is not limited; long-term maintenance is relatively easy and is done by flushing with heparinized saline once every four to six weeks (<LINK REF="REF-Morris-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morris 1990</LINK>). People with CF have different attitudes towards the cosmetic appearance of these devices and the subsequent effect of these on their self-image. Some people feel that the devices improve their self-image while others perceive them as cosmetically unsatisfactory (<LINK REF="REF-Rodgers-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rodgers 1998</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2008-04-10 11:41:03 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>There has been research looking into whether these devices are effective in improving clinical outcomes in people with CF and this suggests that they may be an effective and safe way of administering intravenous antibiotics (<LINK REF="REF-Aitken-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aitken 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ball-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ball 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Burdon-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burdon 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Morris-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morris 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rodgers-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rodgers 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Yung-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yung 1996</LINK>). A number of complications have been associated with the use of these devices including thrombosis, embolism, infection, pneumothorax and air embolism. A retrospective analysis of 452 TIVAD in 36 CF centres showed a complication rate of 42% which was mainly due to occlusion (<LINK REF="REF-Munck-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Munck 2004</LINK>). This study identified the use of polyurethane (versus silicone) and the routine use of devices for blood sampling as significant risk factors for causing complications leading to removal of the device (<LINK REF="REF-Munck-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Munck 2004</LINK>). It is unclear if there are other factors associated with a higher risk of complications; or if there are any interventions which may reduce the incidence of complications and prolong the survival of these devices.</P>
</IMPORTANCE>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>The aim of this review is to assess if TIVAD are a safe and effective route for providing venous access for intermittent administration of antibiotics in people with CF. The review will also assess strategies to reduce possible complications of TIVAD (e.g. anticoagulants to reduce the risk of thrombosis).</P>

In particular, authors will examine details of the randomisation method, whether the trial was blinded and who was blinded. Assessment of blinded trial quality will be made according to generation of allocation schedule; measures taken to conceal treatment allocation; measures taken to implement double blinding; whether intention-to-treat analyses were possible from the available data; and if the number of participants lost to follow up or subsequently excluded from the trial was recorded. If we judge these criteria to have been adequately addressed, we will attribute a low risk of bias to them; if these are not adequately addressed, they will be recorded as having a high risk of bias.

<DISCUSSION>
<P>It is disappointing that despite the wide use of TIVAD in people with CF, there are no RCTs to rigorously evaluate their use in this group of people. These devices, though very effective in providing long-term venous access, have potential for causing serious complications such as thrombosis, embolism, occlusion and infection. It would be valuable to assess the use of TIVAD in comparison with other means of delivering intravenous therapy in people with CF. A recent study by Munck concluded that TIVAD are relatively safe and reliable for providing long-term venous access; they identified catheter material and blood sampling as some of the risk factors leading to removal of these devices (<LINK REF="REF-Munck-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Munck 2004</LINK>). They also concluded that the insertion site significantly influenced incidence of vascular thrombosis (<LINK REF="REF-Munck-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Munck 2004</LINK>). As we believe this subject is important, we think that a multicentred RCT looking at these devices to explore the optimal management of such devices and the possible use of anti-platelet drugs and heparin to reduce the risks of vascular complications will provide useful information for both clinicians and people with CF. Such a trial will also allow people with CF to make informed decisions when they consider having these devices implanted.</P>
<P>A wide range of trials has been performed regarding the use of these devices in people with cancer. Although this might provide useful information, it is difficult to generalise these trials to people with CF since there are significant differences between the groups. </P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>No conclusions can be made about the use of TIVAD in people with CF from the information currently available. Clinicians must balance potential benefit against the possible risk of complications in each case.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>This systematic review has identified the need for a well-designed, adequately-powered, multicentre, RCT to assess the efficacy and safety of the use of TIVAD in people with CF compared to other means of vascular access, to compare the different types of these devices with each other and to assess strategies to reduce any complications of TIVAD.</P>
