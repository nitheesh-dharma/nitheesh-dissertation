<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2016-04-29 17:04:20 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="KLJ ">
<P>
<B>Review question</B>
</P>
<P>Is there new evidence for benefit from corticosteroids for prolongation of walking, and improving muscle strength and functional abilities in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), particularly over the long term (more than two years)? Are different corticosteroids, or different regimens equally effective, with similar side effect profiles?</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>DMD is an incurable disease beginning in childhood that almost exclusively affects boys. Muscle wasting and loss of walking lead to wheelchair dependence and early death. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) have shown that corticosteroids improve muscle strength and function for up to six months and strength up to two years (evidence on function at two years is limited). Data from other study types suggest that corticosteroids produce better function over a five-year period in many patients. Overall, long-term benefit remains unclear, and has to be weighed against long-term side effects. It is also unclear whether different corticosteroids differ greatly in side effects. Earlier versions of this review found insufficient evidence to determine whether an intermittent regimen is as effective as a daily regime, or produces fewer side effects.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>We found 12 studies of corticosteroid treatment in DMD, involving a total of 667 randomised boys; two other studies are ongoing. Among the 12 completed studies, the treatments were: a corticosteroid versus inactive medicine (placebo) (in nine trials); daily versus weekend-only prednisone (in one trial); and deflazacort versus prednisone (in three trials). Some studies included more than one comparison; some were not fully reported or provided results that could not be analysed.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results and quality of the evidence</B>
</P>
<P>One trial, a two-year study comparing a corticosteroid (deflazacort) with placebo, assessed the effects of corticosteroids on the ability to continue walking, but the data were not suitable for analysis. Most studies did not report ability to continue walking.</P>
<P>At the usual 0.75 mg/kg/day dose, corticosteroids improved muscle strength and function over six months compared to placebo. These results are based on combined data (up to 152 participants) from four trials, which provided moderate quality evidence. Improvements were seen in timed tests (eg. timed walk or run, time to stand, stair climb), ability to lift weights, a leg function grade, and a measure of the strength of muscles used in breathing. Evidence from single trials showed 0.75 mg/kg/day prednisone to be superior to 0.3 mg/kg/day on most strength and function tests, with little evidence of greater benefit at 1.5 mg/kg/day. Changes in appearance and hair growth were more common at 0.75 mg/kg/day than 0.3 mg/kg/day.</P>
<P>One RCT (n = 66) also reported better strength, function and quality of life at 12 months with daily 0.75 mg/kg/day prednisone. The two-year RCT, which had 28 participants, showed that deflazacort stabilised muscle strength for up to two years compared to placebo. This study did not show benefit on timed tests at two years; however, these results are imprecise and at high risk of bias, with less than half the original participants contributing data.</P>
<P>One trial found that changes in muscle strength and function were similar with daily and weekend-only prednisone regimens over a 12-month period (low to moderate quality evidence).</P>
<P>Two small RCTs compared daily prednisone 0.75 mg/kg/day with daily deflazacort 0.9 mg/kg/day, but trial methods did not allow comparisons of muscle strength or function.</P>
<P>Previous versions of this review have found adverse events such as excessive weight gain, abnormal behaviour, changes in appearance, and abnormal hair growth to be more common with corticosteroids than with placebo. We assessed the quality of evidence for abnormal behaviour and weight gain for this review and found it to be moderate. The newer study of daily versus weekend-only prednisone showed that both groups gained weight. The body mass index (BMI; a measure of weight for height) did not show any clear difference between the regimens (low quality evidence). The weekend-only group had a greater increase in height. According to very low quality evidence from two studies, deflazacort appeared to cause less weight gain at one year than prednisone, and no significant difference in numbers with behaviour change. Data were insufficient to assess the risk of fractures or cataracts.</P>
<P>The evidence is up to date to February 2016.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2016-04-29 16:51:35 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="KLJ ">
<P>Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is the most common muscular dystrophy of childhood. Untreated, this incurable disease, which has an X-linked recessive inheritance, is characterised by muscle wasting and loss of walking ability, leading to complete wheelchair dependence by 13 years of age. Prolongation of walking is a major aim of treatment. Evidence from randomised controlled trials (RCTs) indicates that corticosteroids significantly improve muscle strength and function in boys with DMD in the short term (six months), and strength at two years (two-year data on function are very limited). Corticosteroids, now part of care recommendations for DMD, are largely in routine use, although questions remain over their ability to prolong walking, when to start treatment, longer-term balance of benefits versus harms, and choice of corticosteroid or regimen.</P>
<P>We have extended the scope of this updated review to include comparisons of different corticosteroids and dosing regimens.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2016-04-27 10:44:45 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Ruth  Brassington">
<P>To assess the effects of corticosteroids on prolongation of walking ability, muscle strength, functional ability, and quality of life in DMD; to address the question of whether benefit is maintained over the longer term (more than two years); to assess adverse events; and to compare efficacy and adverse effects of different corticosteroid preparations and regimens.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2016-04-29 16:51:48 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="KLJ ">
<P>On 16 February 2016 we searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL Plus, and LILACS. We wrote to authors of published studies and other experts. We checked references in identified trials, handsearched journal abstracts, and searched trials registries.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2016-04-15 12:46:49 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Ruth  Brassington">
<P>We considered RCTs or quasi-RCTs of corticosteroids (e.g. prednisone, prednisolone, and deflazacort) given for a minimum of three months to patients with a definite DMD diagnosis. We considered comparisons of different corticosteroids, regimens, and corticosteroids versus placebo.<BR/>
</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2016-02-12 08:25:56 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Ruth  Brassington">
<P>The review authors followed standard Cochrane methodology.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-04-29 16:53:03 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="KLJ ">
<P>We identified 12 studies (667 participants) and two new ongoing studies for inclusion. Six RCTs were newly included at this update and important non-randomised cohort studies have also been published. Some important studies remain unpublished and not all published studies provide complete outcome data.</P>
<P>Primary outcome measure: one two-year deflazacort RCT (n = 28) used prolongation of ambulation as an outcome measure but data were not adequate for drawing conclusions.</P>
<P>Secondary outcome measures: meta-analyses showed that corticosteroids (0.75 mg/kg/day prednisone or prednisolone) improved muscle strength and function versus placebo over six months (moderate quality evidence from up to four RCTs). Evidence from single trials showed 0.75 mg/kg/day superior to 0.3 mg/kg/day on most strength and function measures, with little evidence of further benefit at 1.5 mg/kg/day. Improvements were seen in time taken to rise from the floor (Gowers' time), timed walk, four-stair climbing time, ability to lift weights, leg function grade, and forced vital capacity. One new RCT (n = 66), reported better strength, function and quality of life with daily 0.75 mg/kg/day prednisone at 12 months. One RCT (n = 28) showed that deflazacort stabilised muscle strength versus placebo at two years, but timed function test results were too imprecise for conclusions to be drawn.</P>
<P>One double-blind RCT (n = 64), largely at low risk of bias, compared daily prednisone (0.75 mg/kg/day) with weekend-only prednisone (5 mg/kg/weekend day), finding no overall difference in muscle strength and function over 12 months (moderate to low quality evidence). Two small RCTs (n = 52) compared daily prednisone 0.75 mg/kg/day with daily deflazacort 0.9 mg/kg/day, but study methods limited our ability to compare muscle strength or function.</P>
<P>Adverse effects: excessive weight gain, behavioural abnormalities, cushingoid appearance, and excessive hair growth were all previously shown to be more common with corticosteroids than placebo; we assessed the quality of evidence (for behavioural changes and weight gain) as moderate. Hair growth and cushingoid features were more frequent at 0.75 mg/kg/day than 0.3 mg/kg/day prednisone. Comparing daily versus weekend-only prednisone, both groups gained weight with no clear difference in body mass index (BMI) or in behavioural changes (low quality evidence for both outcomes, one study); the weekend-only group had a greater linear increase in height. Very low quality evidence suggested less weight gain with deflazacort than with prednisone at 12 months, and no difference in behavioural abnormalities. Data are insufficient to assess the risk of fractures or cataracts for any comparison.</P>
<P>Non-randomised studies support RCT evidence in showing improved functional benefit from corticosteroids. These studies suggest sustained benefit for up to 66 months. Adverse effects were common, although generally manageable. According to a large comparative longitudinal study of daily or intermittent (10 days on, 10 days off) corticosteroid for a mean period of four years, a daily regimen prolongs ambulation and improves functional scores over the age of seven, but with a greater frequency of side effects than an intermittent regimen.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2016-04-29 16:53:15 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="KLJ ">
<P>Moderate quality evidence from RCTs indicates that corticosteroid therapy in DMD improves muscle strength and function in the short term (twelve months), and strength up to two years. On the basis of the evidence available for strength and function outcomes, our confidence in the effect estimate for the efficacy of a 0.75 mg/kg/day dose of prednisone or above is fairly secure. There is no evidence other than from non-randomised trials to establish the effect of corticosteroids on prolongation of walking. In the short term, adverse effects were significantly more common with corticosteroids than placebo, but not clinically severe. A weekend-only prednisone regimen is as effective as daily prednisone in the short term (12 months), according to low to moderate quality evidence from a single trial, with no clear difference in BMI (low quality evidence). Very low quality evidence indicates that deflazacort causes less weight gain than prednisone after a year's treatment. We cannot evaluate long-term benefits and hazards of corticosteroid treatment or intermittent regimens from published RCTs. Non-randomised studies support the conclusions of functional benefits, but also identify clinically significant adverse effects of long-term treatment, and a possible divergence of efficacy in daily and weekend-only regimens in the longer term. These benefits and adverse effects have implications for future research and clinical practice.</P>

<P>Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), which has an incidence of 1 in 3500 to 1 in 5000 male live births (<LINK REF="REF-Emery-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Emery 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mendell-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mendell 2012</LINK>), is the most common muscular dystrophy of childhood.</P>
<P>Boys with DMD present in the first five years of life with abnormal gait, inability to run, and difficulty in rising from the floor. Untreated, the combination of muscle weakness and contractures of the tendo Achilles and iliotibial bands leads to loss of independent walking at a mean age of 9.5 years (range 7 to 13 years). Before corticosteroids were routinely used, once these boys become constant wheelchair users, over 50% developed scoliosis. Subclinical cardiomyopathy is very common, but this becomes symptomatic only in about 20% of patients, often in the second decade of life (<LINK REF="REF-Frankel-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Frankel 1976</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ishikawa-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ishikawa 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ishikawa-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ishikawa 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Muntoni-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Muntoni 2003</LINK>). The late teen years are marked by progression of respiratory muscle weakness, nocturnal hypoventilation, respiratory failure, and death in late teens or twenties in untreated patients. No curative treatment for DMD is known, but the quality of life and comfort of the patient can be improved by symptomatic physiotherapeutic and medical treatments (<LINK REF="REF-Bushby-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bushby 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Dubowitz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dubowitz 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Emery-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Emery 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Heckmatt-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heckmatt 1989</LINK>). Provision of respiratory support, with ventilator use at the appropriate stage, can prolong survival into the fourth decade (<LINK REF="REF-Eagle-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eagle 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Eagle-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eagle 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gomez_x002d_Merino-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gomez-Merino 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jeppesen-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jeppesen 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>The DMD gene locus is at Xp21 and codes for a protein named dystrophin (<LINK REF="REF-Hoffman-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hoffman 1987</LINK>). Depending on the type of mutation in the dystrophin gene, there may be a severe reduction or absence of dystrophin in muscle, resulting in DMD (<LINK REF="REF-Koenig-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Koenig 1989</LINK>). Dystrophin localises at the cytoplasmic side of the sarcolemma and binds to a glycoprotein complex (<LINK REF="REF-Matsumura-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Matsumura 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Matsumura-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Matsumura 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mendell-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mendell 1995</LINK>). This dystrophin-glycoprotein complex provides a link between the cytoskeleton of the muscle fibre and the extracellular matrix. Lack of dystrophin compromises this link and is postulated to lead to muscle fibre degeneration (<LINK REF="REF-Deconinck-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deconinck 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Petrof-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Petrof 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Petrof-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Petrof 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>Although DMD is not primarily an immune-mediated disease, some evidence raises the possibility that humoral and cellular immune responses contribute to the pathological processes. This includes invasion of necrotic muscle fibres by macrophages and cytotoxic T-cells (<LINK REF="REF-Arahata-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Arahata 1984</LINK>), complement activation with deposition of membrane attack complexes on necrotic fibres, and expression of HLA class I antigens on the dystrophic muscle fibres (<LINK REF="REF-Engel-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Engel 1982</LINK>), making them susceptible to T-cell mediated damage. Initial empirical studies of prednisone in DMD (e.g. <LINK REF="STD-Drachman-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Drachman 1974</LINK>) and the above histopathological observations led to trials of immunomodulation therapy with corticosteroids (<LINK REF="STD-Angelini-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Angelini 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-B_x00e4_ckman-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Bäckman 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Biggar-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Biggar 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bonifati-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Bonifati 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dubowitz-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Dubowitz 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fenichel-1991a" TYPE="STUDY">Fenichel 1991a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fenichel-1991b" TYPE="STUDY">Fenichel 1991b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Griggs-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Griggs 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Griggs-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Griggs 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mendell-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Mendell 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mesa-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Mesa 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sansome-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Sansome 1993</LINK>), azathioprine (<LINK REF="STD-Griggs-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Griggs 1993</LINK>), and ciclosporin (<LINK REF="REF-Sharma-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sharma 1993</LINK>). Complimentary DNA (cDNA) microarray studies on the mdx mouse demonstrated a differential gene expression in affected and non-affected muscles (<LINK REF="REF-Porter-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Porter 2003</LINK>), and a "skeletal muscle molecular signature" dominated by chronic inflammatory response (<LINK REF="REF-Porter-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Porter 2002</LINK>). A study of cDNA microarray analysis of skeletal muscle from DMD patients reported a variable gene expression pattern that correlated with the severity of dystrophic changes on histological examination (<LINK REF="REF-Noguchi-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Noguchi 2003</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-Pescatori-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pescatori 2007</LINK> undertook gene expression profiling of skeletal muscle from DMD patients and reported induction of genes involved in the inflammatory response, extracellular matrix remodeling and muscle regeneration, and reduced transcription of genes involved in energy metabolism. <LINK REF="REF-Dudley-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dudley 2006</LINK> investigated the interactive effect of mechanical and oxidative stresses in pathogenesis of muscle fibre damage in dystrophin-deficient mdx mice and normal wild-type control mice. Their experiments suggested that sarcolemmal damage in dystrophin deficiency is modulated by synergistic interactions between mechanical and oxidative stresses. Taken together, these quoted studies provide further evidence that the absence of dystrophin, though necessary, is not sufficient to cause the pattern of fibrosis, inflammation, and muscle degeneration and regeneration, characteristic of DMD.</P>

<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2016-04-29 17:04:44 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="KLJ ">
<P>Over the last three decades, many studies of the use of prednisone, prednisolone and deflazacort in DMD have been published. In the neuromuscular literature, authors often described these medications as "steroids" (e.g. <LINK REF="REF-Dubrovsky-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dubrovsky 1998</LINK>) or "corticosteroids" (e.g. <LINK REF="REF-Bushby-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bushby 2004</LINK> and <LINK REF="REF-Moxley-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moxley 2005</LINK>). Corticosteroids (the steroids produced by the adrenal cortex) may have a predominant glucocorticoid or mineralocorticoid activity. The relevant corticosteroids in neuromuscular practice (prednisone, prednisolone, and deflazacort) have a predominant glucocorticoid action, and their dose equivalence, toxicity and possibly, at least one mode of action relates to this glucocorticoid activity.</P>
<P>The commonly used corticosteroids in published trials are prednisone, prednisolone, and deflazacort. The corticosteroid dose used in various trials for prednisolone or its equivalent ranges from 0.3 mg/kg/day to 1.5 mg/kg/day, given daily or on alternate days, or in an intermittent (10 days on, 10 or 20 days off) regimen (<LINK REF="STD-Angelini-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Angelini 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Beenakker-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Beenakker 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Escolar-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Escolar 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Griggs-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Griggs 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mendell-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Mendell 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dubowitz-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Dubowitz 2002</LINK>).</P>

<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2016-04-29 17:04:53 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="KLJ ">
<P>Evaluation of the role of corticosteroids in DMD by systematic reviews, such as <LINK REF="STD-Wong-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Wong 2002</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Campbell-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Campbell 2003</LINK>, and <LINK REF="REF-Moxley-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moxley 2005</LINK>, helped the development of clinical practice parameters (<LINK REF="REF-Moxley-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moxley 2005</LINK>), and international workshops establishing standards for use of corticosteroids in DMD (<LINK REF="REF-Bushby-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bushby 2004</LINK>). Although many observers claimed a beneficial effect on muscle strength, the long-term functional benefit remained unclear, and had to be weighed against the short-term and long-term side effects and tolerability of these drugs.</P>
<P>The previous version of this review examined RCT evidence that showed corticosteroid therapy in DMD improved muscle strength and function in the short term (six months), and evidence exists for benefit on strength at two years, although no conclusions can be drawn from two-year timed function data, which are very limited. The most effective prednisone regimen appeared to be 0.75 mg/kg/day given daily. In the short term, adverse effects were significantly more common with corticosteroids than placebo, but not clinically severe. Long-term benefits and hazards of corticosteroid treatment could not be evaluated from the published RCTs at that time. Since the last review, care recommendations for DMD have been published that recommend the use of corticosteroids (<LINK REF="REF-Bushby-2010a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bushby 2010a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bushby-2010b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bushby 2010b</LINK>). However, additional questions important to clinical practice about the choice of corticosteroid, optimal dosage regimens, long-term outcomes, and age of initiation or discontinuation of treatment remain (<LINK REF="REF-Bushby-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bushby 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bushby-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bushby 2007</LINK>). Updating systematic reviews such as this one is essential to answer these questions and plan further studies.</P>

<MISSING_DATA MODIFIED="2016-04-25 16:12:19 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Ruth  Brassington">
<P>We sought full reports from authors where trials were published in abstract form, presented at meetings or presented as posters, and we contacted trial authors to obtain missing or ambiguously reported data. Because a number of the published papers gave only P values and means or differences (<LINK REF="STD-Griggs-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Griggs 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mendell-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Mendell 1989</LINK>), we inferred the standard deviations (SDs) and other quantities required for the RevMan meta-analysis by inverting the P value calculations. Care was required by a statistician to obtain reasonable values from what were sometimes very small and 'rounded' P values. One study reported the difference (and P values) in responses as daily rate of change, obtained from a regression using data from a six-month follow-up period (<LINK REF="STD-Beenakker-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Beenakker 2005</LINK>). We scaled up the response to 24 weeks (six months) equivalent, and deduced the standard error (SE) from the P values, assuming they had been obtained using a normal (the 1.96 cut-off) rather than a t-test, because RevMan assumes normality, and any other approach would give conflicting results. However, the P values were sometimes very small and rounding errors may make the results very approximate, so results using these inferred SEs have to be interpreted cautiously.</P>

<P>The review included too few trials in any one analysis to reliably assess small study effects using funnel plots.

<DATA_SYNTHESIS MODIFIED="2016-04-29 17:41:00 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="KLJ ">
<P>Where appropriate, we pooled estimates from individual studies to obtain overall estimates and 95% CIs. For continuous outcome measures we did this using the MD with corresponding 95% CIs. The MD is a method of meta-analysis used to combine differences between treatment effects from different studies when the outcomes are measured in the same units in each trial. It averages the differences from the studies involved in the meta-analysis, weighting them according to precision of the effect estimate.</P>
<P>If any of the studies using a common outcome measure did not report the SD or we could not deduce it, we deduced the SE and pooled estimates from the individual studies using the Revman GIV facility to obtain overall estimates and 95% CIs. By this method, the weight given to each study is chosen to be the inverse of the variance of the effect estimate (i.e. one over the square of its standard error). Thus, larger studies, which have smaller SEs, receive more weight than smaller studies, which have larger SEs. This choice of weight minimises the imprecision (uncertainty) of the pooled effect estimate. For dichotomous outcomes, we used RRs with corresponding 95% CI. To include an additional study in GIV meta-analyses at this update, we entered available data into the calculator tool available in RevMan to produce a mean and SE with 95% CI.</P>

<P>The number of papers found by the first electronic searches for this update in April 2015 were: Cochrane Neuromuscular Specialised Register 57, CENTRAL 68, MEDLINE 221 (65 new papers), EMBASE 95 (36 new papers), CINAHL Plus 39 (16 new papers), and LILACS 3, with a further 84 references (57 after removal of duplicates) from a late search in February 2016 (Register 17, CENTRAL 18, MEDLINE 10, EMBASE 29, CINAHL 10, and LILACS 0). We identified two additional records from reference lists of included studies.</P>
<P>Simple searches of clinical trials registries in April 2016 revealed 13 references in ClinicalTrials.gov and 16 references in the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. From these we identified two trial reports: <LINK REF="STD-CTRI_x002f_2009_x002f_091_x002f_000738" TYPE="STUDY">CTRI/2009/091/000738</LINK>, which is an ongoing trial, and <LINK REF="STD-ACTRN12605000075684" TYPE="STUDY">ACTRN12605000075684</LINK>, which did not provide enough information for eligibility to be assessed. Although listed as recruiting (as of April 2016), this trial was registered on ICTRP in 2005.</P>
<P>After deduplicating the new references above in the Cochrane Register of Studies software or manually, we obtained 163 new references.</P>
<P>For the previous version of the review, six studies met the inclusion criteria and had been published in full in peer reviewed journals (<LINK REF="STD-Angelini-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Angelini 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-B_x00e4_ckman-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Bäckman 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Beenakker-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Beenakker 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Griggs-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Griggs 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mendell-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Mendell 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rahman-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Rahman 2001</LINK>). All six trials randomised participants to corticosteroids against placebo (five to prednisolone or prednisone for six months and one to deflazacort for two years).</P>
<P>In this update, we identified six additional trials for inclusion:</P>
<UL>
<LI>three new randomised studies published since the last version of the review (<LINK REF="STD-Escolar-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Escolar 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hu-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Hu 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Karimzadeh-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Karimzadeh 2012</LINK>);</LI>
<LI>one previously excluded study comparing deflazacort and prednisone (<LINK REF="STD-Bonifati-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Bonifati 2000</LINK>), now eligible because of the expanded scope of the review to evaluate evidence from comparative trials of corticosteroids;</LI>
<LI>two previously excluded studies published only as abstracts, as this is current Cochrane practice (<LINK REF="STD-Brooke-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Brooke 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Todorovic-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Todorovic 1998</LINK>).

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Corticosteroids versus placebo</HEADING>
<P>See <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>.</P>
<P>We included data from five randomised, parallel-group, double-blind studies of corticosteroids versus placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Angelini-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Angelini 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Griggs-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Griggs 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hu-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Hu 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mendell-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Mendell 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rahman-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Rahman 2001</LINK>), and one randomised, placebo-controlled, cross-over trial (<LINK REF="STD-Beenakker-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Beenakker 2005</LINK>). Overall, these studies comprised 332 participants. The 315 participants in the randomised parallel-group trials involved 88 in the placebo groups and 161 in the corticosteroid treatment groups (<LINK REF="STD-Angelini-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Angelini 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Griggs-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Griggs 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hu-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Hu 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mendell-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Mendell 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rahman-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Rahman 2001</LINK>). One hundred and one of the 218 participants in the control groups and 164 of the 197 in the corticosteroid groups were walking, either independently or with the help of long leg braces. The corticosteroid treatment groups included prednisone (n = 170), prednisolone (n = 10), and deflazacort (n = 17). <LINK REF="STD-Beenakker-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Beenakker 2005</LINK> was a cross-over study comprising 17 boys, all walking independently, who received prednisone during the six-month active treatment period.</P>
<P>In three of the included studies, all lasting six months, treatment groups received prednisone or prednisolone in a daily dose regimen (<LINK REF="STD-Griggs-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Griggs 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mendell-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Mendell 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rahman-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Rahman 2001</LINK>). These studies included a total of 144 participants in the treatment group and 77 in the placebo group. Prednisone is broken down in the body to prednisolone and they are equipotent in glucocorticoid effect (<LINK REF="REF-Azarnoff-1975" TYPE="REFERENCE">Azarnoff 1975</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Frey-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Frey 1990</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Beenakker-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Beenakker 2005</LINK>, used an intermittent regimen, prednisone 0.75 mg/kg/day given for the first 10 days of every month, in the active treatment phase. The participants were 17 independently ambulant boys. One study (n = 28) used deflazacort (2 mg/kg body weight on alternate days for two years) in the treatment group (<LINK REF="STD-Angelini-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Angelini 1994</LINK>). This was the only study to address the primary outcome measure of prolongation of walking.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Hu-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Hu 2015</LINK> was a placebo-controlled study of 66 independently ambulant boys and the only placebo-controlled corticosteroid study published since the previous update of this review. The intervention was prednisone 0.75 mg/kg/day given daily for a year.</P>
<P>The secondary outcome measures of this review were assessed by different parameters and assessment tools in the five prednisolone/prednisone studies that were published in full and which provided data for our secondary outcomes. However, <LINK REF="STD-Mendell-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Mendell 1989</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Griggs-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Griggs 1991</LINK>, the two studies that comprised 80% of the participants for all the four included and analysed studies, used the same outcome measures, as described in <LINK REF="REF-Brooke-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brooke 1981</LINK> (see <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Beenakker-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Beenakker 2005</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Hu-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Hu 2015</LINK>, and <LINK REF="STD-Rahman-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Rahman 2001</LINK>, the other three published studies of prednisolone or prednisone, also used some of these outcome measures.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-B_x00e4_ckman-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Bäckman 1995</LINK>, a cross-over trial, reported efficacy as the numbers improving (improved or unchanged across two-thirds or more of the tested measures) and numbers deteriorating during treatment with prednisolone (0.35 mg/kg/day) or placebo. The participants were 37 boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) (22 of whom were ambulant) and four with Becker muscular dystrophy. Although outcome data were not adequate for inclusion in the review, the trial provided some adverse event data.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Todorovic-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Todorovic 1998</LINK> was a 20-month study involving 34 boys, who received prednisone 2 mg/kg alternate days (high dose) or placebo. No results have been published.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Brooke-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Brooke 1996</LINK> was a 12-month randomised, double-blind comparative trial with four arms: placebo, prednisone 0.75 mg/kg, deflazacort 0.9 mg/kg, and deflazacort 1.2 mg/kg, published in abstract form. We presume, although the abstract does not specify, that these were daily doses. After three months, participants in the placebo group were randomised to one of the three active treatment arms and followed up for a further nine months. The abstract presents data for the average muscle score (the method of measurement is not defined), and for weight gain as a percentage of baseline weight. This study was large, at 196 randomised participants, but we were unable to obtain data to allow for any analysis.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Weekend-only versus daily prednisone</HEADING>
<P>Only one randomised study provided data for a comparison of different prednisone dosing regimes. <LINK REF="STD-Escolar-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Escolar 2011</LINK> performed a double-blind placebo-controlled randomised study comparing daily prednisone 0.75 mg/kg/day (and weekend placebo) with weekend-only prednisone 5 mg/kg/weekend day (and daily placebo), taken over a 12-month period. The study comprised 64 eligible participants with a mean age of 7.3 years (range 4 to 10), all of whom were ambulant at the start. The study did not measure the primary outcome of this review, prolongation of time to loss of ambulation, but assessed secondary outcomes at 12 months using multiple measures, including the change from baseline of quantitative muscle testing (QMT) arm and leg scores, and mean body mass index (BMI).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Deflazacort versus prednisone</HEADING>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Bonifati-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Bonifati 2000</LINK>, a double-blind study, randomised 18 participants to treatment with 0.75 mg/kg/day prednisone (mean age 7.5 years, range, 5.1 to 10) or 0.9 mg/kg/day deflazacort (mean age 8.6 years, range 5.3 to 14.6) for 12 months. Investigators assessed muscle strength and function using a summed Medical Research Council (MRC) score of four muscles (two right upper limb, two right lower limb) and a summed functional score comprising several timed assessments including a 10-metre walk, rise from chair and floor, and four-stair climbing. Mean weight increase after 12 months was expressed as a percentage of initial weight. The trial authors presented outcome data for MRC scores, functional scores, and weight increase graphically, limiting full analysis. They tabulated adverse events. We requested further data but received no response from study authors.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Karimzadeh-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Karimzadeh 2012</LINK> initially randomised 34 participants to either prednisone 0.75 mg/kg/day or deflazacort 0.9 mg/kg/day. Eight early dropouts occurred, but the trial continued for 12 months with 14 participants in the deflazacort group (mean age 7.1 years, range 3.2 to 10.5) and 12 in the prednisone group (mean age 7.37 years, range 6 to 10). In total, the study ran for 18 months, but at 12 months a further four participants were excluded from the prednisone group due to unacceptable weight gain; these four also had poor motor function scores. The report presented limited outcome data at 12 and 18 months. We contacted study authors for more data but did not receive a reply.</P>
<P>As noted above, <LINK REF="STD-Brooke-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Brooke 1996</LINK> also studied this comparison but did not provide data for analysis.</P>

<P>Only <LINK REF="STD-Angelini-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Angelini 1994</LINK> (n = 28), a two-year study, used prolongation of time to loss of ambulation as an outcome measure. The other studies were of short duration (six months or one year), and not designed to demonstrate prolongation of walking.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Angelini-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Angelini 1994</LINK> reported that deflazacort (2 mg/kg on alternate days) prolonged ambulation by 13 months, but the statistical technique used to infer this result was not appropriate. Four of the 17 participants in the deflazacort group became wheelchair dependent, at a mean interval of 33.2 months after randomisation, versus six of 11 placebo participants, at a mean interval of 20.5 months. The trial authors reported the difference of 13 months between these two sets of participants who lost walking ability as "mean prolongation of walking", ignoring the 13 participants in the deflazacort group and five in the placebo group who were still walking at the end of the study. The trialists did not report the age of boys who remained ambulant at the end of the study and this information was not available on contacting the lead investigator. We therefore were not able to construct Kaplan-Meier survival curves for evaluating prolongation of walking as an outcome measure.</P>

<P>A full investigation of the prednisone dose-response relationship to identify the optimum dose would need individual patient data within-study analyses, and the included studies reported no such analyses.

<P>Two studies made direct comparisons of prednisone doses (<LINK REF="STD-Griggs-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Griggs 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mendell-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Mendell 1989</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Griggs-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Griggs 1991</LINK> compared 0.3 mg/kg/day prednisone to 0.75 mg/kg/day prednisone, finding statistically significant differences in favour of the higher dose in average muscle strength scores (5.82 versus 6.00, P = 0.026, n = 65), time (seconds) to climb stairs (5.76 versus 4.23, P = 0.0014, n = 37), time (seconds) to stand (6.64 versus 4.56, P = 0.004, n = 33), and lifting weights (kg) (1.64 versus 2.04, P = 0.0006, n = 43), but no statistically significant differences in leg function grade (4.07 versus 4.19, P = 0.53, n = 63), time (seconds) to travel nine metres (7.33 versus 6.37, P = 0.127, n = 44), or measures of pulmonary function.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Mendell-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Mendell 1989</LINK> compared 0.75 mg/kg/day prednisone with 1.5 mg/kg/day prednisone, finding no statistically significant differences in strength or functional outcomes between the two doses: muscle strength score (6.23 versus 6.5, P = 0.84, n = 60), leg function grade (3.25 versus 3.36, P = 0.67, n = 64), time (seconds) to climb stairs (3.87 versus 4.00, P = 0.74, n = 47), time (seconds) to travel nine metres (6.81 versus 7.04, P = 0.77, n = 55), time (seconds) to stand (4.15 versus 3.43, P = 0.055, n = 34), lifting weights (1.88 versus 2.13, P = 0.06, n = 55), or in measures of pulmonary function.</P>
<P>From the forest plots showing studies grouped by dosage of prednisone on several outcome variables, the confidence in effect estimates for the efficacy of prednisone doses of 0.75 mg/kg/day or above appears fairly secure.

<P>The mean change from baseline to month 12 in the MMT score (SD) in 54 participants was 4 (24.3) in the weekend-only dosing group and -0.6 (23.2) in the daily dose group, with a MD of 4.60 (95% CI -8.07 to 17.27); low quality evidence. The trial authors defined an 'equivalence limit' for MMT as one point on the 10-point scale for each of the 34 muscles tested, which was ± 17 points; by this test, the upper CI just allows for the possibility of a difference between weekend-only and daily dosing.</P>
<P>Results for QMT scores all included data from 57 participants. For the QMT arm score and QMT leg score, the trial authors reported an equivalent improvement in the two groups (with equivalence defined as approximately 1 SD of the baseline distribution, which was ± 2 lb for all muscle strength tests). The mean change in QMT arm score from baseline (SD) was 0.70 lb (1.7) in the weekend-only dosing group and 1.3 lb (2.4) in the daily dose group.

<P>Data for 3-, 6- and 9-month time points were not provided by <LINK REF="STD-Karimzadeh-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Karimzadeh 2012</LINK>, and were presented graphically in <LINK REF="STD-Bonifati-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Bonifati 2000</LINK>, without any measures of variability. For <LINK REF="STD-Bonifati-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Bonifati 2000</LINK>, we read the data from the graph using the ruler method, and figures are therefore very approximate. The percentage body weight increase in the deflazacort and prednisone groups respectively were 2.5% and 6% at three months, 3% and 10% at six months, and 5.8% and 18% at nine months. The reported P value for the difference between groups was &lt; 0.05 at six months and "the difference remained statistically significant at 9 and 12 months".</P>

This was reported as a significant difference at an assumed significance threshold of P &lt; 0.05 (the stated significance threshold for the difference at 6 months). Using the most conservative value of P = 0.05 for the between-group difference at one year, and assuming that the SD of outcome measurements were the same in each group, the estimated SD was 11.88.

<LINK REF="STD-Karimzadeh-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Karimzadeh 2012</LINK> did not clearly report the numbers in which weight gain was measured at 12 months.

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-04-29 17:57:24 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="KLJ ">
<P>We identified 50 studies of corticosteroids in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) conducted over the last four decades. From these, 12 randomised controlled trials (RCTs), with a total of 667 participants, were eligible for inclusion in this review based on our predefined criteria.</P>
<P>Among these studies, six (n = 332) were RCTs comparing corticosteroids against placebo; five studied prednisolone or prednisone and one studied deflazacort. With regard to ambulatory status, 282 participants were walking, either independently or with the help of long leg braces. Two large studies contributed the majority of the patients (202 of 332) to the corticosteroid versus placebo comparison (<LINK REF="STD-Griggs-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Griggs 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mendell-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Mendell 1989</LINK>). The treatment groups within this comparison included prednisone (n = 217), prednisolone (n = 10) and deflazacort (n = 17). Unfortunately, two large studies of deflazacort in DMD comprising 206 participants in total have not been published beyond abstract form and their final data are not available (<LINK REF="STD-Brooke-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Brooke 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Reitter-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Reitter 1995</LINK>).</P>
<P>We identified one RCT of daily prednisone versus weekend-only prednisone in 64 ambulant boys and two RCTs (n = 52) of prednisone versus deflazacort. A further large multicentre international RCT comparing daily prednisolone (0.75 mg/kg/day), daily deflazacort (0.9 mg/kg.day), and intermittent prednisolone (0.75 mg/kg/day 10 days on, 10 days off) is of major interest, but still in progress at the time of this review (<LINK REF="STD-Guglieri-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Guglieri 2015</LINK>). A further potentially eligible RCT is in progress in India, comparing daily prednisolone 0.75 mg/kg/day given for 10 consecutive days per month versus daily dosing (<LINK REF="STD-CTRI_x002f_2009_x002f_091_x002f_000738" TYPE="STUDY">CTRI/2009/091/000738</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Primary outcome measure: prolongation of time to loss of ambulation</HEADING>
<P>Loss of ambulation is the key milestone in the natural history of DMD, and is of maximal functional significance. Prevention or postponement of this event is the key aim of therapeutic interventions in the first decade of life, and a desired outcome measure. Prolongation of time to loss of ambulation was not the stated primary outcome measure of most RCTs, probably because to achieve sufficient power to demonstrate this effect, studies would require a large sample size and long duration (<LINK REF="REF-Muntoni-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Muntoni 2002</LINK>). As progressive muscle weakness is the major contributor to loss of walking, trialists have used measurements of muscle strength as a surrogate marker, enabling clinical trials to be completed in as little as six months. These short-term studies do not demonstrate prolongation of time to loss of ambulation or allow evaluation of adverse effects that develop after long-term use of corticosteroids (<LINK REF="STD-Griggs-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Griggs 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mendell-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Mendell 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rahman-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Rahman 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>Although <LINK REF="STD-Angelini-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Angelini 1994</LINK> assessed our primary outcome measure, the data available did not allow us to create survival curves for prolongation of walking. Some disparities that cannot be readily explained further highlight the need for appropriate statistical analysis. Deflazacort and placebo groups were evenly matched at randomisation, and among participants who lost ambulation during the study, the mean age at which boys became wheelchair-dependent was very similar in the two groups (deflazacort group, 108 months; and placebo group, 104 months). Comparing these groups, the significance of the difference of 13 months in duration of walking between randomisation and becoming wheelchair-dependent cannot be ascertained without knowing the ages of the ambulant children at the end of the study.</P>

The improvement in muscle strength or force occurred with all four treatment regimens (0.75 mg/kg/day for the first ten days of every month, 0.3 mg/kg daily, 0.75 mg/kg daily and 1.5 mg/kg daily). Data from the other trials were lacking or not suitable for analysis.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Hu-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Hu 2015</LINK> was a 12-month study and demonstrated improvements in lower limb muscle strength at both six and 12 months. We could not include the data in meta-analysis because although investigators used MRC-based scores, they tested two muscles and did not combine results into a single score.</P>
<P>The two-year study of deflazacort (2 mg/kg on alternate days) versus placebo measured change in MRC index (%) over the initial score, demonstrating a difference in favour of deflazacort at 24 months, but not at 6 months (<LINK REF="STD-Angelini-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Angelini 1994</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Function</HEADING>
<P>Functional parameters showed statistically significant improvement over the short term (up to a year) in corticosteroid-treated groups. The functional parameters showing improvement included time taken to rise from the floor, time taken to walk nine metres, time taken to climb four stairs, and the leg functional grade. It is, however, important to note that none of the included studies reported any non-ambulant (wheelchair-dependent) participants regaining the ability to walk on treatment with prednisone.</P>

The muscle weakness in DMD leads to increasing difficulty in rising from the floor at around five years of age, with loss of this ability towards the end of the first decade of life.</P>
<P>Time taken to walk nine (or ten) metres showed a statistically significant improvement in all prednisone/prednisolone treatment groups versus placebo in five trials (<LINK REF="STD-Beenakker-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Beenakker 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Griggs-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Griggs 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hu-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Hu 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mendell-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Mendell 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rahman-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Rahman 2001</LINK>).

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Pulmonary function</HEADING>
<P>One of the desired effects of any successful treatment in DMD is the preservation of respiratory muscle strength, thereby preserving pulmonary function and postponing or removing the risk of nocturnal hyperventilation and respiratory failure. A good marker of respiratory reserve is forced vital capacity (FVC) and two of the large included studies measured this outcome (<LINK REF="STD-Griggs-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Griggs 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mendell-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Mendell 1989</LINK>). A statistically significant improvement in the FVC in all prednisone treatment groups versus placebo was present after six months of treatment. Parallel results are available from non-randomised cohort studies (<LINK REF="STD-Biggar-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Biggar 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Biggar-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Biggar 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Biggar-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Biggar 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Silversides-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Silversides 2003</LINK>), which showed strength improvement and stabilisation of FVC over the long term in deflazacort-treated patients (see below).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Quality of life</HEADING>
<P>Two trials measured quality of life (<LINK REF="STD-Beenakker-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Beenakker 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hu-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Hu 2015)</LINK>, with only <LINK REF="STD-Hu-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Hu 2015</LINK> providing numerical data. Self reported and proxy reported quality of life measures were better with prednisone 0.75 mg/kg/day than with placebo.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Adverse events</HEADING>
<P>Caution is required in extrapolating the adverse effects of corticosteroid therapy reported in these included studies to circumstances of long-term clinical use. Five of the seven included studies used daily doses of prednisone/prednisolone over a six-month period; one used a daily dose for a year. The longest included study, of two years' duration, used deflazacort 2 mg/kg on alternate days (<LINK REF="STD-Angelini-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Angelini 1994</LINK>). We would expect the side effects observed during these studies to be much less than those likely to occur during five years or longer use, as may be anticipated in clinical practice. These short-term studies would be unlikely to detect long-term adverse effects, especially loss of bone mineral density, increased bone fracture incidence, cataracts, and growth failure with short stature.</P>
<P>The propensity for excessive weight gain on corticosteroid treatment was clear. This did not appear to adversely affect strength or function in these short-term studies, except for one participant (in the prednisone 0.3 mg/kg/day group), who at the end of the six months of the <LINK REF="STD-Griggs-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Griggs 1991</LINK> study refused to continue to another subsequent study of prednisone versus azathioprine (<LINK REF="STD-Griggs-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Griggs 1993</LINK>). Behavioural changes and cushingoid side effects were statistically significant in the corticosteroid treatment groups, but were not considered important enough for treatment to be discontinued in these short-term studies.</P>
<P>Participants treated with prednisone 0.75 mg/kg/day over the six-month period were at significant risk of excessive hair growth. Participants and their families appear to have tolerated this side effect, which caused no participants to drop out of the study.</P>
<P>Combined data from <LINK REF="STD-Mendell-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Mendell 1989</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Griggs-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Griggs 1991</LINK> demonstrated more acne in the prednisone 0.75 mg/kg/day group during the six months of treatment compared to six months of placebo, but this difference was not statistically significant.</P>
<P>As the intermittent corticosteroid regimens are postulated to have a better adverse effect profile, we wanted to compare the daily dose regimen (studied in <LINK REF="STD-Mendell-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Mendell 1989</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Griggs-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Griggs 1991</LINK>, and <LINK REF="STD-Rahman-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Rahman 2001</LINK>) with the intermittent regimen (studied in <LINK REF="STD-Beenakker-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Beenakker 2005</LINK>). We were not able to make a comparison, as adverse effects data from the only RCT of intermittent prednisone were not available in a format that would allow statistical analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Beenakker-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Beenakker 2005</LINK>). In this six-month randomised, controlled, cross-over trial of intermittent prednisone (0.75 mg/kg/day for the first 10 days each month), increased appetite and behavioural side effects occurred more frequently during the prednisone period than during the placebo period, but these effects appear to have been mild, as they required no dose adjustment or drug discontinuation.</P>
<P>Only one included study reported a pathological fracture (of the tibia) while on corticosteroid (deflazacort 2 mg/per kg on alternate days) (<LINK REF="STD-Angelini-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Angelini 1994</LINK>). The report did not describe the duration of treatment prior to the occurrence of fracture or the circumstances of the fracture. One participant in the placebo treatment group in <LINK REF="STD-Griggs-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Griggs 1991</LINK> dropped out of the study because of an arm fracture (reported in <LINK REF="STD-Griggs-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Griggs 1993</LINK>).</P>
<P>None of the studies assessed bone mineral density by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scans. This relates to the age of most of the studies and their short-term nature. However, in view of the benefit of corticosteroid therapy in DMD, the treatment regimen is routinely continued in these patients over a decade or longer. In these circumstances, the development of osteoporosis is a major risk, and future studies should consider bone health assessment and systematic DEXA scanning in their protocol for adverse event monitoring (<LINK REF="REF-Biggar-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Biggar 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Quinlivan-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Quinlivan 2005</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Corticosteroid dose-response relationship</HEADING>
<P>Clinically, it is important to use the minimum effective dose of corticosteroid. To answer the question of what this may be, we reviewed the forest plots showing studies grouped according to dosage of prednisone/prednisolone. On the basis of the evidence available for analysis, our confidence in the effect estimate for prednisone/prednisolone at doses of 0.75 mg/kg/day is fairly secure. There is little evidence of an increase in benefit when the dose is further increased from 0.75 to 1.5 mg/kg daily (<LINK REF="STD-Mendell-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Mendell 1989</LINK>). This suggests that the daily dose regimen of 0.75 mg/kg/day is adequate to achieve what benefit prednisone can provide.</P>
<P>Differences in the proportion of boys experiencing hair growth and cushingoid features was significantly greater on a daily prednisone dose of 0.75 mg/kg/day than on 0.3 mg/kg/day, but the higher dose did not significantly increase rates of other common adverse events (<LINK REF="STD-Griggs-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Griggs 1991</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Mendell-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Mendell 1989</LINK> found no statistically significant increases in frequency of any adverse event when comparing 1.5 mg/kg/day with 0.75 mg/kg/day prednisone.</P>
<P>A proper investigation of the prednisone dose-response relationship to identify the optimum dose would need individual patient data within study analyses. We recommend that future studies make arrangements for provision of individual patient data for these analyses.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Co-interventions</HEADING>
<P>The co-interventions identified included daily calcium carbonate (<LINK REF="STD-Griggs-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Griggs 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mendell-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Mendell 1989</LINK>), antacids given routinely to all participants (<LINK REF="STD-Angelini-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Angelini 1994</LINK>), and dietetic advice to avoid weight gain (<LINK REF="STD-Angelini-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Angelini 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Griggs-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Griggs 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mendell-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Mendell 1989</LINK>). In <LINK REF="STD-Hu-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Hu 2015</LINK>, concomitant interventions included a calcium-rich diet, medications (vitamin D, calcium, ranitidine, over-the-counter antacid), a high protein, low carbohydrate, low fat diet, and respiratory, cardiac, and rehabilitative interventions (<LINK REF="STD-Hu-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Hu 2015</LINK>). These co-interventions, however, are clinically extremely unlikely to be responsible for the benefits observed. None of the studies assessed physical activity levels as a potentially confounding factor.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Escolar-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Escolar 2011</LINK> was the only published RCT of weekend-only versus daily prednisone. No appreciable difference was present in the primary outcomes of upper and lower limb strength or the safety outcome of body mass index (BMI) between the two groups at 12 months. We did find a difference with faster times to rise from the floor in the daily group, but no clear differences were seen for any other functional outcomes measured. The trial identified no clear difference in weight gain, as the result had wide confidence intervals that include the possibility of no benefit from weekend-only over daily treatment. The weekend-only treatment group had a larger increase in linear height.</P>

<P>Of the three RCTs of deflazacort versus prednisone, only <LINK REF="STD-Bonifati-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Bonifati 2000</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Karimzadeh-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Karimzadeh 2012</LINK> have been published in detail, while <LINK REF="STD-Brooke-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Brooke 1996</LINK> (n = 106) has been published only as an abstract. <LINK REF="STD-Bonifati-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Bonifati 2000</LINK> was a study with only 18 participants, comparing the adverse effects of prednisone with those of deflazacort, both given in a daily dose regimen over one year. The trialists did not present power calculations. The two corticosteroids demonstrated similar benefit on strength and functional tests, but the difference in weight gain was statistically significant, being more marked in the prednisone treatment group. One of the nine participants in the deflazacort group, in comparison to four of the nine in the prednisone group, experienced a weight gain of more than 20% over baseline. <LINK REF="STD-Karimzadeh-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Karimzadeh 2012</LINK> randomised 34 participants to either daily prednisone 0.75 mg/kg/day or daily deflazacort 0.9 mg/kg/day. After early dropouts the trial continued for 12 months with 26 participants. At 12 months there was no appreciable difference in motor function scores between the two drug regimens. There was a clear difference in weight gain combining data from the two trials, with the greatest gain seen in the prednisone group, although this evidence is very low quality.</P>

<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Pradhan-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Pradhan 2006</LINK> explored the possibility that daily prednisolone initiated in the late ambulant phase of DMD would delay loss of ambulation, while also aiming to shorten the period of corticosteroid exposure and thereby diminish adverse effects. The investigators calculated the power of this study to detect a significant difference between the control and treatment groups, not on the basis of time to loss of ambulation, but on muscle power. This open, controlled trial assessed the effect of prednisolone 0.75 mg/kg daily, started at a stage when the participants had started falling several times in a day. The investigators randomly allocated 67 serially seen boys into a prednisolone treatment group (44 participants, mean age 8.83 ± 1.25 years) or control group (23 participants, mean age 8.18 ± 0.64 years). Both groups also received vitamin E. The trialists followed up participants for two years, and thereafter until the boys reached a "chair bound stage". Of the 44 participants in the prednisolone treatment group, 24 dropped out because of adverse effects and treatment was stopped in a further five because of no improvement in power. Fifteen of the remaining 19 in the treatment group could be followed up regularly for two years, and then up to "chair bound stage"; only data from these 15 participants were used for comparison with the control group. <LINK REF="STD-Pradhan-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Pradhan 2006</LINK> reported that in this subgroup of 15, the mean age of becoming wheelchair-dependent was 169 ± 9 months compared to 132 ± 8 months in the control group. As the statistical analysis was based only on the 15 participants who responded without significant adverse effects, and does not take into account dropouts or non-responders in the prednisolone treatment group, we did not include <LINK REF="STD-Pradhan-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Pradhan 2006</LINK> in the review.</P>
<P>Though the trialists did not analyse the data in this study on an intention-to-treat basis, the results may be of clinical significance, as there appears to be a subgroup of boys with DMD who achieved prolongation of time to loss of ambulation by three years, without significant adverse effects. Caution is required in interpretation of these results as they cannot be generalised to the whole population of boys affected by DMD.</P>
<P>The variability in response to corticosteroid treatment amongst individuals affected by DMD in this and other studies, remains unexplained and is likely to be multifactorial. <LINK REF="STD-Bonifati-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Bonifati 2006</LINK> suggested glucocorticoid receptor polymorphisms to be one of the possible factors modulating the long-term response to corticosteroids.</P>

<P>Early, open studies aiming to document some benefit of corticosteroid therapy in DMD used prednisone in high doses ranging from 1.5 mg/kg/day to 5 mg/kg on alternate days (<LINK REF="STD-Brooke-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Brooke 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-DeSilva-1987" TYPE="STUDY">DeSilva 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Drachman-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Drachman 1974</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Siegel-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Siegel 1974</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-DeSilva-1987" TYPE="STUDY">DeSilva 1987</LINK>, an open study, used loss of ambulation as its primary endpoint and reported prolongation of walking by approximately two years. The adverse effects of corticosteroid treatment in this study were significant and included excessive weight gain, which occurred in the majority of the participants, and hyperactivity, cataracts, hypertension, and stress fractures. These initial studies led to RCTs and further open cohort studies to assess efficacy, and to find optimal dose regimens to minimise adverse effects (<LINK REF="STD-Griggs-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Griggs 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mendell-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Mendell 1989</LINK>).</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Fenichel-1991a" TYPE="STUDY">Fenichel 1991a</LINK> compared alternate-day dosing regimens of prednisone 1.25 mg/kg or 2.5 mg/kg over a six-month period.

The placebo group from <LINK REF="STD-Mendell-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Mendell 1989</LINK> received prednisone 1.25 mg/kg on alternate days; they improved in strength at three months of treatment, but showed a decline in strength over the subsequent three months. The participants in <LINK REF="STD-Mendell-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Mendell 1989</LINK> who were treated with prednisone 0.75 mg/kg/day or 1.5 mg/kg/day were changed to 2.5 mg/kg on alternate days for six months in <LINK REF="STD-Fenichel-1991a" TYPE="STUDY">Fenichel 1991a</LINK>; they showed a decline in muscle strength. Comparing the 1.25 mg/kg alternate day group of <LINK REF="STD-Fenichel-1991a" TYPE="STUDY">Fenichel 1991a</LINK> with the contemporaneous 2.5 mg/kg alternate day group, and also with the placebo control group of the previous <LINK REF="STD-Mendell-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Mendell 1989</LINK> study, the trial authors concluded that daily dose prednisone was more effective than the alternate-day regimen.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Yilmaz-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Yilmaz 2004</LINK> treated 66 boys with prednisolone 0.75 mg/kg on alternate days (plus vitamin D 600 to 1200 units/day) and compared this group with a control group of 22 boys who had been followed up in the same centre in the past ("pre-steroid era"). The controls were reportedly chosen at random, but no details were given regarding this process. Duration of follow-up was 2.75 ± 0.1 years. Age at loss of walking ability was 10.0 ± 1.5 (range 7 to 14) years in the prednisolone group, compared to 8.6 ± 2.6 (range 6 to 11) years in the control group. Amongst the prednisolone-treated boys, 14 walked independently beyond the age of 12 years and three beyond 13 years, but all lost the ability to walk by the end of 14 years of age. At the end of the study, none of the prednisolone treatment group developed scoliosis during the follow-up period (by a mean age 10.8 ± 1.2 years), whereas seven boys in the control group had scoliosis by a mean age of 11.7 ± 2 years.</P>

The registry includes prednisone use status as current, past, or never, but does not record details of dose regimen, age at commencement, duration, or side effects. The study authors considered 245 patients in the prednisone-treated group (171 current, 74 past), and 315 who had never been treated.

<LINK REF="STD-Henricson-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Henricson 2013</LINK> was a multicentre, international, prospective cohort study assessing 340 patients with DMD, ranging in age from 2 to 28 years, at three-monthly (ambulant) or six-monthly (non-ambulant) intervals. Participants were divided into three groups: 82 corticosteroid-naïve patients (never treated or treated for less than one month total), 210 current corticosteroid users, and 48 past corticosteroid users (treated for more than one month previously, but not currently receiving corticosteroids). The study authors did not specify the preparation of corticosteroid, the regimen (daily versus intermittent), and whether these were the same for all patients studied. They additionally considered and tabulated outcomes by age group. Main outcomes focused on ambulation and functional milestones: each visit attempted to assess timed tests for standing from supine, climbing four standard stairs, walking or running 10 metres, upper limb function (Brooke scale), and lower limb function (Vignos). Over the age of six years, current corticosteroid users consistently demonstrated greater functional abilities than past users or naïve patients. Past users had less ability than current users, but performed better than the naïve group. None of the naïve boys walked beyond age 12, compared to the 8% of past users and 45% of current users still able to walk independently between 13 and 15 years of age. In 16- to 18-year-olds, only in the group currently taking corticosteroids were any members ambulant (12%). In the upper limbs, 37% of current corticosteroid users, aged 18 years or above, could still lift hand to mouth to feed independently, compared to none of the past user or corticosteroid-naïve groups. MRC manual muscle testing (MMT) scores did not significantly differ between the corticosteroid-treated group and the cohort as a whole. Pulmonary function as measured by FVC and FEV<SUB>1</SUB> (forced expiratory volume in one second) was comparatively better in the corticosteroid-treated group between the ages of 10 to 15 years. In terms of bone health, the trial authors reported a similar incidence of fractures between corticosteroid-users and the other groups among those more than 13 years old, although the need for surgical spinal stabilisation was reduced in the corticosteroid group between the ages of 13 and 15 years.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Biggar-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Biggar 2001</LINK> used a starting dose of deflazacort 0.9 mg/kg daily in 30 boys with DMD (age 7 to 15 years) over 3.8 years (SD 1.5) and compared this group with 24 boys who were followed up at the same clinic contemporaneously, who did not take up the option of deflazacort treatment because of parental choice (most commonly, fear of side effects). Seven of the 30 boys in the deflazacort group stopped walking at a mean of 12.3 (SD 2.7) years, and this contrasted with the non-treated participants, all 24 of whom stopped walking at a mean of 9.8 (SD 1.8) years. The FVC in the deflazacort-treated group was significantly greater at 15 years (P &lt; 0.001), but the trial authors did not report the number of participants at 15 years. Ten of the 30 boys in the deflazacort treatment group developed asymptomatic cataracts. The two groups were significantly different in height; mean height in the deflazacort-treated group continued along the 3rd centile, compared to mean height between the 25th and 50th centiles for the non-treated group.</P>
<P>The primary outcome of interest in <LINK REF="STD-Silversides-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Silversides 2003</LINK> was cardiac function. The trialists reported a cohort of 33 Duchenne patients who underwent echocardiographic evaluation. Twenty-one participants had been on deflazacort, for a mean duration of 5.1 years ± 2.4, and trialists compared this group with the other 12 who had not accepted the option of deflazacort treatment. The mean age at final follow-up was 14 (± 2) years for the deflazacort-treated group and 16 (± 2) years for the non-treated group. This age difference in the two groups was not statistically significant (P = 0.08), but the biological significance cannot be discounted. Cardiomyopathy, as indicated by left ventricular ejection fraction less than 45%, was demonstrated in only one of the 21 deflazacort-treated participants, compared to seven out of 12 non-treated participants (P = 0.001). The mean ejection fraction reduction was 33% (± 7) in the deflazacort group and 21% (± 8) in the non-treated group (P = 0.002).</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Alman-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Alman 2004</LINK> focused on the development of scoliosis in the cohort of 54 boys followed up at the Bloorview Macmillan Centre and initially reported in <LINK REF="STD-Biggar-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Biggar 2001</LINK>. The mean age at follow-up was 16 years. Only five of the 30 deflazacort-treated boys developed scoliosis of more than 20°. In comparison, 16 of the 24 untreated boys developed scoliosis of more than 20°. Deflazacort treatment was associated not only with a reduced incidence of scoliosis, but also delayed the onset and/or development of scoliosis; of the boys who developed scoliosis of &gt; 20°, the five deflazacort-treated boys required spinal surgery at a later age of 15.1 ± 2.0 years, compared with the 16 non-treated boys who underwent spinal surgery at 12.9 ± 2.4 years.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Biggar-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Biggar 2006</LINK> reported the updated and cumulative results of the overlapping cohorts from <LINK REF="STD-Alman-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Alman 2004</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Biggar-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Biggar 2001</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Biggar-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Biggar 2004</LINK>. and <LINK REF="STD-Silversides-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Silversides 2003</LINK>. The included participants were 74 boys with DMD between 10 and 18 years old who could co-operate for reproducible muscle and pulmonary function testing and were followed up in Neuromuscular Clinics, Toronto, Canada between January 1990 and December 2004. (Investigators excluded four boys who stopped taking deflazacort within two to three years, before they were 10 years old; they are not included in these 74 patients). Boys were offered deflazacort treatment while they were still ambulant but had clinical evidence of worsening muscle function, as evidenced by frequent falls and difficulty in rising from the floor or climbing stairs. Of the 74 boys, 40 were treated with deflazacort; the remaining 34 who did not accept deflazacort (mainly due to fear of side effects, or family cultural or religious reasons) were used as the comparison group. Boys treated with deflazacort (and most boys not treated with deflazacort) received oral daily supplements of vitamin D (1000 units) and calcium (750 mg). Mean age at starting deflazacort was 7.7 ± 1.2 years. The deflazacort starting dose was 0.9 mg/kg daily, which gradually declined over the years as boys grew and gained weight, or was reduced because of side effects. By 10 years of age, the mean dose was 0.8 ± 0.18 mg/kg/day, by 15 years it was 0.55 ± 0.09 mg/kg/day, and by 18 years 0.5 ± 0.2 mg/kg/day. Mean age at the end of the study period was 15.2 ± 2.7 years in the deflazacort-treated group and 15.2 ± 2.5 years in the non-treated group. Mean time on deflazacort was 5.5 years. The key results are listed as follows.<BR/>
<I>
<BR/>Walking (10 metres)</I>: In the deflazacort-treated group, 25 of 31 (81%) could walk at 12 years, 13 of 17 (76%) at 15 years, and two of six boys walked independently at 18 years. By contrast, all 34 boys not treated stopped walking by 12 years of age (mean age 9.8 ± 1.8 years).</P>
<P>
<I>Scoliosis</I>: Scoliosis is a frequent complication of DMD in the second decade of life, occurring in up to 90% of affected boys, and in the huge majority, is clinically evident in the 13 to 15 year age group. In the <LINK REF="STD-Biggar-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Biggar 2006</LINK> cohort, by 18 years of age (mean 13.8 ±1.6 years), 30 of 34 (90%) boys who were not treated developed a spinal curve of more than 20°. In contrast, only four of 40 (10%) deflazacort-treated boys developed scoliosis of more than 20° during the study period. The possible explanations for this could be deflazacort-related prolongation of the ambulatory phase, improvement in paraspinal and truncal muscle strength, or both.</P>
<P>
<I>Cardiac function</I>: Moderate or severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction (ejection fraction below 45%) was noted in only four out of 40 boys in the deflazacort-treated group as compared with 20 of 34 boys in the not treated group.</P>
<P>
<I>Pulmonary function</I>: FVC, reported as per cent predicted (for age and height) (FVC-PP), was remarkably preserved in the deflazacort treated group. Both groups of boys, treated and untreated, were reported to have similar FVC-PP before 10 years of age, but the report did not present the data. As anticipated, in line with the natural history of DMD, in the no treatment group, FVC-PP showed a gradual decline with age (65 ± 13% at 10 years, 47 ± 19% at 15 years, and 34 ± 10% at 18 years). In contrast, in the deflazacort-treated group, the FVC-PP was 95 ± 17% at 10 years, 88 ± 12% at 15 years, and 81 ± 13% at 18 years. The clinically-important implication was that by 18 years of age, 46% of the boys not treated required nocturnal ventilatory support, compared to none in the deflazacort-treated group.</P>
<P>
<I>Survival</I>: To our knowledge, <LINK REF="STD-Biggar-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Biggar 2006</LINK> was the first study reporting the impact of corticosteroid therapy on survival in DMD. Twelve of the 34 (35%) boys not treated died at mean age 17.6 ± 1.7 years, of cardiorespiratory complications (details not reported). Only two of the 40 deflazacort-treated boys died; cause of death was left ventricular failure, and age at death was 13 years and 18 years.</P>
<P>
<I>Adverse events</I>: The growth suppression effect of long-term glucocorticoid treatment was evident in short stature in the deflazacort-treated group; at age 15 years, the height of deflazacort-treated boys was 143 ± 9 cm, compared to 164 ± 8 cm for boys not treated. Twenty-two of the 40 deflazacort-treated boys developed bilateral cataracts, though they were asymptomatic for the duration of the study.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Biggar-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Biggar 2006</LINK> gave dietary recommendations to all boys on each hospital visit, and referred boys to a nutritionist if weight exceeded expected weight by 5% to 10%, or if weight loss exceeded 10%. With this approach, excessive weight gain, which is a common side effect of corticosteroid therapy, was not noted to be a significant clinical problem amongst these 40 deflazacort-treated boys, over a mean treatment period of five years. Trialists reported only one boy from the Bloorview Macmillan Centre to have discontinued deflazacort because of excessive weight gain, and this boy was not included in the 74 participants reported in <LINK REF="STD-Biggar-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Biggar 2006</LINK>. Three boys in the deflazacort-treated group developed fragility vertebral fractures compared with none in the non-treated group. Long-bone fractures were documented in 25% of boys in both groups, with no difference between groups.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Houde-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Houde 2008</LINK> retrospectively analysed the medical charts of 105 boys with DMD over an eight-year period. The boys were divided into those receiving deflazacort for more than one year (treated) and those not receiving the drug or who had received it for less than six months (untreated). The trialists excluded five boys in the treated group; four because they had stopped taking the drug after two years, and one because he had received prednisone for six years before switching to deflazacort. Among the untreated group, they excluded 21 because of missing data or because boys were too young to participate in all regular assessments. Overall, 37 boys received deflazacort, and 42 were untreated. The starting dose was 0.9 mg/kg/day, adjusted according to progression or side effects, with a maximum of 1 mg/kg. The mean length of treatment was 66 months, with 70% taking deflazacort for more than five years, and 22% for more than eight years. The mean age on beginning treatment was 7.6 ± 1.7 years and the mean dose at the most recent clinic visit recorded was 0.69 ± 0.2 mg/kg. All boys, treated and untreated, were offered review every three months. The mean age of the treated group was 13.1 ± 3.2 years. Among the untreated patients, 24 were over 18 and no longer actively followed at the clinic. Of the 18 who were still under regular clinic review, the mean age was 9.5 ± 2.9 years. Key findings were as follows.</P>
<P>
<I>Ambulation</I>: The trialists reported loss of ambulation as when a boy could no longer walk, even with help. For those who used long leg braces, it was recorded as the time when natural walking stopped or when the use of braces began. Twelve of 37 boys in the treated group had lost ambulation at a mean age of 11.5 ± 1.9 years, compared with 32/42, mean age of 9.6 ± 1.4 years (P &lt; 0.05) in the untreated group. Of boys aged 12 years or more, 13/23 (53%) of the treated group could still walk compared to none of the untreated group.</P>
<P>
<I>Muscle strength</I>: MRC score of 34 muscles was recorded every six months. Scores were cumulated and converted to a percentage of normal (where 100% = normal). Muscle strength at age 16 was 63% ± 4 in the treated group compared to 31% ± 3 in the untreated group, P &lt; 0.003.</P>
<P>
<I>FVC</I>: The treated group improved in FVC: 66% ± 14 treated versus 48% ± 22 untreated, P &lt; 0.007.</P>
<P>
<I>Cardiac function</I>: The deflazacort group improved in cardiac function, with significantly better values for fractional shortening and ejection fraction, and a lower incidence of dilated cardiomyopathy. Of note, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors were used more frequently in the treated group but their effect could not be isolated from those of deflazacort. The older age of the untreated group may also have biased the incidence of cardiomyopathy.</P>
<P>
<I>Scoliosis development</I>: Fewer boys developed scoliosis in the treated group 10/37 (27%) than in the untreated group 28/42 (67%). Scoliosis when it did occur also tended to be less severe; none of the treated boys required corrective surgery in the treated group, compared with 12/28 (43%) of the untreated group.</P>
<P>
<I>Adverse events</I>: All adverse events were more common in the treated group. Fractures occurred in both groups, with a similar incidence of long-bone fractures (24% treated group, 26% untreated group) but the incidence of vertebral fractures was greater in the treated group (20% versus 0%), although none contributed to any functional decline. Nineteen of the 37 participants in the treated group required bisphosphonates compared with none in the untreated group. Excess weight (BMI &gt; 85% percentile) was present in both groups; 13/21 (62%) of the treated group versus 6/11 (55%) of the untreated group. Evidence of growth suppression and short stature was also seen in the treated group, with mean height gain being three times as much in the untreated group at age 12 years. Height values were not available for all children and some were younger than 12 years old, but the available data showed that only 3/20 (15%) of the treated group grew 4 cm per year or more, compared to 19/19 of the untreated group at age 12. Cataracts developed in 18/37 (49%) of the treated group; in 17 of 18 (94%) this was after more than five years of treatment. One patient required surgery.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Studies comparing deflazacort with prednisone daily dose regimens</HEADING>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Balaban-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Balaban 2005</LINK> reported a retrospective study of the long-term effect of daily dose corticosteroids in a cohort of 49 boys with DMD between the ages of 12 and 15 years. Eighteen boys were treated with prednisone, 12 with deflazacort, and 19 had no treatment. Parents had been informed about treatment alternatives and were offered the option of corticosteroid medication, and the choice of deflazacort or prednisone. The study site was in Denver, Colorado, USA; the authors report that the cost of deflazacort was much greater than prednisone (USD 3 per day versus USD 0.50 per day), and some families chose on the basis of cost.</P>
<P>The mean age of starting deflazacort was 7.45 ± 0.97 years, mean duration of treatment was 5.85 ± 1.5 years, and the starting dose was 0.9 mg/kg/day. The mean age of starting prednisone was 6.90 ± 1.0 years, mean duration of treatment 5.49 ± 1.98 years, and the starting dose 0.75 mg/kg/day. The benefits, including prolongation of the ability to walk 30 feet on level ground, were similar in groups treated with deflazacort or prednisone, as compared to the untreated boys. Excessive weight gain was more common in prednisone-treated boys, leading to discontinuation of prednisone in three of the 18 boys in this group. Two of the 12 deflazacort-treated boys developed asymptomatic cataracts.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Dubowitz regimen - prednisolone 10 days on, 10/20 days off</HEADING>
<P>In order to lessen the adverse effects of long-term corticosteroid treatment, Dubowitz recommended an intermittent regimen of prednisolone 0.75 mg/kg/day for the first 10 days of every calendar month (treatment cycles of 10 days on prednisolone, 20 days off; <LINK REF="REF-Dubowitz-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dubowitz 1991</LINK>). An open study of 32 patients demonstrated that this intermittent regimen had a positive influence on strength at six months, followed by a slow decline at 12 and 18 months (<LINK REF="STD-Sansome-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Sansome 1993</LINK>); weight gain and other side effects were much less than would be expected with continuous therapy. Subsequently, to increase efficacy, the investigators modified the regimen to a 10 days on prednisolone 0.75 mg/kg/day and 10 days off treatment cycle. The same research group highlighted the long-term tolerability of the intermittent (10 days on treatment, 10 days off) regimen of prednisolone (<LINK REF="STD-Dubowitz-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Dubowitz 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kinali-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Kinali 2002</LINK>). The four boys reported in these studies were started on prednisolone between four and five years of age, and followed up over a period of between 3.75 and over five years. These boys showed "remarkable improvement" (described by authors as gaining the ability to rise from the floor without Gowers' manoeuvre, hop on one or both legs, and run without waddle) and the functional benefit was partly sustained without the evidence of abnormal weight gain, demineralisation of bone, or other signs of chronic prednisolone toxicity. These studies, though including small numbers, also suggested that the beneficial effects of corticosteroids appear to be greater when treatment is initiated at a younger age, in the early ambulant phase (<LINK REF="STD-Dubowitz-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Dubowitz 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kinali-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Kinali 2002</LINK>). No long-term data exist reporting prolongation of ambulation with this intermittent regimen.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Kinali-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Kinali 2007</LINK> retrospectively analysed predictive factors for development of scoliosis in DMD in 123 DMD boys, aged 17 years or older. Thirty-seven of the 123 boys (30%) had received intermittent prednisolone (0.75 mg/kg/day, 10 consecutive days/month) for a median time of one year (two months to nine years), starting between 7.7 and 12.4 years (mean 9.5 years). The study authors used univariate analysis to relate age at onset of scoliosis and scoliosis severity at 17 years with glucocorticoid treatment and other factors. There was a positive relationship between age at scoliosis onset (later) and duration (longer) of prednisolone treatment (r = 0.44, P = 0.01, n = 36). Severity of scoliosis at 17 years and duration of prednisolone treatment showed no relationship (P = 0.64). The intermittent prednisolone regimen in <LINK REF="STD-Kinali-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Kinali 2007</LINK> appeared to be associated with a later onset of scoliosis; the trial author concluded that the observation of unchanged scoliosis severity at 17 years probably reflected the shorter overall glucocorticoid exposure in this cohort.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Parreira-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Parreira 2007</LINK> "sought to select a sequence of tests which can be applied in a practical and swift fashion in an outpatient setting to assess patients' response to steroid therapy" and reported its application to 32 boys with DMD who were treated with intermittent prednisolone (0.75 mg/kg/day in an intermittent course of 10 days on, 10 days off), or deflazacort (1 mg/kg/day). The trialists did not report the number of boys using prednisolone or deflazacort regimens. Age range at the start of treatment was 5 years 8 months to 8 years 8 months, and the boys were assessed on 10 visits, monthly for the first six months and then every two months until the 14-month end point. Of the 26 boys who complied with the medication and assessment regimen, eight lost ambulation during the study period. The benefit appeared modest. Over the 14-month period, muscle strength assessment showed worsening of MRC indices, but there was a statistically significant improvement in weight lifting test results (P &lt; 0.001), and improvement in time taken to walk nine metres. The data presented did not allow comparison of the effect of intermittent prednisolone with that of daily dose deflazacort. The study authors did not describe adverse effects. <LINK REF="STD-Parreira-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Parreira 2007</LINK> emphasised that muscle strength measurements alone are not sufficient for evaluating the results of corticosteroid treatment, and that tests analysing function and execution should also be performed.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Connolly regimen - twice weekly prednisolone (5 mg/kg/dose)</HEADING>
<P>In a further attempt to decrease long-term adverse effects, <LINK REF="STD-Connolly-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Connolly 2002</LINK> devised a twice-weekly regimen of prednisone given every Friday and Saturday (5 mg/kg/dose). Twenty treated boys (with an average age of eight years) were compared to historical controls. Strength, evaluated with hand-held manometer and grip meter, improved over six to 12 months. At least six of the 20 boys developed irritability, which led to discontinuation of treatment in two, and a 25% to 30% dose reduction in four patients. Long-term results for this treatment regimen have not been reported.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Nigro regimen - Deflazacort 0.6 mg/kg/day 20 days on, 10 days off</HEADING>
<P>Professor Nigro's group in Naples, Italy, who studied 56 boys, utilised this intermittent regimen of deflazacort; <LINK REF="STD-Biggar-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Biggar 2004</LINK> reported the results, and compared them with the daily dose deflazacort regimen used in 32 of 60 boys in Toronto, Canada. (The Toronto patients were part of the overlapping patient cohorts described in <LINK REF="STD-Alman-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Alman 2004</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Biggar-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Biggar 2001</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Bonifati-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Bonifati 2006</LINK>, and <LINK REF="STD-Silversides-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Silversides 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>In Professor Nigro's Naples group, 56 boys at mean age 6.0 ± 1.5 years, were started on the intermittent regimen of deflazacort 0.6 mg/kg given on the first 20 days of each month. Nineteen of the 56 stopped deflazacort within one month because of "economical and/or environmental reasons", and they served as a control group for comparison. The deflazacort-treated boys were also given daily supplements of vitamin D (880 iu) and calcium (1000 mg). Duration of deflazacort treatment was more than four years in all boys.</P>
<P>In the control group of 19 boys from Naples, Italy, only four (21%) were able to walk 10 metres at nine years and none at 12 years. Of the 37 boys treated with intermittent deflazacort (0.6 mg/kg/day for the first 20 days of each month), 97% (36/37) could walk 10 metres at nine years, 35% (9/26) at 12 years and 25% (3/12) at 15 years. This represents significant improvement in comparison to the previous natural history studies, which reported loss of walking in untreated boys with DMD at mean ages of 8.8 years (<LINK REF="REF-Dubowitz-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dubowitz 1978</LINK>), 9.5 years (<LINK REF="REF-Gardner_x002d_Medwin-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gardner-Medwin 1980</LINK>), and 10.5 years (<LINK REF="REF-Allsop-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Allsop 1981</LINK>). However, in comparison, the daily dose deflazacort 0.9 mg/kg/day regimen used to treat the 32 boys in Toronto, Canada, appears to have a bigger impact on walking; all 32 were able to walk 10 metres at 9 years, 83% (19/23) at 12 years, and 77% (10/33) at 15 years. The key difference in side effects was with regards to cataracts. No cataracts were noted in the 37 patients treated with the intermittent 20 days on, 10 days off Nigro regimen, compared with the 30% who developed asymptomatic cataracts among 32 patients treated with daily dose deflazacort.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Long-term studies comparing daily prednisolone with intermittent prednisolone (10 days on, 10 days off)</HEADING>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Ricotti-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Ricotti 2013</LINK> was an observational study utilising longitudinal clinical data entered into the UK North Star database from 17 participating paediatric neuromuscular centres. The investigators analysed data on 360 boys (age range 3 to 17 years) who had received prednisolone (191 on an intermittent regimen of 10 days on, 10 days off, and 169 on a daily dose regimen). The mean duration of treatment and follow-up was 3.9 years. The median time to loss of ambulation was 12 years in the intermittent treatment group and 14.5 years in the daily treatment group; the hazard ratio (HR) for intermittent treatment was 1.57 (95% CI 0.87 to 2.82). Longitudinal analysis of the North Star Ambulatory Assessment (a validated composite scale to measure function in ambulant DMD boys) showed a faster rate of decline after age seven in those on the intermittent versus the daily regimen, with the difference between the two regimens increasing by 1.58 units per year (95% CI 1.04 to 2.11, P &lt; 0.001), although respiratory and cardiac outcomes did not differ between the two groups. Side effects were more common in the daily treatment group, including cushingoid features (33% versus 15%), hyperactivity (23% versus 15%), and hypertension (22% versus 5%). Both groups gained excessive weight. The daily group had a lower mean height, MD 1.09 (95% CI 0.78 to 1.40, P &lt; 0.001). Overall increase in BMI was greatest in the daily treatment group: MD 0.43 (95% CI 0.11 to 0.74, P &lt; 0.01). <LINK REF="STD-Ricotti-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Ricotti 2013</LINK> reported vertebral fractures (vertebral wedging on lateral spine radiography) in 4% of boys on the intermittent regimen and 8% of boys on the daily regimen.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Markham-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Markham 2005</LINK> reported cross-sectional echocardiographic shortening fraction data in a retrospective review of 111 subjects with DMD who had been followed up in two centres. Forty-eight subjects had been treated (29 with prednisolone, 19 with deflazacort) for six months or longer, and they were compared with the 63 untreated subjects. The dose regimen was not reported. Age range was three to 11 years (treated 11 ± 4, untreated 12 ± 5), and mean length of treatment was 3 ± 2.5 years. Of the 48 treated subjects, 10 had been treated with corticosteroids for 4.2 ± 1.6 years, but the treatment had been stopped because of adverse effects at the time of echocardiography.</P>
<P>The shortening fraction was lower in the untreated group than in the corticosteroid-treated group (30% ± 7% versus 36% ± 5%; P &lt; 0.001). The difference in shortening fraction between the two groups was most obvious in subjects over 10 years of age: in comparison with the corticosteroid-treated subjects, the untreated subjects older than 10 years were 15 times more likely to have a shortening fraction less than 28% (P &lt; 0.01). Though the two groups were similar with regards to baseline age, body mass and left ventricular indices, the retrospective design of this study carries the implicit risk of biased treatment allocation.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Daftary-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Daftary 2007</LINK> studied 10 corticosteroid-treated and 25 non-treated patients in a retrospective case-control study. The age range of the treated group was seven to 21 years (median 10 years). Three patients were treated exclusively with prednisone, five exclusively with deflazacort, and two were started on intermittent prednisone but later switched to daily deflazacort. Prednisone was started at a dosage of 0.75 mg/kg/day and deflazacort at 0.9 mg/kg/day. The mean duration of corticosteroid therapy was 8.2 years (range 1 to 14 years). Peak cough flow (PCF) and maximum expiratory pressure were significantly higher in the corticosteroid-treated group. Median PCF was 215.0 L/min in the treated group compared with 177.5 L/min in the non-treated group (P &#8804; 0.05). Median maximum expiratory pressure (MEP) was 62.5 cm H<SUB>2</SUB>O in the treated group as compared with 44.5 cm H<SUB>2</SUB>O in the non-treated group (P &#8804; 0.05). These results are suggestive that corticosteroid therapy is beneficial in preserving respiratory muscle strength and cough efficiency in DMD, and are in concordance with previous randomised (<LINK REF="STD-Griggs-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Griggs 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mendell-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Mendell 1989</LINK>) and non-randomised studies (<LINK REF="STD-Biggar-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Biggar 2006</LINK>), which reported preservation of FVC. Of note, <LINK REF="STD-Daftary-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Daftary 2007</LINK> observed that patients with DMD were weak and therefore often unable to sustain exhalation for six seconds, as required by the American Thoracic Society to meet pulmonary function test acceptability criteria, and arbitrarily chose a three second (or more) exhalation criterion for acceptability. This indicates the need for consensus on customisation of the test protocols, taking into consideration the marked respiratory muscle weakness in DMD.</P>
<P>In this update we did not select any further non-randomised studies selectively focusing on cough efficiency and respiratory muscle strength as these outcomes are not the primary focus of this review. A Cochrane review of Mechanical insufflation-exsufflation for people with neuromuscular disorders has been published (<LINK REF="REF-Morrow-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morrow 2013</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Vertebral fractures with daily dose corticosteroid regimens</HEADING>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Bothwell-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Bothwell 2003</LINK> highlighted the need for caution with the long-term use of corticosteroids. Twenty-five boys with DMD were treated with daily corticosteroids (one prednisolone, 13 deflazacort, and 11 prednisolone before switching to deflazacort) for a median duration of 4.5 years (inter-quartile range (IQR) 3 to 10 years). The dosage used was 1 mg/kg/day. The trial authors do not describe whether the dose was reduced over time, for example in response to excessive weight gain. All boys were prescribed calcium supplements and 22 of the 25 boys were also on vitamin D. Ten of the 25 boys (40%) sustained vertebral fractures; eight were symptomatic with backache and two had fractures detected on spinal radiographs taken because of low bone mineral density results. The first fracture occurred 40 months into treatment. Extrapolating from the 10 boys who sustained a vertebral fracture, Kaplan-Meier analysis predicted that 50% of treated boys would have a vertebral fracture by 53.5 months, and 75% by 100 months of treatment.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-King-2007" TYPE="STUDY">King 2007</LINK> reported vertebral and long-bone fractures among 75 boys in the course of long-term daily dose corticosteroid treatment, comparing them with 68 boys who had not been treated or had received brief submaximal doses. The mean age of treated boys was 16.9 ± 5.6 years (range 6.1 to 30.5 years) compared to 14.4 ± 8.1 years (range 1.1 to 39.6 years) in the non-treated group. Thirty-six boys were treated with prednisone, 25 with deflazacort, and 14 had been on both. The daily dose regimen starting dose was prednisone 0.75 mg/kg/day or deflazacort 0.9 mg/kg/day. At the final clinic visit prior to data collation, the average corticosteroid dose of the treated group was 0.55 mg/kg (range 0.10 to 0.78 mg/kg). The mean duration of corticosteroid treatment was 8.04 years (± 5.2 years, range 0.5 to 18.5 years). The boys who began treatment were also prescribed calcium supplements, either as calcium carbonate 350 mg three times daily or a calcium tablet with vitamin D supplement (750 to 1200 mg daily), but the trialists did not report the degree of compliance with these supplements. Treated boys walked independently 3.3 years longer, had lower prevalence (31% versus 91%) and severity (Cobb angle 11&#730; versus 33&#730;) of scoliosis as compared to the non-treated boys, but 32% of these 75 corticosteroid-treated boys developed a compression vertebral fracture. Eighty per cent of vertebral fractures were identified incidentally during routine scoliosis screening radiographs, and not because of patient complaint. Vertebral fractures were reported not to be a motivation for discontinuing corticosteroids. Vertebral compression fractures are not a feature in the natural history of DMD, and none were found in the 68 non-treated boys in this study (<LINK REF="STD-King-2007" TYPE="STUDY">King 2007</LINK>). A higher percentage of corticosteroid-treated boys experienced long-bone fractures, with a risk 2.6 times greater than boys on no treatment. Whether the long-bone fractures were more frequent in the boys who suffered vertebral fractures was not reported, and how these complications might best be prevented or treated was not discussed. The percentage of vertebral fractures with a long-term intermittent, versus a daily prednisolone regimen is discussed above.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Controversy in clinical role of corticosteroids in DMD</HEADING>
<P>The 124th European Neuromuscular Centre (ENMC) International Workshop on treatment of DMD agreed "that the evidence for the use of daily steroids in DMD is now established and that trials of other treatments should be against this 'gold standard'" (<LINK REF="REF-Bushby-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bushby 2004</LINK>). The Quality Standards Subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology and the Practice Committee of the Child Neurology Society recommended that boys with DMD should be offered prednisone (at a dose of 0.75 mg/kg/day) as treatment, and that "the offer of treatment with corticosteroids should include a balanced discussion of potential risks" (<LINK REF="REF-Moxley-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moxley 2005</LINK>) . <LINK REF="REF-Dubowitz-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dubowitz 2005</LINK> expressed concern regarding the adverse effects of long-term daily dose corticosteroid treatment and concluded, "What is now urgently needed is a prospective, collaborative, multicentre, comparative study of the time-honoured, and somewhat entrenched, daily regimen against some of the alternative schedules, in order to compare both efficacy and side-effects". He further recommended that "in the meantime, paediatricians as well as parents should be offered the choice of either the continuous or the intermittent schedule. Hopefully we shall not be having the same debate in another 10 years time".</P>
<P>For this review we were only able to identify one RCT comparing daily with intermittent prednisolone regimens over a 12-month period (<LINK REF="STD-Escolar-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Escolar 2011</LINK>). This study, performed in boys with a mean age of 7.3 years, found no difference in efficacy between the regimens or overall side effect profile, with the notable exception of greater weight gain and lower linear height in the daily treatment group. A non-randomised longitudinal study over four years demonstrated consistent findings in terms of weight and height but also a divergence in efficacy for time to loss of ambulation and functional ability, favouring a daily regimen after the age of seven years. In this study, other side effects, including hypertension, were also more common on the daily regimen. Overall, the long-term (more than 12 months) risk/benefit ratio of daily versus intermittent prednisolone regimens remains unclear.</P>
<P>The FOR-DMD Study is currently open and aims to find the optimum corticosteroid regimen for DMD (<LINK REF="STD-Guglieri-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Guglieri 2015</LINK>). It is an international trial enrolling patients at 40 sites in five countries, randomising them to one of three regimens: daily prednisolone, daily deflazacort or intermittent prednisolone (10 days on and 10 days off). It aims to follow participants for three to five years and may address remaining questions over the long-term outcomes of intermittent regimens.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Costs</HEADING>
<P>The oral corticosteroids, including prednisone/prednisolone and deflazacort are not expensive. In the United Kingdom, the annual cost of prednisolone (soluble tablets) for a 30 kg boy is estimated at GBP 133 and the corresponding figure for deflazacort at the equivalent dosage of 0.9 mg/kg/day is GBP 480 (<LINK REF="REF-BNF-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">BNF 2016</LINK>). The much bigger costs are those for drug administration and the surveillance required to monitor both benefits and adverse effects, and these have not been calculated. The issue of cost should not be underestimated, as in countries where the parent or patient has to buy medication, cost of the corticosteroid preparation may force the patient's choice in favour of the cheaper drug (<LINK REF="STD-Balaban-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Balaban 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>The major aim of corticosteroids in the ambulant phase of DMD is to prolong the ability to walk. In the natural course of DMD, loss of walking ability at the mean age of 9.5 years (range 6 to 13) is followed by development of scoliosis, which is rapidly progressive during pubertal growth spurt years. This complication requires treatment with bracing, surgery, or both. Scoliosis and its treatment have implications for patients' quality of life and involve anaesthetic hazards and the surgical risks of extensive spine surgery. Data from non-randomised studies suggest that prolongation of ambulation, either with rehabilitation in calipers (<LINK REF="REF-Rodillo-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rodillo 1988</LINK>), or pharmacologically with prednisolone (<LINK REF="STD-Tunca-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Tunca 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yilmaz-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Yilmaz 2004</LINK>), or deflazacort (<LINK REF="STD-Biggar-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Biggar 2006</LINK>), reduces the risk of development and progression of scoliosis. The decrease in incidence and severity of scoliosis in corticosteroid-treated individuals has been postulated in part to the possible increase in paraspinal/axial muscle strength (<LINK REF="REF-Muntoni-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Muntoni 2006</LINK>). A decrease in incidence of scoliosis and avoidance of scoliosis surgery as a result of corticosteroid therapy would reduce the financial cost of managing these patients, but evidence for this from randomised studies is lacking. The same optimism and caution can be extended to respiratory and cardiac complications of DMD.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2016-04-29 18:22:40 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="KLJ ">
<P>DMD has a uniform course with regards to evolution of motor and function disabilities. Most of the participants in the included studies were between eight and 15 years old. There were not enough data available to stratify the participants according to age and to observe the response to corticosteroids in relation to age. Future updates could consider subgroup analysis by genotype or phenotype, although trials may be too small for this to be possible.</P>
<P>Data from the included studies and the non-randomised and cohort studies converge in suggesting a similar improvement in response to corticosteroids in DMD. It is very likely that the results are applicable to all boys with DMD, especially in their ambulant phase. We would not anticipate that in non-ambulant, wheelchair-dependent patients with DMD who have been corticosteroid-naïve in the past, corticosteroid treatment would restore the ability to walk. However, the benefit to upper limbs, cardiac and respiratory function remains a possibility, and this area needs further study.</P>
<P>The option of treatment with corticosteroids should be discussed in detail with the carers of ambulant boys with DMD. It would be prudent to undertake this treatment only in centres with expertise and facilities for comprehensive multidisciplinary pre-treatment assessment and regular long-term monitoring of benefits and adverse effects. Protocols of management, with close monitoring for adverse effects and adjustment of corticosteroid dose would be an essential prerequisite for patient safety.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Corticosteroids versus placebo</HEADING>
<P>Trials included in the meta-analyses for this comparison provided moderate quality evidence for effectiveness outcomes (muscle strength and functional tests) (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>). We downgraded the quality of evidence once because the risk of allocation bias was unclear in all studies that provided data for the analyses and for potential publication bias. Removal of a trial at high risk of bias did not substantially change the results of meta-analyses. Two studies were not fully published or did not report results in a form suitable for reporting (<LINK REF="STD-Brooke-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Brooke 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Todorovic-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Todorovic 1998</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-B_x00e4_ckman-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Bäckman 1995</LINK> provided only adverse event data.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Angelini-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Angelini 1994</LINK> was a small two-year study (n = 28) with design limitations, and a very high dropout rate at two years. Although the trial assessed prolongation of ambulation, the statistical technique used to analyse the data was not appropriate. The change in MRC index favoured deflazacort over placebo at two years, but timed function test results at 24 months were very imprecise, allowing for the possibility of effects in either direction.</P>

<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Escolar-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Escolar 2011</LINK> (n = 64) was a year-long equivalence trial comparing weekend-only and daily dosing of prednisone. We judged the study to be at a low risk of bias other than for attrition and reporting bias. Results were very imprecise, producing a low quality of evidence for manual muscle testing (MMT), body mass index (BMI) and behavioural change. As CI fell within equivalence limits for muscle strength measured by quantitative muscle testing (QMT), 10-metre walk and four-stair climb, we considered the quality of evidence for these outcomes moderate (<LINK REF="SOF-02" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 2</LINK>).</P>

<P>For all assessed outcomes, the evidence comparing prednisone with deflazacort at one year was very low quality (<LINK REF="SOF-03" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 3</LINK>). Two newly included studies comparing different corticosteroids did not fully report data, making only limited analysis possible (<LINK REF="STD-Bonifati-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Bonifati 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Karimzadeh-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Karimzadeh 2012</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Karimzadeh-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Karimzadeh 2012</LINK> was at a high risk of bias in most domains and <LINK REF="STD-Bonifati-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Bonifati 2000</LINK> was at unclear risk of selection bias and high risk of selective reporting. We downgraded evidence from these studies twice for serious limitations in trial design and implementation. <LINK REF="STD-Brooke-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Brooke 1996</LINK>, a large four-arm study (n = 196) comparing two doses of deflazacort, prednisone and placebo, also represented a risk of publication bias, being available only as an abstract, providing little useful data.</P>

<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2016-04-29 17:24:34 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="KLJ ">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2016-04-29 17:24:34 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="KLJ ">
<P>Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) provide moderate quality evidence that treatment with corticosteroids in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) compared with placebo improves muscle strength and function, including respiratory muscle strength and function, for six months. There is evidence of continuing benefit on muscle strength and function at one year. On the basis of the evidence available, our confidence in the effect estimate for the efficacy of a 0.75 mg/kg/day dose of prednisolone or above is fairly secure. Little RCT evidence is available on longer-term effects of corticosteroids versus placebo; one small longer-term RCT found an improvement in muscle strength at two years with deflazacort, with imprecise results on function at two years. Not enough data were available to adequately compare the efficacy of prednisone and deflazacort, although there is very low quality data favouring deflazacort for less weight gain. In the short term (12 months), a weekend-only prednisolone regimen is as effective as daily prednisolone according to low to moderate quality evidence from a single trial. Low quality evidence did not show a difference between the regimens on change in body mass index (BMI). A greater increase in linear height occurred in the weekend-only regimen, but no appreciable difference in other side effects. The long-term benefits and harms of daily corticosteroids or daily versus intermittent regimens are not clear. Non-randomised studies suggest that clinically significant prolongation of time to loss of ambulation is possible with daily corticosteroids, though potential harms, including weight gain, behavioural changes, vertebral fractures, and cataracts, are significant. Non-randomised studies also suggest there may be a divergence in efficacy between daily and intermittent prednisolone regimens beyond the age of seven years, with greater side effects from daily regimens in the longer term.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2016-04-25 16:28:21 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Ruth  Brassington">
<P>Many issues, including the ideal age or functional stage for initiation of treatment, the optimal corticosteroid type, regimen and dose, strategies for prevention of osteoporosis, and the age for discontinuation of corticosteroid treatment still need to be clarified with RCTs. This will require national and international collaboration, standardised and comparable protocols of assessment, timely publication of studies and the facility of sharing anonymised individual patient data. While previous studies have focused mainly on muscle strength, walking, and motor aspects, studies are now beginning to address respiratory, cardiac, and quality of life issues; this review or separate Cochrane reviews will examine these outcomes in future. The Quality Standards Subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology and the Practice Committee of the Child Neurology Society emphasised the need for studies to be long term to evaluate the effect of corticosteroids on ambulation, respiratory function, cardiac function, and quality of life. There is a need to identify and evaluate strategies to prevent the predictable adverse effects of long-term corticosteroid treatment, particularly excessive weight gain, osteoporosis, and growth retardation. The incorporation of patient and caregiver evaluations of the beneficial and adverse effects of treatment, as additional outcome measures, should be considered. The impact of corticosteroid therapy on quality of life of the patient and the family, in relation both to benefits and adverse effects, should also be evaluated.</P>

<P>Results from a 2015 paper by Bello et al. are not included in this review. In this study, the authors report that in a large observational study of 340 boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) (CINRG Duchenne Natural History Study), participants treated &#8805; 1 year with glucocorticoids (GCs) while ambulatory (n = 252/340) showed a 3-year median delay in loss of ambulation (LoA) (p &lt; 0.001). Participants aged 2 to 28 years at baseline were recruited in 20 CINRG centers in the USA, Canada, Argentina, Sweden, Italy, Israel, India, and Australia. Average dose was lower for daily prednisone or prednisolone (0.56 mg/kg/day, 75% of recommended) than daily deflazacort (0.75 mg/kg/day, 83% of recommended, p&lt;0.001), and non-daily treatment was more common for prednisone or prednisolone (37%) than deflazacort (3%). In a Cox regression analysis adjusted for dose and regimen, deflazacort was associated with a lower yearly risk of LoA than prednisone or prednisolone (HR 0.294 ± 0.053 vs. 0.490 ± 0.08, p=0.003). In participants treated with a daily regimen, a later median LoA was observed with deflazacort compared to prednisone or prednisolone (13.9 years vs. 11.2 years). Deflazacort showed higher frequencies of reported growth delay (p&lt;0.001), Cushingoid appearance (p=0.002), and cataracts (p&lt;0.001), but not of weight gain. Although this was a non-randomized, observational study, at risk of bias from potential differences in standards of care because of geographical location and age, we feel that the important results described therein should have been included in this review, along with those of other large observational studies.</P>

Cochrane practice requires that searches for all relevant databases be run (or re-run) within 12 months before publication of the review or review update. The completion date of this review was very close to this timeframe (within one month). As such a late update search was performed, we included all new RCTs identified within the year that met the inclusion criteria. The observational study by Bello was noted and given its large size was of interest. However, as a non-randomized study it did not meet our inclusion criteria and the conclusions of the study mirrored those of earlier long-term observational studies that were already discussed. As the study provided supporting evidence to already presented data it was not included at such a late editorial stage. However, it is of interest to future updates and we have listed the study and another non-randomised study identified in the final search as &#8216;Studies awaiting classification&#8217; for consideration when the review is next updated.</P>
