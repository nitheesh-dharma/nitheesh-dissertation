<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2015-05-20 13:27:33 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Patients may control pain after surgery by self administration of analgesics (pain killers) using devices designed for this purpose (patient controlled analgesia or PCA). PCA involves self administration (by pushing a button) of small doses of opioids (such as morphine) intravenously by means of a programmable pump. Previous studies have shown that often patients prefer PCA to traditional methods of pain management, such as a nurse administering an analgesic upon a patient's request. This review demonstrated moderate to low quality evidence that PCA provided slightly better pain control and increased patient satisfaction when compared with non-patient controlled methods. Patients tended to use slightly higher doses of medication with PCA and suffered a higher occurrence of itching, but otherwise side effects were similar between groups.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2015-05-20 13:26:29 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This is an updated version of the original Cochrane review published in Issue 4, 2006. Patients may control postoperative pain by self administration of intravenous opioids using devices designed for this purpose (patient controlled analgesia or PCA). A 1992 meta-analysis by Ballantyne et al found a strong patient preference for PCA over non-patient controlled analgesia, but disclosed no differences in analgesic consumption or length of postoperative hospital stay. Although Ballantyne's meta-analysis found that PCA did have a small but statistically significant benefit upon pain intensity, a 2001 review by Walder et al did not find statistically significant differences in pain intensity or pain relief between PCA and groups treated with non-patient controlled analgesia.</P>

<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2015-05-20 13:26:46 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>To evaluate the efficacy and safety of patient controlled intravenous opioid analgesia (termed PCA in this review) versus non-patient controlled opioid analgesia of as-needed opioid analgesia for postoperative pain relief.</P>

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2015-05-11 13:28:47 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We ran the search for the previous review in November 2004. For this update, we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2014, Issue 12), MEDLINE (1966 to 28 January 2015), and EMBASE (1980 to 28 January 2015) for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in any language, and reference lists of reviews and retrieved articles.</P>

<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2015-05-20 13:27:08 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We selected RCTs that assessed pain intensity as a primary or secondary outcome. These studies compared PCA without a continuous background infusion with non-patient controlled opioid analgesic regimens. We excluded studies that explicitly stated they involved patients with chronic pain.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2015-05-11 13:28:47 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two review authors independently extracted data, which included demographic variables, type of surgery, interventions, efficacy, and adverse events. We graded each included study for methodological quality by assessing risk of bias and employed the GRADE approach to assess the overall quality of the evidence. We performed meta-analysis of outcomes that included pain intensity assessed by a 0 to 100 visual analog scale (VAS), opioid consumption, patient satisfaction, length of stay, and adverse events.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-05-20 13:27:20 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Forty-nine studies with 1725 participants receiving PCA and 1687 participants assigned to a control group met the inclusion criteria. The original review included 55 studies with 2023 patients receiving PCA and 1838 patients assigned to a control group. There were fewer included studies in our updated review due to the revised exclusion criteria. For the primary outcome, participants receiving PCA had lower VAS pain intensity scores versus non-patient controlled analgesia over most time intervals, e.g., scores over 0 to 24 hours were nine points lower (95% confidence interval (CI) -13 to -5, moderate quality evidence) and over 0 to 48 hours were 10 points lower (95% CI -12 to -7, low quality evidence). Among the secondary outcomes, participants were more satisfied with PCA (81% versus 61%, P value = 0.002) and consumed higher amounts of opioids than controls (0 to 24 hours, 7 mg more of intravenous morphine equivalents, 95% CI 1 mg to 13 mg). Those receiving PCA had a higher incidence of pruritus (15% versus 8%, P value = 0.01) but had a similar incidence of other adverse events. There was no difference in the length of hospital stay.</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2015-05-20 13:27:24 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Since the last version of this review, we have found new studies providing additional information. We reanalyzed the data but the results did not substantially alter any of our previously published conclusions. This review provides moderate to low quality evidence that PCA is an efficacious alternative to non-patient controlled systemic analgesia for postoperative pain control.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2015-05-20 13:35:57 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review is an update of a previously published review in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (Issue 4, 2006) on 'Patient controlled opioid analgesia versus conventional opioid analgesia for controlling postoperative pain'. The title has been amended slightly for this update to reflect changes in terminology for 'conventional analgesia' to 'non-patient controlled analgesia'.</P>
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2014-10-15 18:06:24 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Pain after surgery is common. Many postoperative analgesic regimens rely upon a patient to self administer analgesics. For example, a patient may be given a prescription for tablets and instructed to take one every few hours as needed. The development in the late 1960s of devices (<LINK REF="REF-Evans-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Evans 1976</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Keeri_x002d_Szanto-1971" TYPE="REFERENCE">Keeri-Szanto 1971</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Harmer-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harmer 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schezer-1968" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schezer 1968</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schug-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schug 2000</LINK>) for the precise intravenous (or, on occasion, subcutaneous) delivery of bolus (single) doses of opioids upon the demand of the patient, with provision of regulation by their healthcare provider, led to coinage of the term 'patient controlled analgesia' (PCA).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2015-05-11 13:32:36 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>PCA is now routinely used in postoperative care throughout much of the developed world (<LINK REF="REF-Carr-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carr 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Warfield-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Warfield 1995</LINK>). PCA devices are programmable by the healthcare provider to deliver a specific amount of medication upon each request by the patient. A continuous 'background' infusion may be co-administered in addition to patient controlled bolus doses. Bolus doses are limited by a programmed 'lockout interval' within which subsequent requests are ignored or a cumulative limit to drug dose permitted in a fixed interval, such as one or more hours (<LINK REF="REF-Ferrante-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ferrante 1990</LINK>). PCA may be applied via intravenous, subcutaneous, transdermal, epidural or intrathecal routes (<LINK REF="REF-Crews-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Crews 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Viscusi-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Viscusi 2004</LINK>), and other routes (for example, pulmonary or nasal) have also been investigated (<LINK REF="REF-Christensen-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Christensen 2008</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2015-05-11 13:28:47 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Commonly, PCA devices are applied to deliver intravenous opioids after operations, although PCA has also been used following trauma or to treat cancer pain (<LINK REF="REF-Lehmann-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lehmann 1999</LINK>), and to deliver non-opioids such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (<LINK REF="REF-Cepeda-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cepeda 1995</LINK>) or local anesthetics (<LINK REF="REF-Cepeda-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cepeda 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-DeKock-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">DeKock 1994</LINK>). Opioids provide analgesia by binding to opioid receptors of the mu and kappa class, blocking the release of neurotransmitters such as substance P and enhancing descending inhibitory pain pathways. Opioid receptors are expressed both centrally and peripherally during the inflammatory response in injured tissue.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2015-05-20 13:35:57 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>PCA is a widely applied modality although its costs (particularly in comparison to those of non-patient controlled intramuscular analgesics) are not fully determined (<LINK REF="REF-Jacox-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jacox 1997</LINK>). A previous systematic review, <LINK REF="REF-Ballantyne-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ballantyne 1993</LINK>, found pain control during PCA to be superior to non-patient controlled postoperative analgesia. However, the magnitude of the difference (6 mm on a zero to 100 mm visual analog scale (VAS)) was small. A later systematic review, <LINK REF="REF-Walder-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walder 2001</LINK>, did not find differences in pain intensity or pain relief between PCA and non-patient controlled treatment, although patients expressed a preference for PCA. Those findings suggest that the patient preference for PCA over non-patient controlled analgesia described in both reviews reflects factors other than analgesia per se, such as increased autonomy (<LINK REF="REF-Ferrante-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ferrante 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kiecolt_x002d_Glaser-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kiecolt-Glaser 1998</LINK>). The present review examines randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of patient controlled intravenous analgesia versus non-patient controlled postoperative opioid analgesia to treat postoperative pain. The updated review was undertaken in order to re-examine the previous review by applying advances in Cochrane methodology and to incorporate evidence from newly published studies. The update was also prompted by evidence, published after our original review, raising safety concerns (particularly risk of respiratory depression) in patients using PCA (<LINK REF="REF-Overdyk-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Overdyk 2007</LINK>).</P>

<P>For the updated review we excluded studies with fewer than 10 participants per arm (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 1998</LINK>), and abstracts that were more than three years old.</P>
<P>We included RCTs in this review if they compared the efficacy of opioid PCA versus non-patient controlled (conventional) opioid regimens. We included studies with pain intensity as the primary or secondary outcome. We excluded non-randomized studies and case reports as well as retrieved trials that presented insufficient data to allow assessment of outcomes of interest or study quality.</P>
</CRIT_STUDIES>
<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS MODIFIED="2015-05-11 13:28:48 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>For the updated review, we performed sensitivity analysis with studies of pediatric participants removed.</P>
<P>We set no age limits (but see above) for patient inclusion except to require that the participant (and not a surrogate such as a parent or nurse) operated the PCA and reported pain intensity. Thus, participants in the enrolled studies had to have the cognitive ability to understand the concept of PCA and to report pain intensity on a standardized scale. We excluded trials in which participants received an initial period of analgesia other than PCA postoperatively (for example, those sedated and ventilated for one to two days after surgery). However, we included studies in which nurses administered analgesia immediately after surgery in order to stabilize the patient. We also excluded trials that explicitly stated they enrolled patients with chronic pain or who were receiving chronic opioid therapy, if data from such participants were not separable from those of participants without preoperative chronic pain or opioid therapy.</P>
</CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS MODIFIED="2015-05-20 13:38:05 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We compared intermittent doses of opioids self administered to participants via PCA pumps to non-patient controlled administration of opioids. For the updated review, because of the evolution of postoperative analgesic regimens since our original review, we have more clearly defined our interpretation of 'conventional' analgesia. We included studies where an opioid was administered as needed, but not if opioid administration was scheduled, i.e., around the clock. We considered regimens where an opioid was administered by any of the following routes to be conventional (non-patient controlled): intravenous (bolus or intermittent infusion), intramuscular, subcutaneous, oral, and rectal. We performed a sensitivity analysis where only parenteral routes were analyzed. As non-opioids, i.e., non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and acetaminophen, are now routinely a component of postoperative multimodal analgesic regimens, we revised our previous exclusion criteria for studies administering such drugs to exclude only those studies where an non-opioid was physically added to the PCA solution, where only one group received a non-opioid, or where both groups received non-opioids, but the specific non-opioid, dose or schedule differed between groups.</P>
<P>The opioids included in this review were limited to morphine and other full mu opioid agonists (a drug that binds to and activates an opioid receptor) such as hydromorphone, meperidine (synonymous with pethidine), codeine, fentanyl, piritramide, and ketobemidone. We excluded trials in which PCA was used to administer opioids whose actions are pharmacologically distinct from those of morphine or that display a plateau dose response (for example, partial mu opioid agonists such as buprenorphine, or mixed kappa opioid agonist and mu opioid antagonist compounds such as butorphanol). We excluded studies in which non-opioids were co-administered during opioid PCA (except as stated above) because the opioid-sparing effect of non-opioids might decrease the generalizability of study results by decreasing opioid requirements or pain intensity, or both, in participants in the trial (<LINK REF="REF-Souter-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Souter 1995</LINK>). We excluded studies in which continuous (background) intravenous opioid infusion was provided in the PCA group from this review. Trials frequently rely on nurses to administer non-patient controlled analgesics, but the lack of information on this aspect of a trial was not an exclusion criterion.</P>

<CRIT_OUTCOMES MODIFIED="2015-05-20 13:22:53 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>For the updated review, we added the following outcomes to reflect advances in Cochrane methodology: serious adverse events; withdrawals due to adverse events; and withdrawals due to lack of efficacy. We also added the safety outcome 'respiratory depression', as evidence published since our original review suggests that this may be more common and serious than previously thought (<LINK REF="REF-Overdyk-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Overdyk 2007</LINK>). The existing outcome, 'length of stay', we renamed 'length of stay: time to readiness for discharge' as time to actual discharge may be affected by non-clinical factors; however all included studies reported the former outcome only.</P>
<CRIT_OUTCOMES_PRIMARY MODIFIED="2015-05-11 13:28:48 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The primary outcome was pain intensity assessed via a visual analog scale (VAS). Pain intensity data assessed by means other than a zero to 100 VAS were normalized to such a scale. To do so, we either multiplied the original scale employed by an appropriate factor (for example, by 10 if the original scale ranged from zero to 10) or by assigning values on a zero to 100 scale that corresponded to choices on the original assessment scale. For example, if a participant was offered a five-point scale, selection of the second point was scored as 50 on a zero to 100 scale (0 = no pain, 1 = 25, 2 = 50, 3 = 75, 4 = 100).</P>

<P>In our original review, we graded included studies for methodological quality using the Oxford Quality Scale (<LINK REF="REF-Jadad-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jadad 1996</LINK>). In this updated review, we also used the 'Risk of bias' tool for both the original included studies and those included from the updated search. Two review authors independently assessed the risk of bias of all included studies. The review authors made critical assessments for each of the following domains: sequence generation (randomization), allocation concealment, blinding, incomplete outcome data, selective outcome reporting, and other risks of bias (e.g., small sample sizes). For sample size, we considered studies to be at low risk of bias if they had 200 participants or more, at unknown risk if they had 50 to 200 participants, and at high risk if they had fewer than 50 participants (<LINK REF="REF-Derry-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Derry 2013</LINK>). We entered the review author judgment for each domain into a 'Risk of bias' table, with answers 'low risk', 'high risk' or 'unclear risk' (indicating either lack of information or uncertainty over the potential for bias).</P>
<P>We employed the GRADE approach to assess the overall quality of evidence (<LINK REF="REF-GRADE-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">GRADE 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Langendam-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Langendam 2013</LINK>).

<P>We used discrete events, such as preference for PCA versus non-patient controlled analgesic regimens, or the number of participants with adverse events, to calculate the risk difference, risk ratio, or both (we calculated odds ratios in our original review, but these are more difficult to interpret (<LINK REF="REF-Sackett-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sackett 1996</LINK>)) using Review Manager 5.3 software.

<HETEROGENEITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2015-05-11 13:28:48 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We evaluated heterogeneity between and within trials using both the Chi test and the I statistic. The Chi test assesses whether observed differences in results are compatible with chance alone. A low P value (or a large Chi statistic relative to its degrees of freedom) provides evidence of heterogeneity of treatment effects (variation in effect estimates beyond chance). The Chi test has low power in estimating heterogeneity in the common situation where few trials are analyzed or where included trials have small sample sizes. Although a statistically significant result may indicate a problem with heterogeneity, a non-significant result is not necessarily evidence of lack of heterogeneity. Methods developed for quantifying inconsistency across studies that move the focus away from testing whether heterogeneity is present to assessing its impact on the meta-analysis include the I statistic. I = [(Q - df)/Q] x 100%, where Q is the Chi statistic and df is its degrees of freedom (<LINK REF="REF-Deeks-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deeks 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2003</LINK>). The I statistic describes the percentage of the variability in effect estimates that is due to heterogeneity rather than sampling error (chance). A value greater than 50% may be considered substantial heterogeneity (<LINK REF="REF-Deeks-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deeks 2011</LINK>).

These two papers were analyzed as comprising two different studies in each paper. Conversely, two papers reported different outcomes from the same study (<LINK REF="STD-Egbert-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Egbert 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Egbert-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Egbert 1993</LINK>). As a result, the 48 papers produced 49 studies eligible for analysis.</P>
<P>In the 49 included studies, 1725 patients were randomly allocated to PCA groups and 1687 patients to control groups. All analyzed studies were conducted in inpatient settings. In aggregate, the studies spanned all ages (children, adolescents, elderly) with the youngest participant being seven years old. One study, <LINK REF="STD-Berde-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Berde 1991</LINK>, exclusively evaluated children and adolescents aged seven to 19 years. For the updated review, we conducted a sensitivity analysis in which this study was excluded. Seven of the 49 studies enrolled more than 100 patients. The largest study involved 328 patients (PCA: n = 143; control: n = 185) (<LINK REF="STD-Jackson-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Jackson 1989</LINK>). Twenty-four studies included fewer than 50 patients. The smallest study consisted of 20 patients, i.e., the minimum number for inclusion in our review (<LINK REF="STD-Bhise-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Bhise 1997</LINK>). Nine studies did not present data describing the numbers of males and females. Of the remaining studies, 24 studies enrolled males and females, one study only included males, and 15 studies included only females. In the studies that reported outcomes in both sexes, females outnumbered males, mostly because of the large number of studies evaluating lower abdominal gynecologic procedures (15 studies). Patients underwent various operations; the most common surgeries were abdominal procedures (29 studies) followed by cardiothoracic surgeries (nine studies).</P>
<P>In the control groups, analgesia was administered intramuscularly (34 studies), subcutaneously (three studies), as intravenous boluses (six studies), as intravenous infusions with and without intravenous boluses (four studies), as combined intravenous and intramuscular injections (one trial), and with combined oral and intramuscular administration (one trial). We performed a sensitivity analysis for the one trial that evaluated a non-parenteral route of administration (<LINK REF="STD-Precious-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Precious 1997</LINK>). While not all papers described who administered opioid in the control groups, in those that did, a nurse was responsible for its delivery. Forty studies compared the same analgesic in both groups: morphine (29), meperidine (five), fentanyl (two), hydromorphone (one), piritramide (one), ketobemidone (one), and papaveretum (one). Nine studies compared two different opioids: meperidine PCA versus morphine control (two studies); morphine PCA versus codeine (two); morphine or meperidine PCA versus meperidine (two); morphine PCA versus morphine or codeine (one); morphine PCA versus meperidine (one); and meperidine or morphine PCA versus morphine (one).</P>
<P>The most frequently used opioid in the PCA arms was morphine (33 studies). In these 33 studies the most commonly administered dose of morphine was 1 mg (16 studies) (range: 0.5 mg to 2.5 mg). The most frequent lockout intervals were 10 minutes (11 studies) and five to six minutes (18 studies) (range: 5 minutes to 20 minutes). In the majority of studies there was no reported dose limit (33 studies).</P>
<P>We were not able to include data from every study in all of our meta-analyses. Some studies did not assess or report all outcomes of interest (for example, <A HREF="http://archie.cochrane.org/sections/documents/view?document=620600110615401864&amp;format=REVMAN#STD-Bedder-1991">Bedder 1991</A> assessed morphine consumption, VAS, and some adverse effects but did not examine patient satisfaction and length of stay). In some of the papers the data were incomplete (for example, missing standard deviations (SD)) and so could not be used for statistical analysis. Other data could not be used because they were not clearly defined or were presented in an idiosyncratic manner (for example, in <A HREF="http://archie.cochrane.org/sections/documents/view?document=620600110615401864&amp;format=REVMAN#STD-Harrison-1988">Harrison 1988</A> analgesia was assessed according to the percentages of patients reporting mild, moderate, or severe pain).</P>

<P>Our original review used the Oxford Quality Scale to assess the quality of each included study. Each report was scored independently for quality by two of the review authors using a three-item scale (<A HREF="http://archie.cochrane.org/sections/documents/view?document=620600110615401864&amp;format=REVMAN#REF-Jadad-1996">Jadad 1996</A>). The review authors then met to agree a 'consensus' score for each report. The quality scores for individual studies are reported in the notes section of the <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK> table. These scores were not used to weight the results in any way. The maximum possible score on the Oxford scale (indicating a trial of high methodological quality) is five. None of the studies comparing PCA with non-patient controlled analgesia was double-blinded, therefore we could not assign any points based upon blinding. Therefore, the highest possible score for included studies was three. The median quality score of the included studies was two.</P>

Adequate description of randomization included details in relation to use of computer-generated randomization, use of a random numbers table, shuffled sealed envelopes, or coin toss.

For this reason, moderate quality evidence is the highest level presented in the 'Summary of findings' tables. Low quality evidence was established as meeting two criteria for low quality, including lack of blinding and one of the following: unexplained heterogeneity, total population size below 400, and if the 95% confidence interval (CI) included no effect.

<P>See <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>: VAS pain scores (0 to 100): patient controlled analgesia (PCA) versus control for postoperative pain.</P>
<P>Quality of analgesia was assessed by asking participants to report their pain intensity using a VAS. Different investigators recorded this outcome on different scales and at different intervals. We normalized all VAS to a zero to 100 range. The majority of authors reported average results over the following intervals: zero to 24 hours, 25 to 48 hours, 49 to 72 hours, and zero to 48 hours. One trial, <A HREF="http://archie.cochrane.org/sections/documents/view?document=620600110615401864&amp;format=REVMAN#STD-Bedder-1991">Bedder 1991</A>, reported the average VAS over 36 hours and we included it in the zero to 48 hours analysis. Data were generally reported as the average pain intensity of multiple observations over any given time period; however, in studies in which the only data available were single measurements at the end of a time period (for example, 24 hours) we used this measurement.</P>
<P>Pain intensity over the first 24 hours was reported in 23 studies, which involved 1516 participants with 780 in the PCA group and 736 in the control group (moderate quality of evidence according to the GRADE criteria). Participants in the PCA group reported a mean difference (MD) in pain intensity nine points lower than in the control group (95% CI -13 to -5) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>, <LINK REF="FIG-04" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 4</LINK>). Average pain intensity in the postoperative 25 to 48 hours was described in 13 studies (609 participants, 321 with PCA and 288 controls; low quality of evidence according to the GRADE criteria). Meta-analysis favored the PCA group: participants in the PCA group had lower pain scores than their counterparts (MD -9, 95% CI -14 to -3) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>). Three studies (231 participants, 117 participants with PCA and 114 controls) analyzed pain intensity in the interval from 49 to 72 hours (very low quality of evidence according to the GRADE criteria). Our analysis again favored the PCA group, although the results were not statistically significant (P value = 0.09, <LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>). Seven studies examined pain scores over the zero to 48 hours interval (372 participants, 206 with PCA and 166 controls; low quality of evidence according to the GRADE criteria). Participants in the PCA group rated their pain 10 points less than those given conventional therapy (95% CI -12 to -7) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.4</LINK>). Only one study including 83 participants, <LINK REF="STD-Egbert-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Egbert 1990</LINK>, reported results of pain intensity in the zero to 72-hour interval and demonstrated an eight-point difference between PCA and control (95% CI -15 to -1, <LINK REF="CMP-001.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.5</LINK>).</P>
<P>We subanalyzed pain intensity according to the type of surgery. We were able to create five subgroups for analysis of the zero to 24-hour postoperative interval: lower abdominal surgery (seven studies), upper abdominal (six studies), cardiothoracic (four studies), neurosurgery (three studies), and mixed/other (three studies). Results of pain intensity statistically favored PCA over controls for lower abdominal and neurosurgery, but were not statistically significant for upper abdominal, cardiothoracic, and mixed/other surgery types (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>; <LINK REF="FIG-04" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 4</LINK>). There was evidence of substantial heterogeneity within many of the subanalyses, based on inspection of forest plots and I<SUP>2</SUP> values greater than 50%.</P>
<P>For the 25 to 48-hour postoperative interval, we evaluated five subgroups according to type of surgery: lower abdominal (three studies), upper abdominal (four studies), cardiothoracic (three studies), neurosurgery (one trial), and mixed/other (two studies). In the subcategories of lower and upper abdominal surgery and neurosurgery there were no statistical differences between groups. In the subcategories of cardiothoracic and mixed/other surgeries, meta-analysis statistically favored PCA (MD -19, 95% CI &#8211;26 to &#8211;13; and MD -12, 95% CI &#8211;18 to &#8211;6, respectively).</P>
<P>We performed no subanalyses for the postoperative intervals 49 to 72 hours, zero to 48 hours or zero to 72 hours due to the small number of studies according to each type of surgery. Similarly, there were not enough studies to generate a meaningful subanalysis according to orthopedic surgery for any postoperative interval.</P>
<P>We performed sensitivity analysis based on removing studies that we considered to be inadequately randomized (see 'Risk of bias' tables located with the <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>). For this reason, we removed four studies from any meta-analysis of pain intensity in which they had been included (<LINK REF="STD-Bollish-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Bollish 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ellis-1982-_x0028_hysterectomy_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Ellis 1982 (hysterectomy)</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Perez_x002d_Woods-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Perez-Woods 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Thomas-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Thomas 1995</LINK>.

In all of these analyses, best point estimates were similar and statistical significance was unchanged when compared to our original analyses.</P>
<P>One of the studies included in the analyses employed a cross-over design (<LINK REF="STD-Bollish-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Bollish 1985</LINK>). The<I> Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> suggests three approaches towards incorporating cross-over studies into a meta-analysis (<LINK REF="REF-Deeks-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deeks 2011</LINK>). One approach involves calculating a correlation coefficient to describe how similar the measurements on interventions A and B were within a participant. The study by Bollish did not provide sufficient information to calculate this coefficient. A second approach involves including data from only the first period; however, these data were not reported separately. A third approach is to simply treat results as if they were from a parallel trial. We used this approach for calculating differences between the two groups in pain scores at zero to 48 hours and opioid consumption at zero to 24 hours. All three approaches carry the potential for bias. For this reason, and again as suggested by the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I>, we performed a sensitivity analysis with this study removed from relevant comparisons, but given the low sample size of the study, it had no effect on the overall best point estimate or statistical significance of the differences found.</P>
<P>Lastly, a sensitivity analysis with removal of the one study which utilized a non-parenteral conventional regimen, <LINK REF="STD-Precious-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Precious 1997</LINK>, resulted in no difference in effect size or statistical significance of the quality of analgesia.</P>

<P>See <LINK REF="SOF-02" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 2</LINK>: Consumption of intravenous morphine equivalents: PCA versus control for postoperative pain.</P>
<P>Opioid consumption was analyzed in 33 studies. The total number of participants in those studies was 1586, with 803 participants in a PCA group and 783 participants in a control group (low quality of evidence according to the GRADE criteria). Different authors reported opioid consumption across different intervals. The most frequently reported results were over the first 24 hours (25 studies); nine studies continued to report results over the next 24 hours (25 to 48 hours post-operation); and eight studies reported opioid consumption from zero to 48 hours. Four studies described opioid consumption over the first 72 hours. Some investigators reported opioid consumption during more than one interval.</P>
<P>The first analysis, for opioid consumption in the zero to 24-hour postoperative interval, showed a statistically significantly higher consumption of morphine equivalents in the PCA group (MD 7 mg, 95% CI 1 to 13) (<LINK REF="CMP-002.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.1</LINK>; <LINK REF="FIG-05" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 5</LINK>). In the interval from 25 to 48 hours, opioid consumption was also statistically higher with PCA (MD 5 mg, 95% CI 3 to 8); moderate quality of evidence according to the GRADE criteria (<LINK REF="CMP-002.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.2</LINK>).</P>
<P>At the time interval zero to 48 hours there were no statistically significant differences and there was wide variation in cumulative opioid consumption between the PCA and control groups (MD 18 mg, 95% CI - 5 to 40) (<LINK REF="CMP-002.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.3</LINK>). Evaluation of cumulative opioid consumption over 72 hours (zero to 72 hours) showed a statistically significant difference in consumption of opioids between groups (MD 21 mg, 95% CI 5 to 37; very low quality of evidence according to the GRADE criteria (<LINK REF="CMP-002.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.4</LINK>)).</P>
<P>In a similar manner to our analysis of the quality of analgesia results, we explored subcategories based on type of surgery and performed a sensitivity analysis based upon eliminating inadequately randomized studies.</P>
<P>We performed subgroup meta-analysis for the following types of surgery to analyse opioid consumption over the first 24 hours: lower abdominal (504 participants, 259 with PCA and 245 controls), upper abdominal (252 participants, 125 with PCA and 127 controls), cardiothoracic (334, 171 with PCA and 163 controls), neurosurgery (213 participants, 105 with PCA and 108 controls), and mixed/other surgery types (283 participants, 143 with PCA and 140 controls). In all subcategories except neurosurgery, opioid consumption was not statistically different between the PCA and the control group. In the neurosurgery analysis, opioid consumption was statistically significantly higher with PCA versus control (MD 20 mg, 95% CI 4 to 35) (<LINK REF="CMP-002.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.1</LINK>; <LINK REF="FIG-05" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 5</LINK>).

<P>See <LINK REF="SOF-03" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 3</LINK>: Patient satisfaction: PCA versus control for postoperative pain.</P>
<P>Patient satisfaction results were presented as either continuous or dichotomous data, i.e., on a scale (usually zero to 10, where 10 is the most satisfied) or as the number of participants in a study arm satisfied with therapy.</P>
<P>Seven studies were available for analysis of satisfaction on a scale (427 participants, 233 with PCA and 194 controls; low quality of evidence according to the GRADE criteria). We reported standardized mean difference as we were unable to normalize the data to a 0 to 100 range. The mean satisfaction in the PCA groups was 0.55 standard deviations higher versus control (95% CI 0.13 to 0.97) (<LINK REF="CMP-003.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.1</LINK>).</P>
<P>The incidence of patient satisfaction was determined in 11 studies with a total of 547 participants (272 with PCA and 275 in control groups; low quality of evidence according to the GRADE criteria). More participants in the PCA groups were satisfied with their mode of analgesia (81% versus 61%; risk difference (RD) 0.20, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.32) (<LINK REF="CMP-003.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.2</LINK>; <LINK REF="FIG-06" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 6</LINK>). We calculated the corresponding number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) as 5 (95% CI 4 to 15).</P>
<P>We were not able to perform subanalyses according to type of surgery or sensitivity analyses by removal of inadequately randomized studies, due to an insufficient number of studies reporting data. A sensitivity analysis with removal of the one study which utilized a non-parenteral conventional regimen, <LINK REF="STD-Precious-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Precious 1997</LINK>, resulted in no difference in effect size or statistical significance related to patient satisfaction.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Length of hospital stay: time to readiness for discharge</HEADING>
<P>In the updated review, we amended this outcome to 'readiness for discharge' but since no studies reported results in this manner, we simply analyzed length of stay, as with the original review.</P>
<P>In the updated analysis, 14 studies reported differences in length of stay between participants using PCA and those in the control groups; however, not all reported data in a manner compatible with meta-analyses (e.g., stating that length of stay was similar between groups without reporting actual data). The 10 remaining studies that were suitable for meta-analysis (550 participants, 302 with PCA and 248 controls) demonstrated a slight but non-statistically significant reduction in length of stay in those participants using PCA (MD -0.18, 95% CI -0.63 to 0.26) (<LINK REF="CMP-004.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.1</LINK>). Again, there were an insufficient number of studies to perform subanalyses based on type of surgery.</P>
<P>We performed sensitivity analysis with removal of inadequately randomized studies (<A HREF="http://archie.cochrane.org/sections/documents/view?document=620600110615401864&amp;format=REVMAN#STD-Thomas-1995">Thomas 1995</A>), which changed neither the direction of effect estimate nor the statistical significance of the original analysis (<LINK REF="CMP-004.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.2</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Adverse events</HEADING>
<P>For the purposes of the updated analysis, an adverse event was defined as any undesirable experience associated with the use of a medical product in a patient. The most frequently reported adverse events were sedation, nausea and vomiting, pruritus, and urinary retention. Most studies did not specify the timing of adverse events. In the updated review, we added serious adverse events, withdrawals (due to lack of efficacy or adverse events), and respiratory depression to the safety analyses. For respiratory depression, we also performed subanalyses based on type of surgery.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Serious adverse events</HEADING>
<P>Nineteen studies reported data related to serious adverse events (1284 participants, 632 with PCA and 652 controls). No statistically significant difference was noted in serious adverse events between PCA and control groups. A total of 10 (1.6%) serious adverse events were reported in the PCA group from four studies (one death from <LINK REF="STD-Boulanger-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Boulanger 2002</LINK>; four wound infections from <LINK REF="STD-Kyzer-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Kyzer 1995</LINK>; one report of atelectasis from <LINK REF="STD-Rogers-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Rogers 1990</LINK>; four severe adhesions from <LINK REF="STD-Rosen-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Rosen 1998</LINK>). Seven (1.1%) serious adverse events were reported in the control group from three studies (one wound infection from <LINK REF="STD-Kyzer-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Kyzer 1995</LINK>; three from <LINK REF="STD-Myles-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Myles 1994</LINK> (two deaths and one cerebrovascular event); and three severe adhesions from <LINK REF="STD-Rosen-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Rosen 1998</LINK>) (<LINK REF="CMP-005.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 5.1</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Incidence and severity of individual adverse events</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Sedation</HEADING>
<P>Twenty-seven studies evaluated sedation, but not all studies provided data suitable for meta-analysis. Results were presented either on a continuous scale (usually zero to 10, where 10 is the most sedated) or as the number of participants in a study arm that experienced sedation.</P>
<P>Data suitable for analysis were reported in 20 studies (1323 participants). Ten studies (514 participants, 270 with PCA and 244 in controls) evaluated sedation by means of a scale. Where described, severity was predominately nurse evaluated. In one study, <LINK REF="STD-Berde-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Berde 1991</LINK>, severity was reported by both the participant and a nurse. Different scales were used (zero to 100, zero to 10, one to five, and a four-point scale). We reported standardized mean difference (SMD) as we were unable to normalize the data to a 0 to 100 range. Meta-analysis demonstrated that participants in the PCA group reported a non-statistically significant reduction in the degree of sedation (SMD -0.4, 95% CI -1.1 to 0.2) (<LINK REF="CMP-008.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 8.1</LINK>).</P>
<P>Ten studies (809 participants, 403 with PCA and 406 in control groups) expressed sedation as the number of participants reporting sedation. Incidence was similar between groups, with 15% of participants in the PCA group versus 16% of those in the control group reporting sedation (RD -0.01, 95% CI -0.03 to 0.02) (<LINK REF="CMP-008.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 8.2</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Nausea or vomiting, or both</HEADING>
<P>Nausea and vomiting were evaluated in 25 studies (1652 participants).</P>
<P>Three studies (127 participants, 67 with PCA and 60 in control groups) assessed severity of nausea and vomiting using a scale (all utilized a zero to 10-point scale). Meta-analysis yielded no clinical or statistical evidence of a difference in severity of nausea between PCA and control groups (<LINK REF="CMP-009.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 9.1</LINK>). As noted above, because of the inclusion of pediatric participants in one study (<LINK REF="STD-Berde-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Berde 1991</LINK>), we performed sensitivity analysis where the study was removed from analysis. Exclusion of this study resulted in a statistically significant reduction in severity of nausea and vomiting in the PCA group (RD -1.3, 95% CI -2.3 to -0.3), but this was based on only two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Ellis-1982-_x0028_chole_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Ellis 1982 (chole)</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ellis-1982-_x0028_hysterectomy_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Ellis 1982 (hysterectomy)</LINK>).</P>
<P>Twenty-two studies (1525 participants, 766 with PCA and 759 in control groups) expressed numbers of participants in each group reporting nausea or vomiting, or both. Dichotomous data again demonstrated no statistically significant difference between groups (30% versus 32%; RD 0, 95% CI -0.06 to 0.06) (<LINK REF="CMP-009.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 9.2</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Pruritus</HEADING>
<P>The incidence of pruritus was evaluated in 10 studies (544 participants, 272 with PCA and 272 in control groups). All studies used the same opioid in each arm. Meta-analysis yielded a non-statistically significant RD of 0.05 (95% CI -0.02 to 0.12), but a statistically significant risk ratio (RR) of 1.8 (95% CI 1.1 to 2.8), where more participants complained of pruritus in the PCA groups (15%) than in the control groups (8%) (<LINK REF="CMP-010.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 10.1</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Respiratory depression</HEADING>
<P>Respiratory depression was a safety outcome added to the updated analysis. In studies that did not specifically define respiratory depression we evaluated the outcome as oxygen desaturations to 90% and below, respiratory rate less than 10/min, and/or if naloxone was required.</P>
<P>Twenty-nine studies reported data for respiratory depression (1914 participants, 947 with PCA and 967 in control groups). Meta-analysis noted no meaningful evidence of an effect between PCA and controls in regards to occurrence of respiratory depression. In the PCA group, 22 participants (2.3%) experienced respiratory depression versus 19 in the control groups (2%) (RD 0, 95% CI -0.01 to 0.01). Almost half of all reports of respiratory depression were reported from cardiothoracic surgeries (12 events with PCA versus eight events in control groups) (<LINK REF="CMP-011.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 11.1</LINK>).</P>
<P>Meta-analyses revealed no statistically significant evidence of an effect in respiratory depression in any subgroup by type of surgery (<LINK REF="CMP-011.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 11.1</LINK>). Orthopedic surgeries reported no events of respiratory depression in either the PCA or control groups.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Urinary retention</HEADING>
<P>The incidence of urinary retention was reported in six studies (467 participants, 239 with PCA and 228 in control groups). There was no clinical or statistical difference in the incidence of urinary retention between groups (23% versus 25%; RD -0.04, 95% CI -0.11 to 0.03) (<LINK REF="CMP-012.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 12.1</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Withdrawals due to adverse events or lack of efficacy</HEADING>
<P>Eighteen studies reported on withdrawals due to adverse events (1281 participants, 650 with PCA and 631 controls). No statistically significant difference was noted in withdrawals due to adverse events between PCA and control groups. A total of 16 withdrawals (2.5%) due to adverse events were reported from seven studies in the PCA group (<LINK REF="STD-Boulanger-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Boulanger 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Brewington-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Brewington 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gillman-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Gillman 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Morad-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Morad 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Morad-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Morad 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Paoletti-1993-_x0028_gyn_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Paoletti 1993 (gyn)</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Smythe-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Smythe 1994</LINK>). Twelve withdrawals (1.9%) due to adverse events were reported in the control group from three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Boulanger-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Boulanger 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Brewington-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Brewington 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Smythe-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Smythe 1994</LINK>) (<LINK REF="CMP-006.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 6.1</LINK>).</P>
<P>Withdrawals due to lack of efficacy were reported for 18 studies (1347 participants, 681 with PCA and 666 controls). No statistically significant difference was noted in withdrawals due to lack of efficacy between PCA and control groups. Four participants receiving PCA withdrew (0.6%) from two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Brewington-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Brewington 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Morad-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Morad 2012</LINK>) versus seven participants (1%) in the control groups from three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Morad-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Morad 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Morad-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Morad 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sudheer-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Sudheer 2007</LINK>) (<LINK REF="CMP-007.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 7.1</LINK>).</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-05-20 13:40:56 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Data from six additional studies were available for this updated review, four of which contributed data to the primary outcome. Conversely, 13 studies that met the inclusion criteria in our original review were excluded from our updated review, eight of which had contributed data to our primary outcome.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Primary outcome: pain intensity scores</HEADING>
<P>The results of our meta-analyses demonstrate that patient controlled analgesia (PCA) provided better pain control than non-patient controlled analgesia. Pain intensity on a visual analog scale (VAS) was statistically significantly lower in participants using PCA versus those receiving non-patient controlled analgesia at all time intervals, with the exception of the small meta-analysis of results reported over 49 to 72 hours, which showed a trend towards lower scores. Addition of data from the updated search and elimination of data from previously included studies (due to the updated exclusion criteria) had little effect on results at any time point. For example, for the 0 to 24-hour time period, 23 studies contributed data to the updated review and demonstrated an approximately nine-point reduction in pain on a 0 to 100 scale, whereas our original review demonstrated an approximately eight-point overall reduction from 27 studies.</P>
<P>PCA may have varying effectiveness depending on the extent of invasiveness of the surgery after which it is administered. For the updated review we created six subgroups according to type of surgery (versus only two in our original review). There were sufficient data for subgroup analysis by type of surgery for the time periods 0 to 24 hours and 25 to 48 hours. Reductions in pain differed by surgery type, but were also inconsistent across time periods, making conclusions about variations in effectiveness challenging.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Secondary outcomes</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Opioid consumption</HEADING>
<P>Opioid consumption was higher in participants using PCA than those administered non-patient controlled analgesia, although results between studies displayed substantial heterogeneity over the intervals 0 to 24 hours and 0 to 48 hours. This difference was statistically significant over the postoperative intervals of 0 to 24 hours, 25 to 48 hours, and 0 to 72 hours: 7 mg, 5 mg and 21 mg of morphine equivalents, respectively. Again, the updated meta-analyses demonstrated similar results to those in our original review. The clinical significance of this small difference is questionable. A single intravenous or intramuscular dose of morphine for moderate-to-severe pain in a healthy adult may be 5 mg to 10 mg (often given incrementally). Taking into consideration its elimination half-life (1.7 hours to 3.3 hours (<LINK REF="REF-Stoelting-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stoelting 1999</LINK>)) and duration of effect (three to four hours after either intravenous or intramuscular dosing (<LINK REF="REF-Fee-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fee 1996</LINK>)), the daily dose could conceivably reach 80 mg to 120 mg. Thus, an increased consumption of morphine by less than 8 mg/24 hours does not seem important clinically. On the other hand, in the included PCA trials the average morphine equivalent consumption during the first 24 hours was about 45 mg in the PCA group, so 8 mg/24 hours would represent about 20% of this dose.</P>
<P>The conversion of doses of opioids other than morphine to morphine equivalents may have affected our results, especially where different opioids were used in comparator arms within a study (<LINK REF="STD-Ellis-1982-_x0028_chole_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Ellis 1982 (chole)</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ellis-1982-_x0028_hysterectomy_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Ellis 1982 (hysterectomy)</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kyzer-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Kyzer 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Precious-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Precious 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stoneham-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Stoneham 1996</LINK>). Some studies reported amounts of both the particular opioid used and the conversion to morphine equivalents. Most stated the conversion factor used (<LINK REF="STD-Eisenach-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Eisenach 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kyzer-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Kyzer 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Precious-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Precious 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stoneham-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Stoneham 1996</LINK>). In those trials that did not convert to morphine equivalents (<LINK REF="STD-Boldt-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Boldt 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Crisp-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Crisp 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ellis-1982-_x0028_chole_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Ellis 1982 (chole)</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ellis-1982-_x0028_hysterectomy_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Ellis 1982 (hysterectomy)</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Morad-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Morad 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Murphy-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Murphy 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pettersson-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Pettersson 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rayburn-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Rayburn 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Thomas-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Thomas 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wang-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 1991</LINK>), we used standard conversion factors (<LINK REF="REF-APS-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">APS 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Micromedex-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Micromedex 2014</LINK>).</P>
<P>There were sufficient data for subanalysis by type of surgery for only the 0 to 24-hour interval. Only analysis of participants undergoing neurosurgery demonstrated a statistically significant increase in opioid consumption, perhaps as a reflection of the unusually high doses consumed in both groups. Conventionally, low doses of opioids are employed in many neurosurgeries because of beliefs that requirements are low and concerns over clouding diagnosis or worsening the patient's condition (<LINK REF="REF-Stoneham-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stoneham 1995</LINK>). Abdominal (upper and lower) and cardiothoracic surgeries showed a non-statistically significant trend towards higher opioid consumption in the PCA groups, but the magnitude of this difference was small, ranging from 4 mg to 10 mg of morphine equivalents. In cardiothoracic surgical patients this negative finding might be explained by the residual effect of large intraoperative opioid doses into the postoperative period.</P>
<P>Our results could also have been affected by the fact that the opioid administration regimens in the respective arms varied considerably between studies. However, in studies in which flexibility in dosing regimens was permitted, this was generally equally distributed among groups and we do not think that it contributed to bias in our results. Lastly, the observed disparity in opioid consumption may be related to factors like nurse availability or nurse assessment of the need for pain medication rather than true difference in analgesic requirements.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Patient satisfaction</HEADING>
<P>Although many studies investigated patient satisfaction, several did not supply extractable data. We analyzed 17 trials (939 participants). In common with our original review, none of the studies in our updated review demonstrated that participants were more satisfied with conventional treatment. Meta-analysis of both the degree of satisfaction and the number of participants satisfied with therapy statistically significantly favored participants in the PCA group, again in agreement with our 2006 analysis. Most of the studies did not indicate why participants reported satisfaction with a given therapy. It is not surprising to find greater satisfaction with PCA. Patients are given a greater degree of autonomy which, in turn, may reduce fears of insufficient analgesia. Instant availability of the medication may also contribute to greater satisfaction with the mode of treatment. We had insufficient data to perform subanalyses based upon type of surgery. It would be interesting to investigate whether patients undergoing more invasive surgeries would be less inclined to be in charge of their own pain management.</P>
<P>The measurement of satisfaction in trials where participants are not blinded to study arm assignment creates a potential for bias. All studies in our analysis were unblinded. In the older studies, participants who received a 'new breakthrough' treatment may have expressed a preference compared to those who 'missed out'. Alternatively, elderly and/or patients with higher acuity conditions may prefer conservative and established treatments or may not wish to be responsible for their analgesic regimen. However, advanced age does not appear to be the explanation in our meta-analysis, since the mean age of participants was only around 50 years after excluding pediatric participants and women who underwent cesarean section. Additionally, <LINK REF="STD-Egbert-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Egbert 1990</LINK>, which enrolled frail elderly men, demonstrated a statistically significant preference for PCA.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Length of stay</HEADING>
<P>Two additional studies from our updated search contributed data for analysis of length of stay, which included a total of 10 studies. Two trials reported that length of stay was statistically significantly shorter in the PCA group, one trial favored non-patient controlled analgesia, and seven did not find a statistically significant difference between groups. Similar to our original analysis, this updated meta-analysis showed that length of stay was 0.18 days shorter in the PCA group but, again, the difference was not statistically significant. The most appropriate approach would be to control for factors affecting the length of stay, such as comorbidities, or to assess readiness for discharge, rather than time to actual discharge. However, none of the included studies reported this outcome. These factors, in combination with the relatively small number of trials available for analysis, may contribute to absence of difference between the analyzed modes of analgesia.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Adverse events</HEADING>
<P>For our updated review we added the outcomes 'serious adverse events', 'withdrawals due to adverse events', 'withdrawals due to lack of efficacy', and 'respiratory depression', in addition to our original analyses of sedation, nausea and vomiting, pruritus, and urinary retention. We analyzed respiratory depression, potentially the most serious adverse event, separately since its inclusion in a larger analysis of adverse or serious adverse events may have caused obscuration of any difference between groups. We chose this approach in order to address recent evidence suggesting increased risk of respiratory depression in patients receiving PCA (<LINK REF="REF-Overdyk-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Overdyk 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>Our original analyses failed to show any differences, either clinical or statistical, for all but one of the most commonly reported adverse events - participants using PCA had a higher incidence of pruritus. The same was true for our updated review. In addition there were no statistically or clinically significant differences between groups for any of the new outcomes. While the possibility that there is, in fact, no difference in adverse event occurrence between interventions cannot be discounted, the lack of difference may be explained by the rarity with which many of the new adverse outcomes occur, the manner in which adverse event data are assessed in randomized controlled trials (RCTs), or both. Consistent and widely accepted definition of adverse events and prospective, scheduled timing of their collection facilitates accurate comparisons. Some of the adverse events, such as sedation, may be subjective unless strictly defined. Others are easier to quantify, however definitions differ across the studies. Respiratory depression, for example, was defined and assessed in numerous ways in the studies that reported it, including respiratory rates of less than 10 breaths per minute or oxygen saturation of less than 90%. It is acknowledged that reporting of adverse events in RCTs is often inadequate (<LINK REF="REF-Edwards-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Edwards 1999</LINK>), and that small studies are unable to detect differences in rare but serious adverse events (<LINK REF="REF-Liu-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liu 2007</LINK>). Only sedation, nausea and vomiting, pruritus, and urinary retention occurred in more than 10% of participants. Our meta-analysis demonstrated that only 22 of 947, or 2.3% of participants receiving PCA, were assessed as suffering from respiratory depression versus 19 of 967 participants (2.0%) in the conventional groups. Conversely, an observational study of patients using PCA, where respiratory depression was the primary outcome, reports much higher occurrences, i.e., 12% and 41% for desaturation (less than 90%) and bradypnea (respiratory rate less than 10 for three minutes or more), respectively (<LINK REF="REF-Overdyk-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Overdyk 2007</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-Liu-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liu 2007</LINK> points out that rare incidences of morbidity and mortality in modern surgery require subject samples of 500 to 50,000 to detect 50% reductions in incidence. Given these numbers, it is not surprising that our analyses of adverse events did not show a difference between groups. Lastly, adverse events occurring due to device malfunction or programming errors must be considered, but there were very few reports of these in the included studies. United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) data have identified both as being major causes of adverse event reporting in hospitals using PCA (<LINK REF="REF-Hankin-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hankin 2007</LINK>).</P>

<P>The included studies reported relevant data for both the primary and secondary outcomes. For the primary outcome, VAS pain scores, for the interval 0 to 24 hours 1516 participants contributed data. The studies enrolled participants undergoing a wide variety of surgeries for which PCA is commonly employed, although almost one-third of these studies were in females undergoing gynecologic surgery. Participants ranged from children to elderly, although there were few participants at the extremes of this range. Pediatric or geriatric patients may be more susceptible to both the positive and adverse effects of opioids. As mentioned in <LINK TAG="CRIT_INTERVENTIONS" TYPE="SECTION">Types of interventions</LINK>, we restricted our definition of 'conventional analgesia' in this updated review. We therefore did not include studies where participants received scheduled opioid regimens as opposed to those on an 'as needed' basis.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2015-05-11 13:28:49 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We assessed all studies as having a high risk of performance bias in that none of them were blinded. While theoretically possible in studies of PCA, blinding of participants appears to be impractical. It has been suggested that trials of low methodological quality may overestimate differences between therapies (<LINK REF="REF-Moher-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 1998</LINK>). From the information provided in the included studies we were able to ascertain that five studies were inadequately randomized. Exclusion of these trials made little difference either statistically or clinically to any of our analyses. Lastly, we assessed only three studies, <LINK REF="STD-Brewington-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Brewington 1989</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Jackson-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Jackson 1989</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Murphy-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Murphy 1994</LINK>, as having low risk of bias due to adequate sample sizes (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>When assessing the quality of findings using GRADE, we ranked them from moderate to very low across the different efficacy outcomes, primarily due to risk of performance bias from lack of blinding. In some outcomes, unexplained heterogeneity, low overall population sizes, and imprecision of results also contributed to our downgrading of the evidence. We attempted to explain heterogeneity by performing subgroup and sensitivity analyses but, for the most part, heterogeneity remained. We can, therefore, only speculate as to possible sources. We noted above the potential for between-study variability in conventional groups. In participants assigned to PCA groups, evidence of substantial variability in opioid demands between individuals has been documented (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2011</LINK>).</P>

<P>We analyzed data from cross-over studies in the same manner as that from parallel studies. This approach may give rise to a unit of analysis error (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). However, only one study employed a cross-over method (<LINK REF="STD-Bollish-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Bollish 1985</LINK>), and removal of this study from each meta-analysis made negligible differences in estimates of effect for either efficacy or safety.</P>
<P>We excluded studies that explicitly mentioned that they enrolled participants with chronic pain. A potential weakness of our analysis is that, while not specified, some participants, particularly orthopedic patients, might have experienced some degree of chronic pain preoperatively.</P>
<P>Advances in postoperative pain management suggest that the groups in newer studies might receive analgesic regimens superior to those used in older studies. We attempted to mitigate this by excluding studies employing scheduled regimens in the control group and studies where non-opioid regimens differed between groups. Similarly, recent improvements in surgical technique, such as using minimally invasive methods, may reduce pain and other complications from surgery, potentially lessening the superiority of PCA (<LINK REF="REF-Liu-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liu 2007</LINK>). However, for our primary outcome, VAS pain scores, included studies from 2006 and later actually demonstrated greater mean improvements versus earlier studies during the 0 to 24-hour interval and values remained similar over all time periods for each meta-analysis.</P>

<P>Two previous reviews compared PCA with non-patient controlled analgesia (<LINK REF="REF-Ballantyne-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ballantyne 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Walder-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walder 2001</LINK>). Walder and colleagues' meta-analysis did not reach the same conclusions as ours for our primary outcome (<LINK REF="REF-Walder-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walder 2001</LINK>). In that analysis, neither continuous data of pain intensity nor dichotomous data of combined pain intensity and pain relief produced statistically significant differences. The different results between the present analysis and that of Walder's may result from the different inclusion criteria employed. Walder's meta-analysis included studies in which both partial mu agonists and background infusions were employed in the PCA groups. Alternatively, the discordance between the two reviews may simply be due to our having a greater number of studies available for analysis and, therefore, a greater possibility of achieving statistical significance. Conversely, findings for our primary outcome are consistent with Ballantyne and colleagues' 1993 meta-analysis (<LINK REF="REF-Ballantyne-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ballantyne 1993</LINK>). Ballantyne's review concluded that patients treated with PCA were more comfortable than patients given non-patient controlled analgesia, even though the authors questioned the clinical significance of these findings (six points lower pain score in PCA patients on a zero to 100 VAS). Although the difference is greater in the present review, it is still questionable whether a nine-point lowering of pain intensity is clinically significant.</P>
<P>In contrast to both earlier reviews, we found that opioid consumption was higher in participants using PCA than those administered conventional analgesia. Exclusion criteria employed in our meta-analysis may have played a role in the observed finding. Walder's review included studies in which participants using PCA also had 'background infusions' of opioids. The continuous infusion of opioid in these studies may have contributed to more constant plasma levels and decreased demand for bolus doses. However, the use of a background infusion is generally discouraged in opioid-naive patients (<LINK REF="REF-APS-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">APS 2008</LINK>), as it may lead to opioid overdosage.</P>
<P>Our analysis of patient satisfaction is consistent with the results of <LINK REF="REF-Ballantyne-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ballantyne 1993</LINK>, even though the meta-analysis involved only 160 participants in that review. Walder and colleagues' analysis did not find a difference in patient satisfaction between groups, although they did report that more participants expressed a preference for PCA over conventional therapy. Our analysis of length of stay is consistent with Ballantyne's and Walder's results. Lastly, with regards to adverse events, both previous meta-analyses were unable to find significant differences in the incidence or severity of adverse events between groups.</P>

<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2015-05-20 13:41:34 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2015-05-20 13:41:34 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>A limited amount of additional data were identified for this update, reinforcing the conclusions of our previous review. The fact that patient controlled analgesia (PCA) is now standard practice may account for the scarcity of new randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing its efficacy.</P>
<P>
<B>For people with postoperative pain</B>
</P>
<P>PCA has gained acceptance among patients despite the lack of evidence supporting clinical advantages from this review or previous reviews. Low quality evidence demonstrates that patients report greater satisfaction with, and in general prefer, PCA. While the reasons for this preference are unclear, they may be a function of increased patient autonomy and absence of delay in opioid administration. Patients should expect pain relief to be marginally superior to that achieved with nurse-administered analgesia and a similar degree of side effects.</P>
<P>
<B>For clinicians</B>
</P>
<P>Our meta-analysis provides moderate to very low quality evidence that PCA provides superior analgesia in comparison to non-patient controlled regimens. Length of stay was similar in both groups. Despite slightly higher opioid consumption in participants using PCA, we found no increase in the occurrence of opioid-induced adverse effects. Where available and appropriate, PCA should be offered to patients.</P>
<P>
<B>For policy makers</B>
</P>
<P>PCA for postoperative pain control continues to be commonly used in many hospitals in the western world, and in the absence of new evidence or advances in technology, is likely to remain so in the near future.</P>
<P>
<B>For funders</B>
</P>
<P>Very limited evidence suggests that PCA may be more costly than nurse-administered analgesia. Our review does not demonstrate the potential for savings through reduced time to discharge. However, given that hospital reimbursement is, in part, contingent on patient satisfaction data in countries such as the United States, increases in direct costs may be offset by such policies.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2015-05-11 13:28:49 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>
<B>General</B>
</P>
<P>While intravenous administration remains the most commonly used mode of PCA, several alternative modes have been applied in the clinical setting or in controlled clinical trials. Alternative routes of administration include oral, transdermal, inhaled, intranasal, and epidural, each with their own potential benefits and disadvantages. Oral, transdermal, inhaled, and intranasal administration modalities offer the potential advantage of reductions in cost, labor, and required expertise of staff, and increased patient mobility when compared to intravenous PCA. There are currently insufficient RCTs available to determine whether any of the above modes of PCA will prove more safe or effective than intravenous PCA.</P>
<P>
<B>Design</B>
</P>
<P>While further trials investigating different surgeries may be helpful, the number of trials currently available for assessing overall efficacy of intravenous PCA is already extensive. More studies enrolling geriatric or pediatric populations, and those patients with risk factors such as chronic pain and substance abuse disorders, should be conducted. If possible, the quality of the future trials could be improved by introducing double-blinding and by clearly defining criteria for inclusion.</P>
<P>The safety profile of PCA has not been fully established in this review. Further research from large epidemiological studies that include high-risk patients and that assess programming error and device malfunction data are needed to provide a more complete picture of the risks associated with PCA.</P>
<P>
<B>Measurement (endpoints)</B>
</P>
<P>Most studies used standard validated pain intensity scales and widely accepted opioid conversion values. However, mean differences in pain scores or opioid consumption may not accurately reflect differences between PCA and nurse-administered analgesia. The use of dichotomous outcomes, such as the number of participants administering less than a predetermined cumulative amount of opioid may have greater validity.</P>
<P>
<B>Comparison between active treatments</B>
</P>
<P>There is a lack of either indirect or head-to-head comparisons of different opioids administered via PCA. While head-to-head studies were not considered for this analysis, evidence supporting the superiority of one opioid versus others or, conversely, a class effect would be helpful.</P>

<P>For the 2015 update, we made several changes based on the evolution of Cochrane methodology and advances in postoperative pain management since our original review. For the former, we added searching for unpublished data, 'Risk of bias' assessments, GRADE assessments, 'Summary of findings' tables and analyses of additional adverse event outcomes, while we excluded studies with fewer than 10 participants in each arm and abstracts that were more than three years old. For the latter, we excluded studies with scheduled regimens in the non-patient controlled analgesia arm, but we included studies that also administered non-opioids as long as the non-opioid regimens were the same between arms. We amended the title from 'Patient controlled opioid analgesia versus conventional opioid analgesia for postoperative pain' to 'Patient controlled opioid analgesia versus non-patient controlled opioid analgesia for postoperative pain' to reflect changes in clinical practice and terminology, and to add clarity to the review.</P>

<P>We assessed the impact of the exclusion of one included study (<LINK REF="STD-Boldt-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Boldt 1998</LINK>) on 1 May 2012. In 2011, 89 published studies in each of which Dr. Boldt was an author were retracted due to lack of evidence that they had received approval from an institutional review board (<A HREF="http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/03/04/us-journals-retractions-idUSTRE7235J820110304">http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/03/04/us-journals-retractions-idUSTRE7235J820110304</A>). The study included in this review, <LINK REF="STD-Boldt-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Boldt 1998</LINK>, is not one of those retracted (<A HREF="http://www.aaeditor.org/EIC.Joint.Statement.on.Retractions.pdf">http://www.aaeditor.org/EIC.Joint.Statement.on.Retractions.pdf</A>). However, as a precautionary measure, we re-analyzed all meta-analyses that contained data from the study with the data excluded. In total, 13 meta-analyses contained data, including comparisons of pain scores, opioid consumption, patient satisfaction, and various adverse events. Exclusion of these data did not affect either the statistical or clinical significance of any of our findings.</P>
<P>At 2015, the authors and editors agreed to re-assess this review for updating in 2020, as it is unlikely that further research will change conclusions.</P>
