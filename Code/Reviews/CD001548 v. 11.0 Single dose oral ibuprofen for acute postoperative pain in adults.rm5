<P>Ibuprofen at 200 mg and 400 mg produces a high level of pain relief in about half of those with moderate or severe acute postoperative pain. This is a good result compared with most other analgesics tested in a very well researched model of pain used for demonstrating that drugs can actually produce pain relief. There were no more adverse events than with placebo.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2009-03-13 15:18:42 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jessica R Thomas">
<P>This review updates a 1999 Cochrane review showing that ibuprofen at various doses was effective in postoperative pain in single dose studies designed to demonstrate analgesic efficacy. New studies have since been published. Ibuprofen is one of the most widely used non-steroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAID) analgesics both by prescription and as an over-the-counter medicine. Ibuprofen is used for acute and chronic painful conditions.</P>

<P>Randomised, double blind, placebo-controlled trials of single dose orally administered ibuprofen (any formulation) in adults with moderate to severe acute postoperative pain.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2009-05-11 15:17:19 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jessica R Thomas">
<P>Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. Pain relief or pain intensity data were extracted and converted into the dichotomous outcome of number of participants with at least 50% pain relief over 4 to 6 hours, from which relative risk and number-needed-to-treat-to-benefit (NNT) were calculated. Numbers of participants using rescue medication over specified time periods, and time to use of rescue medication, were sought as additional measures of efficacy. Information on adverse events and withdrawals were collected.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2009-05-11 15:17:45 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jessica R Thomas">
<P>Seventy-two studies compared ibuprofen and placebo (9186 participants). Studies were predominantly of high reporting quality, and the bulk of the information concerned ibuprofen 200 mg and 400 mg. For at least 50% pain relief compared with placebo the NNT for ibuprofen 200 mg (2690 participants) was 2.7 (2.5 to 3.0) and for ibuprofen 400 mg (6475 participants) it was 2.5 (2.4 to 2.6). The proportion with at least 50% pain relief was 46% with 200 mg and 54% with 400 mg. Remedication within 6 hours was less frequent with higher doses, with 48% remedicating with 200 mg and 42% with 400 mg. The median time to remedication was 4.7 hours with 200 mg and 5.4 hours with 400 mg. Sensitivity analysis indicated that pain model and ibuprofen formulation may both affect the result, with dental impaction models and soluble ibuprofen salts producing better efficacy estimates. Adverse events were uncommon, and not different from placebo.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2009-03-16 12:26:27 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The very substantial amount of high quality evidence demonstrates that ibuprofen is an effective analgesic in treating postoperative pain. NNTs for 200 mg and 400 mg ibuprofen did not change significantly from the previous review even when a substantial amount of new information was added. New information is provided on remedication. </P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2009-05-11 17:27:31 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review is an update of a previously published review in The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews on 'Single dose oral ibuprofen and diclofenac for postoperative pain' (<LINK REF="REF-Collins-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Collins 1999</LINK>). In this update it refers to ibuprofen only, and the title now states that the review is limited to adults. An updated review of single dose oral diclofenac in acute postoperative pain in adults has also been published (<LINK REF="REF-Derry-P-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Derry P 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>Acute pain occurs as a result of tissue damage either accidentally due to an injury or as a result of surgery. Acute postoperative pain is a manifestation of inflammation due to tissue injury. The management of postoperative pain and inflammation is a critical component of patient care. This is one of a series of reviews whose aim is to present evidence for relative analgesic efficacy through indirect comparisons with placebo, in very similar trials performed in a standard manner, with very similar outcomes, and over the same duration. Such relative analgesic efficacy does not in itself determine choice of drug for any situation or patient, but guides policy-making at the local level.</P>
<P>Recently published reviews include paracetamol (<LINK REF="REF-Toms-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Toms 2008</LINK>), celecoxib (<LINK REF="REF-Derry-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Derry 2008</LINK>), naproxen (<LINK REF="REF-Derry-C-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Derry C 2009</LINK>) and parecoxib (<LINK REF="REF-Lloyd-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lloyd 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>Single dose trials in acute pain are commonly short in duration, rarely lasting longer than 12 hours. The numbers of participants is small, allowing no reliable conclusions to be drawn about safety. To show that the analgesic is working it is necessary to use placebo (<LINK REF="REF-McQuay-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">McQuay 2005</LINK>). There are clear ethical considerations in doing this. These ethical considerations are answered by using acute pain situations where the pain is expected to go away, and by providing additional analgesia, commonly called rescue analgesia, if the pain has not diminished after about an hour. This is reasonable, because not all participants given an analgesic will have significant pain relief. Approximately 18% of participants given placebo will have significant pain relief (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2006</LINK>), and up to 50% may have inadequate analgesia with active medicines. The use of additional or rescue analgesia is hence important for all participants in the trials.</P>
<P>Clinical trials measuring the efficacy of analgesics in acute pain have been standardised over many years. Trials have to be randomised and double blind. Typically, in the first few hours or days after an operation, patients develop pain that is moderate to severe in intensity, and will then be given the test analgesic or placebo. Pain is measured using standard pain intensity scales immediately before the intervention, and then using pain intensity and pain relief scales over the following 4 to 6 hours for shorter acting drugs, and up to 12 or 24 hours for longer acting drugs. Pain relief of half the maximum possible pain relief or better (at least 50% pain relief) is typically regarded as a clinically useful outcome. For patients given rescue medication it is usual for no additional pain measurements to be made, and for all subsequent measures to be recorded as initial pain intensity or baseline (zero) pain relief (baseline observation carried forward). This process ensures that analgesia from the rescue medication is not wrongly ascribed to the test intervention. In some trials the last observation is carried forward, which gives an inflated response for the test intervention compared to placebo, but the effect has been shown to be negligible over 4 to 6 hours (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2005</LINK>). Patients usually remain in the hospital or clinic for at least the first 6 hours following the intervention, with measurements supervised, although they may then be allowed home to make their own measurements in trials of longer duration.</P>
<P>Clinicians prescribe non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) on a routine basis for a range of mild-to-moderate pain. NSAIDs are the most commonly prescribed analgesic medications worldwide, and their efficacy for treating acute pain has been well demonstrated (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2003</LINK>). They reversibly inhibit cyclooxygenase (prostaglandin endoperoxide synthase), the enzyme mediating production of prostaglandins and thromboxane A2 (<LINK REF="REF-FitzGerald-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">FitzGerald 2001</LINK>). Prostaglandins mediate a variety of physiological functions such as maintenance of the gastric mucosal barrier, regulation of renal blood flow, and regulation of endothelial tone. They also play an important role in inflammatory and nociceptive processes. However, relatively little is known about the mechanism of action of this class of compounds aside from their ability to inhibit cyclooxygenase-dependent prostanoid formation (<LINK REF="REF-Hawkey-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hawkey 1999</LINK>). Since NSAIDs do not depress respiration and do not impair gastro-intestinal motility as do opioids (<LINK REF="REF-BNF-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">BNF 2002</LINK>) they are clinically useful for treating pain after minor surgery and day surgery, and have an opiate-sparing effect after more major surgery (<LINK REF="REF-Grahame_x002d_Smith-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grahame-Smith 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>Ibuprofen was developed in the 1960s and is used extensively throughout the world for relief of pain and inflammation in both acute and chronic conditions. It is available over the counter in most countries, usually as 200 mg tablets, with 1200 mg as the recommended maximum daily dose for adults. Under medical supervision, up to 3200 mg daily may be taken, divided into three doses. The lysine salt of ibuprofen is more soluble in water, with some theoretical advantage for faster onset after oral administration, and with the possibility that it could be used intravenously. Intravenous ibuprofen lysine has been used for closure of patent ductus arteriosis in newborns (<LINK REF="REF-Aranda-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aranda 2006</LINK>). Topical formulations are also available over the counter, and are dealt with in other separate reviews.</P>
<P>In UK primary care in 2007 there were 4.5 million prescriptions for ibuprofen, most commonly for 400 mg tablets (2.6 million), but only 6800 for ibuprofen lysine (<LINK REF="REF-PACT-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">PACT 2007</LINK>). These numbers do not include over the counter sales, which are considerable, with over seven million packs sold annually in the UK in 2000, about 46,000 kg by weight (<LINK REF="REF-Sheen-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sheen 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>A major concern regarding the use of conventional NSAIDs postoperatively is the possibility of bleeding from both the operative site (because of the inhibition of platelet aggregation) (<LINK REF="REF-Forrest-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Forrest 2002</LINK>) and from the upper gastrointestinal tract, (especially in patients stressed by surgery, the elderly, frail, or dehydrated). Other potentially serious adverse events include acute liver injury, acute renal injury, heart failure, and adverse reproductive outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-Hernandez_x002d_Diaz-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hernandez-Diaz 2001</LINK>). However, such complications are more likely to occur with chronic use and NSAIDs generally present fewer risks if used in the short term, as in the treatment of postoperative pain (<LINK REF="REF-Rapoport-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rapoport 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>The previous review included 35 studies in 34 reports with 3591 participants. Ibuprofen was shown to be an effective analgesic at 200 mg and 400 mg, with numbers-needed-to-treat-to-benefit (NNTs) for at least 50% pain relief over 4 to 6 hours of 3.3 (95% confidence interval (CI) 2.8 to 4.0) and 2.7 (2.5 to 3.0) respectively. Adverse events were generally mild and transient and did not differ from placebo. A number of new studies are now available. The increased numbers of studies and participants gives more robust estimates of outcomes, and permits more detailed analysis of subgroups. This review has also looked at use of rescue medication as an additional measure of efficacy.</P>

<P>QUOROM guidelines were followed (<LINK REF="REF-Moher-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 1999</LINK>). For efficacy analyses we used the number of participants in each treatment group who were randomised, received medication, and provided at least one post-baseline assessment. For safety analyses we used number of participants who received study medication in each treatment group. Analyses were planned for different doses. Sensitivity analyses were planned for pain model (dental versus other postoperative pain), trial size (39 or fewer versus 40 or more per treatment arm), and quality score (two versus three or more), and formulation (standard tablet versus more soluble tablet or liquid preparations). A minimum of two studies and 200 participants were required for any analysis (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 1998</LINK>).</P>

<P>For each study, mean TOTPAR (total pain relief) or SPID (summed pain intensity difference) for active and placebo groups were converted to %maxTOTPAR or %maxSPID by division into the calculated maximum value (<LINK REF="REF-Cooper-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cooper 1991</LINK>). The proportion of participants in each treatment group who achieved at least 50%maxTOTPAR was calculated using verified equations (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moore-1997a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 1997a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moore-1997b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 1997b</LINK>). These proportions were then converted into the number of participants achieving at least 50%maxTOTPAR by multiplying by the total number of participants in the treatment group. Information on the number of participants with at least 50%maxTOTPAR for active treatment and placebo was then used to calculate relative benefit (RB) and NNT.<BR/>Pain measures accepted for the calculation of TOTPAR or SPID were:</P>
<UL>
<LI>five-point categorical pain relief (PR) scales with comparable wording to "none, slight, moderate, good or complete";</LI>
<LI>four-point categorical pain intensity (PI) scales with comparable wording to "none, mild, moderate, severe";</LI>

<P>Twelve studies reporting the primary outcome were in other types of surgery (including general, orthopaedic, abdominal, obstetric and gynaecological surgery) (Analysis 4.2.2). The proportion of participants with at least 50% pain relief was 48% (277/580) for ibuprofen 400 mg, and 22% (103/467) for placebo. The RB was 2.2 (1.8 to 2.6), and the NNT was 3.9 (3.2 to 5.0).</P>
<P>The 95% CIs for RB and NNT in dental and other surgery do not overlap, indicating that there was a significant difference for this outcome between dental and other types of surgery in these studies at 400 mg (z = 5.86, P &lt; 0.0001).</P>

<P>In all types of surgery, 17 studies used standard ibuprofen (Analysis 3.3.1). The proportion of participants with at least 50% pain relief was 41% (448/1094) for ibuprofen 200 mg, and 7% (67/1009) for placebo; the RB was 6.1 (4.8 to 7.7), and the NNT was 2.9 (2.7 to 3.2). In dental surgery only, 15 studies used standard ibuprofen (Analysis 3.4.1). The proportion of participants with at least 50% pain relief was 41% (406/984) for ibuprofen 200 mg, and 7% (62/899) for placebo; the RB was 5.9 (4.7 to 7.6), and the NNT was 2.9 (2.6 to 3.2).</P>
<P>Seven studies, all in dental surgery, used the lysine or arginine salts, or a preparation described as "soluble", all of which are thought to be more soluble and more readily absorbed (Analysis 3.3.2, Analysis 3.4.2). The corresponding proportion of participants with at least 50% pain relief was 56% (270/478) for ibuprofen 200 mg, and 10% (34/350) for placebo; the RB was 5.7 (4.2 to 7.9), and the NNT was 2.1 (1.9 to 2.4).</P>
<P>The more soluble salts of ibuprofen had significantly lower (better) NNTs than the standard preparation when all surgery was combined (z = 3.85, P &lt; 0.0001) and in dental studies only (z = 3.77, P &lt; 0.0002).</P>

In the seven studies in dental pain, the weighted mean proportion was 53% (215/402) with ibuprofen and 83% (243/292) with placebo, giving an NNTp of 3.4 (2.8 to 4.3) (<LINK REF="CMP-003.07" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.7</LINK>).</LI>
<LI>Twenty-eight studies using ibuprofen 400 mg reported the proportion of participants using rescue medication over 6 hours.

In the 22 studies in dental pain, the weighted mean proportion was 41% (628/1541) with ibuprofen and 80% (814/1013) with placebo, giving an NNTp of 2.5 (2.3 to 2.8) (<LINK REF="CMP-004.07" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.7</LINK>).</LI>
</UL>
<P>Only one study (<LINK REF="STD-Seymour-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Seymour 1996</LINK>) using ibuprofen 600 mg reported the proportion of participants using rescue medication, so no analysis was possible for the higher doses.</P>
<P>There was a trend towards a lower (better) NNTp with higher dose for all surgery combined, and for the dental studies alone (200 mg versus 400 mg all surgery: z = 2.53, P = 0.01; 200 mg versus 400 mg dental surgery z = 2.63, P = 0.009).</P>

<LI>In four dental studies using standard ibuprofen 200 mg, the weighted mean proportion of participants using rescue medication over 6 hours was 67% (116/173) with ibuprofen and 87% (150/172) with placebo, giving an NNTp of 5.0 (3.5 to 8.7) (Analysis 3.8.1). In four dental studies using soluble preparations of ibuprofen 200 mg, the weighted mean proportion of participants using rescue medication over 6 hours was 43% (99/229) with ibuprofen and 78% (93/120) with placebo, giving an NNTp of 2.9 (2.3 to 4.1) (Analysis 3.8.2).</LI>
<LI>In 18 dental studies using standard ibuprofen 400 mg, the weighted mean proportion of participants using rescue medication over 6 hours was 42% (455/1053) with ibuprofen and 80% (693/866) with placebo, giving an NNTp of 2.7 (2.4 to 3.0) (Analysis 4.8.1). In six dental studies using soluble preparations of ibuprofen 400 mg, the weighted mean proportion of participants using rescue medication over 6 hours was 34% (102/302) with ibuprofen and 78% (121/147) with placebo, giving an NNTp of 2.1 (1.8 to 2.5) (Analysis 4.8.2).</LI>

<P>At both doses fewer participants needed rescue medication over 6 hours with the soluble preparations than the standard preparation. The difference in NNTp was statistically significant for the 400 mg dose (z = 2.39, P = 0.017).</P>

<P>Participants who took rescue medication were classified as withdrawals due to lack of efficacy, and details are reported under "Use of rescue medication" above.</P>
<P>Withdrawals and exclusions were not reported consistently, particularly in older studies. Exclusions may not be of any particular consequence in single dose acute pain studies, where most exclusions result from patients not having moderate or severe pain (<LINK REF="REF-McQuay-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">McQuay 1982</LINK>). Withdrawals were sometimes reported without stating which treatment groups these referred to, or when withdrawals occurred, i.e., before assessment of analgesia at 4 to 6 hours, or at some other point before the end of the trial. Where details were given, withdrawals or exclusions were usually due to protocol violations or adverse events related to the surgical procedure.</P>
<P>A small number of withdrawals due to adverse events were reported. Amongst participants treated with ibuprofen 400 mg, two withdrew due to postoperative bleeding (<LINK REF="STD-Malmstrom-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Malmstrom 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zelenakas-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Zelenakas 2004</LINK>), one due to soreness and swelling (<LINK REF="STD-Fricke-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Fricke 1993</LINK>), and two due to vomiting (<LINK REF="STD-Malmstrom-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Malmstrom 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Singla-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Singla 2005</LINK>). One participant treated with ibuprofen 200 mg withdrew due to a headache, although the headache was present before dosing with the study drug (<LINK REF="STD-Kiersch-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Kiersch 1993</LINK>). In the five unpublished studies (<LINK REF="STD-Edwards-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Edwards 2002</LINK>), no more than three participants per treatment group withdrew because of adverse events; no further details were given. Amongst participants treated with placebo, three withdrew due to vomiting and anxiety (<LINK REF="STD-Cheung-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Cheung 2007</LINK>) and one due to postoperative bleeding (<LINK REF="STD-Frame-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Frame 1989</LINK>).

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2009-05-11 16:07:10 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jessica R Thomas">
<P>The original review of 35 studies in 34 reports included 2214 participants on ibuprofen and 1377 on placebo. This updated review doubles the number of studies, and more than doubles the number of participants, with 72 studies in 66 reports including 5804 participants on ibuprofen and 3382 on placebo. Most of the additional information came from 200 mg and 400 mg ibuprofen doses, and the bulk of the information is for these doses. There was a small amount of additional data for 50 mg and 100 mg, but not for doses higher than 400 mg, although 600 mg is a common dose of ibuprofen in some countries. The new information does not substantially change the result for the primary efficacy outcome, but provides more robust estimates with narrower confidence intervals, and permits more detailed subgroup analysis. Additionally, more attention has been paid to use of and time to additional analgesic requirement.</P>
<P>Overall studies were of good methodological quality. Three studies scored only the minimum for inclusion, one point each for stating they were randomised and double blind. It is possible that additional points were lost because of poor reporting rather than poor methods, and excluding these studies from the primary analysis did not change the results. No formal sensitivity analysis was possible. Almost all of the trials were of sufficiently high reporting quality to minimise reporting bias, and the amount of information such as to minimise any possible effect of publication bias.</P>
<P>NNTs for the primary outcome of at least 50% pain relief over 4 to 6 hours showed a trend for increasing efficacy with increasing dose over the range 100 to 400 mg. At doses of 50 and 100 mg, around 30% of those treated experience at least 50% pain relief, compared to about 10 to 15% with placebo. At 200 mg and 400 mg 46% and 55% experience this level of pain relief, giving NNTs of 2.7 (2.5 to 3.0) and 2.5 (2.4 to 2.7) respectively. Limited data for 600 mg and 800 mg are compatible with this trend. In dental studies only, the dose response was more marked, with a statistically significant difference between 200 mg and 400 mg (P &lt; 0.0005), and between 400 mg and 600/800 mg (P = 0.04), although with limited data. Dose response from indirect analyses like these has been confirmed by dose response within trials (<LINK REF="REF-McQuay-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">McQuay 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>Indirect comparisons of NNTs for at least 50% pain relief over 4 to 6 hours in reviews of other analgesics using identical methods indicate that ibuprofen 200 mg has equivalent efficacy to naproxen 500/550 mg (2.7 (2.3 to 3.2)) (<LINK REF="REF-Derry-C-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Derry C 2009</LINK>) and lumiracoxib 400 mg (2.7 (2.2 to 3.5)) (<LINK REF="REF-Roy-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roy 2007</LINK>), while ibuprofen 400 mg has equivalent efficacy to aspirin 1200 mg (2.4 (1.9 to 3.2)) (<LINK REF="REF-Oldman-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oldman 1999</LINK>) and oxycodone 10 mg plus paracetamol 650 mg (2.5 (2.0 to 3.3)) (<LINK REF="REF-Edwards-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Edwards 2000</LINK>). Both doses are better than paracetamol 1000 mg (3.6 (3.2 to 4.1)) (<LINK REF="REF-Toms-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Toms 2008</LINK>), but worse than rofecoxib (2.2 (1.9 to 2.4) (<LINK REF="REF-Barden-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barden 2005</LINK>). A current listing of reviews of analgesics in the single dose postoperative pain model can be found at <A HREF="http://www.medicine.ox.ac.uk/bandolier/index.html">www.medicine.ox.ac.uk/bandolier/index.html</A>.</P>
<P>Comparison of dental and other types of surgery demonstrated lower (better) NNTs for at least 50% pain relief compared with placebo in dental studies. This difference was statistically significant for ibuprofen 400 mg (P &lt; 0.0001), but not 200 mg, where there were only two studies (220 participants) in non-dental surgery. It has previously been difficult to demonstrate a difference in efficacy between dental and other types of surgery (<LINK REF="REF-Barden-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barden 2004</LINK>), although a recent review of diclofenac did demonstrate a similar difference with limited amounts of data (<LINK REF="REF-Derry-P-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Derry P 2009</LINK>). It may be that there is indeed a difference, but previous data sets have been too small to show statistical significance. In this review "other" types of surgery were diverse, including orthopaedic, abdominal and hernia surgery, tonsillectomy and episiotomy. Both the extent of the surgery and the context (e.g. perinatal hormonal changes) may influence the perception of pain and make this a highly heterogeneous group. There have never been sufficient data for any one type of "other" surgery to compare with dental surgery.</P>
<P>We carried out all further sensitivity analyses on the large and clinically more homogenous data set of dental studies using ibuprofen 200 and 400 mg. Study size had no statistically significant or consistent effect on efficacy, although as expected, smaller studies gave more variable results (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>A number of studies used ibuprofen preparations that are more soluble than standard ibuprofen, and were developed primarily to speed up absorption and onset of action. We combined these preparations for comparison of efficacy with standard ibuprofen. At both 200 mg and 400 mg the soluble preparations had better efficacy in dental studies (P &lt; 0.0002 and P &lt; 0.0001 respectively). Whether soluble formulations provide important clinical benefits, and whether the pharmacodynamic results accord with pharmacokinetic properties of the different formulations is beyond the scope of this review, but it is important to note the power of the systematic review to reveal these differences.</P>
<P>It has been suggested that data on use of rescue medication, whether as a proportion of participants requiring it, or the median time to use of it, might be helpful in assessing the usefulness of an analgesic, and possibly distinguishing between different doses (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2005</LINK>). This review demonstrated a non-significant trend for fewer participants to need rescue medication within 6 hours with higher doses of ibuprofen over the range 50 to 400 mg. For dental studies only, the trend was more obvious, with about 60% using rescue medication with ibuprofen 100 mg, 50% with 200 mg, and 40% with 400 mg, compared with about 80% with placebo over the 6 hour period. It was also possible to demonstrate that the proportion of participants using rescue medication was lower in those treated with "soluble" salts than with standard ibuprofen for the 200 mg and 400 mg doses.</P>
<P>Additionally, the median time to use of rescue medication increased with higher doses, from 4.7 hours with 200 mg to 5.6 hours with 400 mg. Both of these results indicate that the higher doses give more prolonged pain relief than lower doses. Longer duration of action may be advantageous in some circumstances. In a postoperative setting, where patients may feel nauseated, a longer time before remedication is needed may be of benefit to the patient, and it may also reduce demands on time for nursing staff. Duration of action may also be a useful outcome with which to compare different analgesics. The full implications of the importance of remedication as an outcome awaits completion of other reviews, allowing examination of a substantial body of evidence.</P>
<P>Reporting of data for adverse events, withdrawals (other than lack of efficacy) or exclusions, and handling of missing data was not always complete, although it did appear to be better in the more recent studies. Adverse events were collected using various methods (questioning, patient diary) over different periods of time. This may have included periods after the use of rescue medication, which may cause its own adverse events. Poor reporting of adverse events in acute pain trials has been noted before (<LINK REF="REF-Edwards-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Edwards 1999</LINK>). The usefulness of single dose studies for assessing adverse events is questionable, but it is non-the-less reassuring that there was no difference between ibuprofen (at any dose) and placebo for occurrence of any adverse event, and that serious adverse events and adverse event withdrawals were rare, and generally not thought to be related to the test drug. Long term multiple dose studies should be used for meaningful analysis of adverse events since, even in acute pain settings, analgesics are likely to be used in multiple doses. The difficulty will be that the postoperative setting is one in which there are many sequelae of surgery and anaesthesia that manifest as adverse events, like nausea, vomiting, or abdominal discomfort, while others, like headache, can be caused by acute caffeine withdrawal over the postoperative period. The main issue is that of rare but serious adverse events, and these are more likely to be found in large observational studies.</P>
<P>Lack of information about withdrawals or exclusions may have led to an overestimate of efficacy, but the effect is probably not significant because it is as likely to be related to poor reporting as poor methods. In single dose studies most exclusions occur for protocol violations such as failing to meet baseline pain requirements, or failing to return for post treatment visits after the acute pain results are concluded. Where patients are treated with a single dose of medication and observed, often "on site" for the duration of the trial, it might be considered unnecessary to report on "withdrawals" if there were none. For missing data it has been shown that over the 4 to 6 hour period, there is no difference between baseline observation carried forward, which gives the more conservative estimate, and last observation carried forward (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2005</LINK>).</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2009-05-11 16:07:35 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jessica R Thomas">
<P>This updated review does not change the overall primary estimate of efficacy, the NNT for at least 50% pain relief over 4 to 6 hours compared with placebo, but does demonstrate differences in efficacy with different formulations, and provides additional estimates of efficacy in terms of use of rescue medication.</P>
<P>A single dose of ibuprofen 400 mg is an effective analgesic, providing at least 50% pain relief to over half of the treated patients with acute, moderate to severe, postoperative pain. The NNT of 2.5 for at least 50% pain relief compares favourably with other analgesics commonly used for postoperative pain. In single dose, it is associated with a low rate of adverse events, similar to that with placebo. Lower doses provide slightly lower levels of analgesia. The 200 mg dose has a shorter duration of action. The more soluble salts of ibuprofen appear to offer better analgesia for a longer time. The amount of information available for 200 mg and 400 mg dwarfs almost all other analgesics except paracetamol and aspirin.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2008-10-28 19:31:27 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The most important implication for research is to clarify the apparent difference in efficacy between the standard and more soluble preparations of ibuprofen. A preparation with better efficacy than standard ibuprofen may present an opportunity to provide equivalent analgesia at a reduced dose, and potentially improve safety in longer term use. It should always be the goal to use the lowest dose of a drug that provides the desired clinical effect, and lower doses are likely to be associated with fewer adverse events in clinical practice.</P>

<P>We performed a restricted search in June 2017. We are aware of some additional relevant studies, but given the existing wealth of information, the large numbers of studies and participants, the stability of the efficacy estimate over time, and the fact that due attention has been given to issues over formulation, it is unlikely that any update will change the conclusions. Therefore, this review has now been stabilised following discussion with the authors and editors. If appropriate, we will update the review if new evidence likely to change the conclusions is published, or if standards change substantially which necessitate major revisions.<BR/>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Categorical rating scale:</HEADING>
<P>The commonest is the five category scale (none, slight, moderate, good or lots, and complete). For analysis numbers are given to the verbal categories (for pain intensity, none = 0, mild = 1, moderate = 2 and severe = 3, and for relief none = 0, slight = 1, moderate = 2, good or lots = 3 and complete = 4). Data from different subjects is then combined to produce means (rarely medians) and measures of dispersion (usually standard errors of means). The validity of converting categories into numerical scores was checked by comparison with concurrent visual analogue scale measurements. Good correlation was found, especially between pain relief scales using cross-modality matching techniques. Results are usually reported as continuous data, mean or median pain relief or intensity. Few studies present results as discrete data, giving the number of participants who report a certain level of pain intensity or relief at any given assessment point. The main advantages of the categorical scales are that they are quick and simple. The small number of descriptors may force the scorer to choose a particular category when none describes the pain satisfactorily.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">VAS:</HEADING>
<P>Visual analogue scale: lines with left end labelled "no relief of pain" and right end labelled "complete relief of pain", seem to overcome this limitation. Patients mark the line at the point which corresponds to their pain. The scores are obtained by measuring the distance between the no relief end and the patient's mark, usually in millimetres. The main advantages of VAS are that they are simple and quick to score, avoid imprecise descriptive terms and provide many points from which to choose. More concentration and coordination are needed, which can be difficult post-operatively or with neurological disorders.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">TOTPAR:</HEADING>
<P>Total pain relief (TOTPAR) is calculated as the sum of pain relief scores over a period of time. If a patient had complete pain relief immediately after taking an analgesic, and maintained that level of pain relief for six hours, they would have a six-hour TOTPAR of the maximum of 24. Differences between pain relief values at the start and end of a measurement period are dealt with by the composite trapezoidal rule. This is a simple method that approximately calculates the definite integral of the area under the pain relief curve by calculating the sum of the areas of several trapezoids that together closely approximate to the area under the curve.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">SPID:</HEADING>
<P>Summed pain intensity difference (SPID) is calculated as the sum of the differences between the pain scores over a period of time. Differences between pain intensity values at the start and end of a measurement period are dealt with by the trapezoidal rule.</P>
<P>VAS TOTPAR and VAS SPID are visual analogue versions of TOTPAR and SPID.</P>
