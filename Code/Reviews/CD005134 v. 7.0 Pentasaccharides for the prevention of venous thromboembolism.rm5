<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a condition in which people develop blood clots in their veins. It includes deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and the potentially fatal pulmonary embolism (PE). VTE occurs in more than 10% of patients in hospital and is the third most frequent cause of death among them. Therefore, effective prevention is necessary for people who are at high risk of VTE. The standard method of prevention involves use of an anticoagulant, for example, low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) or warfarin, among orthopaedic patients. In recent years, another type of anticoagulant, pentasaccharide, has shown good anticoagulative effect in clinical trials. Three types of pentasaccharides are available, namely, short-acting fondaparinux, long-acting idraparinux and idrabiotaparinux.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>Our systematic review included 25 studies involving 21,004 participants (current until March 2016). We found no studies on long-acting idraparinux nor idrabiotaparinux for prevention of VTE. Therefore, we included only studies on short-acting fondaparinux for prevention of VTE.</P>
<P>Moderate to high quality evidence shows that fondaparinux is effective for short-term prevention of VTE when compared with placebo. It can reduce total VTE, DVT, total PE and symptomatic VTE and shows no difference in the number of deaths when compared with placebo. Low to moderate quality evidence shows that fondaparinux is effective for short-term prevention of VTE when compared with LMWH. It can reduce total VTE and total DVT and shows no difference in the number of deaths when compared with LMWH. At the same time, however, fondaparinux increases major bleeding when compared with placebo and LMWH. Therefore, when fondaparinux is chosen for the prevention of VTE, attention should be paid to the person's bleeding risk. Most of the data were obtained from studies on patients undergoing orthopaedic surgery. Therefore, the conclusion pertains predominantly to these patients. Data on fondaparinux for other medical conditions such as internal, medical and abdominal surgery are sparse.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of evidence</B>
</P>
<P>We downgraded the quality of the evidence because of small numbers of events causing imprecision, and differences and inconsistency between studies. We need additional high-quality clinical trials to confirm the efficacy and safety of fondaparinux.<BR/>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2016-10-27 14:29:58 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a common condition with potentially serious and life-threatening consequences. The standard method of thromboprophylaxis uses an anticoagulant such as low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) or warfarin. In recent years, another type of anticoagulant, pentasaccharide, an indirect factor Xa inhibitor, has shown good anticoagulative effect in clinical trials. Three types of pentasaccharides are available: short-acting fondaparinux, long-acting idraparinux and idrabiotaparinux. Pentasaccharides cause little heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and are better tolerated than unfractionated heparin, LMWH and warfarin. However, no consensus has been reached on whether pentasaccharides are superior or inferior to other anticoagulative methods.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-10-27 14:29:58 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included in this review 25 studies with a total of 21,004 participants. All investigated fondaparinux for VTE prevention; none investigated idraparinux or idrabiotaparinux. Studies included participants undergoing abdominal surgery, thoracic surgery, bariatric surgery or coronary bypass surgery; acutely ill hospitalised medical patients; people requiring rigid or semirigid immobilisation; and those with superficial venous thrombosis. Most studies focused on orthopaedic patients. We lowered the quality of the evidence because of heterogeneity between studies and a small number of events causing imprecision.</P>
<P>When comparing fondaparinux with placebo, we found less total VTE (risk ratio (RR) 0.24, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.15 to 0.38; 5717 participants; 8 studies; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 64%; P &lt; 0.00001), less symptomatic VTE (RR 0.15, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.36; 6503 participants; 8 studies; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%; P &lt; 0.0001), less total DVT (RR 0.25, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.40; 5715 participants; 8 studies; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 67%; P &lt; 0.00001), less proximal DVT (RR 0.12, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.39; 2746 participants; 7 studies; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 64%; P = 0.0004) and less total pulmonary embolism (PE) (RR 0.16, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.62; 6412 participants; 8 studies; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%; P = 0.008) in the fondaparinux group. The quality of the evidence was moderate for total VTE, total DVT and proximal DVT, and high for symptomatic VTE and total PE.</P>
<P>When fondaparinux was compared with LMWH, analyses indicated that fondaparinux reduced total VTE and DVT (RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.42 to 0.73; 9339 participants; 11 studies; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 64%; P &lt; 0.0001; and RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.71; 9356 participants; 10 studies; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 67%; P &lt; 0.0001, respectively), and showed a trend toward reduced proximal DVT (RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.33 to 1.02; 8361 participants; 9 studies; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 53%; P = 0.06). Symptomatic VTE (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.63; 12240 participants; 9 studies; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 35%; P = 0.90) and total PE (RR 1.24, 95% CI 0.65 to 2.34; 12350 participants; 10 studies; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%; P = 0.51) indicated no difference between fondaparinux and LMWH. The quality of the evidence was moderate for total VTE, symptomatic VTE, total DVT and total PE, and low for proximal DVT.</P>
<P>We showed that fondaparinux increased major bleeding compared with both placebo and LWMH (RR 2.56, 95% CI 1.48 to 4.44; 6659 participants; 8 studies; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%; P = 0.0008; moderate-quality evidence; and RR 1.38, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.75; 12,501 participants; 11 studies; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 24%; P = 0.008; high-quality evidence, respectively). All-cause mortality was not different between fondaparinux and placebo or LMWH (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.48 to 1.22; 6674 participants; 8 studies; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 14%; P = 0.26; moderate-quality evidence; and RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.22; 12,400 participants; 11 studies; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%; P = 0.44; moderate-quality evidence, respectively).</P>
<P>One study compared fondaparinux with variable and fixed (1 mg per day) doses of warfarin after elective hip or knee replacement surgery and showed no difference in primary and secondary outcomes between fondaparinux and both variable and fixed doses of warfarin. The quality of the evidence was very low. One small study compared fondaparinux with edoxaban in patients with severe renal impairment undergoing lower-limb orthopaedic surgery and reported no thromboembolic events, major bleeding events or deaths in either group. The quality of the evidence was very low. One small study compared fondaparinux with mechanical thromboprophylaxis. Results showed no difference in total VTE and total DVT between fondaparinux and mechanical thromboprophylaxis. This study reported no cases pertaining to the other outcomes of this review. The quality of the evidence was low.</P>
<P>There were insufficient studies to permit meaningful conclusions for subgroups of clinical conditions other than orthopaedic surgery.</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2016-10-27 14:29:58 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Moderate to high quality evidence shows that fondaparinux is effective for short-term prevention of VTE when compared with placebo.

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2016-10-27 14:29:58 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Venous thromboembolism (VTE), including deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), is a prevalent disease with potentially serious consequences. A major life-threatening complication for patients with VTE is that parts of the thrombus, called emboli, can break off and travel to the lungs, eventually leading to sudden collapse and death. Even in patients without such an acute condition, emboli can cause pulmonary hypertension and post-thrombotic syndrome over the longer term, leading to chronic swelling and ulceration of the skin. Venous thromboembolism has become the third most frequent cause of death and the most common preventable cause of death in hospital (<LINK REF="REF-Agnelli-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Agnelli 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Geerts-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Geerts 2008</LINK>). The incidence of VTE is about seven per 10,000 person-years among community residents (<LINK REF="REF-Heit-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heit 2001</LINK>). The incidence of DVT is five per 10-000 person-years and rises exponentially with increasing age (<LINK REF="REF-Fowkes-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fowkes 2003</LINK>). The relapse rate of DVT is variable and depends mainly on the risk factor profile of patients. For patients with symptomatic and proximal DVT, the recurrence rate is over 20% after five years of initial treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Hansson-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hansson 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pinede-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pinede 2001</LINK>). Among hospitalised patients, the incidence of VTE is more than 100 times greater than among community residents (<LINK REF="REF-Heit-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heit 2001</LINK>), and the prevalence of fatal PE is approximately 1% (<LINK REF="REF-Geerts-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Geerts 2004</LINK>). Venous thromboembolism has become the third most frequent cause of death among patients in hospital in the United States (<LINK REF="REF-Heit-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heit 2005</LINK>). Therefore, prevention of VTE among those at risk is important for reducing morbidity and mortality (<LINK REF="REF-Geerts-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Geerts 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>Until relatively recently, the main pharmacological options for treatment and prevention of thromboembolic disorders were warfarin and heparin (unfractionated heparin or low molecular weight heparin). However, the principal disadvantage of using unfractionated heparin involves its unpredictable pharmacological effect, which requires close monitoring. Disadvantages of warfarin and other vitamin K antagonists include a narrow therapeutic window, numerous drug interactions and the need for close monitoring. Although low molecular weight heparins (LMWHs) could be superior to unfractionated heparins because monitoring of coagulation is not needed and LMWHs have a better safety record (<LINK REF="REF-Erkens-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Erkens 2010</LINK>), problems associated with their use include bleeding, hypersensitivity and heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). New oral anticoagulants - direct factor X inhibitors and direct thrombin inhibitors - may be as effective as traditional anticoagulants without the need for monitoring but may cause more bleeding (<LINK REF="REF-Southworth-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Southworth 2013</LINK>) and are associated with other adverse effects (<LINK REF="REF-Uchino-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Uchino 2012</LINK>); data are still insufficient to fully understand their effects (<LINK REF="REF-Metzger-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Metzger 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Salazar-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Salazar 2010</LINK>). In addition, DVT may occur despite prophylaxis with LMWH or other agents (<LINK REF="REF-Geerts-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Geerts 2001</LINK>). Other non-pharmacological methods, including thromboembolic deterrent (TED) stockings and pneumatic calf compression devices, are safe but are not effective enough to be used alone (<LINK REF="REF-Geerts-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Geerts 2001</LINK>). These unresolved issues have led to continued research into potentially effective and safe anticoagulants - pentasaccharides (<LINK REF="REF-Koopman-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Koopman 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Turpie-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Turpie 2003</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2016-10-27 14:29:57 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Pentasaccharide are a new class of agents with a specific effect on the blood coagulation cascade; they may be more effective and may cause fewer side effects than LMWH (<LINK REF="REF-Bauer-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bauer 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Koopman-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Koopman 2003</LINK>). The structure of the pentasaccharide is modelled on the pentasaccharide sequence in heparin, which binds to antithrombin-III, but it is modified to have higher affinity (<LINK REF="REF-Bauer-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bauer 2003</LINK>). Once bound, antithrombin-III undergoes a conformational change and binds to factor Xa. This inhibits the coagulation cascade because factor Xa is positioned at the start of the common pathway of the intrinsic and extrinsic systems and results in effective inhibition of thrombin generation (<LINK REF="REF-Bauer-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bauer 2003</LINK>). As no direct interference with components of the coagulation cascade occurs, these agents have been proposed to be less likely to cause haemorrhagic complications whilst possessing equivalent or superior efficacy when compared with LMWH (<LINK REF="REF-Koopman-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Koopman 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shoda-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shoda 2015</LINK>).</P>
<P>Currently, three types of pentasaccharides are used for VTE prophylaxis. One type is fondaparinux, which has a half-life time of approximately 15 hours and can be administered subcutaneously once daily. A systematic review on fondaparinux for acute coronary syndrome showed a better anticoagulative effect, less major bleeding and reduced total mortality when compared with LMWH (<LINK REF="REF-Brito-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brito 2011</LINK>). The second type is the long-acting pentasaccharide idraparinux, which has a half-life time of approximately 120 hours when administered for the first time, which increases to 60 days when metabolism has been in steady state (<LINK REF="REF-Veyrat_x002d_Follet-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Veyrat-Follet 2009</LINK>). With its long half-life time, idraparinux can be administered subcutaneously once weekly and can greatly improve patients' tolerance and quality of life. On the other hand, the anticoagulative effect may accumulate and bleeding risk may increase after long-term administration. If acute major bleeding takes place during idraparinux injection, it will be difficult to reverse its anticoagulative effect because no specific rescuer is available. For this reason, a new medicine called idrabiotaparinux was developed by the pharmaceutical company Sanofi-Aventis. It is a compound of idraparinux and biotin that can be neutralised immediately by the external agent avidin. When avidin is administered, it binds rapidly to idrabiotaparinux, and the avidin&#8211;idrabiotaparinux complex is rapidly cleared from plasma to tissues in which avidin normally resides, resulting in a rapid decrease in circulating anti-factor Xa activity (<LINK REF="REF-Paty-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Paty 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Savi-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Savi 2008</LINK>). No relevant toxicity or adverse effects of avidin have been reported in safety pharmacology and toxicology studies (<LINK REF="REF-Stoldt-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stoldt 1997</LINK>). Paty and colleagues reported that avidin is effective in reversing the anticoagulative effect of idrabiotaparinux (<LINK REF="REF-Paty-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Paty 2010</LINK>).</P>

<P>Pentasaccharides have longer half-life times with no need for monitoring coagulation time, and they cause little HIT so are more tolerable than the traditional unfractionated heparin, LMWH or warfarin. However, in terms of beneficial effects and adverse effects in VTE prevention, although many clinical trials have compared them with other anticoagulative methods (medical, mechanical or combined), no consensus has been reached on whether they are superior or inferior to other anticoagulative methods (<LINK REF="REF-Bauersachs-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bauersachs 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bergqvist-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bergqvist 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Falck_x002d_Ytter-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Falck-Ytter 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Prandoni-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Prandoni 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Turpie-2003a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Turpie 2003a</LINK>). Therefore, we conducted this systematic review to assess beneficial and adverse effects of pentasaccharides for VTE prevention.</P>

<P>Two review authors (YS and XL or KD) independently assessed the methodological quality of included trials and resolved discrepancies by discussion. If agreement could not be reached, JD arbitrated. We used the Cochrane recommended tool for assessing risk of bias (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). This tool comprises seven specific domains (namely, sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding of participants and personnel, blinding of outcome assessment, incomplete outcome data, selective outcome reporting and 'other bias'). Each domain in the tool included one or more specific entries in a 'Risk of bias' table. Within each entry, the first part of the tool described what was reported to have happened in the study and whether sufficient detail was provided to support a judgement about risk of bias. The second part of the tool assigned a judgement related to risk of bias for that entry by assigning a judgement of 'low risk' of bias, 'high risk' of bias or 'unclear risk' of bias (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). We stratified studies into two groups - a 'low risk' of bias group and a 'high risk' of bias group. We stratified in the 'low risk' of bias group studies that showed 'low risk' of bias in all of the sequence generation, allocation concealment and blinding of outcome assessment domains; if any of the three domains could not be achieved, we classified the study into the 'high risk' of bias group. We considered other domains as well. If other risks of bias would obviously affect the calculated intervention effect substantially, we classified the outcome into the 'high risk' of bias group. For outcomes with information insufficient for classification into the 'low risk' of bias or 'high risk' of bias group, we tried to contact study authors to obtain the original data, attempted to find additional information in other published articles of the same study or used other methods that would be helpful in obtaining sufficient data to clarify the bias. If information was still insufficient, we decided to classify studies into the 'low risk' of bias or 'high risk' of bias group through discussion. We pooled only data from 'low risk' of bias groups in the meta-analyses.</P>

<P>In our protocol, we had planned to analyse the short-term acting pentasaccharides and the long-term acting pentasaccharides as subgroups. However, our searches identified that short-term acting pentasaccharides were used only for primary VTE prevention and were administered once daily for a period of approximately one month, but long-term acting pentasaccharides were used only for VTE treatment and were administered once weekly for several months. Participants and treatment duration were different for the two kinds of pentasaccharide studies. We therefore analysed studies on short-term acting pentasaccharides for VTE prevention and excluded studies on long-term acting pentasaccharides from the meta-analyses without performing tests for heterogeneity. We also performed subgroup analyses on different surgical clinical conditions.</P>

Investigators in the <LINK REF="STD-EFFORT" TYPE="STUDY">EFFORT</LINK> study administered 5 mg/d fondaparinux in the study arm and 40 mg enoxaparin twice daily in the control arm after participants had undergone bariatric surgery. Doses of fondaparinux and enoxaparin used by <LINK REF="STD-EFFORT" TYPE="STUDY">EFFORT</LINK> were double those used for prevention of VTE in other included studies for other types of patients.

We used <LINK REF="STD-Yokote-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Yokote 2011</LINK> only for the sensitivity analysis, as described above. Another reason for including these studies was that they included large samples. If we excluded these from the meta-analysis, the result would be biased. In <LINK REF="STD-Bern-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Bern 2015</LINK>, participants had early postoperative ambulation. All participants wore pneumatic compression stockings while in-patients. Elastic compression stockings were prescribed to be used after discharge until follow-up ultrasonography. Hydroxyethyl starch (HES) 6% was allowed intraoperatively for case-specific reasons. Use of platelet function suppressive drugs, such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), was discouraged but not prohibited by the protocol. As <LINK REF="STD-Bern-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Bern 2015</LINK> was the single study comparing fondaparinux and warfarin for VTE prevention, we included this study to present its results. <LINK REF="STD-Fuji-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Fuji 2015</LINK> allowed concomitant physiotherapy (intermittent pneumatic compression devices or elastic stockings) throughout the treatment period. <LINK REF="STD-AR3106116" TYPE="STUDY">AR3106116</LINK> compared the efficacy of fondaparinux versus IPC for VTE prevention in patients undergoing abdominal surgery who were at high risk of VTE, so the two groups in this study received fondaparinux injection and IPC treatment separately.</P>

As the outcomes total VTE, total DVT and proximal DVT showed significant heterogeneity, we analysed the data by using the random-effects model. Remaining outcomes (symptomatic VTE, total PE, fatal PE, non-fatal PE, major bleeding, fatal bleeding, MI, all causes of death, other serious adverse effects) showed low heterogeneity and were analysed with the fixed-effect model. Our results showed less total VTE (RR 0.24, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.38; P &lt; 0.00001; 8 studies; 5717 participants), less symptomatic VTE (RR 0.15, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.36; P &lt; 0.0001; 8 studies; 6503 participants), less total DVT (RR 0.25, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.40; P &lt; 0.00001; 8 studies; 5715 participants), less proximal DVT (RR 0.12, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.39; P = 0.0004; 7 studies; 2746 participants) and less total PE (RR 0.16, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.62; P = 0.008; 8 studies; 6412 participants) for fondaparinux compared with placebo. All PE events were symptomatic.

We combined the first 11 studies into meta-analyses. Total VTE, total DVT and proximal DVT outcomes showed significant heterogeneity; therefore, we used the random-effects model. Outcomes of symptomatic VTE, total PE, fatal PE, non-fatal PE, major bleeding, fatal bleeding, all causes of death, MI and other serious adverse effects showed low heterogeneity; therefore, we used the fixed-effect model for analyses of these variables. The heterogeneity assessment of symptomatic VTE showed a P value for the Chi-squared test of 0.16 and an I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic of 35%; after discussion, we decided to analyse this outcome by using the fixed-effect model. Results showed that fondaparinux reduced VTE and DVT (RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.42 to 0.73; P &lt; 0.0001; 11 studies; 9339 participants; and RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.71; P &lt; 0.0001; 10 studies; 9356 participants, respectively) and showed a trend towards reduced proximal DVT (RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.33 to 1.02; P = 0.06; 9 studies; 8361 participants). <LINK REF="STD-EPHESUS" TYPE="STUDY">EPHESUS</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-PEGASUS" TYPE="STUDY">PEGASUS</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-PENTAMAKS" TYPE="STUDY">PENTAMAKS</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-PENTATHLON" TYPE="STUDY">PENTATHLON</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-PENTATHLON-2000" TYPE="STUDY">PENTATHLON 2000</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-PENTHIFRA" TYPE="STUDY">PENTHIFRA</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Li-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Li 2015</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-EFFORT" TYPE="STUDY">EFFORT</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-FONDACAST" TYPE="STUDY">FONDACAST</LINK> reported symptomatic VTE.

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-10-28 07:59:08 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included in this review 25 studies with a total of 21,004 participants; all investigated fondaparinux for venous thromboembolism (VTE) prevention, and no studies examined idraparinux or idrabiotaparinux for prevention of VTE.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Fondaparinux versus placebo</HEADING>
<P>Our results show that compared with placebo, fondaparinux reduced VTE events for people needing VTE prevention. Effects of fondaparinux were consistent in nearly all efficacy outcomes and in most of the included studies. <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK> shows that the quality of the evidence was moderate for total VTE. Therefore, we can conclude that fondaparinux is effective for VTE prevention. Results also demonstrate that fondaparinux reduced symptomatic VTE, total deep venous thrombosis (DVT), proximal DVT and total pulmonary embolism (PE), and the quality of evidence for these analyses was moderate or high, indicating that fondaparinux is effective for VTE prevention. At the same time, however, our results show that fondaparinux increased major bleeding compared with placebo. The quality of the evidence was moderate. This finding is significant, as major bleeding is vital for assessing the safety of anticoagulants. As a result, we consider that caution is warranted when fondaparinux is used in people who are at high risk of bleeding. In the analyses of all causes of death, we did not show a difference in numbers of deaths between fondaparinux and placebo. Sensitivity analyses did not change these results.</P>
<P>In subgroup analyses for different clinical conditions, we included only one study in the medically ill and superficial thrombophlebitis subgroups, respectively. Therefore, information was insufficient to permit conclusions on the efficacy and safety of fondaparinux for different clinical conditions. In the medically ill patients subgroup, fondaparinux caused fewer deaths than were caused by placebo (P = 0.06). However, we included only one study (<LINK REF="STD-ARTEMIS" TYPE="STUDY">ARTEMIS</LINK>), and, as a result, evidence was insufficient to show a real trend. The medically ill patients group is a special group of patients that usually consists of more seriously ill and bedridden patients. In such a clinical setting, fondaparinux may have a larger effect. Our analyses (<LINK REF="CMP-004.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.1</LINK>) show that fondaparinux significantly reduced total VTE, with a P value of 0.02 compared with placebo, in the medically ill patients subgroup. However, according to available evidence, the reduced VTE rate failed to significantly improve the survival rate. In addition, the small number of included studies did not allow us to draw conclusions. We need additional randomised controlled trials (RCTs) to assess whether fondaparinux can reduce mortality among medically ill patients. In the surgery patients subgroup analyses, only <LINK REF="STD-APOLLO" TYPE="STUDY">APOLLO</LINK> investigated patients undergoing abdominal surgery, only <LINK REF="STD-Kolluri-2016" TYPE="STUDY">Kolluri 2016</LINK> investigated those undergoing bariatric surgery and the remaining four studies investigated orthopaedic patients. Consequently, it is suggested that fondaparinux is effective for VTE prevention among orthopaedic patients, although the evidence for patients undergoing other types of surgery remains insufficient. This may be the case because it is common for orthopaedic surgeons to give anticoagulation treatment to immobilised patients. At the same time, it is not usual for surgeons from other departments to administer anticoagulative medicine to prevent VTE in immobilised patients after surgery. We need additional high-quality studies on fondaparinux for VTE prevention among people in clinical settings other than orthopaedics.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Fondaparinux versus low molecular weight heparin (LMWH)</HEADING>
<P>We demonstrated that total VTE was reduced in the fondaparinux group compared with the LMWH group, but symptomatic VTE was not different. Results indicate that fondaparinux decreased only non-symptomatic VTE compared with LMWH. As the importance of non-symptomatic isolated distal DVT remains unclear, most studies cannot show a significant increase in mortality or in the incidence of post-thrombotic syndrome (<LINK REF="REF-Palareti-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Palareti 2012</LINK>). In addition, the quality of evidence for the efficacy analyses was moderate or low. See <LINK REF="SOF-02" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 2</LINK>. We showed a tendency for fondaparinux to reduce proximal DVT compared with LMWH (P = 0.06). According to <LINK REF="REF-Hansson-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hansson 2000</LINK>, asymptomatic proximal DVT causes significantly more deaths compared with both asymptomatic distal DVT and no DVT; therefore, targeting of asymptomatic proximal DVT is an appropriate endpoint in future clinical studies of venous thromboprophylaxis. Moreover, our results show that fondaparinux increased the major bleeding rate. In terms of safety, fondaparinux was inferior to LMWH. In summary, on the basis of available evidence, we conclude that fondaparinux may be more effective than LMWH for VTE prevention, but it increases the major bleeding rate, which limits its usefulness.</P>
<P>Similar to the fondaparinux versus placebo subgroup analysis, we included only one study in the abdominal surgery and ICU patients subgroups, respectively, and the subgroup result was not significantly different from the total result. Therefore, we cannot draw conclusions regarding the superiority or inferiority of fondaparinux compared with LMWH in different clinical conditions for VTE prophylaxis.</P>

<P>Only one study (<LINK REF="STD-Bern-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Bern 2015</LINK>) compared fondaparinux versus variable warfarin (target INR 2 to 2.5) and 1 mg once daily warfarin for VTE prevention among patients who have undergone elective hip or knee replacement surgery. This study was small, and reported efficacy and safety outcomes were rare. Only one study (<LINK REF="STD-Fuji-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Fuji 2015</LINK>) compared fondaparinux with edoxaban. Thus the evidence on fondaparinux compared with anticoagulants other than LMWH for VTE prevention was insufficient to allow any conclusions. Additional studies are needed.</P>
<P>Only one small study (<LINK REF="STD-AR3106116" TYPE="STUDY">AR3106116</LINK>) with a short duration of eight days compared fondaparinux versus mechanical thromboprophylaxis. Evidence was insufficient to allow any conclusions. Additional studies are needed for this comparison.</P>

<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2016-10-27 14:28:53 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>All included studies of fondaparinux for VTE prevention investigated total VTE and major bleeding as primary efficacy and safety outcomes.</P>
<P>No studies reported on fondaparinux versus other anticoagulation methods besides LMWH, warfarin, edoxaban and an intermittent pneumatic compression device (IPC), such as unfractionated heparin, aspirin, oral thrombin inhibitors and other direct factor X inhibitors; too few studies have examined fondaparinux versus LMWH, warfarin, edoxaban and IPC for VTE prevention. In addition, no study investigated long-acting pentasaccharides (idraparinux and idrabiotaparinux) and pentasaccharides other than fondaparinux for primary VTE prevention.</P>
<P>Most studies of fondaparinux have focused on prevention of VTE among patients undergoing orthopaedic surgery. Therefore, our results mainly reflect fondaparinux for VTE prevention among these patients. Subgroup analyses did not include enough studies in subgroups other than orthopaedic patients, such as the medically ill patients subgroup and the superficial venous thrombosis subgroup; hence, the evidence is insufficient to reveal whether effects and adverse effects of fondaparinux are different for patients in different clinical settings. Therefore, we are in greater need of studies that focus on fondaparinux for VTE prevention in different clinical conditions, such as gynaecological surgery, neurological surgery, etc, and other medical conditions, such as malignant disease.</P>

<P>Most of the studies included in this systematic review were high-quality RCTs with large sample sizes and reliable randomisation methods. All outcome assessments were completed by independent adjudicated committees that were blind to randomisation, and most VTEs were diagnosed by objective reliable tests (venography, independent ultrasonography, etc, for DVT; spiral computed tomography (CT), venography, etc, for PE). These points enhanced the quality of the evidence. On the other hand, some included studies were open-label or single-blinded (<LINK REF="STD-ACT2545" TYPE="STUDY">ACT2545</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-AR3106116" TYPE="STUDY">AR3106116</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-FONDACAST" TYPE="STUDY">FONDACAST</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-L_x002d_8635" TYPE="STUDY">L-8635</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Li-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Li 2015</LINK>) with risk affecting allocation (<LINK REF="REF-Hills-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hills 2009</LINK>). Most of the included studies (except <LINK REF="STD-Bern-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Bern 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cho-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Cho 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kolluri-2016" TYPE="STUDY">Kolluri 2016</LINK>; and <LINK REF="STD-Li-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Li 2015</LINK>) were organised by a pharmaceutical company, and the four studies that did not receive support from pharmaceutical companies included relatively small samples. These disadvantages could potentially introduce bias and lower the quality of the evidence.</P>
<P>Summary of findings tables show moderate-quality evidence in the fondaparinux versus placebo meta-analysis for total VTE, total DVT and proximal DVT, and high-quality evidence for symptomatic VTE and total PE. At the same time, we graded the quality of the evidence for the efficacy of fondaparinux versus LMWH as moderate or low. The quality of the evidence for major bleeding in the fondaparinux versus both placebo and LMWH analyses was moderate and high, respectively. Reasons for lowering the quality of the evidence included small numbers of events causing imprecision, and heterogeneity or inconsistency between studies. In addition, a potential risk of bias was caused by studies organised by pharmaceutical companies and by lack of publication in languages other than English, although we did not consider these sufficient to downgrade the quality of evidence. The Summary of findings table showed very low-quality evidence for fondaparinux versus both variable and 1 mg once daily fixed doses of warfarin. We included only one study comparing fondaparinux with warfarin, and events were rare, which lowered the grade of the evidence. The Summary of findings table showed low-quality evidence for fondaparinux versus mechanical thromboprophylaxis; only one included study performed this comparison, and the study was only up to eight days long, resulting in many outcomes with no reported events, as follow-up was too short. This study was organised by a pharmaceutical company. The Summary of findings table showed very low-quality evidence for fondaparinux versus edoxaban. Only one small study assessed this comparison and recorded no events, which led to lowering of the grade of evidence.</P>

<P>This systematic review had some potential biases.</P>
<P>Most included studies analysed efficacy outcomes by using the per-protocol strategy, not the intention-to-treat (ITT) strategy that was preplanned in our protocol, because most VTE and DVT events were diagnosed by venography, which is an invasive procedure that could not be used on every participant. It would be very difficult to arbitrate these participants without such efficacy evaluation results (about 10% in every study); therefore, we pooled and analysed the results presented by study reports, but not ITT data as planned. Furthermore, we included in the meta-analysis all VTE events before study time endpoints. So we pooled per-protocol data but not ITT data, as our protocol had outlined.</P>

Because adjunctive methods used by most participants in these studies consisted of graduated compression stockings (GCS), and evidence suggests that GCS would not substantially affect the symptomatic VTE rate (<LINK REF="REF-Falck_x002d_Ytter-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Falck-Ytter 2012</LINK>), we decided to include these in the meta-analysis. Another reason for including these studies was that they included large samples, and excluding them from the meta-analysis would bias the overall outcome.</P>
<P>Funnel plots for the outcome total VTE in the comparison of fondaparinux versus placebo and LMWH were asymmetrical (<LINK REF="FIG-04" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 4</LINK>; <LINK REF="FIG-05" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 5</LINK>).

Therefore, we considered risk of publication bias was possible. <LINK REF="STD-Cho-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Cho 2013</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Shen-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Shen 2014</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Yokote-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Yokote 2011</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Li-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Li 2015</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Bern-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Bern 2015</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Kolluri-2016" TYPE="STUDY">Kolluri 2016</LINK> were not conducted by pharmaceutical companies and included relatively small sample sizes. <LINK REF="STD-Yokote-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Yokote 2011</LINK> failed to report a reliable method used for randomisation; therefore, we included only this study in the sensitivity analysis. <LINK REF="STD-Shen-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Shen 2014</LINK> reported VTE rates of fondaparinux and LMWH groups instead of numbers of VTE events, and we were unable to obtain these details when communicating with study authors. Therefore, we did not include <LINK REF="STD-Shen-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Shen 2014</LINK> in the meta-analyses. We included <LINK REF="STD-Bern-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Bern 2015</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kolluri-2016" TYPE="STUDY">Kolluri 2016</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Li-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Li 2015</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Cho-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Cho 2013</LINK> in analyses of primary and secondary outcomes.</P>
<P>Finally, because we included all suitable trials on VTE prevention that included patients after orthopaedic and abdominal surgery, medically ill patients and those with superficial venous thrombosis, we noted large heterogeneity in some meta-analyses. We chose the random-effects model to analyse the data.</P>
<P>The reliability of this systematic review might be influenced by these factors, and results might need to be interpreted with caution. Although we had some limitations, we believe that our review is significant for evaluating the efficacy and safety of fondaparinux for VTE prevention.</P>

<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2016-10-27 14:28:52 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Our results show that fondaparinux was more effective in VTE prevention than both placebo and LMWH. Results were consistent with those reported by the <LINK REF="REF-Bounameaux-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bounameaux 2002</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Nijkeuter-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nijkeuter 2004</LINK> and <LINK REF="REF-Falck_x002d_Ytter-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Falck-Ytter 2012</LINK> reviews. In the Antithrombotic Therapy and Prevention of Thrombosis Guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-Falck_x002d_Ytter-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Falck-Ytter 2012</LINK>), review authors combined five large trials comparing fondaparinux 2.5 mg started six to eight hours after wound closure versus a routine prophylactic dose of LMWH for patients after surgery. Review authors showed that fondaparinux reduced the asymptomatic DVT rate significantly but did not show significant differences in symptomatic DVT and PE rates between the two types of anticoagulants. In our systematic review, we showed that fondaparinux significantly reduced total VTE and DVT rates but did not reduce symptomatic DVT and PE rates. On the other hand, our systematic review showed that fondaparinux might reduce proximal DVT by less than 50% compared with LMWH (risk ratio (RR) 0.56, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.31 to 1.0; P = 0.06), although this finding was not statistically significant. In <LINK REF="REF-Falck_x002d_Ytter-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Falck-Ytter 2012</LINK>, review authors did not study this outcome. The proximal DVT analysis result might be helpful, as proximal DVT is associated with more recurrent VTE (symptomatic and non-symptomatic) and more frequent deaths than distal DVT (<LINK REF="REF-Pinede-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pinede 2001</LINK>). We need additional data to confirm whether the result was caused by real efficacy of fondaparinux or occurred by chance. For bleeding risk, <LINK REF="REF-Falck_x002d_Ytter-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Falck-Ytter 2012</LINK> demonstrated a substantial increase in bleeding requiring reoperation associated with the use of fondaparinux (RR 1.85, 95% CI 1.1 to 3.11) compared with LMWH, but showed no difference in the non-fatal major bleeding rate (RR 1.35, 95% CI 0.89 to 2.05). In our analyses, we showed that fondaparinux increased overall major bleeding (<LINK REF="CMP-005.08" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 5.8</LINK>) but did not increase fatal bleeding. Our review used a different definition of fatal bleeding than was used in <LINK REF="REF-Falck_x002d_Ytter-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Falck-Ytter 2012</LINK>. Also, participants in our study were different from those involved in the <LINK REF="REF-Falck_x002d_Ytter-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Falck-Ytter 2012</LINK> study. We included all people requiring primary VTE prevention, but <LINK REF="REF-Falck_x002d_Ytter-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Falck-Ytter 2012</LINK> included only people who had undergone surgery. In addition, participants included in our review were potentially at lower risk of haemorrhage. Nevertheless, fondaparinux increased the overall major bleeding rate compared with LMWH. Our systematic review and the <LINK REF="REF-Falck_x002d_Ytter-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Falck-Ytter 2012</LINK> study suggest similar efficacy and safety of fondaparinux for VTE prevention in different patient populations.<BR/>
</P>
<P>Fondaparinux is the first agent in its class that was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration and the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products. Compared with LMWH for short-term VTE prevention, it is more effective and has predictable linear pharmacokinetics (<LINK REF="STD-PENTATHLON" TYPE="STUDY">PENTATHLON</LINK>). Fondaparinux is rarely neutralised by platelet factor 4 and is highly unlikely to cause thrombocytopaenia (<LINK REF="REF-Amiral-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Amiral 1997</LINK>). Fondaparinux highly selectively inhibits factor Xa with no direct effect against the thrombin molecule itself (<LINK REF="REF-Olson-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Olson 1992</LINK>). However, it causes more major bleeding, which limits its use. Therefore, we should be cautious when using fondaparinux for VTE prevention, especially in people who are at high risk of bleeding. Our results show that when fondaparinux is injected at a dose of 2.5 mg once daily, it not only reduces VTE but also increases bleeding significantly compared with the routine dose of LMWH for VTE prophylaxis. In a Cochrane systematic review (<LINK REF="REF-Brito-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brito 2011</LINK>), review authors showed that fondaparinux was non-inferior to LMWH in anticoagulative efficacy and lowered both major and minor bleeding rates compared with LMWH when used in the treatment of patients with acute coronary syndrome. In that research, the LMWH dose was approximately two times the dose used in our review, but the fondaparinux dose was the same as the one reported here. Therefore, we speculate that the higher major bleeding rate of fondaparinux might be caused by the relatively high dose used for VTE prevention. Dose-response studies (<LINK REF="STD-DRI4090" TYPE="STUDY">DRI4090</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-DRI4757" TYPE="STUDY">DRI4757</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-PENTATHLON" TYPE="STUDY">PENTATHLON</LINK>) have shown that when the fondaparinux dose is increased, bleeding risk is increased. Further research is warranted on whether the bleeding rate can be reduced by reducing the fondaparinux dose, for example, 2 mg or 1.5 mg sc once daily, without an effect on its efficacy in VTE prevention. Several recent studies on 1.5 mg once daily fondaparinux used for VTE prophylaxis for patients with renal dysfunction (<LINK REF="REF-Ageno-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ageno 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Delavenne-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Delavenne 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mismetti-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mismetti 2012</LINK>) showed that it was effective and would cause little bleeding. Pharmacokinetics studies (<LINK REF="REF-Delavenne-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Delavenne 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Delavenne-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Delavenne 2012</LINK>) have reported interindividual variability with the same dose of fondaparinux between patients with different body weight, age and creatinine clearance. Currently, only one dose of 2.5 mg fondaparinux is used for VTE prevention. Perhaps this is not suitable for all people, and the fondaparinux dose may need to be adjusted according to body surface area, body weight, age, risk of thrombosis, renal function, etc, when used for VTE prevention.</P>

<P>Evidence of moderate to high quality shows that fondaparinux is effective for short-term prevention of VTE when compared with placebo. It can reduce total VTE, DVT, total PE and symptomatic VTE and shows no reduction in deaths when compared with placebo. Evidence of low to moderate quality shows that fondaparinux is more effective for short-term prevention of VTE when compared with LMWH. It can reduce total VTE and total DVT and does not demonstrate a reduction in deaths when compared with LMWH. However, at the same time, evidence of moderate and high quality shows that fondaparinux increases major bleeding when compared with placebo and LMWH, respectively. Therefore, when fondaparinux is chosen for VTE prophylaxis, attention should be paid to the patient's bleeding and thrombosis risks. Most available data were derived from studies on patients undergoing orthopaedic surgery. Therefore, the conclusion predominantly pertains to these patients. Data on other clinical conditions such as internal medical and abdominal surgery are sparse.</P>

<P>Based on the moderate quality of evidence, we suggest that additional RCTs are needed to assess effects of fondaparinux for VTE prevention compared with placebo and LMWH, especially in terms of outcomes such as proximal DVT and PE.</P>

<P>We retrieved no RCTs on the long-acting pentasaccharides for primary VTE prevention. Therefore, RCTs are needed to assess the efficacy and safety of long-acting pentasaccharides for primary prevention of VTE.</P>
<P>As only one RCT of small sample size compared fondaparinux versus mechanical thromboprophylaxis methods, additional RCTs are needed to evaluate the efficacy of mechanical thromboprophylaxis compared with pentasaccharides.</P>
<P>No RCTs have compared pentasaccharides with other anticoagulants, such as oral direct antithrombin inhibitors and oral direct factor X inhibitors. Therefore, we need additional studies to compare these different interventions.</P>

<PRO_REV_DIFF MODIFIED="2016-10-28 08:05:06 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We note here several differences between the review and its protocol (<LINK REF="REF-Song-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Song 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>First, in the protocol, we planned to perform analyses on an intention-to-treat (ITT) basis, but we considered that this would cause serious bias. Therefore, we chose to include for analysis all venous thromboembolism (VTE) events at the studies' time endpoints. The reasons were as follows: Most participants had VTE and deep venous thrombosis (DVT) diagnosed by venography; this could not be done for every participant, and it would be very difficult to arbitrate all participants without such an efficacy evaluation result. Therefore, if we arbitrated all of the missing data (about 10% of all randomised), the result would be at high risk of bias. We used per-protocol rather than preplanned ITT data.</P>
<P>Second, Peto's method (<LINK REF="REF-Yusuf-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yusuf 1985</LINK>) can be used only to pool odds ratios. This works well when intervention effects are small (i.e. odds ratios are close to one), events are not particularly common and studies include similar numbers in experimental and control groups. For some outcomes of our systematic review, events were not rare, and it was more appropriate to use the risk ratio (RR). We used the Mantel-Haenszel RR, which can be used to analyse both rare and frequent events.</P>
<P>Third, because most major bleeding was reported as bleeding index greater than 2, not life-threatening bleeding, we added the outcome 'fatal bleeding' to clarify the true life-threatening bleeding rate.</P>
<P>Fourth, because events included in the outcome 'haemorrhagic complications' were the same as major bleeding events, and in fact, most of the included studies reported only major bleeding events, we did not analyse the 'haemorrhagic complications' outcome, as specified in our protocol.</P>
<P>Fifth, given that clinical heterogeneity was caused by different clinical settings, we performed subgroup analyses for different clinical settings; this was not prespecified in the protocol. In the protocol, we planned to perform subgroup analyses based on the half-life time of the pentasaccharides. However, as we found no RCTs investigating long-term use of pentasaccharides for VTE prevention, we studied only short-term use of the pentasaccharide fondaparinux.</P>
<P>Finally, we added to the review proximal DVT, symptomatic VTE, total pulmonary embolism (PE) and fatal bleeding as secondary outcomes; this was not mentioned in the protocol. We added these for inclusion in additional intensive analyses.</P>

Venography was considered positive if an intraluminal filling defect was seen on 2 different views, or after repeated injection of contrast medium; thrombi in the popliteal vein or above were considered proximal.

<B>Primary safety outcome: </B>major bleeding detected between first injection of study drug (dalteparin or placebo) and 2 calendar days after last injection. Major bleeding was defined as fatal bleeding; bleeding that was retroperitoneal, intracranial or intraspinal or involved any other critical organ; bleeding leading to reoperation or intervention; and a bleeding index &#8805; 2.0. The bleeding index was derived by adding the number of transfused units of packed red blood cells or whole blood to the difference in Hb level measured in grams per decilitre before and after a bleeding event. Secondary safety outcomes were death, other reported bleeding, thrombocytopenia and any other adverse events.</P>

Those with proximal DVT received anticoagulant therapy, with initial administration of unfractionated heparin along with initiation of warfarin therapy.</P>
<P>
<B>Primary safety outcome:</B> incidence of any bleeding, major or minor. This was assessed daily during the treatment period of 10 days and within 24 hours after completion or discontinuation of treatment. An episode of bleeding was classified as major if it was retroperitoneal, intracranial or intraocular, or if it was associated with death, transfusion of more than 2 units of packed red blood cells or whole blood (except autologous), a reduction in level of Hb &gt; 2 g/dL or a serious or life-threatening clinical event requiring medical intervention. Suspected intra-abdominal or intracranial bleeding was confirmed by ultrasonography, CT or MRI. Minor episodes of bleeding were defined as those with at least 1 of the following features: epistaxis lasting longer than 5 minutes or requiring intervention, ecchymosis or haematoma with maximum size of &gt; 5 cm, haematuria not associated with trauma from the urinary catheter, gastrointestinal haemorrhage not related to intubation or to passage of a nasogastric tube, wound haematoma or haemorrhagic wound complications not associated with major haemorrhage or subconjunctival haemorrhage, requiring cessation of medication.</P>
