<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2008-10-24 16:29:56 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Helen Collins">
<P>A systematic review of benzodiazepine treatment of non-alcohol related delirium discovered very few trials (one randomized, controlled study of mechanically ventilated patients, and thus poorly reflective of delirious patients as a whole; and two partially controlled studies), the results of which indicate that at this time there is no evidence to support the use of benzodiazepines in the treatment of non-alcohol withdrawal related delirium among hospitalised patients.</P>

<ABSTRACT MODIFIED="2008-09-10 14:56:03 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Helen Collins">
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Delirium occurs in 30% of hospitalised patients and is associated with prolonged hospital stay and increased morbidity and mortality. The results of uncontrolled studies have been unclear, with some suggesting that benzodiazepines may be useful in controlling non-alcohol related delirium. </P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To determine the effectiveness and incidence of adverse effects of benzodiazapines in the treatment of non-alcohol withdrawal related delirium. </P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2008-09-10 14:54:09 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Helen Collins">
<P>The trials were identified from a search of the Specialized Register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group on 26 February 2008 using the search terms: (deliri* or confusion) and (benzo* or lorazepam," or "alprazolam" or "ativan" or diazepam or valium or chlordiazepam).</P>
<P>The CDCIG Specialized Register contains records from major health databases (including MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, CENTRAL, LILACS) as well as many ongoing trial databases and grey literature sources.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2008-09-10 14:54:23 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Helen Collins">
<P>Trials had to be unconfounded, randomized and with concealed allocation of subjects. Additionally, selected trials had to have assessed patients pre- and post-treatment. Where crossover design was present, only data from the first part of the trial were to be examined.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2008-07-18 16:30:51 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Helen Collins">
<P>Two reviewers extracted data from included trials. Data were pooled where possible, and were to be analysed using appropriate statistical methods. Odd ratios or average differences were to be calculated. Only "intention to treat" data were to be included.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2008-09-10 14:55:50 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Helen Collins">
<P>Only one trial satisfying the selection criteria could be identified. In this trial, comparing the effect of the benzodiazepine, lorazepam, with dexmedetomidine, a selective alpha-2-adrenergic receptor agonist, on delirium among mechanically ventilated intensive care unit patients, dexmedetomidine treatment was associated with an increased number of delirium- and coma-free days compared with lorazepam treated patients (dexmedetomidine patients, average seven days; lorazepam patients, average three days; P = 0.01). One partially controlled study showed no advantage of a benzodiazepine (alprazolam) compared with neuroleptics in treating agitation associated with delirium, and another partially controlled study showed decreased effectiveness of a benzodiazepine (lorazepam), and increased adverse effects, compared with neuroleptics (haloperidol, chlorpromazine) for the treatment of acute confusion.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2008-09-10 14:56:03 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Helen Collins">
<P>No adequately controlled trials could be found to support the use of benzodiazepines in the treatment of non-alcohol withdrawal related delirium among hospitalised patients, and at this time benzodiazepines cannot be recommended for the control of this condition. Because of the scarcity of trials with randomization of patients, placebo control, and adequate concealment of allocation of subjects, it is clear that further research is required to determine the role of benzodiazepines in the treatment of non-alcohol withdrawal related delirium.</P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2009-08-12 10:49:19 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-09-29 04:49:10 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There are few more daunting challenges to clinicians and medical investigators than the management of delirium. Delirium, an acute confusional state described as "a transient global disorder of cognition and attention" (<LINK REF="REF-Luxenberg-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Luxenberg 1996</LINK>), occurs in up to 30% of hospitalised patients (<LINK REF="REF-Johnson-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnson 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sumner-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sumner 1994</LINK>) and has been associated with prolongation of hospital stay (<LINK REF="REF-McCusker-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">McCusker 2004</LINK>), subsequent deterioration in cognition (<LINK REF="REF-McCusker-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">McCusker 2001</LINK>), and increased morbidity and mortality (<LINK REF="REF-McCusker-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">McCusker 2002</LINK>). Although disorders drawn from the entire spectrum of non-trivial medical illnesses have contributed to delirium, those most often linked to this condition included infection, previous cognitive impairment, advanced age (i.e., 75 and older), surgery, and adverse drug effects, especially those of anticholinergics, and centrally acting medications. Evaluation of drug therapy of delirium has been difficult because of variations in the kinds of patients experiencing delirium (e.g. age, sex, medical conditions) and the heterogeneity of methods of evaluation and treatment (e.g. selection of drugs, dosages, duration of treatment). A major obstacle to the use of placebo controlled trials has been the imperative to provide care for severely agitated patients who are at danger to themselves and those around them. Further, as stated among the secondary objectives, it was important in the current study to identify drug-related adverse effects (e.g. benzodiazepine induced somnolence, agitation) that might obscure patient response to the drugs used to control delirium. The neurophysiological mechanisms of delirium are yet to be identified; evidence suggests pre-existing deficiencies in cholinergic neurotransmission as a common underlying factor (<LINK REF="REF-Tune-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tune 2002</LINK>). The presence of an apolipoprotein E4 allele has been associated with prolonged duration of delirium (Ely 2007). Benzodiazepines have been effective in treating delirium due to alcohol withdrawal (<LINK REF="REF-Mayo_x002d_Smith-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mayo-Smith 1997</LINK>), and may be useful because of the absence of adverse effects shared by alternative agents (e.g., parkinsonism with haloperidol or risperidone) for this condition, but the literature is unclear about their usefulness in delirium associated with other medical problems (<LINK REF="REF-Adams-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Adams 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Breitbart-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Breitbart 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Salzman-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Salzman 1986</LINK>), with some reports stating that benzodiazepines may contribute to the development of delirium in patients admitted to the intensive care unit (<LINK REF="REF-Dubois-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dubois 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Marcantonio-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marcantonio 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pandharipande-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pandharipande 2006</LINK>). A literature review of delirium treatment in AIDS patients, and limited to a MEDLINE search from 1966 to 1988 (<LINK REF="REF-Conn-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Conn 2001</LINK>), found only one randomized controlled trial (<LINK REF="REF-Breitbart-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Breitbart 1996</LINK>) comparing a benzodiazepine (lorazepam) with neuroleptics (haloperidol, chlorpromazine) in delirium and in this study the development of unacceptable adverse effects (severe sedation, ataxia, increased confusion) among all of the lorazepam treated patients required premature discontinuance of the benzodiazepine arm of the trial. Conn et al. concluded that neuroleptics are superior to benzodiazepines in the treatment of most cases of acute confusion. To date there has not been an inclusive systematic review of controlled studies examining the effect of benzodiazepines in the treatment of non-alcohol related delirium in hospitalised patients.</P>

<CRIT_STUDIES MODIFIED="2008-09-10 14:58:36 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Helen Collins">
<P>Types of studies included controlled, unconfounded, randomized, placebo-controlled trials with concealed allocation of subjects. Trials had to have included pre- and post-treatment assessment of delirium. Where crossover studies were reported, only data from the first part of the study were examined. Interrupted time series were excluded. Length of trial and number of measurements did not influence the selection of trials for study. Where indicated, individual patient data were requested for further examination.</P>
</CRIT_STUDIES>
<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS MODIFIED="2008-09-10 14:59:10 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Helen Collins">
<P>These included only hospitalised adults who had delirium due to causes other than benzodiazepine toxicity or withdrawal from alcohol. Potentially correctable causes of delirium had to have been ruled out (e.g., drug-induced, pain, hypoxia) and the diagnosis of delirium had to have been made using DSM IV or DSM III criteria, or other accepted standards for diagnosing delirium. Where delirium occurred, or persisted, despite the control of an alleged cause, this was included in the present review.</P>
</CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS MODIFIED="2008-09-10 14:59:35 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Helen Collins">
<P>Intervention included treatment with benzodiazepines, of any dosage, compared with placebo or another drug. Patients who received more than one psychopharmacologic agent on a long-term basis were excluded from the study. Because delirium may have responded quickly to therapy, no minimal period of treatment was mandated but due to the fluctuating nature of delirium the response to treatment must have persisted for at least three days for the study to be included. It is acknowledged that the figure of three days was arbitrary, but the literature has been silent on the subject of spontaneous remissions and relapses of delirium, and this criterion was based on clinical experience.</P>

<STUDY_DESCRIPTION MODIFIED="2008-09-10 15:06:26 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Helen Collins">
<P>Only one study was identified (<LINK REF="STD-Pandharipande-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Pandharipande 2007</LINK>) that satisfied the selection criteria. This study compared the effectiveness of the short acting benzodiazepine, lorazepam, with that of the selective alpha-2 adrenergic agonist, dexmedetomidine, on duration of coma-free days, duration of delirium-free days, and duration of coma- and delirium-free days while providing adequate sedation in mechanically ventilated patients in the intensive care unit. The study had no placebo control group.</P>
<P>Patient population: 106 mechanically ventilated medial and surgical intensive care unit patients. Dexmedotomidine was used in 52 patients; lorazepam in 51. The average age in the dexmedetomidine group was 60 (49 to 65) and in the lorazepam group, 49 (45 to 57). There were 30 (58%) men in the dexmedetomidine group and 23 (45%) in the lorazepam group (P = 0.20).</P>
<P>No significant difference between the two groups could be identified in terms of (1) severity of illness measured by the Apache ii scores (P = 0.75); (2) duration of time on mechanical ventilation prior to enrolment (P = 0.18); (3) level of sedation measured by the Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale, RASS (<LINK REF="REF-Ely-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ely 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sessler-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sessler 2002</LINK>) (P = 0.21); (4) admission diagnoses: sepsis/acute respiratory distress/ syndrome (P = 0.78); (5) intensive care unit type, medical/surgical (P = 0.97); (6) or degree of sedation on admission to study (P = 0.21).</P>
<P>Delirium was identified using the Confusion Assessment Method of the Intensive Care Unit, CAM-ICU (<LINK REF="REF-Ely-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ely 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lin-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lin 2004</LINK>). The assessment for delirium was positive if patients showed: acute onset of mental changes or fluctuating mental status plus inattention and either disorganized thinking or altered level of consciousness. The RASS scale measures level of consciousness based on patients' ability to respond to verbal or physical stimuli, with coma defined as a score of minus 4 (responsive only to physical stimuli) or minus 5 (unresponsive to physical stimuli).</P>
<P>Patients were identified as delirious if they had a positive Confusion Assessment Method score for the ICU, CAM-ICU (<LINK REF="REF-Ely-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ely 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lin-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lin 2004</LINK>) and were responsive to verbal stimulation (RASS score of -3 or more positive). Coma was defined as a RASS score of -4 to - 5).</P>
<P>All results were subjected to intention-to-treat analysis. Pearson chi square tests compared categorical variables between the two groups and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests compared continuous variables, including delirium-free and coma-free days. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were used to graph time to event analysis.</P>
<P>Two partially controlled studies (<LINK REF="STD-Breitbart-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Breitbart 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Christensen-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Christensen 1998</LINK>) that examined benzodiazepine treatment of non-alcohol related delirium were identified. These studies were excluded from meta-analysis because of, in one case, premature termination of the trial, and in the other, unclear separation of delirium from other clinical conditions.</P>

<P>The study satisfied the selection criteria listed above.</P>
</STUDY_QUALITY>
<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS MODIFIED="2008-09-10 15:08:32 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Helen Collins">
<P>The average delirium-free duration for lorazepam treated patients was seven days (5 to 10) and for dexmedetomidine was 10 days (9 to 12), P = 0.09. The average coma-free period for lorazepam treated patients was eight days (5 to 10) and for dexmedetomidine patients was nine days (9 to 12) (P &lt; 0.001). The average duration of delirium-free plus coma-free days was three days (1 to 6) for lorazepam patients and seven days (1 to 10) for dexmedetommidine patients (P = 0.01). Prevalence of delirium while on treatment was 82% or lorazepam patients and 79% for dexmedetomidine patients (P = 0.65). Prevalence of coma was 92% for lorazepam patients and 63% for dexmedetomidine patients (P &lt; 0.001). Prevalence of delirium or coma was 98% for lorazepam patients and 87% for dexmedetomidine patients (P = 0.003). Adequate sedation, as measured by RASS score within one point of physician goal, was achieved in 67% of dexmedetomidine patients and 55% of lorazepam patients (P = 0.008). The 28 day mortality (27%) of lorazepam treated patients was not significantly different from that of the dexmedetomidine patients (17%) (P = 0.18). Because only one study that satisfied selection criteria was found, neither meta-analysis of the results or testing of the secondary objectives of the current systematic analysis could be performed.<BR/>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2009-08-12 10:49:19 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The results of <LINK REF="STD-Pandharipande-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Pandharipande 2007</LINK> supported the efficacy of dexmedetomidine in minimising delirium when used for sedation in mechanically ventilated patients compared with lorazepam. Dexmedetomidine treated patients had more coma-free or delirium-free days than lorazepam patients (P = 0.01), suggesting better control of acute confusion and decreased levels of sedation in contrast to lorazepam treated patients. The absence of placebo controls in this report did not permit any comment on the effect of lorazepam in the management of delirium compared with no drug treatment at all. The use of a highly selected group of patients - those on mechanical ventilation - prevents application of the results of the study to the population of delirious patients as a whole. It should be noted that this was not a study of treatment of delirium, but rather a comparison of two agents for sedation during prolonged mechanical ventilation, a situation where the incidence of delirium is very high.</P>
<P>An interrupted RCT of <LINK REF="STD-Breitbart-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Breitbart 1996</LINK> showed no improvement in delirium among patients briefly treated with a benzodiazepine (Iorazepam) compared with improvement in delirium for patients receiving neuroleptics (haloperidol, chlorpromazine) (P &lt; 0.001), based on Delirium Rating Scores. In this study the benzodiazepine arm of the trial was discontinued prematurely because of unacceptable adverse effects among the lorazepam treated patients. The greater duration of coma among lorazepam treated patients in <LINK REF="STD-Pandharipande-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Pandharipande 2007</LINK> corroborates the results of the interrupted trial (<LINK REF="STD-Breitbart-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Breitbart 1996</LINK>) in which all delirious patients treated with lorazepam developed unacceptable adverse effects, including severe sedation. A second partially controlled study (<LINK REF="STD-Christensen-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Christensen 1998</LINK>) compared the effect of a benzodiazepine (alprazolam) with a neuroleptic (haloperidol) effect on behavioural manifestations due to delirium, as well as other conditions (dementia, amnesic disorders) among institutionalised patients, and found no significant difference in the outcome behavioural scales comparing benzodiazepine and neuroleptic patients. It is not enough to accept these results as simply showing no clear advantage in the use of the benzodiazepine, lorazepam, in controlling delirium, compared with other drugs. The findings of Pandharipande and of Brietbart that increased sedation and prolonged coma in lorazepam treated patients suggest that such treatment may worsen the status of delirious patients, and clinicians should be guided accordingly.</P>

<P>Medial and surgical ICU patients requiring mechanical ventilation for more than 24 hours. 106 patients 54 patients (average age, 59, 23 men) in control group. 52 patients (average age 60; 30 men) received study drug. Delirium diagnosed using IC-CAM method or RASS scale</P>

<CHAR_INTERVENTIONS MODIFIED="2008-09-29 04:51:41 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Patients were treated for up to 120 hrs, with: control group receiving intravenous lorazepam; study group receiving intravenous dexmedetomidine). Drug infusion rate was titrated to reach a sedation level determined by the Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale. Rescue intervention for acute agitation while on treatment included propofol infusion; for increased pain, fentanyl was given</P>
</CHAR_INTERVENTIONS>
<CHAR_OUTCOMES MODIFIED="2008-09-10 15:12:59 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Helen Collins">
<P>Prevalence of coma was significantly higher among lorazepam patients compared with dexmedetomidine patients (92% vs 63%; P &lt; 0.001). Delirium-free days were not significantly different comparing the two groups (L pts av 7 d, D pts av 9 d, P = 0.09); delirium-free and coma free days were significantly greater for D patients compared with L patients (Dpts av 7 d, Lpts av 3 d; P = 0.01)</P>
</CHAR_OUTCOMES>
<CHAR_NOTES MODIFIED="2008-09-29 04:52:49 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Authors note that dexmedetomidine has analgesic properties, but that this group received more fentanyl than lorazepam patients, introducing two uncontrolled variables (pain control and sedation effect of fentanyl) that may have affected the outcomes. Authors (Prandharipande 2008) noted that the long half-life of lopazepam (8-15 hours) compared to dexmedetomidine (2 hours) could contibute to the differences in oversedation favoring the shorter acting drug.</P>

<P>Prospective randomized trial comparing the effect on delirium of lorazepam (6 patients), chlopromazine (13 patients) and haloperidol (11 patients) in hospitalised AIDS patients. Treatment with either haloperidol or chlorpromazine improved delirium in these patients compared with no effect of lorazepam (P &lt;0.01). Because of unacceptable adverse effects (oversedation, ataxia, worsening confusion) the lorazepam arm of the study was terminated prematurely.</P>

<P>Randomized double-blind study comparing effect of alprazolam and low-dose haloperidol on disruptive behaviour associated with delirium, dementia, and amnesic and other cognitive disorders. 48 older, cognitively impaired nursing home patients. No significant differences in outcome scales (Clinical Global Impression; Blessed Dementia Scale; Sandoz Clinical Assessment Scale) comparing alprazolam with haloperidol treated patients. There was not adequate concealment of allocation of patients and there was no clear separation of patients with acute confusion from other conditions having cognitive impairment.</P>
