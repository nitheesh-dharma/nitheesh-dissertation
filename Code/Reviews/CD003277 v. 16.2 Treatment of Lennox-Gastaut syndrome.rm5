<P>The optimum treatment for Lennox-Gastaut syndrome has yet to be established. Lennox-Gastaut syndrome is a seizure (epilepsy) disorder that is commonly associated with behavioural and mental health problems. Many different treatments are currently used in the treatment of this disorder and many more have been tried in the past, often with little success. The review of trials found that there was no evidence to suggest that any one drug was more effective than another in the treatment of this disorder in terms of controlling the different seizure types. More research is needed to compare the therapies currently available.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2012-12-14 14:23:16 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) is an age-specific disorder, characterised by epileptic seizures, a characteristic electroencephalogram (EEG), psychomotor delay and behavioural disorder. It occurs more frequently in males and onset is usually before the age of eight years, with a peak between three and five years of age. Late cases occurring in adolescence and early adulthood have rarely been reported. Language is frequently affected, with both slowness in ideation and expression in addition to difficulties of motor dysfunction. Severe behavioural disorders (e.g. hyperactivity, aggressiveness and autistic tendencies) and personality disorders are nearly always present. There is also a tendency for psychosis to develop with time. The long-term prognosis is poor; although the epilepsy often improves, complete seizure freedom is rare and conversely the mental and psychiatric disorders tend to worsen with time.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2012-12-14 14:23:16 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>To compare the effects of pharmaceutical therapies used to treat LGS in terms of control of seizures and adverse effects. Many people who suffer from this syndrome will already be receiving other antiepileptic medications at the time of their entry into a trial. However, for the purpose of this review we will only consider the effect of the single therapeutic agent being trialled (often as add-on therapy).</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2013-01-15 15:10:58 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Epilepsy Group's Specialized Register (18 October 2012), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, <I>The Cochrane Library </I>Issue 10 of 12, 2012) and MEDLINE (1946 to October week 2, 2012). We also searched EMBASE (1980 to March 2003). We imposed no language restrictions. We searched the International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial Number (ISRCTN) register (18 October 2012) for ongoing trials and in addition, we contacted pharmaceutical companies and colleagues in the field to seek any unpublished or ongoing studies.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2012-12-14 14:23:16 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson">
<P>All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of the administration of drug therapy to patients with LGS.</P>

<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2009-05-12 15:36:32 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two review authors independently extracted data. Analysis included assessing study quality, as well as statistical analysis of the effects on overall seizure rates and effects on specific seizure types (e.g. drop attacks), adverse effects and mortality.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2011-05-08 14:52:36 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We found nine RCTs, but were unable to perform any meta-analysis, because each trial looked at different populations, different therapies and considered different outcomes.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2012-12-14 14:23:16 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The optimum treatment for LGS remains uncertain and no study to date has shown any one drug to be highly efficacious; rufinamide, lamotrigine, topiramate and felbamate may be helpful as add-on therapy, clobazam may be helpful for drop seizures. Until further research has been undertaken, clinicians will need to continue to consider each patient individually, taking into account the potential benefit of each therapy weighed against the risk of adverse effects.</P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2013-01-15 16:03:05 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2013-01-15 15:17:40 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) is an age-specific epileptic encephalopathy, characterised by epileptic seizures, slow spike-waves in the waking electroencephalogram (EEG) and fast rhythmic bursts during sleep, psychomotor delay and personality disorders (<LINK REF="REF-Beaumanoir-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beaumanoir 2005</LINK>). The incidence is not known but it has been estimated to account for 1% to 10% of all childhood epilepsies. It occurs more frequently in males, and onset is usually before the age of eight years, with a peak between three and five years of age. Late cases occurring in adolescence and early adulthood have rarely been reported. About one-fifth of cases are preceded by West's syndrome (a triad of infantile spasms, hypsarrhythmia and psychomotor delay).</P>
<P>The LGS is an age-dependent electroclinical diagnosis for which there may be multiple aetiologies, whether genetic, structural, metabolic or unknown (<LINK REF="REF-Berg-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Berg 2011</LINK>). Approximately one-quarter have no prior history of epilepsy, neurological abnormality or developmental delay prior to the onset. Others have identical electrical and clinical features associated with such aetiologies as tuberous sclerosis and cortical dysplasia.</P>
<P>More recently a consensus approach reviewing the issues surrounding the diagnosis and treatment options for LGS has been published. This review also highlighted the limitations and difficulties of trials that have studied this syndrome to date, has proposed key considerations for future trials and the need for a comprehensive approach for the treatment of this syndrome (<LINK REF="REF-Arzimanoglou-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Arzimanoglou 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>The following seizure types and EEG findings are associated with LGS (<LINK REF="REF-Beaumanoir-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beaumanoir 2005</LINK>).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">1. Tonic axial seizures</HEADING>
<P>These are the hallmark seizure type, and may be axial, appendicular or global, symmetrical, or unilateral. They consist of flexion of the neck and body, extension of the arms and legs, and contraction of the facial muscles. There may be associated apnoea, eye rolling and facial flushing. Consciousness is usually impaired. They are diurnal and nocturnal. They are usually brief, lasting seconds. The EEG shows discharges of fast bilateral bursts, particularly seen during sleep, predominately anteriorly or on the vertex.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">2. Atypical absence seizures</HEADING>
<P>These occur in the majority of cases and are frequently subtle. Loss of consciousness may be incomplete, allowing the individual to continue ongoing activities. However they are often accompanied by loss of muscle tone, myoclonic jerks and drooling (<LINK REF="REF-Aicardi-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aicardi 1996</LINK>). EEG shows irregular diffuse slow spike-wave activity at 2 to 2.5 Hz.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">3. Atonic seizures</HEADING>
<P>These are less frequent than the tonic axial seizures. They are manifested by a rapid loss of tone that may involve a sudden head drop or fall to the ground and are associated with polyspikes and slow waves, or diffuse spike waves on the EEG (<LINK REF="REF-Beaumanoir-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beaumanoir 2005</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">4. Myoclonic seizures</HEADING>
<P>These are considered rare and in children with prominent myoclonic jerks alternative diagnoses such as myoclonic astatic epilepsy or Dravet's syndrome should be considered. Rarely they may precede atonic attacks as myoclonic-atonic attacks. They can be associated with slow waves, polyspike waves, diffuse rapid spike waves or brief discharges predominantly in the anterior regions.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">5. Tonic-clonic and partial-onset seizures</HEADING>
<P>These are less commonly seen in LGS than other epilepsies, but may nonetheless be present in a minority of cases.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">6. Status epilepticus and non-convulsive status</HEADING>
<P>Occurs in approximately two-thirds of patients and usually consists of continuous absence seizures punctuated by recurring tonic seizures; may be difficult to recognise.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">EEG</HEADING>
<P>This is abnormal in the vast majority of cases showing 2- to 2.5-Hz slow spike-wave discharges over both hemispheres with multifocal spikes and spike waves predominating in the frontal and temporal areas. In addition, the presence of fast (10 Hz) rhythms associated with tonic attacks or sometimes with minimal or no clinical manifestations, mainly during non-REM sleep, is considered a necessary criteria by some authors. However, in some people the characteristic EEG abnormalities may be variable and even transient.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Prognosis</HEADING>
<P>Psychomotor delay and neuropsychiatric symptoms occur in 90% of people with LGS. Some children have delayed development prior to the onset of their seizures as part of a predisposing condition, for example West's syndrome. Nevertheless even in these individuals further regression of development is often seen after the onset of LGS. Language is frequently affected, with both slowness in ideation and expression in addition to difficulties of motor dysfunction. Severe behavioural disorders are nearly always present. There is also a tendency for psychosis to develop with time. The long-term prognosis is poor; although the epilepsy often improves, complete seizure freedom is rare and conversely the mental and psychiatric disorders tend to worsen with time (<LINK REF="REF-Beaumanoir-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beaumanoir 2005</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Treatment</HEADING>
<P>Treatment is generally unsatisfactory and few randomised controlled trials (RCTs) have been undertaken. Treatment of the multiple seizure types often results in polypharmacy and poor seizure control with frequent episodes of status. Occasionally surgery (corpus callosotomy or insertion of a vagal nerve stimulator for intractable drop attacks (<LINK REF="REF-Patwardhan-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Patwardhan 2000</LINK>) or resection of an underlying localised lesion) may be beneficial (<LINK REF="REF-Beaumanoir-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beaumanoir 2005</LINK>). A ketogenic diet may also be considered in these patients. Psychotherapy and psychiatric interventions may be helpful in treating the psychiatric disorders.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2012-12-14 14:23:16 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The aim is to compare the effects of single pharmaceutical therapies (either as first- or second-line adjunctive therapy) used to treat LGS in terms of control of seizures and adverse effects.

We excluded one study (<LINK REF="STD-Vajda-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Vajda 1985</LINK>) because only some of the participants had a diagnosis of LGS and the results were not given independently for those participants. Two further studies remain under review. <LINK REF="STD-Jensen-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Jensen 1994</LINK> appears to include the same cohort of participants as <LINK REF="STD-Anonymous-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Anonymous 1993</LINK>; we are contacting the authors in order to confirm or refute this possibility. <LINK REF="STD-Vassella-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Vassella 1978</LINK>: this paper is written in German and the results remain unclear after translation; again we hope to contact the authors in order to clarify the results. <LINK REF="STD-Glauser-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Glauser 2009</LINK> included the same cohort of patients as <LINK REF="STD-Glauser-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Glauser 2008</LINK> but with different long-term follow-up results.

<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Anonymous-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Anonymous 1989</LINK> was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled multicentre trial of 73 participants. Inclusion criteria included participants aged between two and 18 years of age: they must have had seizures for at least six months. All participants had a history of multiple seizure types with seizure onset during the first decade and had at least 40 clinically recognisable seizures every two weeks during the six weeks before study entry. Predominately generalised, slow, spike and wave discharges were demonstrated on an EEG during the three months before study entry. No individual was receiving more than three marketed antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) and none had previous exposure to cinromide. The trial consisted of a six-week baseline period, following which participants were randomised to receive either cinromide or placebo for a period of 18 weeks. Study medication was initiated at 20 to 40 mg/kg/day, divided into four equal doses. Further increases (to a total daily maximum of 83 to 109 mg/kg) were prescribed at weekly visits, if each prior dose was tolerated and seizures continued. The method of randomisation is not stated. Both the recipients and assessors were blinded. There was loss to follow-up and data were only analysed for 56 of the participants. Outcomes reported were complete cessation and a reduction in all seizure types.</P>

Individuals were included if they had a history of multiple types of seizures and a minimum of 90 atonic seizures or atypical absence seizures per month during an eight-week pre-study phase and were taking no more than two AEDs. The trial consisted of a 28-day baseline period followed by a 14-day titration phase and a 56-day maintenance period. The initial dose of felbamate was 15 mg/kg/day, increased to 30 mg/kg after seven days and to either 14 mg/kg/day or 3600 mg/day (whichever was lower) after 14 days. The number of capsules taken by participants in the placebo group was based on body weight. Randomisation was by a computer-generated schedule. Both recipients and assessors were blinded. Two participants withdrew from the study because of unacceptable adverse effects; there was no loss to follow-up. Outcomes reported were cessation and/or reduction of atonic, tonic-clonic and all seizures types.</P>

<P>All but one of the nine studies were double-blind placebo-controlled trials, but only two gave the method of randomisation, of which only one stated that concealment of allocation had been performed. Eight had loss of participants to follow-up. The ninth study was an open dose-finding study that did not state the method of randomisation and had loss of patients to follow-up (see <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>).</P>
<P>We had planned to look at characteristics of the population that may affect outcome regardless of treatment (see <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>); unfortunately not only was there great heterogeneity among the populations studied, but the information was not always presented. The male:female ratio given for six studies was 1.5:1.0 and the age at trial entry given for eight studies ranged from two to 60 years of age. The age at diagnosis of LGS was not given for any of the studies other than one study that stated age of onset was before 11 years of age. It is not possible, therefore, to comment on any effect that these characteristics might have had on final outcome.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2012-12-14 14:23:16 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>LGS is a complex epileptic encephalopathy that encompasses different seizure types that often vary in their frequency over a period of time. It is a syndrome that has historically been difficult to treat, with many people receiving polypharmacy without seizure control. The aim of our review was to try and determine the evidence base for the optimal treatment of this syndrome (on a single therapy basis, though it must be remembered that many individuals will have been receiving polytherapy at the time of entry into a trial). This has not been possible from current data available for the reasons discussed below.</P>
<P>LGS is not rare; it is thought to account for up to 10% of all childhood epilepsies, yet despite an extensive review of the literature we found only nine RCTs looking at the pharmaceutical treatment of this syndrome. There are several possible explanations for this lack of information. LGS is primarily a syndrome of childhood; although long-term prognosis is poor with regard to cognitive outcome, seizures become less troublesome into adulthood. Treatments require evaluation early in its course. There has traditionally been reluctance to set up trials in the paediatric age group as it is both difficult and expensive, and continues to be so, despite the early exclusivity clause set out by EU Regulations (<LINK REF="REF-European-Union-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">European Union 2006</LINK>). In addition, although LGS is not rare, its prevalence would require a multicentre collaboration to enrol the numbers of individuals required for sufficient power. This would require agreement on selection of individuals, drug therapy and outcome measures (<LINK REF="REF-Arzimanoglou-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Arzimanoglou 2009</LINK>). LGS is usually diagnosed after a period of time and by definition the individual must suffer from several different seizure types with specific EEG changes, so that by the time the diagnosis is certain many individuals will have already received several AEDs. Assessment of the efficacy of any add-on or single therapy is then difficult. The natural history of the syndrome shows that the frequency and type of seizures often fluctuate with time so that improvement/deterioration seen might not be due to the drug therapy being studied. Perhaps it is not surprising that no monotherapy (to date) has been shown to be highly effective in this syndrome.</P>
<P>Although we did find nine RCTs, we were unable to perform any sort of useful meta-analysis, primarily because all but two trials studied a different therapy. However, even in the two trials that had considered the same therapy, overall numbers were small and the methodology of the two studies differed significantly, making it difficult to combine the results. We could have assumed that the participants enrolled in the seven studies were all from the same population (i.e. did all suffer LGS), but it was clear that the studies had used different entry criteria and definitions (summarised under <LINK TAG="STUDY_DESCRIPTION" TYPE="SECTION">Description of studies</LINK>) leading to heterogeneity between the groups. In addition, the studies all used different outcome measures; for example <LINK REF="STD-Anonymous-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Anonymous 1989</LINK> only considered cessation or reduction of all seizure types, while <LINK REF="STD-Inanaga-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Inanaga 1989</LINK> considered a reduction in the number of absence, tonic and atonic seizures and <LINK REF="STD-Motte-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Motte 1997</LINK> reported a reduction in drop attacks, tonic-clonic seizures and all seizure types. Even when studies did report the same outcomes, the results were often presented in different ways; for example <LINK REF="STD-Anonymous-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Anonymous 1989</LINK> gave the reduction in all seizure types as the percentage reduction in number of seizures for each participant, while <LINK REF="STD-Sachdeo-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Sachdeo 1999</LINK> gave an overall reduction for all the participants combined.</P>
<P>Finally, and it might be argued most importantly, no trials have been undertaken to examine the effects of treatment on behaviour or cognitive outcome, even though these are frequently cited by the families as being the most difficult features of the syndrome to accept and manage.</P>

<P>The optimum treatment for LGS remains uncertain and no study to date has shown any one drug to be highly efficacious; lamotrigine, rufinamide, topiramate and felbamate may be helpful as add-on therapy. Until further research has been undertaken, clinicians will need to continue to consider each patient individually, taking into account the potential benefit of each therapy weighed against the risk of adverse effects.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2012-12-14 14:23:16 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Technical limitations, logistical challenges and ethical constraints should not provide excuses for not conducting well-designed drug trials in children. It is clear that consideration should be given to trial of new medications early in the development of new medications, particularly if they show broad-spectrum efficacy. It is recommended that the key considerations proposed by the consensus group (<LINK REF="REF-Arzimanoglou-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Arzimanoglou 2009</LINK>) are borne in mind by future researchers.</P>
