<P>Intrauterine insemination (IUI) is an assisted reproduction procedure that places sperm directly into the uterus. Additionally, medication (hormones) are given to hyper stimulate the ovaries, which results most of the time in the release of more eggs which can be fertilized and this in turn, results in higher pregnancy rates, but also in a higher number of multiple pregnancies.<BR/>Forty three trials involving 3957 women were included. The review compared different drugs for ovarian hyperstimulation showing that injections result in higher pregnancy rates compared with oral medication. However, the evidence for this result is not very strong. Furthermore, it showed that if stimulation is used it might be done with low dose injections, since multiple pregnancy rates were increased with high dose injections, without resulting in more pregnancies. This review does not show which injection should be used, since there is no convincing evidence of a difference. Finally, this review does not answer the question whether the addition of GnRH agonist or antagonist is useful.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Intrauterine insemination (IUI) combined with ovarian hyperstimulation (OH) has been demonstrated to be an effective form of treatment for subfertile couples. Several ovarian stimulation protocols combined with IUI have been proposed, but it is still not clear which stimulation protocol and which dose is the most (cost-)effective. </P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To evaluate ovarian stimulation protocols for intrauterine insemination for all indications.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>We searched for all publications which described randomised controlled trials comparing different ovarian stimulation protocols followed by IUI . We searched the Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group's Central register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) . We searched the electronic databases of MEDLINE (January 1966 to present) and EMBASE (1980 to present).</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomised controlled trials only were considered for inclusion in this review. Trials comparing different ovarian stimulation protocols combined with IUI were selected and reviewed in detail.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2010-11-11 20:45:27 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Forty three trials involving 3957 women were included. There were 11 comparisons in this review. Pregnancy rates are reported here since results of live birth rates were lacking.<BR/>Seven studies (n = 556) were pooled comparing gonadotrophins with anti-oestrogens showing significant higher pregnancy rates with gonadotrophins (OR 1.8, 95% CI 1.2 to 2.7). Five studies (n = 313) compared anti-oestrogens with aromatase inhibitors reporting no significant difference (OR 1.2 95% CI 0.64 to 2.1). The same could be concluded comparing different types of gonadotrophins (9 studies included, n = 576). Four studies (n = 415) reported that gonadotrophins alone are more effective than with the addition of a GnRH agonist (OR 1.8 95% CI 1.1 to 3.0). Data of three studies (n = 299) showed no convincing evidence of adding a GnRH antagonist to gonadotrophins (OR 1.5 95% CI 0.83 to 2.8). The results of two studies (n = 297) reported no evidence of benefit in doubling the dose of gonadotrophins (OR 1.2 95% 0.67 to 1.9) although the multiple pregnancy rates and OHSS rates were increased. For the remaining five comparisons only one or none studies were included.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>Robust evidence is lacking but based on the available results gonadotrophins might be the most effective drugs when IUI is combined with ovarian hyperstimulation. When gonadotrophins are applied it might be done on a daily basis. When gonadotrophins are used for ovarian stimulation low dose protocols are advised since pregnancy rates do not differ from pregnancy rates which result from high dose regimen, whereas the chances to encounter negative effects from ovarian stimulation such as multiples and OHSS are limited with low dose gonadotrophins. Further research is needed for each comparison made.</P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2011-05-12 15:23:43 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2011-05-12 15:18:46 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Worldwide, intrauterine insemination (IUI), is one of the most frequently used fertility treatments for couples with unexplained or male subfertility (<LINK REF="REF-Cohlen-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cohlen 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Goverde-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goverde 2000</LINK>). A systematic review of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing IUI with timed intercourse reported a three fold increase in the probability of conception with IUI for couples with persistent infertility (<LINK REF="REF-Hughes-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hughes 1997</LINK>). IUI is often combined with ovarian hyperstimulation (OH) to increase the number of available oocytes and therefore, to further enhance the probability of conception. The use of OH may also correct subtle cycle disorders and allows for optimal timing of the insemination. The use of gonadotrophins to achieve OH for IUI cycles has been shown to be an effective treatment modality for couples with unexplained subfertility compared with IUI in natural cycles (OR 2.4, 95% CI 1.4 to 3.9) (<LINK REF="REF-Hughes-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hughes 1997</LINK>). A more recent systematic review suggests that ovarian stimulation and IUI is more likely to result in a live birth than IUI in natural cycles (OR 2.0, 95% CI 2.0 to 3.5) (<LINK REF="REF-Verhulst-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Verhulst 2006</LINK>). For severe male subfertility (total motile sperm count &lt; 10 million) IUI is more effective compared with timed intercourse, although the benefit of additional ovarian stimulation in these couples has not been proven. On the other hand, OH does seem to improve pregnancy rates in couples with a mild semen defect (total motile sperm count &gt; 10 million) (<LINK REF="REF-Cohlen-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cohlen 1997</LINK>). Mild endometriosis in women with no other cause of infertility is often considered to be comparable to unexplained infertility and in these couples stimulated IUI has been recommended although it is uncertain whether or not un stimulated IUI may also be beneficial (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-Guidelines-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE Guidelines 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>However, OH is associated with an increased risk of multiple pregnancies, which in turn increases maternal risks, preterm delivery and perinatal morbidity and mortality. Increasingly, trialists are being encouraged to report BESST (Birth Emphasizing a Successful Singleton at Term) as the primary outcome (<LINK REF="REF-Min-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Min 2004</LINK>). Bearing this in mind, it is important that protocols for IUI in combination with OH seek to keep multiple pregnancies to a minimum (<LINK REF="REF-Cohlen-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cohlen 2005</LINK>). Another major adverse event with gonadotrophins is the probability of achieving ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) (<LINK REF="REF-Derman-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Derman 1994</LINK>). Adverse effects to consider with oral ovarian stimulation protocols are: hot flushes, visual disturbances, anti-oestrogenic effects on the endometrium and cervical mucus.</P>
<P>The benefits of oral ovarian stimulation agents are their convenience and their low cost, although it has been suggested that they are less effective for IUI (<LINK REF="REF-Hughes-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hughes 1997</LINK>;s <LINK REF="REF-Cohlen-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cohlen 1997</LINK>). Several RCTs have been published that compared oral versus injection agents, but most of them lack sufficient power to draw firm conclusions (<LINK REF="REF-Athaullah-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Athaullah 2002</LINK>). Recently, a new oral drug has been added to the armamentarium of ovarian stimulating drugs: aromatase-inhibitors. Gonadotrophin releasing hormone analogues (GnRH-analogue) have also been used in protocols for ovarian stimulation. More recently, gonadotrophin releasing hormone antagonists (GnRH antagonist) have been proposed in IUI programs as an alternative to GnRH agonists (<LINK REF="STD-Ragni-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Ragni 2004</LINK>).<BR/>Finally, various dosages of ovarian stimulation agents are being used in order to optimise pregnancy rates, while reducing the number of multiple pregnancies. For example, 150 IU of follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) was associated with a multiple pregnancy rate of 27% (<LINK REF="REF-Guzick-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guzick 1999</LINK>), whereas other studies that used a lower dose of FSH (50-75 IU) reported singleton pregnancies only (<LINK REF="STD-Balasch-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Balasch 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ragni-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Ragni 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>In conclusion, the optimal ovarian stimulation protocol should maximise the probability of conception (ideally expressed as singleton live birth at term) and in the mean time minimise the risk of multiple pregnancies and the occurrence of OHSS.</P>

<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>Couples who have been trying to conceive for at least one year and for whom OH combined with IUI is a treatment option, including:<BR/>- Unexplained subfertility which was defined as a subfertility of at least one year duration without any abnormality found at routine fertility investigation (consisting of the following: ovulatory status confirmed with biphasic basal body temperature chart (BBTC), luteal progesterone (P) or sonographic evidence of ovulation; tubal patency confirmed; normal semen parameters as defined by the WHO).<BR/>- Male factor subfertility was defined as semen quality not meeting the criteria for normality as defined by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 1987 (thus at least): sperm concentration &lt; 20 x 106/ml or total motility &lt; 50% or normal morphology &lt; 50%, &lt; 14% normal morphology was considered as abnormal when Kruger criteria were used (Kruger 1993). In 1992 the WHO changed its criteria for sperm morphology from 50% to 30% (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1992</LINK>). <BR/>- Mild endometriosis was diagnosed by laparoscopy.<BR/>- Other types of subfertility which were treated with OH combined with IUI. <BR/> </P>

<P>Two review authors (AEPC,MJH) independently selected the trials included according to the aforementioned criteria. Disagreements were resolved through arbitration by BJ Cohlen. Analysis of agreement between the two observers for inclusion was performed using crude percentage agreement. This analysis was performed on the method of randomisation, concealment of allocation, study design and primary outcomes. Type of study, quality of the selected studies, type of participants, type of interventions and type of outcome measures mentioned at the 'criteria for considering studies' section were extracted and assessed by these same two observers as were the data. If specific information was missing, we contacted one of the trial authors by letter, email or fax.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality assessment</B>
<BR/>We extracted the following characteristics from each trial to assess the quality of included studies.<BR/>- Method of randomisation; adequately randomised, quasi- randomised or not clear.<BR/>Quasi-randomised: e.g. trials using alternating record numbers, dates of birth or odds and even numbers will not be included. Studies where the method of randomisation is not clear: e.g. not stated or stated without further description will be included in the review.<BR/>- Concealment of allocation; adequate, inadequate or not clear.<BR/>Adequate allocation: e.g. by third party or sealed opaque envelopes. Inadequate allocation: e.g. open list of random numbers or open envelopes/ tables. Not clear: e.g. not stated or stated without further description.<BR/>- Trial design; parallel design, cross-over design or not clear.<BR/>Parallel designed studies or first data of cross-over studies will be included.<BR/>- Power calculation; power calculation beforehand, no power calculation or not clear.<BR/>- Drop-outs; details and number of dropouts (couples) or no details on dropouts.<BR/>- Cancelled cycles: reason for and number of cancelled cycles given or no details on cancelled cycles given.<BR/>- Blinding; when possible and appropriate blinding will be assessed.<BR/>- Intention to treat analysis: performed, not performed or not clear.<BR/>
<B>
<BR/>Data extraction</B>
<BR/>We extracted the following characteristics of the participants from each trial to define the type of participants in detail and to detect possible clinical heterogeneity:<BR/>- Age of the woman;<BR/>- Duration of subfertility;<BR/>- Type of subfertility;<BR/>- Previous fertility treatments;<BR/>- Primary or secondary subfertility.</P>
<P>We extracted interventions which might have influenced treatment outcome were extracted from each study as well. The following interventions were considered:<BR/>- Dosage of medication for ovarian stimulation<BR/>- Trigger for ovulation (endogenous LH surge, hCG);<BR/>- Timing of insemination;<BR/>- Single or double insemination per cycle (<LINK REF="REF-Cantineau-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cantineau 2002</LINK>);<BR/>- Semen preparation technique (<LINK REF="REF-Boomsma-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boomsma 2004</LINK>);<BR/>- Number of motile sperm injected;<BR/>- Donor semen or husband/partner semen;<BR/>- Type of insemination device/ catheter;<BR/>- Cancel criteria.</P>
<P>We extracted the following outcomes were extracted from each study when possible:<BR/>- Live births and pregnancies beyond 12 weeks;<BR/>- Multiple pregnancies beyond 12 weeks;<BR/>- Miscarriages;<BR/>- OHSS;<BR/>- Ectopic pregnancy.</P>
<P>The outcomes 'costs of treatment', 'international units (IU) used (when applicable)' and 'number of dominant follicles' were reported in the original protocol, however these were not stated in the final review since we concluded they were of no relevance and making the review too complicated.<BR/>
<B>
<BR/>Statistical analysis</B>
<BR/>We performed statistical analyses in accordance with the guidelines for statistical analysis developed by the Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility group (MDSG).<BR/>
<BR/>For dichotomous data, the results for each study were expressed if appropriate as odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) and combined for meta-analysis with RevMan software. Continuous data were combined for meta-analysis with RevMan software using the weighted mean difference (WMD) with 95% CI.</P>
<P>Heterogeneity between the results of different studies was noted when the confidence intervals did not overlap. This was checked by the results of Chi-squared tests and the I-squared (I2) statistic for inconsistency. The cut-off levels we used were: I<SUP>2</SUP> below 30% a fixed-effect model should be used and a I<SUP>2</SUP> above 60% a random-effect model should be used. Between 30 and 60% the choice of model was based on differences of the studies included. If high quality RCTs were included with comparable patients, the fixed-effect model was used. When statistical heterogeneity was presumed, the random-effect model results were reported as well. Then, the trials were re-studied to detect clinical heterogeneity which was taken into account.</P>
<P>Publication bias was investigated by constructing a funnel graph, plotting sample size versus effect size. A funnel plot was not constructed when insufficient studies were available.</P>
<P>The outcome of live birth rates and pregnancy rates was considered a positive consequence of treatment therefore a higher proportion of women with a live birth or a pregnancy was considered a benefit. For adverse outcomes such as multiple pregnancy rate, miscarriage rate and OHSS rate which are negative consequences, higher numbers were considered to be detrimental (increased odds signifies relative harm). This needs to be taken into consideration when the meta-analyses are viewed.</P>
<P>A priori a subgroup analysis was described for trials comparing two different stimulation protocols in couples with different types of subfertility. Enough studies had to be included (at least two) to make meta-analyses of subgroups possible.<BR/>A priori it was also planned to perform sensitivity analyses if there are more than five trials included in the review to examine stability regarding the direction of outcomes.<BR/>It is the intention of the review authors that a new search for RCTs will be performed every two years and the review updated accordingly.</P>

<P>Reviewing the retrieved trials resulted in exclusion of 31 trials for the following reasons: they either did not perform a comparison of interest (n=7) (<LINK REF="STD-Arcaini-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Arcaini 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Doyle-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Doyle 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jaroudi-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Jaroudi 1998</LINK>;<LINK REF="STD-Nappi-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Nappi 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Papageorgiou-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Papageorgiou 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Steinkampf-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Steinkampf 1993</LINK>;<LINK REF="STD-Tummon-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Tummon 1997</LINK>) or failed to use an adequately randomised design (n=23) (<LINK REF="STD-Allegra-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Allegra 1990</LINK> I; <LINK REF="STD-Allegra-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Allegra 1990</LINK> II; <LINK REF="STD-Alvarez-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Alvarez 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Brami-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Brami 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chang-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Chang 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Check-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Check 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Crosignani-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Crosignani 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-DiMarzo-1992" TYPE="STUDY">DiMarzo 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Isaza-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Isaza 2000</LINK>;<LINK REF="STD-Isaza-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Isaza 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jacobson-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Jacobson 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Manganiello-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Manganiello 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mitwally-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Mitwally 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mitwally-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Mitwally 2003</LINK> I; <LINK REF="STD-Mitwally-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Mitwally 2003</LINK> II; <LINK REF="STD-Mitwally-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Mitwally 2004</LINK>;<LINK REF="STD-Mitwally-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Mitwally 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nava-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Nava 2004</LINK>;<LINK REF="STD-Nuojua_x002d_Huttunen-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Nuojua-Huttunen 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Prentice-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Prentice 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ruddock-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Ruddock 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Taskin-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Taskin 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vasiljevic-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Vasiljevic 2000</LINK>).

<P>Attempts were made to contact the authors by e-mail or letter or both to provide us with details that were not reported and further information about the published data.

<B>Included studies<BR/>
</B>
<BR/>The remaining 43 studies were eligible for inclusion in this systematic review. These trials comprised 3957 women. The total number of treatment cycles was not exactly known because five trials (<LINK REF="STD-Demirol-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Demirol 2002</LINK>;<LINK REF="STD-El-Helw-2002" TYPE="STUDY">El Helw 2002</LINK>;<LINK REF="STD-Fatemi-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Fatemi 2003</LINK>;<LINK REF="STD-Sammour-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Sammour 2001</LINK>;<LINK REF="STD-Unfer-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Unfer 2004</LINK>) did not mention their number.<BR/>Twenty-nine trials presented data that could be pooled in one of the meta-analyses, while the other eight studies could not be pooled for various reasons; they did not provide information about live births or pregnancy rate per couple, although one of these studies (<LINK REF="STD-Nakajima-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Nakajima 1999</LINK>) provided data on secondary outcomes (see table 'Characteristics of included studies'), or it was not possible to derive the correct information from their reports, and we have not received adequate response from requests for the required values through email or letter. This made it impossible to include these studies in the meta-analyses according to the Reviewers' Handbook (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2005</LINK>). Furthermore, the results of one cross-over study were not pooled as first cycle data was lacking (<LINK REF="STD-Dodson-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Dodson 1991</LINK>).<BR/>The remaining five trials compared ovarian stimulation protocols which we did not define beforehand (such as aromatase inhibitors versus gonadotrophins). Subgroup analyses were not performed since each of these studies compared other interventions (<LINK REF="STD-Gerli-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Gerli 2000</LINK>;<LINK REF="STD-Jamal-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Jamal 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kim-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Kim 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Unfer-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Unfer 2004</LINK>;<LINK REF="STD-Wang-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2004</LINK>).<BR/>Pregnancy was confirmed mostly by ultrasound after 7 weeks and ongoing pregnancy with a second ultrasound after 12 weeks of pregnancy.</P>

<BR/>Seven of the eight trials included for this comparison reported the number of women in each treatment arm, including 556 women in total.

The study of <LINK REF="STD-Matorras-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Matorras 2002</LINK> included couples diagnosed with severe male factor and as a result donor sperm was used for intrauterine insemination.<BR/>Three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Ecochard-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Ecochard 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Karlstrom-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Karlstrom 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Karlstrom-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Karlstrom 1998</LINK>) included also other types of subfertility such as endometriosis, ovarian dysfunction and cervical factor.</P>

<P>
<I>Type of interventions</I>
<BR/>Trials comparing clomiphene citrate with gonadotrophins used 50 or 100 mg CC per day for five days and 75 to 150 IU hMG or FSH per day. When 50 mg CC was used for five days this was compared with 75 IU FSH from cycle day 3 to day 7 (<LINK REF="STD-Balasch-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Balasch 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kamel-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Kamel 1995</LINK>). The studies that used 100 mg CC compared this with 75 IU rFSH (<LINK REF="STD-Dankert-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Dankert 2006</LINK>) or 150 IU uFSH or hMG (<LINK REF="STD-Karlstrom-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Karlstrom 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Karlstrom-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Karlstrom 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Matorras-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Matorras 2002</LINK>). Only Ecochard and co-workers used an alternate day scheme for the use of gonadotrophins.</P>
<P>All studies included comparing anti-oestrogens with gonadotrophins used 5000 IU (<LINK REF="STD-Dankert-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Dankert 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ecochard-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Ecochard 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Matorras-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Matorras 2002</LINK>) or 10.000 IU (<LINK REF="STD-Balasch-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Balasch 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kamel-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Kamel 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Karlstrom-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Karlstrom 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Karlstrom-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Karlstrom 1998</LINK>) hCG.

Studies that used LH determination as well, reported a wider interval for insemination from 24 hours after LH determination until 38 hours when no surge was detected. It is questionable whether anticipating on such an unexpected (premature) LH surge results in favourable outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-Cohlen-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cohlen 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>The five studies (<LINK REF="STD-Balasch-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Balasch 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dankert-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Dankert 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ecochard-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Ecochard 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Karlstrom-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Karlstrom 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Matorras-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Matorras 2002</LINK>) which were full publications reported four different semen preparation techniques; swim-up technique, Percoll gradient technique, self-migration with hyaluronic acid and Puresperm respectively. Up until now there is insufficient evidence to recommend any specific preparation technique, due to a lack of large high quality randomised controlled trials, comparing the effectiveness of a gradient or a swim-up or wash and centrifugation technique or all three on clinical outcome (<LINK REF="REF-Boomsma-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boomsma 2004</LINK>).<BR/>All trials performed one intrauterine insemination only.</P>

The number of inseminated motile sperm was reported in three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Balasch-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Balasch 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kamel-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Kamel 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Karlstrom-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Karlstrom 1993</LINK>), and none reported a noteworthy difference between both treatment groups.<BR/>In one study (<LINK REF="STD-Matorras-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Matorras 2002</LINK>) donor semen was used. This study included subfertile couples with severe male subfertility or other indications for using donor semen.

Balasch and co-workers used the IUI catheter in their study, Karlstrom used in his study of 1993 the Kremer catheter or the TDT catheter for insemination and Matorras and co-workers used the Frydman catheter in their study of 2002.</P>

<BR/>All studies included couples diagnosed with unexplained subfertility. One study (<LINK REF="STD-Ozmen-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ozmen 2005</LINK>) included mild-moderate male infertility as well.<BR/>The reported inclusion criteria varied among these studies. While Al-Fozan and co-workers reported that patients were included if patent tubes were seen on hysterosalpingogram and the semen analysis was normal, Fatemi and co-workers stated more criteria: age below 39 years, body mass index between 18 and 29 kg/m2, presence of ovulatory cycles with duration between 24 to 35 days, FSH concentrations on day 3, normal liver and kidney function, negative history for tubal pathology and normal semen analysis. The three remaining publications (all abstracts) (<LINK REF="STD-El-Helw-2002" TYPE="STUDY">El Helw 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ozmen-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ozmen 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sammour-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Sammour 2001</LINK>) did not state inclusion criteria and no further defined unexplained or male factor subfertility.</P>

<I>Type of interventions</I>
<BR/>Both types of drugs were given for five days consecutive in each study, except in one (<LINK REF="STD-El-Helw-2002" TYPE="STUDY">El Helw 2002</LINK>) where a single dose of 20 mg of aromatase inhibitor was compared with anti-oestrogens given for five days. The daily dose of aromatase-inhibitors varied among the trials from 2.5 to 7.5 mg; two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Fatemi-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Fatemi 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sammour-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Sammour 2001</LINK>) compared 2.5 mg letrozole with 100 mg clomiphene citrate.

The fifth included study of Fatemi and co-workers (2003) timed the insemination 24 hours after the endogenous LH surge. This surge was defined as LH concentrations three times higher than the concentration observed in the previous 24 hours.</P>
<P>One study (<LINK REF="STD-Ozmen-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ozmen 2005</LINK>) only reported the type of semen preparation using a density gradient. None of the studies stated explicitly that the husband's semen was used. However, all studies included couples with unexplained subfertility which makes it illogical that they used donor semen. Two studies (<LINK REF="STD-El-Helw-2002" TYPE="STUDY">El Helw 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sammour-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Sammour 2001</LINK>) mentioned that no difference was found between the two groups in semen characteristics, but none of the studies reported the number of motile sperm inseminated.</P>

<I>Type of outcomes</I>
<BR/>None of the studies included reported live birth rates, but they reported pregnancy rates per couple instead.

<BR/>Type of participants </I>
<BR/>Both studies of Filicori and co-workers included couples with unexplained or mild male factor subfertility. The remaining study (<LINK REF="STD-Gerli-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Gerli 1993</LINK>) included couples with unexplained subfertility only. Type of subfertility was not defined explicitly in one of the three studies, but inclusion criteria consisted of: no ovulatory dysfunction, a body mass index between 17 to 25 kg/m2, a pelvic ultrasound showing normal uterus and ovaries, hysterosalpingogram and/or laparoscopy demonstrating tubal patency and normal hormone analysis in the studies of Filicori and co-workers. The study of Gerli and co-workers reported inclusion criteria as no ovulatory dysfunction, tubal or uterine factor, or male factor or both.</P>
<P>The age of women included was stated in all three trials. The mean age in the FSH group was 31.6 ± 1.5 years compared to 32.3 ± 1.7 years in the hMG group. One trial (<LINK REF="STD-Gerli-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Gerli 1993</LINK>) reported the mean duration of subfertility per treatment group: 2.3 ± 0.6 years for the FSH group and 2.6 ± 0.8 years for the hMG group. Filicori and co-workers mentioned in both publications that some of the women included had received ovulation induction previously, but not for at least three months preceding the study. Gerli and co-workers did not state whether previous fertility treatment was given. None of the studies reported primary or secondary subfertility.</P>
<P>
<I>Type of interventions</I>
<BR/>Both studies of Filicori and co-workers used 150 IU gonadotrophins in both treatment arms and the third study (<LINK REF="STD-Gerli-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Gerli 1993</LINK>) used 225 IU FSH or hMG. All studies applied a single dose of LHRH agonist in the preceding luteal phase.</P>

In both studies Filicori and co-workers performed a single insemination 36 hours after 10.000 IU hCG. Gerli and co-workers performed two inseminations, one 12 hours and one 36 hours after 5000 IU hCG.<BR/>All studies used a swim-up technique for semen preparation. Of the three studies one study (<LINK REF="STD-Filicori-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Filicori 2003</LINK>) stated explicitly that partners' semen was used, but it is likely that the other two studies used partners' semen as well. The second study of <LINK REF="STD-Filicori-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Filicori 2003</LINK>, also found no difference between the treatment groups concerning sperm count and sperm motility. However, none of the studies reported the number of motile sperm inseminated.</P>

<I>Type of interventions </I>
<BR/>Different dosages of drugs and different schedules were used in all trials. The first study of Carrera (<LINK REF="STD-Carrera-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Carrera 2002</LINK> (I)) stimulated with 100 IU r-FSH per day from cycle day 3 onwards in both groups. Procrin was used as GnRH agonist; 1 mg per day from cycle day 21 of the preceding cycle and 0.5 mg from cycle day 3 of the stimulation cycle. In the second study of Carrera (<LINK REF="STD-Carrera-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Carrera 2002</LINK> (II)) women were stimulated with 75 IU r-FSH in both treatment groups. Decapeptyl was used as GnRH agonist 0.1 mg per day from the preceding cycle day 21 onwards and 0.05 mg from cycle day 3. The third study (<LINK REF="STD-Dodson-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Dodson 1991</LINK>) stimulated with 75 IU hMG from cycle day 7 in the gonadotrophins only group and in the gonadotrophin/GnRH agonist group leuprolide 1 mg/day was applied in the luteal phase 4 to 7 days before the onset of menstrual period combined with 75 to 225 IU hMG from cycle day 2 onwards. Pattuelli and co-workers applied 150 IU FSH in both treatment groups and LHRH from the mid luteal phase of the preceding cycle in the group where a GnRH agonist was applied. Finally, Sengoku and co-workers stimulated with 150 IU hMG per day in both groups. In the treatment group where a GnRH agonist was applied this was done from cycle day 1; 0.3 mg buserelin acetate three times a day.</P>

Gomez and co-workers started with 100 IU FSH on cycle day 3 to 4 and when the recruited follicles were 16 mm or larger or E2 levels were &gt; 300 pg/ml, 0.25 mg Ganirelix was subcutaneously injected daily until hCG was given. Lambalk and co-workers started from day 2 to 3 of menstrual cycle with r-FSH of which the dose was determined by the investigator based on patient's characteristics and history. Ganirelix or placebo was given (double-blind design) when one or more follicles &gt; 14 mm were seen, until hCG was given. Ragni and co-workers started with a fixed dose of 150 IU r-FSH from day 3 of the cycle until hCG administration. Cetrorelix was started from the day when a follicle &gt; 14 mm in mean diameter was visualized until hCG injection. Scheiber and co-workers started with 150 IU r-FSH on cycle day 2 to 3 and Ganirelix 0.25 mg was given when the dominant follicle was 14 mm, E2 &gt; 600 pg/ml or LH &gt; 7.5 IU/l. Williams and co-workers started with 150 IU r-FSH on day 2 to 3. On day 6 Ganirelix 0.25 mg was initiated and was continued until administration of hCG.<BR/>All five studies used hCG for timing of a single insemination. However, Ragni and co-workers timed an insemination with LH urinary test in the control group. All but one study (<LINK REF="STD-Ragni-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Ragni 2001</LINK>) reported the time interval between hCG injection and insemination. This time interval varied slightly between the studies, but all inseminations were planned 32-42 hours after hCG injection. The semen preparation technique was stated in one study (<LINK REF="STD-Gomez-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Gomez 2005</LINK>) that used a swim-up technique. None of the studies mentioned explicitly that partners semen was used, although this was most likely. One study (<LINK REF="STD-Williams-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Williams 2004</LINK>) reported the number of sperm inseminated in each group which was comparable. Both Gomez (2005) and Scheiber (2003) stated a slight difference of injected motile sperm between both treatment arms. Only Gomez and co-workers reported the type of insemination catheter (a Lee catheter)<BR/>Cancellation criteria were mentioned in two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Gomez-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Gomez 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ragni-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Ragni 2001</LINK>). Gomez and co-workers stated that cycles were cancelled when more than 4 follicles had a diameter of more than 16 mm. Ragni and co-workers stated that cycles were cancelled when more than 6 follicles had a diameter of 14 mm or more or less than 2 follicles had a size of 14 mm. The remaining three studies did not report any cancellation criteria.</P>

<I>8. Gonadotrophins alone versus gonadotrophins combined with anti-oestrogens</I>
</B>
<BR/>One study (<LINK REF="STD-Ransom-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Ransom 1996</LINK>) compared gonadotrophins alone with gonadotrophins combined with anti-oestrogens. This publication was a full-text paper. Data of 98 women were available.</P>
<P>All couples who were to undergo OH with IUI were enrolled in this study. Indications were: unexplained and male factor subfertility, endometriosis, cervical factor, ovulatory dysfunction, PCOS and women with surgically corrected pelvic adhesions.<BR/>All participants had to have had a preliminary infertility investigation, including hysterosalpingogram, postcoital test, semen analysis and hormonal analysis.</P>
<P>The mean age of the women was 32.9±4.8 years in the group stimulated with gonadotrophins only and 32.3±3.4 years in the group where anti-oestrogens were added. Duration of subfertility was not stated. Previous fertility treatment consisted of at least three unsuccessful cycles with anti-oestrogens. Previous treatment with gonadotrophins was reason for exclusion.<BR/>Whether couples suffered from primary subfertility was not reported.</P>
<P>
<I>Type of interventions</I>
<BR/>Ransom and co-workers compared a daily dose of 150 IU hMG from cycle day 3 onwards with 100 mg CC from cycle day 3 to 7 combined with 150 IU hMG on cycle day 7, 9 and 11. When no mature-sized follicles were present by day 12, hMG was continued until a follicle of 18 mm or more was detected.<BR/>5000 IU hCG were used to induce ovulation and 34-36 hours later one insemination was performed. A standard swim up technique was used for semen preparation. It was not stated explicitly that partner semen was used, although this was most likely, since therapeutic donor insemination candidates were excluded. The number of injected motile sperm was stated and was not significant different between both groups (37.2 versus 42.4 x 106). The type of insemination catheter was not reported. An additional hCG injection was applied for luteal support.<BR/>Cancellation criteria were not stated.<BR/>
<I>
<BR/>Type of outcomes</I>
<BR/>Pregnancy rates per group were stated as well as multiple pregnancy rates, miscarriage rates and ectopic pregnancies. Ransom and co-workers did not report OHSS rates.</P>

Ovulation was triggered with 10.000 IU hCG and one insemination was performed 24 hours later. The semen preparation technique and the type of insemination catheter were not stated. It was not stated explicitly that partners semen was used, although this was most likely. The number of injected spermatozoa was not reported and cancellation criteria were not stated.</P>
<P>
<I>Type of outcomes</I>

<BR/>Four studies (<LINK REF="STD-Dhaliwal-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Dhaliwal 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hughes-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Hughes 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ragni-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Ragni 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sengoku-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Sengoku 1999</LINK>) were included comparing different dosage regimens for gonadotrophins.<BR/>All four articles were full-text papers. In total data of 297 women could be pooled.</P>
<P>Two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Dhaliwal-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Dhaliwal 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sengoku-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Sengoku 1999</LINK>) included couples with unexplained and ovulatory dysfunction with CC failure. Hughes and co-workers included women with endometriosis and tubal disease as well. <LINK REF="STD-Ragni-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Ragni 2004</LINK> included couples with unexplained subfertility, male factor subfertility, endometriosis and PCOS.</P>
<P>The infertility work-up differed between the four studies. All studies performed cycle analysis, hormone analysis, semen analysis and hysterosalpingography or laparoscopy or both. Cervical mucus testing was done in two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Dhaliwal-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Dhaliwal 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sengoku-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Sengoku 1999</LINK>). Additionally, one study (<LINK REF="STD-Sengoku-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Sengoku 1999</LINK>) performed an endometrial biopsy and a basal body temperature curve. <LINK REF="STD-Ragni-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Ragni 2004</LINK>) used a body mass index between 19 to 30 to include women.</P>
<P>The age of women was stated in all four trials. Two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Dhaliwal-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Dhaliwal 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sengoku-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Sengoku 1999</LINK>) compared low dose gonadotrophins (75 IU/day) with high dose gonadotrophin (150 IU/day) and the mean ages of the women were 30.2±3.9 years and 31.5±4.0 years respectively. One study (<LINK REF="STD-Hughes-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Hughes 1998</LINK>) had three treatment groups. Ragni and co-workers (<LINK REF="STD-Ragni-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Ragni 2004</LINK>) reported a mean age of 33.1±3.0 years in the high dose group and 32.1±6.6 in the low dose group.<BR/>The mean duration of subfertility was stated in all 4 studies. Duration of subfertility was comparable between studies. However, <LINK REF="STD-Dhaliwal-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Dhaliwal 2002</LINK> reported a mean duration of 6.1±2.8 years in the low dose group versus 6.9±2.9 years in the high dose group in contrast to the other three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Hughes-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Hughes 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ragni-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Ragni 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sengoku-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Sengoku 1999</LINK>) that reported a mean duration of subfertility of 3.9±2.2 years, 3.1±1.2 years and 4.4±2.3 years respectively.<BR/>Previous fertility treatment was reported in all studies but differed. Dhaliwal and co-workers reported five to six cycles CC use, Hughes and co-workers reported that 90% of the included women had CC with IUI before, Ragni (2004) reported previous fertility treatment was performed but no IUI and finally, Sengoku (1999) reported previous CC treatment. Three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Dhaliwal-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Dhaliwal 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hughes-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Hughes 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sengoku-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Sengoku 1999</LINK>) reported the percentage of primary subfertility which was 76%, 67% and 70% respectively.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Dhaliwal-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Dhaliwal 2002</LINK> started with 100 mg CC on cycle day 3 for five days in both groups combined with 75 to 150 IU hMG daily from cycle day 5 in the conventional protocol and 150 IU hMG once on cycle day 9 in the minimal stimulation protocol. <LINK REF="STD-Hughes-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Hughes 1998</LINK> compared three different stimulation protocols: Women in group A applied 150 IU r-FSH on cycle day 4 and 75 IU r-FSH on cycle day 6 and 8; women in group B applied 150 IU r-FSH on cycle day 4, 6 and 8 and women in group C applied 150 IU on cycle day 4, 6, 8 and 10. Ragni (2004) compared two stimulation protocols: 50 IU r-FSH per day combined with a 0.25 mg GnRH antagonist from the day in which a follicle &gt; 13 mm in mean diameter was visualized compared to 50 IU r-FSH on alternate days combined with the same GnRH antagonist. Finally, Sengoku (1999) compared 150 IU u-FSH daily, both from cycle day 3 onwards.</P>
<P>All four studies used hCG for timing of a single insemination. However, timing after hCG differed among the studies; two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Hughes-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Hughes 1998</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Sengoku-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Sengoku 1999</LINK>) timed the insemination 24 to 28 hours after hCG injection and two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Dhaliwal-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Dhaliwal 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ragni-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Ragni 2004</LINK>) timed insemination 34 to 40 hours after hCG injection. Furthermore, Sengoku and co-workers adjusted timing of insemination when an LH rise was detected.<BR/>The semen preparation technique was stated in two studies: <LINK REF="STD-Dhaliwal-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Dhaliwal 2002</LINK> used a swim-up technique, and <LINK REF="STD-Sengoku-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Sengoku 1999</LINK> used a double washing technique. None of the studies mentioned explicitly that partner semen was used, although this was most likely. None of the studies stated the number of injected motile sperm. Two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Dhaliwal-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Dhaliwal 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sengoku-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Sengoku 1999</LINK>) reported the type of insemination catheter (IUI cannula and Tomcat catheter).<BR/>Cancellation criteria were reported in two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Hughes-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Hughes 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ragni-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Ragni 2004</LINK>). The first study stated that cycles were cancelled if no follicles developed on cycle day 18 or when more than 2 follicles reached a size of 17 mm or more. The second study stated that cycles were cancelled when more than 2 follicles &gt; 14 mm. The remaining studies (<LINK REF="STD-Dhaliwal-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Dhaliwal 2002</LINK> ; <LINK REF="STD-Sengoku-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Sengoku 1999</LINK>) did not state any cancellation criteria.<BR/>

<P>All but one study (<LINK REF="STD-Ecochard-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Ecochard 2000</LINK>) used a parallel design. Discussion remains regarding the most accurate study design. Pros and cons of parallel and cross-over methods have been discussed extensively (<LINK REF="REF-Cohlen-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cohlen 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Daya-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Daya 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Khan-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Khan 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Olive-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Olive 1995</LINK>) and the Handbook of the Cochrane Collaboration advises to include studies with a parallel design only and cross-over trials only when pre cross-over data is available.

<BR/>Two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Filicori-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Filicori 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Filicori-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Filicori 2003</LINK>) comparing 150 IU FSH daily with 150 IU hMG daily reported multiple pregnancy rates per treatment group. Data of 100 couples were available. Four multiple pregnancies were reported in the hMG-group with 50 couples and five in the r-FSH group with also 50 couples resulting in a non significant difference (OR 1.27, 95% CI 0.32 to 5.0). With 150 IU FSH daily five multiples were seen out of nine pregnancies (MPR per pregnancy: 56%); with 150 IU hMG daily four multiple pregnancies were seen out of 13 pregnancies (MPR per pregnancy: 30%). This result was not statistically significant different (OR 2.88, 95% CI 0.49 to 16.8).</P>

<I>Miscarriage rates </I>
<BR/>Both studies of Filicori and co-workers reported miscarriage rates per couple and per pregnancy. In both groups of 50 couples each two miscarriages were reported, resulting in a non-significant difference (OR 1.0, 95% CI 0.14 to 7.4). In the FSH group two miscarriages were reported out of nine pregnancies (miscarriage rate per pregnancy: 22%) with hMG two miscarriages were seen out of 13 pregnancies (miscarriage rate per pregnancy: 15%).

Data were available for 324 couples. Multiple pregnancy rate per couple revealed a non-significant difference between the treatment groups (OR 2.7, 95% CI 0.96 to 7.4). With gonadotrophins alone five multiple pregnancies were seen out of 37 pregnancies (MPR per pregnancy: 14%); gonadotrophins combined with a GnRH agonist resulted in 13 multiple pregnancies out of 33 pregnancies (MPR per pregnancy: 39%).

<P>Intra-uterine insemination combined with OH has been proven effective for couples with unexplained and mild male factor subfertility (<LINK REF="REF-Cohlen-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cohlen 2000</LINK>;<LINK REF="REF-Verhulst-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Verhulst 2006</LINK>). Compared with IVF, IUI with OH is less invasive and more cost-effective (<LINK REF="REF-Goverde-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goverde 2000</LINK>). There remains discussion regarding the optimal stimulation drug and protocol not only taken into account the probability of conception but also unwanted side-effects (multiples, OHSS) and costs.</P>
<P>The aim of this review was to evaluate different ovarian stimulation protocols for intrauterine insemination for all indications with regard to live birth rates, pregnancy rates, multiples, miscarriages and OHSS rate. Data could be pooled for six of the eleven comparisons stated in the method section of this review. Of course there are a number of methodological considerations to be taken into account when interpreting the results. We will discuss each comparisons in detail.</P>
<P>
<B>Comparison 1: Anti-oestrogens compared with gonadotrophins<BR/>
</B>
<BR/>The results demonstrated that in an IUI program ovarian stimulation with gonadotrophins increases pregnancy rates per couple significantly, compared to anti-oestrogens, without effecting adverse outcomes. However, these results are not very robust and clinical differences should be taken into account.<BR/>One of the differences between the studies included is that <LINK REF="STD-Matorras-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Matorras 2002</LINK> used donor sperm for insemination treating severe male factor subfertility (41% azoospermia), single women or couples where protected intercourse was necessary due to a HIV positive status of one of the partners. Thus, one might conclude that they did not treat subfertile women but healthy women not yet subjected to the chance of achieving conception. Although Matorras and co-workers compared FSH with CC, which was the comparison of interest, we performed a sensitivity analysis excluding this trial. The pooled effect of this latter analysis showed higher pregnancy rates using gonadotrophins compared to clomiphene citrate but this effect was no longer statistically significant (OR 1.4 95% CI 0.86 to 2.3).<BR/>Another meta-analysis, performed by <LINK REF="REF-Hughes-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hughes 1997</LINK>, concluded that gonadotrophins seem to be more effective compared with CC. This statement was based on twenty-two trials of which three investigated this comparison directly. <LINK REF="REF-Costello-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Costello 2004</LINK> also reviewed studies comparing CC with gonadotrophins both combined with IUI. They included three studies in their meta-analysis that showed a significant higher pregnancy rate per cycle when treated with gonadotrophins. All three studies included in their review were included in this present review, but in addition we included four more trials.</P>
<P>Other confounding clinical factors that might influence the results of this comparison might be the dosage of anti-oestrogens or gonadotrophins used. All studies used comparable dosages of gonadotrophins (75 to150 IU) and anti-oestrogens (50 to100 mg) but different regimens. <LINK REF="STD-Balasch-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Balasch 1994</LINK> started with gonadotrophins 75 IU on cycle day 7 only, whereas other studies started on cycle day 3.<BR/>Another striking clinical difference was that <LINK REF="STD-Ecochard-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Ecochard 2000</LINK> stimulated with 150 IU gonadotrophins on day 4, 6, 8 and 9 of the cycle instead of daily injections such as in the other six trials. Stimulation on alternating days was also done in an other study (<LINK REF="STD-Hughes-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Hughes 1998</LINK>) with disappointing results, which might indicate that a daily dosage of ovarian stimulation is necessary instead of this form of 'coasting'.<BR/>Apart from this, <LINK REF="STD-Ecochard-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Ecochard 2000</LINK> was the only trialist to use a different method for timing insemination depending on the detection of spontaneous LH surges. They inseminated 36 hours after hCG or 24 hours after a detected LH surge, while the other studies inseminated between 35 and 42 hours after hCG injection only. Unfortunately, the study results did not report whether spontaneous LH surges were seen significantly more in one of two treatment groups. Extracting this study from the meta-analysis shows a statistically significant difference in favour of gonadotrophins (OR 2.00 95% CI 1.29 to 3.10).<BR/>The methodological quality of the six trials included was similar: all but one (<LINK REF="STD-Ecochard-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Ecochard 2000</LINK>) used a parallel design and three trials mentioned an adequate method of randomisation (<LINK REF="STD-Dankert-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Dankert 2006</LINK>;<LINK REF="STD-Ecochard-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Ecochard 2000</LINK>;<LINK REF="STD-Matorras-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Matorras 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>Although it is generally believed that gonadotrophins results in significant higher multiple pregnancy rates compared to clomiphene citrate, we could not conclude this with the available data.<BR/>
<BR/>
<B>Comparison 4: Anti-oestrogens compared with aromatase inhibitors<BR/>
</B>
<BR/>None of the trials solely or in combination provided convincing evidence of a significant difference. It has been suggested that clomiphene citrate would result in higher miscarriage rates compared to letrozole as reported by one of the smaller studies included (<LINK REF="STD-Al_x002d_Fozan-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Al-Fozan 2004</LINK>). More evidence is needed to confirm this observation. Since costs are important it is important to realize that letrozole costs ten times more than clomiphene citrate (<LINK REF="REF-Kompas-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kompas 2001</LINK>). This aspect should be considered when there is no evidence of benefit. All trials used a parallel design and two studies mentioned adequate methods of randomization.</P>

<B>Comparison 5: Gonadotrophins alone compared with gonadotrophins alone for example FSH versus HMG<BR/>
</B>
<BR/>There is no convincing evidence of a difference comparing r-FSH with u-FSH combining both treatments with IUI. However, there are confounding factors that might influence this conclusion.<BR/>Among these factors are: 1. Different daily dosages of gonadotrophins were used and compared. Both studies of <LINK REF="STD-Gerli-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Gerli 2004</LINK> compared a higher dose of urinary FSH (75 IU) with a lower dose of recombinant FSH (50 IU), which might result in lower pregnancy rates with recombinant FSH than expected when the same dose would have been used. However, in view of the apparent increased bioactivity of recombinant FSH over urinary FSH products one might consider this a correct comparison (<LINK REF="REF-Out-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Out 1995</LINK>). The other studies in the meta-analysis compared similar dosages of r-FSH and u-FSH (<LINK REF="STD-Matorras-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Matorras 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pares-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Pares 2002</LINK>) that showed a non-significant trend in favour of r-FSH (OR 1.4 95% CI 0.83 to 2.5). The same has been concluded for patients suffering from clomiphene citrate resistant chronic anovulation (<LINK REF="REF-Coelingh-Bennink1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Coelingh Bennink1998</LINK>), but it has also been refuted by others (<LINK REF="REF-Yarali-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yarali 1999</LINK>).<BR/>2. Timing of insemination. All studies inseminated once between 32 to 40 hours after hCG injection; only <LINK REF="STD-Pares-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Pares 2002</LINK> inseminated twice (20 and 40 hours after hCG). A previous Cochrane review did not detect an additional value of a second insemination (<LINK REF="REF-Cantineau-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cantineau 2003</LINK>).<BR/>Nowadays costs should be included into decision making, whereas u-FSH is 33 to 50 % cheaper (<LINK REF="REF-Kompas-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kompas 2001</LINK>;<LINK REF="STD-Gerli-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Gerli 2004</LINK>). On the other hand, according to previous literature recombinant products have certain advantages such as higher batch-to-batch consistency, high purity, avoiding injection of potentially allergenic proteins, the likelihood of reducing the risk of infectious particles, rendering the production independent of urine collection and the elimination of drugs co-extracted from urine. (<LINK REF="STD-Matorras-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Matorras 2000</LINK>;<LINK REF="REF-No-authors-listed-98" TYPE="REFERENCE">No authors listed 98</LINK>). All trials were methodological comparable and used a parallel design and adequate randomisation methods.</P>
<P>This review has also shown there is no evidence to suggest which is better FSH or hMG. There was no significant difference between the treatments, but the trials were too small to draw firm conclusions.<BR/>When the studies were compared in detail, clinical heterogeneity was observed; <LINK REF="STD-Gerli-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Gerli 1993</LINK> used a higher dose of gonadotrophins (225 IU) in both treatment groups compared to the other studies (150 IU).Moreover, a LHRH agonist was given during the luteal phase, which is different from the other studies. When the studies of Filicori were pooled (<LINK REF="STD-Filicori-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Filicori 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Filicori-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Filicori 2003</LINK>) neither of the two types of gonadotrophins was significantly better (OR 1.60, 95% CI 0.61 to 4.17).<BR/>There was a significant reduction in the total amount of gonadotropins used in favour of hMG, which should be taken into account regarding treatment costs. The same was concluded for in vitro fertilisation and intracytoplasmic sperm injection cycles recently (<LINK REF="REF-Al_x002d_Inany-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Al-Inany 2005</LINK>). All trials used a parallel design and none of the trials mentioned the method of randomisation.</P>
<P>
<B>Comparison 6: Gonadotrophins alone compared with gonadotrophins with GnRH agonists<BR/>
</B>
<BR/>There is evidence that adding a GnRH agonist to gonadotrophins does not improve pregnancy rates, while increasing the probability of achieving a multiple pregnancy.<BR/>Comparing the studies in detail did not provide large differences in potential clinical confounding factors. Only <LINK REF="STD-Sengoku-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Sengoku 1994</LINK> used a different timing of insemination; 24 to 28 hours after hCG, which did not show completely bad results in pregnancy rates although previous literature (<LINK REF="REF-Andersen-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Andersen 1995</LINK>) stated that the time interval between hCG injection to follicular rupture is approximately 38 hours, which might be the perfect moment for insemination. One study (<LINK REF="STD-Sengoku-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Sengoku 1994</LINK>) had a cross-over design, but the first data only were used. Only one study mentioned their method of randomisation (<LINK REF="STD-Carrera-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Carrera 2002</LINK>). In conclusion, adding GnRH agonists to gonadotrophins does not improve treatment outcome. Bearing these data in mind, together with the fact that GnRH agonists are expensive, their use should be carefully considered in an intrauterine insemination program. This conclusion is in line with a previous publication ( <LINK REF="REF-Dodson-1991-II" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dodson 1991 II</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<B>Comparison 7: Gonadotrophins alone compared with gonadotrophins with GnRH antagonists<BR/>
</B>
<BR/>Adding a GnRH antagonist showed promising results. Analysing the largest study (<LINK REF="STD-Lambalk-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Lambalk 2006</LINK>) in detail that included 100 couples in each treatment arm, reported the use of a placebo which filtered out possible bias. However, the amount of gonadotrophins applied in this trial was unclear because the starting dosage depended on the choice of the investigator treating the patient.<BR/>Another study in this analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Gomez-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Gomez 2005</LINK>), which showed a significant difference favouring treatment with a GnRH antagonist, started to apply the antagonist only when the dominant follicle reached a size of 16 mm or when the oestradiol levels were higher than 300 pg/ml. While the other trials started with a GnRH antagonist when dominant follicles reached a size of 14 mm. Moreover, there was a significant difference found in the number of dominant follicles at the moment of hCG injection between treatment groups in this study of Gomez and co-workers (higher number of dominant follicles in the group treated with GnRH antagonists). A placebo was not used and therefore clinicians were not blinded in this study. This might have lead the clinicians to stimulate ovaries more aggressively when an antagonist was added, resulting in significantly more dominant follicles in the antagonist group, and thus more pregnancies. This should be taken into account when the results of the meta-analysis are interpreted. It is clear that future well-randomised trials, consisting of at least 300 couples, should lead to a definite answer whether GnRH antagonist are cost-effective and efficient.</P>
<P>
<B>Comparison 10: Different dosage regimens for gonadotrophins (High dose (more than75 IU per day) versus low dose gonadotrophins (75 IU or less per day)) </B>
<BR/>Based on small numbers our results show that doubling the daily dose of gonadotrophins per day from 75 IU to 150 IU does not result in improvement of treatment outcome.<BR/>There may be a minimum acquired dose of gonadotrophins because both Hughes and Ragni reported extremely low pregnancy rates when a very low-dose regimen is given on alternating days. This might also be an effect of the alternating day regimen, although the half-life for r-FSH is around 30 to 40 hours (<LINK REF="REF-Mannaerts-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mannaerts 1996</LINK>).<BR/>Considering cost-effectiveness, this is an important finding. Especially when multiple pregnancies are taken into account as well.<BR/>Multiple pregnancy rates have been discussed extensively in literature (<LINK REF="REF-Fauser-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fauser 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nan-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nan 1994</LINK>). Using high dose gonadotrophins seems to lead to more multiple pregnancies without improving pregnancy rates significantly, which is an interesting outcome of this review. Of course, these results are based on relative small numbers with a wide confidence interval. However, there is increasing evidence from national registries, that mild ovarian hyperstimulation combined with national guidelines of cancellation criteria reduces the risks of multiples (&lt; 10 % twins and 1% triplets) with acceptable pregnancy rates per cycle and couple (;<LINK REF="REF-Haagen-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haagen 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Steures" TYPE="REFERENCE">Steures</LINK> 2006).<BR/>Finally, the results imply, based on available data of 297 couples, that OHSS rate is significantly higher when a high dose stimulation protocol is used. It seems logical to assume that the more aggressive an ovarian stimulation protocol is, the higher OHSS rates will be.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2010-11-18 14:38:22 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We advise the authors of the NICE guidelines to take into account the up-to-date evidence presented in this review.</P>
<P>1. Based on the available results gonadotrophins might be the most effective drugs when IUI is combined with ovarian hyperstimulation. However, this result is not very robust and more research is needed. Anti-oestrogens appear to be cost effective in IUI programs, although they seem somewhat less effective compared to gonadotrophins. Users should be aware of the fact that anti-oestrogens do not prevent multiples and that an anti-oestrogenic effect on the endometrium has been reported.<BR/>2. When gonadotrophins are applied we advise to apply it on a daily basis. Low dose protocols (50 to 75 IU per day) are advised since pregnancy rates do not seem to differ significantly from pregnancy rates with high dose regimens (&gt; 75 IU per day) whereas the changes to encounter negative effects from ovarian stimulation, such as the risk of multiples and the risk of OHSS might be higher with high dose protocols.<BR/>3. There seems to be no role for GnRH-agonists in IUI programs as they increase costs tremendously and increase the number of multiples without increasing the probability of conception. We therefore advise not to use GnRH agonists in this setting, if mild ovarian hyperstimulation is applied.<BR/>4. Whether or not urinary gonadotrophins should be used as first choice compared with recombinant products is more a discussion of purity, trace ability and costs. There is no convincing evidence of a significant difference in the probability of conception.<BR/>5. Whether or not GnRH-antagonists are going to play a role in mild ovarian hyperstimulation/IUI programs needs to be determined in future trials.<BR/>6. From the available data there is no convincing evidence that letrozole is superior to clomiphene citrate and therefore the cost should be taken into account when using anti-oestrogens.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>In general, it is important to provide data about the efficacy of ovarian stimulation combined with IUI for all women suffering from subfertility. However, clear definition of the study population is also needed to assess the effectiveness of treatment in daily practice. Using placebos in a control group will improve the quality of studies.<BR/>Suggested randomised controlled trials that need to be done:<BR/>To compare clomiphene citrate with gonadotrophins combined with IUI in a prospective designed randomised study for unexplained subfertility (including power calculation)<BR/>To compare clomiphene citrate with gonadotrophins combined with IUI in a prospective designed randomised study for mild male factor subfertility (including power calculation)<BR/>To compare gonadotrophins with gonadotrophins combined with a GnRH antagonist in a prospective randomised study including cost-efficacy for unexplained and mild male subfertility.</P>

<P>Recently, we started a large randomised controlled trial comparing recFSH with a GnRH antagonist with recFSH alone. This is an investigators-initiated trial.<BR/>Medication used in this trial has been supplied by Serono B.V. only. Serono B.V. is unable to interfere with the results of this RCT and they have had no influence on this Cochrane review. In conclusion, all three authors have involvement in primary research in the subject area of our review, but no personal financial support has been gained. </P>
