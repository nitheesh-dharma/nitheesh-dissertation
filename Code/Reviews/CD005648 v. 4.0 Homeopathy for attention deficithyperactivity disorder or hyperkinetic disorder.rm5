<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>This review aimed to assess the evidence for homeopathy as an intervention for attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Four trials were retrieved and assessed with mixed results. Overall the results of this review found no evidence of effectiveness for homeopathy for the global symptoms, core symptoms or related outcomes of attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder. </P>

</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Homeopathy is one form of complementary/alternative medicine which is promoted as being a safe and effective form of treatment for children and adults. Within the UK homeopathy use is estimated at 1.9% of the adult population (Thomas 2004), and around 11% for children under 16 years (Simpson 2001). There has been increased interest in homeopathy's potential as a non-pharmacological intervention for attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder as an alternative to the use of stimulant medications such as Ritalin. Homeopathy is a system of medicine based on the principle of treating "like with like" using various dilutions of natural or man-made substances. Homeopathy focuses on the unique characteristics of each patient's experience and symptomatology and uses this information to determine the appropriate prescription for each patient.<BR/> </P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To assess the safety and effectiveness of homeopathy as a treatment for attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>We searched a wide set of databases from their inception to March 2006 including: CENTRAL, MEDLINE, AMED, BIOSIS, CISCOM, CINAHL, Dissertation Abstracts, ECH (European Committee for Homeopathy thesis database), EMBASE, ERIC, HomInform (Glasgow Homeopathic Hospital Library), LILACS, PsycINFO, Science Citation Index, SIGLE, GIRI - International congress on ultra-low doses, Liga Medicorum Homeopathica Internationalis.<BR/>We contacted experts in the field about ongoing or current research.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>All studies where individualised, clinical or formula homeopathy had been used to treat participants with ADHD or HKD who were randomly or quasi-randomly allocated to either true treatment or a control were selected. Control groups could include wait-list, no treatment, medication, placebo homeopathy, educational or behavioural interventions.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Data from four eligible studies (total n = 168) were extracted and entered into RevMan. Results were synthesised and estimates of the effect sizes were calculated and presented as appropriate (using standardised mean differences) in both graphical and narrative form (narrative only was used where no effect size calculation was possible).</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>The forms of homeopathy evaluated to date do not suggest significant treatment effects for the global symptoms, core symptoms of inattention, hyperactivity or impulsivity, or related outcomes such as anxiety in Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder. </P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>There is currently little evidence for the efficacy of homeopathy for the treatment of ADHD. Development of optimal treatment protocols is recommended prior to further randomised controlled trials being undertaken.</P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-11-08 18:08:37 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2008-11-08 18:07:45 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) has only existed as a diagnostic category since 1980, with the publication of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) Version III (<LINK REF="REF-Barkley-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barkley 1990</LINK>). Hyperactivity syndrome began to be distinguished from brain damage syndromes in the 1960s. Since the 1970s hyperactivity syndrome has been closely associated with attention deficits, leading to wide acceptance in some circles that ADHD is a complex disorder with both developmental and biological underpinnings. There is an ongoing debate around the social construction of ADHD as a disease category (<LINK REF="REF-Brady-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brady 2004</LINK> <LINK REF="REF-Cooper-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cooper 1999</LINK>) and there is as yet no clear consensus on the underlying aetiology. Brain imaging and genetic research are current areas of interest, but observation of behaviour remains the basis of diagnosis in the absence of reliable tests for biological markers.</P>
<P>DSM-IV diagnostic criteria for ADHD include the 'core' signs of inattention, hyperactivity and impulsiveness. They also recognize three subgroups of ADHD: i) predominantly hyperactive-impulsive type (not showing significant inattention); ii) predominantly inattentive type (not showing significant hyperactive-impulsive behaviour); and iii) combined type (displaying inattentive and hyperactive-impulsive symptoms) (<LINK REF="REF-APA-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">APA 2000</LINK>). Hyperkinetic disorder (HKD) is the term used in ICD-10 (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1992</LINK>), and refers to a more seriously affected subgroup, similar to patients diagnosed as having DSM-IV 'combined type'.</P>
<P>Diagnosis is usually determined by child/adolescent psychiatrists or paediatricians according to either the DSM-IV or the ICD-10. Both sets of diagnostic criteria state that for a diagnosis of ADHD/HKD symptoms must have been present for at least six months, causing distress and in conflict with the child's developmental level, and impairment should present and be apparent in two or more settings. The symptoms should have been present before the age of 7 years, and should not be better explained by an alternative diagnosis.</P>
<P>Using ICD-10 criteria, prevalence has been estimated at around 1% of school-aged children in the UK, increasing to 5% if DSM-IV criteria are used. This translates to around 366,000 children in England and Wales (<LINK REF="REF-Lord-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lord 2000</LINK>). A US population-based birth cohort study of 5,781 children estimated a prevalence of 7.5% at age 19 years using DSM-IV criteria (<LINK REF="REF-Barbaresi-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barbaresi 2004</LINK>). Lower UK prevalence may be due to the use of the narrower ICD-10 criteria, and to diagnosing the condition only after referral to secondary care, among other factors. ADHD can affect both males (more commonly) and females, of any ethnicity. The affected population has generally been defined as children and adolescents to age 18 years. After this point the patient is usually referred to adult services although in some areas this occurs at age 16 (<LINK REF="REF-ADDISS-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">ADDISS 2003</LINK>). ADHD persists in 30% to 70% of adults having had the disorder in childhood, and a self-report screening scale for detection of ADHD in general adult populations without a previous diagnosis is under development and has shown reasonable concordance with blind clinical diagnoses in a US community sample (<LINK REF="REF-Kessler-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kessler 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>Currently available treatments for ADHD include behavioural training for teachers and parents, and parenting skills classes. Drug therapy began in the 1930s (<LINK REF="REF-Bradley-1937" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bradley 1937</LINK>), and started to attract attention in the 1950s (<LINK REF="REF-Laufer-1957" TYPE="REFERENCE">Laufer 1957</LINK>). Since the 1970s, stimulant medications such as dexamfetamine, and methylphenidate have increasingly been used as the treatment of choice (<LINK REF="REF-Coghill-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Coghill 2004</LINK>), but remain controversial (<LINK REF="REF-Timini-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Timini 2003</LINK>). More recently, the first licensed drug treatment claimed by the manufacturer to be a non-stimulant was atomoxetine.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2008-11-08 18:08:03 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Survey research has demonstrated that a significant proportion of children diagnosed with ADHD will receive some form of non-standard treatment or intervention; for example data from Canada indicated that although the majority of a sample questioned were using medication for ADHD symptoms, around 50% were also using a non-standard treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Johnston-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnston 2005</LINK>). Australian surveys have reported between 66-68% of children with ADHD have also been given non-standard therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Sinha-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sinha 2005</LINK>). Reasons for seeking alternative treatments include minimising symptoms of ADHD, additional benefit when combined with conventional treatment and potentially avoiding side effects of prescribed medication (<LINK REF="REF-Sinha-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sinha 2005</LINK>). Non-standard therapy or intervention covers a wide range of alternatives from dietary changes, physical therapies such as chiropractic, herbal medication and homeopathy (<LINK REF="REF-Brue-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brue 2002</LINK>). Data on the current use of homeopathy for ADHD are limited. A survey from Florida, USA, found that around 3% of children diagnosed with ADHD in a school-sample were using or had used homeopathy (<LINK REF="REF-Bussing-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bussing 2002</LINK>) while a study in Australia reported that of 67.6% of diagnosed children using non-standard therapy, 6% had tried homeopathy (<LINK REF="REF-Sinha-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sinha 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<B>Homeopathy </B>
<BR/>In recent years, homeopathy has gained general prominence as an alternative form of treatment. The therapeutic system originated 200 years ago with the German physician and pharmacologist Samuel Hahnemann (1755-1843). As systematised by him, it has numerous features to distinguish it from botanical and conventional approaches to diagnosis and treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Hahnemann-1913" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hahnemann 1913</LINK>). Its fundamental principle is treatment of 'like with like': any natural or man-made substance capable of causing specific disease states and symptoms in healthy individuals may be used to treat the same symptoms when they occur as part of sickness. During homeopathic diagnosis, the symptoms of each patient are considered primarily as an expression of a unique personal illness, as well as evidence that the patient can be assigned to a conventional disease category. Qualitative aspects of the patient's experience of illness (for instance, emotions such as 'feeling forsaken' or symptom modalities such as 'restlessness increased after 1800 hours') are of particular relevance in determining treatment. Concomitant symptoms and co-morbid conditions are also included in the analysis as part of a 'symptom complex'. In homeopathic treatment therefore, there are no uniform medicines to be given for particular conditions; the medicine for each patient is chosen based on their symptom picture and unique characteristics which are then matched with a suitable medicine. Homeopathic pharmacy involves a unique process in which the source material is serially diluted, with violent succussion at each stage. Called 'dynamization' or 'potentization', the process may be repeated many times until no molecules of the starting substance theoretically remain. During treatment, medicines, dilution, dosage and repetition may be changed in response to changes in the patient's condition.</P>
<P>Different homeopathic approaches have been tested in clinical trials, and categorized as 'classical', 'clinical', 'complex' and 'isopathic' subtypes (<LINK REF="REF-Linde-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Linde 1997</LINK>). Classical homeopathy is the complex intervention described above, involving an in-depth consultation and individualized analysis (<LINK REF="REF-Chapman-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chapman 1999</LINK>). Clinical homeopathy is not holistic treatment, but provides a standardized prescription for a predefined condition, based either on traditional recommendations, or new analysis of symptoms (<LINK REF="REF-Clark-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clark 2000</LINK>). Complex homeopathy combines several clinical medicines into a single formula (<LINK REF="REF-Weiser-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weiser 1998</LINK>). Isopathic medicines are prepared from known or presumed aetiological agents (<LINK REF="REF-Taylor-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Taylor 2000</LINK>). Classical homeopathy can potentially include the other modalities, as part of an individualized course of treatment.</P>

<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2008-11-08 18:08:37 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Several global systematic reviews and meta-analyses have examined trials of homeopathy meeting specific criteria, and have found evidence of superiority to placebo (<LINK REF="REF-Linde-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Linde 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cucherat-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cucherat 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Dean-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dean 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kleijnen-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kleijnen 1991</LINK>). A recent meta-regression of placebo-controlled homeopathy trials and randomly selected orthodox trials has claimed that specific effects of homeopathic medicines could be attributed to placebo (<LINK REF="REF-Shang-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shang 2005</LINK>) although there has been considerable debate around the methods of this paper (see <LINK REF="REF-Homeopathy-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Homeopathy 2006</LINK>). A systematic review of adverse effects of homeopathy has reported that it appears to be generally safe, but that adverse effects might be under-reported (<LINK REF="REF-Dantas-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dantas 2000</LINK>).<BR/>To our knowledge no systematic review on the safety and effectiveness of homeopathy for ADHD has been carried out (<LINK REF="REF-Brue-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brue 2002</LINK>), and in view of the increasing numbers of children diagnosed with ADHD receiving non-standard treatments, this review is both relevant and timely.</P>

<P>Two of the four studies included in this review were carried out in the USA - one delivered the homeopathy in a private clinic based in Seattle (<LINK REF="STD-Jacobs-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Jacobs 2005</LINK>), the second conducted the consultation following psychological testing - both performed in the child's foster home or facility (<LINK REF="STD-Lamont-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Lamont 1997</LINK>). The third study was located in South Africa (<LINK REF="STD-Strauss-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Strauss 2000</LINK>) with the final study conducted in Switzerland using a private homeopathic practitioner's office (<LINK REF="STD-Frei-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Frei 2005</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Participants</HEADING>
<P>All of the participants in these studies were children with ages ranging between 7-15 years. All four papers reported that they used children with a diagnosis of ADHD and in two of the studies this diagnosis was re-confirmed either by a psychiatrist or with a battery of diagnostic questionnaires before entry into the trial (<LINK REF="STD-Jacobs-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Jacobs 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Frei-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Frei 2005</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Interventions</HEADING>
<P>All four studies compared active homeopathy with identical placebo homeopathy (a matching sugar pill or solution); three papers used individualised homeopathy (<LINK REF="STD-Frei-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Frei 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jacobs-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Jacobs 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lamont-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Lamont 1997</LINK>) and one used a standardised formula containing various potencies of two medicines (<LINK REF="STD-Strauss-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Strauss 2000</LINK>). The individualised homeopathy was distinctly different in each of the three studies and is detailed in the summaries.<BR/>Homeopaths prescribing in these studies had varying degrees of post-qualification experience ranging from 20 years (<LINK REF="STD-Jacobs-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Jacobs 2005</LINK>) to 4 years (<LINK REF="STD-Lamont-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Lamont 1997</LINK>).<BR/>All studies reported data on at least one of the core aspects of ADHD/HKD as evaluated by the parent or primary carer.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Outcome Measures</HEADING>
<P>Three of the trials used a well-known validated outcome scale designed for assessing ADHD symptoms - the Conners' Ratings Scales. Strauss used an older version (<LINK REF="REF-Conners-1973" TYPE="REFERENCE">Conners 1973</LINK>) while Jacobs and Frei both used the revised forms (CRS-R <LINK REF="REF-Conners-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Conners 2001</LINK>). Frei used the full parent-rating scale in assessment and unblinded follow-up, with the primary outcome measure being the Conners' Global Index-Parent form (CGI-P) which is a ten item summary scale. Jacobs used both the CGI-P and the CRS-R parent forms throughout their study yielding more detailed outcome data.<BR/>The fourth study (<LINK REF="STD-Lamont-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Lamont 1997</LINK>) used an unpublished 5-point rating scale of change in hyperactivity. A study reviewing the impact of using unpublished rating scales to assess outcomes in schizophrenia concluded that use of these measures significantly increases the likelihood of treatment superiority, suggesting that as reviewers we should be cautious about the results (<LINK REF="REF-Marshall-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marshall 2000</LINK>).<BR/>Three trials reported using child-performance tests to assess attention and impulsivity. Jacobs used the Conners' Continuous Performance test (<LINK REF="REF-Conners-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Conners 1995</LINK>), Strauss used a checking task that assessed sustained attention (<LINK REF="REF-CCT-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">CCT 1983</LINK>) and Frei used the Test battery for Attention Performance (<LINK REF="REF-TAP-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">TAP 1992</LINK>) to measure attention and impulsivity.</P>

</B>
<I> </I> (<LINK REF="STD-Frei-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Frei 2005</LINK>)<BR/>This Swiss study included children aged 6-16 years diagnosed with DSM-IV ADHD (mean age of 10 years) recruited from surgeries and support groups. The diagnosis was re-confirmed for entry. The initial consultation took place with parent(s) and child but the 4-weekly follow-ups were carried out with the parents only to minimise psychological support to the children. An initial screening period was used to identify a subset of children which responded to homeopathy. An indefinite number of follow-ups were allowed at this stage and medicines could be prescribed or changed until a successful response was obtained. Participants who successfully responded to homeopathy (50% amelioration of symptoms on Conners' Global Index) were then entered into the randomised cross-over trial. Allocation was based on stratified computer generated randomisation tables. Participants received either: their normal homeopathic medication or a placebo for six weeks in each phase with no further consultations. 83 participants took part in the screening phase and 62 in the trial itself with 31 in each group. The medicines were given in LM liquid potencies as daily drops and prescribing was based on work done previously by the research team including methods from Bönninghausen and a specially developed questionnaire (described in <LINK REF="REF-Frei-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Frei 2006</LINK>). This trial was interested in comparing the extent of maintenance or deterioration of symptoms as assessed by the primary outcome measure: Conners' Global Index - Parent form at entry to the trial, end of cross-over period 1, end of period 2 and after 14 weeks. An extensive battery of neuropsychological tests was also carried out at baseline and following an open-label follow-up period.</P>

<I>Homeopathic treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder: a controlled study</I>
</B> (<LINK REF="STD-Lamont-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Lamont 1997</LINK>)<BR/>This was a quasi-randomised, controlled single-site trial comparing individualised homeopathic medicines with identical placebo pills in children diagnosed with DSM-IV ADHD in California, USA. All participants were recruited when children were referred for psychological testing. All of the children were either in care, foster homes or under the supervision of a social worker. There was a high level of ethnic diversity (35% Black, 47% Hispanic and 18% Caucasian). Following diagnosis by the researcher, a homeopathic consultation was carried out to identify an appropriate individual medicine using classical homeopathic prescribing and the RADAR repertory software (no further details reported). Children were then alternately assigned to verum (n=23) or placebo (n=20) conditions and received their medication by post. Medicines were given as 6 x 200c pills taken daily in both placebo and verum homeopathy arms for up to 5 days. During the trial up to three medicine changes were possible in the verum arm. A partial cross-over design was used where those children initially assigned to placebo were later given verum medicines. The author reports that none of the participants were aware of the use of placebos during the trial as there had been significant problems with compliance in an unpublished pilot study. Follow-up lasted approximately 2 months with 43 children of an average age of 10 years taking part. Symptoms of hyperactivity were measured by an unpublished five-point scale of change in hyperactivity. This scale was administered by telephone 10 days after each homeopathic prescription.</P>

<I>The efficacy of a homeopathic preparation in the management of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder</I>
</B> (<LINK REF="STD-Strauss-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Strauss 2000</LINK>)<BR/>This South African study compared the effects of a commercially available combination homeopathic medicine with identical placebo in children aged 7-10 years reported as having ADHD. Children were classified as medicated (n=10) or not medicated (n=10) on entry to the trial. Participants were recruited via posters at support groups and in doctor's surgeries (<LINK REF="REF-Strauss-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Strauss 2007</LINK>). All the children were aged between 7 and 10 years and had previously received a diagnosis of ADHD from a registered psychiatrist according to legislation in South Africa (<LINK REF="REF-Strauss-2006b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Strauss 2006b</LINK>). The narrow age group included was justified as being the time frame problems were most likely to be presenting to health professionals. There was no clinical consultation as a standard medicine was used, and children were randomly allocated to four groups of five as follows: Arm A (n=5) verum homeopathy + Ritalin, Arm B (n=5) placebo homeopathy + Ritalin, Arm C (n=5) verum homeopathy + no Ritalin, Arm D (n=5) placebo homeopathy + no Ritalin. The study was described only as randomised, personal communication with the author reported that a fellow researcher carried out the randomisation using a computer and then made up the medication (<LINK REF="REF-Strauss-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Strauss 2007</LINK>). The formula containing various potencies of two medicines was taken as daily drops in both placebo and verum conditions for two months. Outcomes were measured at baseline, 30 days and 60 days: an earlier version of the Conners' Rating Scales (<LINK REF="REF-Conners-1973" TYPE="REFERENCE">Conners 1973</LINK>) was used to assess improvements as rated by the parents and a 'cancellation task' (<LINK REF="REF-CCT-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">CCT 1983</LINK>) was used to evaluate sustained attention during the study. Participants took the homeopathic medicine throughout the 60 day trial period and were followed up to termination of the medication.</P>

<I>Homeopathy for attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder: a pilot randomised-controlled trial </I>
</B>(<LINK REF="STD-Jacobs-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Jacobs 2005</LINK>)<BR/>This study was a randomised placebo controlled trial of individualised homeopathy for children diagnosed with ADHD using the DSM-IV. Participants were recruited through advertising and direct mailings to healthcare professionals and psychologists. The computerized Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children was used to ensure children met the DSM-IV criteria for ADHD. An in-depth homeopathic consultation was carried out by one of two privately practicing homeopaths based in Boston, USA, for each child followed by the prescription of a homeopathic medicine. At the point where the prescription was sent to the pharmacy each participant was randomised to receive verum or placebo homeopathy according to a computer generated blocked, stratified number generation algorithm. The prescribing method used in this study is one of the newer approaches and termed the 'Bombay' or 'Sankaran' method (<LINK REF="REF-Jacobs-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jacobs 2006</LINK>). The medicines were prescribed without restrictions and with the freedom to vary the potency and frequency at the follow-up visits on 6 and 12 weeks. The placebo homeopathy followed the same structure and neither homeopath nor patient was aware of the treatment allocation. 43 children with a mean age of 9 years took part in the study, 21 in the verum group and 22 in the placebo group. ADHD symptoms at 18 weeks were measured by validated rating scales completed by parents and teachers (Conners' Revised Rating Scales <LINK REF="REF-Conners-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Conners 2001</LINK>) and computer tasks that assessed attention and impulsivity (<LINK REF="REF-Conners-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Conners 1995</LINK>).</P>

<I>Sequence generation and allocation concealment</I>
</B>
<BR/>Of the four studies included in this review, two of the randomised controlled trials reported details of both the sequence generation (computer generated stratified randomisation) and concealment of randomisation in sufficient depth in the published papers to merit a positive judgement for these categories (<LINK REF="STD-Jacobs-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Jacobs 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Frei-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Frei 2005</LINK>). This substantially reduces the likelihood of bias or subversion in these trials. The third randomised controlled trial (<LINK REF="STD-Strauss-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Strauss 2000</LINK>) merely described the allocation process as random with no further details in the published paper but following correspondence was judged to be sufficient because the computerised random allocation was performed by a colleague (<LINK REF="REF-Strauss-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Strauss 2007</LINK>). The final study (<LINK REF="STD-Lamont-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Lamont 1997</LINK>) was quasi-randomised, alternation being performed by the clinician who was also the researcher and performed the analysis, making the study potentially more susceptible to bias.</P>

<P>This section reports the results for each of the outcomes of interest identified in the Methods section. Effect sizes and 95% confidence intervals have been calculated where possible and unless otherwise noted a minus sign favours the active homeopathic intervention rather than the placebo control. Final post-intervention values were used in preference to change scores as advised by the CDPLP Group. Fixed and random effects models were both checked but fixed effects models were sufficient for most analyses given the lack of heterogeneity. Effect sizes were calculated as standardised mean differences (SMD) since not all trials had used the same outcome measure or version of a particular ratings scale.

A mean difference in final scores and 95% CI was provided by the authors and the standard error calculated from this. This gave a generic inverse variance weighted average treatment effect. A significant benefit of verum homeopathy over placebo in the cross-over phase of the study was noted [-1.67 (CI -3.32, -0.02)]. This was a cross-over study as noted previously and due to the design of the trial it is possible that there may have been regression to the mean (<LINK REF="REF-Bland-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bland 1994</LINK>) in the first phase, or a carry-over effect (<LINK REF="REF-Elbourne-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elbourne 2002</LINK>) in either phase one or two.

The results showed no evidence of effectiveness of homeopathy on ADHD Index score as rated by parents [SMD -0.17 (CI -1.05, 0.71)].</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">b) Hyperactivity</HEADING>
<P>Jacobs reported data on the Hyperactivity subscale from CPRS-R scored by the parents which showed no evidence of effectiveness of homeopathy on hyperactivity symptoms [SMD 0.21 (CI -0.39, 0.81)].<BR/>Lamont used a five point rating scale completed by parents or carers that evaluated any observed change in hyperactivity in the past 10 days. This produces a change score without a reference baseline. This scale is reported to have been used in a previous pilot study but no information was available on its development or validation. Lamont's study reported results from the first medicine prescription and using these data evidence of effectiveness was found [SMD -0.65 (CI -1.27, -0.03)]. The study design also involved varying the medicine if the original prescription was judged to be ineffective in the verum group. These results were reported as follows: "<I>when more than one homeopathic medicine was given, the improvement score from the best one only was used</I>"(<LINK REF="STD-Lamont-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Lamont 1997</LINK>). Full change scores were not presented for all prescriptions therefore it was unclear which medicine administration the verum improvement scores referred to, therefore these data were not considered for this review.<BR/>A final set of results were also reported based on the partial cross-over design; where those participants receiving placebo were then given verum homeopathy and a within-subject analysis carried out. Again it was unclear which medicine administration the verum improvement scores referred to, therefore these data were not considered for this review.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">c) Inattention</HEADING>
<P>Only one study reported data on inattention, Jacobs used the CPRS-R domain of inattention but no evidence of effectiveness was found [SMD 0.39 (CI -0.21, 1.00)].</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">d) Restless/Impulsivity</HEADING>
<P>Two studies reported restlessness/impulsivity outcome data, Jacobs reported scores from the CPRS-R which found no significant evidence of effectiveness [SMD 0.02 (CI -0.57, 0.62)]. Strauss reported similar data from the CRS and again no evidence of effectiveness was found [SMD -0.14 (CI -1.02, 0.74)].</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">1.3 Related outcomes</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">a) Anxiety</HEADING>
<P>One study reported Anxiety as an outcome based on a domain within the older CRS. Strauss' data showed a non-significant difference in levels of anxiety [SMD -0.55 (CI -1.45, 0.34)].</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">b) Conduct/Oppositional</HEADING>
<P>Jacobs and Strauss both reported data on conduct/oppositional behaviour outcome variable with neither finding evidence of effectiveness: Jacobs [SMD 0.10 (CI -0.50, 0.70)], Strauss [SMD -0.26 (CI -1.14, 0.63)].</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">c) Emotional Lability</HEADING>
<P>This is a domain only included in the newer revised Conners' scales, therefore only Jacobs reported these data and it did not indicate any evidence of effectiveness [SMD 0.21 (CI -0.39, 0.81)].</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">02 - Teacher Ratings</HEADING>
<P>Jacobs was the only study to use teacher based ratings of symptoms and behaviour. All data were collected using the Conners' Global Index-Teacher form (CGI-T) which provides a global total [SMD 0.41 (CI -0.20, 1.01)] and two further sub-domains covering Core Symptoms and Related Outcomes respectively. Restless/Impulsive [SMD 0.39 (CI -0.21, 1.00)] and Emotional Lability [SMD 0.41 (CI -0.19, 1.02)]. No significant differences were recorded in any of these three teacher-rated variables.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">03 - Child Ratings</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">a) Inattention</HEADING>
<P>Frei assessed inattention using the Test battery for Attention Performance (<LINK REF="REF-TAP-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">TAP 1992</LINK>) but did not provide sufficient data to allow the calculation of an effect size.<BR/>Jacobs and Strauss both used child-completed tasks to assess levels of attention in the participants. Jacobs used the Conners' Continuous Performance Test (<LINK REF="REF-Conners-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Conners 1995</LINK>). The CPT is a computer program that flashes up successive letter stimuli, respondents are required to press the space bar or click the mouse whenever any letter except the letter 'X' appears on the computer screen. The number of omission errors (missed targets) were then taken as a measure of inattention. No significant difference was recorded for this outcome by Jacobs [SMD -0.12 (CI -0.72, 0.48)].<BR/>Strauss used a pencil and paper task described as the Childrens' Checking Task (<LINK REF="REF-CCT-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">CCT 1983</LINK>). In the CCT, the child is presented with a block of characters (letters/symbols/numbers) and asked to score through a target whenever it appears in the block. The original paper presented the results as percentage correctly identified. Using data provided by the author, MH converted the percentages into raw scores and then multiplied these by -1 to provide a measure of inattention rather than successful attention. Having carried out this conversion there was no significant difference [SMD -0.53 (CI -1.42, 0.37)].</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">b) Impulsivity</HEADING>
<P>Based on the Continuous Performance Test described above and used by Jacobs, the number of commission errors (false alarms) can be used to reflect levels of impulsivity. No evidence of effectiveness was found [SMD -0.07 (CI -0.67, 0.53)].<BR/>Frei assessed impulsivity using the Test battery for Attention Performance (TAP) but did not provide sufficient data to allow the calculation of an effect size.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Section B: Meta-analysis</HEADING>
<P>This section details the meta-analysis of data for global scores and core outcomes as rated by parents and evaluated by child-completed tasks where there were sufficient data reported by the included papers.<BR/>We have not analysed by type of homeopathy due to the lack of studies available- most of the pooling possible was between Strauss (formula approach) and Jacobs (individualised homeopathy). While we acknowledge the substantial differences in treatment approach (as detailed in the description of included studies section) it was felt by the reviewers that pooling was still appropriate since overall all of the included studies could be interpreted as addressing the ongoing controversy of whether homeopathic dilutions have any efficacy over a placebo dose.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">01 - Parent Ratings</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">1.1 Global ratings</HEADING>
<P>A generic inverse-variance analysis was carried out to pool the results from two trials of individualised homeopathy versus placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Jacobs-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Jacobs 2005</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Frei-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Frei 2005</LINK>) based on the data available from the studies. Both studies used the same outcome measure - parent rated Conners' Global Index scores - providing data from a total of 105 participants. In the analysis <LINK REF="STD-Frei-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Frei 2005</LINK> was given substantially more weighting than <LINK REF="STD-Jacobs-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Jacobs 2005</LINK> as a result of having a larger sample and less variance around the estimate. The combined data show no evidence of the effectiveness of homeopathy over placebo in improving CGI scores for children with ADHD [average treatment effect -1.56 (CI -3.18, 0.06)].</P>

A sensitivity analysis of <LINK REF="STD-Jacobs-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Jacobs 2005</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Lamont-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Lamont 1997</LINK> using final values and first prescription data only found no evidence of the effectiveness of homeopathy in improving hyperactivity in children with ADHD [SMD -0.22 (CI -1.06, 0.23)].

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2008-11-08 18:25:35 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Four studies were included in this review, and three in the meta-analyses, reporting research conducted over a ten-year period. Overall this review found no evidence that homeopathy has a significant impact on the overall severity, core symptoms or related outcomes of children diagnosed with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder.</P>
<P>Three of these studies looked at the overall change in symptoms during homeopathic treatment while a fourth examined the maintenance or deterioration of previously achieved improvement. While varying forms of homeopathy were used in each trial, results were pooled where possible to address the common question about what effects, if any, can be observed as a result of using ultra-low dosages as has been done in other reviews (e.g. <LINK REF="REF-Linde-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Linde 1997</LINK>). Three studies used individualised homeopathy as the treatment model although they drew on different prescribing strategies and sources while one used a standard formula prescription.</P>
<P>Focusing on the three trials included in the meta-analysis: significant heterogeneity exists between these trials in terms of how the 'homeopathic treatment' was operationalised and implemented, as well as the effects. <LINK REF="STD-Strauss-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Strauss 2000</LINK> used a formula of medicines given without individualisation to patients over a relatively short period of time, and analysis of the raw data did not indicate a beneficial effect over placebo. <LINK REF="STD-Jacobs-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Jacobs 2005</LINK> used a form of individualised homeopathy similar to how 'classical' homeopathy is used in practice with freedom to vary the medicines as well as potency (strength) and frequency, although critics have suggested that the treatment period of 18 weeks was too short to show benefit from homeopathy hence the negative findings. A previous observational study, using a different treatment protocol, found that around 6 months was required to identify the correct medicine and see a change in symptoms (<LINK REF="STD-Frei-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Frei 2001</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Frei-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Frei 2005</LINK> used a treatment protocol based on that observational study (<LINK REF="STD-Frei-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Frei 2001</LINK>) where medicine identification was not carried out under a time limit. The subsequent cross-over placebo comparison phase showed a small but statistically significant benefit from homeopathic treatment when core symptoms were rated by parents. Interestingly this study differed from Jacobs in that children were only seen once by the homeopath and all follow-ups carried out with the parents by telephone. The authors stated intention was to reduce the non-specific effects of homeopathy and test the impact of the medicine itself as far as possible.<BR/>Overall therefore, a trial of formula homeopathy found no difference between placebo and verum (<LINK REF="STD-Strauss-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Strauss 2000</LINK>), a trial of classical individualised homeopathy that more closely mirrored usual practice found no significant difference between verum and placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Jacobs-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Jacobs 2005</LINK>) and a trial of individualised homeopathy with minimised non-specific effects found a significant benefit from homeopathy (<LINK REF="STD-Frei-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Frei 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>There was a lack of data collected regarding safety issues and this should be addressed in any future trials of homeopathy generally as well as in this particular area.</P>
<P>There was a lack of data collection from the children/young people themselves in these trials, none of which used child-centred outcome measures or sought their opinions on the impact of the treatments. Given the available research on the importance of including children's perspectives and opinions within their healthcare, and the ability of even young children to report on their health status and quality of life, these issues should be addressed in any future research (e.g. <LINK REF="REF-Eiser-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eiser 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rebok-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rebok 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wallander-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wallander 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>There is insufficient evidence to draw robust conclusions about the effectiveness of any particular form of homeopathy for ADHD at present given that only three randomised controlled trials have been carried out, and all were relatively small in size. When pooled, results do not indicate a significant benefit of homeopathy, but due to the heterogeneity between homeopathic interventions being tested there may be scope for more targeted research to test different treatment protocols.<BR/>There are a number of factors that could be taken into account in future trials. Good quality observational studies documenting how homeopaths in the country of an intended trial actually practice, including time to see benefit and adverse events or side effects, are crucial for the development of good quality trials (<LINK REF="REF-McCarney-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">McCarney 2004</LINK>). Future trials should ideally take this information into account in the design phase, while recognising that homeopathy, particularly individualised homeopathy, is a package of care which potentially contains multiple active ingredients (<LINK REF="REF-Thompson-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thompson 2006</LINK>). The latter point relates to an ongoing debate as to the suitability of the placebo-controlled trial for testing homeopathy, which is exacerbated when ethics committees refuse to permit a wait-list condition (e.g. <LINK REF="STD-Jacobs-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Jacobs 2005</LINK>) to explore the non-specific effects.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>There is at present insufficient evidence to recommend the use of homeopathy for children diagnosed with ADHD.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>This review has highlighted that should further research be carried out, optimal detailed treatment protocols are required and should be developed to reflect current practice. We plan to update this review within 24 months to incorporate any new studies and/or respond to comments or criticisms.</P>

<P>Individualised homeopathic medicines were prescribed in the screening phase (n=83) as daily liquid doses (LM potencies). <BR/>Medicines were prescribed according to Hahnemann and Bönninghausen. Children were seen only once by the homeopathic physician with treatment progress assessed by the parents at 4-weekly intervals and medicine adjusted as necessary. <BR/> In the trial phase participants received either the successful remedy (n=31) or an identical placebo (n=31) to be taken daily for 6 weeks followed by cross-over. No contact with the homeopathic physician occurred during the cross-over trial phase.</P>

<P>Screening stage: CRS-R Parent and Teacher forms, Kinsbourne Attention Questionnaire<BR/>Baseline of trial: Conners Global Index-Parent form, Questionnaire of Change of Behaviour (QCB), VLMT (auditory learning test), sub-tests of WISC (Wechsler intelligence test), K-ABC Kaufman Assessment Battery for Children, TAP Test Assessment battery for Attention Performance.<BR/>Final outcomes: CGI-Parent, VLMT, QCB, WISC</P>
</CHAR_OUTCOMES>
<CHAR_NOTES>
<P>This trial aimed to identify children who successfully responded to homeopathy by demonstrating at least a 50% reduction in their ADHD symptoms. From previous research it was assumed that this gain would only be maintained while the child continued to take the remedy allowing a placebo-controlled comparison where the outcome of interest was deterioration in symptoms under placebo compared to maintenance of improvement under verum or real homeopathy.</P>

</CHAR_PARTICIPANTS>
<CHAR_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>Individualised homeopathic medicines were prescribed for each child following a consultation using classical homeopathic prescribing and the RADAR repertory software. Medicines were given as 6 x 200c pills daily for up to 5 days. Progress was followed-up 10 days after the prescription with the option of changing the medicine on two further occasions.<BR/>The placebo group received an indistinguishable placebo pill on one occasion but later on were crossed-over to receive verum homeopathy as described above.<BR/>The only contact between child and homeopathic physician was at the first consultation. Follow-up was carried out by phone with parents or carers.</P>
</CHAR_INTERVENTIONS>
<CHAR_OUTCOMES>
<P>Outcomes were reported by parent/carer to the researcher by telephone 10 days after each prescription using an un validated five-point rating scale of "change in hyperactivity" which spanned -2 'much worse' to 0 'no change' to +2 'much better'.
