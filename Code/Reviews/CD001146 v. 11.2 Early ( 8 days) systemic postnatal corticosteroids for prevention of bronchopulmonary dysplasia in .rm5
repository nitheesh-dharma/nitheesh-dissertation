Bronchopulmonary dysplasia is a major problem for newborn babies in neonatal intensive care units. Persistent inflammation of the lungs is the most likely cause. Corticosteroid drugs have been used to prevent or treat bronchopulmonary dysplasia through their strong anti-inflammatory effects.</P><P><B>Study characteristics: </B>We reviewed all clinical trials in preterm babies in which corticosteroids had been given as a medication during the first week after birth, and from which data on the rate of bronchopulmonary dysplasia later in the newborn period were available.</P><P><B>Key results:</B> This review of trials revealed that the benefits of giving systemic corticosteroids to infants starting up to seven days after birth may not outweigh the known adverse effects. However, a particular corticosteroid called hydrocortisone shows promise in improving short-term outcomes without adversely affecting long-term neurodevelopment. Beneficial effects of systemic corticosteroids overall included shorter time on the ventilator and less bronchopulmonary dysplasia, but adverse effects included higher blood pressure, bleeding from the stomach or bowel, perforation of the bowel, excessive glucose in the bloodstream, and increased risk of cerebral palsy at follow-up, particularly in those treated with dexamethasone - another type of corticosteroid.

The overall risk of bias of included studies was probably low, as all were RCTs, and most trials used rigorous methods. Investigators reported significant benefits for the following outcomes overall: lower rates of failure to extubate, decreased risks of bronchopulmonary dysplasia both at 28 days of life and at 36 weeks' postmenstrual age, death or bronchopulmonary dysplasia at 28 days of life and at 36 weeks' postmenstrual age, patent ductus arteriosus, and retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), including severe ROP. Researchers found no significant differences in rates of neonatal or subsequent mortality; they noted that gastrointestinal bleeding and intestinal perforation were important adverse effects, and that risks of hyperglycaemia, hypertension, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and growth failure were increased. The 13 trials that reported late outcomes described several adverse neurological effects at follow-up examination, including cerebral palsy. However, study authors indicated that major neurosensory disability was not significantly increased, either overall in the eight studies for which this outcome could be determined, or in the two individual studies in which rates of cerebral palsy or abnormal neurological examination were significantly increased. Moreover, data show that rates of the combined outcomes of death or cerebral palsy, or of death or major neurosensory disability, were not significantly increased. Two-thirds of studies used dexamethasone (n = 21). Subgroup analyses by type of corticosteroid revealed that most of the beneficial and harmful effects of treatment were attributable to dexamethasone. However, as with dexamethasone, hydrocortisone was associated with reduced rates of patent ductus arteriosus, mortality, and the combined outcome of mortality or chronic lung disease, but with increased occurrence of intestinal perforation. Results showed that hydrocortisone was not associated with obvious longer-term problems.</P><P>Use of the GRADE approach revealed that the quality of evidence was high for the major outcomes considered, but review authors downgraded quality one level for several outcomes (mortality at latest age, bronchopulmonary dysplasia at 36 weeks, and death or bronchopulmonary dysplasia at 36 weeks) because of weak evidence of publication bias or moderate heterogeneity (death or cerebral palsy).</P></ABS_RESULTS><ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2017-10-12 08:57:38 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Benefits of early postnatal corticosteroid treatment (&#8804; 7 days), particularly dexamethasone, may not outweigh adverse effects associated with this treatment. Although early corticosteroid treatment facilitates extubation and reduces risk of bronchopulmonary dysplasia and patent ductus arteriosus, it causes short-term adverse effects including gastrointestinal bleeding, intestinal perforation, hyperglycaemia, hypertension, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and growth failure. Long-term follow-up studies report increased risk of abnormal findings on neurological examination and increased risk of cerebral palsy. However, the methodological quality of studies examining long-term outcomes is limited in some cases: Surviving children have been assessed predominantly before school age; no study has been sufficiently powered to detect important adverse long-term neurosensory outcomes; and no study has been designed with survival free of adverse long-term neurodevelopmental disability as the primary outcome. There is a compelling need for long-term follow-up and reporting of late outcomes, especially neurological and developmental outcomes, among surviving infants who participated in all randomised trials of early postnatal corticosteroid treatment. Hydrocortisone reduced rates of patent ductus arteriosus, of mortality, and of the combined outcome of mortality or bronchopulmonary dysplasia, without causing any obvious long-term harm. However, gastrointestinal perforation was more frequent in the hydrocortisone group. Longer-term follow-up into late childhood is vital for assessment of important effects or other effects that cannot be assessed in early childhood, such as effects of early hydrocortisone treatment on higher-order neurological functions, including cognitive function, academic performance, behaviour, mental health, and motor function. Further randomised controlled trials of early hydrocortisone should include longer-term survival free of neurodevelopmental disability as the main outcome.</P></ABS_CONCLUSIONS></ABSTRACT><BODY MODIFIED="2017-10-23 09:21:14 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2017-10-19 12:48:48 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><CONDITION MODIFIED="2017-10-12 09:02:33 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Advances in neonatal care, including use of antenatal corticosteroids and surfactant therapy, have improved the outcomes of preterm infants with respiratory distress syndrome, but risk of chronic lung disease or bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) has been only modestly reduced (<LINK REF="REF-Egberts-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Egberts 1997</LINK>). The terms 'chronic lung disease' and 'bronchopulmonary dysplasia' are often used interchangeably; for the purposes of this review, we have decided to use 'bronchopulmonary dysplasia' to describe the condition of infants with oxygen dependency at 28 days of life or at 36 weeks' postmenstrual age. More infants with BPD are now cared for in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs), and management of their condition is both time-consuming and costly. Bronchopulmonary dysplasia refers to injury and maldevelopment of the lung that follows preterm birth and is a major problem in NICUs. Persistent inflammation in the lungs is the most likely underlying pathogenesis.</P></CONDITION><INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2017-10-12 09:03:59 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Postnatal corticosteroid treatment has been shown to have some beneficial acute effects on lung function in infants with established BPD, especially among those who are ventilator-dependent (<LINK REF="STD-CDTG-1991" TYPE="STUDY">CDTG 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mammel-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mammel 1983</LINK>).

Study authors reported short-term outcome data for all 262 enrolled infants and described the study as double-blind. Follow-up consisted of the following: In 1998, researchers reported that one neurologist and one psychologist saw survivors at a mean age of 25 months, corrected for prematurity, with observers blinded to treatment group allocation (<LINK REF="REF-Yeh-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yeh 1998</LINK>). The follow-up rate of survivors was 81% (133/164). Study authors did not specify criteria for the diagnosis of cerebral palsy, blindness, or deafness. Psychological assessment included the MDI and the PDI of the Bayley Scales of Infant Development. Major neurosensory disability comprised severe motor dysfunction (child non-ambulant) or an MDI or PDI &lt; -2 SD. In 2004, investigators in the Yeh trial reported that trial personnel reassessed survivors at seven to nine years of age (<LINK REF="REF-Yeh-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yeh 2004</LINK>). The follow-up rate of survivors was 92% (146/159). Assessors were blind to treatment allocation. A paediatric neurologist evaluated children for cerebral palsy, assessing motor skills using the Movement ABC, and IQ using the WISC-III. Trial personnel formally evaluated vision and hearing. Major neurological disability comprised any of cerebral palsy, vision worse than 20/60, deafness requiring hearing aids, or an IQ &lt; 5th centile. Whether age was corrected for prematurity remained unclear. We used data for cerebral palsy at eight years in the meta-analysis, as the diagnosis of cerebral palsy is more certain at eight years than at two years of age, and because the follow-up rate was higher when participants were eight years of age. Trialists measured blood pressure, height, weight, and head circumference at eight years of age but did not report these as standardised scores (SD or Z-scores), to enable pooling of data for meta-analysis.</P></STUDY_QUALITY><INTERVENTION_EFFECTS MODIFIED="2017-10-19 11:00:43 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="3">Results of meta-analysis</HEADING><P>Meta-analysis of these 32 studies of early postnatal corticosteroid treatment yielded the following results.</P><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="4">Mortality</HEADING><P>No evidence suggests that early postnatal corticosteroid treatment reduced mortality at 28 days of life (typical risk ratio (RR) 1.02, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.88 to 1.19, 19 studies, 2950 infants; <LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>), at 36 weeks' gestational age (OR 1.01, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.14, 20 studies, 3733 infants; <LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>), before discharge (typical RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.07, 30 studies, 4273 infants; <LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>), or at the latest age possible to determine the outcome (typical RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.06, 31 studies, 4373 infants; <LINK REF="CMP-001.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.4</LINK>).

During treatment, rates of hyponatraemia, hypernatraemia, hyperkalaemia, hyperglycaemia, hypertension, and gastrointestinal bleeding were similar between groups. Seventy-four infants (41%) in the hydrocortisone group and 62 (34%) in the placebo group were treated with insulin (P = 0.19).

It has been suggested that corticosteroids might have a role to play in prevention of BPD by suppressing the inflammatory response in the lungs of infants at risk (<LINK REF="REF-Groneck-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Groneck 1995</LINK>). It has been shown that infants who develop BPD have low cortisol levels following adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) stimulation during the first week of life (<LINK REF="STD-Watterberg-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Watterberg 1999</LINK>). To be effective in preventing BPD, corticosteroids may have to be given within the first few days of life.</P><P>This review has demonstrated that early corticosteroid treatment facilitates weaning from the ventilator. Additional advantages include increased survival without BPD at 28 days of life and at 36 weeks' postmenstrual age, reduced risks of BPD at 28 days of life and at 36 weeks' postmenstrual age, and reduced risks of late treatment with corticosteroids, patent ductus arteriosus, and retinopathy of prematurity. On the other hand, risks of gastrointestinal bleeding, intestinal perforation, hyperglycaemia, hypertension, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and growth failure may be increased.</P><P>Potential hazards of corticosteroid treatment for the neonate include growth restriction, protein breakdown, cardiac hypertrophy, and possible adverse effects on development of the central nervous system and lungs (<LINK REF="REF-Gibson-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gibson 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gramsbergen-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gramsbergen 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tschanz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tschanz 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-van-Goudoever-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Goudoever 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Weichsel-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weichsel 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Werner-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Werner 1992</LINK>). One study showed a significant decline in the growth of head circumference with early corticosteroid treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Papile-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Papile 1996</LINK>). Long-term follow-up results showed that early corticosteroid treatment is associated with a significant increase in risks of developmental delay and cerebral palsy, but has no significant effects on the combined outcome of death or cerebral palsy, except in the subgroup of infants treated with dexamethasone. One study in which the rate of cerebral palsy was significantly higher at two years of age used a four-week tapering course of dexamethasone, so is similar in duration to the six-week tapering course of late corticosteroids reported by Kothaia and included in the systematic review of late corticosteroids (<LINK REF="REF-Doyle-2014a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Doyle 2014a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kothadia-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Kothadia 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yeh-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Yeh 1997</LINK>). However, in <LINK REF="STD-Yeh-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Yeh 1997</LINK>, the numbers of surviving children with cerebral palsy declined between two and eight to nine years of age, and the difference became statistically non-significant. In the 2002 follow-up study to the 1996 Shinwell study, adverse long-term neurological outcomes were reported in children treated with only a three-day course of early dexamethasone starting within 12 hours of birth (<LINK REF="STD-Shinwell-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Shinwell 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shinwell-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shinwell 2002</LINK>). This finding is of extreme importance and concern, as data show about a three-fold increased risk of cerebral palsy among survivors, including children with spastic diplegia, spastic quadriplegia, and hemiplegia. Why dexamethasone given early for a short course should have such devastating effects remains unknown. Certainly some infants would have been treated with repeat courses of dexamethasone, but this would have been more likely among control infants. Periventricular leukomalacia is an obvious cause of cerebral palsy, but studies have shown no excess of this disorder in corticosteroid-treated infants compared with controls. Despite an increase in the diagnosis of cerebral palsy, it is important to note that this does not necessarily translate into major functional disability for the children concerned.</P><P>This systematic review found that early (&#8804; 7 days) systemic postnatal corticosteroids for preventing BPD in preterm infants, in the regimens used, have had significant short-term and long-term effects - both beneficial and harmful. A significant problem in interpreting late follow-up data is that only 13 of 32 trials of early postnatal corticosteroids have reported follow-up results; therefore, the possibility of follow-up bias and publication bias must be considered. Potential limitations of the study with a significant increase in the rate of cerebral palsy are that only 84% of surviving infants were examined, and children were assessed during early childhood (<LINK REF="STD-Shinwell-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Shinwell 1996</LINK>). It is important to remember that cerebral palsy had been diagnosed before the children were five years of age in most cases; diagnosing cerebral palsy with certainty before five years of age is problematic (<LINK REF="REF-Stanley-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stanley 1982</LINK>). In another study, in which the rate of cerebral palsy was significantly worse at two years of age, with 81% follow-up, the difference became non-significant at eight to nine years - an age when the diagnosis of cerebral palsy is more certain, and when the follow-up rate was much better (92%), illustrating the importance of age of assessment and high follow-up rates (<LINK REF="STD-Yeh-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Yeh 1997</LINK>). No study was designed primarily to test effects of postnatal corticosteroids on adverse long-term neurosensory outcomes, and all studies were underpowered to detect clinically important differences in long-term neurosensory outcomes.</P><P>Subgroup analyses by type of corticosteroid revealed that most beneficial and harmful effects were attributable to dexamethasone, and that hydrocortisone had little effect in most analyses, but the power to detect beneficial or harmful effects of hydrocortisone was low for most comparisons. However, the addition of data from the latest randomised controlled trial of early hydrocortisone reported by Baud and colleagues, which is also the largest trial, has revealed some advantages for early hydrocortisone in improving rates of mortality, extubation failure, and patent ductus arteriosus (<LINK REF="STD-Baud-2016" TYPE="STUDY">Baud 2016</LINK>).</P><P>In an observational study of infants born after antenatal corticosteroid therapy, an excess of periventricular leukomalacia was evident among those whose mothers had received dexamethasone rather than betamethasone (<LINK REF="REF-Baud-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baud 1999</LINK>). Most studies of postnatal corticosteroids used dexamethasone in high doses of 0.5 to 1.0 mg/kg/d. Other corticosteroids or lower doses of dexamethasone may prove to be safer, and emerging evidence supports the use of hydrocortisone as prophylaxis for bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Further studies are needed to compare lower doses of corticosteroids, other corticosteroids, and alternative routes of administration (e.g. inhalation) (see Cochrane Review - <LINK REF="REF-Shah-2017" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shah 2017</LINK>).</P><QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2017-10-11 22:29:08 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Review authors assessed the quality of evidence for seven major outcomes (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>).

Early postnatal corticosteroid treatment resulted in short-term benefits, including earlier extubation and decreased risks of bronchopulmonary dysplasia and of 'death or bronchopulmonary dysplasia' at 28 days of life and at 36 weeks' postmenstrual age, but was also associated with significant short-term and long-term adverse effects. Adverse effects included short-term risk of gastrointestinal bleeding, intestinal perforation, hyperglycaemia, and hypertension, as well as long-term risks of abnormal neurological examination findings and cerebral palsy. However, the methodological quality of studies determining long-term outcomes was limited in some cases; children were assessed predominantly before school age, and no study was sufficiently powered to detect important adverse long-term neurosensory outcomes. Therefore, given the risks of potential short-term and long-term adverse effects versus potential short-term benefits, it appears appropriate to curtail early corticosteroid treatment for prevention of bronchopulmonary dysplasia.</P></IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE><IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2017-10-11 22:33:28 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Through this systematic review, we have identified a compelling need for long-term follow-up and reporting of late outcomes, especially neurological and developmental outcomes, among surviving infants who participated in all randomised trials of early postnatal corticosteroid treatment.

We searched MEDLINE using the terms: adrenal cortex hormones or dexamethasone or betamethasone or hydrocortisone or steroids or corticosteroids, limits randomised controlled trials, human, all infant: birth to 23 months.

For each trial, we sought information regarding the method of randomisation, and of blinding and reporting of all outcomes for all infants enrolled in the trial. We assessed each criterion as having low, high, or unclear risk. Two review authors separately assessed each study. We resolved disagreements by discussion. We added this information to the table 'Characteristics of included studies'. We evaluated the following issues and entered findings into the 'Risk of bias' table.</P><P>1. Sequence generation (checking for possible selection bias). Was the allocation sequence adequately generated?</P><P>For each included study, we categorised the method used to generate the allocation sequence as:</P><P>a. low risk (any truly random process e.g. random number table; computer random number generator);</P><P>b. high risk (any non-random process e.g. odd or even date of birth; hospital or clinic record number); or</P><P>c. unclear risk.</P><P>2. Allocation concealment (checking for possible selection bias). Was allocation adequately concealed?</P><P>For each included study, we categorised the method used to conceal the allocation sequence as:</P><P>a. low risk (e.g. telephone or central randomisation; consecutively numbered sealed opaque envelopes);</P><P>b. high risk (open random allocation; unsealed or non-opaque envelopes, alternation; date of birth); or</P><P>c. unclear risk.</P><P>3. Blinding of participants and personnel (checking for possible performance bias). Was knowledge of the allocated intervention adequately prevented during the study?</P><P>For each included study, we categorised the methods used to blind study participants and personnel from knowledge of which intervention a participant received. We assessed blinding separately for different outcomes or classes of outcomes. We categorised methods as:</P><P>a. low risk, high risk, or unclear risk for participants; and</P><P>b. low risk, high risk, or unclear risk for personnel;</P><P>4. Blinding of outcome assessment (checking for possible detection bias). Was knowledge of the allocated intervention adequately prevented at the time of outcome assessment?</P><P>For each included study, we categorised the methods used to blind outcome assessment. We assessed blinding separately for different outcomes or classes of outcomes. We categorised the methods as:</P><P>a. low risk for outcome assessors;</P><P>b. high risk for outcome assessors; or</P><P>c. unclear risk for outcome assessors.</P><P>5. Incomplete outcome data (checking for possible attrition bias through withdrawals, dropouts, protocol deviations). Were incomplete outcome data adequately addressed?</P><P>For each included study and for each outcome, we described the completeness of data including attrition and exclusions from the analysis. We noted whether attrition and exclusions were reported, numbers included in the analysis at each stage (compared with total randomised participants), reasons for attrition or exclusion when reported, and whether missing data were balanced across groups or were related to outcomes. When trial authors reported or supplied sufficient information, we re-included missing data in the analyses. We categorised methods as:</P><P>a. low risk (&lt; 20% missing data);</P><P>b. high risk (&#8805; 20% missing data); or</P><P>c. unclear risk.</P><P>6. Selective reporting bias. Are reports of the study free of suggestion of selective outcome reporting?</P><P>For each included study, we described how we investigated the possibility of selective outcome reporting bias and what we found. We assessed the methods as:</P><P>a. low risk (when it is clear that all of the study's prespecified outcomes and all expected outcomes of interest to the review have been reported);</P><P>b. high risk (when not all of the study's prespecified outcomes have been reported; one or more reported primary outcomes were not prespecified outcomes of interest and are reported incompletely and so cannot be used; study fails to include results of a key outcome that would have been expected to have been reported); or</P><P>c. unclear risk.</P><P>7. Other sources of bias. Was the study apparently free of other problems that could put it at high risk of bias?</P><P>For each included study, we described any important concerns we had about other possible sources of bias (e.g. whether there was a potential source of bias related to the specific study design, whether the trial was stopped early owing to some data-dependent process). We assessed whether each study was free of other problems that could put it at risk of bias as:</P><P>a. low risk;</P><P>b. high risk; or</P><P>c. unclear risk</P><P>If needed, we explored the impact of the level of bias by undertaking sensitivity analyses.</P></APPENDIX_BODY></APPENDIX></APPENDICES><EXTENSIONS MODIFIED="2008-08-20 07:36:17 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><EXTENSION ID="FLOW_1" NAME="FIGURE" REVMAN_VERSION="5.1.0" TYPE="FLOWCHART"><ALIAS ALIAS_ID="1"><FLOWCHARTBOX TEXT="&lt;p&gt;32 studies included in quantitative synthesis (meta-analysis)&lt;/p&gt;" WIDTH="120"><FLOWCHARTBOX TEXT="&lt;p&gt;32 studies included in qualitative synthesis&lt;/p&gt;" WIDTH="125"><FLOWCHARTBOX TEXT="&lt;p&gt;29 studies included in previous version of review&lt;/p&gt;"/><FLOWCHARTBOX TEXT="&lt;p&gt;Three NEW studies included&lt;/p&gt;" WIDTH="120"><FLOWCHARTBOX TEXT="&lt;p&gt;14 full-text articles assessed for eligibility&lt;/p&gt;" WIDTH="120"><FLOWCHARTBOX TEXT="&lt;p&gt;4180 records screened&lt;/p&gt;" WIDTH="120"><FLOWCHARTBOX TEXT="&lt;p&gt;4180 records after duplicates removed&lt;/p&gt;"><FLOWCHARTBOX TEXT="&lt;p&gt;4930 records identified through database searching (2013-2017)&lt;/p&gt;" WIDTH="120"/><FLOWCHARTBOX TEXT="&lt;p&gt;102 additional records identified through other sources&lt;/p&gt;" WIDTH="120"/></FLOWCHARTBOX><OUT TEXT="&lt;p&gt;4166 records excluded&lt;/p&gt;" WIDTH="120"/></FLOWCHARTBOX><OUT TEXT="&lt;p&gt;11 full-text articles excluded, mostly because they were not randomised controlled trials; others because they did not recruit relevant infants or report relevant outcomes&lt;/p&gt;" WIDTH="120"/></FLOWCHARTBOX></FLOWCHARTBOX></FLOWCHARTBOX></FLOWCHARTBOX></ALIAS></EXTENSION></EXTENSIONS></COCHRANE_REVIEW>
