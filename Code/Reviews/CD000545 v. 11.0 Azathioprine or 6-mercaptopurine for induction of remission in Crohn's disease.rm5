<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2016-10-20 08:51:36 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="John K MacDonald">
<P>Azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine are immunosuppressive drugs that are thought to reduce inflammation by blocking the immune system. This review includes 13 randomized trials with a total of 1211 participants. Azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine were found to be no more effective than placebo (fake medicine) for inducing remission in Crohn's disease. There is evidence to suggest that the combination of azathioprine and infliximab is superior to infliximab used as a single drug for induction of steroid-free remission in active Crohn's disease. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha blocking drugs like infliximab may provide an alternative treatment for patients who do not respond to corticosteroid or immunosuppressive drug treatment. Azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine may reduce the need for steroid treatment and their use may therefore lead to a lower incidence of steroid related side effects. However, these drugs are slow acting and are associated with some rare, but serious side effects. In some patients they suppress formation of blood cells that fight off infection and allow blood to clot and they occasionally cause inflammation of the pancreas. These drugs have also been associated with an increased risk of lymphoma. For these reasons careful consideration needs to be given to the use of these drugs in patients with active Crohn's disease.</P>

<P>The results from controlled clinical trials investigating the efficacy of azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine for the treatment of active Crohn's disease have been conflicting and controversial. An updated meta-analysis was performed to assess the effectiveness of these drugs for the induction of remission in active Crohn's disease.</P>

<P>The primary objective was to determine the efficacy and safety of azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine for induction of remission in active Crohn's disease.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2016-09-30 09:28:56 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="John K MacDonald">

<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2013-03-08 09:43:09 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="John K MacDonald">
<P>Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of oral azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine compared to placebo or active therapy involving adult patients with active Crohn's disease were selected for inclusion.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2013-03-08 08:33:55 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="John K MacDonald">
<P>Data were extracted by two independent observers based on the intention-to-treat principle. Outcomes of interest included: clinical remission, clinical improvement, fistula improvement or healing, steroid sparing, adverse events, withdrawals due to adverse events and serious adverse events. We calculated the pooled relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) for each outcome. The methodological quality of included studies was evaluated using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. The overall quality of the evidence supporting each outcome was assessed using the GRADE criteria.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-10-20 08:51:13 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="John K MacDonald">
<P>Thirteen RCTs (n = 1211 patients) of azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine therapy in adult patients were identified: nine included placebo comparators and six included active comparators. The majority of included studies were rated as low risk of bias. There was no statistically significant difference in clinical remission rates between azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine and placebo. Forty-eight per cent (95/197) of patients receiving antimetabolites achieved remission compared to 37% (68/183) of placebo patients (5 studies, 380 patients; RR 1.23, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.55). There was no statistically significant difference in clinical improvement rates between azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine and placebo. Forty-eight per cent (107/225) of patients receiving antimetabolites achieved clinical improvement or remission compared to 36% (75/209) of placebo patients (8 studies, 434 patients; RR 1.26, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.62). There was a statistically significant difference in steroid sparing (defined as prednisone dose &lt; 10 mg/day while maintaining remission) between azathioprine and placebo. Sixty-four per cent (47/163) of azathioprine patients were able to reduce their prednisone dose to &lt; 10 mg/day compared to 46% (32/70) of placebo patients (RR 1.34, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.77). GRADE analyses rated the overall quality of the evidence for the outcomes clinical remission, clinical improvement and steroid sparing as moderate due to sparse data. There was no statistically significant difference in withdrawals due to adverse events or serious adverse events between antimetabolites and placebo. Ten percent of patients in the antimetabolite group withdrew due to adverse events compared to 5% of placebo patients (8 studies, 510 patients; RR 1.70, 95% CI 0.94 to 3.08). Serious adverse events were reported in 14% of patients receiving azathioprine compared to 4% of placebo patients (2 studies, 216 patients; RR 2.57, 95% CI 0.92 to 7.13). Common adverse events reported in the placebo controlled studies included: allergic reactions. leukopenia, pancreatitis and nausea. Azathioprine was significantly inferior to infliximab for induction of steroid-free clinical remission. Thirty per cent (51/170) of azathioprine patients achieved steroid-free remission compared to 44% (75/169) of infliximab patients (1 study, 339 patients; RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.51 to 0.90). The combination of azathioprine and infliximab was significantly superior to infliximab alone for induction of steroid-free clinical remission. Sixty per cent (116/194) of patients in the combined azathioprine and infliximab group achieved steroid-free remission compared to 48% (91/189) of infliximab patients (2 studies, 383 patients; RR 1.23, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.47). Azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine therapy was found to be no better at inducing steroid free clinical remission compared to methotrexate (RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.49) and 5-aminosalicylate or sulfasalazine (RR 1.24, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.91). There were no statistically significant differences in withdrawals due to adverse events between azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine and methotrexate (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.23 to 2.71); between azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine and 5-aminosalicylate or sulfasalazine (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.38 to 2.54); between azathioprine and infliximab (RR 1.47, 95% CI 0.96 to 2.23); or between the combination of azathioprine and infliximab and infliximab (RR 1.16, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.80). Common adverse events in the active comparator trials included nausea, abdominal pain, pyrexia and headache.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2013-03-28 12:43:17 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="John K MacDonald">
<P>Azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine offer no advantage over placebo for induction of remission or clinical improvement in active Crohn's disease. Antimetaboilte therapy may allow patients to reduce steroid consumption. Adverse events were more common in patients receiving antimetabolites although differences with placebo were not statistically significant. Azathioprine therapy is inferior to infliximab for induction of steroid-free remission. However, the combination of azathioprine and infliximab was superior to infliximab alone for induction of steroid-free remission.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2016-10-20 08:51:41 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="John K MacDonald">
<P>6-Mercaptopurine (6-MP) (predominantly used as a chemotherapeutic agent) and its prodrug azathioprine (AZA) (an immune modifier agent) are purine analogues that competitively interfere with nucleic acid metabolism (<LINK REF="REF-Lennard-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lennard 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sahasranaman-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sahasranaman 2008</LINK>). Consequently, both drugs reduce cell proliferation and have immune modulating properties. A deficiency of thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT) enzyme appears to account for some dose- and metabolism-dependent toxicities such as leukopenia (and possible subsequent infection), thrombocytopenia, and malignancy (<LINK REF="REF-Lennard-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lennard 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lennard-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lennard 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Weinshilboum-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weinshilboum 1980</LINK>). Other toxicities such as rash, fever, arthralgias, pancreatitis, hepatitis, nausea, non-pancreatic abdominal pain and diarrhea appear to be hypersensitivity reactions (<LINK REF="REF-Sandborn-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sandborn 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>Azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine have both been used to treat patients with active, steroid-refractory, and steroid-dependent Crohn's disease, and patients with fistulizing Crohn's disease. Uncontrolled trials suggested efficacy for azathioprine (<LINK REF="REF-Avery_x002d_Jones-1966" TYPE="REFERENCE">Avery-Jones 1966</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Brooke-1969" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brooke 1969</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Brooke-1970" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brooke 1970</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Brooke-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brooke 1976</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Brown-1970" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brown 1970</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Colonna-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Colonna 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-D_x0027_Haens-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">D'Haens 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-D_x0027_Haens-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">D'Haens 1997</LINK> <LINK REF="REF-Drucker-1970" TYPE="REFERENCE">Drucker 1970</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fausa-1971" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fausa 1971</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Javett-1972" TYPE="REFERENCE">Javett 1972</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kessler-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kessler 1995</LINK> <LINK REF="REF-Korelitz-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Korelitz 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Korelitz-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Korelitz 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lemann-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lemann 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lennard_x002d_Jones-1972" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lennard-Jones 1972</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Markowitz-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Markowitz 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nyman-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nyman 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Brien-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Brien 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Patterson-1971" TYPE="REFERENCE">Patterson 1971</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Papp-1974" TYPE="REFERENCE">Papp 1974</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Perrault-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Perrault 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rhodes-1971" TYPE="STUDY">Rhodes 1971</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shah-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shah 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Verhave-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Verhave 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wallensten-1972" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wallensten 1972</LINK>). Placebo controlled clinical trials have been performed in order to determine whether the results of these uncontrolled studies are valid (<LINK REF="STD-Candy-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Candy 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ewe-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Ewe 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Klein-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Klein 1974</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Oren-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Oren 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Present-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Present 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Reinisch-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Reinisch 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rhodes-1971" TYPE="STUDY">Rhodes 1971</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Summers-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Summers 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Willoughby-1971" TYPE="STUDY">Willoughby 1971</LINK>). The results from these controlled trials were conflicting and controversies regarding efficacy developed (<LINK REF="REF-Korelitz-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Korelitz 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lennard_x002d_Jones-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lennard-Jones 1981</LINK>). Much of the controversy centered on design flaws in some of the studies, which failed to take into account the prolonged time to onset of drug action (3 to 4 months minimum). Careful analysis of the controlled data, paying attention to duration of therapy, concomitant medications, and drug dosage, may reveal logical explanations for conflicting data and allow more valid conclusions to be reached regarding efficacy. There have also been studies comparing AZA or 6-MP to other active treatments or in combination with these treatments (<LINK REF="STD-Ardizzone-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ardizzone 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Colombel-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Colombel 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mat_x00e9__x002d_Jim_x00e9_nez-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Maté-Jiménez 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Oren-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Oren 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Summers-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Summers 1979</LINK>).

The proportion of patients with clinical improvement or remission was a secondary outcome. The definitions of remission and improvement varied from study to study making exact comparisons across studies difficult. Therefore, the definition of improvement or remission used in each study was used for data extraction. Other outcomes of interest included fistula improvement or healing, steroid sparing effect, adverse events, withdrawals due to adverse events, and serious adverse events. Included studies were also reviewed for adverse events commonly associated with antimetabolites including: leukopenia, infection, thrombocytopenia, malignancy, rash, fever, arthralgias, pancreatitis, hepatitis, nausea, non-pancreatic abdominal pain, and diarrhea.</P>

<P>Eligible articles were reviewed in duplicate and the results of the primary research trials were abstracted. Data were then extracted onto specially designed data extraction forms.</P>
<P>We used the Cochrane risk of bias tool to assess the methodological quality of the included studies (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). The following study characteristics were assessed:</P>
<OL>
<LI>Randomization sequence generation;</LI>
<LI>Allocation concealment;</LI>
<LI>Blinding of participants, outcome assessors and investigators;</LI>
<LI>Incomplete outcome reporting (i.e. there was an acceptable method of dealing with attrition);</LI>
<LI>Selective outcome reporting (i.e. all outcomes described in the methods were included in the analysis); and</LI>
<LI>Other potential sources of bias.</LI>
</OL>
<P>Based on these characteristics, studies were judged to have a high, low or unclear risk of bias.</P>
<P>We used the GRADE approach to assess the overall quality of evidence for the primary outcome and selected secondary outcomes of interest. Outcomes from pooling of randomized trials start as high quality evidence, but may be downgraded due to: (1) risk of bias, (2) indirectness of evidence, (3) inconsistency (unexplained heterogeneity), (4) imprecision (sparse data), and (5) reporting bias (publication bias). The overall quality of evidence for each outcome was determined after considering each of these elements, and categorized as high quality (i.e. further research is very unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect); moderate quality (i.e. further research is likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and may change the estimate); low quality (i.e. further research is very likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and is likely to change the estimate); or very low quality (i.e. we are very uncertain about the estimate) (<LINK REF="REF-Guyatt-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guyatt 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sch_x00fc_nemann-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schünemann 2011</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Statistical Analysis:</HEADING>
<P>Data were analyzed using Review Manager (RevMan 5). The risk ratio (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were calculated for each dichotomous outcome. Data from individual trials were combined for meta-analysis if the interventions, patient groups and outcomes were sufficiently similar (determined by consensus). A fixed-effect model was used to pool data in the absence of heterogeneity. A random-effects model was used when significant heterogeneity was detected. Heterogeneity was assessed using the Chi<SUP>2</SUP> test (a P value of 0.10 will be regarded as statistically significant). The l<SUP>2</SUP> statistic was used to estimate the degree of heterogeneity. This measure describes the percentage of total variation across studies that results from heterogeneity rather than chance. A value of 25% is considered to indicate low heterogeneity, 50% moderate heterogeneity and 75% high heterogeneity (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2003</LINK>). Sensitivity analyses were used to explore potential sources of heterogeneity.</P>

<P>A literature search conducted on October 30, 2015 identified 1609 records. Seven additional studies were identified through searching of conference abstracts. After duplicates were removed, a total of 1161 trials remained for review of titles and abstracts. Two authors (CMT and CEP) independently reviewed the titles and abstracts of these trials and 59 studies were selected for full text review (see <LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>). Thirty-two reports of 23 studies were excluded (See: <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_EXCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of excluded studies</LINK>). Twenty-seven reports of 13 trials met the pre-defined inclusion criteria and were included in the review (<LINK REF="STD-Ardizzone-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ardizzone 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Candy-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Candy 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Colombel-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Colombel 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ewe-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Ewe 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Klein-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Klein 1974</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mantzaris-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Mantzaris 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mat_x00e9__x002d_Jim_x00e9_nez-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Maté-Jiménez 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Oren-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Oren 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Present-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Present 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Reinisch-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Reinisch 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rhodes-1971" TYPE="STUDY">Rhodes 1971</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Summers-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Summers 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Willoughby-1971" TYPE="STUDY">Willoughby 1971</LINK>).</P>
<P>The 13 selected trials (n = 1211 patients) had a variety of designs: seven were exclusively concerned with therapy of active disease (<LINK REF="STD-Colombel-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Colombel 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ewe-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Ewe 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Klein-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Klein 1974</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mat_x00e9__x002d_Jim_x00e9_nez-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Maté-Jiménez 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Present-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Present 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Reinisch-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Reinisch 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rhodes-1971" TYPE="STUDY">Rhodes 1971</LINK>) and two trials had separate arms for patients with active and quiescent disease (<LINK REF="STD-Summers-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Summers 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Willoughby-1971" TYPE="STUDY">Willoughby 1971</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Oren-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Oren 1997</LINK> compared therapy with 6-mercaptopurine, methotrexate, or placebo for active disease and subsequently for quiescent disease (if the patient responded) without randomizing for maintenance of remission therapy. In three trials patients were treated with 6-mercaptopurine (<LINK REF="STD-Mat_x00e9__x002d_Jim_x00e9_nez-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Maté-Jiménez 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Oren-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Oren 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Present-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Present 1980</LINK>). All the other included studies treated patients with azathioprine. Azathioprine is rapidly converted to 6-mercaptopurine in vivo, and the clinical indications for using azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine are similar so it was decided that these trials could be pooled for meta-analysis. The authors of the National Co-operative Crohn's Disease Study (<LINK REF="STD-Summers-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Summers 1979</LINK>) divided their study into three parts and compared azathioprine, prednisone, sulfasalazine and placebo. Part I phase one dealt with patients with active disease, while part I phase two examined the ability of these patients to maintain their remission. Part II patients entered the study in remission. This review deals only with part I phase one for remission and all of part I for adverse event data (<LINK REF="STD-Summers-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Summers 1979</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Candy-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Candy 1995</LINK> was divided into two parts. The first part treated active disease and the second part enrolled those who had successfully completed part one and examined their ability to maintain remission. This review deals only with part one of the Candy study.</P>

Patients who were successfully induced at six weeks were entered into a one year maintenance phase and were treated with either infliximab or azathioprine alone (<LINK REF="STD-Mantzaris-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Mantzaris 2004</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Mat_x00e9__x002d_Jim_x00e9_nez-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Maté-Jiménez 2000</LINK> randomized patients to one of three treatments: 6-mercaptopurine, azathioprine or 5-aminosalicyclic acid. Patients were followed for induction of remission at 30 weeks and then for maintenance through 76 weeks. <LINK REF="STD-Reinisch-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Reinisch 2008</LINK> had three different treatment arms: everolimus, azathioprine and placebo. This trial was stopped early (at seven months) due to lack of efficacy of everolimus.</P>
<P>All patients were symptomatic: some had an acute exacerbation of previously quiescent disease (<LINK REF="STD-Ewe-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Ewe 1993</LINK>), other patients had chronic disease unresponsive to other therapy such as steroids (<LINK REF="STD-Ardizzone-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ardizzone 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Colombel-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Colombel 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Klein-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Klein 1974</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mat_x00e9__x002d_Jim_x00e9_nez-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Maté-Jiménez 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Willoughby-1971" TYPE="STUDY">Willoughby 1971</LINK>), and some (<LINK REF="STD-Candy-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Candy 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Oren-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Oren 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Present-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Present 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Reinisch-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Reinisch 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rhodes-1971" TYPE="STUDY">Rhodes 1971</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Summers-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Summers 1979</LINK>) were evaluated only on the severity of their symptoms at the time of randomization.

A pooled analysis (3 studies, n = 143 patients) revealed no statistically significant advantage for azathioprine or 6-MP over methotrexate, with 60% (45/75) of patients in the antimetabolites group achieving steroid-free remission compared to 57% (39/68) of methotrexate patients (RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.49). No statistically significant heterogeneity was detected for this comparison (P = 0.95; I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 0%). A GRADE analysis indicates that the overall quality of the evidence for this outcome was low due to sparse data (75 events) and a high risk of bias in two of the studies in the pooled analysis (See <LINK REF="SOF-04" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 4</LINK>).</P>

A pooled analysis (2 studies, 85 patients) showed that adverse events were significantly more likely in patients receiving methotrexate compared to azathioprine or 6-MP. Overall, adverse events occurred in 19% (8/43) of azathioprine or 6-MP patients compared to 45% (19/42) of methotrexate patients (RR 0.42, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.82).

A GRADE analysis indicates that the overall quality of the evidence for this outcome was very low due to sparse data (9 events), very wide confidence intervals and a high risk of bias in two of the studies in the pooled analysis.

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2016-09-14 14:36:39 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="Tran M Nguyen">
<P>This updated review includes 13 randomized controlled trials (n = 1211 patients) which examined the efficacy of azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine for inducing remission in Crohn's disease. These trials compared these antimetabolites to placebo and various active therapies including infliximab, methotrexate and 5-aminosalicylate. The definitions of remission and improvement varied from study to study making exact comparisons across studies difficult. Only 5 of 9 (<LINK REF="STD-Candy-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Candy 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ewe-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Ewe 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Oren-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Oren 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Reinisch-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Reinisch 2008</LINK>; <A HREF="http://archie.cochrane.org/sections/documents/view?version=z1212051447563223872046645433900&amp;format=REVMAN#STD-Summers-1979">Summers 1979</A>) placebo-controlled studies used generally accepted and validated criteria (either a Crohn's Disease Activity Index score &lt; 150 points or a Harvey-Bradshaw Index score <U>&lt;</U> 3 points) to define remission. The other four studies used subjective improvement or other non-validated outcome measures (<LINK REF="STD-Klein-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Klein 1974</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Present-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Present 1980</LINK>; <A HREF="http://archie.cochrane.org/sections/documents/view?version=z1212051447563223872046645433900&amp;format=REVMAN#STD-Rhodes-1971">Rhodes 1971</A>; <A HREF="http://archie.cochrane.org/sections/documents/view?version=z1212051447563223872046645433900&amp;format=REVMAN#STD-Willoughby-1971">Willoughby 1971</A>). Azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine therapy was found to be no better than placebo (5 studies, 380 patients, RR 1.23, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.55) for achieving clinical remission. When clinical remission or improvement is considered as an outcome there was no statistically significant difference between azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine and placebo (434 patients, RR 1.26, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.62). These results suggest that azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine offer no advantage over placebo for induction of remission or clinical improvement in active Crohn's disease. We believe that the methodological basis for these conclusions is sound. The quality of the individual trials was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool and the possibility of bias was judged to be low for these studies. A GRADE analysis indicated that the overall quality of the evidence supporting these outcomes is moderate due to sparse data. These findings agree with a recent meta-analysis of immunosuppressives in inflammatory bowel disease (<LINK REF="REF-Khan-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Khan 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>The ability to taper or discontinue corticosteroids is an important outcome to consider when treating Crohn's disease. Four older trials (<LINK REF="STD-Candy-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Candy 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ewe-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Ewe 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Klein-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Klein 1974</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Willoughby-1971" TYPE="STUDY">Willoughby 1971</LINK>) reported steroid-sparing (e.g. final prednisone dose &lt; 10 mg/day) as an outcome. A pooled analysis of these studies showed that azathioprine had a statistically significant steroid sparing effect compared to placebo (143 patients, RR 1.34, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.77). A GRADE analysis indicated that the overall quality of the evidence supporting this outcome was moderate. The role of combined antimetabolite and steroid therapy in active disease has been controversial. The National Cooperative Crohn's Disease Study (<LINK REF="STD-Summers-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Summers 1979</LINK>) failed to show a statistically significant benefit for azathioprine monotherapy and has been criticised for not allowing concurrent steroid therapy during the lag period before azathioprine could act, and for not allowing sufficient time to assess the response to azathioprine (<LINK REF="REF-Korelitz-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Korelitz 1981</LINK>). Combination therapy with azathioprine and steroids may lead to a higher response rate with less steroid use.</P>
<P>More recent trials comparing antimetabolites to other active therapies reported steroid-free clinical remission as an outcome (<LINK REF="STD-Ardizzone-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ardizzone 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Colombel-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Colombel 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mantzaris-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Mantzaris 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mat_x00e9__x002d_Jim_x00e9_nez-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Maté-Jiménez 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Oren-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Oren 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Reinisch-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Reinisch 2008</LINK>). 6-Mercaptopurine was found to be significantly better at inducing steroid-free remission than 5-aminosalicyclates (23 patients, RR 6.56, 95% CI 1.06 to 40.46). However, this result should be interpreted with caution due to the small number of patients included in the analysis and the poor methodological quality of the <LINK REF="STD-Mat_x00e9__x002d_Jim_x00e9_nez-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Maté-Jiménez 2000</LINK> study. The overall quality of the evidence was rated as very low using the GRADE approach due to risk of bias, imprecision and inconsistency. The <LINK REF="STD-Oren-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Oren 1997</LINK> study is not adequate to determine the relative benefits of 6-mercaptopurine versus methotrexate. The sample size was small, both drugs were probably under-dosed (6-mercaptopurine 50 mg/day and methotrexate 12.5 mg/week orally), and neither drug was reported to be superior to placebo. A trial comparing oral 6-mercaptopurine 1.5 mg/kg/d or azathioprine 2 to 3 mg/kg/d with parenteral methotrexate 25 mg/wk for chronic active Crohn's disease would be of interest. A pooled analysis including three studies found no statistically significant difference in steroid-free clinical remission between azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine and methotrexate (143 patients, RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.49). However, the results of this pooled analysis need to be interpreted with caution due to the small number of patients included in the analysis and because of a high risk of bias in two of the studies in the pooled analysis ( <LINK REF="STD-Ardizzone-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ardizzone 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mat_x00e9__x002d_Jim_x00e9_nez-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Maté-Jiménez 2000</LINK>). Furthermore, none of the three studies in the pooled analysis were designed as formal non-inferiority studies. A GRADE analysis indicated that the overall quality of the evidence supporting this outcome was low. Azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine may be better choices as first line steroid sparing agents than methotrexate due to the propensity for adverse effects. A pooled analysis of two studies found that patients taking methotrexate were significantly more likely than patients taking azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine to experience an adverse event (85 patients, RR 0.42, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.82). More high quality trials comparing azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine with 5-aminosalicyclates or methotrexate are required to determine the true comparative efficacy and safety of these interventions.</P>
<P>Azathioprine was found to be significantly less effective than infliximab (339 patients, RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.51 to 0.87) for achieving clinical remission. The addition of azathioprine to infliximab significantly improved clinical remission rates (338 patients, RR 1.26, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.54) compared to azathioprine alone. The combination of azathioprine and infliximab was found to be significantly superior to infliximab alone (383 patients, RR 1.23, 95% CI1.02 to 1.47) for induction of steroid-free remission. Azathioprine was found to be significantly inferior to infliximab therapy (339 patients, RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.51 to 0.90) for induction of steroid-free remission. A GRADE analysis rated the overall quality of the evidence for this comparison as moderate. <LINK REF="STD-Colombel-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Colombel 2010</LINK> also reported mucosal healing as an outcome. Azathioprine was found to be significantly inferior to infliximab for mucosal healing (RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.33 to 0.94). The combination of azathioprine and infliximab was found to be significantly superior to infliximab alone for mucosal healing (RR 1.50, 95% CI 1.02 to 2.19). A GRADE analysis rated the overall quality of the evidence for these outcomes as moderate due to sparse data. More high quality trials comparing the combination of azathioprine with infliximab to infliximab alone are required to confirm the benefit of this combination.</P>
<P>The use of azathioprine for refractory fistulae was originally based on uncontrolled reports (<LINK REF="REF-Avery_x002d_Jones-1966" TYPE="REFERENCE">Avery-Jones 1966</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Brown-1970" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brown 1970</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Brooke-1970" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brooke 1970</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Drucker-1970" TYPE="REFERENCE">Drucker 1970</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Korelitz-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Korelitz 1985</LINK>). For three placebo controlled trials that reported numerical results ( <LINK REF="STD-Klein-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Klein 1974</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rhodes-1971" TYPE="STUDY">Rhodes 1971</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Willoughby-1971" TYPE="STUDY">Willoughby 1971</LINK>;), azathioprine therapy was found to have no advantage over placebo for fistula healing (RR 2.00, 95% CI 0.67 to 5.93). However, this pooled analysis included only 18 patients and further research is necessary to determine if azathioprine provides a benefit for fistula healing. In the <LINK REF="STD-Present-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Present 1980</LINK> study, forty fistulae were observed in 36 patients, and 9/29 (31%) of fistulae closed completely during treatment with 6-mercaptopurine compared with 1/17 (6%) of fistulae which closed during treatment with placebo (these numbers represent overlapping patients, some who crossed over and some who did not). The <LINK REF="STD-Present-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Present 1980</LINK> data were not included in this systematic review because the data were reported as the number of fistulae closing, rather than the number of patients who had complete fistulae closure, and because the fistulae data were not presented in a way that made separation of the results from the first phase of the crossover study possible. The principle author of this study was contacted, and the original data are no longer available to address these issues. The results from two other studies which reported no significant effect ( <LINK REF="STD-Ewe-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Ewe 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Summers-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Summers 1979</LINK>) also could not be included in the analysis because the fistulae data were not available. The lack of specific reporting on fistula response in these two trials may represent publication bias, as negative results were not reported. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of azathioprine designed to specifically address the question of efficacy in the subgroup of patients with fistulizing (perforating) Crohn's disease would be of interest.</P>
<P>The adverse effects of antimetabolite therapy are well recognised ( <LINK REF="REF-Alstead-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alstead 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Haber-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haber 1986</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Rhodes-1971" TYPE="STUDY">Rhodes 1971</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rosman-1973" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rosman 1973</LINK>). Patients with Crohn's disease may have similar symptoms, so a comparison with a control group is useful to estimate the incidence of adverse effects attributable to therapy. Although there was no statistically significant difference in withdrawals due to adverse events, patients receiving azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine may be more likely to withdraw due to an adverse event. <LINK REF="REF-Present-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Present 1989</LINK> reviewed their extensive experience with 6-mercaptopurine in 396 patients with inflammatory bowel disease and approximately 1800 patient-years of follow-up. <LINK REF="REF-Present-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Present 1989</LINK> reported a higher incidence of adverse reactions, presumably due to the longer duration of therapy and observation: significant infection (7.4%), pancreatitis (3.3%), neoplasm (3.1%), bone marrow suppression (2.0%), allergy (2.0%), and drug-induced hepatitis (0.3%). <LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Brien-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Brien 1991</LINK> reported an overall 10% incidence of adverse events sufficiently severe to justify stopping azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine in their uncontrolled series of 78 patients with Crohn's disease. Two studies detailing the low toxicity of azathioprine with respect to bone marrow suppression and cancer risk in 755 patients with inflammatory bowel disease treated over 27 years have been reported (<LINK REF="REF-Connell-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Connell 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Connell-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Connell 1994</LINK>). A follow-up report of patients with Crohn's disease treated with azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine for up to 166 months did not show an increase in toxicity with long term use (<LINK REF="REF-Bouhnik-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bouhnik 1996</LINK>). More recent studies confirm the low risk of bone marrow suppression and cancer in IBD patients treated with azathioprine (<LINK REF="REF-Fraser-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fraser 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gisbert-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gisbert 2008</LINK>). The time course for the occurrence of adverse events is variable. Allergic reactions and pancreatitis usually occur within a few weeks of beginning therapy, whereas bone marrow suppression, infection, and hepatitis may occur at any time. It was not possible to ascertain from the controlled trials reviewed for this meta-analysis what the time course was for the various forms of drug toxicity observed.</P>
<P>Four active comparator trials reported the proportion of patients who experienced at least one adverse event (<LINK REF="STD-Ardizzone-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ardizzone 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Colombel-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Colombel 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mantzaris-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Mantzaris 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mat_x00e9__x002d_Jim_x00e9_nez-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Maté-Jiménez 2000</LINK>). There was no statistically significant difference in adverse events rates between azathioprine and infliximab (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.08). Furthermore, the combination of azathioprine and infliximab was found to have a similar rate of adverse event compared to infliximab alone (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.09). Data on withdrawals due to adverse events were available for all of the comparisons. There were no statistically significant differences in withdrawals secondary to adverse events between azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine and methotrexate (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.23 to 2.71), between 6-mercaptopurine and aminosalicylates (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.38 to 2.54) or between azathioprine and infliximab (RR 1.47, 95% CI 0.96 to 2.23). Moreover, combined therapy with infliximab and azathioprine did not cause increased withdrawals due to adverse events compared to infliximab alone (RR 1.16, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.80). The rate of serious adverse events was only reported in one study (<LINK REF="STD-Colombel-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Colombel 2010</LINK>). Azathioprine was found to have similar serious adverse event rate compared to infliximab (RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.62). However, the addition of azathioprine to infliximab was found to significantly decrease the risk of a serious adverse event compared to infliximab alone (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.41 to 0.98). GRADE analyses indicated that the overall quality of the evidence supporting these outcomes was low to moderate due to sparse data (<LINK REF="STD-Colombel-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Colombel 2010</LINK>) or high risk of bias (<LINK REF="STD-Ardizzone-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ardizzone 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mat_x00e9__x002d_Jim_x00e9_nez-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Maté-Jiménez 2000</LINK>). Further research is necessary to assess the long term safety of azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine.</P>
<P>The above findings from the present meta-analysis highlight some of the problems with the use of azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine in active Crohn's disease. First and foremost, our meta-analysis shows that antimetabolite therapy provides no benefit over placebo for induction of remission or clinical improvement in active Crohn's disease. This can be explained by the fact that in most of the included placebo-controlled trials except <LINK REF="STD-Summers-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Summers 1979</LINK>, all patients received steroids with their study intervention. Remission was induced by the steroids in these studies and not by azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine. Azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine may affect the pace at which steroids can be tapered. The time to steroid free remission was not assessed in this review. Thus, future research could consider including time to steroid-free remission as an outcome.</P>
<P>Furthermore, antimetabolite therapy may take a few months before onset of drug action (e.g. approximately three months, <LINK REF="STD-Present-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Present 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sahasranaman-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sahasranaman 2008</LINK>). To explore this we analyzed placebo-controlled trials by the time point when remission or clinical improvement was measured. Azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine patients evaluated at 17 weeks or later were significantly more likely to be in remission than those taking placebo (RR 1.59, 95% CI 1.05 to 2.41). When remission or clinical improvement was measured before 17 weeks there was no statistically significant difference between antimetabolites and placebo (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.40). These results suggest that a period of 17 weeks may be the minimum time period for an adequate trial of antimetabolite therapy. It had been postulated that the apparent long duration of therapy required to achieve benefit may be due to a requirement for equilibration of the active metabolite of the drug within tissues. It was also suggested that a high intravenous loading dose of the drug might overcome this problem (<LINK REF="REF-Sandborn-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sandborn 1995</LINK>). However, a placebo-controlled trial of intravenous azathioprine loading (40 mg/kg over 36 hours) in patients with active steroid-refractory Crohn's disease receiving oral azathioprine did not show any benefit (<LINK REF="REF-Sandborn-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sandborn 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>Apart from potentially expediting induction of steroid-free remission, azathioprine may have a role as an adjunctive therapy to infliximab. This was illustrated by the superiority of the combination of infliximab and azathioprine to monotherapy with azathioprine or infliximab. Therapy with azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine may help to prevent the development of antibodies to infliximab. The development of antibodies to infliximab has been associated with a loss of response to infliximab and the development of infusion reactions. An analysis of the ACCENT I data by Hanauer and colleagues found that patients who received immunosuppressive therapy (i.e. azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine or methotrexate) in conjunction with infliximab had a significantly lower chance of developing antibodies to infliximab than patients who received infliximab monotherapy (<LINK REF="REF-Hanauer-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hanauer 2004</LINK>). However, patients who were found to be positive for these antibodies were not less likely to have a clinical response or be in clinical remission at the end of the study. These results should be interpreted with caution as only 80 patients had positive antibodies (<LINK REF="REF-Hanauer-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hanauer 2004</LINK>). Future trials should evaluate the interaction between antimetabolite therapy and infliximab with respect to antibody formation and efficacy.</P>

<P>Azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine offer no advantage over placebo for induction of remission or clinical improvement in active Crohn's disease. Antimetabolite therapy may allow patients to reduce steroid consumption. There is evidence to suggest that the combination of azathioprine and infliximab is superior to infliximab monotherapy for induction of steroid-free remission in active Crohn's disease.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2016-10-21 08:37:26 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="John K MacDonald">
<P>All of the studies reported in this analysis used clinical improvement or remission as the primary outcome. It would be of interest to know whether azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine can induce mucosal healing. Preliminary uncontrolled observations have suggested that azathioprine does result in endoscopic healing of active Crohn's disease (<LINK REF="REF-D_x0027_Haens-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">D'Haens 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sandborn-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sandborn 1995</LINK>;). Future studies should assess time to steroid-free remission as an outcome. The available data on fistulae closure in patients with Crohn's disease treated with azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine is not adequate to make definite conclusions regarding efficacy. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of azathioprine therapy in patients with active fistulizing Crohn's disease would be of interest. More high quality trials comparing azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine with 5-aminosalicyclates or methotrexate are required to determine the true comparative efficacy and safety of these interventions. Further research is required to confirm the superiority of combination of azathioprine and infliximab to infliximab monotherapy. Future research should also assess the efficacy and safety of the use of azathioprine with other biologics.</P>
