<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2010-12-06 14:17:16 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review finds that laparoscopic surgery for small bowel Crohn's disease may be as safe as conventional surgery. There is no significant difference in the perioperative outcomes and long-term disease recurrence rates. However, there are only two RCTs (including 120 patients) so far and no reliable conclusions can be made regarding the benefits of laparoscopic surgery.</P>

<P>Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease that most commonly involves the terminal ileum and colon (55 percent). Surgical treatment is required in approximately 70 percent of patients. Multiple procedures and repeat operations are required in 30 - 70 percent of all patients (<A HREF="Duepree 2002">Duepree 2002</A>) but the disease remains incurable.</P>
<P>Laparoscopy has gained wide acceptance in gastrointestinal surgery with potential advantages of faster return to normal activity and diet, reduced hospital stay, reduced postoperative pain, better cosmesis (<A HREF="Duepree 2002">Duepree 2002</A>, <A HREF="Dunker 1998">Dunker 1998</A>, <A HREF="Milsom 2001">Milsom 2001</A>, <A HREF="Reissman 1996">Reissman 1996</A>), improved social and sexual interaction (<A HREF="Albaz 2000">Albaz 2000</A>) and its use is accepted in benign and malignant colorectal diseases. Laparoscopic surgery offers additional advantage of smaller abdominal fascial wounds, low incidence of hernias, and decreased rate of adhesive small-bowel obstruction (<A HREF="Albaz 2000">Albaz 2000</A>) compared with conventional surgery reducing the need for non-disease-related surgical procedures in CD population.</P>
<P>There are concerns about missing occult segments of disease and critical proximal strictures due to limited tactile ability, earlier recurrence due to possible reduced immune response induced by laparoscopy, technical difficulty due to fragile inflamed bowel and mesentery and the existence of adhesions, fistulas, and abscesses (<A HREF="Uchikoshi 2004">Uchikoshi 2004</A>).

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2010-12-01 04:07:17 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Crohn's disease (CD) is a common chronic inflammatory bowel disease usually characterised by patchy granulomatous inflammation of whole thickness of bowel that can affect any part of gastrointestinal tract. The incidence of CD is 5-10 per 100 000 per year with a prevalence of 50-100 per 100 000 (<LINK REF="REF-Carter-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carter 2004</LINK>). Clinical patterns include combined small and large intestinal pattern (26% to 48%), small intestine only pattern (11% to 48%) and colon only pattern (19% to 51%) (<LINK REF="REF-Munkholm-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Munkholm 2004</LINK>). Of these, involvement of terminal ileum and colon is the most common pattern (55%). Involvement of duodenum, oesophagus, stomach and mouth is uncommon and this rarely occurs without concurrent disease activity in the small bowel and / or colon (<LINK REF="REF-Thoreson-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thoreson 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>Patients with small bowel CD commonly present with an acute exacerbation characterised by abdominal cramps, diarrhoea, malaise and loss of weight that is primarily managed medically using steroids, immunomodulators (Azathioprine, Mercaptopurine, Methotrexate) or biological therapy (anti-TNF agents) (<LINK REF="REF-Travis-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Travis 2006</LINK>). Surgical treatment is required in approximately 70 percent of patients (<LINK REF="REF-Fazio-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fazio 1993</LINK>) for failed medical therapy, recurrent intestinal obstruction, malnutrition and for septic complications (free perforation, abscess). Reoperation is required in 70 to 90 percent of all patients and multiple procedures in more than 30 percent (<LINK REF="REF-Duepree-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Duepree 2002</LINK>) but the disease remains incurable. Resection and anastomosis is indicated for short segment with multiple strictures or active disease, diseased bowel with fistula, abscess or phlegmon. Strictureplasty is a safe and effective alternative to bowel resection in view of the potential for recurrent operative resections resulting in short bowel syndrome (<LINK REF="REF-Fazio-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fazio 1993</LINK>).</P>
<P>Laparoscopy has gained wide acceptance in gastrointestinal surgery with potential advantages of faster return to normal activity and diet, reduced hospital stay, reduced postoperative pain, better cosmesis (<LINK REF="REF-Duepree-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Duepree 2002</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Dunker-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dunker 1998</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Milsom-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Milsom 2001</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Reissman-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reissman 1996</LINK>), improved social and sexual interaction (<LINK REF="REF-Albaz-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Albaz 2000</LINK>) and its use is accepted in benign and malignant colorectal diseases. Milsom (<LINK REF="REF-Milsom-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Milsom 1993</LINK>) first reported laparoscopic intestinal resection for patients with CD. Laparoscopic surgery offers additional advantage of smaller abdominal fascial wounds, low incidence of hernias, and decreased rate of adhesive small-bowel obstruction (<LINK REF="REF-Albaz-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Albaz 2000</LINK>) compared with conventional surgery reducing the need for non-disease-related surgical procedures in CD population.</P>

<B>Study selection</B>
<BR/>Two authors (BD and DM) examined all citations and abstracts derived from the electronic search strategy and independently selected the trials to be included in the review. <BR/>A standardized form was used to assess eligibility of trials for inclusion in the study.</P>
<P>
<B>Assessment of methodological quality<BR/>
</B>Methodological quality of eligible trials were assessed by two authors (BD and DM) independently in terms of quality of randomisation, time of randomisation (pre-operative, intraoperative), data analysis according to the 'intention-to-treat' principle, similarity between treatment and comparison group at entry, allocation concealment and dropouts.</P>
<P>
<B>Data extraction<BR/>
</B>A data extraction form was developed and used to extract and record information on results of included studies. Results were compared between reviewers. Minor differences of opinion were settled by discussion.</P>
<P>
<B>Data analysis</B>
<BR/>Data were analysed using the RevMan Analyses version 1.0.5 in the software Review Manager (version 5.0). Heterogeneity was assessed using chi-square test with P-value of &lt;0.10 considered as statistically significant. I<SUP>2 </SUP>was assessed to quantify the degree of heterogeneity present. A fixed effects model was used when there was no or little heterogeneity (I<SUP>2</SUP> &lt; 30%), and random effects model was used when there was statistically significant moderate heterogeneity (I<SUP>2</SUP> up to 50%). The odds ratio and 95% confidence intervals were derived for dichotomous outcomes.</P>

<B>Primary outcome measures<BR/>
</B>Morbidity rates including septic complications:</P>
<P>Wound infection</P>
<P>9/59 patients in the open group and 2/61 patients in the laparoscopic group were reported to have wound infection. The difference in the wound infection rates was not statistically significant. Odds ratio (random) 0.25 [0.03,2.39, P=0.23] (<LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>)</P>
<P>Pneumonia</P>
<P>There was no significant difference in the incidence of post operative pneumonia between the two groups (1/61 in laparoscopic group vs 1/59 in open group; Odds ratio 0.97 [0.13,6.98, P=0.97] (<LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>)</P>
<P>Urinary tract infection</P>
<P>One of the two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Maartense-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Maartense 2006</LINK>) has reported the incidence of urinary tract infections with no difference in the incidence between the two groups (2/61 in laparoscopic group vs 2/59 in open group; P=1.00).</P>
<P>Anastomotic leak</P>
<P>1 of the 61 patients in the laparoscopic group had anastomotic leakage (<LINK REF="STD-Milsom-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Milsom 2001</LINK>). The difference in the incidence of anastomotic leak rates between the two groups was not statistically significant. Odds ratio 2.90 [0.11,74.12, P=0.52] (<LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK>)</P>
<P>Intraabdominal abscesses</P>
<P>2/59 patients in the open group had postoperative intra abdominal abscesses (<LINK REF="STD-Maartense-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Maartense 2006</LINK>). The difference in the incidence of intraabdominal abscesses between the two groups was not statistically significant.

<P>Two patients in the open group required reoperation (for adhesiolysis and necrotising wound infection) and one patient in the laparoscopic group required reoperation (for anastomotic leak) within 30 days of primary surgery. The reoperation rates between the two groups was not statistically significant. Odds ratio 0.57 [0.07,4.46, P=0.59] (<LINK REF="FIG-05" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 5</LINK>)</P>

<P>Mortality</P>
<P>There was no mortality in the included studies.</P>
<P>Conversion rates</P>
<P>Conversion rates from laparoscopic to open surgery were similar in both the trials [3/30 (<LINK REF="STD-Maartense-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Maartense 2006</LINK>) and 2/33 (<LINK REF="STD-Milsom-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Milsom 2001</LINK>)].</P>

<P>Reoperation rates for disease recurrence</P>
<P>There was no significant difference in the reoperation rates for disease recurrence. 10/57 patients in the laparoscopic group needed reoperation and 11/54 patients underwent surgical intervention for recurrent disease.

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2010-12-06 14:21:16 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review compared the laparoscopic and open surgical options in the management of small bowel CD. We aimed to perform a subgroup analysis to compare the commonly performed surgical procedures, among CD patients, such as ileocolic resection and anastomosis, small bowel resection and anastomosis, strictureplasty. However, only two randomised controlled trials were published (total of 120 patients) comparing the ileocolic resection and anastomosis in the management of small bowel CD and these were included in the review.</P>
<P>Post operative morbidity and 30-day reoperation rates were considered as primary outcome measures. Less number of patients in the laparoscopic group (2/61) suffered wound infection compared to the open group (9/59) but the difference was not statistically significant (P=0.23).  Similarily, there was no significant difference in the incidence of other postoperative complications assessed - postoperative pneumonia, duration of postoperative ileus and urinary tract infections. The incidence of anastomotic leak and intra abdominal abscess rates were comparable between the two groups. The 30-day reoperation rates among the two groups were also comparable.</P>
<P>Surgery for small bowel CD could be technically demanding due to the inflamed bowel, thickened mesentery and associated increased vascularity. Mobilisation of an inflammatory mass adherent to the retroperitoneum including the ureters , gonadal vessels and the remaining small bowel could often be difficult with conventional surgery. Therefore, the duration of surgery is expected to be shorter with open surgery and was reflected in the included studies [P&lt;0.003 in <LINK REF="STD-Maartense-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Maartense 2006</LINK> and P&lt;0.0001 in <LINK REF="STD-Milsom-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Milsom 2001</LINK>]. For the same reasons, the amount of intra operative blood loss could be lower with the open surgery. Mean intra operative blood loss was reported in one of the two included studies. It was lesser in the open group (133 +/- 70 ml/ case) compared to laparoscopic group (173 +/- 123 ml / case) although the difference was not statistically significant [P=0.25] (<LINK REF="STD-Milsom-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Milsom 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>Size of the surgical incision used for laparoscopic surgery is usually smaller compared to open surgery. As a result the patients in the laparoscopic group are expected to experience less post operative pain and decreased need for the opioid analgesics. This in turn should help in early mobilisation after surgery possibly contributing to earlier discharge from the hospital. However, there was no significant difference in the amount of opioids used amongst the two groups in the included studies [P= 0.15 <LINK REF="STD-Maartense-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Maartense 2006</LINK> and P=0.57 <LINK REF="STD-Milsom-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Milsom 2001</LINK>]. Postoperative hospital stay was lower in the laparoscopic group compared to open group but the difference was not statistically significant [P=0.90].<BR/>
<BR/>Conversion rates were similar in both the trials [3 out of 30 in <LINK REF="STD-Maartense-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Maartense 2006</LINK> and 2 out of 33 in <LINK REF="STD-Milsom-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Milsom 2001</LINK>]. However, it was interesting to note that Milsom et al have performed a diagnostic laparoscopy for all their patients to assess if the candidate was suitable for laparoscopic surgery or otherwise. Conversions were not included in the data analysis. Maartensee et al have not performed diagnostic laparoscopy and have treated conversions on intention-to-treat basis.</P>
<P>There are concerns about missing the sites of disease on laparoscopic surgery and reduced immunity contributing to higher long term disease recurrence rates. However, there was no significant difference in the reoperation rates for disease recurrence.</P>
<P>Laparoscopic surgery for abdominal conditions is known to have associated with lesser incidence of adhesions and the incisional hernias. In the current review the numbers were less in the laparoscopic group (3/57 vs 7/54) but the difference was not statistically significant (P=0.19).</P>
<P>The main drawback of this study was small patient population and it was difficult to make reliable conclusions. Quality of Life (QoL), an important measure of long term outcome, was not reviewed although one of the RCTs (<LINK REF="STD-Eshusis-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Eshusis 2010</LINK>) reported similar QoL in both the groups.</P>

<P>Laparoscopic surgery for small bowel CD is feasible and may be as safe as open surgery. There are no potential benefits of laparoscopic surgery over open surgery in the management of small bowel CD.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2010-12-01 04:25:30 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>More RCTs with larger patient groups are recommended to obtain conclusive evidence. QoL is an important measure of post operative outcome in CD patients but it is not reported in all the studies. It might therefore be useful to standardise the outcome measures that need reported in future RCTs and reviews.</P>
