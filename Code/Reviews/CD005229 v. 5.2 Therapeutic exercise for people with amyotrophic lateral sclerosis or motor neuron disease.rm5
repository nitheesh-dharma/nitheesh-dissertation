<P>Muscle weakness is very common in people with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), which is also known as motor neuron disease (MND). A weak muscle can be damaged if overworked because it is already functioning close to its maximal limits. Because of this, some experts have discouraged exercise programs for people with ALS. However, if a person with ALS is not active, deconditioning (loss of muscle performance) and weakness from lack of use occurs, on top of the deconditioning and weakness caused by the disease itself. If the reduced level of activity persists, many organ systems can be affected and a person with ALS can develop further deconditioning and muscle weakness, and muscle and joint tightness may occur leading to contractures (abnormal distortion and shortening of muscles) and pain. These all make daily activities harder to do. This review found only two randomised studies of exercise in people with ALS. The trials compared an exercise program with usual care (stretching exercises). Combining the results from the two trials (43 participants), exercise produced a greater average improvement in function (measured using an ALS-specific measurement scale) than usual care. There were no other differences between the two groups. There were no reported adverse events due to exercise. The studies were too small to determine to what extent exercise for people with ALS is beneficial or whether exercise is harmful. We found no new trials when we updated the searches in 2012. More research is needed.</P>

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2013-02-11 14:32:44 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Angela Gunn">
<P>We searched The Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group Specialized Register (2 July 2012), CENTRAL (2012, Issue 6 in The Cochrane Library), MEDLINE (January 1966 to June 2012), EMBASE (January 1980 to June 2012), AMED (January 1985 to June 2012), CINAHL Plus (January 1938 to June 2012), LILACS (January 1982 to June 2012), Ovid HealthSTAR (January 1975 to December 2012). We also searched ProQuest Dissertations &amp; Theses A&amp;I (2007 to 2012), inspected the reference lists of all papers selected for review and contacted authors with expertise in the field.<BR/>

<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2013-02-11 14:32:58 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Ruth Brassington">
<P>We included randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials of people with a diagnosis of definite, probable, probable with laboratory support, or possible ALS, as defined by the El Escorial criteria. We included progressive resistance or strengthening exercise, and endurance or aerobic exercise. The control condition was no exercise or standard rehabilitation management. Our primary outcome measure was improvement in functional ability, decrease in disability or reduction in rate of decline as measured by a validated outcome tool at three months. Our secondary outcome measures were improvement in psychological status or quality of life, decrease in fatigue, increase in, or reduction in rate of decline of muscle strength (strengthening or resistance studies), increase in, or reduction in rate of decline of aerobic endurance (aerobic or endurance studies) at three months and frequency of adverse effects. We did not exclude studies on the basis of measurement of outcomes.<BR/>

<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2013-02-11 14:33:02 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Ruth Brassington">
<P>Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted the data. We collected adverse event data from included trials. The review authors contacted the authors of the included studies to obtain information not available in the published articles.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-02-26 15:00:11 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Ruth Brassington">
<P>We identified two randomised controlled trials that met our inclusion criteria, and we found no new trials when we updated the searches in 2012. The first, a study with overall unclear risk of bias, examined the effects of a twice-daily exercise program of moderate load endurance exercise versus "usual activities" in 25 people with ALS. The second, a study with overall low risk of bias, examined the effects of thrice weekly moderate load and moderate intensity resistance exercises compared to usual care (stretching exercises) in 27 people with ALS. After three months, when the results of the two trials were combined (43 participants), there was a significant mean improvement in the Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Functional Rating Scale (ALSFRS) measure of function in favour of the exercise groups (mean difference 3.21, 95% confidence interval 0.46 to 5.96). No statistically significant differences in quality of life, fatigue or muscle strength were found. In both trials adverse effects, investigators reported no adverse effects such as increased muscle cramping, muscle soreness or fatigue</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2013-02-11 16:33:27 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Motor neuron diseases (MND) include a heterogeneous spectrum of inherited and sporadic clinical disorders of the upper motor neurons (UMN), lower motor neurons (LMN) or a combination of both (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>). MND are characterized by progressive degeneration and loss of motor neurons in the spinal cord, brain stem, or motor cortex, and manifest clinically as muscle weakness, atrophy, and corticospinal tract signs and symptoms in various combinations (<LINK REF="REF-Rowland-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rowland 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Swash-2000a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Swash 2000a</LINK>).</P>
<P>Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is the most common, disabling, and fatal motor neuron disease among adults. Except in a very few geographic areas, worldwide annual incidence rates have been reported to be 0.4 to 2.4 cases per 100,000, with the incidence increasing with each decade of life, until at least the seventh decade. Prevalence rates of ALS are 4 to 10 cases per 100,000 (<LINK REF="REF-Gubbay-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gubbay 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Haverkamp-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haverkamp 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Norris-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Norris 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pradas-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pradas 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ringel-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ringel 1993</LINK>), and in 5% to 10% of individuals the disease is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait, familial ALS (FALS) (<LINK REF="REF-Mulder-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mulder 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Strong-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Strong 1991</LINK>). Rare cases of juvenile onset ALS are inherited in an autosomal recessive or dominant pattern (<LINK REF="REF-Hamida-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hamida 2000</LINK>). The most frequent presenting impairment is focal, asymmetrical weakness beginning in the upper or lower extremity or weakness in the bulbar muscles (<LINK REF="REF-Gubbay-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gubbay 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Norris-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Norris 1993</LINK>). Muscle weakness is considered the cardinal sign of ALS. Initial muscle weakness usually occurs in isolated muscles, most often distally, and is followed by progressive weakness and functional limitations (<LINK REF="REF-Mitsumoto-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mitsumoto 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Swash-2000b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Swash 2000b</LINK>).</P>
<P>Despite the high incidence of muscle weakness in individuals with ALS or MND, the effects of exercise are not well understood. In individuals with ALS or MND, the safe range for therapeutic exercise may be narrowed. It is postulated that a weak muscle is more susceptible to overwork damage, because it is already functioning close to its maximal limits (<LINK REF="REF-Coble-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Coble 1985</LINK>). In the past, some experts have discouraged exercise programs because of fear of overuse weakness, and have suggested that no exercise other than everyday activities is indicated (<LINK REF="REF-Sinaki-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sinaki 1978</LINK>). The possibility of inducing overwork damage in individuals with ALS or MND through excessive exercise or strengthening exercises is a concern. For example, it has been reported that highly repetitive or heavy resistance exercise can cause prolonged loss of muscle strength in weakened or denervated muscle (<LINK REF="REF-Bennett-1958" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bennett 1958</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Johnson-1971" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnson 1971</LINK>), and epidemiologic data showing a higher incidence of ALS in people performing intense physical activity at work or for leisure before disease onset have led some clinicians to caution against exercise for people with ALS (<LINK REF="REF-Kurtzke-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kurtzke 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Strickland-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Strickland 1996</LINK>). However, studies of individuals with other neuromuscular diseases have found that exercise programs are beneficial and did not produce overuse weakness (<LINK REF="REF-Aitkens-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aitkens 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Einarsson-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Einarsson 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Florence-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Florence 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kilmer-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kilmer 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lindeman-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lindeman 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McCartney-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">McCartney 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Milner_x002d_Brown-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Milner-Brown 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vignos-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vignos 1983</LINK>).</P>
<P>Three animal studies have reported that endurance exercise training at moderate intensities slowed disease progression in superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) transgenic mice (<LINK REF="REF-Kaspar-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kaspar 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kirkinezos-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kirkinezos 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Veldink-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Veldink 2003</LINK>). However, a fourth study found that high endurance exercise training had detrimental effects in male mice (<LINK REF="REF-Mahoney-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mahoney 2004</LINK>). Kirkinezos and colleagues demonstrated that treadmill running five days a week at 13 m/min led to a significant increase in the life span of G93A-SOD1 male mice. There was a trend toward increased female mice life span, but the increase was not significant (<LINK REF="REF-Kirkinezos-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kirkinezos 2003</LINK>). Veldink and colleagues found that treadmill running at 16 m/min significantly delayed onset and prolonged survival in transgenic low-copy hSOD1 female but not male mice (<LINK REF="REF-Veldink-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Veldink 2003</LINK>). The benefits of exercise were most pronounced in the study by Kaspar and colleagues: SOD1 transgenic mice who were exposed to an exercise wheel six hours per day beginning in the presymptomatic state survived 33% longer (163 days versus 122 days) than those not exposed to a running wheel (<LINK REF="REF-Kaspar-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kaspar 2005</LINK>). Conversely, high-intensity treadmill training at 22 m/min was found to not affect onset of disease in G93A-SOD1 male and female mice. However, the exercise was found to hasten death in male, but not female mice (<LINK REF="REF-Mahoney-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mahoney 2004</LINK>). More recently, two types of exercise using the SOD1 mouse model were compared: swimming-based, high-frequency and high-amplitude exercise versus running. The swimming group maintained constant body weight longer during disease progression, exhibited sustained motor function, and had a 20% increase in life span (<LINK REF="REF-Deforges-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deforges 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>A marked reduction in activity level secondary to ALS or MND can lead to cardiovascular deconditioning and disuse weakness, superimposed on the weakness caused by the disease itself. Reduced physical activity, particularly if prolonged, produces muscle atrophy, reduced strength of tendons and ligaments, and osteoporosis. Strength loss through inactivity and disuse may significantly debilitate individuals with ALS or MND, making them susceptible to deconditioning, and muscle and joint tightness which lead to contractures and pain. Exercise programs might have positive physiological and psychological effects for people with ALS or MND, especially when implemented before significant muscular atrophy occurs. As new drugs to slow the progression of ALS or MND become available, people may live longer. Interventions such as exercise, that minimize impairments, maximize function and improve quality of life, will become increasingly important. This review was first published in 2008 and this update was completed in 2012.</P>

<P>We immediately excluded all but two papers because they did not report a RCT or quasi-RCT (that is to say, they were a case report, or a descriptive paper about exercise or management of people with ALS or MND, et cetera). The two included RCTs are described in <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK> and the findings are summarized in <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>.</P>
<P>The first included study (<LINK REF="STD-Drory-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Drory 2001</LINK>) evaluated the benefits of a 15 min, twice-daily exercise program in people with early and middle stage ALS. The exercise program was described as individualized (based on general health, neurologic status and fitness level), moderate load, endurance type exercises for the limbs and trunk, but no specific details about the exercise protocol were provided. All participants met the diagnosis of definite or probable ALS, as defined by the El Escorial criteria. Fourteen people were randomised into the exercise group and were compared to 11 people who were instructed to continue with usual activities of daily living. The individualized exercise program was prescribed by a physical therapist, demonstrated, written down and reviewed at each clinic visit. Changes in the exercise protocol were made at each clinic visit based on changes in status. Every 14 days, people in both groups were contacted by telephone. The purpose of the telephone call for the exercise group was to check adherence to prevent drop-out. The participants in the control group were asked how they were, if they had any problems with swallowing or breathing, et cetera.</P>
<P>The second included study (<LINK REF="STD-Dal-Bello_x002d_Haas-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Dal Bello-Haas 2007</LINK>) compared a thrice weekly resistance exercise program to daily stretching stretching exercises in people with early stage ALS. All participants met the definite, probable or probable with laboratory support ALS El Escorial criteria, and 13 were randomised into a resistance group who completed daily upper and lower extremity stretching exercises and resistance exercises three times per week. The resistance exercise program consisted of individualized (based on limitations and tolerance), progressive, moderate load and moderate intensity upper and lower extremity exercises. Fourteen were randomized into a usual care group and were instructed to complete daily stretching exercises only. For both groups, exercises were prescribed by a physical therapist unblinded to group assignment, demonstrated to the participants, written down and reviewed and revised as needed at each monthly clinic visit. Participants were asked to complete exercise logs and to note whether they exercised, what exercises they completed and if they noticed any adverse effects. Participants were also telephoned every two weeks, interviewed at the monthly clinic visit by the unblinded physical therapist and were asked about compliance and adverse effects.</P>
<P>In both studies, functional ability was measured with the ALSFRS (<LINK REF="REF-CNTF-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">CNTF 1996</LINK>); the Short Form-36 Health Survey (SF-36) (<LINK REF="REF-Ware-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ware 1993</LINK>) was used to measure quality of life; and fatigue was measured using the Fatigue Severity Scale (<LINK REF="REF-Krupp-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Krupp 1989</LINK>). In the <LINK REF="STD-Drory-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Drory 2001</LINK> study, muscle strength was measured using manual muscle strength testing (MMT), using the zero to five MRC scale. Five muscle groups in each limb were tested (shoulder abduction, elbow flexion and extension, finger abduction and extension, hip flexion, knee flexion and extension, dorsiflexion and plantarflexion) and MMT scores were added. In addition, spasticity and pain were measured using validated measures, but are not reported. Changes in muscle strength were monitored as a safety outcome using upper and lower extremity MVIC in the <LINK REF="STD-Dal-Bello_x002d_Haas-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Dal Bello-Haas 2007</LINK> study.

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2013-02-26 15:23:43 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Only two identified studies on the effects of exercise in people with ALS or MND met the inclusion criteria. The risk of bias of one study was judged as unclear overall (no allocation concealment, the evaluator assessing the outcome measures was not blinded) and the other as at low risk of bias. The MD in the primary outcome, function as measured by the ALSFRS, was statistically significant, while MDs in secondary outcome measures between groups were non-significant. Both studies followed participants beyond three months, <LINK REF="STD-Drory-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Drory 2001</LINK> for 12 months and <LINK REF="STD-Dal-Bello_x002d_Haas-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Dal Bello-Haas 2007</LINK> for six months. <LINK REF="STD-Drory-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Drory 2001</LINK> reported no differences between groups at six months, although there was a trend toward less deterioration in most outcome measures. <LINK REF="STD-Dal-Bello_x002d_Haas-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Dal Bello-Haas 2007</LINK> reported higher ALSFRS and SF-36 physical function subscale scores in the treatment group at six months. Rate of drop-outs continued to increase over time in both studies. In the <LINK REF="STD-Drory-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Drory 2001</LINK> study, so few participants remained in the study at nine and 12 months that analyses could not be completed.</P>
<P>In both trials adverse effects, such as increased muscle cramping, muscle soreness or fatigue, were not reported by the investigators. In the <LINK REF="STD-Dal-Bello_x002d_Haas-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Dal Bello-Haas 2007</LINK>, one participant discontinued the study because of bypass surgery. The participant had a history of cardiac problems (hypercholesterolemia and hypertension controlled with medications, previous myocardial infarction), and was informed of a blockage but surgery was not performed at that time. The participant was being followed by a cardiologist and was given initial clearance by the cardiologist to participate in the ALS exercise trial. Although not statistically significant, MDs in MMT scores favoured the control group in the <LINK REF="STD-Drory-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Drory 2001</LINK> study, but the lower extremity MVIC scores favoured the treatment group in the <LINK REF="STD-Dal-Bello_x002d_Haas-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Dal Bello-Haas 2007</LINK> study. In <LINK REF="STD-Drory-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Drory 2001</LINK>, from baseline to month three, participants in the exercise group had a mean change of -0.33 in FSS scores compared to a mean change of +18.0 in the control group, indicating less fatigue in the exercise group. Similarily, from baseline to month three, participants in the exercise group had a mean change of -0.25 in muscle pain scores compared to a mean change of +1.8 in the control group, indicating less muscle pain. Thus, whether the MMT findings (<LINK REF="STD-Drory-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Drory 2001</LINK>) represent overwork weakness cannot be determined.</P>
<P>The dearth of research highlights the need for further investigation in this area. Only two trials examining the effect of exercise in people with ALS met the inclusion criteria and were included. Several factors regarding the disease, the population and type of intervention may be responsible for this finding. First, despite the relatively high prevalence of muscle weakness in people with ALS, the rapidly progressive nature of the disease makes recruitment to trials with large numbers difficult. Currently, there is no cure for ALS and about 50% of people die within two to three years after diagnosis (<LINK REF="REF-Norris-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Norris 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ringel-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ringel 1993</LINK>). It is logical to expect that people with ALS would prefer to choose to be randomised into a disease-modifying pharmaceutical trial. Thus, the willingness of participants to be randomly allocated into an exercise trial, as opposed to a trial that might slow disease progression, is a particularly important issue. Second, ALS is highly variable from person to person. The extent and areas of disease involvement, the stage and severity of illness, the rate of disease progression, and the severity of respiratory and bulbar manifestations can all affect enrollment and continued participation with the intervention. Third, the motivation and commitment of individual participants to undertake the exercise component alone or with the assistance of a caregiver, in the face of continued physical and emotional loss and uncertainty may deter some from agreeing to participate, and contribute to high drop-out rates.</P>
<P>Current clinical management for people with ALS is predominantly individualized rehabilitation that may or may not include strengthening or aerobic exercise prescription. The continued lack of robust evidence regarding the efficacy and benefits of exercise in people with ALS may influence the availability, accessibility and quality of rehabilitation services provided for this group. Exercise, when prescribed appropriately, may be physically and psychologically important for people with ALS, especially in the earlier stages of the disease and before significant muscular atrophy or deconditioning occurs. Although exercise may not improve the strength of muscles already weakened by ALS, strengthening exercises with low to moderate weights, and aerobic exercises such as swimming, walking, and bicycling, at submaximal levels may be important components of an overall management plan.</P>
<P>We did find some non-randomised literature. Two early case studies reported positive effects of specific strengthening and endurance exercises in individuals with ALS (<LINK REF="REF-Bohannon-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bohannon 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sanjak-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sanjak 1987</LINK>), and Pinto and colleagues reported that people who participated in endurance exercises while on BiPAP had significantly greater Functional Impact Measure scores, slower Spinal Norris Score decline and less FVC decline compared to those who did not exercise (<LINK REF="REF-Pinto-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pinto 1999</LINK>). Animal model studies suggest that although high intensity endurance exercise may be detrimental, low or moderate intensity endurance exercise may be of some benefit (<LINK REF="REF-Kirkinezos-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kirkinezos 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mahoney-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mahoney 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Veldink-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Veldink 2003</LINK>), and a Cochrane review has found that in people with neuromuscular disorders, specifically myotonic dystrophy and facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy, moderate-intensity strength training appeared not to be harmful (<LINK REF="REF-van-der-Kooi-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">van der Kooi 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>Despite the lack of sufficient and adequate research evidence, some discourage strengthening or aerobic exercise programs for people with ALS because of fear of overuse weakness and believe that no exercise other than everyday activities is indicated. In people with ALS, the safe range for therapeutic exercise narrows. The degree to which this safe range narrows is dependent on the extent of disease involvement and the rate of disease progression. A weak or denervated muscle is more susceptible to overwork damage because it is already functioning close to its maximal limits. Activities of daily living alone may provide a training stimulus to weak muscles, and additional exercise that would strengthen healthy muscles may actually cause overwork damage. The remaining motor units will respond to training, and these motor units must work harder to handle a given amount of exercise stress. Thus, the possibility of inducing overwork damage in individuals with ALS through excessive exercise is a concern. On the other hand, a marked reduction in activity level secondary to ALS can lead to cardiovascular deconditioning and disuse weakness beyond the amount caused by the disease itself. Reduced physical activity, particularly if prolonged, reduces function of the neuromuscular system, in addition to the skeletal and other organ systems. With insufficient activity, disuse atrophy develops because the strength of muscle contractions are less than the total tension a muscle is capable of producing, and as contractile proteins are lost, muscle weakness progresses. Strength loss through inactivity and disuse can significantly debilitate individuals with ALS, making them highly susceptible to cardiovascular deconditioning, and muscle and joint tightness that lead to contractures and pain. Thus, special attention is needed when designing a strengthening or aerobic exercise program for a person with ALS: the balance between prevention of overuse fatigue and weakness and disuse atrophy must be taken into consideration.</P>
<P>The lack of substantial evidence regarding the role of exercise in people with ALS supports the need to develop future, high quality, sufficiently powered trials. At present, many questions related to the role of exercise and ALS remain unanswered, including: (1) which people would benefit most from strengthening or aerobic exercise; (2) when is the most appropriate time to initiate exercise in people with ALS; (3) what degree of disease involvement or disease progression would supercede any beneficial effects of exercise; (4) what is the most appropriate type of exercise for people with ALS; (5) what are the most appropriate exercise parameters and protocols; (6) what occurs at the physiologic level when people with ALS exercise. In addition, until relevant research evidence about the effects of exercise is available, the impact of exercise on the overall economic burden of care cannot be considered. Cost-benefit analyses are only relevant if the benefit of exercise has been demonstrated.</P>
<P>Considering the nature of ALS and the controversy surrounding exercise and ALS, it is critical that future research designs include:</P>
<OL>
<LI>Compatible groups: specific diagnostic criteria should be provided for all participants included in trials. The range of disease severity, and severity of impairments and function should be noted to allow readers to assess the generalizability of the results to their patient or patient group. Group participants should be stratified or matched for disease severity.</LI>
<LI>Adequate allocation concealment.</LI>
<LI>Blinding of the outcome assessor.</LI>
<LI>A clear description of the exercise intervention, including the mode of exercise, intensity, progression, frequency, duration per exercise session, duration of the entire programme, muscle groups exercised, supervision of exercise protocol, and compliance assessment.</LI>
<LI>Level of activity at baseline.</LI>
<LI>Monitoring of adverse events and reporting of reasons for drop-out.</LI>
<LI>Standardized outcome measures: well validated outcome measures that are able to assess positive and negative effects of exercise should be utilized, including measures of muscle function or aerobic capacity, function, fatigue and quality of life.</LI>
</OL>

<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2013-02-11 14:36:56 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Ruth Brassington">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>Two studies were included but were too small to determine to what extent strengthening exercises for people with ALS are beneficial. Currently, there is a complete lack of randomised or quasi-randomised clinical trials examining aerobic exercise in people with ALS. </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2013-02-11 14:36:56 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Ruth Brassington">
<P>More research is needed to elucidate whether strengthening or aerobic exercise is beneficial or harmful in people with ALS. Well-controlled studies are needed to determine the ideal exercise prescription for people with ALS, in terms of both which exercise protocols are most beneficial or cause undue risks, and whether there is a sub-set of people with ALS who respond more positively to exercise, both physically and psychologically.</P>
