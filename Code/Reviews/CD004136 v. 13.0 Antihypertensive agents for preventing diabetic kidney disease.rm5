<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2012-11-01 17:47:28 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Many people with diabetes (around 20% to 60%) are are affected by high blood pressure (hypertension) and need drugs (antihypertensive agents) to treat this condition. These drugs also help to prevent development of kidney disease both in people with diabetes who have normal blood pressure and those whose blood pressure is high. Many people with diabetic kidney disease (DKD) (20% to 40%) go on to develop end-stage kidney disease (ESKD), and many others die from heart disease or other circulatory problems before ESKD develops.</P>
<P>We reviewed the literature to determine the benefits and harms of antihypertensive treatment in people with diabetes who did not have signs of kidney disease. We found 26 studies involving 61,264 participants that compared antihypertensive drugs with placebo (an neutral agent with no therapeutic benefits or harms), no treatment, and other antihypertensive drugs. A family of drugs called ACEi (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors) has been shown to prevent new onset of kidney disease and reduce the numbers of deaths in people with diabetes who have normal levels of albumin in their urine compared with placebo or calcium channel blocking drugs. We found no significant effect from angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) drugs on either development of ESKD or death.</P>
<P>Subgroup analyses that suggested similar benefits from ARB for people with type 2 diabetes who were at high risk of heart disease or should be interpreted cautiously. Direct comparison of ACEi and ARB in this population showed no difference in preventing DKD. The benefits of ACEi are consistent, and ACEi could be the first choice intervention for primary prevention of DKD.</P>

<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2012-10-17 16:11:24 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<P>Two investigators independently extracted data on kidney and other patient-relevant outcomes (all-cause mortality and serious cardiovascular events), and assessed study quality.

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-11-08 16:57:27 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We identified 26 studies that enrolling 61,264 participants. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) reduced the risk of new onset of microalbuminuria, macroalbuminuria or both when compared to placebo (8 studies, 11,906 patients: RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.56 to 0.89), with similar benefits in people with and without hypertension (P = 0.74), and when compared to calcium channel blockers (5 studies, 1253 participants: RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.42 to 0.85). ACEi reduced the risk of death when compared to placebo (6 studies, 11,350 participants: RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.73 to 0.97). No effect was observed for angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) when compared to placebo for new microalbuminuria, macroalbuminuria or both (5 studies, 7653 participants: RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.19) or death (5 studies, 7653 participants: RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.41); however, meta-regression suggested possible benefits from ARB for preventing kidney disease in high risk patients. There was a trend towards benefit from use of combined ACEi and ARB for prevention of DKD compared with ACEi alone (2 studies, 4171 participants: RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.00).The risk of cough was significantly increased with ACEi when compared to placebo (6 studies, 11,791 patients: RR 1.84, 95% CI 1.24 to 2.72), however there was no significant difference in the risk of headache or hyperkalaemia. There was no significant difference in the risk of cough, headache or hyperkalaemia when ARB was to placebo. On average risk of bias was judged to be either low (27% to 69%) or unclear (i.e. no information available) (8% to 73%). Blinding of participants, incomplete outcome data and selective reporting were judged to be high in 23%, 31% and 31% of studies, respectively.</P>

<P>ACEi were found to prevent new onset DKD and death in normoalbuminuric people with diabetes, and could therefore be used in this population. More data are needed to clarify the role of ARB and other drug classes in preventing DKD.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2012-10-18 18:13:33 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2012-10-17 16:02:05 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Ann Jones">
<P>Diabetes is a major global epidemic and responsible for most diagnoses of end-stage kidney disease (ESKD). Diabetes is also a major cause of death in many countries (<LINK REF="REF-IDF-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">IDF 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-USRDS-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">USRDS 2009</LINK>). Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) (also called diabetic nephropathy) develops slowly, and the first clinically-evident feature of kidney involvement is often development of microalbuminuria (urinary albumin excretion &gt; 30 mg/d). DKD occurs in 20% to 40% of patients within 10 to 15 years of diabetes onset and typically progresses to macroalbuminuria before kidney function starts to decline. Micro- and macroalbuminuria are both risk factors for kidney failure, cardiovascular disease and death (<LINK REF="REF-Ninomiya-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ninomiya 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ritz-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ritz 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ruggenenti-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ruggenenti 1997</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2012-10-17 16:13:07 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Ann Jones">
<P>Hypertension and proteinuria contribute to a progressive deterioration of kidney function in patients with DKD (<LINK REF="REF-Hasslacher-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hasslacher 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mogensen-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mogensen 1976</LINK>) and most antihypertensive agents are used both for the treatment of hypertension and in an effort to slow the progression of kidney damage in patients with DKD. Antihypertensive agents used in this scenario include angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi), angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB), calcium channel blockers (CCBs), beta-blockers and diuretics. These have been used both alone or in combination.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2012-10-18 18:13:33 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Ann Jones">
<P>For patients with established DKD, inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) have been shown to retard progressive kidney impairment and prevent ESKD onset (<LINK REF="REF-Strippoli-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Strippoli 2004</LINK>). Based on data from completed studies, most guideline groups have recommended the use of ACEi or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) equally in patients who have diabetes with micro- or macroalbuminuria, interchangeably (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2012-10-17 16:06:12 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Ann Jones">
<P>Our original review suggested that ACEi may reduce the risk of nephropathy developing in normoalbuminuric patients with diabetes (<LINK REF="REF-Strippoli-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Strippoli 2005</LINK>). However, relatively few data were available about the effects of other classes of antihypertensives at that time, which contributed to some persisting uncertainty. A number of new studies have examined the efficacy of blood pressure lowering for the primary prevention of DKD, albeit with conflicting results (<LINK REF="STD-ADVANCE-Study-2009" TYPE="STUDY">ADVANCE Study 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-DIRECT-Studies-2009" TYPE="STUDY">DIRECT Studies 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-RASS-Study-2002" TYPE="STUDY">RASS Study 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-TRANSCEND-Study-2009" TYPE="STUDY">TRANSCEND Study 2009</LINK>). This updated systematic review was therefore undertaken to evaluate the relative effects of blood pressure lowering agents on the primary prevention of new-onset kidney disease in patients who have diabetes.</P>

<STUDY_SELECTION MODIFIED="2012-10-17 17:03:40 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Ann Jones">
<P>Two authors (original review GFMS, MC; review update JL, CF) undertook selection of studies. Authors independently assessed retrieved abstracts, and wherever necessary the full text of studies, to determine which satisfied the inclusion criteria. Disagreements were resolved in all cases by discussion among author teams.</P>

<DATA_EXTRACTION MODIFIED="2012-10-17 17:07:45 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Ann Jones">
<P>Data extraction was carried out by the same authors independently using standard data extraction forms. It was planned that any studies reported in non-English language journals would be translated before assessment. Where more than one report of one study existed, the reports were grouped together and the report with most complete data was used in the analyses. Where relevant outcomes were only published in other reports these data was used.</P>

<EFFECT_MEASURES MODIFIED="2012-10-17 17:08:47 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Ann Jones">
<P>Data entry was carried out by two authors (original review GFMS, MC; review update: JL, CF). For dichotomous outcomes results were expressed as risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Where continuous scales of measurement were used to assess the effects of treatment (microalbuminuria, blood pressure) the mean difference (MD) was used.</P>

<HETEROGENEITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2012-03-14 12:56:30 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Ann Jones">
<P>Heterogeneity was analysed using a Chi test on N-1 degrees of freedom, with an alpha of 0.05 used for statistical significance and with the I test (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2003</LINK>). I values of 25%, 50% and 75% correspond to low, medium and high levels of heterogeneity.</P>

<BIAS_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2012-10-31 18:23:52 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Ann Jones">
<P>It was planned that if sufficient RCTs were identified, an attempt would be made to examine for publication bias using a funnel plot (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). It was also planned that when different treatment options had not been compared directly within available RCTs, conclusions on relative efficacy would be based on indirect comparisons where applicable (<LINK REF="REF-Bucher-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bucher 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Song-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Song 2000</LINK>).

<DATA_SYNTHESIS MODIFIED="2012-10-17 16:36:47 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Ann Jones">
<P>Data were pooled using the random-effects model but the fixed-effect model was also used to investigate robustness of the model chosen and susceptibility to outliers.</P>
</DATA_SYNTHESIS>
<SUBGROUP_ANALYSIS MODIFIED="2012-10-17 16:37:09 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Ann Jones">
<P>Subgroup analyses were used to explore possible sources of heterogeneity. Heterogeneity among participants could be related to age, baseline presence or absence of hypertension, renal pathology and glycaemic control. Heterogeneity in treatments could be related to dose and duration of therapies administered to study participants. These aspects were analysed and tabulated or computed whenever applicable. Adverse effects were tabulated and assessed using descriptive techniques because of differences among the various agents investigated. Where possible, the risk difference with 95% CI was calculated for each adverse effect, either compared with no treatment or another agent.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-10-31 17:39:25 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Ann Jones">
<P>Individuals with diabetes who develop kidney disease are at increased risk of kidney failure, cardiovascular events and death (<LINK REF="REF-Ninomiya-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ninomiya 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Perkovic-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Perkovic 2008</LINK>). Current treatments provide modest benefits once kidney diease is established, so primary prevention has been the focus of much attention in recent years (<LINK REF="STD-DIRECT-Studies-2009" TYPE="STUDY">DIRECT Studies 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-RASS-Study-2002" TYPE="STUDY">RASS Study 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-ROADMAP-Study-2009" TYPE="STUDY">ROADMAP Study 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Parfrey-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parfrey 2009</LINK>). This updated systematic review has several times more data than a previous analysis, and has shown that ACEi reduced the risk of new onset kidney disease by 29% and the risk of death by 16% in people with diabetes. Clear renal benefits were observed among individuals without hypertension at baseline, and in comparison to CCBs. These effects are also consistent across a broad spectrum of people with diabetes, including individuals with type 1 or type 2 diabetes, with or without hypertension, and in placebo controlled studies or those comparing ACEi to other blood pressure agents. Other studies have suggested ACEi also prevent new onset diabetic retinopathy in patients without albuminuria (<LINK REF="STD-EUCLID-Study-1997" TYPE="STUDY">EUCLID Study 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-RASS-Study-2002" TYPE="STUDY">RASS Study 2002</LINK>). In contrast we were unable demonstrate similar overall benefits for ARB overall, although it remains possible that benefits may be present for high risk individuals. These results suggest that ACEi could be routinely considered for the primary prevention of microvascular disease and death in people with diabetes regardless of blood pressure levels, although further study is needed to evaluate the cost effectiveness of this approach.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2012-10-31 17:38:32 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Ann Jones">
<P>The main limitation of this study was that the effects of blood pressure lowering agents on ESKD could not be ascertained, possibly due to the slowly progressive nature of DKD, and the resultant low incidence of ESKD in the population. As the use of ACEi in this population also reduced the risk of death from any cause, the impact of this limitation for this drug class is likely to be modest. It has been generally accepted that the onset of albuminuria precedes kidney failure and is thus a reliable sign of DKD, but this notion has been challenged by reports of diabetic patients with decreased renal function but without albuminuria (<LINK REF="STD-DIRECT-Studies-2009" TYPE="STUDY">DIRECT Studies 2009</LINK>). Although observational studies show a strong and graded relationship between albuminuria levels and the risk of decreasing GFR and the development of kidney failure (<LINK REF="REF-Adler-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Adler 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gerstein-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gerstein 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Messent-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Messent 1992</LINK>). The available clinical studies have not demonstrated that preventing microalbuminuria will necessarily lead to reductions in kidney failure. This is mainly a result of the slow rate of decline in kidney function in diabetes, meaning that very long follow up would be required in people with diabetes and normoalbuminuria (<LINK REF="REF-Levey-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Levey 2009</LINK>). Further study is needed to confirm whether the prevention of microalbuminuria would lead to fewer kidney failure or cardiovascular events (<LINK REF="REF-Klausen-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Klausen 2004</LINK>).</P>
</POTENTIAL_BIASES>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2012-10-31 17:39:51 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Ann Jones">
<P>ACEi and ARB have been recommended interchangeably in most guidelines for the treatment of people with diabetes (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>).The available data, summarized in this review, suggest that the benefits of ACEi for the prevention of DKD as well as death were clear, while as for ARB no clear effects on mortality was observed and renal benefits were only found in subgroup analyses. ACEi were also superior to calcium channel blockers in head to head comparisons, but little data was available for other drug classes. Studies in people with DKD have identified clear benefit for ARB in the prevention of ESKD, but have similarly failed to show any benefit for cardiovascular outcomes or death (<LINK REF="REF-Strippoli-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Strippoli 2004</LINK>).Other studies have also demonstrated consistent preventive effects of ARB on diabetic retinopathy (<LINK REF="REF-Chaturvedi-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chaturvedi 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-RASS-Study-2002" TYPE="STUDY">RASS Study 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sj_x00f8_lie-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sjlie 2008</LINK>). Caution is required in interpreting potential differences in the effects of ACEi and ARB. Most ARB studies (<LINK REF="STD-DIRECT-Studies-2009" TYPE="STUDY">DIRECT Studies 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-RASS-Study-2002" TYPE="STUDY">RASS Study 2002</LINK>) in this meta-analysis recruited mainly normotensive patients at low renal and vascular risk, so event rates were modest limiting study power. Metaregression also identified baseline renal and cardiovascular risk as a significant effect modifier for ARB in the prevention of kidney disease, with evidence of benefit in high risk individuals that was similar in magnitude to that reported for ACEi. The likelihood of similar effects of the two classes is further supported by the results of the large <LINK REF="STD-ONTARGET-Study-2008" TYPE="STUDY">ONTARGET Study 2008</LINK> in which a head-to-head comparison demonstrated that ARB and ACEi were equivalent for the prevention of DKD in individuals at high cardiovascular risk, and that also suggested additional benefit for new onset albuminuria when the two classes of drugs were combined (<LINK REF="STD-ONTARGET-Study-2008" TYPE="STUDY">ONTARGET Study 2008</LINK>). The consistency of effect demonstrated for ACEi, as well as the clear mortality benefits observed, suggest that these agents should be the first choice for the primary prevention intervention of DKD, while ARB appear a reasonable alternative in high risk individuals who are unable to tolerate ACEi.</P>
<P>Another finding in this meta-analysis was that the benefits for primary prevention of DKD were similar in people with and without hypertension at baseline, so that ACEi were effective even among groups that are considered normotensive. As RAS blockade has already been proven to be effective at preventing ESKD in individuals with established DKD (<LINK REF="REF-Strippoli-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Strippoli 2004</LINK>), these results suggest that ACEi are likely to be beneficial for all individuals with diabetes who are able to tolerate these agents.</P>
<P>Treatment with ACEi could therefore be recommended in normoalbuminuric patients with diabetes for at least two purposes: the primary prevention of kidney disease, as well as reduction in the risk of death in this population. ACEi may be used in preference to ARB based on the stronger data available for this class of agents. If these data are applied to a broad population of people with diabetes, the large excess burden of morbidity and mortality suffered by these individuals may be substantially reduced.</P>

<FEEDBACK_SUMMARY MODIFIED="2012-03-15 14:46:31 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Ann Jones">
<P>There may be an error in the results section on the bottom of page 2. Under Angiotensin Converting Enzyme inhibitors vs. CCBs (comparison 2) it says, "There was no statistically significant difference in the risk of development of kidney disease (micro or macroalbuminuria) outcome 04, four trials, 1210 patients: RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.84) with ACEi compared to calcium channel blockers."</P>
<P>This seems to contradict both the data and the last sentence in the abstract "Compared to CCBs, ACEi significantly reduced progression to microalbuminuria (four trials, 1210 patients: RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.84)."</P>
</FEEDBACK_SUMMARY>
<FEEDBACK_REPLY>
<P>To Dr Kripke and Dr Dressler:<BR/>The statistics are all correct, although the text describing them in the results section is wrong. It should read: "There was a statistically significant reduction in the risk of development of kidney disease (micro or macroalbuminuria)...."</P>
