<P>
<B>Review question</B>
</P>
<P>Is risperidone (tablet form) more effective than placebo in treating the symptoms of schizophrenia or schizophrenia-like illnesses?</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>People with schizophrenia often hear voices and see things (hallucinations) and have strange beliefs (delusions). These are called &#8216;positive symptoms&#8217;. Mental illness also causes tiredness, apathy, emotional numbness, and withdrawal. These are called &#8216;negative symptoms&#8217;. The main treatment for the symptoms of schizophrenia are antipsychotic drugs. Antipsychotic drugs can be classified into typical (older) and atypical (newer) drugs. Typical antipsychotics such as chlorpromazine and haloperidol have been the mainstay of treatment for decades, and have been effective in reducing the positive symptoms of schizophrenia. Negative symptoms, however, have been fairly resistant to treatment. In addition, drug treatments are associated with unpleasant side effects that cause people to stop taking medication, which may lead to relapse. It is thought that newer atypical antipsychotics, such as risperidone, are more effective than the older antipsychotics as they reduce the positive symptoms but cause fewer side effects.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>Searches for high-quality randomised trials were carried out in 2008, 2013 and 2015. The review now includes 15 studies with 2428 participants. The studies randomised participants (in- and outpatients) with schizophrenia or schizophrenia-like illnesses into treatment groups that received oral risperidone or placebo.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>Results from limited data suggest that risperidone is more effective than placebo for reducing the overall symptoms of schizophrenia, and participants receiving risperidone were more likely to comply with treatment. However, like the older typical antipsychotics, risperidone was also associated with serious side effects, such as parkinsonism.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
</P>
<P>The evidence available was very low quality. Information and data were limited, poorly reported, and probably biased in favour of risperidone . Nearly half of the included trials were funded by drug companies. Firm conclusions are difficult to make based on the results of this review. Better conduct and reporting of trials could increase confidence in the results.</P>

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2016-07-08 11:48:35 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>On 19th October 2015, we searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register, which is based on regular searches of CINAHL, BIOSIS, AMED, EMBASE, PubMed, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and registries of clinical trials. We checked the references of all included studies and contacted industry and authors of included studies for relevant studies and data.</P>

<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2015-07-05 21:34:20 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Randomised clinical trials (RCTs) comparing oral risperidone with placebo treatments for people with schizophrenia and/or schizophrenia-like psychoses.</P>

<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2016-07-08 11:21:49 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two review authors independently screened studies, assessed the risk of bias of included studies and extracted data. For dichotomous data, we calculated the risk ratio (RR), and the 95% confidence interval (CI) on an intention-to-treat basis. For continuous data, we calculated mean differences (MD) and the 95% CI. We created a 'Summary of findings table' using <A HREF="http://ims.cochrane.org/gradepro">GRADE</A> (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation).</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-11-22 15:27:09 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The review includes 15 studies (N = 2428). Risk of selection bias is unclear in most of the studies, especially concerning allocation concealment. Other areas of risk such as missing data and selective reporting also caused some concern, although not affected on the direction of effect of our primary outcome, as demonstrated by sensitivity analysis. Many of the included trials have industry sponsorship of involvement. Nonetheless, generally people in the risperidone group are more likely to achieve a significant clinical improvement in mental state (6 RCTs, N = 864, RR 0.64, CI 0.52 to 0.78, <I>very low-quality evidence</I>). The effect withstood, even when three studies with &gt;50% attrition rate were removed from the analysis (3 RCTs, N = 589, RR 0.77, CI 0.67 to 0.88). Participants receiving placebo were less likely to have a clinically significant improvement on Clinical Global Impression scale (CGI) than those receiving risperidone (4 RCTs, N = 594, RR 0.69, CI 0.57 to 0.83, <I>very low-quality evidence</I>). Overall, the risperidone group was 31% less likely to leave early compared to placebo group (12 RCTs, N = 2261, RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.62 to 0.78, <I>low-quality evidence</I>), but Incidence of significant extrapyramidal side effect was more likely to occur in the risperidone group (7 RCTs, N = 1511, RR 1.56, 95% CI 1.13 to 2.15, <I>very low-quality evidence</I>).<BR/>
</P>
<P>When risperidone and placebo were augmented with clozapine, there is no significant differences between groups for clinical response as defined by a less than 20% reduction in PANSS/BPRS scores (2 RCTs, N = 98, RR 1.15, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.42, <I>low-quality evidence)</I> and attrition (leaving the study early for any reason) (3 RCTs, N = 167, RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.53 to 2.42, <I>low quality evidence)</I>. One study measured clinically significant responses using the CGI, no effect was evident (1 RCT, N = 68, RR 1.12 95% CI 0.87 to 1.44, <I>low quality evidence</I>). No data were available for extrapyramidal adverse effects.</P>

<P>Based on low quality evidence, risperidone appears to be benefitial in improving mental state compared with placebo, but it also causes more adverse events.

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2015-07-05 21:43:45 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Risperidone (<LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>) is the first new-generation antipsychotic drug made available in the market in its generic form. It has been used in the treatment of schizophrenia and related psychotic disorders for over a decade.</P>
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2015-07-05 21:43:45 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Schizophrenia is a serious, chronic, and relapsing mental illness with a worldwide lifetime prevalence of about 1%. It is characterised by positive symptoms such as hallucinations and delusions, and negative symptoms such as emotional numbness and withdrawal. One-third of those who experience an episode of schizophrenia recover and the illness does not recur. Another 30% experience an unremitting illness. The remainder have a recurrent illness but with long episodes of considerable recovery from the positive symptoms. The overall cost of the illness to the individuals, their families, and the community is considerable.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2015-07-05 21:43:45 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Conventional antipsychotic drugs were introduced into widespread use in the 1950s, and have since formed the mainstay of drug treatment for schizophrenia. Although these drugs were indeed a revolution, their early promise of complete recovery was unfulfilled. Continued interests in further developments led to the formulation of clozapine in the early 1960s, which, in turn, paved the way for a series of new atypical antipsychotic drugs. This disparate grouping was said to be 'atypical' because they did not seem to cause movement disorders to the same extent as the older generation of drugs.</P>
<P>This series of newer drugs appeared on the market in the early 1990s, risperidone being one of the first. Initially, risperidone was compared with placebo and then with the older-generation antipsychotic drugs, especially haloperidol (<LINK REF="REF-Hunter-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hunter 2003</LINK>). More recently, risperidone has been used as the control compound when other new antipsychotic drugs are compared with a 'standard atypical'. In 2007 risperidone became off-licence, and it seems likely that this drug will emerge as the new standard care comparator, replacing the older and more problematic haloperidol (<LINK REF="REF-Joy-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Joy 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>The absolute effects of a drug are often less well investigated when a standard treatment is widely used, and it is seen as unethical not to treat with drug therapy. With almost everyone having access to older drug treatments for schizophrenia, placebo-controlled trials in this area are now difficult to justify (<LINK REF="REF-Carpenter-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carpenter 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Laughren-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Laughren 2001</LINK>). Yet in many physical diseases, such as angina pectoris, bronchial asthma, herpes simplex, and duodenal ulcers, placebo effects can account for up to 33% of clinical improvement (<LINK REF="REF-Benson-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Benson 1996</LINK>). When it comes to new drugs such as risperidone, clinicians and the public are often provided the evidence for the comparative effects, but the newer drug has been compared with a less-than-ideal drug (<LINK REF="REF-Hunter-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hunter 2003</LINK>). We argue that knowledge of the effects of a drug compared with placebo assists development of a rational therapeutic approach (<LINK REF="REF-Vallance-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vallance 2006</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2015-07-05 21:43:45 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Risperidone (4-[2-[4-(6-fluorobenzo[d]isoxazol-3-yl)-1-piperidyl]ethyl]-3-methyl-2,6-diazabicyclo[4.4.0]deca-1,3-dien-5-one) is a strong postsynaptic dopamine receptor antagonist, but also acts as a 5-HT2A antagonist and is called a serotonin/dopamine antagonist (<LINK REF="REF-Leysen-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leysen 1994</LINK>). Risperidone is rapidly and very well absorbed after administration orally, and less than 1% is excreted unchanged in the faeces (<LINK REF="REF-Heykants-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heykants 1994</LINK>). It reaches peak plasma levels quickly regardless of whether it is administered as a liquid or pill. It is 90% plasma protein bound (<LINK REF="REF-Darby-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Darby 1997</LINK>). Risperidone binds to D2 and D3 receptors with 50 and 20 times greater affinity than clozapine and is only 2 to 3 times less potent than haloperidol. Also, its affinity for D1 receptors is 100 times lower than for D4 receptors (<LINK REF="REF-Leysen-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leysen 1994</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2015-07-05 21:43:45 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Comparing any drug with a placebo has always been an intriguing aspect of drug trials, and some authors, such as <LINK REF="REF-Vallance-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vallance 2006</LINK>, feel that outcome measures are best measured when compared with a placebo as it partly accounts for the philosophical obstacles such as the mind/body dichotomy, which are inherent in conceptualising these effects. In 60% to 90% of diseases, including angina pectoris, bronchial asthma, herpes simples, and duodenal ulcers, placebo effects can account for up to 33% of clinical improvement and yield clinical results (<LINK REF="REF-Benson-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Benson 1996</LINK>). The placebo effect ultimately allows a rationalised therapeutic approach to be developed to maximise the clinical benefit of the therapeutic encounter and evaluate various outcome measures (<LINK REF="REF-Vallance-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vallance 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>Cochrane reviews to date have evaluated the efficacy of risperidone for schizophrenia by comparing it with typical and other atypical antipsychotics. This comparison of risperidone versus placebo is one of a set of reviews on risperidone (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>).</P>

<P>We included continuous data from rating scales only if:<BR/>a. the psychometric properties of the measuring instrument have been described in a peer-reviewed journal (<LINK REF="REF-Marshall-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marshall 2000</LINK>); and<BR/>b. the measuring instrument was not written or modified by one of the trialists for that particular trial.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">2.3 Endpoint versus change data</HEADING>
<P>Both endpoint and change data have advantages. Change data can remove a component of between-person variability from the analysis. On the other hand, calculation of change needs two assessments (baseline and endpoint), which can be difficult in unstable and hard-to-measure conditions such as schizophrenia. We decided to primarily use endpoint data, and only use change data if the former were not available. We combined endpoint and change data in the analysis, as we used mean differences (MD) rather than standardised mean differences (SMD) throughout (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>, Chapter 9.4.5.2).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">2.4 Skewed data</HEADING>
<P>Continuous data on clinical and social outcomes are often not normally distributed. To avoid the pitfall of applying parametric tests to non-parametric data, we aimed to apply the following standards to all data before inclusion: a) standard deviations and means are reported in the paper or obtainable from the authors; b) when a scale starts from the finite number 0, the standard deviation, when multiplied by 2, is less than the mean (as otherwise the mean is unlikely to be an appropriate measure of the centre of the distribution (<LINK REF="REF-Altman-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Altman 1996</LINK>)); c) if a scale started from a positive value (such as the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), which can have values from 30 to 210), we modified the calculation described above to take the scale starting point into account. In these cases, skew is present if 2 SD &gt; (S - S min), where S is the mean score and S min is the minimum score. Endpoint scores on scales often have a finite start and endpoint, and these rules can be applied. We entered skewed endpoint data from studies of fewer than 200 participants in 'other tables' within the <LINK TAG="ANALYSES_AND_DATA" TYPE="SECTION">Data and analyses</LINK> section rather than into a statistical analysis. Skewed data pose less of a problem when looking at mean if the sample size is large; we entered such data from studies with over 200 participants into syntheses. When continuous data are presented on a scale that includes a possibility of negative values (such as change data), it is difficult to tell whether data are skewed or not, we entered skewed change data into analyses.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">2.5 Common measure</HEADING>
<P>Had we identified such data, we intended to convert variables that can be reported in different metrics, such as days in hospital (mean days per year, per week, or per month) to a common metric (for example mean days per month) to facilitate comparison between trials. However, we did not identify such data.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">2.6 Conversion of continuous to binary</HEADING>
<P>Where possible, we made efforts to convert outcome measures to dichotomous data. This can be done by identifying cutoff points on rating scales and dividing participants accordingly into 'clinically improved' or 'not clinically improved'. It is generally assumed that if there is a 50% reduction in a scale-derived score such as the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale, <LINK REF="REF-Overall-1962" TYPE="REFERENCE">Overall 1962</LINK>, or the PANSS, <LINK REF="REF-Kay-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kay 1986</LINK>, this could be considered as a clinically significant response (<LINK REF="REF-Leucht-2005a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leucht 2005a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Leucht-2005b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leucht 2005b</LINK>). If data based on these thresholds were not available, we used the primary cutoff the original authors presented. Some included studies provided a definition of response as a reduction in PANSS or Clinical Global Impression scores, in which case we employed the dichotomous data provided from the primary study report.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">1. Binary data</HEADING>
<P>For binary outcomes, we calculated a standard estimation of the risk ratio (RR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI). It has been shown that RR is more intuitive than odds ratios and that clinicians tend to interpret odds ratios as RR (<LINK REF="REF-Boissel-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boissel 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Deeks-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deeks 2000</LINK>). The number needed to treat to harm statistic with its CIs is intuitively attractive to clinicians but is problematic both in its accurate calculation in meta-analyses and in its interpretation (<LINK REF="REF-Hutton-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hutton 2009</LINK>). For binary data presented in the 'Summary of findings' table/s, where possible, we calculated illustrative comparative risks.</P>

<P>For continuous outcomes, we estimated MD between groups. We preferred not to calculate effect size measures (SMD).

<P>At some degree of loss of follow-up, data loses credibility (<LINK REF="REF-Xia-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Xia 2009</LINK>). For outcomes where more than 50% of data were unaccounted for, we intended to not reproduce these data or use them within analyses.

<HEADING LEVEL="4">2. Binary</HEADING>
<P>In cases where attrition for a binary outcome was between 0% and 50% and where these data were not clearly described, we presented data on a 'once-randomised-always-analyse' basis wherever possible (an intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis). For every outcome with the exception of the outcome of death, we had planned to assume those participants leaving the study early to have the same rates of negative outcome as those who completed. However, doing this drastically changed the significance of many outcomes and sometimes the direction of significant results, so we only presented data that was already available from the studies to reduce the risk of making incorrect assumptions.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">3.2 Standard deviations</HEADING>
<P>We didn't need to calculate any standard deviations (SD) in this review, but our protocol stated that we would first try to obtain missing values from the authors. If not available, where measures of variance for continuous data were missing but an exact standard error (SE) and CI were available for group means, and either the P value or t value was available for differences in means, we calculated SDs according to the rules described in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). When only the SE was reported, we would calculate SDs using the formula SD = SE * square root (n). Sections 7.7.3 and 16.1.3 of the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions </I>
<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>present detailed formulae for estimating SDs from P values, t or F values, CIs, or other statistics (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). If these formulae did not apply, we would calculate the SDs according to a validated imputation method that is based on the SDs of the other included studies (<LINK REF="REF-Furukawa-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Furukawa 2006</LINK>). Although some of these imputation strategies can introduce error, the alternative would be to exclude a given study&#8217;s outcome and thus to lose information. We would nevertheless examine the validity of the imputations in a sensitivity analysis excluding imputed values.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">3.3 Last observation carried forward</HEADING>
<P>We anticipated that some studies would employ the method of last observation carried forward (LOCF). As with all methods of imputation to deal with missing data, LOCF introduces uncertainty about the reliability of the results. Therefore, where a trial used LOCF data, if less than 50% of the data were assumed, we reproduced these data and indicated that they were the product of LOCF assumptions.</P>

<P>Firstly, we considered all the included studies within any comparison to judge clinical heterogeneity. We then visually inspected the graphs in order to investigate the possibility of statistical heterogeneity; to supplement this we used, primarily, the I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic, which provides an estimate of the percentage of variability due to heterogeneity rather than due to chance alone. Where the I<SUP>2</SUP> estimate was greater than or equal to 75%, we interpreted this as indicating the presence of high levels of heterogeneity (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2003</LINK>). If inconsistency became high, we did not summate data, but presented it separately, and we investigated the reasons for heterogeneity.</P>

</BIAS_ASSESSMENT>
<DATA_SYNTHESIS MODIFIED="2015-07-05 21:58:30 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We understand that there is no closed argument for preference for use of fixed-effect or random-effects models. We used the random-effects model for all analyses due to the potential for heterogeneity between studies. The random-effects method incorporates an assumption that the different studies are estimating different, yet related, intervention effects. This often seems to be true to us, and the random-effects model takes into account differences between studies even if there is no statistically significant heterogeneity. However, there is a disadvantage to the random-effects model. It puts added weight on to small studies, which are often the most biased ones. Depending on the direction of effect, these studies can either inflate or deflate the effect size.</P>

<SUBGROUP_ANALYSIS MODIFIED="2015-07-05 21:58:30 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>If data were clearly heterogeneous, we checked that they had been extracted and entered correctly, and that we had made no unit of analysis errors. If the high levels of heterogeneity remained, we did not undertake a meta-analysis at this point, because if there is considerable variation in results, and particularly if there is inconsistency in the direction of effect, it may be misleading to quote an average value for the intervention effect. We prespecified no characteristics of studies that may be associated with heterogeneity except quality of trial method.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">4. Study size</HEADING>
<P>The largest study was <LINK REF="STD-Downing-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Downing 2014</LINK>, which randmised 1009 people to four groups, among which, 437 participants were assigned to either resperidone or placebo group. <LINK REF="STD-Heisterberg-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Heisterberg 2007</LINK> randomised 303 people to receive either risperidone or placebo. <LINK REF="STD-Durgam-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Durgam 2014</LINK> randomised 729 people to five groups, however, only 291 participants were assigned to either resperidone or placebo group. Where a study randomised different doses of risperidone in different arms, as well as having a separate placebo arm, we tried to take data from the risperidone arm that best fitted with the average doses across studies. For example, as the mean dose of risperidone for all the other trials was 5.5 mg per day, we took the 6 mg arm from the <LINK REF="STD-Marder-1994a" TYPE="STUDY">Marder 1994a</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Chouinard-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Chouinard 1992</LINK> trials for efficacy measures in the meta-analysis. In <LINK REF="STD-Potkin-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Potkin 1997</LINK>, which had two risperidone arms of 4 mg and 8 mg, we took the 4 mg arm for efficacy measures in the meta-analysis, as this was closer than the 8 mg arm to the mean of 5.5 mg. <LINK REF="STD-Potkin-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Potkin 2006</LINK> randomised 226 people, <LINK REF="STD-Potkin-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Potkin 2003</LINK> 202, <LINK REF="STD-Marder-1994a" TYPE="STUDY">Marder 1994a</LINK> 130, <LINK REF="STD-Chouinard-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Chouinard 1992</LINK> 44, and <LINK REF="STD-Potkin-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Potkin 1997</LINK> 168.

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">6.1 Mental state</HEADING>
<P>The trials used several different rating scales to report on mental state. <LINK REF="STD-Heisterberg-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Heisterberg 2007</LINK> did not report useable data on mental state, and we could not use the Positive and Negative Symptom Scale (PANSS) data from <LINK REF="STD-Potkin-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Potkin 2007</LINK> as this trial had more than 50% attrition. <LINK REF="STD-Downing-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Downing 2014</LINK> only reported means of PANSS score in each group, therefore we are unable to use the data. All other trials used either the PANSS or the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale to measure this outcome.

<HEADING LEVEL="6">6.7.1 Global state scales</HEADING>
<P>6.7.1.1 Clinical Global Impression (<LINK REF="REF-Guy-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guy 1976</LINK>)<BR/>The CGI scale was used to assess both severity of illness and clinical improvement by comparing the conditions of the person standardised against other people with the same diagnosis. It is a seven-point scoring system with low scores showing decreased severity or overall improvement, or both.</P>
<P>6.7.1.2 Global Assessment of Functioning Scale (<LINK REF="REF-DSM_x002d_IV_x002d_TR" TYPE="REFERENCE">DSM-IV-TR</LINK>)<BR/>The GAF scale is a numeric scale (0 through 100) used by mental-health clinicians and doctors to rate the social, occupational, and psychological functioning of adults. The scale is presented and described in the <LINK REF="REF-DSM_x002d_IV_x002d_TR" TYPE="REFERENCE">DSM-IV-TR</LINK> on page 32 (<LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="6">6.7.2 Mental state scales</HEADING>
<P>6.7.2.1 Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (<LINK REF="REF-Kay-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kay 1986</LINK>)<BR/>The PANSS is used for measuring symptom severity of people with schizophrenia. It is widely used in the study of antipsychotic therapy. The name refers to the two types of symptoms in schizophrenia, as defined by the American Psychiatric Association: positive symptoms, which refer to an excess or distortion of normal functions, and negative symptoms, which represent a diminution or loss of normal functions.</P>
<P>6.7.2.2 Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (<LINK REF="REF-Overall-1962" TYPE="REFERENCE">Overall 1962</LINK>)<BR/>The BPRS consists of 18 items on a 7-point severity scale. Initially published as a 16-item scale in 1962, the standard 18-item version has been used since 1967 to successfully demonstrate efficacy of antidepressants, anti-anxiety drugs, and antipsychotics, including the newer 'atypical' antipsychotics. The BPRS has also been used in epidemiological studies, geropsychiatric research, and to compare diagnostic concepts between countries. It is most frequently used in schizophrenia. When using BPRS, rater training is a must and the use of a standardised interview is highly recommended in order to ascertain consistent results.</P>
<P>6.7.2.3 Calgary Depression Scale for Schizophrenia (<LINK REF="REF-Addington-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Addington 1993</LINK>)<BR/>Developed at the University of Calgary, the CDSS specifically assesses the level of depression in schizophrenia. It has been extensively evaluated in both relapsed and remitted patients and appears sensitive to change.</P>
<P>6.7.2.4 Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms (<LINK REF="REF-Andreasen-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Andreasen 1981</LINK>)<BR/>The SANS assesses affective blunting, alogia, avolition/apathy, anhedonia/asociality, and disturbance of attention to measure negative symptoms in schizophrenia.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="6">6.7.3 Adverse effects scales</HEADING>
<P>6.7.3.1 Barnes Akathisia Scale (<LINK REF="REF-Barnes-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barnes 1989</LINK>)<BR/>The Barnes Akathisia Scale (commonly known as BAS or BARS) is a four-item rating scale administered by physicians to assess the severity of drug-induced akathisia. The most widely used scale for akathisia, it includes both objective items (e.g. observed restlessness) and subjective items (e.g. patient's awareness of restlessness and related distress), together with a global clinical assessment of akathisia. Global assessment is made on a scale of 0 to 5, with comprehensive definitions provided for each anchor point on the scale: 0 = absent; 1 = questionable; 2 = mild akathisia; 3 = moderate akathisia; 4 = marked akathisia; 5 = severe akathisia.</P>
<P>6.7.3.2 Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating Scale (<LINK REF="REF-Chouinard-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chouinard 1993</LINK>)<BR/>The ESRS is a physician-rated scale for measuring extrapyramidal adverse effects from antipsychotic medication. It takes approximately 10 minutes and involves 6 questions about the person&#8217;s subjective experience of extrapyramidal features (slowness, stiffness, and tremor); a standardised procedure for physical examination; and 7 rater-assessed items that address parkinsonian features (rigidity and tremor). The instrument may not differentiate effectively between dyskinesia and dystonia.</P>
<P>6.7.3.3 Simpson Angus Scale (<LINK REF="REF-Simpson-1970" TYPE="REFERENCE">Simpson 1970</LINK>)<BR/>The SAS is a 10-item instrument used to evaluate the presence and severity of parkinsonian symptomatology specifically in patients who may be experiencing drug-induced parkinsonism and other extrapyramidal effects. For the past 25 years it has been the most commonly used rating scale for parkinsonism in clinical trials. The 10 items focus on rigidity rather than bradykinesia, and do not assess subjective rigidity or slowness. Items are rated for severity on a 0 to 4 scale, with definitions given for each anchor point.</P>
<P>6.7.3.4 Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (<LINK REF="REF-Guy-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guy 1976</LINK>)<BR/>The AIMS is a 12-item clinician-rated scale to assess severity of dyskinesias including orofacial movements, extremity and truncal movements in patients taking neuroleptic medications.</P>
<P>6.7.3.5 The UKU side effect rating scale (<LINK REF="REF-Lingjaerde-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lingjaerde 1987</LINK>)</P>
<P>UKU is a 48 item clinician-rated scale to assess the side effects of psychopharmacological medications. The interview takes anywhere from 10-30 minutes depending on the number of symptoms reported, the complexity of the symptoms, and the patient&#8217;s ability to provide good report.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="6">6.7.4 Quality of life scales</HEADING>
<P>6.7.4.1 Quality of Life Scale (<LINK REF="REF-Carpenter-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carpenter 1994</LINK>)<BR/>The QLS is a 21-item scale rated from a semistructured interview providing information on symptoms and functioning during the preceding 4 weeks. It is intended to be administered by a trained clinician and requires about 45 minutes to complete. Each item is rated on a 7-point scale and, in all but 2 cases, requires a judgement by the clinician/interviewer. Each item is comprised of 3 parts: (1) a brief descriptive statement to focus the interviewer on the judgement to be made; (2) a set of suggested probes; and (3) the 7-point scale with descriptive anchors for every other point. The specific descriptions vary among items, but the high end of the scales (scores 5 and 6) reflects normal or unimpaired functioning, and the low end of the scales (scores 0 and 1) reflects severe impairment of the function in question. The interviewer is instructed to probe around each item until he or she has an adequate basis for making the required judgement, and is encouraged to go beyond the suggested probes with questions tailored for the individual patient. Thus the experience of both the patient and interviewer is similar to a careful clinical interview.</P>

<P>6.7.5.1 Groton Maze Learning Test (<LINK REF="REF-Pietrzak-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pietrzak 2008</LINK>) (used in an ongoing study)<BR/>The GMLT assesses processing speed, working memory, and aspects of executive function in healthy adults. Performance on GMLT outcome measures can be compared to performance on tests of psychomotor speed, working memory, and learning from the <A HREF="http://www.cogstate.com/">Cogstate computerized cognitive test battery</A>. Studies suggest that the GMLT measures of spatial learning efficiency and error monitoring correlate with Cogstate measures of attention, working memory, and learning. Exploratory factor analyses have yielded a two-factor solution of error monitoring and learning efficiency, which have been stable across repeated assessments.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">1. COMPARISON 1: RISPERIDONE versus PLACEBO</HEADING>
<P>All of the included studies contributed data towards the comparison of risperidone versus placebo. Despite there being data from 15 studies in total, more often than not only a few studies contributed useable data towards each outcome. Most of the findings were based on few data, which in the majority of cases was of poor quality. The ratings within the Summary of findings table 1 reflect this, as we have judged the overall quality of evidence to be low or very low for each of the four main clinically relevant outcomes.</P>
<P>There is a clear difference in the treatment effect favouring risperidone group. Compared to placebo, people who received risperidone has a 36% risk reduction (very low quality of evidence) in not achieving clinically significant improvement in psychotic symptoms. The effect withstood, even when three studies with &gt;50% attrition rate were removed from the analysis (3 RCTs, N = 589, RR 0.77, CI 0.67 to 0.88). Risperidone group also achieved greater reduction on BPRS score (a reduction of 12.69 compared to placebo group) and PANSS score (a reduction of 17.81 compared to placebo group). However the quality of evidence is compromised due to risk of bias of included studies, the slight heterogeneity and the involvement of industry sponsorship. Similarly, risperidone group are more likely to achieve significant clinical improvement than placebo group (a risk reduction of 31% in risperidone group, very low quality of evidence).</P>
<P>A variety of reasons have caused people to leave the study early, but most showed no clear difference between groups. However, placebo group had significantly more people left the study early due to lack of efficacy (a risk reduction of 61% if one receives risperidone, low quality evidence). Overall, risperidone group is 31% less likely to drop out early compared to placebo group (low quality evidence). The participants have also experienced a range of adverse events, but most had similar incidence rate between groups, but some clearly favoured placebo group including, EPS (1.56 times less likely compared to risperidone group), akathisia (2.58 times times less likely compared to risperidone group), hypertonia (2.98 times times less likely compared to risperidone group) and parkinsonism (7.64 times times less likely compared to risperidone group), somnolence (1.61 times times less likely compared to risperidone group), constipation (1.88 times less likely), weight gain (3.77 times less likely), upper respiratory infection (2.83 times less likely), rhinitis (10.81 times less likely).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">2. COMPARISON 2: RISPERIDONE plus CLOZAPINE versus PLACEBO plus CLOZAPINE</HEADING>
<P>When combined with clozapine, there was no obvious difference between groups in achieving clinically significant response in psychotic symptoms (low quality evidence). However, placebo plus clozapine group achieved greater reduction in PANSS score (MD = 5.56, 95% CI 1.59 to 9.53), while risperidone plus clozapine group appeared to produce more improvement in general functioning as assessed by GAF (MD = -4.5, 95% CI -8.38 to -0.62). Participants left the study early for a variety of reasons, but none of which discriminated against any interventions (very low quality of evidence). Similarly, we did not find any clear difference in the adverse events experienced between groups.</P>

<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2016-10-25 23:10:35 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The review included 15 studies (n = 2428) of relatively short duration, between 8 and 16 weeks, hence limiting the applicability of the results of this review to long term use of risperidone. All participants in included trials were adults diagnosed with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. The studies took place in both primary and secondary care settings, however, most were conducted in high income countries, hence the evidence should be applied with care in developing countries. There was a lack of data in included studies on the following outcome, including service utilisation and quality of life.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Issue of placebo-controlled trials</HEADING>
<P>Placebo-controlled trials have been used as a licensing requirement by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and other regulatory authorities for some time. Since 1964, the Helsinki Ethical Principles for Medical Research Involving Human Subjects <LINK REF="REF-WMA-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">WMA 2008</LINK> have been considered a benchmark for trialists around the world (<LINK REF="REF-WMA-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">WMA 2008</LINK>). However, recently it has been argued that it is unethical to conduct trials involving placebo arms for conditions that have an established standard treatment. Also recently, the FDA has adopted the less rigorous Good Clinical Practice as an alternative to the Helsinki declaration, although this has invited numerous criticisms (<LINK REF="REF-Lurie-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lurie 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lurie-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lurie 2005</LINK>). Nevertheless, placebo trials do still have an important place, and some ethical bodies around the world do approve of trial methodologies with placebo arms. We suggest that the findings of this review support the continued need for placebo-controlled studies. risperidone is a widely used drug. That many of the effects of this compound are not that different from a placebo is important and would not have been highlighted but for the use of this type of study.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2016-10-25 23:45:58 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The quality of reporting in most studies could have been much better (<LINK REF="FIG-04" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 4</LINK>). Well over half of the included studies have concerns in sequence generation and allocation concealment. There has also been some controversy over the trials conducted by Borison, with the author being accused of scientific fraud (see <LINK TAG="INCLUDED_STUDIES_DESCR" TYPE="SECTION">Included studies</LINK>). Although<I>, </I>the trialists have not been found to have fabricated research data, this cast a shadow to the findings of his trials (<LINK REF="REF-AHRP-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">AHRP 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-CBS-News-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">CBS News 2000CBS News 2000</LINK>
<LINK REF="REF-AHRP-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">AHRP 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>Now, years after the first Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) statement (<LINK REF="REF-Begg-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Begg 1996</LINK>), it is expected that all relevant details of methodology that are likely to influence outcome, such as means of allocation and concealment of allocation, are documented and reported. Only 5 out of 13 studies provided information about sequence generation, and 3 out of 13 provided any details about allocation concealment. Good randomisation methodology is essential, and more so for smaller trials, as it ensures that confounding variables are as equally distributed as possible between the intervention and control groups. Poor quality or inadequate randomisation procedures would instead produce imbalance between groups in terms of participant selection and could potentially bias the result. </P>

<P>The authors of this review made every effort to minimise bias in the review process by strictly following the Cochrane Handbook and conduct expectations. The majority of data in this review were collected from published reports. Even though we identified substantial number of conference proceedings and unpublished reports, however, we were not able to extract much data from these reports due to either poor reporting or lack of collection at trial stage, therefore, could not be used in this review. For example, in some studies trialists reported mean without standard deviation. Our attempts to contact authors of trials for additional data were unsuccessful. This directly results in </P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">2. Omission of relevant data or studies</HEADING>
<P>As defined in our protocol, we had to omit efficacy measures from studies that had attrition rates of higher than 50% at study endpoint in a sensitivity analysis for our main outcomes. We are not sure if this is correct, but have identified no ready solution to the problem of missing data and when assumptions become too much and undermine credibility (<LINK REF="REF-Xia-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Xia 2009</LINK>). Certainly, high attrition rates, poor reporting, and poor methodology, combined with the rules we had set ourselves within our protocol, limited the information available for us to use. We feel that people can leave the trials for several reasons, most of which are not specified in the reports. Many studies carried the last observation of such people to the end of the trial period and used those data as if things stayed stable beyond leaving the study. This may or may not be correct but has gone untested. We have taken a conservative approach in presentation of the available data.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">1. For people with schizophrenia</HEADING>
<P>Risperidone has a positive effect on the mental state of people with schizophrenia, but data in this review are of low to very low quality, suggesting that future research is very likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and is likely to change the estimate.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">2. For clinicians</HEADING>
<P>While mental state and global state outcomes favoured risperidone, when used alone, there is a high amount of uncertainty regarding this these data and, even if credible, their direct clinical meaning is unclear. Due in large part to poor reporting, we are very uncertain about the effects of risperidone on adverse effects.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">3. For managers/policymakers</HEADING>
<P>We found some low quality evidence, which supported the efficacy of risperidone compared to placebo. Based on the same body of evidence, it appears risperidone also causes more adverse events than placebo, and from the available evidence, it is unclear if the benefit out weight the harm. In summary, there is insufficient evidence from this review to support preferential use of risperidone over placebo. Policymakers are encouraged to allocate resources to fund bigger trials with greater methodological quality.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">1. General</HEADING>
<P>Strict adherence to the CONSORT statement may well have resulted in this review having more data. Full availability of all data from each study could greatly help future review authors. Many of the studies included in this review did not always clearly present denominator data, did not mention allocation concealment, and frequently described results as "significant" without original data. Multiple publications is another concern. Authors of this review inspectd a large number of publications, which eventually were identified as salami publication of the same trial. Multiple publication poses a risk for reviewers, as if not discovered, the data could be double counted which inadvertently results in biased summary. If mutiple publication is unavoidable, quoting specific trial identifiers such as the International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial Number would greatly reduce confusion over identification of the source of trial. </P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">2. Specific</HEADING>
<P>Many excluded trials could find a place in new or existing systematic reviews, and although many of the 'risperidone versus (other antipsychotic)' reviews have been undertaken, there are many others still to do before a full overview of the effects of risperidone in every comparison is complete (<LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK>).</P>
<P>More independent well-planned, well-conducted, and well-reported RCTs of longer duration are needed to address important, unanswered clinically relevant outcomes. In <LINK REF="TBL-04" TYPE="TABLE">Table 4</LINK>, we have a recommended study design for future trials. Even though we included 15 studies in this review, we could present few clinically meaningful results. As a result, we are uncertain of the short-, medium-, and long-term efficacy of using this popular treatment.</P>

<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Hutton-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hutton 2012</LINK> has highlighted the following issues regarding this review:</P>
<P>1. 'Fixed effect' analysis was used instead of 'random effects' analysis for the outcome of 20% change in total PANSS/BPRS scores.</P>
<P>2. Should not have included <LINK REF="STD-Marder-1994a" TYPE="STUDY">Marder 1994a</LINK> in our analysis, as the overall attrition rate for this study was over 50%.</P>
<P>3. Should not have included <LINK REF="STD-Borison-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Borison 1992</LINK> study in our analysis, as an internal confidential report by Janssen Pharmaceuticals reports a different leaving the study early rate than that of the original published paper.</P>
<P>4. It is incorrect to derive standard deviation from standard error in <LINK REF="STD-Chouinard-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Chouinard 1992</LINK>, and data were entered wrong way round for two outcomes: endpoint Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) total score and Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) positive symptom score.</P>

<P>Thank you for your comments. </P>
<P>We have now repeated the analysis for the outcome 20% change in total PANSS/BPRS score by using 'random effects' model instead of fixed effects. With the 'fixed effects' analysis RR was 0.7 favouring risperidone and with 'random effect' analysis the RR is 0.68 favouring risperidone and hence there is no change in the overall outcome. </P>
<P>As regards the <LINK REF="STD-Marder-1994a" TYPE="STUDY">Marder 1994a</LINK> study, it has an overall attrition rate of over 50%. However this study has three arms of risperidone and we included data from only the 6mg arm as this was closest to what is clinically most commonly used. This intervention arm of 6mg per day of risperidone had an attrition rate of 45% (page 828, American Journal of Psychiatry, 151:6 June 1994). The attrition rate for this particular arm was less than 50% and hence this was included. </P>
<P>The attrition rate in <LINK REF="STD-Borison-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Borison 1992</LINK> as reported by the original published paper is zero. This did appear too good to be true, however our attempts to contact the authors were unsuccessful and we did not have access to any other data. We would be keen to have a look at the internal confidential report by Janssen if this indeed reports a different drop out rate and would be grateful if anyone with access to this can forward the data to the authors.</P>
<P>For data extraction from the <LINK REF="STD-Chouinard-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Chouinard 1992</LINK> study, we have used formula recommended by the Cochrane Handbook to derive Standard Deviation <LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2008</LINK>. The authors checked <LINK REF="STD-Chouinard-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Chouinard 1992</LINK> data and are assured that we have reported it accurately in our review. The paper reports the figures for the number of patients showing more than 20% improvement in BPRS/PANSS but in our review we have extrapolated the figures for '&lt;20% decrease in PANSS/BPRS total score'. Although the primary publication for <LINK REF="STD-Honer-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Honer 2006</LINK> reports only the PANSS scores, we found additional published data (International Congress of Schizophrenia Research 2005, page 487) which provides data on CGI-S scores.</P>

<P>Paul Hutton from the Psychosis Research Unit, Psychology Department, Greater Manchester West Mental Health Trust, UK, has sent an email to the authors of this review wherein he claims that the review authors should not have included the two clozapine augmentation studies in the review (<LINK REF="STD-Yagcioglu-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Yagcioglu 2005</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Honer-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Honer 2006</LINK>), or should have analysed these separately.</P>

<P>We acknowledge that the two clozapine augmentation studies could have been analysed separately. We have thus now analysed our results with and without these two studies, and the results of this sensitivity analysis are as follows.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">2.1 Leaving the study early - for any reason</HEADING>
<P>With the clozapine augmentation studies the results are: 11 RCTs, N = 1363, RR 0.7 (0.57, 0.86), favours risperidone. Without the clozapine augmentation studies the results are: 9 RCTs, N = 1265, RR 0.69 (0.56, 0.85), still favours risperidone. Exclusion of clozapine augmentation studies makes no difference to this outcome.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">2.2 Leaving study early - due to adverse effects</HEADING>
<P>With the clozapine augmentation studies the results are: 6 RCTs, N = 829, RR 1.09 (0.43, 2.74), not statistically significant. Without the clozapine augmentation studies the results are: 5 RCTs, N = 761, RR 1.03 (0.38, 2.81), still not statistically significant. Exclusion of the clozapine augmentation studies makes no difference to this outcome.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">2.3 Leaving the study early - due to withdrawal of consent</HEADING>
<P>With the clozapine augmentation studies the results are: 4 RCTs, N = 368, RR 1.2 (0.44, 3.28), not statistically significant. Without the clozapine augmentation studies the results are: 3 RCTs, N = 300, RR 1.39 (0.48, 4.00), still not statistically significant. Exclusion of the clozapine augmentation study makes no difference to this outcome.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">2.4 Global state - no clinically significant improvement (CGI-Severity)</HEADING>
<P>With the clozapine augmentation studies the results are: 3 RCTs, N = 397, RR 0.8 (0.55, 1.15), not statistically significant. Without the clozapine augmentation studies the results are: 2 RCTs, N = 329, RR 0.67 (0.46, 0.98), favours risperidone. Exclusion of the clozapine augmentation study changes the result in favour of risperidone for this outcome.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">2.5 Global state - average endpoint score (CGI-Severity)</HEADING>
<P>With the clozapine augmentation studies the results are: 4 RCTs, N = 266, WMD -0.29 (-1.18, 0.59), not statistically significant. Without the clozapine augmentation studies the results are: 2 RCTs, N = 171, WMD -1.01 (-1.38, -0.64), favours risperidone. Exclusion of the clozapine augmentation study changes the result in favour of risperidone for this outcome.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">2.7 Mental state - &lt; 20% decline on PANSS total change score</HEADING>
<P>With the clozapine augmentation studies the results are: 4 RCTs, N = 407, RR 0.64 (0.39, 1.04), not statistically significant. Without the clozapine augmentation studies the results are: 3 RCTs, N = 339, RR 0.54 (0.4 0.74), favours risperidone.

<HEADING LEVEL="4">2.8 Mental state - &lt; 20% decrease in PANSS/BPRS total change score</HEADING>
<P>With the clozapine augmentation studies the results are: 7 RCTs, N = 856, RR 0.7 (0.62, 0.79), favours risperidone. Without the clozapine augmentation studies the results are: 6 RCTs, N = 788, RR 0.66 (0.58, 0.76), favours risperidone. Exclusion of clozapine augmentation study makes no difference to this outcome.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">2.9 Mental state - average endpoint score (PANSS Total score)</HEADING>
<P>With the clozapine augmentation studies the results are: 4 RCTs, N = 266, WMD -7.55 (-22.04, 6.95), not statistically significant. Without the clozapine augmentation studies the results are: 2 RCTs, N = 171, WMD -20.13 (-27.33, ...), favours risperidone. Exclusion of the clozapine augmentation studies changes the result in favour of risperidone for this outcome.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">2.10 Mental state - average endpoint score (PANSS General score)</HEADING>
<P>With the clozapine augmentation studies the results are: 2 RCTs, N = 74, WMD -5 (-20.37, 10), not statistically significant. Without the clozapine augmentation studies the results are: 1 RCT, N = 44, WMD -13.2 (-20.15, ...), favours risperidone. Exclusion of the clozapine augmentation study leaves only one RCT for this outcome, which is in favour of risperidone.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">2.11 Mental state - average endpoint score (PANSS Negative symptom score)</HEADING>
<P>With the clozapine augmentation studies the results are: 4 RCTs, N = 266, WMD -0.9 (-3.06, 1.27), not statistically significant. Without the clozapine augmentation studies the results are: 2 RCTs, N = 171, WMD -2.84 (-4.96, -0.73), favours risperidone. Exclusion of the two clozapine augmentation studies changes this outcome in favour of risperidone.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">2.12 Mental state - average endpoint score (PANSS Positive symptom score)</HEADING>
<P>With the clozapine augmentation studies the results are: 4 RCTs, N = 266, WMD 1.67 (-2.93, 6.28), not statistically significant. Without the clozapine augmentation studies the results are: 2 RCTs, N = 171, WMD 1.52 (-12.69, 15.73), still not statistically significant. Exclusion of the two clozapine augmentation studies does not change this outcome.</P>
<P>Thus, in summary, exclusion of the two clozapine augmentation studies either makes no difference to the main outcomes or shifts the results slightly more in favour of risperidone on some of the outcomes related to mental state. These augmentation studies contribute to less than 20% of the data, and we feel that it is only fair to include them in the review, as in real life many more people with schizophrenia are going to be on a combination of antipsychotics.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Data collection and analysis</HEADING>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Selection of studies</HEADING>
<P>We (RR, MJ) independently inspected all reports of identified studies. Any disagreements were resolved by consensus; where doubts remained, we acquired the full article. We independently decided whether these studies met the review criteria. We did not intend to blind the names of authors, institutions, and journal of publication. Again, we resolved any disagreements by consensus. When this was not possible, we sought further information and, in the interim, added these trials to the <A HREF="https://archie.cochrane.org/sections/documents/view?version=24159880049646369400091110144313&amp;format=REVMAN#AWAITING_STUDIES">Studies awaiting classification</A> list. RR and MJ independently inspected citations from the subsequent updated search (December 2007) and identified the relevant abstracts. We obtained and inspected full reports of the abstracts meeting the review criteria.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Data extraction and management</HEADING>
<P>1. We (RR, MJ) independently extracted data and resolved any disagreements by discussion. When this was not possible, we sought further information from the trial authors.</P>
<P>1.1 Binary data<BR/>When summation was appropriate, with binary outcomes such as improved/not improved, we calculated the risk ratio statistic with a 95% confidence interval and used a random-effects model. In addition, as a measure of efficiency, we estimated the number needed to treat to benefit or the number needed to treat to harm from the pooled totals.</P>
<P>1.2. Continuous data<BR/>1.2.1 Normally distributed data<BR/>Continuous data on clinical and social outcomes are often not normally distributed. To avoid the pitfall of applying parametric tests to non-parametric data, we applied the following standards to all data before inclusion: (a) standard deviations (SD) and means reported in the paper were obtained from the authors; (b) when a scale starts from the finite number 0, the SD, when multiplied by 2, is less than the mean (as otherwise the mean is unlikely to be an appropriate measure of the centre of the distribution) (<LINK REF="REF-Altman-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Altman 1996</LINK>); (c) if a scale started from a positive value (such as Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale, which can have values from 30 to 210), the calculation described above was modified to take the scale starting point into account. In these cases skew will be present if 2 SD &gt; (S - S min), where S is the mean score and S min is the minimum score. Endpoint scores on scales often have a finite start and endpoint, and these rules can be applied to them. When continuous data are presented on a scale that includes a possibility of negative values (such as change on a scale), it is difficult to tell whether data are non-normally distributed (skewed) or not. We presented skewed data in the 'Other data' tables rather than included in the analysis.</P>
<P>For change data (endpoint minus baseline), the situation is even more problematic. In the absence of individual participant data, it is impossible to know if data are skewed, though this is likely. After consulting the ALLSTAT electronic statistics mailing list, we presented the change data in order to summarise the available information. In doing this, we assumed that data was not skewed or that the analyses can cope with the unknown degree of skew. Again, without individual participant data it was impossible to test this assumption. Where both change and endpoint data were available for the same outcome category, we presented only the endpoint data. We acknowledge that by doing this, much of the published change data can be excluded, but our argument is that endpoint data is more clinically relevant and that if change data were to be presented along with endpoint data, it would give undeserved equal prominence to both. We contacted the authors of studies that only reported change for endpoint figures.</P>
<P>1.2.2 Summary statistic<BR/>For continuous outcomes, we estimated a weighted mean difference between groups. Again, this was based on the random-effects model, as this took into account any differences between studies even if there was no statistically significant heterogeneity. We did not consider continuous data presented without use of summary statistics (that is mean, SD, standard error, median, interquartile range), although we noted the existence of these data in the text.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Assessment of risk of bias in included studies</HEADING>
<P>Again working independently, review authors assessed risk of bias using the tool described in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2008</LINK>). This tool encourages consideration of how the sequence was generated, how allocation was concealed, the integrity of blinding at outcome, the completeness of outcome data, selective reporting, and other biases. We excluded studies where allocation was clearly not concealed.</P>
<P>We removed trials with high risk of bias (defined as at least three out of five domains categorised as 'no') from the 'included' category. When the raters disagreed, the final rating was made by consensus with the involvement of another review author. Where details of randomisation and other characteristics of trials were inadequate, we contacted authors of the studies to obtain further information. We reported non-concurrence in quality assessment.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Measures of treatment effect</HEADING>
<P>Many rating scales are available to measure outcomes in mental health trials (<LINK REF="REF-Marshall-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marshall 2000</LINK>). These scales vary in quality, and many are poorly validated. It is generally accepted that measuring instruments should have the properties of reliability (the extent to which a test effectively measures anything at all) and validity (the extent to which a test measures that which it is supposed to measure). Before publication of an instrument, most scientific journals insist that its reliability and validity be demonstrated to the satisfaction of referees. As a minimum standard, we excluded data from unpublished rating scales. In addition, the rating scale was either: (i) a self report; or (ii) completed by an independent rater or relative. If continuous data were presented from different scales rating the same outcome, we presented all data without summation and inspected the general direction of effect.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Unit of analysis issues</HEADING>
<P>To facilitate comparison between trials, we intended to convert variables (such as days in hospital) that can be reported in different metrics (mean days per year, per week, or per month) to a common metric (for example mean days per month). We converted weight gain reported in pounds to kilograms where possible.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Dealing with missing data</HEADING>
<P>Where possible, we analysed the data on an intention-to-treat basis and assumed that those who had not been accounted for had the less positive outcome. We did not include this rule for the outcome of 'death'. We intended to test this assumption with a sensitivity analysis. For continuous data, which was impossible to manage in this way, we presented only the 'completer' data. Wherever feasible, we converted the continuous scores to dichotomous data.</P>
<P>If, for a given outcome (except adverse effects), more than 50% of the total numbers randomised were not accounted for, we did not present the results, as such data are impossible to interpret with authority. If, however, more than 50% of those in one arm of a study were lost, but the total loss was less than 50%, we marked such data with '*' to indicate that such result may well be prone to bias.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Assessment of heterogeneity</HEADING>
<P>Firstly, we considered all the included studies within any comparison to judge clinical heterogeneity. We then visually inspected the graphs in order to investigate the possibility of statistical heterogeneity; to supplement this we used, primarily, the I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic, which provides an estimate of the percentage of variability due to heterogeneity rather than due to chance alone. Where the I<SUP>2</SUP> estimate was greater than or equal to 75%, we interpreted this as indicating the presence of high levels of heterogeneity (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2003</LINK>). If inconsistency became high, we did not summate data, but presented it separately, and we investigated the reasons for heterogeneity.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Assessment of reporting biases</HEADING>
<P>In order to investigate the likelihood of overt publication bias, we entered all data from all identified and selected trials into a funnel graph (trial effect against trial size) (<LINK REF="REF-Egger-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Egger 1997</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Data synthesis</HEADING>
<P>Where possible, we entered data in such a way that the area to the left of the line of no effect indicated a favourable outcome for risperidone. Studies increasingly employ 'cluster randomisation' (such as randomisation by clinician or practice), but analysis and pooling of clustered data pose problems. Firstly, authors often fail to account for intraclass correlation (ICC) in clustered studies, leading to a 'unit of analysis' error (<LINK REF="REF-Divine-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Divine 1992</LINK>), whereby P values are spuriously low, confidence intervals are unduly narrow, and statistical significance gets overestimated. This causes type I errors (<LINK REF="REF-Bland-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bland 1997</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Gulliford-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gulliford 1999</LINK>).<BR/>
<BR/>Where clustering was not accounted for in primary studies, we presented the data in a table with a (*) symbol to indicate the presence of a probable unit of analysis error. In subsequent versions of the review, we will seek out first authors of studies to obtain ICC of their clustered data and use accepted methods to adjust for this (<LINK REF="REF-Gulliford-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gulliford 1999</LINK>). Where clustering has been incorporated into the analysis of primary studies, we also presented these data as if from a non-cluster randomised study, but adjusted for the clustering effect. We have sought statistical advice and have been advised that the binary data presented in a report should be divided by a 'design effect'. This is calculated using the mean number of participants per cluster (m) and the ICC Design effect = 1 + (m - 1)*ICC (<LINK REF="REF-Donner-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Donner 2002</LINK>). If the ICC was not reported, we assumed it to be 0.1 (<A HREF="https://archie.cochrane.org/sections/documents/view?version=24159880049646369400091110144313&amp;format=REVMAN#REF-Ukoumunne-1999">Ukoumunne 1999</A>). If cluster studies had been appropriately analysed, taking into account ICCs, and relevant data documented in the report, we synthesised these with other studies using the generic inverse variance technique.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity</HEADING>
<P>If data were clearly heterogeneous, we checked that they had been extracted and entered correctly, and that we had made no unit of analysis errors. If the high levels of heterogeneity remained, we did not undertake a meta-analysis at this point, because if there is considerable variation in results, and particularly if there is inconsistency in the direction of effect, it may be misleading to quote an average value for the intervention effect. We prespecified no characteristics of studies that may be associated with heterogeneity except quality of trial method.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Sensitivity analysis</HEADING>
<P>If studies had high attrition rates, we analysed the effect of including these studies in a sensitivity analysis, but we did not include any figures with more than 50% attrition in the analysis of efficacy. Where a trial was described as 'double-blind', but it was implied that the study was randomised, we intended to include such studies in the sensitivity analysis, but we did not come across any such studies.</P>
