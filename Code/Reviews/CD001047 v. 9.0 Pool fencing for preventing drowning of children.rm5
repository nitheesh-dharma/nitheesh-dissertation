<SUMMARY>
<TITLE>Fencing which completely encloses all sides of a swimming pool and isolates it from the home is effective in preventing drowning of young children</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>In most industrialized countries, drowning is one of the top killers of children, especially young children. Medical care offers little to help drowning victims, and thus survival must rely on prevention of the drowning. The review found no trials of pool fencing. However evidence from other studies found that pool fencing that adequately prevents children reaching the pool unsupervised can prevent about three-quarters of all child drownings in pools. Fencing which completely encircles the pool and isolates it from the house is much more effective than methods where children can still gain access to the pool through the house.</P>
</SUMMARY_BODY>
</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>In most industrialized countries, drowning ranks second or third behind motor vehicles and fires as a cause of unintentional injury deaths to children under the age of 15. Death rates from drowning are highest in children less than five years old. Pool fencing is a passive environmental intervention designed to reduce unintended access to swimming pools and thus prevent drowning in the preschool age group. Because of the magnitude of the problem and the potential effectiveness of fencing, we decided to evaluate the effect of pool fencing as a drowning prevention strategy for young children.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To determine if pool fencing prevents drowning in children (under 14 years of age).</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>We searched the Cochrane Injuries Group's Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, National Research Register, Zetoc and other specialist databases. We searched reference lists of relevant articles and contacted relevant organisations and experts. The searches were last updated in October 2006.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>In order to be selected, a study had to be designed to evaluate pool fencing in a defined population and provide relevant and interpretable data that objectively measured the risk of drowning or near-drowning or provided rates of these outcomes in fenced and unfenced pools.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Data were extracted by two authors using a standard abstract form. Odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI), and incidence rates, were calculated for drowning and near-drowning.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Three case-control studies met the selection criteria. The results of these studies indicate that pool fencing significantly reduces the risk of drowning. The OR for the risk of drowning or near drowning in a fenced pool compared to an unfenced pool is 0.27 (95% CI 0.16 to 0.47). Isolation fencing (enclosing pool only) is superior to perimeter fencing (enclosing property and pool); the OR for the risk of drowning in a pool with isolation fencing compared to a pool with three-sided fencing is 0.17 (95% CI 0.07 to 0.44).</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>Pool fences should have a dynamic and secure gate and should isolate the pool from the house (that is, four-sided fencing). Legislation should require isolation fencing with secure, self-latching gates for all pools, public, semi-public and private. Legislation should require fencing of both newly constructed and existing pools and include enforcement provisions, in order to be effective.</P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>

<BODY MODIFIED="2008-07-31 18:06:00 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma M Sydenham">
<BACKGROUND>
<P>In most industrialized countries, drowning ranks second or third, behind motor vehicles and fires, as a cause of unintentional injury deaths to children under the age of 15. Death rates from drowning are highest in children less than five years old. Among children, the most important risk factors for drowning are age and, to some degree, location. For infants, bathtub drowning poses the greatest hazard. Once children attain mobility as toddlers (ages one to four years), swimming pools pose the greatest risk of immersion injury. Rates vary by area and are higher in locations where the weather is hot and exposure to swimming pools is the greatest. For example, the rate for children aged four years and under in the US is 3.9 per 100,000 but 9.4 per 100,000 in Arizona (<LINK REF="REF-US-Mortality-Data" TYPE="REFERENCE">US Mortality Data</LINK>). The preschool drowning rate in Australia is 8.2 per 100,000 and varies from 4.69 in the Australian Capital Territory (Canberra) to 15.7 per 100,000 in Queensland (<LINK REF="STD-Pearn-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Pearn 1979</LINK>).</P>
<P>It has been estimated that for each childhood drowning fatality, about four children are hospitalized (<LINK REF="REF-Wintemute-1990a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wintemute 1990a</LINK>) and 14 are seen in the emergency department and released (<LINK REF="REF-Spyker-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spyker 1985</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-Geddis-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Geddis 1984</LINK> estimated that there were 10 "near misses", that is children sustaining immersion who were rapidly rescued, for each child seen in the emergency department. However, among those sustaining immersion and losing consciousness, the mortality rate is as high as 50%. The outcome for most children with immersion is determined by their status on arrival to the emergency department; medical and intensive care unit (ICU) care once admitted appear to have relatively little impact on outcome. </P>
<P>Pool fencing is a passive environmental intervention, designed to reduce unintended access to swimming pools and thus prevent drowning in the preschool age group.</P>
<P>Over the last decade many communities, particularly in Australia, have passed laws requiring the fencing of private and public pools. In fact, much of the evidence that pool fencing reduces the risk of drowning among children comes from studies examining before-and-after rates of drowning for fenced and unfenced pools. Even after some of the pioneering studies had been done, the favorable attitude toward pool fencing did not necessarily translate into actual changes in pool fencing (<LINK REF="REF-Choo-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Choo 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fergusson-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fergusson 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nixon-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Nixon 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wintemute-1990b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wintemute 1990b</LINK>).</P>
<P>More recently, studies have examined whether the <I>type</I> of fence surrounding a pool makes a difference. Comparison studies of perimeter fencing (property barrier) versus isolation fencing (around immediate pool area) show isolation fencing to be much more effective in reducing the risk of drowning (<LINK REF="REF-Wintemute-1990a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wintemute 1990a</LINK>). Adding to this finding are studies examining children's ability to climb certain types of fence (<LINK REF="REF-Nixon-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nixon 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rabinovich-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rabinovich 1994</LINK>). In particular, chain-link fences, while allowing visibility of the pool area, are the most easily scaled by children as young as two years old. Ornamental iron bar fences were advocated as a better barrier, with reduced 'climb ability' while retaining the visibility factor. Fence height makes little difference if the child is able to climb; one study showed the median time for four year olds to climb a five foot fence was 17 seconds (<LINK REF="REF-Nixon-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nixon 1979</LINK>). For a fence that is not scaleable, the most important element of fencing is a secure, self-closing gate. Taking these and other finding into account, the US Consumer Product Safety Commission has compiled a list of minimum recommendations (<LINK REF="REF-US-CPSC-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">US CPSC 1991</LINK>) for residential pool fencing. Recent legislation passed in Seattle, Washington, USA requires a fence height of at least five feet (1.5m), and an inter-bar spacing to be no more than four inches (10cm) (<LINK REF="REF-Quan-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Quan 1990</LINK>).</P>

<SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<CRIT_STUDIES>
<P>Studies eligible for review were controlled studies that evaluate the effectiveness of pool fencing using some type of comparison group, and provide relevant and interpretable data that objectively measure the risk of drowning or near drowning. The comparison could be to another group, whether it be part of a randomized controlled trial (RCT), a non-randomized controlled trial, a case-control study, a cohort study or an ecological study. Ecological studies either involve comparison across communities (ecological group study), or over time within a community as in a time series study or a before-after study (ecological time study). An ecological mixed study examines within-group changes and between-group changes. For example, such a study might compare drowning rates before and after passage of fencing legislation in State A, and also compare these data to mortality in State B, which has no such law during the entire period being examined.</P>

<DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>We independently screened the results of the searches. We then obtained the full text of the potentially relevant studies. In order to be included in this review, we required studies to have complete outcome/case ascertainment, accurate exposure measurement, appropriate selection of a comparison/control group and elimination or control of factors such as selection bias, observation bias, and confounding. For a cohort study, ascertainment of exposure and outcome had to be the same for all members of the cohort. Case-control studies were required to have equal ascertainment of the exposure for case and control groups. Additionally, controls had to have been selected from the same population from which the cases were derived. Methodologically acceptable ecological studies were required to include ascertainment of exposure, outcome, and measurement of potential confounders be the same for all members of the population. Studies that did not meet this methodological criteria were excluded from the review.</P>

</STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<STUDY_QUALITY>
<P>Major problems, encountered in all three of the studies, revolve around the selection of appropriate control/comparison groups, and measuring the exposure to pools of children in various age groups. </P>
<P>The Western Australia study (<LINK REF="STD-Intergov.-WA-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Intergov. WA 1988</LINK>) obtained data for the control/comparison group from a survey conducted in 1988, the end of the data collection period for the cases; it is not known whether the distribution of the two fencing types (perimeter and isolation) for pools in households with young children changed over the 13 year period. </P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Pitt-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Pitt 1991</LINK> did not specify whether the identified control households contained children, nor did he document their ages. </P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Fergusson-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Fergusson 1984</LINK> did not provide the age group distribution of the drowning cases or the control group. The control group for this study was appropriately obtained from a survey that identified the distribution of fenced and unfenced pools in the community; however, the proportion of children exposed to unfenced pools is unknown. </P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Pitt-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Pitt 1991</LINK> did limit his case group to children with unintended access to pools; however, there was not similar exposure information for the control group.<BR/> <BR/>One case-control study (<LINK REF="STD-Present-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Present 1987</LINK>), was excluded on methodological grounds - see Table of excluded studies.</P>
<P>None of the studies adjusted for the possible confounding influence of parental and child behavior. It is possible that parents who are more safety conscious would fence their pools and supervise their children more carefully.</P>
</STUDY_QUALITY>
<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
<P>The three case-control studies seem to indicate that pool fencing can reduce the risk of drowning. </P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Fergusson-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Fergusson 1984</LINK> compared the risk of drowning in a fenced pool with the risk in an unfenced pool; odds ratio (OR) was 0.29 (95% CI 0.16 to 0.55).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Intergov.-WA-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Intergov. WA 1988</LINK> compared isolation (enclosed pool on four sides) with perimeter fencing (three-sided fencing). The results indicate that isolation fencing is superior to perimeter fencing, OR for the risk of drowning was 0.17 (95% CI 0.07 to 0.44).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Pitt-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Pitt 1991</LINK> compared the risk of drowning and near-drowning in a fenced pool with the risk in an unfenced pool; OR was 0.27 (95% CI 0.15 to 0.47). For in-ground pools, the OR for the risk of drowning and near-drowning in a fenced pool was 0.24 (95% CI 0.13 to 0.48). For above ground pools, the OR for the risk of drowning and near-drowning in a fenced pool was 0.23 (95% CI 0.06 to 0.92).</P>
</INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>Case-control studies are well suited to evaluate pool fencing as an intervention to prevent pool drowning in children. Drowning is a rare outcome which makes cohort or interrupted times series designs difficult. The only randomized controlled trial (RCT) design which is feasible would be an RCT evaluating isolation versus perimeter fencing; however, this would be logistically difficult to carry out. </P>
<P>Measuring exposure is difficult and requires collecting information on the number of pools in the population and the age distribution of the population exposed to pools. <LINK REF="STD-Pearn-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Pearn 1979</LINK> has proposed an objective method called the Swimming Pool Drowning Index (SPDI), to evaluate the effect of fencing legislation changes and educational initiatives. This formula adjusts for population distribution and home pool installation changes over time The SPDI is calculated as follows: (No. of pool fatalities/No. of children at risk) x (No. of private pools/No. of private dwellings) (<LINK REF="STD-Intergov.-WA-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Intergov. WA 1988</LINK>). Due to the small number of drownings in a given year, the index is more stable if calculated over a multi-year period of time; cases should be grouped in five year segments to obtain stable rates for comparison. More complete data collection systems are needed to calculate a reliable SPDI. Since drownings are an infrequent occurrence the addition of near-drowning cases would make evaluation of interventions easier. However, in most areas reporting of near-drownings is incomplete. The direction of this ascertainment bias would depend on the distribution of the unreported near drowning cases between fenced and unfenced pools.</P>
<P>Two recent studies evaluating pool fencing ordinances in Los Angeles County and Queensland, Australia indicate that the mere passage of legislation is not sufficient to reduce drowning. In Los Angeles, 81% of all child drownings occurred in pools that were regulated by pool fencing ordinances; odds ratio = 1.27 (95% CI 0.72 to 2.25) comparing presence of fencing ordinance to absence of fencing ordinance. However, the local ordinances did not require four-sided fencing. Additionally, there was inadequate enforcement of the ordinance and poor maintenance of pool barriers (<LINK REF="STD-Morganstern-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Morganstern 2000</LINK>). In Queensland, deaths decreased from 12 per year (1982 to 1991) to two per year (1992 to 1994) but increased to 11 per year three years later (1995 to 1997). Eighty-seven percent (33/38) of pools where children drowned did not comply with fencing legislation (<LINK REF="STD-Pitt-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Pitt 1998</LINK>). Opponents of pool fencing legislation argue that parents or caregivers should increase pool safety by increased vigilance and control when children are present. A small study from Queensland provides evidence that caregiver factors may be inadequate to prevent toddler drownings (<LINK REF="REF-Fisher-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fisher 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>The recommendations of three studies evaluating fencing legislation in Western Australia (<LINK REF="STD-Stevenson-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Stevenson 2003</LINK>), New South Wales (<LINK REF="REF-van-Weerdenburg-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Weerdenburg 2006</LINK>), and Queensland (<LINK REF="REF-QUISU-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">QUISU 2006</LINK>) include improving pool fencing legislation, requiring inspection and efficient enforcement protocols to increase compliance with legislation. Emphasis is placed on adequate four-sided fencing, secure gates, and public education.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>Isolation fencing with dynamic self-latching gates is an effective environmental intervention that reduces unintended access to pools and reduces the risk of drowning for preschool children. Legislation accompanied by educational campaigns should be implemented for all public, semi- private and private swimming pools. Legislation should require fencing of both newly constructed and existing pools and include enforcement provisions, in order to be effective.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Additional case-control studies are needed to provide a more precise estimate of the protective effect of fencing. The study design should use pools as the unit of analysis. Pools in which a young child drowns would be considered cases and other pools where no drowning occurred would be considered controls. Information would be collected on exposure to pools for children of various ages in the case and control groups. This would allow for controlling for the degree to which each pool is exposed to a young child in the home on the owner's property.</P>
<P>Studies examining fencing enforcement might allude to better fencing legislation. Specifically, a study comparing types of fencing legislation and their policies (fines, periodic inspections etc) would be important in determining the most effective and practical means of enforcement for a given community. Updating and maintenance of existing databases of drownings, near-drownings, number of private and public pools, fencing types, and regulations is the most important element in ascertaining the effectiveness of, not only fencing type, but also any other intervention.</P>

No numerator data provided and it was not clear which denominator was used, the average 12 year population of children under five or the population for 1999.</P>

<TITLE>Relevance of the review to developing countries</TITLE>
<DATE_SUBMITTED>
<DATE DAY="" MONTH="" YEAR=""/>
</DATE_SUBMITTED>
<FEEDBACK_SUMMARY>
<P>Potential relevance of this review to developing countries.</P>
<P>I wonder if the authors have considered the relevance of protecting exposed water to safety in developing countries. Myaux et al. in Bull WHO 1997; 75:533-539 examine the effect of flood control embankment of total mortality in children 1-5 years. This included direct protection (death rates from accidental drowning) and indirect (death rates from infectious diseases). </P>
<P>I certify that I have no affiliations with or involvement in any organisation or entity with a direct financial interest in the subject matter of my criticisms</P>
</FEEDBACK_SUMMARY>
<FEEDBACK_REPLY>
<P>A new review is currently underway, entitled 'Interventions for the prevention of drowning', which will include studies of measures to physically separate people from water and engineering modifications to aid exit from areas of water. The citation mentioned has been forwarded to the Reviewer who is preparing this review.</P>
