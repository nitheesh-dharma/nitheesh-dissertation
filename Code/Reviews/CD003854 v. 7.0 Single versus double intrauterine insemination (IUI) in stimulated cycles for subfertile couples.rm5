<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2008-05-13 14:51:02 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="jane clarke">
<P>Undertaking intrauterine insemination (IUI) twice in a menstrual cycle instead of the usual single attempt has been shown to increase pregnancy rates. IUI places sperm directly into the uterus and therefore close to any egg(s). The insemination is less stressful, invasive and expensive than in vitro fertilisation and similar procedures. It is therefore often used when a male partner is subfertile, or when the reason for not becoming pregnant is unknown. Generally, IUI is carried out once in a menstrual cycle, but it is sometimes attempted twice (double IUI). The review revealed that, in trials of IUI (where fertility drugs to stimulate the release of eggs are also used), double IUI has resulted in more pregnancies than single IUI.</P>

<P>Intrauterine insemination, with or without controlled ovarian hyperstimulation, is one of the treatment modalities offered to couples who have tried to conceive for at least one year (subfertile couples).

<BODY MODIFIED="2008-05-15 11:39:49 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="jane clarke">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-05-13 15:26:37 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="jane clarke">
<P>The usual definition of subfertility is couples who have tried to conceive for at least one year. This is approximately 10% of couples who try to conceive (<LINK REF="REF-Beurskens-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beurskens 1995</LINK>). Subfertility is considered unexplained when routine fertility evaluation does not show any abnormality (<LINK REF="REF-Crosignani-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Crosignani 1996</LINK>). Couples with male subfertility have repeated semen analyses below the criteria for normal semen as defined by the World Health Organization (WHO) (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1992</LINK>). Subfertility diagnoses also include mild endometriosis, ovulatory dysfunction and cervical factor. In spite of significant advances in the field of reproductive medicine there are still opportunities for optimising treatment modalities (<LINK REF="REF-Allen-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Allen 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zayed-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zayed 1997</LINK>).<BR/>
<BR/>Intrauterine insemination (IUI), with or without controlled ovarian hyperstimulation (COH), is one of the treatment modalities offered most often to subfertile couples because it is less stressful, invasive and expensive than interventions such as in vitro fertilisation and gamete intrafallopian transfer (<LINK REF="REF-Guzick-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guzick 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Karande-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Karande 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ombelet-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ombelet 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Peterson-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Peterson 1994</LINK>). In IUI, motile spermatozoa are directly transferred into the uterine cavity, after sperm preparation and concentration in a small volume of medium. Mild ovarian hyperstimulation improves the probability of conception by increasing the number of available oocytes and correcting subtle cycle disorders (<LINK REF="REF-Arici-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Arici 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Murdoch-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Murdoch 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nulsen-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nulsen 1993</LINK>). IUI combined with ovarian hyperstimulation has been proved effective in couples with unexplained subfertility and may be considered as one of the first treatments in this group (<LINK REF="REF-Chung-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chung 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Goverde-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goverde 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hughes-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hughes 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Verhulst-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Verhulst 2006</LINK>). In male subfertility, IUI has also been proved effective (<LINK REF="REF-Bensdorp-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bensdorp 2007</LINK>). The addition of mild ovarian hyperstimulation seems to be effective in couples with a minor semen defect only (<LINK REF="REF-Cohlen-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cohlen 1998</LINK>).<BR/>
<BR/>Some authors have suggested that increasing the number of inseminations per cycle from one to two may increase the probability of conception, although there has been no consensus in the literature (<LINK REF="STD-Ransom-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Ransom 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Silverberg-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Silverberg 1992</LINK>). Compared with a single IUI, a second consecutive IUI adds significantly to the cost and psychological burden, making it important to confirm its beneficial effect before recommending this procedure on a large scale (<LINK REF="STD-Ragni-1999a" TYPE="STUDY">Ragni 1999a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ragni-1999b" TYPE="STUDY">Ragni 1999b</LINK>).<BR/>
<BR/>When IUI is performed, adequate timing is a matter of paramount importance. It is possible that differences in outcomes may relate partly to the timing of insemination rather than single versus double IUI per se. The optimal timing of insemination should be investigated in a separate systematic review.<BR/>
<BR/>The aim of this systematic review is to investigate the issue of single IUI versus double IUI using the results of randomised controlled trials.</P>

<P>Subfertile couples undergoing IUI defined as couples who have tried to conceive for at least one year.</P>
<P>We considered a variety of causes for subfertility, including unexplained subfertility, male subfertility, mild endometriosis, cervical factor and ovulatory dysfunction. Subfertility is regarded as unexplained when routine fertility evaluation does not show any abnormality. Couples with male subfertility have repeated semen analysis results below the criteria for normal semen as defined by the WHO (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1992</LINK>). Trials performed before 1992 were based on the 1987 WHO criteria. Recent trials might have used strict criteria for defining sperm morphology (more than 14% is considered normal) (<LINK REF="REF-Kruger-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kruger 1993</LINK>).<BR/>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Statistical analysis</HEADING>
<P>We performed statistical analyses in accordance with the guidelines developed by the Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group.<BR/>We noted heterogeneity between the results of different studies and cautiously explored this by inspecting the scatter in the data points and the overlap in their confidence intervals (CIs) and, more formally, by checking the results of the chi-squared tests and the I-squared (I<SUP>2</SUP>) statistic for inconsistency. The cut-off levels we used were: for an I<SUP>2</SUP> value below 30% a fixed-effect model was used; and for a I<SUP>2</SUP> above 60% a random-effects model was used. Between 30% and 60% our choice of model was based on differences between the included studies. If included high quality randomised controlled trials used comparable patients we used the fixed-effect model. We determined all possible contributions of trial design to heterogeneity.<BR/>
<BR/>For dichotomous data, we expressed the results as odds ratios (ORs) with 95% CIs and combined data for meta-analysis with RevMan software using the Peto method and a fixed-effect model. Continuous data were combined for meta-analysis with RevMan software using the weighted mean difference with 95% CI and a fixed-effect model.<BR/>
<BR/>The outcome of an ongoing pregnancy is considered a positive consequence of treatment; thus, a higher proportion of women with a pregnancy is considered a benefit. Increased odds (to the right of the vertical line in the graphs) signifies a relative benefit of double insemination. For adverse outcomes such as miscarriage, OHSS and multiple pregnancy, which are negative consequences, higher numbers are considered to be detrimental (increased odds signifies relative harm). This requires to be taken into consideration when the summary graphs are viewed.<BR/>
<BR/>For missing data, we made attempts to contact the investigators. When missing data could not be obtained, we had intended that assumptions used in the extraction and analysis of the data would be explained. This was not necessary because no assumptions were made.<BR/>
<BR/>A priori, we had planned to perform separate subgroup analyses for trials comparing single versus double IUI using different timing protocols, trials in which donor insemination was used, and trials with clearly concealed allocation. We considered that at least five studies were needed to undertake a subgroup analysis.<BR/>
<BR/>Where there were multiple arms in a study with a common placebo, we divided the placebo numbers equally between the arms. If the control group consisted of an uneven number (as was the case with <LINK REF="STD-Ragni-1999a" TYPE="STUDY">Ragni 1999a</LINK>) so that the numbers could not be equally divided, we carried out the analysis both ways to detect possible differences in the results caused by unequal division of the numerator and denominator. Our main aim in this systematic review was to compare single versus double IUI. We therefore preferred to take the results of the two double groups together, even though they had different timing protocols.<BR/>
<BR/>A priori, we also planned to perform sensitivity analysis if more than 10 trials were included in the review in order to examine the stability of the results in relation to:<BR/>(1) clearly concealed allocation versus unclearly concealed allocation;<BR/>(2) trials using the partner&#8217;s semen compared with trials using donor semen;<BR/>(3) male subfertility versus unexplained subfertility.<BR/>
<BR/>However, these analyses were not possible because only six trials were included.<BR/>
<BR/>It is the intention of the reviewers that a new search for randomised controlled trials will be performed every two years and the review updated accordingly.</P>

<RESULTS>
<STUDY_DESCRIPTION MODIFIED="2008-05-15 11:38:51 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="jane clarke">
<P>When this review was first published, we identified 33 studies using the adopted search strategy, immediately excluding 20 because their titles and abstracts very clearly did not meet our basic inclusion criteria. Thirteen of these studies potentially contained data comparing single versus double insemination per cycle. Our further evaluation based on the inclusion criteria identified three trials as eligible for inclusion. When updating this review, we performed the search again and six additional articles were found, of which three were eligible for inclusion. The two researchers were in full agreement concerning inclusion or exclusion of these trials.

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Excluded studies</HEADING>
<P>Eleven studies failed to meet the inclusion criteria for the reasons outlined in the table &#8217;Characteristics of excluded studies&#8217;. Eight trials did not use a random design to compare single with double IUI. Two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Alborzi-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Alborzi 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ransom-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Ransom 1994</LINK>) were excluded owing to their cross-over design. Finally, one study by Liu and co-workers (<LINK REF="STD-Liu-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Liu 2005</LINK>) was excluded since this was an abstract of their included publication from 2006 (<LINK REF="STD-Liu-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Liu 2006</LINK>).

<P>One study is awaiting assessment (<LINK REF="STD-Karlstrom-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Karlstrom 2000</LINK>). We made an attempt to contact the authors  for further information and data to determine its eligibility, but no reply has yet been received. In this study, 118 of 151 cycles used direct intraperitoneal injection instead of IUI. When separate data for the 33 cycles using IUI can be retrieved, this trial may be found to meet our inclusion criteria.

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Participants</HEADING>
<P>The six included studies comprised 1785 women and a total of 2072 cycles. One trial did not mention the number of women in each treatment group (<LINK REF="STD-Silverberg-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Silverberg 1992</LINK>). Couples included in the studies suffered from unexplained subfertility or male subfertility. In two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Casadei-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Casadei 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Silverberg-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Silverberg 1992</LINK>) other types of subfertility (ovulatory dysfunction, endometriosis and cervical factor) were also included. Ages of the female participants were stated in all but one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Zeyneloglu-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Zeyneloglu 2002</LINK>) and one study (<LINK REF="STD-Liu-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Liu 2006</LINK>) gave age per type of subfertility instead of per treatment group. The mean age ranged from 32 to 34.9 years, which was similar in all trials and in both treatment groups. None of the studies reported ages of male partners. The mean duration of subfertility was stated in three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Casadei-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Casadei 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Liu-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Liu 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ng-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ng 2003</LINK>), this being comparable. None of the studies mentioned previous fertility treatment. Ng and co-workers reported the number of couples with secondary subfertility.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Interventions</HEADING>
<P>Three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Casadei-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Casadei 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ng-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ng 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Silverberg-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Silverberg 1992</LINK>) used gonadotropins (recombinant follicle-stimulating hormone and human menopausal gonadotropin respectively) for ovarian hyperstimulation, while other studies used CC alone (<LINK REF="STD-Zeyneloglu-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Zeyneloglu 2002</LINK>) or combined with gonadotropins (<LINK REF="STD-Liu-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Liu 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ragni-1999a" TYPE="STUDY">Ragni 1999a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ragni-1999b" TYPE="STUDY">Ragni 1999b</LINK>). In all studies, ovarian hyperstimulation was followed by hCG injection. Three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Casadei-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Casadei 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ng-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ng 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ragni-1999a" TYPE="STUDY">Ragni 1999a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ragni-1999b" TYPE="STUDY">Ragni 1999b</LINK>) reported cancel criteria varying from more than three follicles larger than 16 mm (<LINK REF="STD-Ng-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ng 2003</LINK>) to more than six follicles larger than 14 mm (<LINK REF="STD-Ragni-1999a" TYPE="STUDY">Ragni 1999a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ragni-1999b" TYPE="STUDY">Ragni 1999b</LINK>). All studies used partners&#8217; semen, although the study by <LINK REF="STD-Silverberg-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Silverberg 1992</LINK> also used cryopreserved donor semen in a small number of cycles. In nine of the total 49 cycles, cryopreserved donor semen was used, of which four were randomly assigned to single IUI treatment and five to double IUI treatment. All three pregnancies resulting from the use of cryopreserved sperm occurred in cycles in which two inseminations had been performed. Sperm preparation was by the swim-up technique in two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Casadei-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Casadei 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zeyneloglu-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Zeyneloglu 2002</LINK>) and the other four used a two-layer density gradient. Two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Casadei-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Casadei 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ng-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ng 2003</LINK>) reported the use of luteal phase support with either progesterone tablets or hCG injections.<BR/>
<BR/>The timing of single insemination varied only slightly; two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Casadei-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Casadei 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zeyneloglu-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Zeyneloglu 2002</LINK>) performed single IUI 36 hours after hCG and the others 34 hours after hCG.<BR/>
<BR/>The timing of double insemination varied more between the studies. Two research groups (<LINK REF="STD-Liu-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Liu 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ng-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ng 2003</LINK>) inseminated the first time between 18 and 24 hours after hCG and the second time between 36 and 48 hours after hCG. Two others (<LINK REF="STD-Silverberg-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Silverberg 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zeyneloglu-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Zeyneloglu 2002</LINK>) inseminated 18 and 42 hours after hCG, which falls in the same time interval as the two previous studies. Finally, Casadei and co-workers (2006) inseminated 12 and 36 hours after hCG; and Ragni and co-workers (1999a,b) inseminated 12 and 34 hours after hCG and also reported a third group in which the second insemination was performed 34 and 60 hours after hCG.</P>

<P>None of the studies reported live birth rates. All except one study (<LINK REF="STD-Silverberg-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Silverberg 1992</LINK>) assessed pregnancy rate per couple, and all trials assessed pregnancy rate per cycle.  Four (<LINK REF="STD-Casadei-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Casadei 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Liu-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Liu 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ng-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ng 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ragni-1999a" TYPE="STUDY">Ragni 1999a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ragni-1999b" TYPE="STUDY">Ragni 1999b</LINK>) reported multiple pregnancies.

<P>Overall six studies were selected that compared single IUI with double IUI. The Ragni study compared a single insemination with two different timing protocols of double insemination. For the purpose of this review, this study was therefore divided into two intervention groups, 'a' and 'b'. <LINK REF="STD-Ragni-1999a" TYPE="STUDY">Ragni 1999a</LINK> performed double IUI after 12 and 34 hours and <LINK REF="STD-Ragni-1999b" TYPE="STUDY">Ragni 1999b</LINK> performed double IUI after 34 and 60 hours. To each treatment group, half of the control single IUI group was assigned in order to allow both treatment arms of the study to be included in the meta-analysis. This made it possible to detect the results of each treatment group separately, as well as the overall result by pooling them.</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2008-05-13 16:37:36 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="jane clarke">
<P>In the first version of this review, we concluded that large high-quality randomised trials were lacking and therefore firm conclusions could not be drawn. In this update, one large prospective trial (<LINK REF="STD-Liu-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Liu 2006</LINK>) could be included, comprising more than 60% of the couples in the meta-analysis and revealing a statistically significant higher pregnancy rate per couple when double insemination was performed.<BR/>
<BR/>However, this effect was seen only in couples suffering from mild male subfertility. It was explained by the authors (<LINK REF="STD-Liu-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Liu 2006</LINK>) by the fact that they included only mild male factor subfertility with a total sperm count of 10-20 × 10<SUP>6</SUP> per mL. However, this does not explain the difference that exists between male subfertility and unexplained subfertility, since mild male factor and unexplained subfertility are almost the same entity.<BR/>
<BR/>It is remarkable that the pregnancy rates in the male subfertility group were as high as with in vitro fertilisation, which could be difficult to reproduce in future research. Furthermore, the total number of spermatozoa inseminated differed significantly between the male subfertility group and the unexplained subfertility group, with significantly more motile spermatozoa inseminated in the idiopathic subfertility group. In cases of male subfertility, the spermatozoa probably survive for an even shorter time in the female genital tract compared with normal sperm (<LINK REF="REF-Cohlen-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cohlen 1998</LINK>). Although with double insemination a greater total number of spermatozoa are inseminated, the pregnancy rates were not related to sperm concentration in the 2006 study of Liu and co-workers. Altogether, there is no good explanation of why more pregnancies were seen in the male subfertility group in the <LINK REF="STD-Liu-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Liu 2006</LINK> study.<BR/>
<BR/>Ideally, subgroup analysis should be performed for each cause of subfertility, but only two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Casadei-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Casadei 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Liu-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Liu 2006</LINK>) reported results per cause of subfertility.<BR/>
<BR/>Other methodological problems with the trials include: lack of sufficient power and no intention to treat analysis or power analysis. Besides this, each trial used different protocols for ovarian hyperstimulation, different timing of insemination and different semen preparation, which might have introduced clinical heterogeneity.<BR/>
<BR/>Another review (<LINK REF="REF-Osuna-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Osuna 2004</LINK>) concluded that ovarian hyperstimulation with CC resulted in significantly higher pregnancy rates in double compared with single insemination. This was not seen with gonadotropin stimulated cycles in the same review. A reason for this difference could be a reduced number of available oocytes at the moment of insemination when using CC, in which case two inseminations would be beneficial. In our review, one study stimulated with CC alone (<LINK REF="STD-Zeyneloglu-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Zeyneloglu 2002</LINK>) did not reveal a significantly better effect for double insemination.<BR/>
<BR/>More aggressive ovarian stimulation leads to more dominant follicles, which influences treatment outcomes, with higher pregnancy rates, and more side effects such as multiple pregnancies and OHSS. Studies that demonstrated a significant effect of double insemination (<LINK REF="STD-Liu-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Liu 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ragni-1999a" TYPE="STUDY">Ragni 1999a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Silverberg-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Silverberg 1992</LINK>) reported a mean of three dominant follicles larger than 15 mm compared with a mean of 1.7 dominant follicles in the studies that did not report a significant difference between single and double insemination (<LINK REF="STD-Casadei-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Casadei 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ng-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ng 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ragni-1999b" TYPE="STUDY">Ragni 1999b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zeyneloglu-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Zeyneloglu 2002</LINK>). Only Silverberg and co-workers reported a significantly higher mean number of follicles (larger than 16 mm) in the group receiving double insemination.<BR/>
<BR/>One can conclude that double insemination may be effective only when more dominant follicles are available and which rupture at different intervals after administering hCG.<BR/>
<BR/>The timing of single and double inseminations was slightly different in each study included. The optimal timing of IUI has been discussed extensively by other authors (<LINK REF="REF-Guzick-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guzick 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ragni-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ragni 2004</LINK>). Andersen and co-workers found that approximately 38 hours after hCG administration the largest follicle ruptures (<LINK REF="REF-Andersen-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Andersen 1995</LINK>). This suggests that the optimal timing for insemination would be around 38 hours after hCG administration. Claman and co-workers performed a randomised trial comparing IUI after 32 to 34 and 38 to 40 hours, reporting no significant difference in pregnancy rates (<LINK REF="REF-Claman-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Claman 2004</LINK>). Huang and co-workers performed a prospective non-randomised trial comparing different timing protocols for IUI after hCG (26 to 28 hours versus 36 to 38 hours), which gave similar results (<LINK REF="REF-Huang-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Huang 2000</LINK>). Thus, it can be hypothesised that an optimal window of several hours seems to exist in which IUI can be performed. How large this window is and when it begins and ends needs to be further investigated.<BR/>
<BR/>Finally, different techniques were used for semen preparation (swim-up or gradient techniques), which have similar pregnancy rate results (<LINK REF="REF-Boomsma-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boomsma 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Carrell-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carrell 1998</LINK>). A study by <LINK REF="REF-Hornstein-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hornstein 1992</LINK> reported significant decreases in semen volume, sperm concentration and sperm motility in semen samples obtained on the second day of consecutive-day inseminations. Sperm-washing procedures cannot overcome this natural reduction in semen quality produced by frequent ejaculation. Conclusively, a second insemination in the same cycle may not be as effective as the first. Apart from this, fertilisation with sperm of compromised quality, used in cases of male subfertility, can result in clinical pregnancy but could possibly result in a higher rate of miscarriage and eventually a lower rate of live birth than expected on the grounds of clinical pregnancy rates. Unfortunately, no current data are available in the literature to confirm this hypothesis.<BR/>
<BR/>A second IUI in the same cycle will add to the cost of treatment, but it may be cost-effective if the number needed to treat with double IUI is low. The number needed to treat we calculated from the data of Liu and co-workers was 81.<BR/>A formal cost-benefit analysis was not carried out by any of the authors of the included studies. In one trial report (<LINK REF="STD-Ragni-1999a" TYPE="STUDY">Ragni 1999a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ragni-1999b" TYPE="STUDY">Ragni 1999b</LINK>), the authors mentioned the approximate cycle costs of single and double IUI per cycle. <LINK REF="REF-Goverde-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goverde 2000</LINK> and co-workers reported the exact costs of IUI treatment. These costs, given per pregnancy resulting in at least one live birth, were USD4511 to 5710. Nevertheless, no information was given on the cost of an additional IUI in the same cycle.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2008-05-15 11:39:49 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="jane clarke">
<P>There is evidence that double IUI gives rise to higher pregnancy rates in subfertile couples. This conclusion is based on the results of five small randomised trials and one larger trial (<LINK REF="STD-Liu-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Liu 2006</LINK>). Double insemination seems to be more effective for couples suffering from mild male subfertility and when more dominant follicles are available. However, sufficient data for subgroup analysis for different types of subfertility was not available.  Thus, it could not be concluded whether double insemination should only be performed for male subfertility or when ovarian hyperstimulation is done with clomiphene citrate (CC). To offer advice regarding clinical practice, further research is warranted.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2008-05-13 15:27:12 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="jane clarke">
<P>Many fertility trials lack good methodology, partially as a result of small treatment groups, difficulties with blinding because insemination is an invasive procedure, different clinical protocols, and failure to express pregnancy outcomes or live births per couple. Adherence to the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) guidelines  (<LINK REF="REF-Moher-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 2001</LINK>) would result in massive improvement.<BR/>
<BR/>Research in the fertility field is also difficult because of the many possible confounding factors that introduce differences between studies and treatment groups. Important factors such as inclusion criteria, exclusion criteria, type of subfertility, duration of subfertility, and previous fertility treatment, which influence the chance of becoming pregnant, are often not mentioned in trial reports.<BR/>
<BR/>Appropriate outcome measures also need to be used in trials. Pregnancy rate per cycle is reported in most published trials, however pregnancy rate per couple, ongoing pregnancy rate per couple, and live birth rate per couple would be more appropriate. Live birth should be the most important outcome because this represents the final goal of treatment. Apart from this, miscarriage rate and ectopic pregnancy rate should be reported to detect the effect caused by sperm of compromised quality. The cost-effectiveness of double IUI remains a matter for debate, which should be an important element in future randomised trials.<BR/>
<BR/>Suggestion for further clinical studies:<BR/>(1) Single versus double IUI for male subfertility or unexplained subfertility, with stratification for each group of subfertility;<BR/>(2) Single versus double IUI for male subfertility; stimulation with CC versus stimulation with gonadotrophins using stratification for each ovarian hyperstimulation;<BR/>(3) Optimal timing interval for single insemination (12 versus 36 hours after hCG);<BR/>(4) Optimal timing interval for double insemination (12 versus 12 plus 36 hours after hCG;)<BR/>(5) Cost-effectivity studies are necessary for each comparison.</P>
