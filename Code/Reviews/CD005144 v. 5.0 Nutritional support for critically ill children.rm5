<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2016-05-07 19:30:07 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is little evidence to support or refute the need to provide nutrition to critically ill children in a paediatric intensive care unit during the first week of their critical illness.</P>
<P>Giving nutrition in the form of tube feeding (enteral) or intravenous feeding (parenteral) is often considered a priority during critical illness in children. There are reasons to think this may not necessarily be true. During critical illness the body's metabolism is changed and the need for calories is reduced. There are known side effects from giving too much nutrition, such as delays in being able to take the child off a respiratory ventilator, liver problems, and worsened inflammation.</P>
<P>We found only one small randomized controlled trial that compared early feeding (within 24 hours of injury) with conventional feeding (after at least 48 hours). The trial showed no differences between the groups for any of the outcomes examined. Further research in this area is urgently needed to help guide optimal treatment of children with critical illness. In a recent search update (February 2016) we identified a protocol for a relevant randomized controlled study; however, no results have yet been published.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2016-05-24 13:59:27 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>Nutritional support in the critically ill child has not been well investigated and is a controversial topic within paediatric intensive care. There are no clear guidelines as to the best form or timing of nutrition in critically ill infants and children. This is an update of a review that was originally published in 2009. .</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2016-05-24 13:59:27 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>The objective of this review was to assess the impact of enteral and parenteral nutrition given in the first week of illness on clinically important outcomes in critically ill children. There were two primary hypotheses:</P>
<P>1. the mortality rate of critically ill children fed enterally or parenterally is different to that of children who are given no nutrition;<BR/>2. the mortality rate of critically ill children fed enterally is different to that of children fed parenterally.</P>
<P>We planned to conduct subgroup analyses, pending available data, to examine whether the treatment effect was altered by:</P>
<P>a. age (infants less than one year versus children greater than or equal to one year old);<BR/>b. type of patient (medical, where purpose of admission to intensive care unit (ICU) is for medical illness (without surgical intervention immediately prior to admission), versus surgical, where purpose of admission to ICU is for postoperative care or care after trauma).</P>
<P>We also proposed the following secondary hypotheses (a priori), pending other clinical trials becoming available, to examine nutrition more distinctly:</P>
<P>3. the mortality rate is different in children who are given enteral nutrition alone versus enteral and parenteral combined;<BR/>4. the mortality rate is different in children who are given both enteral feeds and parenteral nutrition versus no nutrition.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2016-05-24 14:02:32 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>In this updated review we searched: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2016, Issue 2); Ovid MEDLINE (1966 to February 2016); Ovid EMBASE (1988 to February 2016); OVID Evidence-Based Medicine Reviews; ISI Web of Science - Science Citation Index Expanded (1965 to February 2016); WebSPIRS Biological Abstracts (1969 to February 2016); and WebSPIRS CAB Abstracts (1972 to February 2016). We also searched trial registries, reviewed reference lists of all potentially relevant studies, handsearched relevant conference proceedings, and contacted experts in the area and manufacturers of enteral and parenteral nutrition products<I>. </I>We did not limit the search by language or publication status. </P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2016-05-24 13:59:27 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>We included studies if they were randomized controlled trials; involved paediatric patients, aged one day to 18 years of age, who were cared for in a paediatric intensive care unit setting (PICU) and had received nutrition within the first seven days of admission; and reported data for at least one of the pre-specified outcomes (30-day or PICU mortality; length of stay in PICU or hospital; number of ventilator days; and morbid complications, such as nosocomial infections). We excluded studies if they only reported nutritional outcomes, quality of life assessments, or economic implications. Furthermore, we did not address other areas of paediatric nutrition, such as immunonutrition and different routes of delivering enteral nutrition, in this review.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2016-05-24 13:59:27 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>Two authors independently screened the searches, applied the inclusion criteria, and performed 'Risk of bias' assessments. We resolved discrepancies through discussion and consensus. One author extracted data and a second checked data for accuracy and completeness. We graded the evidence based on the following domains: study limitations, consistency of effect, imprecision, indirectness, and publication bias.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-05-24 13:59:27 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>We identified only one trial as relevant. Seventy-seven children in intensive care with burns involving more than 25% of the total body surface area were randomized to either enteral nutrition within 24 hours or after at least 48 hours. No statistically significant differences were observed for mortality, sepsis, ventilator days, length of stay, unexpected adverse events, resting energy expenditure, nitrogen balance, or albumin levels. We assessed the trial as having unclear risk of bias. We consider the quality of the evidence to be very low due to there being only one small trial. In the most recent search update we identified a protocol for a relevant randomized controlled trial examining the impact of withholding early parenteral nutrition completing enteral nutrition in pediatric critically ill patients; no results have been published.</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2009-01-22 09:37:14 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There was only one randomized trial relevant to the review question. Research is urgently needed to identify best practices regarding the timing and forms of nutrition for critically ill infants and children.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2016-05-24 13:59:27 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>Nutritional support in the critically ill child has not been well investigated and is a controversial topic in paediatric critical care medicine. There are no clear guidelines for the optimal timing and form of nutritional support in these children. There are several lines of evidence that suggest further investigation is required into whether any form of nutritional support is beneficial in the first week of critical illness in children, and these are discussed below. </P>
<P>We have defined nutritional support as the provision of energy in the form of glucose, protein, or lipid to provide calories and substrate for metabolism. Metabolic support can be defined as provision of these calories at basal metabolic rate, without any intention of supporting anabolic activities such as growth or activities of daily living. Accordingly, metabolic support is a form of nutritional support. For the purposes of this review, we defined critical illness as any illness requiring admission to a paediatric intensive care unit.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Metabolism during critical illness</HEADING>
<P>Critical illness often results in altered cellular energy metabolism (<LINK REF="REF-Fink-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fink 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Joffe-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Joffe 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mizock-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mizock 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Protti-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Protti 2006</LINK>). Although the mechanisms and exact alterations are poorly understood, it is clear that protein catabolism and mitochondrial dysfunctions with metabolic suppression can occur (<LINK REF="REF-Joffe-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Joffe 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mizock-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mizock 1984</LINK>). The suggestion that an increased metabolic rate occurs in adults with critical illness has been questioned (<LINK REF="REF-Miles-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Miles 2006</LINK>). Similarly, the metabolic rate measured in children with critical illness is most often at or below the predicted basal metabolic rate in the first week of illness (<LINK REF="REF-Avitzur-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Avitzur 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Briassoulis-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Briassoulis 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Framson-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Framson 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jacsik-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jacsik 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Letton-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Letton 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Martinez-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Martinez 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Oosterveld-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oosterveld 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-White-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">White 2000</LINK>); anabolism (with growth) does not occur (<LINK REF="REF-Chwals-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chwals 1994</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Underfeeding and overfeeding during critical illness</HEADING>
<P>Overfeeding has important adverse effects during critical illness (<LINK REF="REF-Chwals-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chwals 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zaloga-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zaloga 1994</LINK>). Excess carbohydrate intake can increase carbon dioxide production and impede ventilator weaning (<LINK REF="REF-Chwals-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chwals 1994</LINK>). Excess protein does not prevent catabolism and can even increase catabolism of body protein (<LINK REF="REF-Chwals-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chwals 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shew-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shew 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stroud-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stroud 2007</LINK>). High calorific intake can increase fat deposition, including in the liver (<LINK REF="REF-Chwals-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chwals 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hart-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hart 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zaloga-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zaloga 1994</LINK>). In animal models, lower calorific goals were associated with weight loss and improved survival from critical illness (<LINK REF="REF-Alexander-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alexander 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Yamazaki-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yamazaki 1986</LINK>). Some adult human studies suggest that underfeeding during critical illness is associated with improved survival and reduced length of stay in hospital (<LINK REF="REF-Ash-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ash 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Boitano-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boitano 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Dickerson-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dickerson 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jeejeebhoy-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jeejeebhoy 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Krishnan-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Krishnan 2003</LINK>). This is compatible with the finding in many types of animals that a 30% to 50% restriction of calories increases their lifespan and resistance to diseases of aging and oxidative damage (with similar pathophysiology to critical illness inflammatory cascades) (<LINK REF="REF-Bordone-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bordone 2005</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Adult nutritional trials during critical illness</HEADING>
<P>There have been several systematic reviews of nutritional support in critically ill adults. Koretz et al found no compelling evidence that enteral nutrition improved outcomes in critically ill adults when compared to no treatment or parenteral nutrition (<LINK REF="REF-Koretz-2007a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Koretz 2007a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Koretz-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Koretz 2007</LINK>). Koretz found no evidence that parenteral nutrition had an effect on clinical outcomes compared to not providing artificial nutrition (<LINK REF="REF-Koretz-2007b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Koretz 2007b</LINK>). A consensus statement published by the American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition in 1997 pointed out that "although it has been assumed that nutrition support is clinically beneficial in this [critically ill] patient population, this hypothesis has not been tested by well-designed clinical trials..." (<LINK REF="REF-Klein-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Klein 1997</LINK>). This was reaffirmed, in 2002, with the statement that "It appears reasonable to recommend that some form of supplemental nutritional support be started after 5 to 10 days of fasting in patients who are likely to remain unable to eat for an additional week or more" (<LINK REF="REF-ASPEN-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">ASPEN 2002</LINK>). Canadian researchers have published systematic reviews showing that parenteral nutrition was associated with more infectious complications than enteral nutrition (<LINK REF="REF-Gramlich-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gramlich 2004</LINK>); parenteral nutrition did not improve clinically important outcomes compared to standard care (<LINK REF="REF-Heyland-1998a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heyland 1998a</LINK>); and combined parenteral and enteral nutrition did not improve clinically important outcomes in critically ill adults compared to enteral nutrition alone (<LINK REF="REF-Dhaliwal-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dhaliwal 2004</LINK>). Others have found poor evidence that early enteral nutrition is better than early parenteral nutrition (<LINK REF="REF-Peter-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Peter 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Simpson-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Simpson 2005</LINK>), although this is controversial (<LINK REF="REF-Heyland-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heyland 2003</LINK>). Part of the reason for the controversy is that many of the trials were not of optimal quality (<LINK REF="REF-Preiser-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Preiser 2003</LINK>). "The point at which 'safe' starvation ends and malnutrition-related complications begin has yet to be defined" (<LINK REF="REF-Preiser-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Preiser 2003</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Surrogate outcomes</HEADING>
<P>Many clinicians have assumed that early nutritional support is required for critically ill children and adults. Malnutrition is associated with poor outcomes and nutritional support can improve surrogate nutritional outcomes, such as immune function, wound healing, and measured proteins (<LINK REF="REF-Briassoulis-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Briassoulis 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Heyland-1998b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heyland 1998b</LINK>). In adult studies, however, there is a poor concordance between nutritional markers and clinical outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-Koretz-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Koretz 2005</LINK>). Although it seems intuitive that providing nutrition will be of benefit, because malnutrition is harmful, it does not necessarily follow that nutritional support during the first week of illness improves a critically ill patient's outcome.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Paediatric differences</HEADING>
<P>The American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition statements from 1997 and 2002 indicated that no randomized controlled trials of nutritional support in children with critical illness had been found (<LINK REF="REF-ASPEN-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">ASPEN 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Klein-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Klein 1997</LINK>). The nutritional needs of children with critical illness may be different from adults in many ways: in terms of underlying metabolism and growth, underlying illness and co-morbidities, pre-existing energy reserves (particularly in young infants), and responses to critical illness. It would be ideal to have studies specific to children to guide nutritional support in critically ill children. </P>
<P>For these reasons, a systematic review is needed to identify any randomized controlled trials of nutritional support during the first week of illness in critically ill children. Evidence is needed to provide clear guidelines for how and when to initiate feedings in children requiring intensive care. We did not include premature or low birth weight neonates as their care is in a neonatal intensive care unit and their needs are very likely to be different from infants and children during the first week of critical illness.<BR/>

<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS MODIFIED="2016-05-24 13:59:27 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>We planned to include trials of paediatric participants, aged one day to 18 years, who were cared for in a paediatric intensive care setting and who received nutrition within the first seven days of admission. We also planned to include studies involving both paediatric and adult participants if data were separately available for paediatric cases cared for in a paediatric intensive care unit (PICU). Studies were to be excluded if participants were primarily adults. We planned to analyse those participants aged less than one year separately from children who were older than one year, if such data were available, given that infants are believed to have higher nutritional requirements compared to older children. Furthermore, medical patients are often studied separately from surgical, critically ill participants (including trauma participants). If there were no studies that differentiated medical from surgical participants, we planned to group these participants in the analysis.</P>

<P>If a sufficient number of trials were included in the study, we planned to assess possible sources of heterogeneity for the primary outcome using either subgroup or sensitivity analyses, or both. We identified the following clinical subgroups: age (infants less than one year, children equal to or greater than one year old); and surgical patients (purpose of admission to PICU for postoperative care or care after trauma) versus medical patients (purpose of admission to PICU for medical illness without surgical intervention prior to admission). The subgroup for age was based on the fact that infants are at higher risk of catabolism and are generally fed more aggressively than older children. Infants may have less nutritional reserve than older children; a physiology that demonstrates rapid changes over the first year of life; and different admission diagnoses and co-morbidities to older children; accordingly they are typically managed differently from a clinical perspective. The subgroup of surgical versus medical patients was based on inherent differences between these populations and the precedence in the literature for examining these populations separately (<LINK REF="REF-Heyland-1998a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heyland 1998a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Heyland-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heyland 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Marik-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marik 2001</LINK>).

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2016-05-24 13:59:27 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>Nutritional support in children in the paediatric intensive care unit is considered important by most intensivists (<LINK REF="REF-van-der-Kuip-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">van der Kuip 2004</LINK>). Nevertheless, there are limited data on which to base optimal practice for nutritional support during the first week of critical illness in these children. Although it seems almost intuitively obvious that nutritional support early during critical illness would be of benefit, this has not been demonstrated in adults or children (<LINK REF="REF-Way-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Way 2007</LINK>). </P>
<P>There are reasons to question the dogma that nutritional support during the first week of critical illness is a priority. For example, metabolism and mitochondrial function are altered during critical illness (<LINK REF="REF-Fink-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fink 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mizock-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mizock 1984</LINK>); calorie restriction has been beneficial in animal models of critical illness (<LINK REF="REF-Alexander-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alexander 1989</LINK>), and possibly in adults with critical illness (<LINK REF="REF-Ash-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ash 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Krishnan-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Krishnan 2003</LINK>); overfeeding is associated with adverse effects (<LINK REF="REF-Chwals-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chwals 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zaloga-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zaloga 1994</LINK>); many trials in adults have given unclear evidence of benefit from early nutritional support in critical illness (<LINK REF="REF-Koretz-2007a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Koretz 2007a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Koretz-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Koretz 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Koretz-2007b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Koretz 2007b</LINK>); and surrogate nutritional outcomes may not be adequate to confirm a benefit from nutritional support in terms of meaningful clinical outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-Heyland-1998b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heyland 1998b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Koretz-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Koretz 2005</LINK>). Further, it has been found that in early critical illness children do not experience hypermetabolism (<LINK REF="REF-Framson-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Framson 2007</LINK>), and energy expenditure is close to or below calculated basal metabolic rate (<LINK REF="REF-Briassoulis-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Briassoulis 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jacsik-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jacsik 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Martinez-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Martinez 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Oosterveld-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oosterveld 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-White-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">White 2000</LINK>). Protein catabolism during this time cannot be averted by aggressive nutritional support, and anabolism with growth cannot be induced (<LINK REF="REF-Chwals-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chwals 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shew-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shew 1999</LINK>). </P>
<P>Therefore, we conducted this systematic review of the evidence for nutritional support during the first week of critical illness in children. With our exhaustive search strategy we found only one small, randomized controlled trial that met our criteria (<LINK REF="STD-Gottschlich-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Gottschlich 2002</LINK>). This trial evaluated early enteral feeding (that is, within 24 hours of injury) versus conventional feeding (that is, feeding withheld for at least 48 hours) among children with burns over 25% of their body surface area. The study found no differences between groups in clinically important outcomes including infection, length of stay, and mortality. We considered the quality of the evidence based on GRADE to be very low.</P>
<P>We found eight trials of an immune-enhancing formula versus a standard formula for feeding critically ill children, which did not show consistent benefit in terms of clinically important outcomes. This was, however, not a systematic review of immune-enhancing formulae in critically ill children. It would be of interest to conduct a systematic review of immune-enhancing formulae in paediatric critical illness. The immune-enhancing components may best be considered as pharmacological interventions, rather than nutritional support, in which case they should be studied separately from the need for nutritional support (<LINK REF="REF-Heyland-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heyland 2006</LINK>). One trial of gastric versus small bowel feeding found that more calories were provided in the small bowel-fed group, with trends toward increased mortality, ventilator days, intensive care unit days, and hospital days in the small bowel-fed group (<LINK REF="STD-Meert-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Meert 2004</LINK>). </P>
<P>Randomized controlled trials are needed to help guide optimal nutritional support of critically ill children during the first week of critical illness. We found little evidence to support or refute the suggested need for nutritional support in these children. While more research is needed, there are a number of challenges that researchers face in this area. These include the small number of children available for study, fewer funding opportunities for non-pharmacological nutritional interventions, and ethical concerns related to experimental protocols among this critically ill population. Further, methodological challenges exist, including the difficulty of blinding due to the nature of the intervention, heterogeneity of the patient population (comorbidities, admission diagnosis, age), and the large sample size required to show a change because of the low mortality rate in paediatric intensive care. Nevertheless, future multicentre trials are urgently needed. These must ensure methodological rigour by examining potential risks for bias at the design stage (for example, in blinding outcome assessors or using objective outcomes, such as organ dysfunction scores, that are less prone to biased assessments or reporting). Our search update found a protocol for an international, multicenter randomized controlled trial comparing "early versus late initiation of parenteral nutrition when enteral nutrition fails to reach preset caloric targets in critically ill children" (<LINK REF="STD-Fivez-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Fivez 2015</LINK>). No results are yet available; these will be added to future updates of this review.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2016-05-07 22:20:01 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Research is needed to guide nutritional support in critically ill children (excluding premature or low birth weight neonates). We suggest that randomized trials of nutritional support in critically ill children during the first week of critical illness should include a control arm in which no nutritional support is administered or hypocaloric goals (below basal metabolic rate) for nutritional support are used. One multi-center, international randomized controlled trial is ongoing.</P>
