<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2011-11-21 09:37:11 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Adequate gas exchange is readily accomplished in full term infants with appropriately developed lungs. In contrast, premature infants with respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) or bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) often require medical support to achieve gas exchange. Conventional mechanical ventilation (CMV) is a common therapy used to accomplish this.</P>
<P>CMV allows for oxygenated air to be driven into an infant's lungs from a ventilator through a tube that is placed inside the infant's trachea. The gas exchange is facilitated by a set of pressures applied during a respiratory cycle supported or maintained by the ventilator. One of these pressures is known as positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) and can be thought of as a continuous pressure that is applied throughout the respiratory cycle. It plays an important role in keeping the lungs open and preventing collapse so that all areas of the lungs can participate in gas exchange.</P>
<P>While it is generally accepted that some level of PEEP is important and necessary to accomplish adequate gas exchange, it is not clear what level of PEEP results in the greatest benefit. While too little PEEP likely fails to provide adequate gas exchange, too much PEEP may lead to over distension of the lungs resulting in harm.</P>
<P>This review was performed to assess what the best level of PEEP is for preterm infants requiring CMV for either RDS or BPD. It also searched for evidence of any strategies that have been effective in determining the best level of PEEP for infants on an individual case by case basis.</P>
<P>The results of this review highlight that there has been very little good quality research in the form of randomized controlled trials assessing the effects of different PEEP levels. Only a single study, performed in infants receiving CMV for RDS, met our criteria for inclusion. This study was small and the results were not sufficient to lead to any recommendations on the best PEEP level for infants with RDS. No study met the inclusion criteria for the review for either BPD or for strategies attempting to identify an individualized PEEP level. This review draws attention to the need for more randomized controlled trials addressing these unanswered questions.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2011-11-30 12:13:23 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]" NOTES="&lt;p&gt;For text regarding influence of different parameters on PEEP and on each other: this seems awkward. We state these facts, but then move away from the subject without further addressing it or offering an approach for taking this into account in the review. I have made reference to some of these ideas in the discussion section.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Per Model Neonatal Review, text was added justifying the a priori subgroup analyses. This may need to be backed up with some references. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SS: The last sentence in the paragraph beginning with &amp;quot;Ultimately what the best...&amp;quot;: could be changed for a broader statement such as: &amp;quot;We wish to determine if such an &amp;quot;optimum&amp;quot; PEEP level can be defined for individual infants on conventional mechanical ventilation and if there are effective methods of individualizing PEEP therapy for improved outcomes.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;" NOTES_MODIFIED="2011-11-30 12:13:23 -0500" NOTES_MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Conventional mechanical ventilation (CMV) of neonates has been used as a treatment of respiratory failure for 30 years, and the technology has developed dramatically in this time. However, the basis of CMV remains unchanged: humidified, heated, oxygenated gas is driven into the infant's lungs for a set period of time (inspiratory time or Ti) at a given pressure (peak inspiratory pressure or PIP), followed by an expiratory phase of set duration (expiratory time or Te) where positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) is maintained. This cycle is repeated a number of times per minute, giving a respiratory rate or frequency.</P>
<P>The understanding that while mechanical ventilation facilitates gaseous exchange it may simultaneously damage the lung (volu-baro-trauma) (<LINK REF="REF-Michna-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Michna 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tremblay-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tremblay 2002</LINK>) has become widely accepted. Most attention has focused on the potentially damaging effects of PIP. The need to consider other parameters in examining this balance was highlighted by the concept of a 'mean airways pressure' by Boros in 1979 (<LINK REF="REF-Boros-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boros 1979</LINK>). This value encapsulated various parameters of ventilation such as PIP and PEEP into a single pressure value. While convenient, it hindered the study of the potentially important contributions of each component part. Although acknowledged, the contribution of the level of PEEP on this balance has not been well studied in the neonatal literature (<LINK REF="REF-Monkman-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Monkman 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>The risks and benefits of PEEP should be considered when setting this pressure parameter. The beneficial effects of PEEP may be related to an increase in functional residual capacity, alveolar recruitment, reduced work of breathing, or an improvement in the distribution of ventilation to perfusion (<LINK REF="REF-Gregory-1971" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gregory 1971</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Richardson-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Richardson 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Richardson-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Richardson 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Thome-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thome 1998</LINK>). Both <LINK REF="REF-Corbridge-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Corbridge 1990</LINK> and <LINK REF="REF-Froese-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Froese 1993</LINK> demonstrated in animal models that zero end expiratory pressure (ZEEP), or near-ZEEP, is deleterious. However, concerns have been raised about the potential risks of inappropriately high PEEP, specifically air leak syndromes, gas trapping, and deleterious effects on cardiac function (<LINK REF="REF-Reynolds-1971" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reynolds 1971</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Simbruner-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Simbruner 1986</LINK>; Hausdorf 1987). Impaired venous return is generally considered the main cause of depressed cardiac function with the application of PEEP.</P>
<P>Adjusting the level of PEEP is important in neonates requiring CMV. If the level of PEEP is too low, alveolar collapse leads to impaired gaseous exchange and a probable increase in lung damage. Higher PEEP levels appear to reduce lung damage in a rabbit model of neonatal respiratory distress syndrome (<LINK REF="REF-Sandhar-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sandhar 1988</LINK>). Alternatively, PEEP levels set too high may decrease tidal and minute ventilation, impair expiration, decrease cardiac output, and cause lung damage though over-distension leading to pulmonary interstitial emphysema, pneumothorax, and other types of air leaks syndromes.</P>
<P>In the ventilation of adults with adult respiratory distress syndrome, the concept of a 'best' PEEP that trades off these competing factors has been recognized (<LINK REF="REF-Amato-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Amato 1998</LINK>). Randomized clinical trials comparing different levels of PEEP have been performed (<LINK REF="REF-Brower-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brower 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Meade-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meade 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mercat-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mercat 2008</LINK>) and a systematic review comparing different PEEP levels on patient important outcomes has recently been reported (<LINK REF="REF-Briel-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Briel 2010</LINK>). In contrast, this question has not been well addressed in neonates requiring CMV for RDS or BPD.</P>
<P>In this review, we will consider PEEP levels of &lt; 5 cm H<SUB>2</SUB>O to comprise 'low' PEEP, and <U>&gt;</U> 5cm H<SUB>2</SUB>0 to comprise 'high' PEEP. The reason for the cut-off at 5 cm H<SUB>2</SUB>O, although arbitrary, reflects a common value applied in many neonatal units. Additionally, da Silva 1994 (<LINK REF="REF-da-Silva-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">da Silva 1994</LINK>) demonstrated potentially useful increases in functional residual capacity (FRC) from pressure of 2 to 5 cm H<SUB>2</SUB>O; and at 5 cm H<SUB>2</SUB>O the mean values for FRC were similar to the normal values of healthy term infants.</P>
<P>It is plausible that the appropriate level of PEEP for neonates depends on factors influencing the underlying pathophysiology on a case by case basis. For example, changes in pulmonary physiology secondary to differences in gestational age or prior treatments, such as exogenous surfactant therapy, may influence the impact of different PEEP levels.</P>
<P>It is possible then that rather than a single value of PEEP for all infants, an individualized level is more appropriate. In fact, in some of the earliest applications of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy, Bonta (<LINK REF="REF-Bonta-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bonta 1977</LINK>) suggested that it was possible to determine an 'optimum' individual pressure for CPAP in an infant with respiratory distress syndrome (RDS). In that study 'optimum' was defined as that level of PEEP at which the maximum reduction in required oxygen was achieved. In an early attempt at individualization, Mathe and colleagues proposed examining characteristics of individual pressure-volume curves to identify the lower inflexion point of the inspiratory limb as the point of 'appropriate PEEP' (<LINK REF="REF-Mathe-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mathe 1987</LINK>). Controlled trials in newborn animal models suggest that setting PEEP levels above this level may provide an individualized technique to minimize lung damage (<LINK REF="REF-Monkman-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Monkman 2001</LINK>). We wish to determine if there are effective methods of individualizing PEEP therapy during conventional mechanical ventilation and to determine which of these methods are associated with improved outcomes.</P>
<P>In summary, in this review we examine the following questions. For infants requiring CMV for RDS or BPD, what should be recommended as the clinical standard; high or low PEEP? Furthermore, are there methods of determining an appropriate individualized PEEP strategy for infants requiring CMV for RDS?</P>

<P>A single study (<LINK REF="STD-Aufricht-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Aufricht 1995</LINK>) met the inclusion criteria following detailed review.</P>
<P>This three period cross-over study randomized 13 infants from a single center in Vienna, Austria who were on CMV for RDS to three different PEEP levels. Mean gestational age and range were provided for the study participants as a whole but not for individual patients or by group in the initial randomization. Weight and age in days were reported for each individual participant. The patients were initially randomized to CMV with a PEEP of either 2, 4 or 6 cm H<SUB>2</SUB>O. Following the initial period, they were switched to the two remaining levels as determined by a random sequence that corresponded to each infant. The infant remained at each level for 30 minutes prior to being crossed-over to the next period. While on CMV, peak pressures were simultaneously altered to keep the inflation pressures constant. Other respiratory settings were not changed. Patients did not all receive the same sedation and ventilation techniques. Outcomes were measured at the end of each 30 minute period. These outcomes included two of our pre-specified secondary outcomes of interest, PaCO<SUB>2</SUB> and AaDO<SUB>2</SUB>. The results of the measured outcomes were detailed for each infant after each cross-over period, allowing isolation of data after the first cross-over period.</P>
<P>Infants were randomized to a PEEP of 2 cm H<SUB>2</SUB>O (n = 4), 4 cm H<SUB>2</SUB>O (n = 6), or 6 cm H<SUB>2</SUB>O (n = 3). As defined for the review, low PEEP is &lt; 5 cm H<SUB>2</SUB>O while high PEEP is &#8805; 5 cm H<SUB>2</SUB>O. As such, the first two groups were collapsed, resulting in low PEEP (n = 10) versus high PEEP (n = 3). Lastly, a single infant from the group initially randomized to 2 cm H<SUB>2</SUB>O received deliberate hyperventilation to a pre-specified PaCO<SUB>2</SUB> range as part of the ventilatory management. This infant was excluded from the analysis, resulting in measurements comparing patients undergoing low PEEP (n = 9) versus high PEEP (n = 3).</P>
<P>The study authors did not address the unequal distribution to the three treatment groups in the initial randomization. Because the original study employed a cross-over design ensuring an equal number of study periods for each treatment group at the conclusion of the study, it is possible that the study authors were less concerned about the uneven initial chance randomization.</P>

<P>A single study (<LINK REF="STD-Aufricht-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Aufricht 1995</LINK>) met the inclusion criteria. In this study, patients were allocated to an initial PEEP level by a random sequence table. Further details on the methods for generating or obtaining this table were not provided. Blinding of personnel to the allocated intervention during the study or at the time of outcome assessment was not addressed but was unlikely given the study design. Data for all 13 patients were reported for each measured outcome and the study was free of suggestion of selective reporting.

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Summary of main results</HEADING>
<P>The principal result of this study was the finding of lack of evidence with respect to the review's aims, which were listed previously under <LINK TAG="OBJECTIVES" TYPE="SECTION">Objectives</LINK>.</P>
<P>Multiple outcomes for comparisons were identified a priori to evaluate these objectives and are listed in <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>. Ultimately, not a single eligible study addressing Objectives 2 or 3 was identified. For Objective 1, a single study meeting the eligibility criteria was identified (<LINK REF="STD-Aufricht-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Aufricht 1995</LINK>). While this study provided data for two of our pre-specified secondary outcomes of interest (PaCO<SUB>2</SUB> and AaDO<SUB>2</SUB>), it did not provide any data for patient important outcomes such as our primary outcomes of mortality and neurodevelopment. For the two studied outcomes, PaCO<SUB>2</SUB> and AaDO<SUB>2</SUB>, the trial did not find a significant difference between low PEEP and high PEEP.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Overall completeness and applicability of evidence</HEADING>
<P>The findings of this review are insufficient to substantially address any of the objectives of this study. The results are limited to the effects of high versus low PEEP for infants undergoing CMV for RDS on PaCO<SUB>2</SUB> and AaDO<SUB>2</SUB> levels, and the study does not find a significant difference between different PEEP levels for these outcomes. The infants were not treated with surfactant despite evidence of RDS, deviating from current standard practice.</P>
<P>The findings of this review are limited to data from 12 patients in a single study from a center in Vienna, Austria (<LINK REF="STD-Aufricht-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Aufricht 1995</LINK>). This study is clearly underpowered to detect any important clinical differences at a statistically significant level. While the effect sizes of the interventions on the reported outcomes suggest a possible clinically important difference between low and high PEEP, the paucity of existing data is such that the effect size could vary considerably with the inclusion of additional data. The effect size on the existing outcomes provides an unreliable estimate of the true effect of the intervention and is a limitation of this current review.</P>
<P>As such, the results of this review can not provide evidence to guide current clinical practice for any of the three objectives. This underscores the need for well designed randomized trials evaluating the impact of different PEEP levels on patient outcomes in infants undergoing CMV for RDS or BPD.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Quality of the evidence</HEADING>
<P>The findings of this review are limited to data from a single study (<LINK REF="STD-Aufricht-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Aufricht 1995</LINK>). The results are limited to the effects of high versus low PEEP for infants undergoing CMV for RDS on PaCO<SUB>2</SUB> and AaDO<SUB>2</SUB>, and do not find a significant difference between the groups for these outcomes.</P>
<P>While blinding of the intervention and outcomes are not addressed in the study, the allocation of participants to different PEEP levels via random tables and the complete and transparent nature of the study results are strengths that support the internal validity of these results. A key shortcoming of this study is the inconsistency in the sedation and ventilation techniques applied between study participants. While some patients were sedated with chloral hydrate, paralyzed with pancuronium, and ventilated with controlled ventilation (N = 5), others received no sedation while spontaneously breathing on intermittent mandatory ventilation (IMV) (n = 7). While the groups were combined when reporting the measured outcome, it is possible that these different techniques had a confounding effect on the results. These methodological shortcomings detract from the internal validity of this study. An additional limitation was the short study period (30 minutes). It is possible that there was inadequate time to achieve stabilization at the randomized PEEP levels, and that the effects of these interventions would differ if measured following a longer intervention time. </P>
<P>One infant from the study was excluded for the purpose of our analyses. This infant was sedated with chloral hydrate and hyperventilated to a PaCO<SUB>2</SUB> less than 35 mmHg with controlled ventilation. This ventilation technique disallowed the use of PaCO<SUB>2</SUB> and AaDO<SUB>2</SUB> as outcome measures for this infant.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Potential biases in the review process</HEADING>
<P>This review is limited by several potential sources of bias.</P>
<P>The electronic search strategy, found in <LINK REF="APP-01" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 1</LINK>, was created a priori and with a deliberate effort to maximize the sensitivity of the strategy for identifying relevant trials. However, it must be noted that of the 10 studies ultimately considered for inclusion, only six resulted from the original electronic search. Of the four remaining articles, three were known and provided by one of our senior authors. The remaining article was identified through a search of the reference section of one of the articles being considered for inclusion. This suggests that our search strategy, despite providing nearly 900 articles for assessment, potentially lacked the sensitivity to identify all relevant articles. An assessment revealed that the missing of these articles may have arisen from inappropriate keyword and filter classifications on the part of the electronic databases used to identify studies in this review.</P>
<P>For the purpose of this review, we created a dichotomy by defining low PEEP as &lt; 5 cm H<SUB>2</SUB>O and high PEEP as &#8805; 5 cm H<SUB>2</SUB>O. Although there are some small animal data (<LINK REF="REF-da-Silva-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">da Silva 1994</LINK>) to suggest 5 cm H<SUB>2</SUB>O as an appropriate cut-off value, this separation is somewhat arbitrary. Our single included study (<LINK REF="STD-Aufricht-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Aufricht 1995</LINK>) randomized patients to PEEP levels of 2, 4 and 6 cm H<SUB>2</SUB>O. As specified in our a priori methodology, the outcomes of the infants in the 2 and 4 cm H<SUB>2</SUB>O groups were combined into the low PEEP group and compared to the high PEEP group, composed of those infants randomized to 6 cm H<SUB>2</SUB>O. As the difference in the intervention between infants assigned to 2 cm H<SUB>2</SUB>O versus 4 cm H<SUB>2</SUB>O and between infants assigned to 4 cm H<SUB>2</SUB>O versus 6 cm H<SUB>2</SUB>O is quantitatively identical, the limitations of our arbitrary dichotomy is highlighted when applied to this trial.</P>
<P>A major barrier to the inclusion of studies in this review was the limitations of data from cross-over studies. Generally, the effects of interventions in any preceding cross-over period may influence the measured outcomes in subsequent cross-over periods. Studies involving mechanical ventilation are complicated by the possible recruitment and de-recruitment of preceding ventilation parameters. This was a concerning limitation in the context of our review objectives. As such, we determined to limit outcome data to those resulting from the first cross-over period. Several of the identified studies (<LINK REF="STD-Aufricht-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Aufricht 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dimitriou-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Dimitriou 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dinger-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Dinger 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Herman-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Herman 1973</LINK>) employed a cross-over design in assessing the impact of different levels of PEEP in infants on CMV for RDS. These studies had short time intervals for each cross-over period, raising the concern that interventions following the initial randomization may not have had adequate time to achieve stabilization before the outcomes were measured. Of these studies, only <LINK REF="STD-Aufricht-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Aufricht 1995</LINK> presented their outcome results in such a way that individual data from the first cross-over period could be isolated. Correspondence with Dr Dimitriou confirmed that data of this nature were not available for his study. It is our understanding that nearly 40 years after the completion of the study, the likelihood of retrieving the necessary information for <LINK REF="STD-Herman-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Herman 1973</LINK> is sufficiently low to merit exclusion. To date, we have been unable to establish effective correspondence with the authors of <LINK REF="STD-Dinger-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Dinger 1999</LINK>. While we have had to exclude such articles from the analysis at present, this criterion may have limited the inclusion of relevant data in this review.</P>
<P>As implied by the third objective of this review, the optimal level of PEEP may only be achieved by individualization of PEEP therapy. Of interest, <LINK REF="STD-Aufricht-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Aufricht 1995</LINK> attempted to establish criteria for an individualized approach. In short, the study set out to show that the alveolar distension index (a measure of relative pulmonary over or under-distension, derived from characteristics of volume-pressure curves) may be helpful in predicting the effect of PEEP changes in ventilated infants on a case-by-case basis. However, the authors did not perform a randomized evaluation of this strategy. This idea of individualized PEEP finds support in studies dating back over 30 years. In some of the earliest applications of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy, Bonta (<LINK REF="REF-Bonta-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bonta 1977</LINK>) argued that it was possible to determine an 'optimum' individual pressure for CPAP in infants with respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) by monitoring transmitted esophageal pressures and gradually increasing airway pressures until a maximum reduction in required oxygen was achieved. A similar approach was used several years later by Tanswell and colleagues (<LINK REF="REF-Tanswell-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tanswell 1980</LINK>), who identified an 'appropriate' nasal continuous distending pressure as the one at which transpulmonary transmission of airway pressure to the esophagus suddenly increased, associating this level with decreases in oxygen requirements. The study methodology of <LINK REF="STD-Aufricht-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Aufricht 1995</LINK> bears resemblance to the work conducted by Mathe and colleagues (<LINK REF="REF-Mathe-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mathe 1987</LINK>), in which inspiratory pressure-volume curves were used to determine an individualized PEEP level for newborn infants with RDS. These studies all suggest that considering baseline differences between infants may be critical to the determination of an appropriate PEEP level and that these differences should be considered when evaluating potential heterogeneity within and between studies.</P>

<P>The findings of this review should raise awareness of the lack of evidence guiding the selection of PEEP levels in preterm infants undergoing CMV for RDS or BPD.</P>
<P>Trials addressing the study objectives are warranted. This includes trials evaluating the effects of different levels of PEEP in infants undergoing CMV for both RDS and BPD. Trials comparing the effect of different strategies for determining an 'optimal', individualized PEEP level based on available patient data and characteristics are also warranted.</P>
<P>Trials evaluating the effects of these interventions should examine outcomes that are important to the patient, such as mortality and neurodevelopmental outcomes, and be aware of the limitations resulting from cross-over trials. In instances in which cross-over trials are performed, researchers should be mindful of the importance of presenting data in such a way that data can be isolated following the end of each cross-over period.</P>

<BR/>Controlled vocabulary (MeSH) terms were searched as both keywords and subject headings, this is indicated by the "'Term X'.mp. or exp Term X/" format seen below. Text words were searched as keywords, as indicated by the "Term X".mp format seen below.<BR/>
<BR/>The search was limited by application of a filter for randomized clinical trials, as seen in item #24.<BR/>
<BR/>The search was applied to both the standard database as well as to "In-Process &amp; Other Non-Indexed Citations." The search included studies in these databases through November 2010.<BR/>

<BR/>III. Ovid EMBASE<BR/>
<BR/>Notes:<BR/>
<BR/>Controlled vocabulary was examined and used by mapping terms to EMTREE terminology. Additonally, each term was searched as both "map to preferred terminology" and "search also for synonyms, explosion on preferred terminology". This was found to be the most sensitive search strategy.<BR/>
<BR/>It was noted that including multiple-word term with or without quotation resulted in a different number or search results. Furthermore, it was noted that neither including or excluding quotation marks consistently resulted in an more sensitive search result, with some terms having a greater return of results with quotations while others had a greater return of results without quotations. As such, each term was searched both with and without quotations. Ultimately these results were combined. This technique is reflected throughout the search strategy below. Terms searched without quotations were displayed with an "AND" between words.<BR/>
<BR/>The search was limited by application of a filter for randomized clinical trials, as seen in item #24.<BR/>
