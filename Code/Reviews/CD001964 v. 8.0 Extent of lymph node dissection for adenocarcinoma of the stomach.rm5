<P>
<B>Review question</B>
</P>
<P>Does more extended lymphadenectomy lead to a survival advantage for patients undergoing surgery for gastric carcinoma?</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>Gastric carcinoma is a leading cause of cancer death worldwide. For patients affected with this disease, the main therapy is surgery, which consists of gastric resection along with the removal of lymph nodes surrounding the stomach (a procedure called lymphadenectomy). Three types of progressively more extended lymphadenectomies exist (called D1, D2 and D3); their therapeutic benefit is debated.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>We collected data from eight randomized controlled trials addressing this issue and enrolling a total of 2515 patients.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>We found that D2 lymphadenectomy can reduce the number of deaths due to disease progression as compared to D1 lymphadenectomy. However, D2 lymphadenectomy was also associated with a higher rate of postoperative mortality. In addition, available evidence does not support the superiority of D3 versus D2 lymphadenectomy. In conclusion, our findings support the use of D2 lymphadenectomy in patients with resectable carcinoma of the stomach, although the increased incidence of postoperative mortality reduces its therapeutic effect.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
</P>
<P>The quality of the evidence was moderate due to an intermediate level of result heterogeneity across the included trials.</P>

<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2015-04-25 08:05:03 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We aimed to systematically review and meta-analyze the evidence on the impact of the three main types of progressively more extended lymph node dissection (that is, D1, D2 and D3 lymphadenectomy) on the clinical outcome of patients with primary resectable carcinoma of the stomach. The primary objective was to assess the impact of lymphadenectomy extent on survival (overall survival [OS], disease specific survival [DSS] and disease free survival [DFS]). The secondary aim was to assess the impact of lymphadenectomy on post-operative mortality.</P>

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2015-06-05 11:36:56 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE and EMBASE until 2001, including references from relevant articles and conference proceedings. We also contacted known researchers in the field. For the updated review, CENTRAL, MEDLINE and EMBASE were searched from 2001 to February 2015.</P>

<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2015-04-29 15:54:34 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We considered randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the three main types of lymph node dissection (i.e., D1, D2 and D3 lymphadenectomy) in patients with primary non-metastatic resectable carcinoma of the stomach.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2015-06-02 20:57:33 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two authors independently extracted data from the included studies. Hazard ratios (HR) and relative risks (RR) along with their 95% confidence intervals (CI) were used to measure differences in survival and mortality rates between trial arms, respectively. Potential sources of between-study heterogeneity were investigated by means of subgroup and sensitivity analyses. The same two authors independently assessed the risk of bias of eligible studies according to the standards of the Cochrane Collaboration and the quality of the overall evidence based on the GRADE (Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation) criteria.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-06-04 11:30:28 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Eight RCTs (enrolling 2515 patients) met the inclusion criteria. Three RCTs (all performed in Asian countries) compared D3 with D2 lymphadenectomy: data suggested no significant difference in OS between these two types of lymph node dissection (HR 0.99, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.21), with no significant difference in postoperative mortality (RR 1.67, 95% CI 0.41 to 6.73). Data for DFS were available only from one trial and for no trial were DSS data available. Five RCTs (n = 3 European; n = 2 Asian) compared D2 to D1 lymphadenectomy: OS (n = 5; HR 0.91, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.17) and DFS (n=3; HR 0.95, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.07) findings suggested no significant difference between these two types of lymph node dissection. In contrast, D2 lymphadenectomy was associated with a significantly better DSS compared to D1 lymphadenectomy (HR 0.81, 95% CI 0.71 to 0.92), the quality of the body of evidence being moderate; however, D2 lymphadenectomy was also associated with a higher postoperative mortality rate (RR 2.02, 95% CI 1.34 to 3.04).</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2015-06-02 21:02:01 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Gastric carcinoma ranks fifth among the most common cancers and third among the most frequent causes of cancer death worldwide (<LINK REF="REF-Ferlay-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ferlay 2014</LINK>). Surgery remains the only intervention known to produce cure or long-term survival when used alone (<LINK REF="REF-Hartgrink-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hartgrink 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Blum-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blum 2013</LINK>). The prognosis after macroscopically (R1) and microscopically (R0) complete resection is strongly related to penetration of the primary tumor through the stomach wall (T-stage) and lymph node involvement (N-stage). Reported five-year survival rates range from over 90% in intramucosal cancer to about 20% in patients with lymph node metastatic disease. In view of the poor survival rates for more advanced disease, additional treatment options (i.e., adjuvant or postoperative chemotherapy) are recommended for patients at high risk of disease recurrence and death, such as those with lymph node metastasis (<LINK REF="REF-Hartgrink-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hartgrink 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Blum-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blum 2013</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2015-06-04 11:39:16 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The role of surgery is not only to remove the primary tumor but also the locoregional lymph nodes (i.e., the lymph nodes that drain the lymph of the affected organ), as these may contain metastatic deposits. A limited dissection removes only the nodal groups strictly adjacent to the stomach (so called D1 lymph node dissection), whereas more extended operations also remove the nodes along the three branches (i.e., the left gastric artery, the splenic artery and the hepatic artery) of the coeliac axis (so called D2 lymphadenectomy). When even more distant lymph nodes are removed (i.e., para-aortic lymph nodes) the lymph node dissection is named D3 lymphadenectomy. The value of surgical dissection to remove the draining lymph nodes has been controversial for decades (<LINK REF="REF-Akagi-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Akagi 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Allum-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Allum 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Blum-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blum 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Giuliani-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Giuliani 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hartgrink-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hartgrink 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Saka-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Saka 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Steur-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Steur 2013</LINK>). Japanese surgeons routinely perform the more extended (i.e., D2 or D3) as opposed to the more limited (D1) lymph node dissection, reasoning that the tumor is known to disseminate outwards in an orderly fashion through lymphatic channels from the stomach (<LINK REF="REF-Soga-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Soga 1979</LINK>). Therefore, more extended lymph node dissection should theoretically provide patients with a better chance of survival via two distinct mechanisms. First, removal of more lymph nodes should guarantee a more accurate disease staging (N-stage; <LINK REF="REF-Arigami-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Arigami 2013</LINK>), which can indirectly improve survival by identifying patients with high risk of disease recurrence who can benefit most from adjuvant therapy. Second, more extended lymphadenectomy should increase the likelihood of removing microscopic metastatic deposits that are responsible for disease relapse (<LINK REF="REF-Arigami-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Arigami 2013</LINK>). In this regard, some non-randomized studies have reported promising survival findings for D2 as compared to D1 surgery (<LINK REF="STD-Onate_x002d_Ocana-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Onate-Ocana 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Viste-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Viste 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Volpe-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Volpe 2000</LINK>). However, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the three types of lymph node dissection (i.e., D1, D2 and D3) have shown no definitive difference in terms of survival (<LINK REF="REF-Steur-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Steur 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Giuliani-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Giuliani 2014</LINK>). In fact, most studies provide consistent evidence of increased postoperative morbidity and mortality for more extended lymph node dissection (<LINK REF="REF-Allum-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Allum 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Giuliani-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Giuliani 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Steur-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Steur 2013</LINK>).</P>

<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2015-06-02 01:49:45 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Available evidence does not univocally support the routine implementation of more extended lymphadenectomy in patients with gastric cancer, since the survival advantage is unclear. Moreover, it is widely acknowledged that more aggressive surgery is followed by higher rates of postoperative complications. As a consequence, international guidelines addressing the best surgical approach to lymph node dissection in gastric cancer patients are more opinion-based than evidence-based (<LINK REF="REF-Verlato-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Verlato 2014</LINK>). In addition, no meta-analysis performed so far has comprehensively addressed the issue of survival (i.e. time-to-event) data. Therefore, we tried to fill this gap of the medical literature.</P>

<P>In order to assess the adequacy of the overall sample size (i.e., across the pooled trials) in terms of survival, we considered that at least 1380 patients should be enrolled to detect a minimum therapeutic benefit of interest (HR equal to or lower than 0.80) with a sufficient statistical power (80%), setting the alpha level of significance at 5% and considering an average five-year survival rate in the control population (patients undergoing D1 lymphadenectomy) equal to 50%, as calculated by using the Stata 11.2 SE statistical software (<LINK REF="REF-StataCorp-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">StataCorp 2015</LINK>). In order to assess the adequacy of the overall sample size (i.e., across the pooled trials) in terms of postoperative mortality, we considered that at least 1200 patients should be enrolled to detect a minimum harm of interest (RR equal to or higher than 2) with a sufficient statistical power (80%), setting the alpha level of significance at 5% and considering an average postoperative mortality rate in the control population (patients undergoing D1 lymphadenectomy) equal to 4%. Sample size considerations were also applied to assess the quality of the body of evidence.

In cases of high heterogeneity, we interpreted the summary effect with caution. The Cochran's Q test was adopted to formally test the hypothesis that heterogeneity was different from null (although the amount of heterogeneity - as measured by the I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic - is believed to be more informative than the demonstration of its occurrence). To be more conservative, we considered that heterogeneity was present when the Cochran's Q test P value was lower than 0.1.</P>

<P>Statistical analysis was carried out using RevMan version 5.2 (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2008</LINK>). For time-to-event data, pooled hazard ratios (HRs) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were utilized to provide summary estimates of the relative therapeutic effect of different types of lymphadenectomy. For dichotomous data, pooled risk ratios (RRs) and corresponding 95% CIs were utilized to compare mortality rates associated with different types of lymphadenectomy. Summary estimates were calculated using the fixed-effect model; however, in cases of high between-study heterogeneity, the random-effects model was adopted.

<P>In order to provide readers with information on the absolute effect of treatment on patient outcomes, the number needed to treat (NNT; the number of patients needed to be treated in order to avoid one event of interest) was calculated for the survival endpoint (<LINK REF="REF-Altman-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Altman 1999</LINK>) and the number needed to harm (NNH; the number of patients needed to be treated in order to cause an adverse event of interest) for the postoperative mortality endpoint.</P>
<P>Finally, the Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system was employed to grade the quality of evidence into four levels: high quality, moderate quality, low quality and very low quality (<LINK REF="REF-Guyatt-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guyatt 2011</LINK>). According to this system, the quality can be downgraded by one level (serious concern) or two levels (very serious concern) for the following reasons: risk of bias (see above section), inconsistency (unexplained heterogeneity, inconsistency of results), indirectness (indirect population, intervention, control, outcomes) and imprecision (wide confidence intervals). The quality can also be upgraded by one level if a large summary effect is found (we chose HR &lt; 0.8) or if a linear relationship between extent of lymphadenectomy and survival improvement is observed.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-06-04 11:32:00 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>By analyzing the data from eight RCTs enrolling 2515 patients, we found that D3 lymphadenectomy is not associated with a survival advantage as compared to D2 lymphadenectomy in patients with resectable primary carcinoma of the stomach. In contrast, a significant survival benefit was demonstrated for D2 type lymph node dissection as compared to D1 lymphadenectomy; however, this advantage was limited to DSS (HR 0.81, 95% CI 0.71 to 0.92). D2 lymphadenectomy was also associated with a significantly increased risk of postoperative mortality, which ultimately reduces the therapeutic benefit. As a rough measure of the balance between benefit and harm associated with D2 lymphadenectomy (as compared to D1 type lymph node dissection), we can consider the difference between deaths avoided (71/1000) and those caused (38/1000) by the more extended lymph node dissection, which would lead to a net benefit equal to 33 deaths avoided for every 1000 patients treated with D2 lymphadenectomy.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2015-06-02 15:15:07 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The included trials directly addressed the review question (i.e. whether the extent of lymphadenectomy affects patients survival), however, some limitations of the available evidence must be noted.</P>
<P>First, not all RCTs reported on all possible survival outcomes (OS, DSS and DFS), as detailed in the <LINK TAG="RESULTS" TYPE="SECTION">Results</LINK> section. This was particularly true for the D3 versus D2 lymphadenectomy trials, from which only OS data could be meta-analyzed. Regarding D2 versus D1 type of lymph node dissection, the lack of complete survival data prevented us from using all trials for all primary outcomes, which ultimately reduced the power for detecting relevant survival differences.</P>
<P>Second, in some trials patients were not allowed to receive either neoadjuvant (i.e., pre-operative) or adjuvant (i.e., post-operative) medical therapies (e.g., systemic chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy), and in others no data were reported on this subject. In light of the wide use of these complementary treatments in the current management of patients with gastric cancer, this is probably an important obstacle in interpreting the relevance of the present findings in terms of applicability to the "real world". In particular, it remains unclear whether the survival advantage associated with a more extended lymphadenectomy can be synergically combined with that of adjuvant/neoadjuvant treatments or whether they obviate each other (i.e., chemotherapy might make more extended lymph node dissection gratuitous, and vice versa). In this regard, trials designed to answer this question are eagerly awaited.</P>
<P>Third, the expertise of the surgeons performing lymphadenectomy in patients with gastric cancer is rarely reported, although it is deemed to represent an important determinant in patient clinical outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-Cuschieri-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cuschieri 2014</LINK>). Therefore, findings might be different from trials performed in highly specialized centers (with high caseloads).</P>
<P>Finally, the lack of evidence for the superiority of D3 vs D2 lymphadenectomy was based exclusively on Asian patients, which leaves undressed the issue of whether or not D3 lymphadenectomy is beneficial in Caucasian patients.</P>

<P>The randomized controlled trials (RCTs) included in this review and meta-analysis were overall of high quality. There was a serious concern of bias due to small sample size (insufficient to achieve adequate statistical power given a clinically meaningful survival difference between the two study arms) and lack of information describing the methodology in only one RCT (<LINK REF="STD-Maeta-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Maeta 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>According to the GRADE criteria, the body of evidence for each review endpoint was as follows (see <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>; <LINK REF="SOF-02" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 2</LINK>):</P>
<P>1) <B>OS</B>: the lack of superiority of D3 versus D2 lymphadenectomy was supported by a <B>moderate</B> <B>quality</B> body of evidence. Downgrading was due to the fact that only 862 patients were enrolled in three RCTs, whereas at least 1380 patients should be enrolled to detect a minimum therapeutic benefit of interest (HR equal to or lower than 0.80). In addition, no data on other survival endpoints (i.e., disease specific and disease free survival) were available.</P>
<P>2) <B>OS</B>: the lack of superiority of D2 versus D1 lymphadenectomy was supported by a <B>low quality</B> body of evidence (the downgrading was due to high between-study heterogeneity as well as to the contrasting evidence on disease specific survival, which was higher for patients undergoing D2 lymphadenectomy).</P>
<P>3) <B>DSS</B>: the superiority of D2 versus D1 lymphadenectomy was supported by a <B>moderate quality</B> body of evidence (the downgrading was due to intermediate between-study heterogeneity as well as to the contrasting evidence on overall and disease free survival, which was not higher for patients undergoing D2 lymphadenectomy).</P>

<P>5) <B>Postoperative mortality</B>: the lack of difference between D3 and D2 lymphadenectomy was supported by a <B>moderate quality</B> body of evidence.

<P>The thorough literature search should have identified all relevant trials. However, the possibility always exists that RCTs have been carried out but remain unreported or reported either in meeting abstracts or in articles published in journals not indexed in the databases we screened. These may be factors within, or outside, the control of the review authors.</P>
<P>As regards data availability, only an international collaboration leading to the sharing of original data and allowing an individual patient data meta-analysis might overcome the lack of data regarding DSS and DFS in some trials. Moreover, hazard ratios utilized for meta-analysis were not always adjusted by well established confounding factors (e.g., disease stage), as is the case for hazard ratios extrapolated from Kaplan-Meier survival curves. Once again, only an individual patient data meta-analysis might enable investigators to uniformly adjust survival data and thus provide readers with an unbiased meta-analysis.</P>

<P>None of the previous meta-analyses dedicated to this subject demonstrated a survival advantage for patients undergoing more extended lymphadenectomy (<LINK REF="REF-El_x002d_Sedfy-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">El-Sedfy 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jiang-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jiang 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jiang-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jiang 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Memon-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Memon 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Seevaratnam-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Seevaratnam 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Yang-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yang 2009</LINK>). However, none of the previous meta-analyses took into consideration the DSS, which is the outcome we found associated with a therapeutic benefit in patients undergoing D2 (as compared to those undergoing D1) lymphadenectomy. Moreover, most previous meta-analyses used odds ratio instead of hazard ratio as the effect measure: this method can be misleading since the same number of events in two study arms can occur at a very different average time, which can make the actual survival of the two patient groups very different. This, coupled with the fact that survival data may be censored, makes the hazard ratio the best way of describing time-to-event data such as survival data. Finally, not all previous meta-analyses included the <LINK REF="STD-Cuschieri-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Cuschieri 1999</LINK> trial (for unclear reasons) and none of the previous meta-analyses could consider the latest data from the <LINK REF="STD-Degiuli-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Degiuli 2014</LINK> trial (which was published after their search dates).</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2015-06-23 17:16:09 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Our findings suggest that D2 lymphadenectomy might be currently considered the best surgical option for patients with primary resectable carcinoma of the stomach based on the observed significant benefit in terms of DSS. Since this type of lymph node dissection is associated with increased postoperative mortality (as compared to more limited lymphadenectomy) and in light of the fact that most of the associated mortality is ascribed to the resection of the spleen and of the pancreatic tail, we suggest that D2 lymphadenectomy should be performed without the splenopancreasectomy component. This suggestion - already reported in the international literature (<LINK REF="REF-Brar-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brar 2012</LINK>) - is supported by the findings of a recently published RCT specifically addressing this issue (<LINK REF="STD-Galizia-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Galizia 2015</LINK>), where patients undergoing a modified D2 lymphadenectomy (i.e., without splenopancreasectomy) had the same survival outcome as those undergoing standard D2 lymphadenectomy (i.e., including splenopancreasectomy) but had lower morbidity and mortality rates.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2015-06-02 15:25:35 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The findings of the present review underscore the need for more research in this field. For instance, trials are warranted that investigate the relationship between the therapeutic effect of lymphadenectomy and that of currently available adjuvant (i.e., postoperative) and neoadjuvant (i.e., preoperative) chemo(radio)therapy. In fact, it is still unclear whether medical treatments may replace the potential therapeutic benefit of more extended lymphadenectomy, as well as whether the therapeutic effect of medical treatments can synergize with more extended lymph node dissection (<LINK REF="REF-Jansen-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jansen 2012</LINK>). Moreover, the role of sentinel node biopsy-guided lymphadenectomy (<LINK REF="REF-Yashiro-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yashiro 2015</LINK>) is still to be defined and might result in better management of patients with gastric cancer, as it does for melanoma and breast cancer patients. Finally, the comparison between D3 and D2 lymphadenectomy has thus far been carried out exclusively in Asian patients, which leaves room for similar comparisons in Caucasian patients.</P>
