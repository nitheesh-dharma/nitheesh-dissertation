<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2017-02-10 10:40:09 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>
<B>What is the aim of this review?</B>
<BR/>The aim of this Cochrane Review was to determine whether cataract surgery is safe and improves vision in eyes with age-related macular degeneration (AMD) compared with no surgery. Cochrane researchers collected and analyzed all relevant studies to answer this question and included two studies.</P>
<P>
<B>Key messages</B>
<BR/>Although data from two small studies suggest that surgery to remove cataracts in eyes with AMD may improve vision without worsening of AMD, it is not possible to draw reliable conclusions from the available data at this time. Physicians must decide whether to recommend cataract surgery to their AMD patients based on clinical judgment until larger studies have been conducted and their findings published.</P>
<P>
<B>What was studied in this review?</B>
<BR/>Both cataract and AMD are common causes of poor vision; they often occur together in people over age 50. Cataract occurs when the clear lens in the front of the eye becomes cloudy. Removing the cloudy lens (cataract surgery) restores good vision for many eyes that do not have other eye conditions. AMD is disease in which the macula (the area in the back of the eye that is responsible for central vision) deteriorates. Some physicians believe that cataract surgery may put eyes that have AMD at higher risk of more vision loss than leaving the cloudy lens in the eye.</P>
<P>
<B>What are the main results of this review?</B>
<BR/>This review included two studies comparing immediate cataract surgery (within two weeks) with delayed cataract surgery (at six months) for people who had both cataract and AMD. In one study, the group that received immediate surgery had better vision at six months than the group scheduled for delayed surgery. In the other study, it was unclear which group had better vision improvements at 12 months. No participant in one study had the AMD get worse; AMD got worse in only one person in the immediate-surgery group in the other study. Two studies measured quality of life: one study suggested that the immediate-surgery group had a better quality of life than the delayed-surgery group, and the second study did not report enough information to allow us to analyze the data. Neither study reported adverse events.</P>
<P>
<B>How up-to-date is the review?</B>
<BR/>Cochrane researchers searched for studies that had been published up to 2 December 2016.</P>

<P>Cataract and age-related macular degeneration (AMD) are common causes of decreased vision that often occur simultaneously in people over age 50.

<P>Two review authors independently evaluated the search results against the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Two review authors independently extracted data, assessed risk of bias for included studies, and graded the certainty of evidence. We followed methods as recommended by Cochrane.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-02-06 16:58:46 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included two RCTs with a total of 114 participants (114 study eyes) with visually significant cataract and AMD. We identified no ongoing trials. Participants in each RCT were randomized to immediate cataract surgery (within two weeks of enrollment) or delayed cataract surgery (six months after enrollment). The risk of bias was unclear for most domains in each study; one study was registered prospectively.</P>
<P>In one study conducted in Australia outcomes were reported only at six months (before participants in the delayed-surgery group had cataract surgery). At six months, the immediate-surgery group showed mean improvement in best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) compared with the delayed-surgery group (mean difference (MD) -0.15 LogMAR, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.28 to -0.02; 56 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). In the other study, conducted in Austria, outcomes were reported only at 12 months (12 months after participants in the immediate-surgery group and six months after participants in the delayed-surgery group had cataract surgery). There was uncertainty as to which treatment group had better improvement in distance visual acuity at 12 months (unit of measure not reported; very low-certainty evidence).</P>
<P>At 12 months, the mean change from baseline between groups in cumulated drusen or geographic atrophy area size was small and there was uncertainty which, if either, of the groups was favored (MD 0.76, 95% CI -8.49 to 10.00; 49 participants; low-certainty evidence). No participant in one study had exudative AMD develop in the study eye during 12 months of follow-up; in the other study, choroidal neovascularization developed in the study eye of 1 of 27 participants in the immediate-surgery group versus 0 of 29 participants in the delayed-surgery group at six months (risk ratio 3.21, 95% CI 0.14 to 75.68; 56 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Quality of life was measured using two different questionnaires. Scores on the Impact of Vision Impairment (IVI) questionnaire suggested that the immediate-surgery group fared better regarding vision-related quality of life than the delayed-surgery group at six months (MD in IVI logit scores 1.60, 95% CI 0.61 to 2.59; low-certainty evidence). However, we could not analyze scores from the Visual Function-14 (VF-14) questionnaire from the other study due to insufficient data. No postoperative complication was reported from either study.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2017-02-06 17:04:13 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>At this time, it is not possible to draw reliable conclusions from the available data as to whether cataract surgery is beneficial or harmful in people with AMD after 12 months. Although cataract surgery provides short-term (six months) improvement in BCVA in eyes with AMD compared with no surgery, it is unclear whether the timing of surgery has an effect on long-term outcomes. Physicians must make recommendations to their AMD patients regarding cataract surgery based on experience and clinical judgment until large controlled trials are conducted and their findings published.</P>
<P>There is a need for prospective RCTs in which cataract surgery is compared with no surgery in people with AMD to better evaluate whether cataract surgery is beneficial or harmful in all or a subset of AMD patients. However, ethical considerations preclude withholding surgery, or delaying it for several years, if it may be a potentially beneficial treatment. Designers of future trials are encouraged to utilize existing standardized systems for grading cataract and AMD and for measuring key outcomes: visual acuity, change in visual acuity, worsening of AMD, quality of life measures, and adverse events.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Age-related cataract</HEADING>
<P>Cataract is an opacification of the crystalline lens that most often occurs with age (<LINK REF="REF-AAO-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">AAO 2016</LINK>). According to the World Health Organization (WHO), cataract accounts for 48% of world blindness, affecting nearly 18 million people (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2011</LINK>). The WHO estimates that there will be 54 million people aged 60 years or older who will be blind from cataract by the year 2020, given projected increases in the elderly population in low-, middle-, and high-income countries.</P>
<P>Age-related cataract is a term used to describe any idiopathic lens opacification that occurs in people over 50 years of age. In its early stages, symptoms may be absent or minimal, but progression of lens opacification with time usually causes varying levels of gradual, progressive, painless loss of vision. People with cataract may have increasing difficulty with near or distance vision, or both. Glare may reduce vision in bright daylight and cause trouble with night driving. Other aspects of vision, such as contrast sensitivity, may be affected.</P>
<P>Cataract is diagnosed and assessed with a comprehensive eye exam. Reduction in best-corrected visual acuity is the standard tool used to estimate visual impairment; slit-lamp biomicroscopy allows classification and grading of cataract severity. A dilated fundus examination is performed to identify retinal disease that may complicate or exacerbate the cataract-related impairment. The American Academy of Ophthalmology recognizes the primary indication for cataract surgery as "visual function that no longer meets the affected person's needs and for which cataract surgery provides a reasonable likelihood of improved vision" (<LINK REF="REF-AAO-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">AAO 2016</LINK>). Cataract removal also is indicated when the lens opacity inhibits the proper management of posterior segment disease due to inability to view the fundus is sufficient detail (<LINK REF="REF-AAO-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">AAO 2016</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Age-related macular degeneration</HEADING>
<P>Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of irreversible legal blindness in people 65 years or older; the incidence is expected to increase further with the continued aging of the population. In Americans 40 years or older, the total prevalence of any AMD has been estimated as 9.2%, and the overall prevalence of neovascular AMD or geographic atrophy has been reported to be 1.47% (<LINK REF="REF-EDPRG-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">EDPRG 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Klein-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Klein 1995</LINK>).</P>
<P>Numerous grading systems have been proposed to classify AMD, but no universal consensus exists. The International Epidemiological Age-related Maculopathy Study Group defined age-related maculopathy (ARM) as the presence of drusen larger than 63 microns and retinal pigment epithelium abnormalities, whereas AMD was reserved for late stages of ARM defined by the presence of geographic atrophy (dry AMD) or choroidal neovascularization (CNV; wet AMD) (<LINK REF="REF-Bird-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bird 1995</LINK>). Although neovascular disease constitutes only 15% of AMD, it is responsible for the majority of vision loss (<LINK REF="REF-Ferris-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ferris 1984</LINK>).</P>
<P>Age-related macular degeneration may be asymptomatic in the early stages when only drusen are present (<LINK REF="REF-AAO-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">AAO 2016</LINK>). Further worsening of the disease and increasing pigment alteration can be associated with a gradual visual acuity loss, diminished contrast sensitivity, and a need for increased background illumination. Central geographic atrophy causes irreversible loss of central vision. Choroidal neovascularization may cause scotoma, metamorphopsia, and varying degrees of loss of vision.</P>
<P>Although non-neovascular AMD has no treatment, high-dose vitamin supplementation was shown to reduce the incidence rate of advanced AMD (CNV or central geographic atrophy) in high-risk participants in the Age-Related Eye Disease Study (<LINK REF="REF-AREDS-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">AREDS 2001</LINK>). Antioxidant vitamin and mineral supplements were shown in a systematic review to slow the progression of AMD (<LINK REF="REF-Evans-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Evans 2006</LINK>). Large, well-designed clinical trials have shown people with CNV to benefit when treated with laser photocoagulation (<LINK REF="REF-MPS-Group-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">MPS Group 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-MPS-Group-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">MPS Group 1991</LINK>), photodynamic therapy with verteporfin (<LINK REF="REF-TAP-Study-Group-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">TAP Study Group 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-TAP-Study-Group-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">TAP Study Group 2001</LINK>), or intravitreal pegaptanib (<LINK REF="REF-V.I.S.I.O.N.-Clinical-Trial-Group-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">V.I.S.I.O.N. Clinical Trial Group 2006</LINK>), ranibizumab (<LINK REF="REF-Brown-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brown 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rosenfeld-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rosenfeld 2006</LINK>), bevacizumab (<LINK REF="REF-CATT-Research-Group-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">CATT Research Group 2011</LINK>), and aflibercept (<LINK REF="REF-Ohr-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ohr 2012</LINK>). Visual acuity may continue to decline despite appropriate treatment, however.</P>

</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2017-02-06 17:16:45 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>For age-related cataract, surgery is currently the only treatment option once the lens has opacified enough to cause a significant decrease in vision (<LINK REF="REF-AAO-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">AAO 2016</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ang-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ang 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Riaz-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Riaz 2006</LINK>). There are four main forms of cataract extraction surgery: intracapsular (ICCE), conventional extracapsular (ECCE), extracapsular phacoemulsification, and manual small incision (MSICS). Cochrane systematic reviews have examined various surgical interventions for eyes with age-related cataract (<LINK REF="REF-Ang-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ang 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Riaz-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Riaz 2006</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2017-02-06 14:26:54 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Cataract surgery in middle- and high-income countries most commonly involves small-incision phacoemulsification removal of the lens and insertion of a capsule-supported intraocular lens implant. Vision-limiting operative complications are uncommon. Pooled results of cataract surgery prior to 1992 showed that 95% of participants without underlying ocular comorbidity obtained best-corrected vision of 20/40 or better (<LINK REF="REF-Powe-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Powe 1994</LINK>). When all participants were included, the probability of obtaining 20/40 or better vision was still greater than 90%. Those with underlying ocular conditions such as AMD may experience limited visual improvement. Visual outcomes for various surgical intervention techniques have been systematically reviewed (<LINK REF="REF-Riaz-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Riaz 2006</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2017-02-06 17:21:30 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Our understanding of the interaction of cataract and macular degeneration is still evolving. There is uncertainty regarding the possible benefits or risks of cataract surgery in eyes with AMD. Investigators of some studies have suggested that cataract surgery may hasten the progression of AMD (<LINK REF="REF-Cugati-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cugati 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pollack-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Pollack 1996</LINK>), but others have reported that cataract surgery may be beneficial in this group of patients (<LINK REF="STD-Armbrecht-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Armbrecht 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kuo-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kuo 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shuttleworth-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shuttleworth 1998</LINK>). There are many limitations to these studies. Specifically, in none of these studies was fluorescein angiography performed immediately after surgery to permit determination of whether pre-existing subtle or obvious CNV or central geographic atrophy that already was present but not recognized prior to surgery. One prospective study in which fluorescein angiography was performed immediately prior to cataract surgery and at one week, three months, and one year postoperatively found no evidence to suggest that surgery increased the risk of AMD worsening. Most cases of neovascular AMD not identified pre-operatively were believed to have been obscured by the cataract; however, this was a cohort study that did not compare surgery to no surgery (<LINK REF="REF-Dong-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dong 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>There are several scenarios in which cataract surgery might worsen the progression of AMD. Cataract and AMD share common risk factors, such as smoking and inadequate nutrition, that could cause them to progress simultaneously (<LINK REF="REF-Hiller-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hiller 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jacques-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jacques 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Seddon-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Seddon 2006</LINK>). In addition, inflammatory factors have been implicated in the causation of AMD (<LINK REF="REF-Donoso-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Donoso 2006</LINK>); it is feasible that inflammation occurring after cataract surgery could cause worsening of existing macular degeneration. Moreover, the replacement of the natural lens with an artificial lens may increase exposure to light and damaging ultraviolet rays. Clinicians who believe that cataract surgery increases the risk of AMD worsening may discourage cataract surgery for patients with AMD despite visual loss and lens opacity. On the other hand, CNV or central geographic atrophy may be unrecognized prior to cataract surgery and account for some of the vision loss, thus prompting an ophthalmologist to proceed with cataract surgery and then to conclude that the surgery had an effect on progression to advanced AMD, when in reality cataract surgery merely revealed the advanced stage of AMD. In this review, we analyzed the available evidence from randomized clinical trials regarding the effectiveness and safety of cataract surgery in eyes known to have AMD.</P>

We assessed the following parameters for risk of bias:</P>
<OL>
<LI>generation of random allocation sequence and allocation concealment before randomization (selection bias);</LI>
<LI>masking of study personnel (performance bias);</LI>
<LI>masking of outcome assessors (detection bias);</LI>
<LI>completeness of follow-up and intention-to-treat analysis (attrition bias); and</LI>

<P>We classified each included study for each type of bias as low risk, unclear risk, or high risk of bias. For example, any method of allocation concealment, such as sequentially numbered, opaque envelopes or central allocation, conferred low risk of bias. When no approach to allocation concealment was reported, we considered the risk of bias to be unclear. We considered trial investigators to have conducted an intention-to-treat analysis only when all participants who were randomized, including those who were randomized but not treated, excluded after randomization for other reasons, or lost to follow-up, were reported and accounted for in the data analysis. When the information available in the published trial reports was inadequate to assess the risk of bias, we contacted the trial authors for clarification.

Although higher scores represented poorer quality of life on the questionnaire, data were analyzed using logit units, which resulted in higher mean scores representing better quality life in the analyses. At six months, the immediate-surgery group had higher overall mean IVI scores compared with the delayed-surgery group (MD 1.60, 95% CI 0.61 to 2.59). We graded the certainty of evidence for this outcome as low, downgrading for unclear risks of bias in the trial and imprecision.</P>

<P>The primary outcome for this review was best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) in the operated eye at one-year follow-up. One study reported this outcome; however, there was uncertainty as to how visual acuity was measured and whether the immediate-surgery group or the delayed-surgery group had a better visual acuity at this time point (<LINK REF="STD-Brunner-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Brunner 2013</LINK>). A summary of the main findings of this review are presented in <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>. In <LINK REF="STD-Lamoureux-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Lamoureux 2007</LINK>, the control group (delayed cataract surgery) participants were scheduled to receive surgery at six months after randomization, therefore outcomes at six months were assessed before participants in the delayed surgery had cataract surgery. At six months, better mean BCVA was observed in the immediate-surgery group compared with the delayed-surgery control group (MD -0.15 LogMAR, 95% CI -0.28 to -0.02). Progression of AMD was a secondary outcome. One study reported that exudative AMD had not developed in any participant in either study group (<LINK REF="STD-Brunner-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Brunner 2013</LINK>); in the other study, choroidal neovascularization developed in the study eye of one participant in the immediate surgery group versus none in the delayed surgery group (<LINK REF="STD-Lamoureux-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Lamoureux 2007</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Brunner-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Brunner 2013</LINK> also reported on the size of the cumulated area occupied by drusen and geographic atrophy, and concluded that there was no difference the sizes between the two groups of study eyes (MD 0.76, 95% CI -8.49 to 10.00). Both studies measured vision-related quality of life, but used different instruments and reported data on different scales. <LINK REF="STD-Brunner-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Brunner 2013</LINK> reported the mean scores on the Visual Function-14 (VF-14) scale that were similar in the immediate surgery and delayed surgery groups at 12 months; however, imbalance between groups with respect to baseline scores precluded valid comparison of 12-month scores. <LINK REF="STD-Lamoureux-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Lamoureux 2007</LINK> used the IVI questionnaire; the results at 6 months' follow-up suggested that the immediate-surgery group fared better regarding quality of life outcomes than the delayed-surgery group (MD 1.60 logits, 95% CI 0.61 to 2.59). Neither of the studies reported adverse outcomes.</P>

<P>The relationship between cataract surgery and AMD has been the subject of much debate in recent years. Both conditions are common in the elderly and have overlapping symptoms and risk factors; deciding when or whether to perform cataract surgery in people with AMD can be difficult at best. Some clinicians believe that cataract surgery is beneficial in AMD patients by giving them the best chance of recovering some of the lost vision, even if only for a few months. Other clinicians fear that surgery could exacerbate AMD and lead to worse vision than if the cataract had been left in place. Conflicting reports from retrospective studies have created confusion regarding this issue (<LINK REF="REF-Kaiserman-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kaiserman 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sutter-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sutter 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>In this review we have analyzed the available evidence from prospective randomized controlled trials (RCTs); although we also sought quasi-randomized clinical trials regarding the effectiveness and safety of cataract surgery in eyes with AMD, none was found. Although we defined outcomes at one year as those of primary interest, only one RCT with one-year follow-up was identified from a systematic literature search (<LINK REF="STD-Brunner-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Brunner 2013</LINK>). The next best available evidence from the published literature was one RCT with six-month follow-up (<LINK REF="STD-Lamoureux-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Lamoureux 2007</LINK>). As these studies had different follow-up time points and used different methods, we could not combine the data in meta-analyses.</P>

<P>Both studies appeared to be well designed; however, details of methods required to assess potential risks of bias either were not reported or reported unclearly in the study reports. Selection bias (allocation of group assignments and concealment before assignment) was of particular concern. Due to the nature of the surgical interventions, masking of study participants and personnel was not feasible. We could not ascertain whether outcome assessors who refracted patients and measured visual acuity at follow-up time points knew whether surgery had been performed. Further four participants and five participants respectively were lost to follow-up and not included in analyses in <LINK REF="STD-Lamoureux-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Lamoureux 2007</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Brunner-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Brunner 2013</LINK>.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Evidence from non-randomized clinical trials</HEADING>
<P>The best available evidence for long-term outcomes appears to be from non-randomized clinical trials and prospective observational studies (<LINK REF="REF-Bockelbrink-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bockelbrink 2008</LINK>). Armbrecht and colleagues performed a prospective study in which participants were grouped based on the presence or absence of AMD and cataract surgery. The three groups comprised (1) people with AMD who did not have surgery, (2) people with AMD who underwent cataract surgery, and (3) a control group of people who underwent cataract surgery. Initial results based on five-month data suggested that cataract surgery was most beneficial for people with moderate cataract irrespective of the degree of AMD (<LINK REF="STD-Armbrecht-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Armbrecht 2000</LINK>). Further analysis of people with AMD found that visual acuity and quality of life benefits were maintained at one year (<LINK REF="STD-Armbrecht-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Armbrecht 2003</LINK>). This finding contrasted with previous reports published by Pollack and colleagues, who detected an increased rate of CNV after unilateral cataract surgery in a non-randomized trial (<LINK REF="STD-Pollack-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Pollack 1996</LINK>). </P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Evidence from prospective cohort and case-control studies</HEADING>
<P>Several well-designed epidemiologic studies have addressed the relationship amongst cataract, cataract surgery, and AMD. The Copenhagen City Eye Study, the Beaver Dam Eye Study conducted in the USA, and the Blue Mountains Eye Study conducted in Australia are large cohort studies that have addressed this relationship.</P>
<P>In the Copenhagen City Eye Study, the presence of cataract increased the subsequent incidence of early AMD, whereas cataract surgery increased the incidence of late AMD, defined as geographic atrophy or CNV in the study (<LINK REF="REF-Buch-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Buch 2005</LINK>). Although these findings confirm that the two conditions share common risk factors, it is not possible to state whether surgery itself caused an increased incidence of late AMD. People with neovascular AMD that was not apparent to the cataract surgeon prior to surgery may have undergone cataract surgery more often than those with known AMD.</P>
<P>During ten-year follow-up of the Beaver Dam Eye Study cohort, baseline cataract was found to be associated with early age-related maculopathy (ARM) and progression of ARM, but not with late ARM (<LINK REF="REF-Klein-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Klein 2002</LINK>). Cataract surgery, in contrast, was associated with progression of ARM and late ARM, but not with early ARM. Eyes of participants in the similarly designed Blue Mountains Eye Study had a higher 10-year risk of developing late ARM (geographic atrophy or neovascular AMD) in the presence of previous cataract surgery (<LINK REF="REF-Cugati-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cugati 2006</LINK>). In addition, analysis of combined five-year data from the Beaver Dam Eye Study and the Blue Mountains Eye Study estimated an approximate 10-fold increase in risk of late-stage ARM (geographic atrophy or neovascular AMD) in people with a baseline history of cataract surgery (<LINK REF="REF-Wang-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wang 2003</LINK>). However, it is not possible to infer a causal relationship between cataract surgery and progression of ARM or the presence of late ARM from a cohort study.</P>
<P>A case-control study using the Age-Related Eye Diseases Study (AREDS) database found an increased risk of lens opacities or cataract surgery in participants with large drusen and participants with neovascular AMD (<LINK REF="REF-AREDS-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">AREDS 2000</LINK>). There was no association between lens opacities or previous cataract surgery and geographic atrophy in AREDS. A more recent AREDS report addressed the risk of developing advanced AMD after cataract surgery based on review of annual fundus photographs, but no clear effect of cataract surgery on progression of AMD was found (<LINK REF="REF-Chew-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chew 2009</LINK>).  An earlier publication based on data from a Chesapeake Bay waterman cohort reported a higher incidence of AMD in the presence of nuclear (but not cortical) opacity (<LINK REF="REF-West-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">West 1989</LINK>).</P>

<P>At this time, it is not possible to draw reliable conclusions from the available data regarding whether cataract surgery is beneficial or harmful in people with any stage of age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Physicians must make recommendations regarding cataract surgery to their patients with AMD based on clinical judgment and experience until large, well-designed controlled studies with long-term follow-up are conducted and reported.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2017-02-06 22:42:32 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is a need for clinical researchers to design prospective randomized controlled trials to compare cataract surgery to no surgery in people with AMD to better evaluate whether cataract surgery is beneficial or harmful in this group. However, ethical and feasibility considerations preclude withholding or delaying long-term a potentially beneficial treatment from the control group. We encourage designers of future studies to utilize existing, standardized systems for grading cataract and AMD and measuring and reporting outcomes, such as best-corrected visual acuity, change in visual acuity, worsening of AMD, vision-related quality of life, and other measures of vision such as contrast sensitivity.</P>
