<P>Day hospitals are a less restrictive alternative to inpatient admission for people who are acutely and severely mentally ill. This review compares acute day hospital care to inpatient care. We found that at least one in five patients currently admitted to inpatient care could feasibly be cared for in an acute day hospital. Patients treated in the day hospital had the same levels of treatment satisfaction and quality of life as those cared for as inpatients. The day hospital patients were also no more likely to be unemployed at the end of their care.</P>

<P>We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register (June 2010) which is based on regular searches of MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL and PsycINFO. We approached trialists to identify unpublished studies.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomised controlled trials of day hospital versus inpatient care, for people with acute psychiatric disorders. Studies were ineligible if a majority of participants were under 18 or over 65, or had a primary diagnosis of substance abuse or organic brain disorder.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2011-07-13 13:55:21 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two review authors independently extracted and cross-checked data. We calculated risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous data. We calculated weighted or standardised means for continuous data. Day hospital trials tend to present similar outcomes in slightly different formats, making it difficult to synthesise data. We therefore sought individual patient data so that we could re-analyse outcomes in a common format.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2011-07-13 13:57:29 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Ten trials (involving 2685 people) met the inclusion criteria. We obtained individual patient data for four trials (involving 646 people). We found no difference in the number lost to follow-up by one year between day hospital care and inpatient care (5 RCTs, n = 1694, RR 0.94 CI 0.82 to 1.08). There is moderate evidence that the duration of index admission is longer for patients in day hospital care than inpatient care (4 RCTs, n = 1582, WMD 27.47 CI 3.96 to 50.98).<B> </B>There is very low evidence that the duration of day patient care (adjusted days/month) is longer for patients in day hospital care than inpatient care (3 RCTs, n = 265, WMD 2.34 days/month CI 1.97 to 2.70). There is no difference between day hospital care and inpatient care for the being readmitted to in/day patient care after discharge (5 RCTs, n = 667, RR 0.91 CI 0.72 to 1.15). It is likely that there is no difference between day hospital care and inpatient care for being unemployed at the end of the study (1 RCT, n = 179, RR 0.88 CI 0.66 to 1.19), for quality of life (1 RCT, n = 1117, MD 0.01 CI -0.13 to 0.15) or for treatment satisfaction (1 RCT, n = 1117, MD 0.06 CI -0.18 to 0.30).</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2010-12-01 10:02:59 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Despite the growth of community care, many people with acute psychiatric disorders continue to be treated as inpatients (<LINK REF="REF-DoH-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">DoH 1996</LINK>). This is an expensive way of caring for such patients (<LINK REF="REF-Audit-Comm-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Audit Comm 1994</LINK>) and surveys suggest that it is often unnecessary (<LINK REF="REF-Beck-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beck 1997</LINK>). It has been proposed that many of those currently treated as inpatients could instead be treated in day hospitals (<LINK REF="REF-Pang-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pang 1985</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2011-07-13 19:05:14 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The psychiatric day hospital has been defined as a unit that provides "diagnostic and treatment services for acutely ill patients who would otherwise be treated on traditional psychiatric inpatient units" (<LINK REF="REF-Rosie-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rosie 1987</LINK>). The acute psychiatric day hospital is to be distinguished from other types of "partial hospitalisation" or "day care" such as transitional care for patients leaving hospital, more intensive alternatives to outpatient care (day treatment programmes) and support of long-term patients living in the community (day care centres) (<LINK REF="REF-Hoge-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hoge 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rosie-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rosie 1987</LINK>).</P>
<P>Psychiatric day hospitals were first described in the Soviet Union in the 1930s where they arose as a result of bed shortages (<LINK REF="REF-Volovik-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Volovik 1986</LINK>). The first North American day hospital was opened in Montreal, Quebec in 1946, also in an attempt to reduce the demand for inpatient beds (<LINK REF="REF-Cameron-1947" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cameron 1947</LINK>). In the USA day hospitals became a popular way of treating people in the 1960s following the 1963 Community Mental Health Center Construction Act, which set in law the need to establish partial hospitalisation programmes (<LINK REF="REF-Pang-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pang 1985</LINK>). Similar developments encouraged the growth of day hospitals in the UK in the 1960s, and in the Netherlands and West Germany in the 1970s (<LINK REF="REF-Schene-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schene 1986</LINK>). In the 1980s, however, research commissioned by the American Psychiatric Association showed widespread closure of partial hospitalisation programmes and a low rate of growth in the numbers of patients served by such programmes (<LINK REF="REF-Krizay-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Krizay 1989</LINK>).</P>
<P>A number of factors appear to have contributed to the decline. First, there was a growing awareness of the limited evidence for the effectiveness and cost effectiveness of day hospitals (<LINK REF="REF-Creed-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Creed 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vaughn-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vaughn 1983</LINK>). Second, day hospitals faced competition from more radical "non-institutional" alternatives, such as assertive community treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Hoge-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hoge 1992</LINK>). Third, confusion over the role of day hospitals led to some becoming expensive day centres, as they were overwhelmed by inappropriately placed long-term patients (<LINK REF="REF-Pryce-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pryce 1982</LINK>). Despite these problems, remorseless pressure on inpatient facilities has led to continued interest in psychiatric day hospitals and has inspired the development of new-style day hospitals augmented by outreach services, crisis beds, and extended hours programmes (<LINK REF="STD-Creed_x002d_UK_x002d_1996" TYPE="STUDY">Creed-UK-1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schene-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schene 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sledge_x002d_US_x002d_1996" TYPE="STUDY">Sledge-US-1996</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2011-07-13 14:01:35 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Proponents have claimed that day hospitals can provide more cost-effective care by: promoting quicker recovery (<LINK REF="REF-Cameron-1947" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cameron 1947</LINK>), improving social functioning (<LINK REF="REF-Greene-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Greene 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schene-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schene 1986</LINK>), reducing family burden (<LINK REF="REF-Pang-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pang 1985</LINK>), shortening the duration of hospital care (<LINK REF="REF-Parker-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parker 1990</LINK>) and reducing relapse rates (<LINK REF="REF-Moscowitz-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moscowitz 1980</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2011-07-13 14:01:51 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Despite 50 years of research, opinion remains divided on the cost effectiveness of day hospital treatment. Critics highlight the high rates of patients lost to follow-up in day hospital studies (<LINK REF="REF-Wilkinson-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wilkinson 1984</LINK>), and question whether day hospital treatment might actually 'institutionalise' patients by encouraging them to attend for overlong periods of time (<LINK REF="REF-Hoge-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hoge 1992</LINK>).</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">1. Primary objective</HEADING>
<P>To assess the effects of admission to a psychiatric day hospital versus admission to inpatient care for people with acute psychiatric disorders.</P>

<P>In the first version of this review, MM and AA independently inspected abstracts of the reports identified by the search. We identified potentially relevant abstracts (i.e. those in which a group of day hospital patients meeting the patient inclusion criteria were compared against a control group) and ordered full papers. A reliability study found complete agreement on which trials met inclusion criteria.</P>
<P>In the latest version, reviewer NM inspected all abstracts of studies identified as above and identified potentially relevant reports. In addition, to ensure reliability, KSW inspected a random sample of these abstracts, comprising 10% of the total. Where disagreement occurred we resolved this by discussion, or where there was still doubt, we acquired the full article for further inspection. When we had acquired the full articles of relevant reports for reassessment, we carefully inspected for a final decision on inclusion (see <LINK TAG="SELECTION_CRITERIA" TYPE="SECTION">Criteria for considering studies for this review</LINK>). Once we had obtained the full articles, NM and KSW in turn inspected all full reports and independently decided whether they met inclusion criteria. NM and KSW were not blinded to the names of the authors, institutions or journal of publication. Where difficulties or disputes arose, we asked author JM for help and if it was impossible to decide, added these studies to those awaiting assessment and contacted the authors of the papers for clarification.</P>

<P>In the first version of the review, where further clarification was needed, we contacted the authors of trials to provide missing data. We sought individual patient data for all patients randomised in eligible trials (published or unpublished). We verified all individual patient data received against the original trial reports. We resolved any queries by contacting the trialists. For trials where individual patient data were not available, two authors extracted categorical and continuous data separately from trial reports and another cross checked (MM and either AA or RC).</P>
<P>In the latest version, authors NM and KSW independently extracted data from the single included study. We discussed any disagreement and documented decisions. With remaining problems JM helped clarify issues and we documented those final decisions. We extracted data presented only in graphs and figures whenever possible, but included them only if two authors independently had the same result.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="6">1.2.1 Feasibility of hospital treatment</HEADING>
<P>We have defined the feasibility of day hospital treatment as the percentage reduction in acute inpatient admissions that could be achieved by diverting patients to an acute day hospital. We estimated feasibility by a modification of the method suggested by Kluiter (<LINK REF="STD-Wiersma_x002d_NL_x002d_1989" TYPE="STUDY">Wiersma-NL-1989</LINK>), the general formula being: 100 x number engaging in day hospital treatment/(number assessed for eligibility x R), where R is the randomisation ratio for the trial (defined as number randomised to day hospital divided by number of patients randomised). However, estimates of feasibility are profoundly affected by judgements about what is 'engagement' in day hospital treatment and how many patients have been assessed for eligibility. We therefore decided to perform a sensitivity analysis to give a best and worst estimate of feasibility for each included trial.</P>
<P>We based the best estimate on defining: i. engagement in day hospital as the number randomised to day hospital treatment; and ii. assessed for eligibility as the number remaining after exclusions for administrative reasons. We defined patients excluded for administrative reasons as those who were too well to be randomised to day care, left before they could be assessed or lived outside the study catchment area. We based the worst estimate of feasibility on defining: i. engagement in day hospital as the number randomised to day hospital treatment (those admitted as inpatients in the first four weeks + the number of day patients who did not turn up for day hospital treatment); and ii. assessed for eligibility as the number presenting for admission before any administrative exclusions were made. We derived a weighted average for the best and worst estimates of feasibility derived in this way. However, for a minority of trials (referred to as 'Type 2' trials, see <LINK TAG="STUDY_DESCRIPTION" TYPE="SECTION">Description of studies</LINK> below), we could not apply this formula for calculating feasibility because all patients were admitted to inpatient care before randomisation to continuing inpatient care or day hospital care. For these trials, we calculated a single estimate of feasibility, based on those patients randomised to day hospital care who experienced only a brief episode of inpatient care before transfer to a day hospital. We estimated number lost to follow-up by taking the number who were not re-interviewed at the final follow-up assessment. We assumed that clients lost to follow-up also dropped out of care.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">1.2.2 Economic data</HEADING>
<P>We have not combined individual patient data on economic variables across trials because there is no agreed method for overcoming the problems caused by differences in costing methodology between trials and between countries. Instead, we have presented these data adjusted to a common format (see <LINK TAG="CRIT_OUTCOMES" TYPE="SECTION">Types of outcome measures</LINK> above) in the currencies used in the original trials. We then calculated percentage differences in costs between treatment and control conditions and, where possible, compared costs of treatment and control care using non-parametric tests. For <LINK REF="STD-Creed_x002d_UK_x002d_1990" TYPE="STUDY">Creed-UK-1990</LINK>, we calculated costs of hospital care using individual patient data, working on the assumption that the relative costs of day hospital and inpatient care were similar to those reported in <LINK REF="STD-Creed_x002d_UK_x002d_1996" TYPE="STUDY">Creed-UK-1996</LINK> (both trials took place in the same day hospital with the same general hospital control).</P>

<P>We included continuous data from rating scales only if:</P>
<P>a) the psychometric properties of the measuring instrument had been described in a peer-reviewed journal (<LINK REF="REF-Marshall-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marshall 2000</LINK>); and<BR/>b) the measuring instrument was not written or modified by one of the trialists for that particular trial; and<BR/>c) the measuring instrument is either i. a self-report or ii. completed by an independent rater or relative (not the therapist).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">2.3 Endpoint versus change data</HEADING>
<P>We preferred to use scale endpoint data, which typically cannot have negative values and are easier to interpret from a clinical point of view. Change data are often not ordinal and are very problematic to interpret. If endpoint data were unavailable, we used change data.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">2.4 Skewed data</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">2.4.1 General</HEADING>
<P>Continuous data on clinical and social outcomes are often not normally distributed. To avoid the pitfall of applying parametric tests to non-parametric data, we aim to apply the following standards to all data before inclusion: a) standard deviations and means are reported in the paper or obtainable from the authors; b) when a scale starts from the finite number zero, the standard deviation, when multiplied by two, is less than the mean (as otherwise the mean is unlikely to be an appropriate measure of the centre of the distribution, (<LINK REF="REF-Altman-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Altman 1996</LINK>); c) if a scale starts from a positive value (such as PANSS which can have values from 30 to 210) we will modify the calculation described above to take the scale starting point into account. In these cases skew is present if 2SD&gt;(S-S min), where S is the mean score and S min is the minimum score. Endpoint scores on scales often have a finite start and end point and these rules can be applied. When continuous data are presented on a scale which includes a possibility of negative values (such as change data), it is difficult to tell whether data are skewed or not. We entered skewed data from studies of less than 200 participants in additional tables rather than into an analysis. Skewed data pose less of a problem when looking at means if the sample size is large and were entered into syntheses.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">2.4.2 Specific</HEADING>
<P>Data concerning use of hospital care were skewed, but we have nonetheless presented them on Review Manager (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2008</LINK>) to facilitate comparison between trials. However, the results of any parametric analyses on these data were cross-checked using the non-parametric Mann-Whitney U statistic.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">2.5 Common measure</HEADING>
<P>To facilitate comparison between trials, we converted variables that can be reported in different metrics, such as days in hospital (mean days per year, per week or per month) to a common metric (e.g. mean days per month). We adjusted time spent in the day hospital so that 'days in day hospital' represented the actual number of attendances at the day hospital (excluding missed days), rather than the total time for which the patient was a day hospital patient (except in the case of duration of initial admission). <LINK REF="STD-Creed_x002d_UK_x002d_1990" TYPE="STUDY">Creed-UK-1990</LINK> did not distinguish between duration of care and actual number of attendances, so actual number of attendances was estimated using the same ratio of duration: actual attendances reported in <LINK REF="STD-Creed_x002d_UK_x002d_1996" TYPE="STUDY">Creed-UK-1996</LINK> (which took place in the same day hospital using the same hospital control).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">2.6 Conversion of continuous to binary</HEADING>
<P>Where possible, we attempted to convert outcome measures to dichotomous data. This could be done by identifying cut-off points on rating scales and dividing participants accordingly into 'clinically improved' or 'not clinically improved'. We generally assumed that, if there had been a 50% reduction in a scale-derived score such as the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS, <LINK REF="REF-Overall-1962" TYPE="REFERENCE">Overall 1962</LINK>) or the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS, <LINK REF="REF-Kay-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kay 1986</LINK>), this could be considered as a clinically significant response (<LINK REF="REF-Leucht-2005a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leucht 2005a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Leucht-2005b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leucht 2005b</LINK>). If data based on these thresholds were not available, we used the primary cut-off presented by the original authors.</P>

<P>KSW and NM independently assessed the risk of bias of each trial using The Cochrane Collaboration's risk of bias tool (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2009</LINK>). We created a form following the guidance to make judgments on the risk of bias in six domains: sequence generation; allocation concealment; blinding (of participants, personnel, and outcome assessors); incomplete outcome data; selective outcome reporting; and other sources of bias. We categorised these judgments as 'yes' (low risk of bias), 'no' (high risk of bias), or 'unclear'. We resolved disagreements through discussion and by consulting MM.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">1. Binary data</HEADING>
<P>For binary outcomes we calculated a standard estimation of the risk ratio (RR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI). It has been shown that RR is more intuitive (<LINK REF="REF-Boissel-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boissel 1999</LINK>) than odds ratios and that odds ratios tend to be interpreted as RR by clinicians (<LINK REF="REF-Deeks-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deeks 2000</LINK>). For statistically significant results we had planned to calculate the number needed to treat to provide benefit/to induce harm statistic (NNTB/H), and its 95% CI using Visual Rx (http://www.nntonline.net/), taking account of the event rate in the control group.

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">1. Cluster trials</HEADING>
<P>Studies increasingly employ 'cluster randomisation' (such as randomisation by clinician or practice) but analysis and pooling of clustered data poses problems. Authors often fail to account for intraclass correlation in clustered studies, leading to a 'unit of analysis' error (<LINK REF="REF-Divine-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Divine 1992</LINK>) whereby P values are spuriously low, CI unduly narrow and statistical significance overestimated. This causes type I errors (<LINK REF="REF-Bland-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bland 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gulliford-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gulliford 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>Where clustering is not accounted for in primary studies, we presented data in a table, with a (*) symbol to indicate the presence of a probable unit of analysis error. In subsequent versions of this review we will seek to contact first authors of studies to obtain intraclass correlation coefficients for their clustered data and to adjust for this by using accepted methods (<LINK REF="REF-Gulliford-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gulliford 1999</LINK>). Where clustering had been incorporated into the analysis of primary studies, we present these data as if from a non-cluster randomised study, but adjusted for the clustering effect.</P>
<P>We have sought statistical advice and have been advised that the binary data as presented in a report should be divided by a 'design effect'. This is calculated using the mean number of participants per cluster (m) and the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) [Design effect =1+(m-1)*ICC] (<LINK REF="REF-Donner-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Donner 2002</LINK>). If the ICC was not reported it was assumed to be 0.1 (<LINK REF="REF-Ukoumunne-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ukoumunne 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>If cluster studies had been appropriately analysed, taking into account intraclass correlation coefficients and relevant data documented in the report, synthesis with other studies would have been possible using the generic inverse variance technique.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">2. Cross-over trials</HEADING>
<P>A major concern of cross-over trials is the carry-over effect. It occurs if an effect (e.g. pharmacological, physiological or psychological) of the treatment in the first phase is carried over to the second phase. As a consequence, on entry to the second phase the participants can differ systematically from their initial state despite a wash-out phase. For the same reason cross-over trials are not appropriate if the condition of interest is unstable (<LINK REF="REF-Elbourne-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elbourne 2002</LINK>). As both effects are very likely in severe mental illness, we will only use data of the first phase of cross-over studies.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">3.2 Standard deviations</HEADING>
<P>We first tried to obtain the missing values from the authors. If not available, where there were missing measures of variance for continuous data but an exact standard error and confidence interval were available for group means, and either P value or T value were available for differences in mean, we calculated them according to the rules described in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2009</LINK>). When only the standard error (SE) is reported, standard deviations (SDs) are calculated by the formula SD =SE * square root (n). Chapters 7.7.3 and 16.1.3 of the <I>Handbook</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2009</LINK>) present detailed formula for estimating SDs from P values, T or F values, confidence intervals, ranges or other statistics. If these formulae do not apply, we calculated the SDs according to a validated imputation method which is based on the SDs of the other included studies (<LINK REF="REF-Furukawa-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Furukawa 2006</LINK>). Although some of these imputation strategies can introduce error, the alternative would be to exclude a given study&#8217;s outcome and thus to lose information. We nevertheless examined the validity of the imputations in a sensitivity analysis excluding imputed values.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">3.3 Last observation carried forward</HEADING>
<P>We anticipated that in some studies the method of last observation carried forward (LOCF) would be employed within the study report. As with all methods of imputation to deal with missing data, LOCF introduces uncertainty about the reliability of the results. Therefore, where LOCF data have been used in the trial, if less than 50% of the data have been assumed, we reproduced these data and indicated that they are the product of LOCF assumptions.</P>

Two trials took place in the same day hospital in an inner city area of Manchester, UK (<LINK REF="STD-Creed_x002d_UK_x002d_1990" TYPE="STUDY">Creed-UK-1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Creed_x002d_UK_x002d_1996" TYPE="STUDY">Creed-UK-1996</LINK>). In the earlier trial, eligible patients were voluntary patients who were not too ill for day care, and who had no social factors that made day care impractical (such as being of no fixed abode). In addition to these criteria, the later trial excluded patients with organic brain disease or mania. <LINK REF="STD-Dick_x002d_UK_x002d_1985" TYPE="STUDY">Dick-UK-1985</LINK> took place in an acute day hospital in Dundee, Scotland.

<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Creed_x002d_UK_x002d_1990" TYPE="STUDY">Creed-UK-1990</LINK>, eight nurses and three occupational therapists staffed the day hospital with input from three consultant psychiatrists. In <LINK REF="STD-Creed_x002d_UK_x002d_1996" TYPE="STUDY">Creed-UK-1996</LINK>, the day hospital had similar staffing levels to <LINK REF="STD-Creed_x002d_UK_x002d_1990" TYPE="STUDY">Creed-UK-1990</LINK>, but there was additional input from a community psychiatric nurse (who could visit patients who failed to turn up for treatment) and an out of hours on-call service for day patients. In <LINK REF="STD-Dick_x002d_UK_x002d_1985" TYPE="STUDY">Dick-UK-1985</LINK> the day hospital was staffed by two trained staff and an occupational therapist and had a staff-patient ratio of 1:12.5. The day hospital offered individual counselling, groups, activities and medication. In <LINK REF="STD-Herz_x002d_US_x002d_1971" TYPE="STUDY">Herz-US-1971</LINK> the day hospital offered group-oriented psychotherapy; staffing levels were not reported. In <LINK REF="STD-Kallert_x002d_EU_x002d_2007" TYPE="STUDY">Kallert-EU-2007</LINK> the day hospitals provided between 15 and 35 places, with mean staff hours per week per treatment place ranging from 8.8 to 16.0. General clinical expertise was high in all centres. Within the centres, the day hospital and inpatient settings varied, but not systematically. In the Dresden day hospital they specialised in outreach activities and vocational rehabilitation, and in Wroclaw there were similar differences; in London &#8220;psychological interventions&#8221; for inpatients were limited to supportive talks; in Wroclaw and Michalovce there was a low level of general hospitals. In Prague, the there were no differences between the settings. In <LINK REF="STD-Kris_x002d_US_x002d_1965" TYPE="STUDY">Kris-US-1965</LINK>, the day hospital offered milieu and group therapy; staffing levels were not reported. In <LINK REF="STD-Schene_x002d_NL_x002d_1993" TYPE="STUDY">Schene-NL-1993</LINK>, the day hospital offered psychosocial therapy and had a staff:patient ratio of 1:12.5. In <LINK REF="STD-Sledge_x002d_US_x002d_1996" TYPE="STUDY">Sledge-US-1996</LINK>, the day hospital was a 20-patient facility staffed by doctors, nurses, social workers and other therapists. Treatment emphasised group work, control of symptoms and improvement in daily living skills. The day hospital was linked to a crisis residence, which was a three-bedroom apartment supported by a crisis respite unit. In <LINK REF="STD-Wiersma_x002d_NL_x002d_1989" TYPE="STUDY">Wiersma-NL-1989</LINK>, the day hospital was supported by integrated ambulatory and domiciliary care and by a back-up bed on the inpatient ward. A 24-hour telephone help-line was available to all day hospital patients. The day hospital offered a multi-disciplinary treatment programme, but staffing levels were not reported. In <LINK REF="STD-Zwerling_x002d_US_x002d_1964" TYPE="STUDY">Zwerling-US-1964</LINK>, the day hospital offered group-oriented activities and family therapy for up to 30 patients.

<P>i. Social Behaviour Assessment Schedule (burden sub-scale, <LINK REF="REF-Platt-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Platt 1981</LINK>)<BR/>This was used in <LINK REF="STD-Creed_x002d_UK_x002d_1990" TYPE="STUDY">Creed-UK-1990</LINK>. This is a large structured interview-based (329 questions) instrument to assess disturbed behaviour, social performance and burden on household/home/institute personnel. Extensive training is needed and the administration of the SBAS takes approximately one hour. The burden section has been used on its own and the 35 items are always applicable to all participants; it is the score of these items that is often used for comparative studies. All items are to be scored 0-3 (no distress, distress, resignation). The time window is at least one month.

Although the trials differed in the choice of questionnaire instruments and time points for follow-up data collection (<LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>), it was possible to combine the individual patient data from the trials. <LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK> gives a breakdown of demographic characteristics of patients from these trials. Forty-two (8.6 %) people had to be dropped from the statistical modelling of outcome due to incomplete covariate data.

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">1.4 Mental state (at various time points)</HEADING>
<P>Due to absence of follow-up mental state data, we were unable to include a further 37 patients (7.6%) in this analysis. These were divided between as follows: seven from <LINK REF="STD-Creed_x002d_UK_x002d_1990" TYPE="STUDY">Creed-UK-1990</LINK> (five inpatients and two day patients), seven from <LINK REF="STD-Creed_x002d_UK_x002d_1996" TYPE="STUDY">Creed-UK-1996</LINK> (five inpatients and two day patients) and 23 from <LINK REF="STD-Sledge_x002d_US_x002d_1996" TYPE="STUDY">Sledge-US-1996</LINK> (16 inpatients and seven day patients). There was evidence of curvature of the profiles and positive skew, so we used a square root transformation. The square root transformed profiles were more linear and the patient and time-point level residuals less skewed. There was evidence of both a significant random intercept (Chi<SUP>2</SUP> = 180.25, P &lt; 0.001) and a significant random slope effect (Chi<SUP>2</SUP> = 25.46, P &lt; 0.001) measured by change in log-likelihood, so we included both these terms in the statistical modelling. When a full model including time-treatment interaction was compared with a reduced model without the interaction, there was evidence of a significant time-treatment interaction measured by change in log likelihood (Chi<SUP>2</SUP> = 9.66, P = 0.002). The difference in slope was -0.007 (CI -0.011 to -0.002) with the negative coefficient representing increased improvement in the day hospital group (<LINK REF="TBL-04" TYPE="TABLE">Table 4</LINK>).The intervention group had a significant effect (Chi<SUP>2</SUP> = 4.58, P = 0.032), indicating a difference in baseline levels for the two groups. The difference was 0.144 (CI 0.009 to 0.278), representing a higher baseline for the day hospital group. To ensure that this difference was not causing the difference in slope, we repeated the analysis without this term so forcing a common baseline to be modelled. The overall conclusion did not alter, indicating that the differing baseline values were not causing the significant difference between slopes. None of the other covariates had a significant effect. Unfortunately it is not possible to estimate the extent of the difference in improvement rates, as back transformation of square-root transformed data is not easily interpreted. <LINK REF="STD-Dick_x002d_UK_x002d_1985" TYPE="STUDY">Dick-UK-1985</LINK> (which did not provide individual patient data) also measured mental state using the Clinical Interview Schedule (<LINK REF="REF-Goldberg-1972" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goldberg 1972</LINK>) at 0.75, four and 12 months. No standard deviations were provided, but a significant difference in favour of day hospital treatment was reported at 0.75 months, but not at the other time points (decrease in score: 0.75 ms DP 13.6 IP 9.6, P &lt; 0.001 T test; 4ms DP 16.2 IP 11.6, P = ns; 12 ms DP 20 IP 14.1, P = ns).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">1.5 Social functioning (at various time points)</HEADING>
<P>Due to absence of follow-up social functioning data, we were unable to include 149 patients (30.6%) from Type 1 trials in the analysis of data. These were divided between the studies as follows: 15 from <LINK REF="STD-Creed_x002d_UK_x002d_1990" TYPE="STUDY">Creed-UK-1990</LINK> (nine inpatients and six day patients); 83 from <LINK REF="STD-Creed_x002d_UK_x002d_1996" TYPE="STUDY">Creed-UK-1996</LINK> (43 inpatients and 40 day patients); and 51 from <LINK REF="STD-Sledge_x002d_US_x002d_1996" TYPE="STUDY">Sledge-US-1996</LINK> (32 inpatients and 19 day patients). There was evidence of a significant random intercept (Chi<SUP>2</SUP> = 62.58, P &lt; 0.001), but no significant random slope effect (Chi<SUP>2</SUP> = 0.80, P = 0.67) measured by change in log-likelihood, so only the random intercept was included in the statistical modelling. When a full model, including time-treatment interaction, was compared with a reduced model without the interaction, there was no evidence of a time-treatment interaction measured by change in log likelihood (Chi<SUP>2</SUP> = 0.006, P = 0.941, see <LINK REF="TBL-05" TYPE="TABLE">Table 5</LINK>). There was a significant age (Chi<SUP>2</SUP> = 7.82, P = 0.005) and a significant gender effect (Chi<SUP>2</SUP> = 21.95, P &lt; 0.001), with increased age having a positive effect on improvement and males improving less.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2011-07-14 16:23:58 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review updates a previous version (<LINK REF="REF-Marshall-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marshall 2002</LINK>). A major improvement is the addition of a large EU-multicentre trial (<LINK REF="STD-Kallert_x002d_EU_x002d_2007" TYPE="STUDY">Kallert-EU-2007</LINK>), which was based on the recommendations of <LINK REF="REF-Marshall-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marshall 2002</LINK> - namely:</P>

<LI>recognised the need for a multi-centre randomised controlled trial to show how far the findings from the present small number of centres can be more widely replicated;</LI>
<LI>made use of the common set of outcome measures used in this review; and</LI>
<LI>took care to report data on mortality and other untoward events and quality of life.</LI>
</OL>
<P>The summary below reflects the outcomes chosen for the <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>, and is considered the main findings of this review for support of evidence-based decision making.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">1. Feasibility and engagement: lost to follow-up by one year</HEADING>
<P>It is reasonable to assume that there is no difference between day hospital care and inpatient care for feasibility and engagement; although the quality of the evidence is moderate there was also a moderate level of heterogeneity in the pooled data. This is likely to be because of a single, small trial with very high risk of biased results favouring the day hospital intervention (<LINK REF="STD-Sledge_x002d_US_x002d_1996" TYPE="STUDY">Sledge-US-1996</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">2. Extent of hospital care: duration of index admission and duration of day patient care (adjusted days/month)</HEADING>
<P>There is moderately strong evidence that the duration of index admission is longer for patients in day hospital care than inpatient care. The results are highly heterogeneous, which is largely due to a single study (<LINK REF="STD-Sledge_x002d_US_x002d_1996" TYPE="STUDY">Sledge-US-1996</LINK>), which had a high risk of bias and different results from other included trials. (If this trial is removed heterogeneity falls - I<SUP>2</SUP> 7% - and confidence in the result increases (MD 33.98 CI 26.18 to 41.78) but the overall direction and extent of finding is similar.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">3. Extent of hospital care: duration of day patient care (adjusted days/month)</HEADING>
<P>The quality of the evidence is very low regarding duration of day patient care (adjusted days/month). The impression is that this is longer for patients in day hospital care than those in inpatient care.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">4. Extent of hospital care: readmitted to in/day patient care after discharge</HEADING>
<P>It is reasonable to assume that there is no difference between day hospital care and inpatient care for the being readmitted to in/day patient care after discharge, although the quality of evidence so far is very low.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">5. Unemployed (at end of study)</HEADING>
<P>There is some evidence that day hospital is superior to inpatient care regarding unemployment at the end of the study. However, the evidence is of low quality as it comes from only two small studies, both of which had limitations in the study design.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">6. Quality of life and treatment satisfaction</HEADING>
<P>It is likely that there is no difference between day hospital care and inpatient care for quality of life and treatment satisfaction. The data for this outcome are only from the most recent large multi-centre trial (<LINK REF="STD-Kallert_x002d_EU_x002d_2007" TYPE="STUDY">Kallert-EU-2007</LINK>), therefore the quality of the evidence was rated as moderate.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">1. Completeness</HEADING>
<P>After taking individual patient data into account, trials provided useable data on all the outcomes defined under <LINK TAG="CRIT_OUTCOMES" TYPE="SECTION">Types of outcome measures</LINK> above.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">2. Applicability</HEADING>
<P>A limitation in the applicability of the review is an apparent difference in practice between US and EU day hospitals. Data on duration of index admission (both IPD data and other aggregate data) suggests that US acute day hospitals are geared towards intensive treatment and rapid discharge, whereas EU day hospitals allow a more gradual tailing off of day care. It is unclear how far this difference has implications for effectiveness or cost. Inclusion criteria do not appear to be an important limitation on the applicability of the review. Generally Type 1 trials used similar explicit inclusion criteria (that exclude involuntary, suicidal or dangerous patients), with the exceptions of <LINK REF="STD-Kris_x002d_US_x002d_1965" TYPE="STUDY">Kris-US-1965</LINK> (which contributed little data to the meta-analysis) and <LINK REF="STD-Creed_x002d_UK_x002d_1996" TYPE="STUDY">Creed-UK-1996</LINK> (which excluded patients with mania).</P>
<P>A limitation of this review is that, although we have some information about costs, a proper cost-effectiveness analysis of day hospital versus inpatient care is missing and would be an important addition to this review.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2011-07-13 22:40:59 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Evidence is estimated to be of moderate quality (based on <A HREF="http://ims.cochrane.org/revman/gradepro">GRADE</A>). The additional trial, <LINK REF="STD-Kallert_x002d_EU_x002d_2007" TYPE="STUDY">Kallert-EU-2007</LINK>, was instigated following the findings of the previous version of this review (<LINK REF="REF-Marshall-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marshall 2002</LINK>) and tried to encompass relevant outcomes. This was an important addition to the review as it increases the confidence in the results for the outcomes for which it contributed data, although some of the outcomes were measured on different scales and so could not be pooled. This trial was of very low risk of bias and carried more weight than the other pooled trials, and was treated as such when assessing the risk of bias for the measured outcomes. In terms of allocation concealment, the quality of included studies was varied; <LINK REF="STD-Creed_x002d_UK_x002d_1990" TYPE="STUDY">Creed-UK-1990</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Creed_x002d_UK_x002d_1996" TYPE="STUDY">Creed-UK-1996</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kallert_x002d_EU_x002d_2007" TYPE="STUDY">Kallert-EU-2007</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Zwerling_x002d_US_x002d_1964" TYPE="STUDY">Zwerling-US-1964</LINK> were good, but the remaining studies were poor. Whilst no trial used evaluators who were blind to group allocation, due to the nature of the interventions, in all studies for which we obtained individual patient data, the authors confirmed that evaluations were performed by independent evaluators. Follow-up rates were generally sub-optimal, and were below 80% in all trials providing individual patient data. The fact that high attrition rates are common to all recent trials suggests the problem lies in working with an acutely ill study population, rather than reflecting design limitations in any particular trial. It is, however, feasible that there is a problem common to all trial design. There was no evidence of a difference in follow-up rates between treatment and controls in trials providing individual patient data, so it is unlikely that lower attrition rates would have had an impact on the findings of this review; however this possibility cannot be absolutely discounted.</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2011-07-13 22:41:35 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Significant attempts have been made to avoid bias in the review process: we sought individual patient data from most studies and we did not combine data from Type 1 and Type 2 trials. We are aware that there is still the potential for bias. However, the additional trial included was based on the previous version of this review and took into account in the study design the recommendations of this review. It was not possible to tell if there was publication bias, as there were only 10 included trials and a funnel plot is unreliable in this case.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2011-08-02 18:35:11 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]" NOTES="&lt;p&gt;Comparison with Assertive Commuity Treatment - the 23% achieved by day hospitals was in the previous discussion of this review. We have not included this information in this version of the discussion as it is not one of the main outcomes in GRADE. Is this section still relevant?&lt;/p&gt;" NOTES_MODIFIED="2011-08-02 18:35:11 +0100" NOTES_MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The evidence is of moderate quality, and there is reasonable evidence to support the use of day hospital care to reduce inpatient care whilst improving patient outcome amongst those suitable for day hospital care, so it is curious that they are not more popular. In part this may be due to the difficulties in interpreting day hospital trials, or the fickleness of psychiatric opinion (see introduction). On the other hand there are three disadvantages of day hospital treatment that need to be considered.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">1. Day hospital treatment does not appear to be as effective in reducing admission rates as more radical crisis intervention approaches</HEADING>
<P>For example, Assertive Community Treatment, when used to divert patients from hospital, can achieve a 55% reduction in admissions as against the 23% achieved by day hospitals (see <LINK REF="REF-Irving-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Irving 2010</LINK> for a systematic review). However, the fact that acute day hospitals do not involve radical, and perhaps unsustainable, alternations in psychiatric practice (<LINK REF="REF-Irving-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Irving 2010</LINK>) needs to be considered.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">2. Cost savings achieved by day hospital care are at best modest</HEADING>
<P>For example, compared with savings of up to 65% reported in studies of crisis intervention (<LINK REF="REF-Marshall-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marshall 1999</LINK>), acute day hospital care (taking a pessimistic estimate) can be expected to achieve a saving of 4.8% in the costs of acute psychiatric care (calculated as: cost savings inpatients diverted multiplied by the proportion of patients diverted, i.e. 20.9 x 0.232, assuming no inpatient beds were closed). Moreover the cost equation would appear as yet more unfavourable if it were necessary to build the day hospital, rather than change practice in an existing non-acute day hospital. On the other hand, so far it has proven difficult to reliably quantify exactly how much is saved by crisis intervention approaches (<LINK REF="REF-Joy-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Joy 2000</LINK>). Moreover, if acute day hospitals proved to be more sustainable than crisis intervention alternatives, this might mean that inpatient beds could actually be closed, thus shifting the cost equation in favour of day hospital care. Future versions of this review will have more information about costs as <LINK REF="STD-Kallert_x002d_EU_x002d_2007" TYPE="STUDY">Kallert-EU-2007</LINK> reports on costs in a report written in German, which is yet to be translated.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">3. It is not clear where day hospitals fit with other types of care</HEADING>
<P>The third disadvantage is that whilst more recent trials (<LINK REF="STD-Creed_x002d_UK_x002d_1996" TYPE="STUDY">Creed-UK-1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kallert_x002d_EU_x002d_2007" TYPE="STUDY">Kallert-EU-2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sledge_x002d_US_x002d_1996" TYPE="STUDY">Sledge-US-1996</LINK>) have enhanced day hospital care with respite or outreach services, it still remains unclear how day hospital care fits together with other types of community care, such as Assertive Community Treatment or home-based care.</P>
<P>In summary therefore, the decision to establish an acute day hospital must be made after careful consideration of local problems and resources. Acute day hospitals are an attractive option in situations where demand for inpatient care is high and facilities exist that are suitable for conversion. They are a less attractive option in situations where the demand for inpatient care is low and where effective alternatives are already in operation. The inclusion of a large, multicentre trial (<LINK REF="STD-Kallert_x002d_EU_x002d_2007" TYPE="STUDY">Kallert-EU-2007</LINK>) has reinforced the findings that day hospital care is as effective as inpatient care in treating acutely ill psychiatric patients.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">1. Methodological implications for research on acute day hospitals</HEADING>
<P>1.1 A multi-centre randomised controlled trial was called for in the previous version of this review. This clinical trial was performed and reinforces the results about feasibility, days in hospital and has provided unique data on quality of life and treatment satisfaction.</P>
<P>1.2 Although there is data on costs, and we are awaiting the translation of costs data for <LINK REF="STD-Kallert_x002d_EU_x002d_2007" TYPE="STUDY">Kallert-EU-2007</LINK>, it is likely that more new data on cost-effectiveness are needed.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">2. New directions for acute day hospital research</HEADING>
<P>2.1 It would be of interest to explore the relative cost effectiveness of the US and UK approaches to acute day hospital care (rapid discharge versus gradual discharge).</P>
<P>2.2 It would be interesting to examine why patients' psychiatric symptoms appear to recover more rapidly in day care (for example, does hospital admission actually worsen symptoms of depression or anxiety?).</P>
<P>2.3 It is important to examine how acute day hospital care can be most effectively integrated into a modern community based psychiatric service.</P>

<P>The search began by deriving a list of search terms from reading overviews of the field and consulting experts in day hospital care. The reference databases listed below were searched using Ovid Biomed.</P>
<P>1. CINAHL (January 1982 - December 2000) was searched using the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's search strategy for randomised controlled trials combined with the phrase: [((DAY adj2 HOSP*) or (DAY adj2 CARE) or (DAY adj2 TREATMENT*) or (DAY adj2 CENT*) or (DAY adj2 UNIT*) or (PARTIAL adj2 HOSP*) or (DISPENSARY)) AND MENTAL DISORDERS].</P>
<P>2. The Cochrane Library (Issue 4, 2000) was searched using the phrases: [((DAY near HOSP*) or (DAY near CARE) or (DAY near TREATMENT*) or (DAY near CENT*) or (DAY near UNIT*) or (PARTIAL near HOSP*) or (DISPENSARY)) AND MENTAL DISORDERS exploded].</P>
<P>3. EMBASE (January 1980 - December 2000) was searched using the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's search strategy for randomised controlled trials combined with the phrase: [((DAY adj2 HOSP*) or (DAY adj2 CARE) or (DAY adj2 TREATMENT*) or (DAY adj2 CENT*) or (DAY adj2 UNIT*) or (PARTIAL adj2 HOSP*) or (DISPENSARY)) AND MENTAL DISORDERS].</P>
<P>4. MEDLINE (January 1966 - December 2000) was searched using the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's search strategy for randomised controlled trials combined with the phrase: [((DAY adj2 HOSP*) or (DAY adj2 CARE) or (DAY adj2 TREATMENT*) or (DAY adj2 CENT*) or (DAY adj2 UNIT*) or (PARTIAL adj2 HOSP*) or (DISPENSARY)) AND MENTAL DISORDERS/All subheadings exploded].</P>
<P>5. PsycLIT (January 1967 - December 2000) was searched using the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's search strategy for randomised controlled trials combined with the phrase: [((DAY adj2 HOSP*) or (DAY adj2 CARE) or (DAY adj2 TREATMENT*) or (DAY adj2 CENT*) or (DAY adj2 UNIT*) or (PARTIAL adj2 HOSP*) or (DISPENSARY)) AND MENTAL DISORDERS].</P>

<TITLE MODIFIED="2010-12-01 10:40:16 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">Modifications to original protocol</TITLE>
<APPENDIX_BODY MODIFIED="2010-12-01 10:40:30 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>1. After writing the initial protocol it became obvious that it would be difficult to synthesis summary data from the included trials because of the range and complexity of the outcome variables that had been used. For example, one key outcome, use of hospital care, had been reported in terms of days in inpatient care, duration of day patient care, adjusted duration of day care (discounting weekends and days off), duration of index admission, nights out of hospital, actual attendances at day care, readmission to day care, readmission to inpatient care and so on. The result was that whilst most acute day hospital trials reported similar outcomes, these outcomes were rarely in the same format and hence could not be combined across trials. The picture was further complicated because many of the outcome variables were skewed, and tended to be presented in forms (such as medians) which cannot be readily synthesised in a meta analysis. It was therefore considered essential to obtain individual patient data from included trials so that the relevant outcomes could be presented in a common format.</P>
<P>2. The original protocol proposed to look at a number of different ways of using day hospitals, in addition to using them as an alternative to admission. This was too large a project to be contained in a single review, so alternative uses of day hospitals are covered in a separate review (<LINK REF="REF-Marshall-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marshall 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>3. The original protocol did not propose to look at feasibility of day hospital treatment. On reading the original papers and reviews it became clear that this was an important question that should be addressed by the review. Feasibility was therefore added to the list of outcomes.</P>
