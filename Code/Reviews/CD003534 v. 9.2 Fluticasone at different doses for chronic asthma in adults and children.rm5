I am not going to lose sleep over it but the new trials have been partially incorporated into the description of studies. What do you want to do?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am concerned about the abstract results, full results and discussion. FEV1 is primary outcome, so should be the main result in the abstract (only significant for 200 v 800). All PEF changes are pretty small so could be summarised by saying that statistically significant but small differences in PEF were found when higher dose FP was compared to lower dose?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the discussion the power is quite different for 400 v 200 and 400 v 100, hence the difference in significance. This, to me is the reason for the strange findings. I think I would tone down the idea about difference in clinical response from low to medium and medium to high as this is confounded by the number of pts studied. Please add the size of the FEV1 change in the early part of the discussion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-----------------------------------------------------&lt;br&gt;TJL: 050405 (44 studies, 63 references)&lt;br&gt;Dear Nick and Chris,&lt;br&gt;Please find attached the version of the FP dose response review that will be submitted at the end of May to issue 3, 2005 of the Cochrane Library.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chris - in recognition of all your support and guidance over the last few stages of the write-up of this review, with regard to NNTs and subgroup differences, I have taken the liberty of adding your name to the list of co-authors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following on from your email below, I have added some text in red. Can you both check this over and let me know what you think? To recap Nick, I came across an unpublished trial which reported flat data between 2 and 400mcg/d in moderate asthma in children, this had the net effect of hauling the moderate subgroup summary estimate back to the null, leaving the more estimate clear of the line of equivalence! When analysed with an excel spreadsheet designed to analyse between subgroup differences, and this led to a revision of some of the comments on the 4-500 versus 200mcg/d dose response. Text in Abstract, Discussion and conclusions - the general thrust is that there was a difference, but this is in one large trial in children, usual caveats about numbers, chance findings and more trials apply!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Best wishes,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Toby&lt;br&gt;----------------------------------------&lt;br&gt;CJC relook 020405&lt;br&gt;I am much happier with this current subgroup comments as they make better sense. I have used the Excel spreadsheet to generate a difference in PEF between moderate and more severe groups. Maybe this is part of the reason that Verona gives a different response as asthma was more severe. Do you want to reflect either of the above changes in the discussion. Otherwise this is ready to go on the module.&lt;br&gt;I have pondered the OR issue and when there are zero cells it is actually safer to use Risk Difference for the NNT so I have amended the Hoarseness results. I have not gone into great details in the text and will thrash this out with Julian when I get time.&lt;br&gt;Cheers,&lt;br&gt;Chris&lt;br&gt;============================================&lt;br&gt;Editing by CJC 31/3/2005 (RESPONSE BY TJL IN CAPS 010405):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Authors' Contribution: clear&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What's new: very helpful summary. I have run spell check on this. I have also pasted in the names of all the new studies. (THANKS)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Objectives: no change - fine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;References: fine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Table of included studies: fine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Metaview Labels :fine . I could only find one missed label on 3:22 which I have changed! (THANKS)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Synopsis : fine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abstract ; good. I have reported the fixed model result to match metaview for 200 v 4-500 morning PEF. (THANKS)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: unchanged&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: In outcome 3:23 what is going on in Peden 1998a - has the data been entered correctly for this trial, (also 3#27 Allen dysphonia data)? PLEASE CHECK THE PAPERS If these are wrong they will need putting right in comparisons 4,5 etc as well please. (ALL DATA ARE CORRECT - CANNOT REALLY ACCOUNT FOR APPARAENT DISCREPANCIES. PEDEN 1998 HAD FIVE TREATMENT ARMS - TWO DOSES WITH DISKUS AND ANOTHER TWO WITH DISKHALER (PLUS A DOUBLE DUMMY PLACEBO ARM).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a general difficulty in reporting because Nick entered lower dose FP in the first column making high dose the comparator which puts all the odds ratios around the wrong way for exacerbations, rather than change this I have qualified it in the description of the results. I have also taken out the &amp;quot;minus signs in favour of higher dose&amp;quot; for consistency. Please recheck the red text in the 200 v 400 results. Also the Chi-square is not significant between DPI and MDI for morning PEF. My calculation is that Chi = 14.31 -(10.6 + 1.87) = 1.84 on one degree of freedom this has p = .17! Next sentence about DPI being different has therefore been removed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I NEGELCTED TO UPDATE THE TEXT AFTER ADDING SAM DATA - I HAVE NOW REWORDED THIS IN RED (PLEASE SEE RESULTS SECTION) - SEVERITY IS NOW THE EXPLANATORY VARIABLE OF CHOICE!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have recalculated the NNTH using the low dose FP as the baseline risk and although the point estimates are the same the CI is much wider (I will have to think about why this might be!!!!). New Figure 1 and 2 as a consequence. THANKS CHRIS. I THOUGHT THAT ODDS WOULD GIVE IDENTICAL RESULTS IF THEY ARE RECIPROCAL!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Discussion&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Figures : I have amended the legend to the figures to describe numbers needed to save one case of candida etc (as shown in the picture).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Contentious issues: Why are verona and SAM so different in their results. Same duration and both in children??? YES - THEY ARE IDENTICAL EXCEPT THAT VERONA WAS IN MORE SEVERE ASTHMA, OH - AND ITS SIGNIFICANT FINDINGS FOUND ITS WAY INTO THE PUBLIC DOMAIN WHEREAS THE NON-SIGNIFICANT ONES OF THE SAM STUDY DID NOT.....&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I HAVE ALSO ADDED A LINE IN THE DISCUSSION REGARDING BONE TURNOVER.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spellchecked: done&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next action ; back to Toby to check red text. This is a huge job - well done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;=======================================================================&lt;br&gt;TJL 131204&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi Nick,&lt;br&gt;Hope all is well - I have attached the FP dose review - this is now complete. Can you check the that the text is OK and let me know? I can submit this to Chris and it should go through on the nod.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This wioll leave only the FP versus PLA review. That should be easy enough to sort out though as most of the data have been checked already. It will require some effort in slotting all the data in but this should bnot be too onerous a task.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Can you let me know if the FP/BDP review is ready to go to Chris for final approval? It should not take too long to process - much the same message as last time!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Best wishes,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Toby&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TJL 270204&lt;br&gt;Jan 04 search results - 110 references relating to FP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br&gt;16/10/2001&lt;br&gt;PAUL,&lt;br&gt;I HAVE LEFT THE SYNOPSIS TO YOU ON THIS ONE AND ASSUME AS A CO-AUTHOR THAT YOU WILL ENTER ANY APPROPRIATE CONFLICT OF INTEREST!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Text has been spell checked and all references to NO DIFFERENCE CHANGED TO NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE. ALL THE DATA HAS BEEN CHECKED AGAINST METAVIEW. THERE IS A PROBLEM WITH DIRECTIONS OF EFFECT WHICH ARE FAVOURING LOW DOSE IN METAVIEW AND HIGH DOSE IN THE TEXT. REENTRY OF ALL METAVIEW DATA IS UNTENABLE (IN MY VIEW), SO i HAVE CLARIFIED THE DIRECTION OF EFFECT IN THE TEXT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;2/10/2001 CJC&lt;br&gt;The Chevinsky data on physician effectiveness needs checking to see which way around it is!!*********&lt;br&gt;NEGATIVES REVERSED AND LABELS CHECKED&lt;br&gt;Comparison 11 #9, and 15 #10 looks like percentage figures so needs checking with other entries and relabelled as ineffective(check in original papers if poss) THIS HAS BEEN DONE BUT NOT CHECKED IN PAPERS.&lt;br&gt;Comp 20#2 discontinuation of oral steroids favours the higher dose of FP so has Nick reversed the figures here. NEED THE ORIGINAL PAPERS TO CHECK THIS OUT, WHICH I HAVE CHECKED AGAINST ABSTRACT AND NOW REVERSED.&lt;br&gt;Text now needs check to match the new Metaview figures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;24/7/01 TECHNICAL EDIT BY CJC&lt;br&gt;No co-reviewers are listed, so I have added Janine and Paul (is this ok?)&lt;br&gt;Comparison 4, 5 and 6 have funny labels of FP and Placebo, yet the header says 100 v 200 FP. Mistake I think. These need changing when the signs for Lung function get reversed.&lt;br&gt;The SD for Dahl is inconsistent between comparison 3 and 4 and the data needs to be checked on this. I HAVE DONE THIS FROM THE PAPER AND MADE IT CONSISTENT.&lt;br&gt;Comparison 19#11 looks as if it is percentages (paper needs checking here) AGAIN THIS HAS BEEN ALTERED ALONG WITH 3#16 AND 2#12.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Old title: #Inhaled fluticasone at different doses for chronic asthma in adults and children UPDATE (WITH CHRIS 230205)&lt;/p&gt;" NOTES_MODIFIED="2009-04-27 09:49:27 +0100" NOTES_MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson" REVIEW_NO="IFL1-AST" REVMAN_SUB_VERSION="5.0.18" REVMAN_VERSION="5" SPLIT_FROM="" STAGE="R" STATUS="A" TYPE="INTERVENTION" VERSION_NO="9.2">

<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Fluticasone (FP) is an inhaled corticosteroid commonly used to treat inflammation of the airways (passages to the lungs) and improve breathing in people with asthma. This review examined the effectiveness of FP when given at different doses for treating asthma in children and adults. High doses (800 to 1000 microgram per day) led to small improvements in measures of airway opening compared to low doses (50 to 100 microgram per day) in people with mild to moderate asthma. High dose FP did not lead to clear improvements in symptoms over the lower dose and increased the risk of a hoarse voice and fungal mouth infections. In people with severe asthma, very high doses FP (2000 microgram per day) appeared to allow more people on oral steroids to stop or reduce their dose of oral steroid tablets compared to lower doses of FP (1000 to 1500 microgram per day). </P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2009-04-27 09:48:42 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>Fifty-one published and unpublished trials (representing 55 group comparisons, 10,797 participants) met the inclusion criteria. In asthmatics with mild to moderate disease who were not on oral steroids, FP did not exhibit a dose-response effect in the lower dose comparisons in FEV1 (50mcg, 100mcg, 200mcg and 4-500mcg daily). There were no statistically significant differences between 4-500mcg and 800-1000mcg, and between 50-100 and 800-1000mcg of FP. When 200mcg was compared with 800-1000mcg daily FEV1 favoured the four/five fold increase. For PEF, a dose response was present with FP when low and moderate, and low and high doses of FP were compared. There was no evidence of a dose-response effect on symptoms or rescue beta-2 agonist use. The likelihood of hoarseness and oral candidiasis was significantly greater for the higher doses (800 to 1000 µg/day). People with oral steroid-dependent asthma treated with FP (2000 µg/day) were significantly more likely to reduce oral prednisolone than those on 1000 to 1500 µg/day (Peto odds Ratio 2.8, 95% CI 1.3 to 6.3). The highest dose also allowed a significant reduction in daily oral prednisolone dose compared to 1000 to 1500 µg/day (WMD 2.0 mg/day, 95% CI 0.1 to 4.0 mg/day).</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2008-08-06 15:55:21 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>We have not found evidence of a pronounced dose response in FEV1 with increasing doses of fluticasone. The number of studies contributing to our primary outcomes was low. At dose ratios of 1:2, there are statistically significant differences in favour of the higher dose in morning peak flow across the low dose range. The clinical impact of these differences is open to interpretation. Patients with moderate disease achieve similar levels of asthma control on medium doses of fluticasone (400 to 500 µg/day) as they do on high doses (800 to 1000 µg/day). More work in severe asthma would help to confirm that doses of FP above 500 µg/day confer greater benefit in this subgroup than doses of around 200 µg/day. In oral corticosteroid-dependent asthmatics, reductions in prednisolone requirement may be gained with FP 2000 µg/day.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-07-24 09:53:49 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>Fluticasone propionate (FP) is an anti-inflammatory inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) used for the treatment of childhood and adult asthma. It is licensed for use over a range of nominal daily doses and is widely used in the UK, Europe, Northern America and other areas of the world. Current asthma management guidelines produced by leading respiratory societies and organisations recommend a dose titration approach to the use of all ICSs, including FP (<LINK REF="REF-BTS-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">BTS 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-GINA-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">GINA 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NHLBI-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">NHLBI 1997</LINK>). For patients with persistent evidence of sub-optimal control as judged by frequency of symptoms, rescue bronchodilator requirement and measures of airway calibre (forced expiratory volume in one minute (FEV1), peak expiratory flow (PEF)) consideration should be given to increasing the daily dose of FP in the hope of achieving improved control. This recommendation is borne out of assuming a dose-response effect, in other words, that larger doses lead to improved measures of control. The best way of determining whether such an approach has a sound foundation is to undertake a trial in which patients are randomised to different doses of FP. The purpose of this review was, therefore, to evaluate all the available evidence from randomised trials that have compared FP at different nominal daily doses in order to assess whether a clinically relevant dose-response effect is present.</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>1. To assess the efficacy and safety outcomes in studies that compared inhaled FP at different nominal daily doses for the treatment of chronic asthma in adults and children. </P>
<P>2. To test for the presence of a dose-response effect. </P>

</CRIT_STUDIES>
<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>Studies including children and/or adults with a clinical diagnosis of chronic asthma were reviewed. Participants needed to be at least two years of age or older and have a diagnosis of chronic asthma. Diagnosis based on the physician opinion alone was acceptable, as well as asthma diagnosed using objective criteria related to asthma symptoms, airway reversibility, and all bronchial hyper-responsiveness. Treatment in the setting of primary care, hospital outpatients clinics, or institutional care was considered. </P>
</CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>Inhaled fluticasone at one nominal daily dose versus fluticasone (FP) at a second nominal daily dose. Treatment periods had to be for at least one week. Delivery of FP by a metered dose inhaler (MDI) or an MDI with a chamber or dry powder inhaler (DPI) was acceptable. Studies using nebulisers were specifically excluded. Patients receiving any two interventions were acceptable, including the use of oral corticosteroids (OCS). </P>

<P>A weighted treatment effect across trials was calculated using the Cochrane statistical package RevMan 5.

<P>A number of conditions were established a priori regarding the comparisons to be made, as follows:</P>
<OL>
<LI>Adult and paediatric lung function data reported as litres (i.e. FEV1 and PEF) were not combined due to the different lung volumes in these populations. Where data were presented on a % predicted scale which takes account of age, we combined paediatric and adult data. </LI>
<LI>Parallel and crossover trials were not pooled together.</LI>
<LI>Studies were categorised based on the presence or absence of regular oral corticosteroid (OCS) use at participant enrolment. It was expected that most trials with patients on regular oral steroids would use a steroid-sparing design in which daily dose of OCS was progressively reduced. In such studies the principal outcome variable is the dose of oral steroid needed to maintain asthma control. Conversely, studies in which patients were not treated with regular OCS would be more likely to have designs aimed at detecting improvements in asthma control. It would be inappropriate to combine trials with these different designs and aims</LI>

<SUBGROUP_ANALYSIS MODIFIED="2008-07-24 13:50:46 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>For each reported outcome, subgroup analyses have been undertaken. These are based on patient age (children or adults); treatment duration (one to four weeks, one to five months, six months or longer); delivery device (MDI or DPI); asthma severity (mild, mild-to-moderate, moderate). These analyses have been used to explore variations in treatment response according to these factors. In particular, for outcomes where heterogeneity exists between studies, subgroup analyses have been used to try to identify factors that may account for heterogeneity. These are discussed as appropriate in the following section.</P>

This may not be the sole reason for variation between the studies. Indeed, one area of uncertainty is the relative potency of FP using older propellants compared with the more recently developed CFC-free propellants. <LINK REF="STD-Lumry-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Lumry 2006</LINK> compared CFC-free (HFA) preparations of FP. While questions pertaining to the relative efficacy with CFC and HFA are not fully answered, there is a theoretical possibility that better deposition of the steroid particles in the small airways of the lungs enhances the potency of the drug. This would make FP more effective when propelled with HFA than older preparations of FP, especially in lower dose ranges.</P>

Both were large, high quality (Jadad score 3 or 4) multicentre trials in adults with severe asthma and conducted in the USA. An inclusion criterion for both studies was that participants were treated with, and dependent on, oral prednisolone for asthma control at the time of enrolment. Two nominal daily doses of FP were compared in each trial: FP 1000 µg/day or 2000 µg/day (<LINK REF="STD-Nelson-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Nelson 1999</LINK>) delivered via the Accuhaler DPI; and FP 1500 µg/day or 2000 µg/day delivered via MDI (<LINK REF="STD-Noonan-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Noonan 1995</LINK>). The mean daily baseline dose of oral prednisolone for the two studies was 13.0 to 13.6 mg/day and 9.5 to 10.2 mg/day respectively. In both studies a high proportion of patients (&gt; 80%) were also receiving treatment with regular inhaled corticosteroids (beclomethasone, triamcinolone or flunisolide) at enrolment, although this was not an inclusion criterion in either case. Reduction in daily dose of oral prednisolone was the primary outcome measure and both trials were of 16-weeks duration. Criteria for prednisolone dose reduction were established a priori and were based on maintenance of stable asthma control determined in relation to baseline control. This was assessed using changes in FEV1, PEF, rescue beta-2 agonist use and frequency of symptoms at clinic visits. Pooled with unpublished data (<LINK REF="STD-FLTA3022" TYPE="STUDY">FLTA3022</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-FLTA3022a" TYPE="STUDY">FLTA3022a</LINK>) there was no significant difference between the higher and lower dose of FP (FP 2000 µg/day compared with FP 1000 to 1500 µg/day) in terms of the number of participants who were able to stop OCS therapy (Peto OR 1.53, 95% CI 0.88 to 2.68).

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2008-08-06 16:01:19 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>We analysed data from 51 studies (yielding 55 randomised comparisons) with participants. The overall risk of bias from these trials was low. The purpose of the review was to test whether a dose-response effect is evident for fluticasone (FP), i.e. whether significantly greater improvements were present with higher as opposed to lower doses of FP. When asking such a question an important distinction needs to be made between statistically significant dose-dependent changes and those that are also of clinical significance. In a previous systematic review (<LINK REF="REF-Adams-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Adams 2008</LINK>) we assessed the efficacy and safety of FP when compared with placebo. That review was a quantitative synthesis of all the available randomised clinical trial evidence. Comparisons between active drug and placebo have the greatest likelihood of detecting clinically worthwhile improvements in asthma control and treatment-associated side effects. A significant proportion of the studies included in the current review included a placebo treatment arm and were also analysed in the previous review. As a result, the findings from that review can be considered as a benchmark whereby present findings can be better put into context. They are referred to in the following discussion, which considers dose response by outcome.</P>

<P>For dose comparisons over the lower-to-middle part of the dose range (FP 50 and 400 to 500 µg/day) no dose-response effect was apparent in people who had asthma and were not receiving oral steroids. In such people, these doses of FP have been shown to produce clinically significant improvements in FEV1 compared to placebo (0.31 to 0.41 litres) (<LINK REF="REF-Adams-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Adams 2008</LINK>). A statistically significant dose-response effect was apparent when comparing high doses (800 to 1000 µg/day) to the lower dose range (200 µg/day), although additional benefit with the high dose FP was relatively small (110 mls).</P>

In comparison with FP 100 µg/day, FP 200 µg/day led to small improvements in morning and evening PEF. Curiously, FP 400 to 500 µg/day was not superior to 100mcg/day but was when compared with 200 µg/day in adults. Given that the difference in both comparisons was not likely to be noticeable (2 and 8 litres for 100 and 200mcg respectively), this apparent discordant finding may be attributable to differential statistical power, or may be artefactual.</P>
<P>When moderate doses of FP were compared with higher doses the dose-response effect was less apparent overall. There was no significant difference between FP (400 to 500 µg/day) and FP (800 to 1000 µg/day) in morning PEF. These data suggest that there is a consistent dose response when doses of FP are increased in the lower dose ranges but at higher doses of FP (400 to 500 µg/day) the dose-dependent response became less apparent.</P>
<P>With a four to five-fold dose increase (200 and 800 to 1000 µg/day) a greater difference favouring the higher dose was seen for both morning and evening PEF. Similarly with a ten-fold plus increase in dose of FP (50 to 100 versus 800 to 1000 µg/day).</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Symptoms and rescue beta-2 agonist use</HEADING>
<P>Although all daily doses of FP led to significant improvements in symptoms scores when compared with placebo (<LINK REF="REF-Adams-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Adams 2008</LINK>), no dose response effect was apparent when making comparisons of individual doses across any part of the dose range. The same pattern of response was present for rescue beta-2 agonist requirement. All daily doses of FP led to significantly greater reductions in use compared to placebo (<LINK REF="REF-Adams-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Adams 2008</LINK>) but the dose relationship for FP was flat and there was no significant difference in benefit between high (1000 µg/day) and low dose (200 µg/day).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Health status</HEADING>
<P>Measures of health status were reported infrequently and did not cover the whole of the FP dose range. Where reported, however, no dose response was apparent. This included measures of child and parent well-being at doses over the lower part of the dose range, using disease specific instruments (<LINK REF="STD-Allen-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Allen 1998</LINK>) and comparisons over the lower and mid-dose range using general and disease specific instruments (<LINK REF="STD-Lumry-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Lumry 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pearlman-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Pearlman 1997</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Oropharyngeal side effects</HEADING>
<P>A significant dose-response effect was apparent for the likelihood of participants experiencing oral candidiasis. This was apparent when comparing high dose FP (1000 µg/day) with low dose FP (50 to 100 µg/day): the higher the dose the greater the risk. No significant difference in likelihood was seen when comparing doses in the lower part of the dose range. A similar picture was seen for risk of experiencing hoarseness. No dose-response effect was seen for likelihood of sore throat. This is consistent with the finding that an increased likelihood of sore throat was only apparent when the highest dose of FP was compared to placebo. Doses of 500 µg/day or less did not lead to an increased incidence of this side effect (<LINK REF="REF-Adams-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Adams 2008</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis function</HEADING>
<P>Measures of basal adrenal function (using morning plasma cortisol levels and 24-hour urinary cortisol excretion) and dynamic tests of adrenal reserve (post ACTH plasma cortisol levels) were reported in a number of studies. These studies covered most of the FP dose range and no differences were seen. However, non-randomised evidence does suggest that adrenal suppression has been documented as a serious side-effect of fluticasone (<LINK REF="REF-Tattersfield-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tattersfield 2004</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Clinical significance and generalisability of findings</HEADING>
<P>Children and adults treated with FP using a variety of dry powder and aerosol delivery devices were included in this review. Participants were treated for varying lengths of time, from four weeks up to one year. A notable feature of this analysis is that the addition of new studies increased heterogeneity in outcomes that had previously been homogeneous. This enabled us to revisit our a priori-defined subgroup analyses. Where sufficient data have been assembled, overall subgroup analyses have failed to identify groups who appeared to respond to treatment in a consistently different way. The findings appear to apply to children (over two years of age) and adults treated with all delivery devices (keeping in mind the use of nebulisers was excluded) for periods of one month up to a year. An important feature of the participants included in this analysis is that most appeared to have mild-to-moderate or moderate asthma, based on the current <LINK REF="REF-GINA-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">GINA 1995</LINK>/<LINK REF="REF-NHLBI-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">NHLBI 1997</LINK> criteria (using the baseline characteristics of the patients, listed in <LINK REF="TBL-05" TYPE="TABLE">Table 5</LINK>). It appears that, as a population, people with mild to moderate asthma who are not receiving oral corticosteroids do not experience any further gains in terms of symptom relief or needs for rescue beta-2 agonists when doses of FP are increased above 100 µg/day. However, people can be expected to gain some incremental improvements in measures of airway function on higher rather than lower daily doses. However, these additional improvements are small and it is difficult to judge whether they are clinically worthwhile.</P>
<P>Current UK guidelines recommend that adults and children with asthma should be prescribed low-dose steroids if their symptoms are severe enough to warrant initiation of preventative therapy. Subsequently, if they are inadequately controlled on low-dose steroids, a trial of additive therapy, such as long-acting beta agonists, is recommended (<LINK REF="REF-BTS-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">BTS 2003</LINK>), although use of LABA as a monotherapy does carry risks (<LINK REF="REF-Cates-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cates 2008</LINK>). This is based on the assumption that dose-dependent improvements in asthma control (symptoms, exacerbations, rescue beta-2 agonist use, PEF variability) can be achieved. The findings of this review provided evidence to support this approach. However, it also suggests that most people with mild to moderate asthma achieve similar levels of control, certainly in terms of symptom relief and bronchodilator requirements, in the lower part of the dose range for fluticasone as they do when up to five-fold increases in daily doses are prescribed. The use of high-dose FP was accompanied by an increased risk of oral side effects. This needs to be borne in mind when advising patients about possible side effects and when choosing a prescribed dose.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Oral steroid-treated asthma</HEADING>
<P>High-dose FP was effective in allowing people who were dependent on oral steroids and receiving inhaled steroids to reduce or stop the use of prednisolone (<LINK REF="REF-Adams-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Adams 2008</LINK>). In this group of patients, a dose-response effect was apparent for likelihood of both stopping prednisolone completely and reducing the daily dose. Very high dose FP (2000 µg/day) led to significantly greater improvements in these outcomes compared to FP (1000 to 1500 µg/day). A NNT of 6 (95% CI 3 to 25) implied that only six patients needed to be treated at the higher daily dose over 16 weeks to allow an extra patient to stop prednisolone completely compared to those treated with FP 1000 to 1500 µg/day. The highest dose of FP also allowed an additional 2 mg/day (95% CI 0.1 to 4.0 mg/day) reduction in prednisolone dose compared to FP 1000 to 1500 µg/day, in people with a baseline prednisolone use of between 9 and 14 mg/day. Such improvements may be beneficial. An interesting finding of this analysis was that a clear dose-response effect over this range was also apparent in terms of improvement in FEV1, morning PEF, evening PEF and daily asthma symptom score. In fact, the additional improvements seen for the highest dose of FP, compared to 1000 to 1500 µg/day, for these patients were substantially greater than those seen in mild to moderately severe asthmatics over a 10-fold plus increase in dose (FP 100 and FP 800 to 1000 µg/day). The explanation for this difference may lie in the fact that people with severe asthma had a greater scope for improvement in these measures, as judged by their significantly impaired baseline lung function (<LINK REF="TBL-05" TYPE="TABLE">Table 5</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Methodological limitations</HEADING>
<P>The search for trials covered a large volume of literature but it is possible that relevant, published trials were missed. However, Glaxo Smith Kline (GSK) who have the sole licence for the manufacture of fluticasone (Flixotide) and who have sponsored many of the trials included in this review only alerted us to one further study, published after the date of the last electronic search. This provided a degree of reassurance that the search strategy was effective and that no further studies were missed.</P>
<P>Many trials included in this review were conducted with the objective of assessing whether FP exhibits a dose-response effect. In this context, failure to detect dose differences could be interpreted as a negative finding. It is possible that relevant, negative trials exist but have not been published. Failure to include such studies could lead to a biased over-estimate of dose differences. However, this possibility seems unlikely as authors who are experts in the area and GSK did not alert us to such studies.</P>
<P>This review does not include data on bone turnover. Given the concerns raised about the short and long-term side-effect profile of steroids (<LINK REF="REF-BTS-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">BTS 2003</LINK>), maintaining patients on the lowest possible dose is recommended in order to minimise the risk of potential adverse events without compromising asthma control.</P>
<P>Studies including infants under the age of two years were specifically excluded. The diagnosis of asthma and administration of inhaled medication are especially difficult in this group of patients, so the findings of this review should not be extrapolated to this group.</P>
<P>FP has been licensed for use in the UK in the form of a nebulised solution. Trials using nebulisers were specifically excluded from this review and the findings from this review should not be extrapolated to the use of fluticasone using a nebuliser.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2008-08-06 15:55:03 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>Inhaled fluticasone (FP) is an effective treatment for chronic asthma when administered over a wide range of daily doses. Although a shallow dose-response effect is evident for a number of measures of asthma control where oral steroids are not given, the findings of this review would suggest that most children and adults with mild to moderate asthma do not achieve clinically worthwhile improvements in FEV1 with higher doses (more than 500 µg/day) as compared to lower doses (up to 200 µg/day). Small increases in peak flow have been shown with higher doses of FP, but although these are statistically significant they may not be large enough to be clinically important. Severe, oral steroid-dependent asthmatics gain clinically worthwhile benefit in terms of oral steroid cessation and reduction in daily dose of prednisolone on very high doses of FP (2000 µg/day). People who cannot be weaned off oral steroids using lower doses should have a trial of FP 2000 µg/day.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>A large number of people have been studied in the assessment of the relative efficacy of fluticasone (FP) at different doses. Clinically-relevant outcome measures related to airway calibre and symptoms have been assessed in both children and adults. However, a number of possible avenues of further research can be identified. Heath status (patient-centred evaluation of the impact of asthma on functional state) has been reported infrequently and has not been assessed over the whole of the available dose range. There is a place for further studies over the available dose range using disease-specific instruments and where clinically meaningful change scores can be established. Other important outcomes have not been assessed. These include those that have health economic significance, including hospital and primary care physician attendance rates due to clinical asthma exacerbations that necessitate additional treatment or hospital admission. Longer-term studies (six months or greater) would be needed to reliably assess these outcomes. Such trials are likely to be difficult to set up and very expensive. </P>
<P>The identified upper limits of the dose-response effect require some confirmatory work. In particular, the assessment of FP at doses between 400 to 500 µg/day compared with a two-fold increase in children and in more severe asthma would help to extend the validity of the evidence. In the present review the trial populations were predominantly adult populations with moderately severe asthma. </P>
<P>The long-term effects of different doses of FP on HPA axis and any associated risk of adrenal insufficiency are unknown. Studies that assess these risks will need to include patients treated for a number of years and will need to include many patients in order to have adequate power of detecting differences because such events are likely to be rare. Prospective RCTs will almost certainly be unable to answer these questions due to limitations of cost. Well-conducted retrospective cohort studies will probably be the only way to evaluate the differential risk, if any, of different doses of FP in terms of clinically meaningful disturbances to HPA function. </P>

<P>We have opted against pooling data from studies in adults and children where outcomes are reported as litres (such as FEV1 and PEF). Heterogeneity in lung function outcomes such as FEV1 and PEF, are likely to be explained by differences in lung volume between these age groups since lower lung volumes in children may naturally yield results to those given by adults. However where metrics convert litres to percent predicted, and take into account age (as well as height and gender) we have retained combined estimates for adult and paediatric studies. </P>

<TD>
<P>Initial version of the review (All Years searching to March 1999): 6494 citations retrieved, 2162 unique citations imported to Inhaled Steroid Register. From this a fluticasone register was created consisting of 258 citations. 180 excluded on basis of abstract: 150 not RCT; 30 not chronic asthma in humans; 78 papers retrieved in full text form; 57 excluded on basis of full paper: 6 not RCT; 1 infants; 3 delivery device comparison; 1 treatment period &lt; 1 week; 46 not a comparison of 2 or more doses of FP; 21 publications meeting inclusion criteria; 16 unique studies meeting inclusion criteria<BR/>
<BR/>One study (Raphael 1999) was identified by Glaxo Wellcome. This study was published after the date of the final electronic search (March 1999). Three studies (Boner 1999, Hofstra 2000, Ind 2003) were identified as a result of searching respiratory society meeting abstracts.</P>

<P>Update (March 1999-January 2005)</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>From hand searching the updated inhaled steroids search results (additional 1301 references), a 'fluticasone' register was created consisting of 196 citations (121 references excluded from abstracts as irrelevant comparisons). Forty-six references pertaining to 34 studies were retrieved in full for this review. One study reported findings from two data-sets and these studies have been given two identifiers (Sorkness 1999; Sorkness 1999a). We excluded 11 studies for the following reasons: Wrong comparator (9), outcomes not relevant (2) and varying dose of FP (1).<BR/>
<BR/>24 new studies met the inclusion criteria for the review (Allen 2000; Bukovskis 2002; Casale 2001; Chetta 2002; Derom 1999; Derom 2001; Falcoz 2000; Gershman 2000; Giannini 2003; Kemp 2004; Li 1999; Meijer 1999; Nathan 2000; Nielsen 2002; Nieto 2001; O'Sullivan 2002; Pauwels 2002; Pearlman 1999; Pearlman 2002; SAM40012; Sorkness 1999; Sorkness 1999a; Verona 2003; Wallin 2003).<BR/>
<BR/>Data for two studies previously included as abstracts were published in full text form (Hofstra 2000; Ind 2003). One study was identified from an online repository of unpublished clinical trials (SAM40012).</P>

<P>Impact of new evidence on findings of the review<BR/>The addition of new data on the review has largely increased the precision of the effect estimates. The existence of a small dose response in the lower dose ranges of fluticasone (FP) has not been challenged by the new trials included in the review. The inclusion of data from three studies comparing FP at doses of 400 to 500 µg/day with 800 to 1000 µg/day raises the possibility that the upper limits of the dose response occur at medium doses for adults with moderate asthma. Evidence from one trial suggested that the response to higher doses of FP is greater in more severe asthma. Further work would help to confirm this.<BR/>
<BR/>Detail of update - latest search date January 2005<BR/>A total of 23 new trials, contributing data for an additional 2370 participants met the inclusion criteria of the review (Allen 2000; Bukovskis 2002; Casale 2001; Chetta 2002; Derom 1999; Derom 2001; Falcoz 2000; Gershman 2000; Giannini 2003; Kemp 2004; Li 1999; Meijer 1999; Nathan 2000; Nielsen 2002; Nieto 2001; O'Sullivan 2002; Pauwels 2002; Pearlman 1999; Pearlman 2002; SAM40012; Sorkness 1999; Sorkness 1999a; Verona 2003; Wallin 2003). The latest search date was January 2004.<BR/>
<BR/>Data from the full publications of studies previously available as abstracts were included (Ind 1998 (now Ind 2003); Hofstra 1998 (now Hofstra 2000)). Several trials contributed to more than one comparison as they were multi-arm studies. One unpublished trial was identified (SAM40012).<BR/>
<BR/>Unless otherwise indicated, the addition of new data tightened confidence intervals around existing significant or non-significant pooled estimates. In the following summary of outcomes for different dose comparisons, outcomes marked * denote those that became significant with the addition of new data.<BR/>
<BR/>Fluticasone 100 versus 200 µg/day (4 new studies)<BR/>Change in forced expiratory volume in one minute (FEV1); change in morning peak expiratory flow (PEF); change in evening PEF; change in daily use of rescue medication; change in daily asthma symptoms; change in number of nocturnal awakenings*; withdrawal due to lack of efficacy; sore throat or pharyngitis<BR/>
<BR/>Fluticasone 100 versus 400 to 500 µg/day (2 new studies)<BR/>Change in FEV1; change in morning PEF; change in daily symptoms<BR/>
<BR/>Fluticasone 200 versus 400 to 500 µg/day (9 new studies)<BR/>Change in morning PEF; change in evening PEF; change in FEV1; change in daily symptoms; change in rescue medication usage; number of nocturnal awakenings; number of patients withdrawn due to lack of efficacy; sore throat or pharyngitis; hoarseness or dysphonia; oral candidiasis<BR/>
<BR/>Fluticasone 400 to 500 versus 800 to 1000 µg/day (3 new studies, no studies previously included)<BR/>Change in morning PEF; change in FEV1; exacerbations requiring oral corticosteroids (OCS); withdrawals<BR/>
<BR/>Fluticasone 50 to 100 versus 800 to 1000 µg/day (2 new studies)<BR/>FEV1<BR/>
<BR/>Fluticasone 200 versus 800 to 1000 µg/day (4 new studies)<BR/>Change in FEV1; change in morning PEF; sore throat or pharyngitis; oral candidiasis* (fewer instances of candidiasis in lower dose group); withdrawals due to lack of efficacy, hoarseness or dysphonia<BR/>

<APPENDIX_BODY MODIFIED="2008-07-24 13:44:09 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>Two authors (NPA and JB) were blinded to the authors' names, institutions and funding sources and independently assessed the methodological quality of included studies. Trials were scored using the following approach.</P>
<P>Grade A: adequate allocation concealment.<BR/>Grade B: unclear allocation concealment.<BR/>Grade C: clearly inadequate concealment.</P>
<P>Studies were also assessed using a five-point scoring instrument (Jadad 1996).<BR/>1. Was the study described as randomised? (yes = 1, no = 0).<BR/>2. Was the study described as double blind? (yes = 1, no = 0).<BR/>3. Was there a description of withdrawals and dropouts? (yes = 1, no = 0).<BR/>4. Was the method of randomisation well described and appropriate? (yes = 1, no = 0).<BR/>5. Was the method of double blinding well described and appropriate? (yes = 1, no = 0).<BR/>6. Deduct one point if method of randomisation or blinding inappropriate.<BR/>Inter-rater agreement was measured using the kappa statistic. Disagreement was resolved by consensus.</P>

<P>The procedures for randomising GSK sponsored studies has been detailed in correspondence between Richard Follows and TL, the details of which are given below:</P>
<P>The randomisation software is a computer-generated, centralised programme (RandAll). After verification that the randomisation sequence is suitable for the study design (crossover, block or stratification), Clinical Supplies then package the treatments according to the randomisation list generated. Concealment of allocation is maintained by a third party, since the sites phone in and are allocated treatments on that basis. Alternatively a third party may dispense the drug at the sites. Unblinding of data for interim analyses can only be done through RandAll, and are restricted so that only those reviewing the data are unblinded to treatment group allocation.</P>
