<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2015-05-18 12:23:42 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Intestinal worms (helminths) contribute to iron-deficiency anaemia as they feed on blood and cause further bleeding by releasing anticoagulant compounds. They also affect the supply of nutrients and cause anorexia, vomiting and diarrhoea. Pregnancy complicated by maternal hookworm infection poses a serious threat to the health of mothers and their babies, especially in developing countries. Women who are anaemic during pregnancy are more likely to have ill health, give birth prematurely, and have low birthweight babies with low iron reserves. Antihelminthic drugs are highly effective and have minimal side-effects but information on their use during pregnancy is limited. The major concern is that the drugs may cause malformation of the fetus (teratogenic effects). We examined the research published up to 31 January 2015 on the impact of giving a single antihelminthic treatment in the second trimester of pregnancy on maternal anaemia and pregnancy outcomes.</P>
<P>We found four studies including 4265 pregnant women. Two of the included studies were of high quality, while the other two were of relatively low quality with limitations and biases in design and conduct. The studies were conducted in Sierra Leone, Peru and Uganda. In two studies, the women were also given a daily iron or iron-folate supplement along with antihelminthic treatment. There was no effect of antihelminthic administered in second trimester of pregnancy on maternal anaemia, low birthweight, preterm births or perinatal deaths. There was no impact on maternal anaemia in studies in which iron or iron-folate was also given to pregnant women along with antihelminthic. The impact on infant survival at six months of age could not be evaluated because data were not available. Evidence provided so far from randomised controlled trials is, therefore, insufficient to recommend use of antihelminthics for pregnant women after the first trimester of pregnancy.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2015-05-18 13:10:57 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Helminthiasis is infestation of the human body with parasitic worms and it is estimated to affect 44 million pregnancies, globally, each year. Intestinal helminthiasis (hook worm) is associated with blood loss and decreased supply of nutrients for erythropoiesis, resulting in iron-deficiency anaemia. Over 50% of the pregnant women in low- and middle-income countries suffer from iron-deficiency anaemia. Though iron-deficiency anaemia is multifactorial, hook worm infestation is a major contributory cause in women of reproductive age in endemic areas. Antihelminthics are highly efficacious in treating hook worm but evidence of their beneficial effect and safety, when given during pregnancy, has not been established.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2015-06-18 10:51:02 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Leanne V Jones">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2015-06-10 16:43:15 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>Helminthiasis is infestation of the human body with parasitic worms. There are about 20 major helminth infections of humans, and all have some public health significance, but among the commonest of all human infections are the geo-helminthiasis (soil-transmitted) (<LINK REF="REF-Warren-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Warren 1993</LINK>). Global estimates indicate that more than a quarter of the world's population is infected with one or more of the most common of these parasites: roundworms (<I>Ascaris lumbricoides)</I>; hookworms (<I>Necator americanus </I>and <I>Ancylostoma duodenale)</I>; and whipworm (<I>Trichuris trichura</I>) (<LINK REF="REF-Chan-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chan 1994</LINK>). Infection with <I>Trichuris trichura</I> and <I>Ascaris lumbricoides </I>typically reaches maximum intensity at five to 10 years of age, after which it declines to a lower level that persists throughout adulthood. A different profile is apparent for hookworm infections, with maximum intensity not usually attained until 20 to 25 years (<LINK REF="REF-Stephenson-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stephenson 1987</LINK>).</P>
<P>Intestinal helminths contribute to anaemia as they feed on blood and cause further haemorrhage by releasing anticoagulant compounds, thereby leading to iron-deficiency anaemia. They also contribute by affecting the supply of nutrients necessary for erythropoiesis (<LINK REF="REF-Hotez-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hotez 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Torlesse-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Torlesse 2000</LINK>). Although iron-deficiency anaemia is multifactorial, hookworm infection is an important contributory factor in endemic areas, especially among women of reproductive age. It is the leading cause of pathological blood loss in tropical and subtropical regions (<LINK REF="REF-Pawlowski-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pawlowski 1991</LINK>). Globally, an estimated 44 million pregnancies a year are complicated by maternal hookworm infection alone, posing a serious threat to the health of mothers and fetuses (<LINK REF="REF-Bundy-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bundy 1995</LINK>). Women in low- and middle-income countries may be pregnant or lactating for as much as half of their reproductive lives (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1994</LINK>) and estimates indicate that over 50% of the pregnant women have iron-deficiency anaemia (<LINK REF="REF-ACC_x002f_SCN-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">ACC/SCN 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1997</LINK>).<I> Trichuris trichura </I>also causes intestinal blood loss, although much less so than hookworms on a per-worm basis (<LINK REF="REF-Bundy-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bundy 1989</LINK>). <I>Ascaris lumbricoides </I>interferes with the utilisation of vitamin A, which is required for haematopoiesis. All three intestinal helminths may reduce the intake and absorption of iron and other haematopoietic nutrients by causing anorexia, vomiting and diarrhoea (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2003</LINK>). A study on pregnant women in Liberia found the intensity of hookworm infection, as estimated by faecal egg counts, to be negatively associated with haemoglobin concentration (<LINK REF="REF-Jackson-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jackson 1987</LINK>). Anaemia during pregnancy is associated with premature delivery, low birthweight, maternal ill health, and maternal death (<LINK REF="REF-Seshadri-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Seshadri 1997</LINK>). Favourable pregnancy outcomes occur 30% to 45% less often in anaemic mothers, and their infants have less than one half of normal iron reserves. Iron deficiency also adversely affects cognitive performance and development as well as the physical growth of these infants (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2001</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2015-06-10 16:36:24 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>Antihelminthic treatment is regarded as the most effective means of controlling mortality and morbidity due to intestinal helminth infections (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1994</LINK>). Antihelminthics such as levamisole, mebendazole, albendazole and pyrantel are highly efficacious and have minimal side-effects but data about their use in pregnancy are extremely limited. Few endemic countries have incorporated control of hookworm infections into routine antenatal care. The major obstacles to routine antihelminthic treatment in pregnancy include concerns that the drugs may have teratogenic effects on the fetus, as well as the lack of evidence supporting the health benefits of treating during pregnancy on pregnancy outcome. In 1994, the World Health Organization (WHO) convened an informal consultation on hookworm infection and anaemia in girls and women, which promoted the use of antihelminthics in pregnancy after the first trimester in areas where these infections are endemic (prevalence &gt; 20% to 30%) and where anaemia is prevalent, but it also recommended evaluation of the long-term safety, particularly in terms of birth outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1994</LINK>). A cross-sectional retrospective study in Sri Lanka in 1995, assessing the effect of mebendazole during pregnancy on birth outcome, found beneficial effects of the therapy on birth outcome, with significantly lower rates of stillbirths, perinatal deaths and very low birthweight babies in the mebendazole group than in the control group. A slightly higher rate of congenital defects was found in women who had taken the drug in the first trimester of pregnancy but the difference was non-significant (<LINK REF="REF-de-Silva-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">de Silva 1999</LINK>). Another non-randomised effectiveness study also conducted in Sri Lanka (<LINK REF="REF-Atukorala-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Atukorala 1994</LINK>) involved iron folate supplementation along with a single dose of mebendazole in the second trimester of pregnancy. Comparison of compliants versus non-compliants of the therapy showed an improvement in the iron status of pregnant women in the iron folate mebendazole group. An Indian community-based pre-post experimental study (<LINK REF="REF-Abel-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Abel 2000</LINK>) demonstrated a significant decrease in the prevalence of anaemia and increased mean haemoglobin in both second and third trimester in the group receiving education focusing on anaemia, plus iron supplementation and 100 mg mebendazole taken twice daily for three days. Similar results were found in a non-randomised community-based study in Nepal (<LINK REF="REF-Christian-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Christian 2004</LINK>), which showed an increase in haemoglobin levels and a lower proportion of anaemia in third trimester in women receiving albendazole in the second trimester.</P>
<P>The WHO recommends administration of praziquantel and albendazole or mebendazole, administered together for schistosomiasis and soil-transmitted helminthiasis to pregnant women in second and third trimester and lactating women at high risk in certain occupations (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2006</LINK>). Women can be treated with praziquantel for schistosomiasis at any stage of pregnancy and during lactation (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2006</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2015-06-10 16:43:49 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>Measures to prevent and treat helminth infections aim to alleviate suffering, reduce poverty, and support equal opportunities for men and women (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2006</LINK>). Since many of the antihelminthic drugs are broad spectrum, treatment can results in targeting several diseases simultaneously. Preventive chemotherapy (either alone or in combination) is used as a public heath tool for preventing morbidity due to infection usually with more than one helminth at a time.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2015-06-18 10:51:02 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Leanne V Jones">
<P>A systematic review of randomised controlled trials on the effect of administration of intestinal antihelminthic drugs showed a mean difference of 1.71 g/L (95% confidence interval 0.70 to 2.73) for a change in haemoglobin level, however, this analysis included data from trials conducted in women, both pregnant and non-pregnant, and children (<LINK REF="REF-Gulani-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gulani 2008</LINK>). Very little is currently known about the effects antihelminthics on birth outcome (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2006</LINK>). Hence the aim of this review is to identify the effects of administering antihelminthics during pregnancy and to evaluate the effect on maternal and pregnancy outcome.</P>

Any disagreement was resolved by discussion or by involving a third assessor.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(1) Random sequence generation (checking for possible selection bias)</HEADING>
<P>We described for each included study the method used to generate the allocation sequence in sufficient detail to allow an assessment of whether it should produce comparable groups.</P>
<P>We assessed the method as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>low risk of bias (any truly random process, e.g. random number table; computer random number generator);</LI>
<LI>high risk of bias (any non-random process, e.g. odd or even date of birth; hospital or clinic record number);</LI>
<LI>unclear risk of bias.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(2) Allocation concealment (checking for possible selection bias)</HEADING>
<P>We described for each included study the method used to conceal allocation to interventions prior to assignment and assessed whether intervention allocation could have been foreseen in advance of, or during recruitment, or changed after assignment.</P>
<P>We assessed the methods as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>low risk of bias (e.g. telephone or central randomisation; consecutively numbered sealed opaque envelopes);</LI>
<LI>high risk of bias (open random allocation; unsealed or non-opaque envelopes, alternation; date of birth);</LI>
<LI>unclear risk of bias.</LI>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">(3.1) Blinding of participants and personnel (checking for possible performance bias)</HEADING>
<P>We described for each included study the methods used, if any, to blind study participants and personnel from knowledge of which intervention a participant received. We considered that studies were at low risk of bias if they were blinded, or if we judged that the lack of blinding unlikely to affect results. We assessed blinding separately for different outcomes or classes of outcomes.</P>
<P>We assessed the methods as:</P>
<UL>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">(4) Incomplete outcome data (checking for possible attrition bias due to the amount, nature and handling of incomplete outcome data)</HEADING>
<P>We described for each included study, and for each outcome or class of outcomes, the completeness of data including attrition and exclusions from the analysis. We stated whether attrition and exclusions were reported and the numbers included in the analysis at each stage (compared with the total randomised participants), reasons for attrition or exclusion where reported, and whether missing data were balanced across groups or were related to outcomes. Where sufficient information was reported, or could be supplied by the trial authors, we planned to re-include missing data in the analyses which we undertook.</P>
<P>We assessed methods as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>low risk of bias (e.g. no missing outcome data; missing outcome data balanced across groups);</LI>
<LI>high risk of bias (e.g. numbers or reasons for missing data imbalanced across groups; &#8216;as treated&#8217; analysis done with substantial departure of intervention received from that assigned at randomisation);</LI>
<LI>unclear risk of bias.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(5) Selective reporting (checking for reporting bias)</HEADING>
<P>We described for each included study how we investigated the possibility of selective outcome reporting bias and what we found.</P>
<P>We assessed the methods as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>low risk of bias (where it is clear that all of the study&#8217;s pre-specified outcomes and all expected outcomes of interest to the review have been reported);</LI>
<LI>high risk of bias (where not all the study&#8217;s pre-specified outcomes have been reported; one or more reported primary outcomes were not pre-specified; outcomes of interest are reported incompletely and so cannot be used; study fails to include results of a key outcome that would have been expected to have been reported);</LI>

<P>We described for each included study any important concerns we had about other possible sources of bias.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(7) Overall risk of bias</HEADING>
<P>We made explicit judgements about whether studies were at high risk of bias, according to the criteria given in the <I>Handbook</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). With reference to (1) to (6) above, we planned to assess the likely magnitude and direction of the bias and whether we considered it is likely to impact on the findings.

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Assessment of the quality of the evidence</HEADING>
<P>For this update the quality of the evidence was assessed using the GRADE approach (<LINK REF="REF-Schunemann-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schunemann 2009</LINK>) in order to assess the quality of the body of evidence relating to the following outcomes for the main comparison (antihelminthics versus control<I>).</I>
</P>
<OL>
<LI>Maternal anaemia in third trimester (&lt; 11 g/dL)</LI>
<LI>Low birthweight (less than 2500 g)</LI>
<LI>Perinatal mortality</LI>
<LI>Preterm birth (birth before 37 weeks of gestation)</LI>
</OL>
<P>We used the GRADE profiler (<LINK REF="REF-GRADEpro-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">GRADEpro 2014</LINK>) to import data from Review Manager 5.3 (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2014</LINK>) in order to create a &#8217;Summary of findings&#8217; table. A summary of the intervention effect and a measure of quality for each of the above outcomes was produced using the GRADE approach. The GRADE approach uses five considerations (study limitations, consistency of effect, imprecision, indirectness and publication bias) to assess the quality of the body of evidence for each outcome. The evidence can be downgraded from 'high quality' by one level for serious (or by two levels for very serious) limitations, depending on assessments for risk of bias, indirectness of evidence, serious inconsistency, imprecision of effect estimates or potential publication bias.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Cluster-randomised trials</HEADING>
<P>We did not identify any cluster trials for inclusion. In future updates, if identified and eligible for inclusion, we will include cluster-randomised trials in the analyses along with individually-randomised trials. We will adjust their sample sizes or standard errors using the methods described in the <I>Handbook</I> using an estimate of the intracluster correlation co-efficient (ICC) derived from the trial (if possible), from a similar trial or from a study of a similar population. If we use ICCs from other sources, we will report this and conduct sensitivity analyses to investigate the effect of variation in the ICC. If we identify both cluster-randomised trials and individually-randomised trials, we plan to synthesise the relevant information. We will consider it reasonable to combine the results from both if there is little heterogeneity between the study designs and the interaction between the effect of intervention and the choice of randomisation unit is considered to be unlikely.</P>
<P>We will also acknowledge heterogeneity in the randomisation unit and perform a sensitivity analysis to investigate the effects of the randomisation unit.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Cross-over trials</HEADING>
<P>It is unlikely that cross-over designs will be a valid study design for Pregnancy and Childbirth reviews, and so are expected to be excluded.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Studies with more than two intervention groups</HEADING>
<P>In instances where the included studies had more than two intervention groups, we combined the groups to create a single pair-wise comparison. For <LINK REF="STD-Ndyomugyenyi-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Ndyomugyenyi 2008</LINK>, we combined the three intervention groups (ivermectin; albendazole; and ivermectin-albendazole) and compared it with the reference control group to create a single pair-wise comparison. Similarly, for <LINK REF="STD-Elliott-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Elliott 2005</LINK>, we merged the three intervention group groups (albendazole/placebo; praziquantel/placebo; and albendazole/praziquantel) and compared it with the placebo/placebo group to create a single pair-wise comparison.</P>

<MISSING_DATA MODIFIED="2014-11-17 11:02:41 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>For included studies, levels of attrition were noted. In future updates, if more eligible studies are included, the impact of including studies with high levels of missing data in the overall assessment of treatment effect will be explored by using sensitivity analysis.</P>
<P>For all outcomes, analyses were carried out, as far as possible, on an intention-to-treat basis i.e. we attempted to include all participants randomised to each group in the analyses. The denominator for each outcome in each trial was the number randomised minus any participants whose outcomes were known to be missing.</P>

<HETEROGENEITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2015-06-10 16:39:25 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>We assessed statistical heterogeneity in each meta-analysis using the Tau, I and Chi statistics. We regarded heterogeneity as substantial if an I was greater than 30% and either the Tau was greater than zero, or there was a low P value (less than 0.10) in the Chi test for heterogeneity. Had we identified substantial heterogeneity (above 30%), we planned to explore it by pre-specified subgroup analysis. </P>

<P>In future updates, if there are 10 or more studies in the meta-analysis, we will investigate reporting biases (such as publication bias) using funnel plots. We will assess funnel plot asymmetry visually. If asymmetry is suggested by a visual assessment, we will perform exploratory analyses to investigate it.</P>
</BIAS_ASSESSMENT>
<DATA_SYNTHESIS MODIFIED="2015-06-10 16:39:32 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>We carried out statistical analysis using the Review Manager software (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2014</LINK>). We used fixed-effect meta-analysis for combining data where it was reasonable to assume that studies were estimating the same underlying treatment effect: i.e. where trials were examining the same intervention, and the trials&#8217; populations and methods were judged sufficiently similar.</P>
<P>If there was clinical heterogeneity sufficient to expect that the underlying treatment effects differed between trials, or if substantial statistical heterogeneity was detected, we used random-effects meta-analysis to produce an overall summary, if an average treatment effect across trials was considered clinically meaningful. The random-effects summary was treated as the average range of possible treatment effects and we discussed the clinical implications of treatment effects differing between trials. If the average treatment effect was not clinically meaningful, we did not combine trials. Where we used random-effects analyses, the results were presented as the average treatment effect with 95% CIs, and the estimates of Tau and I.</P>

<P>The trial conducted in Sierra Leone (<LINK REF="STD-Torlesse-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Torlesse 2001</LINK>) was a randomised controlled 2 x 2 factorial design. It included 184 pregnant women with a haemoglobin (Hb) concentration &gt; 80 g/L and gestational age &lt; 14 weeks at baseline. The intervention began at the first antenatal visit in the second trimester and included one single dose of albendazole (2 x 200 mg) and daily iron-folate supplements (36 mg iron as ferrous gluconate and 5 mg folic acid) for the entire duration of pregnancy. Women were assigned to one of four intervention groups; one group received daily iron-folate supplements and albendazole, the second group received daily iron-folate supplements and placebo albendazole, the third group received albendazole and placebo daily iron-folate supplements and the fourth group received placebos only. Both the groups were statistically similar at baseline in terms of demographic, social and reproductive characteristics. The frequency of intestinal helminths at baseline was: <I>Ascaris lumbricoides</I> 20%, <I>Necator americanus</I> 65.6%, and <I>Trichuris trichura</I> 74.4%, and anaemia (Hb &lt; 110 g/L) was found in 56% of the women and iron-deficiency anaemia in 18.4% of women.<BR/>
<BR/>The study conducted in Peru (<LINK REF="STD-Larocque-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Larocque 2006</LINK>) included 1042 pregnant women in second trimester (&gt;= 18 weeks; &lt; 26 weeks) between 18 and 44 years of age, no antihelminthic treatment in the past six months and resident in rural or peri-urban areas (defined as having no running water or flushing toilet facility at home). Any woman with severe anaemia (Hb &lt; 70 g/L) or a medical condition requiring follow-up were excluded. The women were randomised to receive either a single 500 mg dose of mebendazole plus a daily iron supplement (60 mg elemental iron) or a single dose placebo plus a daily iron supplement (60 mg elemental iron). Women in the two groups were similar at baseline in terms of socio-demographic characteristics and pregnancy-related variables. The frequency of intestinal helminths at baseline was: <I>Ascaris lumbricoides</I> 64.2%, hookworms 46.4%, and <I>Trichuris trichura</I> 82% and anaemia (Hb &lt; 110 g/L) was found in 47% of the women.</P>
<P>The trial conducted by Elliott et al (<LINK REF="STD-Elliott-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Elliott 2005</LINK>) in Entebbe, Uganda was a preliminary study including 103 pregnant women in the second trimester of pregnancy. It was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.The treatment group received albendazole 400 mg single dose and the control group received a placebo, regardless of whether they were infected with hookworm or not. Pregnant women with an HbB &lt; 80 g/L, abnormal pregnancy and adverse reaction to antihelminthic drugs were excluded from the study. Study enrolment was stopped after 104 women due to new guidelines by the World Health Organization which recommended inclusion of treatment of women with schistosomiasis. The protocol was revised and then a total of 2507 participants were assigned to receive albendazole (400 mg) and placebo, praziquantel (40 mg/kg) and placebo, albendazole and praziquantel, or placebo and placebo.</P>

Women with severe anaemia (Hb &lt; 7 g/L), a history of habitual abortion, delivering twins, and babies with congenital abnormalities were excluded. Intervention group A (n = 198) received ivermectin, group B (n = 194) received albendazole (a single dose of 400 mg), group C (n = 199) received a combination of ivermectin and albendazole, and group D (n = 241) was a reference group without soil-transmitted helminths.

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-05-18 12:25:51 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Our review included four trials. There was no effect of administration of a single dose of antihelminthics in the second trimester of pregnancy on maternal anaemia, low birthweight, preterm birth or perinatal mortality.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2015-06-10 16:40:32 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>We found four randomised controlled trials evaluating the impact of antihelminthic treatment in the second trimester of pregnancy. All studies were conducted in developing countries in which a single dose of antihelminthic in the second trimester of pregnancy was compared against the control group. Iron supplementation was given as co-intervention in three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Larocque-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Larocque 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ndyomugyenyi-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Ndyomugyenyi 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Torlesse-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Torlesse 2001</LINK>). The review findings showed no impact of antihelminthic treatment in the second trimester of pregnancy on any of the maternal or pregnancy outcomes. The impact on infant survival at six months of age could not be evaluated due to the non-availability of data from the included studies. The findings of the review are generalisable to developing country settings.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2015-06-18 11:45:22 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Leanne V Jones">
<P>The quality of evidence of the <LINK REF="STD-Elliott-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Elliott 2005</LINK> trial is high, given that this study was at low risk of selection, attrition and confounding bias. However, the study enrolment was stopped due to new guidelines by the World Health Organization and continued later with the revised protocol. The <LINK REF="STD-Larocque-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Larocque 2006</LINK> study was also at low risk of bias with adequate allocation concealment, blinding and outcome data. The <LINK REF="STD-Ndyomugyenyi-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Ndyomugyenyi 2008</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Torlesse-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Torlesse 2001</LINK> studies were at unclear risk for allocation concealment.<BR/>
<BR/>The overall GRADE rating of the quality of evidence of this review is from low to moderate. Our primary outcome of 'maternal anaemia' was graded as <I>'low quality evidence</I>'. The outcome was downgraded by two due to high risk of attrition bias in <LINK REF="STD-Torlesse-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Torlesse 2001</LINK> and inconsistency; since a subset of <LINK REF="STD-Torlesse-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Torlesse 2001</LINK> study has shown beneficial effect on maternal anaemia, while all other studies have shown no impact. Our secondary outcomes (low birthweight, preterm birth and perinatal mortality) were graded as '<I>moderate quality evidence</I>'. The outcomes of 'low birthweight' and 'preterm birth' were downgraded by one for unclear risk of selection bias in <LINK REF="STD-Ndyomugyenyi-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Ndyomugyenyi 2008</LINK>. The outcome of 'perinatal mortality' was downgraded by one due to serious indirectness since both the studies (<LINK REF="STD-Elliott-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Elliott 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Larocque-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Larocque 2006</LINK>) were not powered to capture mortality.</P>
<P>Future research is likely to change the estimates and currently we have limited evidence to draw conclusions about the plausible benefits or harms of administering antihelminthics during second trimester of pregnancy.</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2015-06-10 16:40:40 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>The biases in the review process were minimised. There was a systematic evaluation at all stages, including literature search screening, full-text eligibility and data extraction. Two review authors did this independently and resolved discrepancies by discussion among all the review authors. All the outcomes were prespecified in the protocol.</P>

<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2015-06-10 16:40:40 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>A randomised controlled trial (<LINK REF="REF-Christian-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Christian 2004</LINK>) in rural Nepal primarily designed to evaluate the impact of multiple micronutrient supplementation given to women during pregnancy also offered albendazole (400 mg dose) in the second and third trimester of pregnancy for the treatment of possible geo-helminth infection. Findings from this trial suggest that infants born to women who received two doses were of greater birthweight and lower (41%) infant mortality at six months compared to women who did not receive albendazole. However, a single dose failed to show an impact on both of these outcomes.</P>

<P>Evidence to date in this review is insufficient to recommend use of antihelminthic for pregnant women after the first trimester of pregnancy. Although in a subset of a single study in Sierra Leone (<LINK REF="STD-Torlesse-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Torlesse 2001</LINK>), administering antihelminthic in the second trimester of pregnancy along with iron folate has shown beneficial effect on maternal anaemia; however more studies are required to confirm this. Our review also provides insufficient evidence of the impact of antihelminthics on the pregnancy outcomes of low birthweight, perinatal mortality and preterm birth.<BR/>

<P>More well-designed, large scale randomised controlled trials are needed to establish the benefit of antihelminthic treatment during pregnancy. Findings of benefit from a subset of the study in Sierra Leone, warrants confirmation from future large trials.</P>
