<TITLE>Hormones for contraception (birth control) in men</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2012-02-07 18:57:22 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Laureen M Lopez">
<P>Researchers have tried to develop contraceptives for men that would be like birth control pills for women. Hormone birth control for men has been hard to achieve. Giving sex hormones to men can lower the sperm produced. However, this approach also lowers the male hormone testosterone in the body, so some testosterone has to be 'added back.' This review looks at the randomized controlled trials of giving hormones to men to prevent their sexual partners from becoming pregnant.</P>
<P>In January and February 2012, we did a computer search for studies of hormones tested for contraception in men. We also looked at reference lists of articles. We considered randomized controlled trials in any language. We wrote to trial authors to find other studies we may have missed.</P>
<P>We found 33 studies. The focus of the trials was having no sperm found in semen. The percent of men who achieved no sperm varied widely. We found a few major differences and list them here. 1) Implants plus injected testosterone worked better than a pill plus testosterone patch. 2) Adding a hormone pill improved the effect of testosterone injected weekly. 3) A hormone pill also improved the effect of a testosterone injection with more injections at 6 and 12 weeks. 4) A lower dose pill did not work as well as a higher dose when testosterone was put under the skin (implant). 5) When used with implants, a lower dose of injected testosterone led to no sperm more often than a higher dose. 6) An injected hormone plus injected testosterone led to no sperm more often when given every 8 weeks versus 12 weeks. 7) Four implants of a male hormone worked better than two implants.</P>
<P>Several trials showed good results for the percent with no sperm. Five trials studied testosterone and another hormone. The other hormones were desogestrel, etonogestrel, and levonorgestrel.</P>
<P>No hormonal birth control for men is ready for general use. Most trials were small pilot studies trying out different hormone treatments. Larger trials with better methods are needed to test good leads in this area.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Male hormonal contraception has been an elusive goal. Administration of sex steroids to men can shut off sperm production through effects on the pituitary and hypothalamus. However, this approach also decreases production of testosterone, so 'add-back' therapy is needed.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2009-03-24 19:40:09 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Laureen M Lopez">
<P>To summarize all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of male hormonal contraception.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2012-02-07 18:25:11 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Laureen M Lopez">
<P>In January and February 2012, we searched the computerized databases CENTRAL, MEDLINE, POPLINE, and LILACS. We also searched for recent trials in ClinicalTrials.gov and ICTRP. Previous searches included EMBASE. We wrote to authors of identified trials to seek additional unpublished or published trials.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2009-03-24 19:42:58 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Laureen M Lopez">
<P>We included all RCTs that compared a steroid hormone with another contraceptive. We excluded non-steroidal male contraceptives, such as gossypol. We included both placebo and active-regimen control groups. </P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2009-04-02 16:47:42 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Laureen M Lopez">
<P>The primary outcome measure was the absence of spermatozoa on semen examination, often called azoospermia. Data were insufficient to examine pregnancy rates and side effects.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-02-07 18:55:19 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Laureen M Lopez">
<P>We found 33 trials that met our inclusion criteria. The proportion of men who reportedly achieved azoospermia or had no detectable sperm varied widely. A few important differences emerged. 1) Levonorgestrel implants (160 &#956;g daily) combined with injectable testosterone enanthate (TE) were more effective than levonorgestrel 125 µg daily combined with testosterone patches. 2) Levonorgestrel 500 &#956;g daily improved the effectiveness of TE 100 mg injected weekly. 3) Levonorgestrel 250 &#956;g daily improved the effectiveness of testosterone undecanoate (TU) 1000 mg injection plus TU 500 mg injected at 6 and 12 weeks. 4) Desogestrel 150 &#956;g was less effective than desogestrel 300 &#956;g (with testosterone pellets). 5) TU 500 mg was less likely to produce azoospermia than TU 1000 mg (with levonorgestrel implants). 6) Norethisterone enanthate 200 mg with TU 1000 mg led to more azoospermia when given every 8 weeks versus 12 weeks. 7) Four implants of 7-alpha-methyl-19-nortestosterone (MENT) were more effective than two MENT implants. We did not conduct any meta-analysis due to intervention differences.</P>
<P>Several trials showed promising efficacy in percentages with azoospermia. Three examined desogestrel and testosterone preparations or etonogestrel and testosterone, and two examined levonorgestrel and testosterone.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2009-04-02 17:03:49 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Laureen M Lopez">
<P>No male hormonal contraceptive is ready for clinical use. Most trials were small exploratory studies. Their power to detect important differences was limited and their results imprecise. In addition, assessment of azoospermia can vary by sensitivity of the method used. Future trials need more attention to the methodological requirements for RCTs. More trials with adequate power would also be helpful.</P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2012-02-07 19:25:58 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Laureen M Lopez">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2012-02-07 18:59:14 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Laureen M Lopez">
<P>Over the years, the goal of male hormonal contraception has proven elusive (<LINK REF="REF-Potts-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Potts 1996</LINK>). Azoospermia (no detectable sperm in semen) has been more difficult to achieve in men than has been anovulation in women. The ideal male hormonal contraceptive would cause azoospermia consistently and reversibly without associated adverse effects (<LINK REF="REF-Anderson-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anderson 2000</LINK>). Challenges in product development have included incomplete or heterogeneous sperm suppression, the lack of long-acting steroid preparations, and undesired metabolic effects (<LINK REF="REF-Wenk-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wenk 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wu-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wu 2006</LINK>). Nevertheless, several recent approaches to suppressing sperm production have shown promise (<LINK REF="REF-Amory-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Amory 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Page-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Page 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>Luteinizing hormone and, to a lesser extent, follicle stimulating hormone govern spermatogenesis in the testis. Reducing the levels of these pituitary gonadotropins diminishes sperm production. Administration of exogenous sex steroids to men provides negative feedback to the hypothalamic-pituitary axis, suppressing gonadotropin release and, subsequently, sperm production. This inhibition is analogous to the mechanism of anovulation in women using oral contraceptives. Suppression of gonadotropin secretion also reduces testosterone production, so 'add-back' androgen therapy is needed to maintain physiological levels. Examples of 'add-back' treatment include implantable testosterone pellets or intramuscular (IM) injections.</P>
<P>Androgens have been a major focus of attempts to develop a male hormonal contraceptive (<LINK REF="REF-Anawalt-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anawalt 2001</LINK>). Weekly injections of testosterone enanthate can depress sperm production, but this effect is not uniform (<LINK REF="REF-Wu-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wu 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wu-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wu 2006</LINK>). Side effects include weight gain and reduction in HDL cholesterol.</P>
<P>Longer-acting testosterone preparations include testosterone undecanoate, testosterone buciclate, testosterone decanoate, and testosterone implants. These options might obviate the need for weekly IM administration. The most promising of these may be testosterone undecanoate, which has led to variable degrees of sperm suppression (<LINK REF="REF-Zhang-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhang 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>The synthetic androgen 7-alpha-methyl-19-nortestosterone (MENT) is another prospect. This molecule is resistant to 5 alpha-reductase, which converts testosterone to dihydrotestosterone (DHT), which, in turn, possibly causes several undesirable androgenic effects. Because it is orally inactive and has a short half-life, MENT would likely need to be administered as an implant.</P>
<P>Combination regimens have also attracted attention as male contraceptives. For example, androgens can be administered with gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogues. Combination regimens might lead to better suppression of gonadotropins and sperm production than could a single agent. GnRH antagonists appear superior to agonists in suppressing sperm production (<LINK REF="REF-Anawalt-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anawalt 2001</LINK>). The cost of current GnRH analogues, however, poses a barrier to this approach.</P>
<P>Androgens have also been tested in combination with progestins, including levonorgestrel, desogestrel, and cyproterone acetate. This combination suppresses sperm production better than does testosterone alone. Promising results have been obtained with both desogestrel and cyproterone acetate combined with testosterone (<LINK REF="REF-Anawalt-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anawalt 2001</LINK>). Another variation on this theme has been long-acting steroids, such as depot testosterone combined with depo-medroxyprogesterone acetate. Again, sperm suppression in RCTs has not been uniform, and side effects have included weight gain and lowering of HDL cholesterol (<LINK REF="REF-Anawalt-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anawalt 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>The limited available evidence suggests that azoospermia or 'no detectable sperm,' rather than oligozoospermia (diminished sperm counts), may be necessary for effective male contraception. However, a short-term goal proposed for developing a male contraceptive is uniformly suppressing sperm count to less than one million/mL (<LINK REF="REF-Amory-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Amory 2006</LINK>). Pregnancy rates appear related to sperm counts (<LINK REF="REF-Barfield-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barfield 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1996</LINK>), but pregnancy rates remain the best clinical endpoint.</P>

<P>This review summarizes the randomized controlled trials evaluating steroid hormones administered to men for contraception.</P>

<CRIT_STUDIES MODIFIED="2009-04-02 17:22:13 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Laureen M Lopez">
<P>We included all randomized controlled trials in any language that compared a steroid hormone with another contraceptive. We excluded non-steroidal approaches to male contraception, which were addressed in another systematic review (<LINK REF="REF-Lopez-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lopez 2005</LINK>). Non-steroidal agents include vaccines and immunomodulators (e.g., gossypol and neem) (<LINK REF="REF-Jensen-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jensen 2002</LINK>). Although large case series have been reported (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1990</LINK>) and others are in progress, we limited our review to randomized controlled trials.</P>
</CRIT_STUDIES>
<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>All men included in the eligible trials were incorporated in the review. All trials included only healthy men with normal semen analyses.</P>
</CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>We included any regimen that used a steroid hormone administered to a man as one of the treatments. These included androgens, such as testosterone; GnRH analogues plus testosterone; and testosterone plus progestins, such as levonorgestrel, desogestrel, or cyproterone acetate. Both single-drug and combination regimens were included in the review. Both placebo and active-regimen control groups were eligible for inclusion.</P>
</CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<CRIT_OUTCOMES>
<P>Researchers have noted that few studies have examined pregnancy as the outcome (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pollanen-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Pollanen 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kamischke-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Kamischke 2002</LINK>). Sperm counts were the usual outcome measure in these exploratory trials. We excluded trials that used other surrogate markers, such as gonadotropins or testosterone (<LINK REF="STD-Behre-1992b" TYPE="STUDY">Behre 1992b</LINK>). The most common outcome measure was sperm count expressed as a dichotomous variable: azoospermia (absence of sperm) and oligozoospermia (variably defined as sperm concentration less than 1 million, 3 million, or 20 million/mL). </P>
<P>In this review, we focus exclusively on azoospermia for three reasons. First, azoospermia will likely be required for adequate contraceptive efficacy (<LINK REF="REF-Barfield-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barfield 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kinniburgh-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Kinniburgh 2001</LINK>), so this was chosen as the outcome of primary interest. Second, definitions of oligozoospermia or severe oligozoospermia varied from trial to trial, thus precluding comparisons between studies. Third, most reports incorrectly calculated the proportion of men with oligozoospermia by excluding those with azoospermia from the numerator. Since all these trials were exploratory in nature and reporting of side effects was inconsistent, we limited our analysis to sperm effects. Time to azoospermia was not consistently reported.</P>

<P>All titles and abstracts located in the literature searches were assessed for inclusion. Two reviewers extracted data from the studies identified for inclusion to increase accuracy. Data were entered and analyzed with RevMan, and a second reviewer verified the data entered. Peto odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were used for the dichotomous outcomes. We did not combine data from studies with different interventions. Therefore, we were not able to conduct any meta-analysis due to the variety of interventions. </P>
<P>We evaluated the trials for potential biases by qualitatively assessing the study design, blinding, randomization method, group allocation concealment, and rates for loss to follow up and early discontinuation. We wrote to the corresponding author of included trials to ask for supplementary data as needed. We also sent a list of trials we had found and asked authors if they knew of any published or unpublished trials we had missed. Correspondence with one author led to exclusion of two reports, and correspondence with another corrected published data on azoospermia.</P>

<P>Several trials examined desogestrel and testosterone regimens. In two of three comparisons by <LINK REF="STD-Anawalt-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Anawalt 2000</LINK>, a lower proportion of men achieved azoospermia with the lower doses of hormones, although these differences were not important; the range was 57% to 100%. In the African trial comparing different doses of desogestrel combined with testosterone pellets, <LINK REF="STD-Anderson-2002b" TYPE="STUDY">Anderson 2002b</LINK> found disparate results in the two sites (test for heterogeneity P = 0.05). <LINK REF="STD-Martin-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Martin 2000</LINK> found no azoospermia at the lowest doses of desogestrel and testosterone implants. Higher dosages of desogestrel by mouth (300 &#956;g daily) were associated with higher proportions of azoospermia, but the maximum achieved was only 30% in this eight-week trial. <LINK REF="STD-Kinniburgh-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Kinniburgh 2001</LINK> found similar proportions with azoospermia for desogestrel and testosterone pellets with and without addition of finasteride (71% versus 75%).

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Etonogestrel and testosterone</HEADING>
<P>Trials with etonogestrel and testosterone had no major differences between study groups, but azoospermia was higher than in some earlier studies. <LINK REF="STD-Anderson-2002a" TYPE="STUDY">Anderson 2002a</LINK> found a slightly lower proportion of men with azoospermia with the lower dose of etonogestrel implants when combined with the same testosterone dose (64% versus 75%). In <LINK REF="STD-Brady-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Brady 2006</LINK>, etonogestrel implants were given with testosterone decanoate at four weeks or six weeks and with different doses of testosterone.

Testosterone undecanoate included 1000 mg initially, followed by TU 500 mg at weeks 6 and 12. In addition, TU plus testicular warming led to more azoospermia than did testicular warming alone, but the CI was wide (OR 19.24; 95% CI 0.99 to 373.01) (<LINK REF="STD-Wang-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2007</LINK>).</P>

No data were analyzed from <LINK REF="STD-Pollanen-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Pollanen 2001</LINK>, since the numbers assigned to each group were not available.<BR/>
<BR/>Testosterone alone appeared ineffective, and a dose-response effect was not consistently seen. Lower doses of testosterone buciclate IM (<LINK REF="STD-Behre-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Behre 1995</LINK>) and testosterone implants (<LINK REF="STD-Handelsman-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Handelsman 1996</LINK>) caused less azoospermia than did higher doses, although the proportions were low for all regimens (maximum 40%). With testosterone enanthate IM alone, a three-fold higher dose appeared comparable to a dose of 100 mg weekly; the maximum proportion with azoospermia was only 60% (<LINK REF="STD-Matsumoto-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Matsumoto 1990</LINK>). The combination of estradiol implants and testosterone implants offered no advantage over testosterone implants alone (<LINK REF="STD-Handelsman-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Handelsman 2000</LINK>). With all regimens tested, the proportion of men achieving azoospermia was low (maximum 43%).</P>

<P>GnRH agonists and antagonists appear ineffective. The addition of Nal-Glu to testosterone enanthate IM weekly conferred no benefit (<LINK REF="STD-Bagatell-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Bagatell 1993</LINK>). With buserelin (<LINK REF="STD-Behre-1992a" TYPE="STUDY">Behre 1992a</LINK>), all regimens tested had poor efficacy (maximum 50%), and no significant differences emerged among those tested. The one study of MENT in acetate (<LINK REF="STD-Von-Eckardstein-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Von Eckardstein 2003</LINK>) indicated that four MENT implants were more likely to produce azoospermia than two implants (64% versus 18%).

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2009-03-24 19:46:02 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Laureen M Lopez">
<P>A practical male hormonal contraceptive remains elusive. Regimens tested to date varied widely (zero to 100%) in the proportion of men achieving azoospermia. In addition, observation periods ranged from eight weeks to a year. A few important differences emerged:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>levonorgestrel implants (160 &#956;g per day) combined with injectable testosterone enanthate were more effective than levonorgestrel 125 µg by mouth daily combined with testosterone patches (<LINK REF="STD-Gonzalo-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Gonzalo 2002</LINK>)</LI>
<LI>levonorgestrel 500 &#956;g by mouth daily improved the effectiveness of testosterone enanthate 100 mg IM weekly (<LINK REF="STD-Bebb-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Bebb 1996</LINK>)</LI>
<LI>levonorgestrel 250 &#956;g by mouth daily improved the effectiveness of testosterone undecanoate (TU) 1000 mg IM plus TU 500 mg IM at 6 and 12 weeks (<LINK REF="STD-Wang-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2007</LINK>)</LI>
<LI>desogestrel 150 &#956;g was less effective than desogestrel 300 &#956;g (with testosterone pellets) (<LINK REF="STD-Kinniburgh-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Kinniburgh 2002</LINK>)</LI>
<LI>testosterone undecanoate 500 mg was less likely to produce azoospermia than testosterone undecanoate 1000 mg (with levonorgestrel implants) (<LINK REF="STD-Gui-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Gui 2004</LINK>)</LI>
<LI>norethisterone enanthate 200 mg with testosterone undecanoate 1000 mg led to more azoospermia when given every 8 weeks versus 12 weeks (<LINK REF="STD-Meriggiola-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Meriggiola 2005</LINK>)</LI>
<LI>four MENT implants were more effective than two MENT implants (<LINK REF="STD-Von-Eckardstein-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Von Eckardstein 2003</LINK>).</LI>
</UL>
<P>Several trials showed promising efficacy, with at least one group having 80% azoospermia. Some of these studies examined desogestrel and testosterone preparations or etonogestrel (metabolite of desogestrel) and testosterone. The trials with reasonable sample sizes, such that percentages might be meaningful, were <LINK REF="STD-Kinniburgh-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Kinniburgh 2002</LINK> (N=66 with two groups), <LINK REF="STD-Brady-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Brady 2006</LINK> (N=130 with three groups), and <LINK REF="STD-Hay-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Hay 2005</LINK> (N=112 with two groups). <LINK REF="STD-Brady-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Brady 2006</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Hay-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Hay 2005</LINK> had consistently high proportions with azoospermia (78% to 95%). In addition, two trials that examined levonorgestrel and testosterone had at least one group with 80% azoospermia, and they had at least 20 men per group (<LINK REF="STD-Gonzalo-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Gonzalo 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gui-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Gui 2004</LINK>). The other trials with similar results were small, and the power to detect clinically important differences was poor. As a result of small sample sizes, the proportions with azoospermia are imprecise. For example, <LINK REF="STD-Wu-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Wu 1999</LINK> concluded that a treatment provided the "most effective suppression" of sperm, based on 8/8 versus 6/8 participants achieving azoospermia. This conclusion is not justified.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2009-06-09 18:08:42 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Laureen M Lopez">
<P>A common problem with these trials has been imprecise terminology (<LINK REF="REF-Grimes-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grimes 2007</LINK>). While azoospermia generally refers to absence of sperm, oligozoospermia (also termed oligospermia) means a subnormal number of sperm (<LINK REF="REF-Stedman-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stedman 2000</LINK>). Thus, azoospermia is a severe variant of oligozoospermia. Most authors of randomized controlled trial reports, however, described these as distinct, mutually exclusive, entities. This is inconsistent with the definitions of oligozoospermia provided in many of these reports. Therefore, we limited this review to the outcome of azoospermia or no detectable sperm, according to the terminology in the original reports. The determination of 'no sperm' depends of the sensitivity of the measurement method.</P>
<P>One trial (Kamischke 2000 of <LINK REF="STD-Nieschlag-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Nieschlag 2000</LINK>) highlights this internal inconsistency. The original report indicated that "In the placebo group 4 out of 14 and in the levonorgestrel group 7 out of 14 men achieved severe oligozoospermia (less than 3 billion/L)." In an erratum to this report, an author (<LINK REF="STD-Nieschlag-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Nieschlag 2000</LINK>) reported that "Sperm concentrations were...&lt;3 million/ml in 12/14 and 14/14 volunteers of the placebo and gestagen treated groups, respectively." The latter report included azoospermia in the definition of severe oligozoospermia, whereas the former did not. This discrepancy is unexplained.</P>

<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2012-02-07 19:25:58 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Laureen M Lopez">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>No male hormonal contraceptive is available for clinical use. The efficacy of these regimens remains unknown.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2012-02-07 19:25:58 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Laureen M Lopez">
<P>Of the regimens tested in RCTs, some combinations of a progestin plus testosterone may hold promise. In contrast, further research with the doses of testosterone alone used in these trials appears unwarranted, as is the case with the GnRH analogues tested to date.</P>
<P>The definition of oligozoospermia has been ambiguous for decades (<LINK REF="REF-Eliasson-1970" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eliasson 1970</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1999</LINK>). Because of inconsistent or ambiguous definitions, oligozoospermia data are hard to interpret. The World Health Organization, which has promulgated guidelines in this area (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1999</LINK>), should take the lead in establishing proper definitions.</P>
<P>Eventually, clinical trials with sufficient power to determine efficacy in preventing pregnancy may be required. These trials will need to examine safety regarding cardiovascular and prostate disease, as well as other adverse events, such as weight gain and effects on serum lipids and the liver. Future randomized controlled trials of male hormonal contraception should follow internationally accepted guidelines to eliminate or minimize bias (<LINK REF="REF-CONSORT" TYPE="REFERENCE">CONSORT</LINK>). In published reports to date, research methods have received insufficient attention.</P>

<P>Our initial review in 2004 failed to identify one important randomized controlled trial (<LINK REF="STD-Kinniburgh-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Kinniburgh 2002</LINK>). This stemmed from the published report's non-compliance with CONSORT guidelines. The word 'randomized' did not appear in either the title or the abstract, and thus the report was missed during computerized searches.</P>
