<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2015-11-20 13:56:16 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>Partner abuse (domestic violence) is common worldwide. It includes physical, emotional, and sexual abuse; threats; withholding money; causing injury; and long-lasting physical and emotional health problems. Advocacy (active support by trained people) may help women make safety plans, deal with abuse, and access community resources.</P>
<P>Evidence on the effects of advocacy will help service planning and provision.</P>
<P>
<B>Method</B>
</P>
<P>We searched scientific literature worldwide up to April 2015 for clinical trials comparing advocacy for abused women with no care or usual care, to understand whether advocacy was safe and effective. We found 13 trials conducted in several countries, involving 2141 women from various ethnic groups, aged 15 to 65 years and often poor.</P>
<P>Studies varied in terms of advocacy duration (30 minutes to 80 hours) and participating staff (students, nurses, professional advocates, psychologists, social workers, community health workers, mothers in antenatal clinics, researchers). Eleven measured abuse, six assessed quality of life, and six measured depression. Three considered advocacy plus psychiatric help. Most studies followed up on the women for at least a year.</P>
<P>Studies recruited women from healthcare settings, domestic violence refuges/shelters, and community centres. Brief advocacy (up to 12 hours) was most common in healthcare settings, and intensive advocacy (more than 12 hours) was more common in other settings.</P>
<P>
<B>Key outcomes</B>
</P>
<P>
<I>Quality of the evidence</I>
</P>
<P>Five studies had design flaws that entailed a high risk of biasing their results, while five had moderate risk and three studies had low risk.</P>
<P>
<I>Physical abuse</I>
</P>
<P>After one year, brief advocacy had no effect in two healthcare studies of moderate quality or in one community study at low risk of bias, but it reduced minor abuse in another antenatal care study (low risk of bias). Another antenatal study showed reduced abuse immediately after brief advocacy (with one woman likely to benefit if eight received the advocacy), but women were also treated for depression, which may have affected results. Two studies provided weak evidence that intensive advocacy reduces physical abuse up to two years after the intervention (with one in eight women likely to benefit).</P>
<P>
<I>Sexual abuse</I>
</P>
<P>Four studies failed to show benefits from advocacy for sexual abuse.</P>
<P>
<I>Emotional abuse</I>
</P>
<P>One antenatal care study (low risk of bias) reported reduced emotional abuse at 12 months after advocacy.</P>
<P>
<I>Depression</I>
</P>
<P>Brief advocacy prevented depression in abused women attending healthcare services and pregnant women immediately after advocacy (with one woman likely to benefit for every four to eight treated). Intensive advocacy did not reduce depression in shelter women followed up at 12 and 24 months. The moderate-to-low quality evidence came mostly from studies with a low risk of bias.</P>
<P>
<I>Quality of life</I>
</P>
<P>Three brief advocacy trials found no benefit on quality of life. Intensive advocacy showed a weak benefit in two studies in domestic violence shelters/refuges. A primary care study (high risk of bias) showed improved motivation to do daily tasks immediately after advocacy.</P>
<P>
<I>Deaths</I>
</P>
<P>Two women died: one was murdered by her partner and one committed suicide; however, investigators did not consider these deaths to be related to the studies.</P>
<P>
<B>Conclusions</B>
</P>
<P>Intensive advocacy may improve everyday life for women in domestic violence shelters/refuges in the short term and reduce physical abuse one to two years after the intervention. There is no clear evidence that intensive advocacy reduces sexual, emotional, or overall abuse, or that it benefits women&#8217;s mental health. It is unclear whether brief advocacy (mostly given in healthcare settings) is effective, although it may provide short-term mental health benefits and reduce abuse, particularly in pregnant women and those suffering less severe abuse.</P>
<P>We considered the results of several studies to be potentially biased because of weak study designs. There was little consistency between studies, with variations in the amount of advocacy given, the type of benefits measured, and the lengths of follow-up periods. As a result, it was hard to combine their results, and we cannot be certain of how much advocacy interventions benefit women or the impact of the type of advocacy, the place it was given, or the severity of the abuse experienced by the women receiving the intervention.<BR/>

<ABSTRACT MODIFIED="2015-11-20 15:34:55 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2015-09-07 16:51:55 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Intimate partner abuse is common worldwide, damaging the short- and long-term physical, mental, and emotional health of survivors and children. Advocacy may contribute to reducing abuse, empowering women to improve their situation by providing informal counselling and support for safety planning and increasing access to different services. Advocacy may be a stand-alone service, accepting referrals from healthcare providers, or part of a multi-component (and possibly multi-agency) intervention provided by service staff or others.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2015-09-01 15:37:38 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>To assess the effects of advocacy interventions within or outside healthcare settings in women who have experienced intimate partner abuse.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2015-11-20 12:24:17 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In April 2015, we searched CENTRAL, Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, and 10 other databases. We also searched WHO ICTRP, mRCT, and UK Clinical Research Network (UKCRN), and examined relevant websites and reference lists with forward citation tracking of included studies. For the original review we handsearched six key journals. We also contacted first authors of eligible papers and experts in the field.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2015-09-01 15:25:51 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing advocacy interventions for women with experience of intimate partner abuse versus no intervention or usual care (if advocacy was minimal and fewer than 20% of women received it).</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2015-09-01 15:59:51 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two review authors independently assessed risk of bias and undertook data extraction. We contacted authors for missing information needed to calculate statistics for the review and looked for adverse events.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-11-20 15:34:55 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included 13 trials involving 2141 participants aged 15 to 65 years, frequently having low socioeconomic status.</P>
<P>The studies were quite heterogeneous in terms of methodology, study processes and design, including with regard to the duration of follow-up (postintervention to three years), although this was not associated with differences in effect. The studies also had considerable clinical heterogeneity in relation to staff delivering advocacy; setting (community, shelter, antenatal, healthcare); advocacy intensity (from 30 minutes to 80 hours); and abuse severity. Three trials evaluated advocacy within multi-component interventions. Eleven measured some form of abuse (eight scales), six assessed quality of life (three scales), and six measured depression (three scales). Countries and ethnic groups varied (one or more minority ethnic groups in the USA or UK, and local populations in Hong Kong and Peru). Setting was associated with intensity and duration of advocacy.</P>
<P>Risk of bias was high in five studies, moderate in five, and low in three. The quality of evidence (considering multiple factors such as risk of bias, study size, missing data) was moderate to low for brief advocacy and very low for intensive advocacy.</P>
<P>
<B>Incidence of abuse</B>
</P>
<P>
<I>Physical abuse</I>
</P>
<P>Moderate quality pooled data from two healthcare studies (moderate risk of bias) and one community study (low risk of bias), all with 12-month follow-up data, showed no effect on physical abuse for brief (&lt; 12 hours) advocacy interventions (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.00, 95% confidence interval (CI) - 0.17 to 0.16; n = 558). One antenatal study (low risk of bias) showed an association between brief advocacy and reduced minor physical abuse at one year (mean difference (MD) change - 1.00, 95% CI - 1.82 to - 0.18; n = 110). An antenatal, multi-component study showed a greater likelihood of physical abuse ending (odds ratio (OR) 0.42, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.75) immediately after advocacy (number needed to treat (NNT) = 8); we cannot exclude impact from other components.</P>
<P>Low to very low quality evidence from two intensive advocacy trials (12 hours plus duration) showed reduced severe physical abuse in women leaving a shelter at 24 months (OR 0.39, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.77; NNT = 8), but not at 12 or 36 months.</P>
<P>
<I>Sexual abuse</I>
</P>
<P>Meta-analysis of two studies (n = 239) showed no effect of advocacy on sexual abuse (SMD - 0.12, 95% CI - 0.37 to 0.14), agreeing with the change score (MD - 0.07, 95% CI - 0.30 to 0.16) from a third study and the OR (0.96, 95% CI 0.44 to 2.12) from a fourth antenatal, multi-component study.</P>
<P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Intimate partner abuse</HEADING>
<P>For the purpose of this review, intimate partner abuse (also known as domestic violence) is defined as the abuse of a woman by a male or female partner who currently is, or formerly was, in an intimate relationship with her. Intimate partner abuse perpetrated against male partners or ex-partners also occurs, but it is not included in this review because the outcomes, and possibly the risks for partner violence, are likely to differ by gender. Most abuse with serious health and other consequences is committed by men against their female partners (<LINK REF="REF-Henwood-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Henwood 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Roe-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roe 2010</LINK>). We also include abuse perpetrated by ex-partners in the review, since a woman is often at greatest risk when she is preparing to leave or has just left her partner (<LINK REF="REF-Brownridge-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brownridge 2006</LINK>). Women who leave violent relationships often continue to be abused, sometimes because the partner pursues them or because they choose to return (<LINK REF="REF-Campbell-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Campbell 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Campbell-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Campbell 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Holt-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Holt 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mullen-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mullen 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shalansky-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shalansky 1999</LINK>). It is estimated that between 65% and 75% of women killed by abusive partners are leaving or have already ended the relationship (<LINK REF="REF-Wilson-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wilson 1993</LINK>). Intimate partner abuse may take various forms, including physical violence (ranging from slaps, punches, and kicks to choking, armed assault with a weapon, and homicide), sexual violence (such as forced sex or forced participation in sexual acts), emotionally abusive behaviours (such as stalking, surveillance, threats of abuse, threats to remove children from the household, prohibiting a woman from seeing her family and friends, ongoing belittlement or humiliation, and intimidation), economic restrictions (such as preventing a woman from working, confiscating her earnings, restricting access to funds), and other controlling behaviours (<LINK REF="REF-Watts-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Watts 2002</LINK>). The different forms of abuse often coexist, but they may also occur in isolation (<LINK REF="REF-Hegarty-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hegarty 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>Partner abuse may also coexist with other forms of violence within families, such as child abuse or elder abuse, but such abuse is not the focus of this review.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Prevalence of intimate partner abuse</HEADING>
<P>The 2010/11 British Crime Survey found that 27% of women in England and Wales had some experience with domestic violence after the age of 16 (<LINK REF="REF-Chaplin-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chaplin 2011</LINK>). Repeat victimisation accounted for three-quarters (73%) of all such incidents. The global figure for prevalence of physical or intimate partner abuse reported by the World Health Organization (WHO) is 30% (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2013a" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2013a</LINK>). Data collected in the United States in 2005 and in 2010 indicate that one out of every three to four women experience violence by a current or former partner at some point in their life, with 2 million injuries from intimate partner violence each year and nearly 18 million over their lifetimes (<LINK REF="REF-Black-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Black 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-CDC-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">CDC 2008</LINK>). The prevalence of intimate partner abuse among women seeking healthcare is higher than that of the general population (<LINK REF="REF-Feder-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Feder 2009</LINK>). In a primary care study, we found a lifetime experience of physical and sexual violence of 41%, with 17% of women experiencing such violence in the past year (<LINK REF="REF-Richardson-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Richardson 2002</LINK>). Abuse of women by their partners is a global phenomenon, although most studies on it have taken place in industrialised countries (<LINK REF="REF-Krug-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Krug 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Watts-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Watts 2002</LINK>). A WHO study that used standardised population-based household surveys showed a lifetime prevalence of physical or sexual intimate partner abuse of 15% to 71% in 10 low- and middle-income countries (<LINK REF="REF-Garcia_x002d_Moreno-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Garcia-Moreno 2006</LINK>), while more recently, <LINK REF="REF-WHO-2013a" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2013a</LINK> cites a range of 23% to 37% depending on the region of the world.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">The impact of intimate partner abuse on women's health</HEADING>
<P>Intimate partner abuse can have short-term and long-term negative health consequences for survivors even after the abuse has ended (<LINK REF="REF-Campbell-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Campbell 2002</LINK>). World Development Reports and statements from the United Nations emphasise that such violence is a significant cause of death and disability on a global scale (<LINK REF="REF-Ingram-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ingram 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-World-Bank-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">World Bank 2006</LINK>), and the WHO highlights violence against women as a priority health issue (<LINK REF="REF-Krug-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Krug 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>On average, two women in England and Wales are killed each week by their current or former partners. In 2008 to 2009, this cause accounted for 53% of all female homicide cases (<LINK REF="REF-Smith-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smith 2010</LINK>). In the United States, it is estimated that partner abuse results in approximately 1200 female deaths each year (<LINK REF="REF-CDC-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">CDC 2003</LINK>). Percentages may be even higher in less industrialised countries; internationally, the WHO reports that between 40% and 70% of female murder victims (depending on the country) were killed by a current or former partner (<LINK REF="REF-Krug-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Krug 2002</LINK>). Across all countries with available data, the WHO reports that partner violence is responsible for an average of 38% of all homicides of women (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2013a" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2013a</LINK>).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Physical health of abused women</HEADING>
<P>Intimate partner abuse is one of the most common causes of non-fatal injury in women (<LINK REF="REF-Ellsberg-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ellsberg 2008</LINK>). In the USA, a review estimated that partner abuse to women accounted for 50% of all acute injuries and 21% of all injuries requiring urgent surgery (<LINK REF="REF-Guth-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guth 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>Abused women also experience many chronic health problems. The most consistent and largest physical health difference between abused and non-abused women relates to gynaecological problems (e.g. sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), vaginal bleeding and infection, genital irritation, chronic pelvic pain, and urinary tract infections) (<LINK REF="REF-Campbell-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Campbell 2002</LINK>). Population-based studies from the United States show that the likelihood that abused women will exhibit these symptoms is three times greater than average (<LINK REF="REF-McCauley-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">McCauley 1995</LINK>). Women with a history of partner abuse are more likely to have had an induced abortion (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2013a" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2013a</LINK>) and there is growing recognition that partner violence also increases a woman's risk of contracting HIV, either directly through unprotected contact with an infected man and indirectly through the effects of prolonged exposure to stress in their social context (<LINK REF="REF-Coker-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Coker 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-2013a" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2013a</LINK>). Moreover, in a UK study (<LINK REF="REF-John-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">John 2004</LINK>), significantly more abused women complained of lower abdominal pain, dysmenorrhoea, dyspareunia, smear abnormalities, cancer worries, and bowel symptoms than did a group of non-abused women.</P>
<P>Other conditions include chronic pain (e.g. headaches, back pain), central nervous system symptoms (e.g. fainting and seizures) (<LINK REF="REF-Bonomi-2009a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bonomi 2009a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Campbell-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Campbell 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Diaz_x002d_Olavarrieta-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Diaz-Olavarrieta 1999</LINK>), self-reported gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g. loss of appetite, eating disorders), diagnosed functional gastrointestinal disorders (e.g. irritable bowel syndrome) (<LINK REF="REF-Bonomi-2009a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bonomi 2009a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Coker-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Coker 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Diaz_x002d_Olavarrieta-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Diaz-Olavarrieta 1999</LINK>), and self-reported cardiovascular symptoms (e.g. hypertension, chest pain) (<LINK REF="REF-Coker-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Coker 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tollestrup-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tollestrup 1999</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Health of abused women during pregnancy</HEADING>
<P>Research evidence shows that intimate partner abuse continues when a woman becomes pregnant (<LINK REF="REF-Silva-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Silva 2011</LINK>); indeed, it may even escalate (<LINK REF="REF-Gazmararian-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gazmararian 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mezey-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mezey 1997</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-Campbell-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Campbell 2002</LINK> shows that prevalence rates of abuse during pregnancy are very similar in industrialised and non-industrialised countries.</P>
<P>The health risks for abused mothers and their unborn children are substantial. The most serious outcome is the death of the mother (<LINK REF="REF-El-Kady-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">El Kady 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Parsons-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parsons 1999</LINK>) or the foetus (<LINK REF="REF-El-Kady-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">El Kady 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jejeebhoy-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jejeebhoy 1998</LINK>). In well-designed studies, the outcome most associated with partner abuse is low birth weight, although there is also evidence for increased risk of miscarriage (<LINK REF="REF-Gazmararian-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gazmararian 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Taft-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Taft 2004</LINK>), preterm birth (<LINK REF="REF-Lipsky-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lipsky 2003</LINK>), and foetal injury (<LINK REF="REF-Mezey-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mezey 1997</LINK>). A retrospective population-based cohort study in Australia showed that pregnant women who were hospitalised for an incident of interpersonal violence carried almost twice the risk for adverse maternal complications compared with the non-exposed group, and the overall risk for adverse foetal complications likewise increased twofold (<LINK REF="REF-Meuleners-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meuleners 2011</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Psychosocial health of abused women</HEADING>
<P>Mental health problems are common sequelae of partner abuse (<LINK REF="REF-Ellsberg-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ellsberg 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rees-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rees 2011</LINK>), with many survivors reporting that it is the psychological abuse, rather than the physical violence, which has the most long-lasting adverse effects on their well-being (<LINK REF="REF-Campbell-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Campbell 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>The most prevalent mental health sequelae of intimate partner abuse are post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety, and depressive disorders (<LINK REF="REF-Coid-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Coid 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Trevillion-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Trevillion 2012</LINK>). These associations are also present for perinatal mental health disorders (<LINK REF="REF-Howard-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Howard 2013</LINK>). Women living in abusive relationships are two to three times more likely to be diagnosed for depression or psychosis (<LINK REF="REF-Rodriguez-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rodriguez 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stark-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stark 1996</LINK>), and they often have feelings of low self-esteem and hopelessness (<LINK REF="REF-Kirkwood-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kirkwood 1993</LINK>). Among Australian women attending general practice who have been abused, those who have experienced combined physical, emotional, and sexual abuse are much more likely to be diagnosed with depression than women who have only experienced one kind of abuse (<LINK REF="REF-Hegarty-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hegarty 2004</LINK>). Living in a violent relationship may exacerbate a predisposition to depression; however, a woman's first exposure to abuse can also be a causal factor for subsequent depression (<LINK REF="REF-Campbell-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Campbell 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Silva-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Silva 1997</LINK>). Abused women are nearly four times as likely to suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder than non-abused women, and this can be directly related to experiencing intimate partner abuse (<LINK REF="REF-Golding-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Golding 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Silva-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Silva 1997</LINK>). There is also evidence that increased suicidal tendencies are associated with abuse (<LINK REF="REF-Golding-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Golding 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Leone-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leone 2011</LINK>). Other signs of emotional distress associated with intimate partner abuse are self harm and parasuicide (<LINK REF="REF-Heath-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heath 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stark-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stark 1996</LINK>), sleep disturbances (<LINK REF="REF-Pigeon-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pigeon 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ratner-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ratner 1993</LINK>), chronic fatigue (<LINK REF="REF-Cerulli-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cerulli 2011</LINK>), and anxiety disorders (<LINK REF="REF-Cerulli-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cerulli 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ratner-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ratner 1993</LINK>). A Nicaraguan study reported that 70% of cases of emotional distress in women were a direct consequence of abuse (<LINK REF="REF-Ellsberg-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ellsberg 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>In industrialised countries, a further mental health problem associated with partner violence is the abuse of alcohol and drugs (<LINK REF="REF-Golding-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Golding 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Graham-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Graham 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McCauley-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">McCauley 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schumacher-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schumacher 2012</LINK>). Substance abuse and intimate partner abuse often occur simultaneously. Women who have experienced physical or psychological violence are 15 times more likely to abuse alcohol and 9 times more likely to abuse drugs than non-abused women (<LINK REF="REF-Stark-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stark 1996</LINK>). There is also evidence that alcohol and drug abuse in some women is directly attributable to intimate partner abuse (<LINK REF="REF-Golding-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Golding 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stark-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stark 1996</LINK>).</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">The impact of intimate partner abuse on health service usage</HEADING>
<P>Women experiencing intimate partner abuse present to health services very frequently and require wide-ranging medical services (<LINK REF="REF-Campbell-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Campbell 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Davidson-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davidson 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Plichta-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Plichta 2007</LINK>). They are admitted to hospital more often than non-abused women and are prescribed more medication (<LINK REF="REF-Kernic-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kernic 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wisner-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wisner 1999</LINK>), particularly analgesia (<LINK REF="REF-Lo-Fo-Wong-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lo Fo Wong 2007</LINK>). A Canadian study set in a hospital accident and emergency department showed that abused women access medical care three times more often than non-abused women (<LINK REF="REF-Ratner-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ratner 1993</LINK>). There is also evidence of a positive linear relationship between severity of abuse and the use of healthcare services (<LINK REF="REF-Koss-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Koss 1991</LINK>).</P>
<P>It is difficult to calculate the economic impact of intimate partner abuse, but the costs are high. The estimated total cost of domestic violence to the UK in monetary terms is GBP 23 billion per annum. This figure includes an estimated cost to the state of GBP 3.1 billion, a cost to employers of GBP 1.3 billion, and human suffering costs of GBP 17 billion (<LINK REF="REF-Walby-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walby 2004</LINK>). Likewise, studies looking at healthcare plans in the United States have found average healthcare costs to be significantly higher among abused compared with non-abused women (<LINK REF="REF-Bonomi-2009b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bonomi 2009b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jones-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jones 2006</LINK>). An Australian study estimated that in 2002 to 2003, the costs to the community were on the order of AUD 8.1 billion, with the main contributors being pain, suffering, and premature mortality (<LINK REF="REF-Access-Economics-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Access Economics 2004</LINK>). In an update to that study, <LINK REF="REF-NCRVWC-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">NCRVWC 2009</LINK> estimated that abuse of women resulted in a cost to the community of AUD 13.6 billion in 2009 to 2010 &#8212; again due mainly to pain, suffering, and premature mortality. Thus, in addition to the very serious individual health consequences associated with abuse, there are also wider economic implications for society.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Interventions to improve the health consequences for women who have experienced intimate partner abuse</HEADING>
<P>Interventions may be primary, secondary, or tertiary. In the context of intimate partner abuse, primary interventions are concerned with preventing the onset of abuse, secondary interventions aim to prevent further abuse, and tertiary interventions deal with the consequences of abuse once it has ceased. This review focuses on secondary and tertiary interventions.</P>
<P>A range of interventions to help abused women have been evaluated. These may be classified as interventions aimed directly at the women (such as the provision of advocacy or therapy) and those aimed at improving the response of the professionals with whom they come into contact (such as the introduction of screening protocols or the provision of education and training on intimate partner abuse). In order to have clear evidence about what professionals can do to safely and effectively decrease the impact of intimate partner abuse on women, all such interventions need to be evaluated. To this end, we are conducting a suite of systematic reviews evaluating the effectiveness of interventions to improve the health outcomes of women who have experienced intimate partner abuse. This review examines the effectiveness of individual advocacy interventions. Our review of programmes to screen women for intimate partner violence has already been published (<LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Doherty-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Doherty 2015</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Advocacy</HEADING>
<P>In the context of domestic violence services, advocacy is a term that varies within and between countries, depending on institutional settings and historical developments around the role of advocates (<LINK REF="REF-Feder-2006a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Feder 2006a</LINK>). Advocates, to whom women are often referred from doctors or other service providers, engage with abused women to empower them and liaise them with community services. In some health settings, they may also have a role in bringing about system change, catalysing increased recognition by clinicians of women experiencing abuse. For the purposes of this review we define the core activities of advocacy as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>providing legal, housing, and financial advice;</LI>
<LI>facilitating access to and use of community resources such as refuges or shelters, emergency housing, and psychological interventions;</LI>
<LI>giving safety planning advice; and</LI>
<LI>providing ongoing support and informal counselling.</LI>
</UL>
<P>A variety of advocates, including trained lay mentors, community, healthcare, and judicial service employees and volunteers, may deliver advocacy services for different time periods and at different intensities. Crisis or short-term advocacy is of brief duration and involves the advocate working with the abused woman for a limited period of time (although the woman may then be referred on to other more specialised agencies). The duration of such advocacy depends on the needs of the abused woman but generally can range from a single meeting up to about 12 hours (<LINK REF="REF-Metters-2009-_x005b_pers-comm_x005d_" TYPE="REFERENCE">Metters 2009 [pers comm]</LINK>). More intensive, long-term advocacy may involve weekly sessions for up to 12 months. We will explore the heterogeneous models of advocacy more deeply in the review itself, based on the descriptions of interventions in the primary studies.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2015-09-29 11:21:52 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Advocacy interventions are based around the concept of empowerment: talking through potential solutions with the woman rather than being prescriptive and telling her what she ought to do, helping the woman to achieve the goals she has set rather than being directive and setting the goals for her, and helping her to understand and make sense of the situation and her responses to it (<LINK REF="REF-Campbell-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Campbell 1993</LINK>).</P>
<P>The aims of advocacy programmes are multifaceted and may include helping abused women to access services, guiding them through the process of safety planning, and improving abused women's physical or psychological health. Advocacy may be offered as a stand-alone service or as part of a multi-component (and possibly multi-agency) intervention. Trials of complex multi-component interventions are of increasing importance because of the drive to provide the most cost-effective healthcare (<LINK REF="REF-Campbell-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Campbell 2000</LINK>). Proponents of multi-component interventions that include advocacy theorise that offering advocacy addresses an abused woman's immediate needs, which in turn allows her to be receptive to other interventions (such as psychotherapy or child care management).</P>

<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2015-09-04 15:19:24 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Women experiencing intimate partner abuse have frequent contact with clinicians (<LINK REF="REF-Campbell-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Campbell 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Davidson-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davidson 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Plichta-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Plichta 2007</LINK>) and consider it appropriate that they ask questions about such violence (<LINK REF="REF-Burge-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burge 2005</LINK>). They also identify healthcare professionals as potential sources of non-judgemental, non-directive support, as long as they demonstrate an appreciation for the complexity of intimate partner abuse (<LINK REF="REF-Feder-2006b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Feder 2006b</LINK>). Historically, however, the quality of care for women experiencing domestic violence has been poor worldwide (<LINK REF="REF-Colombini-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Colombini 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stark-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stark 1996</LINK>). Many clinicians agree that domestic violence is a healthcare issue, but often they are reluctant to ask about abuse or do not respond appropriately if women talk about it (<LINK REF="REF-Gerber-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gerber 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gutmanis-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gutmanis 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ramsay-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ramsay 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Taft-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Taft 2004</LINK>). Such ambivalence is attributed to a number of factors, but frequently cited reasons include perceived time constraints and a lack of knowledge on how to support these women (<LINK REF="REF-Hegarty-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hegarty 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Waalen-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Waalen 2000</LINK>). Offering abused women the opportunity to receive the services of a domestic violence advocate is one course of action that clinicians could easily initiate and which would circumvent the barriers they perceive to helping abused women. Other options include psychological interventions, refuge or shelter care without advocacy, or a basic first line response for healthcare professionals as recommended by the WHO (<LINK REF="REF-Feder-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Feder 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-2013b" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2013b</LINK>). Before recommending that clinicians who care for women experiencing intimate partner abuse initiate advocacy, however, it is first essential to establish the effectiveness of the interventions. The current review is an update of a review published in 2009 (<LINK REF="REF-Ramsay-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ramsay 2009</LINK>) and follows the same basic protocol (<LINK REF="REF-Ramsay-2005b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ramsay 2005b</LINK>); any revisions to this protocol are highlighted in the section '<LINK TAG="PRO_REV_DIFF" TYPE="SECTION">Differences between protocol and review</LINK>'.</P>

<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS MODIFIED="2015-09-04 15:20:02 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Women aged 15 years and over who have experienced intimate partner abuse. Eligible studies could recruit women in healthcare settings as well as any other settings (such as criminal justice facilities, refuges/shelters, domestic violence agencies) if these studies reported data on health outcomes and if the findings were potentially transferable (e.g. if referral to an external advocacy agency was a plausible action by a healthcare professional).</P>
</CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS MODIFIED="2015-09-04 15:22:56 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Any brief (less than 12 hours) or intensive (12 or more hours) advocacy intervention compared to no care or usual care.</P>
<P>Advocacy could be delivered either on an individual basis or in a group environment. We included studies if the intervention incorporated safety planning with the woman or facilitated access to and use of community resources, such as refuges or shelters, emergency housing, and psychological care. Provision of these services, either with or without ongoing informal support or counselling for the woman, was permissible. We also included studies where advocacy was evaluated as an adjunct to another intervention, such as the teaching of child management skills. In our earlier review we specified that multi-component intervention studies would only be included where advocacy was the sole difference between the two trial arms (e.g. both arms would receive intervention A, but only one arm would receive the second intervention of advocacy). For the present review, however, we also included trials evaluating multi-component interventions where advocacy plus some other form of intervention was compared with no care or usual care. The review team judged that this change was necessary given the increasing number of trials evaluating advocacy within the context of multi-component interventions.</P>
<P>Similarly, for this updated review we have also incorporated a more rigorous definition of 'usual care'. We have defined this as care typically offered in the study setting, with the condition that such care only includes a minimal element of advocacy (such as the provision of information cards or leaflets listing the addresses and telephone numbers of local support agencies), or, if more substantive advocacy is offered, then less than 20% of women in the control arm received such care. The review team judged that this change was necessary given the increasing use of advocacy as part of usual care.</P>

<P>We recognised that postintervention changes in some of these proxy measures may be associated with both positive and negative health outcomes for abused women and require careful interpretation.

For example, even many months after leaving an abusive relationship, a woman may be traumatised, and positive mental health effects may not be evident for some time. For the purposes of this review, we defined short-term follow-up as up to and including 12 months, medium-term follow-up as more than 12 and up to 24 months, and long-term follow-up as more than two years.</P>

Where mean changes and SDs were reported but the distribution was skewed (most likely because of the small sample size), we assumed a normal distribution and analysed the data accordingly. The majority of studies included in the review used a range of scales to measure similar outcomes, so we standardised the treatment effects for these outcomes by dividing the mean difference (MD) in postintervention scores or change from baseline scores for the intervention and control groups by the pooled SD of the outcome among participants, generating a standardised mean difference (SMD) with 95% CIs. For the few outcomes that were assessed using the same scale, we calculated the MD.

We tested four assumptions: that women who dropped out of the intervention would have improved outcomes while women who dropped out of the control arm would not; that women who dropped out from the intervention and control groups would both have improved outcomes; that women who dropped out of the intervention would not have improved outcomes while women who dropped out of the control arm would; and that neither women in the intervention nor in the control groups who dropped out would have improved outcomes.</P>

<P>Where comparable data were available, we planned to perform meta-analyses. The decision whether to pool data in this way was determined by the comparability of populations and interventions (clinical heterogeneity); the duration of follow-up (methodological heterogeneity); and the outcomes being used in the primary studies (see '<LINK TAG="HETEROGENEITY_ASSESSMENT" TYPE="SECTION">Assessment of heterogeneity</LINK>'). Where it was inappropriate to combine the data in a meta-analysis, we have presented the effect sizes and 95% CIs for individual outcomes in individual studies. Fixed-effect models were used in all analyses given that all meta-analyses were based on subsets of studies that were deemed clinically heterogeneous.</P>

<P>We ran initial searches in 2006 for a much wider 'scoping' review of the intervention literature around intimate partner abuse. For this broad search, we found approximately 17,700 records. One of the questions we addressed in the scoping review was whether women-centred interventions (advocacy, support groups, and psychological approaches) were effective in helping to improve the health and well-being of abused women and their children; we assessed 228 full papers in order to address this question. Of these, 10 RCTs (2 of which were quasi-RCTs; <LINK REF="STD-McFarlane-2000" TYPE="STUDY">McFarlane 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McFarlane-2006" TYPE="STUDY">McFarlane 2006</LINK>), reported in 18 articles, met inclusion criteria for this review.</P>
<P>We re-ran our searches in a more focused manner in July 2008, identifying a total of 1021 records. As a result of this search, we assessed the full text of two additional papers (both of which were subsequently excluded, one because it had no intervention and one because it considered HIV/STDs, with no separate data for abused women).</P>
<P>For the present update, we initially re-ran the searches in September 2011 and then again in March 2013 (with two databases being searched in June and August 2013), March 2014 (with two databases searched in April 2014), and April 2015. We found a total of 11,112 records. Sixty-two full-text articles were identified for further review, and of these, we selected five new RCTs for inclusion in the review. We also found three additional studies, but these are not included in this update because of unavailable subgroup data for <LINK REF="STD-Bair_x002d_Merritt-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Bair-Merritt 2010</LINK>, and unavailable data for <LINK REF="STD-Niolon-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Niolon 2009</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Prosman-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Prosman 2014</LINK>. All three studies are currently awaiting assessment (<LINK TAG="AWAITING_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Studies awaiting classification</LINK>).</P>
<P>Four potentially relevant but still ongoing studies have been identified since the original review (<LINK REF="STD-Lako-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Lako 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-NCT01207258" TYPE="STUDY">NCT01207258</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-NCT01661504" TYPE="STUDY">NCT01661504</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-NCT00465556" TYPE="STUDY">NCT00465556</LINK>), but data are not yet available for these.

Three studies were cluster-randomised (<LINK REF="STD-McFarlane-2000" TYPE="STUDY">McFarlane 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McFarlane-2006" TYPE="STUDY">McFarlane 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Taft-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Taft 2011</LINK>). McFarlane and colleagues used a method whereby the weeks or months were randomly allocated to intervention and control, and then the women were allocated according to the month (<LINK REF="STD-McFarlane-2000" TYPE="STUDY">McFarlane 2000</LINK>) or week (<LINK REF="STD-McFarlane-2006" TYPE="STUDY">McFarlane 2006</LINK>) they presented to a healthcare facility, while <LINK REF="STD-Taft-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Taft 2011</LINK> used the site as the unit of randomisation.

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Recruitment</HEADING>
<P>Eight of the studies recruited women in healthcare settings (<LINK REF="STD-Cripe-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Cripe 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gillum-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Gillum 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hyman-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Hyman 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kiely-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Kiely 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McFarlane-2000" TYPE="STUDY">McFarlane 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McFarlane-2006" TYPE="STUDY">McFarlane 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Taft-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Taft 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tiwari-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Tiwari 2005</LINK>), and three in domestic violence shelters (<LINK REF="STD-Constantino-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Constantino 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sullivan-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Sullivan 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sullivan-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Sullivan 1992</LINK>). One recruited participants primarily from domestic violence shelters but also from social and family service agencies (<LINK REF="STD-Sullivan-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Sullivan 2002</LINK>) and one primarily from a community centre serving a large urban population (<LINK REF="STD-Tiwari-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Tiwari 2010</LINK>). It is possible that women recruited in healthcare settings differ from those recruited elsewhere, as they may not yet be ready to accept help (<LINK REF="REF-Zink-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zink 2004</LINK>). One study recruited additional participants after the initial six-month follow-up period (<LINK REF="STD-Sullivan-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Sullivan 1992</LINK>), raising the number of recruited women from 146 at the outset of the study to a total of 283 at the two-year follow-up. However, investigators' report of the three-year follow-up data was based only on the original sample.</P>
<P>The papers did not always explicitly state the severity of the abuse experienced by participants, but for the most part, it could be inferred from the study setting or the mean baseline abuse scores. For the four trials recruiting women either exclusively or primarily from domestic violence shelters (<LINK REF="STD-Constantino-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Constantino 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sullivan-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Sullivan 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sullivan-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Sullivan 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sullivan-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Sullivan 2002</LINK>), it is likely that the women had experienced relatively severe abuse; mean baseline abuse scores, available for two of the studies, support this (<LINK REF="STD-Sullivan-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Sullivan 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sullivan-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Sullivan 1992</LINK>). For the eight studies recruiting participants in healthcare settings, the severity of the abuse varied. In <LINK REF="STD-Hyman-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Hyman 2001</LINK>, which was set in a hospital emergency department, 90% of participants reported having been physically or sexually assaulted, 93% were experiencing ongoing abuse, and 68% had received previous medical treatment for injuries. The severity of abuse experienced by participants at study entry in the remaining healthcare trials (based in antenatal, primary care/public health, mother and child clinics, and GP practices) was mostly less severe. Mean baseline scores indicated that women experienced moderately severe physical and psychological abuse at study entry in three studies (<LINK REF="STD-McFarlane-2000" TYPE="STUDY">McFarlane 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McFarlane-2006" TYPE="STUDY">McFarlane 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Taft-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Taft 2011</LINK>), while in <LINK REF="STD-Cripe-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Cripe 2010</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Tiwari-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Tiwari 2005</LINK>, participants reported moderate-to-severe psychological abuse, but less severe levels of physical and sexual abuse. In <LINK REF="STD-Kiely-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Kiely 2010</LINK>, instances of minor abuse were common, but 55% of the women had also experienced severe abuse. In <LINK REF="STD-Gillum-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Gillum 2009</LINK>, one-third of the participants met the criteria for being in lethal danger. In the one study set in the community, the most prevalent form of abuse was psychological aggression (on average, 19 events per woman), although a minority of women had also been physically assaulted or sexually coerced (<LINK REF="STD-Tiwari-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Tiwari 2010</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Participants</HEADING>
<P>A total of 2141 abused participants took part in the trials. Most of these women (n = 1297; 61%) were recruited because they were experiencing current (within the last 12 months) physical or sexual abuse. Seven studies extended inclusion beyond this to also include women experiencing emotional or non-physical abuse (<LINK REF="STD-Constantino-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Constantino 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cripe-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Cripe 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gillum-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Gillum 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hyman-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Hyman 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Taft-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Taft 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tiwari-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Tiwari 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tiwari-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Tiwari 2010</LINK>). Many of the participants were living with or still intimately involved with the perpetrator at study entry. However, there were exceptions to this. In <LINK REF="STD-Sullivan-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Sullivan 2002</LINK>, 79% of the women were no longer involved with the abusive partner. In four other studies, it was not clear how many of the women were still intimately involved with the abuser at recruitment (<LINK REF="STD-Constantino-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Constantino 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cripe-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Cripe 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gillum-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Gillum 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kiely-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Kiely 2010</LINK>). The ages of the women recruited ranged from 15 to 65 years, although more usually the women were aged between 24 and 45 years old. The ethnicity of the samples varied across trials. Seven studies included a mix of whites, African Americans and Latinas, with two of the studies considering the possible effects of acculturation (<LINK REF="STD-McFarlane-2006" TYPE="STUDY">McFarlane 2006</LINK>) and race (<LINK REF="STD-Sullivan-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Sullivan 1992</LINK>) on outcomes at three year follow-up. Four trials involved single ethnic groups, including a study reporting on Latina women (<LINK REF="STD-McFarlane-2000" TYPE="STUDY">McFarlane 2000</LINK>), one recruiting African American women (<LINK REF="STD-Kiely-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Kiely 2010</LINK>), and two studies conducted in Hong Kong in which all participants were Chinese (<LINK REF="STD-Tiwari-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Tiwari 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tiwari-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Tiwari 2010</LINK>). A further trial predominantly (87%) recruited women identifying their ethnicity as Mestizo (<LINK REF="STD-Cripe-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Cripe 2010</LINK>). One study, set in Australia, stated that 17% of those recruited to the intervention arm and 7% of those recruited to the control arm were born in Vietnam, and 17% and 32% in the intervention and control arms, respectively, were born in other countries outside Australia (<LINK REF="STD-Taft-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Taft 2011</LINK>). The socioeconomic status of participants was mixed, but most of the women were on low incomes, and few had university studies. Only in two studies did a reasonably high proportion of the women either have a university education (<LINK REF="STD-Hyman-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Hyman 2001</LINK>) or an income that was above average for the country (<LINK REF="STD-Tiwari-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Tiwari 2005</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Interventions</HEADING>
<P>The models of advocacy employed in the trials were heterogeneous.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Content</HEADING>
<P>The papers did not always explicitly state the theoretical framework underlying each intervention. However, in general, the advocacy provided to the participants was based on the concept of empowerment and included education, advice on safety and accessing resources, and empathic support. All of the interventions were pragmatic in that they provided tailored services to meet the wants and needs of the individual women. Some used the term 'counselling', 'supportive listening' or 'peer counselling' to describe facilitation of access to resources. Thus, <LINK REF="STD-Gillum-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Gillum 2009</LINK> gave resource information to participants in the control arm, while advocates actively helped to engage women in the intervention group with resources as part of an intervention, thus fitting our criteria.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Tiwari-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Tiwari 2010</LINK> used an empowerment intervention with a complementary focus on accessing resources. Authors explicitly stated, "The aim of empowerment training is to increase women&#8217;s safety through the recognition of increased danger, paired with a safety plan developed for individual use. In addition, it provides information about the cycle of violence, facts, and options regarding partner violence, legal protection orders, filing for criminal charges, and community resources for abused women." Thus, this multi-component, heterogeneous intervention entailed resource identification and facilitated their access to women in the intervention arm, hence fulfilling our inclusion criteria.</P>
<P>One of the studies evaluated a group intervention that allowed for participant-participant interaction, as well as interaction between the intervention participants and the advocate (<LINK REF="STD-Constantino-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Constantino 2005</LINK>). Authors labelled this a 'social support intervention'. However, there was no structured psychological intervention, and the intervention focused on accessing community resources, including information on resources and hours of operation for those resources when available. It therefore fits our inclusion criteria. Three trials included components in addition to advocacy that may have impacted the outcomes reported. The first of these included advocacy and education/support for all the children of mothers who had been abused (<LINK REF="STD-Sullivan-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Sullivan 2002</LINK>), while the second provided parenting support to all the abused mothers (<LINK REF="STD-Taft-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Taft 2011</LINK>). The third study was more complex, providing advocacy within the context of three possible further (and separate) interventions, depending on the abused woman's risk profile: cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) if depression was a risk, and smoking cessation/reduction sessions if smoking or environmental tobacco smoke exposure were identified risks (<LINK REF="STD-Kiely-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Kiely 2010</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Advocates</HEADING>
<P>Trained advocates administered all of the interventions, though there was some variability in their professional status. A professional advocate led one of the interventions (<LINK REF="STD-Hyman-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Hyman 2001</LINK>), research nurses administered three others (<LINK REF="STD-Constantino-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Constantino 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McFarlane-2006" TYPE="STUDY">McFarlane 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tiwari-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Tiwari 2005</LINK>), social workers and psychologists provided three others (<LINK REF="STD-Cripe-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Cripe 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kiely-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Kiely 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tiwari-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Tiwari 2010</LINK>), and trained paraprofessional students an additional three (<LINK REF="STD-Sullivan-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Sullivan 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sullivan-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Sullivan 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sullivan-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Sullivan 2002</LINK>). One study provided a mixture of face-to-face advocacy with the study investigators plus telephone support from trained community health workers (<LINK REF="STD-Gillum-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Gillum 2009</LINK>). Two studies were somewhat different in that they evaluated the effectiveness of advocacy provided by 'mentor mothers'. In the first of these, the services of a trained, non-professional 'mentor mother' supplemented advocacy by a professional advocate (<LINK REF="STD-McFarlane-2000" TYPE="STUDY">McFarlane 2000</LINK>), while in the second, trained, non-professional 'mentor mothers' provided the entirety of the intervention (<LINK REF="STD-Taft-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Taft 2011</LINK>). With one exception, all of the interventions assessed were new and non-established modes of care within the study settings. The exception to this was a trial that evaluated two modes of interventions already in regular use in an emergency room (<LINK REF="STD-Hyman-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Hyman 2001</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Duration</HEADING>
<P>The duration of the interventions varied considerably and, to a large extent, was related to the settings in which the women were recruited.</P>
<P>In general, the interventions described in studies outside of healthcare settings were longer, both in terms of the length of the sessions and the period over which the sessions were offered. Typically, these types of interventions took place over a period of two to four months, providing advocacy for respective totals of about 12 hours (<LINK REF="STD-Constantino-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Constantino 2005</LINK>), 43 hours plus an additional 80 hours provided to the children (<LINK REF="STD-Sullivan-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Sullivan 2002</LINK>), and 60 to 80 hours (<LINK REF="STD-Sullivan-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Sullivan 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sullivan-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Sullivan 1992</LINK>). The one exception is the study that recruited women within a community centre setting (<LINK REF="STD-Tiwari-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Tiwari 2010</LINK>); an initial face-to-face session (lasting about 30 minutes) was followed by 12 weeks of telephone advocacy (about 10 to 20 minutes per call) for an accumulated total of 2.5 to 4.5 hours of advocacy.</P>
<P>Most interventions recruiting women in healthcare settings were relatively brief. Three interventions were one-off sessions and lasted from 20 to 30 minutes (<LINK REF="STD-Tiwari-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Tiwari 2005</LINK>), about 30 minutes (<LINK REF="STD-Cripe-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Cripe 2010</LINK>), and 90 minutes (<LINK REF="STD-Hyman-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Hyman 2001</LINK>). Four other trials offered advocacy sessions over a prolonged period but were still of brief duration overall. In the first of these, women were recruited in antenatal clinics and offered advocacy (or advocacy plus the services of a 'mentor mother') until the time of their delivery (<LINK REF="STD-McFarlane-2000" TYPE="STUDY">McFarlane 2000</LINK>). The authors report that most sessions lasted about 30 minutes, with women averaging four to five sessions for an accumulated total of approximately 150 minutes of advocacy (McFarlane 2007 [pers comm]). In the second study, women received five separate 20-minute interventions, each six months apart, for a total of approximately 100 minutes of advocacy (<LINK REF="STD-McFarlane-2006" TYPE="STUDY">McFarlane 2006</LINK>). The third trial provided one face-to-face session lasting about 30 minutes, followed by six telephone calls over a three-month period, each lasting an average of 20 minutes (range 5 to 60 minutes) (Woods 2013 [pers comm] in <LINK REF="STD-Gillum-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Gillum 2009</LINK>). We assessed this intervention as being approximately 2.5 hours long. In the fourth study, advocacy for abuse (and where applicable, therapy for depression and smoking/passive smoking) was provided at four to eight prenatal sessions and two postpartum booster sessions (<LINK REF="STD-Kiely-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Kiely 2010</LINK>). Depending on how many of the four risks were addressed, each session lasted 50  15 minutes, for a total of 3.5 to 8 hours of advocacy. The one study recruiting in healthcare clinics that was of longer duration was conducted in Australia (<LINK REF="STD-Taft-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Taft 2011</LINK>). The total duration of this intervention is not specified in the paper, but abused women were offered a minimum of one hours' advocacy each week for 12 months, for at least 52 total hours of advocacy.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Range of control conditions</HEADING>
<P>Control conditions also varied. One study compared the intervention with usual shelter care and unstructured chats with the principal investigator (<LINK REF="STD-Constantino-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Constantino 2005</LINK>).

Many of our included studies (10 out of 13) satisfied at least four criteria; however, some of these did not provide enough data for us to evaluate some of their other potential biases, so overall, we judged 5 of the 13 studies to be at high risk of bias.</P>
<P>We judged one trial to be at low risk of bias on all eight criteria (<LINK REF="STD-Tiwari-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Tiwari 2005</LINK>) and another study by the same author to be at low risk on seven criteria and unclear on one (<LINK REF="STD-Tiwari-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Tiwari 2010</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Kiely-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Kiely 2010</LINK> was at low risk of bias on six criteria and unclear on two.

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Sequence generation</HEADING>
<P>All 13 studies described treatment allocation as random, but only 6 trials provided sufficient information on sequence generation: one study reported using random numbers tables to allocate participants (<LINK REF="STD-Hyman-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Hyman 2001</LINK>), one study wrote the allocations on pieces of paper placed in envelopes that were subsequently shuffled (<LINK REF="STD-Gillum-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Gillum 2009</LINK>), and four studies stated that they used a computer-generated method (<LINK REF="STD-Kiely-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Kiely 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McFarlane-2006" TYPE="STUDY">McFarlane 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tiwari-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Tiwari 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tiwari-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Tiwari 2010</LINK>). Six studies either made no reference to sequence generation or provided insufficient details, so we rated their risk of bias as unclear.</P>
<P>In the cluster-randomised trial by <LINK REF="STD-Taft-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Taft 2011</LINK>, a large percentage of clinics did not refer any potential participants to either arm, hence we rated this study as having selection bias.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Allocation concealment</HEADING>
<P>Only five trials provided sufficient information and fulfilled the requirement of allocation concealment. Four of these reported that the allocations were placed in sealed envelopes (<LINK REF="STD-Gillum-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Gillum 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sullivan-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Sullivan 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tiwari-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Tiwari 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tiwari-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Tiwari 2010</LINK>), and in the fifth study, the recruiters had to telephone a co-ordinating centre (<LINK REF="STD-Kiely-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Kiely 2010</LINK>). Three trials did not have any allocation concealment, so we rated their risk of bias as high. Two of these studies randomised women to intervention and control groups according to the week (<LINK REF="STD-McFarlane-2006" TYPE="STUDY">McFarlane 2006</LINK>) or month (<LINK REF="STD-McFarlane-2000" TYPE="STUDY">McFarlane 2000</LINK>) they attended a clinic; for the third study, the investigators maintained allocation concealment at the time of randomisation, but thereafter clinic staff were aware of their intervention status (<LINK REF="STD-Taft-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Taft 2011</LINK>). None of the five remaining studies made reference to allocation concealment, so we judged them to be at unclear risk of bias.</P>

<P>Blinding participants or those delivering advocacy interventions is not feasible.</P>
<P>Five of the trials provided details of the measures taken to ensure blinded assessment of the primary outcomes. Four of these studies provided explicit details on blinding: <LINK REF="STD-Hyman-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Hyman 2001</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Kiely-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Kiely 2010</LINK> each stated that the researchers did not have any information about randomisation status, while <LINK REF="STD-Tiwari-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Tiwari 2005</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Tiwari-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Tiwari 2010</LINK> stated that the researchers did not become aware of the women's randomisation status until after collecting all follow-up data, when the women started answering questions about their satisfaction with the care. The fifth trial did not explicitly assert the extent of blinded assessment, but we thought it was satisfactory on the basis of statements in the paper, which remarked that the postintervention interviewers were different to the interviewers who collected baseline data and provided the intervention (<LINK REF="STD-Cripe-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Cripe 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>There was no blinded assessment in four of the trials. <LINK REF="STD-Sullivan-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Sullivan 1991</LINK> stated that the follow-up interviews with women who received advocacy were longer and included questions about the programme, thus the researchers must have been aware of the women's randomisation status. <LINK REF="STD-McFarlane-2006" TYPE="STUDY">McFarlane 2006</LINK> stated that budget limitations precluded the use of blinding, and <LINK REF="STD-Taft-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Taft 2011</LINK> stated that the outcome assessors were not blinded, as they had also negotiated informed consent and fully briefed participants about the mentoring programme. Similarly, in <LINK REF="STD-Gillum-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Gillum 2009</LINK>, the outcome assessors could not have been blinded as they also collected baseline data and provided an initial face-to-face counselling session for women in the intervention group. The other four studies did not provide sufficient explicit information to enable a judgement on the blinding of assessors, so we judged them to be at unclear risk of detection bias.</P>

In 11 of the remaining 12 trials, losses to follow-up ranged from 2.5% in <LINK REF="STD-Sullivan-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Sullivan 2002</LINK> to 27% in <LINK REF="STD-Taft-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Taft 2011</LINK>. One trial reported a higher loss of 48% of its recruited sample, so these results need to be interpreted with caution (<LINK REF="STD-Hyman-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Hyman 2001</LINK>). We judged six of the trials to have a low risk of attrition bias (<LINK REF="STD-Cripe-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Cripe 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gillum-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Gillum 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McFarlane-2006" TYPE="STUDY">McFarlane 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sullivan-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Sullivan 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tiwari-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Tiwari 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tiwari-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Tiwari 2010</LINK>). However, five studies carried a high risk of bias (<LINK REF="STD-Constantino-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Constantino 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hyman-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Hyman 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sullivan-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Sullivan 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sullivan-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Sullivan 1992</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Taft-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Taft 2011</LINK>). In two cases, and although investigators provided reasons for attrition, group allocation might have had an effect on dropout (<LINK REF="STD-Constantino-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Constantino 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hyman-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Hyman 2001</LINK>). We had difficulty in assessing the significance of attrition in <LINK REF="STD-Sullivan-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Sullivan 1991</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Sullivan-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Sullivan 1992</LINK>. In the former, there was a large difference in attrition between groups. This was accounted for by participants becoming 'ineligible', as they had to receive at least three weeks of services and had dropped out (three because they had returned to their abusers). This may have influenced the effect sizes of outcomes. However, we note that the poor attrition is a function of the study design, where women had to attend at least three advocacy sessions to be eligible, a condition which could not apply to women allocated to the control group. Similar arguments also apply to <LINK REF="STD-Sullivan-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Sullivan 1992</LINK>. Finally, two trials reported testing to see whether attrition had a potential effect on results (<LINK REF="STD-Kiely-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Kiely 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McFarlane-2000" TYPE="STUDY">McFarlane 2000</LINK>). Neither study reported any significant differences, but they did not report sufficient details about the reasons for attrition or if its relation to group allocation, so we judged the risk of attrition bias to be unclear.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Baseline measurement of outcomes</HEADING>
<P>We assessed reporting of baseline measurement of outcomes in all the reviewed studies. In seven, the study investigators stated that there were no substantive between-group differences in outcome measures at baseline (<LINK REF="STD-Cripe-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Cripe 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gillum-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Gillum 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kiely-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Kiely 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McFarlane-2000" TYPE="STUDY">McFarlane 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sullivan-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Sullivan 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sullivan-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Sullivan 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tiwari-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Tiwari 2010</LINK> ), while an eighth study stated that there were no between-group differences for their larger sample, but they did not provide information in relation to their original sample (<LINK REF="STD-Sullivan-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Sullivan 1992</LINK>). Five of the trials did not explicitly state that there were no baseline differences between groups, but they did report (or we were able to obtain) means and standard deviations, and these looked comparable (<LINK REF="STD-Constantino-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Constantino 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hyman-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Hyman 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McFarlane-2006" TYPE="STUDY">McFarlane 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Taft-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Taft 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tiwari-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Tiwari 2005</LINK>), so we rated them as also fulfilling this criterion.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Reliable primary outcome measures</HEADING>
<P>All studies measured multiple outcomes.

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Protection against contamination</HEADING>
<P>In 10 studies, the women were the unit of randomisation. One of these studies reported taking multiple steps to counter possible contamination; these included minimising opportunities for participants in the different groups to meet or share intervention materials, not recording a woman's allocation status in her medical record, and not allowing outcome assessors to be involved in the study design or provision of care (<LINK REF="STD-Tiwari-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Tiwari 2005</LINK>). One study reported some contamination, and approximately 19% of women in the intervention group received control group care, while about 23% of women allocated to the control arm received the intervention (<LINK REF="STD-Hyman-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Hyman 2001</LINK>). Another trial was also at high risk of contamination: the study was conducted in a clinic serving a relatively small population, so contact between the women was possible. Moreover, the interventionists had at least some contact with the control group participants (<LINK REF="STD-Gillum-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Gillum 2009</LINK>). In the other seven studies that randomised women on an individual basis, women in different arms of the trial may have communicated with each other, so we rated these studies at unclear risk of bias on this domain (<LINK REF="STD-Constantino-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Constantino 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cripe-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Cripe 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kiely-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Kiely 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sullivan-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Sullivan 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sullivan-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Sullivan 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sullivan-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Sullivan 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tiwari-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Tiwari 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>Three studies randomised participants on a non-individual basis. Two studies by McFarlane and colleagues randomised women according to the week (<LINK REF="STD-McFarlane-2006" TYPE="STUDY">McFarlane 2006</LINK>) or month (<LINK REF="STD-McFarlane-2000" TYPE="STUDY">McFarlane 2000</LINK>) they presented to the healthcare facility (weeks and months were randomly allocated to the intervention or control group). <LINK REF="STD-McFarlane-2000" TYPE="STUDY">McFarlane 2000</LINK> had a design that may have minimised potential contamination; women in the different trial arms were unlikely to come into personal contact with each other, and different individuals provided the treatments. However, in <LINK REF="STD-McFarlane-2006" TYPE="STUDY">McFarlane 2006</LINK>, the change in allocation status was much shorter, and the same healthcare professionals managed both groups, so there was more potential for the control group to receive elements of the intervention accidentally. We rated this study to be at high risk of bias. The final study employed cluster-randomisation (<LINK REF="STD-Taft-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Taft 2011</LINK>) and thus was designed to protect against contamination.</P>

<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS MODIFIED="2015-11-10 17:28:09 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Our synthesis of the outcome data is primarily narrative. The 13 studies tracked a wide range of 25 outcome measures, though several of the studies used some of the same outcomes. Ultimately, however, we were only able to perform a limited number of meta-analyses because of problems with the reported data. The first problem was the clinical heterogeneity across the studies in relation to differences in the intensity of the advocacy interventions provided. For example, we felt that we could not combine studies that tested 'intensive' interventions (i.e. 12 or more hours of advocacy) with those using 'brief' interventions (e.g. less than 12 hours duration). This substantially reduced the number of studies amenable to pooling. A second problem was that a number of the outcomes were measured in different ways, so we could not compare them. For example, some studies reported a total score for an outcome, while others reported only the subscale totals of different measures. This further reduced our ability to pool studies.</P>
<P>Trials did not always report outcome data in a form that we could use in the review. In total, we contacted and obtained further unpublished data from eight of the study authors (<LINK REF="STD-Constantino-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Constantino 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gillum-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Gillum 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hyman-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Hyman 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kiely-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Kiely 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sullivan-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Sullivan 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sullivan-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Sullivan 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Taft-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Taft 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tiwari-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Tiwari 2005</LINK>). One author (<LINK REF="STD-Cripe-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Cripe 2010</LINK>) was unable to send us additional unpublished data. In order to allow for comparison across the studies, two of the review authors (JR and either CR or DD for the original review; or JR and CR for the updated review) independently recalculated all effects sizes. We have highlighted where our calculated unadjusted effect sizes are markedly different from the findings reported by the study investigators. We based all analyses on postintervention scores except for three studies, where changes from baseline data were available for some or all of the outcomes measured (these are differentiated in the forest plots by 'mean change scores') (<LINK REF="STD-Cripe-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Cripe 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Constantino-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Constantino 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tiwari-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Tiwari 2005</LINK>). In <LINK REF="STD-Cripe-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Cripe 2010</LINK>, we corrected for differences in the direction of mean change by multiplying the reported mean change scores by &#8722; 1. For the one cluster-randomised trial (<LINK REF="STD-Taft-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Taft 2011</LINK>), the study authors provided us with design effect sizes for each of the individual outcomes adjusted for clustering (design effects were minimal, ranging from 0.86 to 1.12). Where investigators reported multiple follow-ups within our three follow-up categories, unless stated otherwise, we chose to report the results from the latest follow-up in all comparison analyses. For example, if data were reported at 2, 6, and 12 months follow-up, we selected the data at 12 months.</P>
<P>Two of the studies recruited both abused and non-abused women. These either reported on the subset of abused women only (<LINK REF="STD-Kiely-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Kiely 2010</LINK>), or we obtained separate data for the subset of abused women from the study authors (<LINK REF="STD-Taft-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Taft 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>Finally, one of the studies continued to recruit participants after taking baseline measurements (<LINK REF="STD-Sullivan-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Sullivan 1992</LINK>). For this study, where follow-up data were available for both the original and the expanded samples of participants, we calculated effect sizes based on the latter. In general, the effect sizes for outcomes at up to 12 months and 12 to 24 months follow-up were calculated on the larger sample of participants. The two exceptions to this both related to dichotomous measures of physical abuse and emotional abuse as measured at up to 12 months follow-up. All effect sizes for outcomes measured at 24 + months follow-up were based on the original, smaller sample of participants.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Physical abuse</HEADING>
<P>Eight studies measured physical abuse; six of these evaluated brief advocacy interventions (<LINK REF="STD-Gillum-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Gillum 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kiely-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Kiely 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McFarlane-2000" TYPE="STUDY">McFarlane 2000</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-McFarlane-2006" TYPE="STUDY">McFarlane 2006</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Tiwari-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Tiwari 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tiwari-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Tiwari 2010</LINK>), while the other two appraised intensive interventions (<LINK REF="STD-Sullivan-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Sullivan 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sullivan-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Sullivan 1992</LINK>). One study measured both severe and minor physical violence separately (<LINK REF="STD-Tiwari-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Tiwari 2005</LINK>); this study was also different from the others in that it assessed mean change from baseline. One of the studies employed a composite measure of physical and sexual abuse, but we were able to obtain separate data for each of these (<LINK REF="STD-Kiely-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Kiely 2010</LINK>). We obtained additional statistical data from four study investigators (<LINK REF="STD-Gillum-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Gillum 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kiely-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Kiely 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sullivan-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Sullivan 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tiwari-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Tiwari 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>We calculated effect sizes for five of the six studies that offered brief advocacy. As indicated (see <LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK> in '<LINK TAG="ANALYSES_AND_DATA" TYPE="SECTION">Data and analyses</LINK>'), there was no evidence that advocacy leads to a reduction in physical abuse when this outcome is expressed using a continuous measure. Pooled data from three studies (n = 558)&#8212; two recruiting women in healthcare settings (<LINK REF="STD-Gillum-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Gillum 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McFarlane-2006" TYPE="STUDY">McFarlane 2006</LINK>) and the other from a community centre (<LINK REF="STD-Tiwari-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Tiwari 2010</LINK>)&#8212;showed no effect of advocacy in the short-term, that is, at up to 12 months follow-up (SMD 0.00, 95% CI &#8722; 0.17 to 0.16, I = 0%; moderate quality evidence). Similarly, there was no effect in the medium term (SMD &#8722; 0.02, 95% CI &#8722; 0.24 to 0.19; n = 319) when <LINK REF="STD-McFarlane-2006" TYPE="STUDY">McFarlane 2006</LINK> followed up women 24 months after the first intervention session (with sessions being provided thereafter every six months for up to two years). However, this pattern of results did not extend to <LINK REF="STD-Kiely-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Kiely 2010</LINK>, the only trial that employed a dichotomous measure of physical abuse (<LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>). In this multi-component study, recruiting within an antenatal setting, women who received advocacy (and possibly also cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), therapy for smoking/passive smoking, or both) were less likely to be experiencing physical abuse at the end of the intervention period (OR 0.42, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.75; n = 306). This means that one in every eight women that is given advocacy is likely to benefit from it (number needed to treat (NNT) = 8). Findings were more equivocal in the study that measured severe and minor abuse in pregnant women attending for antenatal care (<LINK REF="STD-Tiwari-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Tiwari 2005</LINK>). In this study, which had a low risk of bias, a brief 30-minute session of advocacy was not associated with any reduction in severe abuse as measured at 16 to 34 weeks postintervention (change-score MD 0.08, 95% CI &#8722; 0.26 to 0.42; n = 110; not statistically significant; moderate quality evidence), but investigators did observe a reduction in minor abuse (change-score MD &#8722; 1.00, 95% CI &#8722; 1.82 to &#8722; 0.18; n = 110; <LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>). The fifth trial that offered brief advocacy did not report any standard deviations, nor were these (or alternative relevant data) available from the authors (<LINK REF="STD-McFarlane-2000" TYPE="STUDY">McFarlane 2000</LINK>). However, in their paper, the study authors reported finding no evidence to suggest that advocacy (or advocacy plus the services of a 'mentor mother') reduced physical abuse in women recruited from antenatal clinics, either in the short or medium term.</P>
<P>Two studies, both recruiting women departing from domestic violence shelters, assessed the effectiveness of intensive advocacy. <LINK REF="STD-Sullivan-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Sullivan 1992</LINK> measured physical abuse using both continuous and dichotomous measures, while <LINK REF="STD-Sullivan-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Sullivan 1991</LINK> assessed this outcome using only a dichotomous measure. In the study that employed a continuous measure of physical abuse (<LINK REF="CMP-001.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.4</LINK>), there was no evidence to confirm or refute the hypothesis that advocacy leads to a reduction in severe physical abuse at 12 months follow-up (MD &#8722; 0.12, 95% CI &#8722; 0.39 to 0.15; n = 265; low quality evidence) or at three years (MD 0.18, 95% CI &#8722; 0.20 to 0.56; n = 124). However, at the two-year follow-up, trialists reported that women who received advocacy experienced significantly less physical abuse than women in the control arm (MD &#8722; 0.25, 95% CI &#8722; 0.50 to 0.00; n = 265). A similar pattern of results also emerged with the dichotomous data (<LINK REF="CMP-001.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.5</LINK>). Two studies contributed to a meta-analysis of the 12-month follow-up data (<LINK REF="STD-Sullivan-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Sullivan 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sullivan-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Sullivan 1992</LINK>); there was no evidence that advocacy reduced physical abuse (OR 0.61, 95% CI 0.33 to 1.14, I = 0%; n = 182; very low quality evidence) with the NNT being eight women for one to benefit (<LINK REF="CMP-001.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.5</LINK>). At later follow-up points, when data were only available for the <LINK REF="STD-Sullivan-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Sullivan 1992</LINK> study, the findings suggest that participants who received advocacy experienced significantly less physical abuse than women in the control arm (OR 0.39, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.77; n = 265) at 12 to 24 months follow-up, again with an NNT of eight, but at three years, the study did not find any benefit of advocacy (OR 1.07, 95% CI 0.52 to 2.23) (the NNT for one woman to benefit was 63).</P>
<P>Best case and worst case scenario analyses estimated the effects of missing data on the results of one meta-analysis (<LINK REF="CMP-001.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.6</LINK>). For the 12-month follow-up data, the results did not change when imputing an improved outcome for intervention women who dropped out of the study (no control group women dropped out) (OR 0.54, 95% CI 0.29 to 1.01, I = 0%; n = 192), or when imputing a poor outcome (OR 0.83, 95% CI 0.46 to 1.49, I = 0%; n = 192).</P>
<P>For descriptive purposes only, two forest plots outline evidence for the effectiveness of any type of advocacy (brief or intensive) on physical abuse, as assessed using a continuous measure (<LINK REF="CMP-001.07" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.7</LINK>) and a dichotomous measure (<LINK REF="CMP-001.08" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.8</LINK>).</P>
<P>There is insufficient evidence at present to draw unequivocal conclusions about the benefits of advocacy, either within healthcare settings or within the community, for the reduction of severe physical abuse. One study with low risk of bias suggests that brief advocacy may benefit women suffering minor abuse, but most studies did not measure minor abuse. One further study evaluating brief advocacy within the context of a multi-component intervention showed a positive effect immediately upon completion, but there was no long-term follow-up, and it is not clear if the other components (in particular, CBT for depression) also had an impact. It is possible that intensive advocacy can reduce physical abuse one to two years after the intervention but that this effect wanes over time. The primary studies are underpowered (two of the eight trials were pilot studies), and we could only pool data from three brief interventions and two intensive interventions. The meta-analyses were still underpowered, with relatively wide CIs.</P>

As shown in <LINK REF="CMP-003.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.1</LINK>, the individual study results were inconsistent at up to 12 months follow-up, but the pooled point estimate indicates that there was no significant reduction in emotional abuse (SMD &#8722; 0.05, 95% CI &#8722; 0.22 to 0.11, I = 51%; n = 558; low quality evidence) following the delivery of advocacy. <LINK REF="STD-McFarlane-2006" TYPE="STUDY">McFarlane 2006</LINK> also followed up on participants 24 months after the first intervention session (with subsequent sessions being provided every six months); again there was no significant benefit associated with the receipt of advocacy (SMD &#8722; 0.06, 95% CI &#8722; 0.28 to 0.16; n = 319; <LINK REF="CMP-003.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.1</LINK>). In contrast, the antenatal-based study by <LINK REF="STD-Tiwari-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Tiwari 2005</LINK> reported a statistically significant reduction in emotional abuse at 16 to 34 weeks after receipt of a single, brief session of advocacy (change-score MD &#8722; 4.24, 95% CI &#8722; 6.42 to &#8722; 2.06; n = 110; moderate quality evidence; <LINK REF="CMP-003.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.2</LINK>). The fifth trial did not report any standard deviations, nor were these (or alternative relevant data) available from the authors (<LINK REF="STD-McFarlane-2000" TYPE="STUDY">McFarlane 2000</LINK>). In the published paper, however, the authors reported that their analyses showed no evidence that multiple, brief sessions of advocacy (or advocacy plus the services of a 'mentor mother') reduced emotional abuse for women recruited in an antenatal setting, in the short or medium term.</P>
<P>The one study that provided intensive advocacy to women leaving shelters, <LINK REF="STD-Sullivan-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Sullivan 1992</LINK>, did not show any significant reduction in emotional abuse at 12 months postintervention&#8212;either when this was assessed using a continuous measure (MD &#8722; 0.02, 95% CI &#8722; 0.16 to 0.12; n = 265; very low quality evidence; <LINK REF="CMP-003.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.3</LINK>) or using a dichotomous measure (OR 0.58, 95% CI 0.30 to 1.13; n = 141; moderate quality evidence; <LINK REF="CMP-003.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.4</LINK>). Similarly, there was no evidence of a reduction in emotional abuse as a result of receiving advocacy at 24 months follow-up (MD &#8722; 0.04, 95% CI &#8722; 0.19 to 0.11; n = 265; <LINK REF="CMP-003.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.3</LINK>).</P>
<P>A forest plot (<LINK REF="CMP-003.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.5</LINK>) shows the effectiveness of any type of advocacy (brief or intensive) on emotional abuse, as expressed using a continuous measure.</P>
<P>With the exception of the two trials by Tiwari and colleagues, there is little evidence that advocacy reduces or leads to a cessation of emotional abuse. This conclusion holds for studies conducted both within and outside of healthcare settings and for studies offering either short or more intensive sessions of advocacy.</P>

<P>The studies did not show any significant benefit in women receiving brief advocacy sessions. The point estimate in <LINK REF="STD-Hyman-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Hyman 2001</LINK> (<LINK REF="CMP-006.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 6.1</LINK>) favoured the intervention group, but the CIs included zero (MD &#8722; 7.74, 95% CI &#8722; 20.33 to 4.85; n = 53; low quality evidence).</P>
<P>There was no evidence to suggest that women who received advocacy reported less abuse than women in the control arm at up to 12 months (SMD &#8722; 0.23, 95% CI &#8722; 0.53 to 0.08; n = 181; very low quality evidence; <LINK REF="CMP-006.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 6.2</LINK>) when combining continuous data from the two intensive advocacy trials (<LINK REF="STD-Sullivan-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Sullivan 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Taft-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Taft 2011</LINK>).

<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Tiwari-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Tiwari 2010</LINK>, which recruited women from a community centre and provided brief advocacy over a 12-week period, observed no significant benefit at six months follow-up either in terms of improved 'physical' quality of life (MD 0.80, 95% CI &#8722; 1.27 to 2.87; n = 200) or improved 'mental' quality of life (MD 0.37, 95% CI &#8722; 1.94 to 2.68; n = 200; <LINK REF="CMP-007.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 7.1</LINK>).

<LINK REF="STD-Taft-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Taft 2011</LINK> trained 'mentor mothers' to provide up to 12 months intensive advocacy to abused women recruited within primary care clinics (although the intervention was administered in the community). This study had mixed results (<LINK REF="CMP-007.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 7.3</LINK>): women who received advocacy reported significant improvements in their 'physical' quality of life immediately postintervention (MD 4.90, 95% CI 0.98 to 8.82; n = 103), but this did not extend to their perceived 'mental' quality of life (MD 1.90, 95% CI &#8722; 2.92 to 6.72; n = 103). Two of the studies conducted by Sullivan and colleagues (<LINK REF="STD-Sullivan-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Sullivan 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sullivan-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Sullivan 2002</LINK>) evaluated the effectiveness of advocacy delivered over a period of 10 to 16 weeks for women leaving domestic violence shelters or referred from social and family service agencies (<LINK REF="CMP-007.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 7.4</LINK>). Both studies reported data at 12 months, and when pooled, data indicated a higher quality of life for women in the intervention group (MD 0.23, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.46; n = 343). Only one of these two studies followed up participants beyond 12 months (<LINK REF="STD-Sullivan-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Sullivan 1992</LINK>); data were obtained at two years postintervention and again at three years (but only for the original smaller sample of recruited women). There was no evidence that intensive advocacy improved quality of life at two (MD 0.25, 95% CI &#8722; 0.02 to 0.52; n = 265) or three years (MD 0.30, 95% CI &#8722; 0.07 to 0.67; n = 124). It is important to note that these findings differ from the significant effects reported by the study authors. We calculated mean differences based on the reported raw means and standard deviations, while the study authors reported findings based on multivariate analyses (two-year follow-up) and employed a P &lt; 0.10 significance level to avoid type II errors as a result of the smaller sample size (three-year follow-up).</P>

<P>All three trials of brief advocacy followed women for less than 12 months postintervention. We pooled continuous data from two of the studies, one of which recruited women from a community centre (<LINK REF="STD-Tiwari-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Tiwari 2010</LINK>) and one from a primary care clinic (<LINK REF="STD-Gillum-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Gillum 2009</LINK>). As indicated in <LINK REF="CMP-008.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 8.1</LINK>, there was no evidence that women receiving advocacy reported lower levels of depression than women in the control group (SMD &#8722; 0.17, 95% CI &#8722;0.43 to 0.08, I = 0%; n = 239). A meta-analysis of dichotomous data from <LINK REF="STD-Gillum-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Gillum 2009</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Tiwari-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Tiwari 2005</LINK> (both in healthcare settings) showed that significantly fewer women developed depression (NNT = 4) if they received a brief advocacy intervention (OR 0.31, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.65, I = 24%; n = 149; <LINK REF="CMP-008.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 8.2</LINK>).</P>
<P>Of the three intensive advocacy studies, two recruited women exiting from domestic violence shelters (<LINK REF="STD-Sullivan-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Sullivan 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sullivan-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Sullivan 2002</LINK>) and one recruited women from primary care clinics (<LINK REF="STD-Taft-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Taft 2011</LINK>). All three trials assessed depression using a continuous measure at &#8804; 12 months follow-up, and a meta-analysis of these data (<LINK REF="CMP-008.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 8.3</LINK>) revealed no evidence that intensive adequacy reduces depression (SMD &#8722; 0.14, 95% CI &#8722; 0.33 to 0.05, I = 27%; n = 446). In this meta-analysis, it should be highlighted that our calculated mean difference for <LINK REF="STD-Sullivan-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Sullivan 2002</LINK> differs from the statistically significant effect reported by the study investigators, who conducted a multivariate analysis. Only one of these three intensive advocacy studies measured depression over a longer time period (<LINK REF="STD-Sullivan-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Sullivan 1992</LINK>); again, at two years follow-up, there was no evidence that receiving advocacy reduced depression among women in the intervention arm (SMD &#8722; 0.12, 95% CI &#8722; 0.36 to 0.12; n = 265; <LINK REF="CMP-008.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 8.3</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Taft-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Taft 2011</LINK> also assessed the effectiveness of intensive advocacy on depression immediately postintervention using a dichotomous measure (<LINK REF="CMP-008.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 8.4</LINK>).

<P>For descriptive purposes only, two forests plot outline the evidence for the effectiveness of any type of advocacy (brief or intensive) on depression, as measured using a continuous measure (<LINK REF="CMP-008.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 8.5</LINK>) and a dichotomous measure (<LINK REF="CMP-008.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 8.6</LINK>).</P>

<P>For the brief intervention set in an accident and emergency department (<LINK REF="STD-Hyman-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Hyman 2001</LINK>), there was significant evidence that advocacy reduced psychological distress at three to four months follow-up (MD &#8722; 0.56, 95% CI &#8722; 1.09 to &#8722; 0.03; n = 53; <LINK REF="CMP-009.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 9.1</LINK>).</P>

As indicated in <LINK REF="CMP-009.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 9.2</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Sullivan-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Sullivan 1992</LINK> reported no statistically significant reduction of anxiety associated with the receipt of intensive advocacy at any time over the following three years: at 12 months (MD &#8722; 0.13, 95% CI &#8722; 0.35 to 0.09; n = 265), 24 months (MD &#8722; 0.01, 95% CI &#8722; 0.22 to 0.20; n = 265), or 36 months (MD &#8722; 0.11, 95% CI &#8722; 0.40 to 0.18; n = 124). In the one study that reported change-from-baseline data (<LINK REF="STD-Constantino-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Constantino 2005</LINK>), the women were only followed up immediately postintervention. There was no evidence that advocacy decreased psychological distress (change-score MD &#8722; 35.41, 95% CI &#8722; 75.98 to 5.16; n = 24; <LINK REF="CMP-009.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 9.3</LINK>).

It is important to note that for the ORs given below, our calculated percentages differ slightly from those reported in the paper. As indicated in <LINK REF="CMP-012.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 12.1</LINK>, there was no evidence to suggest that women who received the intervention were less likely to deliver underweight babies as compared with women in the control group (babies weighing less than 2500 g, n = 306, OR 0.70, 95% CI 0.36 to 1.37; and babies weighing less than 1500 g, n = 306, OR 0.17, 95% CI 0.02 to 1.41).

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Perceived social support</HEADING>
<P>Five of the studies assessed social support: one of these investigated the effect of brief advocacy for abused women recruited at a community centre (<LINK REF="STD-Tiwari-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Tiwari 2010</LINK>); and four evaluated the effect of intensive advocacy offered over a prolonged period to women recruited in or exiting domestic violence shelters, referred from social and family service agencies (<LINK REF="STD-Constantino-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Constantino 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sullivan-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Sullivan 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sullivan-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Sullivan 2002</LINK>), or attending primary care clinics (<LINK REF="STD-Taft-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Taft 2011</LINK>). All of these studies assessed social support using an overall measure, but one trial also assessed four separate components of social support (<LINK REF="STD-Constantino-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Constantino 2005</LINK>). This study was also different from the others in that the authors assessed mean change from baseline. We obtained additional statistical data from authors of all four intensive advocacy studies.</P>
<P>There was no evidence that abused women receiving brief advocacy in <LINK REF="STD-Tiwari-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Tiwari 2010</LINK> reported higher levels of social support at six months follow-up compared with women in the control arm (MD 1.60, 95% CI &#8722; 0.37 to 3.57; n = 200; <LINK REF="CMP-020.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 20.1</LINK>). It is important to note that this calculated effect size differs from the statistically significant finding (P value = 0.01) reported by the study authors, who adjusted for baseline differences.</P>
<P>Three of the intensive advocacy trials reported data from the 12-month follow-up that could be pooled (<LINK REF="STD-Sullivan-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Sullivan 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sullivan-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Sullivan 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Taft-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Taft 2011</LINK>). As indicated in the forest plot (<LINK REF="CMP-020.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 20.2</LINK>), there was no evidence to suggest that advocacy had a positive effect on social support in the short-term (SMD 0.00, 95% CI &#8722; 0.19 to 0.19, I = 16%; n = 446). Further follow-up data were only available from one of these studies (<LINK REF="STD-Sullivan-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Sullivan 1992</LINK>). There was no evidence that advocacy improved social support at two years (SMD 0.12, 95% CI &#8722; 0.12 to 0.37; n = 265), but by three years (based on the smaller original sample recruited in to the study), there was a clear and significant beneficial effect on social support outcomes (SMD 0.39, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.74; n = 124). <LINK REF="STD-Constantino-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Constantino 2005</LINK> (n = 24) reported finding no effect on overall social support following advocacy (using a non-parametric test), but our analysis (<LINK REF="CMP-020.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 20.3</LINK>) indicates that there was a positive effect (change-score MD 10.19, 95% CI 5.67 to 14.71) when the women were followed up immediately postintervention. Similarly, while the authors reported an improvement only on the 'belonging' subscale, our analysis showed significant effects for all four subscales: 'tangible' (change-score MD 2.19, 95% CI 0.93 to 3.45), 'appraisal' (change-score MD 0.67, 95% CI 0.14 to 1.20), 'self esteem' (change-score MD 1.14, 95% CI 0.43 to 1.85), and 'belonging' (change-score MD 4.18, 95% CI 1.18 to 7.18).</P>
<P>For descriptive purposes only, <LINK REF="CMP-020.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 20.4</LINK> presents a forest plot showing the effectiveness of any type of advocacy (brief or intensive) on social support.</P>
<P>There are insufficient studies to draw a conclusion about the benefits of brief advocacy. For intensive advocacy, there is inconsistent evidence that such an intervention improves social support in the short term. In the long term, intensive advocacy may produce a positive effect, but this is based on the findings of one small study in women who actively sought help.</P>

<P>Both trials measured this outcome at up to 12 months follow-up, and thus we were able to pool the data (<LINK REF="CMP-021.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 21.1</LINK>). We found no statistically significant, positive, short-term effect (OR 1.22, 95% CI 0.74 to 2.00, I = 0%; n = 301). Similar results were evident in <LINK REF="STD-Sullivan-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Sullivan 1992</LINK>, the one study that measured independence from the abuser at 12 to 24 months follow-up (OR 1.27, 95% CI 0.78 to 2.08; n = 261) and at three years (OR 0.97, 95% CI 0.47 to 1.98; n = 119).</P>

A best case scenario (imputing an improved outcome for women in the intervention group and a lack of improvement in the control arm) produced a larger effect size, but the CIs still included no effect (OR 1.58, 95% CI 0.98 to 2.55). Other scenarios also produced non-significant results: assumption that missing women in both intervention and control groups were independent (OR 1.13, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.80), assumption that missing women in the intervention group were still dependent but those in the control arm were independent (OR 0.82, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.31), and assumption that missing women in both intervention and control groups were dependent (OR 1.13, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.82).</P>

As indicated in <LINK REF="CMP-023.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 23.1</LINK>, pooled data from these three studies at &#8804; 12 months follow-up showed that abused women who received advocacy employed a significantly higher number of safety behaviours compared with women receiving usual care (MD 1.39, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.87, I = 97%; n = 558). However, this benefit was not apparent in <LINK REF="STD-McFarlane-2006" TYPE="STUDY">McFarlane 2006</LINK>, the one trial with a two-year follow-up (MD 0.10, 95% CI &#8722; 0.42 to 0.62; n = 319). We were not able to obtain any usable data for the <LINK REF="STD-Cripe-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Cripe 2010</LINK> study. The paper reports that when women were followed up 14 to 28 weeks postintervention, there was an increase in the number of women in the intervention group who adopted 8 of the 13 safety behaviours (range 1.8% to 30.3%); this contrasts with a smaller increase of women in the control group who adopted four of the safety behaviours (range 0.5% to 11.2%).

<HEADING LEVEL="6">Use of resources</HEADING>
<P>The use of resources was measured by four brief advocacy studies recruiting abused women in healthcare settings: <LINK REF="STD-McFarlane-2000" TYPE="STUDY">McFarlane 2000</LINK> employed a summary dichotomous measure of 10 resources, <LINK REF="STD-McFarlane-2006" TYPE="STUDY">McFarlane 2006</LINK> used a summary continuous measure of a revised 8-item version, <LINK REF="STD-Gillum-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Gillum 2009</LINK> used a 15-item measure, and <LINK REF="STD-Cripe-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Cripe 2010</LINK> reported individual frequency data for 7 items. At protocol stage (<LINK REF="REF-Ramsay-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ramsay 2005</LINK>), we had planned to collect data on participants&#8217; use of refuges/shelters, use of counselling, calls to police, police reports filed and protection orders sought, as individual items. However these data were not available in the reported papers, which used composite checklists. This means the findings reported below are based on related but not identical measures. The resources common to all four studies were domestic violence services/battered women's groups, alcohol/drug treatments, healthcare, and legal services. Both of the studies by McFarlane and colleagues provided multiple, brief sessions of advocacy over a period of months and conducted short-term (up to 12 months) and medium-term (12 to 24 months) follow-up. The trial by <LINK REF="STD-Gillum-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Gillum 2009</LINK> (additional unpublished data provided) also administered multiple sessions of advocacy (face-to-face and via telephone) over a three-month period, but follow-up was restricted to immediately postintervention. <LINK REF="CMP-024.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 24.1</LINK> presents the effect sizes for the trials using a continuous measure (<LINK REF="STD-Gillum-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Gillum 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McFarlane-2006" TYPE="STUDY">McFarlane 2006</LINK>). There was no evidence that advocacy increased resource use: SMD 0.19, 95% CI &#8722; 0.02 to 0.39, I = 0%; n = 358 at 12 months follow-up; and MD 0.15, 95% CI &#8722; 0.07 to 0.37; n = 319 at 24 months following the first intervention session (with sessions being provided thereafter every six months). The study employing a dichotomous measure (<LINK REF="STD-McFarlane-2000" TYPE="STUDY">McFarlane 2000</LINK>) reported no evidence to suggest that advocacy increased the likelihood of resource use over and above that found in the control group of women at any time point, either when advocacy was offered on its own or in combination with the services of a 'mentor mother'. In fact, the opposite occurred, and the likelihood of accessing resources dropped below baseline levels in all groups; particularly in the control (from 32% to 17%) and advocacy (from 33% to 17%) groups, but also for the group with access to a 'mentor mother' (from 23% to 21%). We were unable to calculate the effect sizes for this trial because of the baseline differences between the three groups. <LINK REF="STD-Cripe-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Cripe 2010</LINK> provided frequency data on the use of individual resources following a 30-minute advocacy session. The authors report that there were no statistically significant differences in the type of community resource accessed by the women in the two trial arms 14 to 28 weeks postintervention, but they did not provide test values. The results from these four trials suggest that brief advocacy has minimal effect on subsequent resource use by abused women recruited in healthcare settings.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Sullivan-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Sullivan 1991</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Sullivan-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Sullivan 1992</LINK> assessed this outcome, the latter providing additional data on top of what they reported in their papers. Both studies recruited women exiting a domestic violence shelter and provided intensive weekly advocacy sessions over a 10-week period. However, <LINK REF="STD-Sullivan-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Sullivan 1991</LINK> did not report any means or standard deviations, nor did the authors make them available. Findings from <LINK REF="STD-Sullivan-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Sullivan 1992</LINK> were mixed. There was no evidence to suggest that abused women who received advocacy experienced fewer difficulties in accessing resources when compared with women in the control arm, either at 12 months follow-up (MD &#8722; 0.01, 95% CI &#8722; 0.16 to 0.14; n = 265) or at three years (MD &#8722; 0.12, 95% CI &#8722; 0.33 to 0.09; n = 124). However, at the two-year follow-up, there was a benefit associated with receiving advocacy (MD &#8722; 0.18, 95% CI &#8722; 0.34 to &#8722; 0.02; n = 265; <LINK REF="CMP-025.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 25.1</LINK>). Based on the findings of this one trial, at present there is insufficient evidence to indicate whether intensive advocacy does or does not decrease difficulties in accessing resources.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-11-20 14:12:00 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review identified 11 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and 2 quasi-RCTs (reported in 21 papers) that examined the effectiveness of advocacy interventions conducted within healthcare settings (8 studies) and in the community (5 studies), for women who had experienced intimate partner abuse. The studies recruited 2141 participants. The concept of empowerment was integral to the interventions, as was the belief that the help provided should be tailored to meet the wants and needs of the individual women. However, the primary studies had considerable heterogeneity in terms of the intensity of the advocacy offered (from about 30 minutes up to 80 hours), the between-study differences in staff delivering the advocacy (paraprofessional students, nurses, professional advocates, psychologists, social workers, community health workers, trained 'mentor mothers', and study investigators), the wide range of outcomes reported (25 different outcomes), the methods used to assess these outcomes (continuous or dichotomous measures), and their observed effects. Three of the trials differed in that they evaluated multi-component interventions in which advocacy was one of several components. The duration of follow-up also varied across studies and ranged from immediately postintervention to three years. This heterogeneity meant we could only perform a limited number of meta-analyses. The remainder of the syntheses are in narrative form.</P>
<P>We have summarised results in two logic models, one for brief advocacy (<LINK REF="FIG-04" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 4</LINK>) and one for intensive advocacy (<LINK REF="FIG-05" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 5</LINK>).</P>
<P>Overall, we found equivocal evidence that advocacy reduces or leads to a cessation of abuse. There was evidence from two studies with moderate risk of bias that brief advocacy administered in antenatal care may reduce physical abuse at up to 12 months follow-up, but in one of these the benefit was limited to minor physical abuse. The other study had only immediate postintervention follow-up, and nearly two-thirds of the abused women (62%) would also have received CBT for depression in addition to advocacy. There is moderate to low quality evidence for a lack of effect of brief advocacy in reducing physical abuse (severity undifferentiated) in other settings and designs at up to 12 months follow-up. There is low to very low quality evidence that there is a marginal reduction in physical abuse from intensive advocacy at up to 12 months follow-up. However, the two trials of intensive advocacy in women recruited in domestic violence shelters/refuges had a high risk of bias. One of these studies had medium term follow-up and reported that intensive advocacy increased the cessation of physical abuse in women exiting a shelter at 12 to 24 months.</P>
<P>There is moderate quality evidence that brief advocacy has no effect in reducing sexual abuse at up to 12 months follow-up.</P>
<P>The evidence for brief or intensive advocacy reducing emotional abuse is inconsistent. There is moderate-to-low quality evidence that brief advocacy reduces emotional abuse at up to 12 months follow-up in an antenatal setting but not in other settings. Aside from the one study with positive findings, four other trials of brief advocacy showed no positive effect on emotional abuse (three recruiting within healthcare and one in the community). The one study of intensive advocacy also failed to demonstrate any benefit.</P>
<P>There is low to very low quality evidence indicating that both brief and intensive advocacy slightly reduce overall abuse; the confidence intervals either include zero or cross the line of no effect.</P>
<P>In summary, there were no differences between the intervention and control arms of the primary studies for the majority of abuse outcomes, none of the evidence was of good quality, and data from most of the studies for most of the abuse outcomes could not be pooled to increase the power of the analyses.</P>
<P>Studies measuring other primary psychosocial outcomes showed some benefit for advocacy but, as with abuse measures, evidence was not good quality, and benefits were not consistent across studies and settings. There was evidence that brief advocacy improves depression in abused women attending healthcare facilities and that psychological distress may decrease when abused women attending a hospital emergency department receive a brief session of advocacy. However, these findings were based on only three studies, and there was no evidence that the effect persisted over time. Neither of the two intensive studies reported an effect on psychological distress. There was no reduction in depression associated with intensive advocacy, and no benefit in terms of reducing anxiety/psychological distress, though the quality of the data was weak. The three trials of brief advocacy that measured the effect on quality of life suggested that there was no benefit. In contrast, there was some low quality evidence that intensive advocacy may improve abused women's quality of life in the short term: two studies assessed overall quality of life in women recruited from domestic violence shelters/refuges and reported an improved 'physical' quality of life (but no equivalent in perceived 'mental' quality of life) when women were recruited in primary care settings.</P>
<P>In terms of secondary outcomes, once again the findings are mixed. There is evidence that brief advocacy leads to more safety behaviours being practiced in the short-term, but in the long-term (and based on results from a single study) this benefit is no longer apparent. Brief advocacy improved perceived anxiety/psychological distress in one trial set in a hospital emergency department. Similarly, abused women receiving brief advocacy within an antenatal setting delivered babies with higher gestational ages; however, no other benefits in birth outcomes were reported. The findings for social support were equivocal; in particular there was contradictory evidence about whether abused women report improved support following intensive advocacy. It remains unclear if advocacy can help women to remain independent of their abusers or to emotionally detach from their abuser. Similarly, there was no evidence to suggest that advocacy improves chronic pain and fatigue, self efficacy, self esteem, or post-traumatic stress disorder, or that women receiving advocacy are more likely to access community resources.</P>
<P>Taken as a whole, we conclude that brief or intensive advocacy administered to abused women may improve a wide range of outcomes, but the magnitude and consistency of these benefits are still uncertain. The positive findings of one antenatal study with low risk of bias were striking in that the provision of a one-off session of advocacy led to a reduction in minor physical abuse, emotional abuse, and post-natal depression (<LINK REF="STD-Tiwari-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Tiwari 2005</LINK>). However, the overall findings from the remaining 12 trials were mixed, reflecting the lack of power of the primary studies. Unfortunately, the heterogeneity of interventions and outcomes measured across the studies precluded the pooling of many results and an estimate of the magnitude of the overall effect. Where meta-analysis was possible, we were only able to pool a maximum of three studies. For these reasons, the present findings are not conclusive with regards to the benefits of advocacy.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2015-09-07 14:40:05 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The studies included in this review were conducted on women recruited in a variety of settings, with eight studies based in healthcare organisations. However, most took place in developed, industrialised countries, and none of the trials were carried out in rural settings. Most of the women were recruited because they were experiencing current physical or sexual abuse (within the last 12 months), although seven studies also included women experiencing physical, sexual or emotional abuse. The majority of the participants were married or still in contact with the perpetrator at study entry. The age range of participants was wide (15 to 65 years). Most of the women were of lower socioeconomic status. There was ethnic diversity across many of the trials (whites, African Americans and Latinas), but five studies were ethnically exclusive (African American, Latina and Chinese) or near exclusive (Mestizo).</P>
<P>From the available evidence, we cannot say whether the interventions had similar effects on women experiencing different types of abuse. Many of the women recruited into the studies reported severe physical abuse, so it is possible that advocacy is acceptable to women who are at high risk of further physical and sexual abuse. However, there is also some evidence that advocacy may be more effective with less severe physical abuse. It is not known if advocacy is acceptable to women experiencing other forms of intimate partner abuse, although one of our included studies (<LINK REF="STD-Tiwari-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Tiwari 2010</LINK>) recruited women from a community centre who were primarily experiencing psychological abuse. In terms of differential effects related to where a woman is in the abuse trajectory, we do not know whether women actively seeking help (such as those recruited in shelters or refuges) might benefit more or less from advocacy than women who have just disclosed abuse, such as those recruited in a healthcare setting. We cannot resolve that question based on the included studies, as there was no consistent difference in benefits for different outcomes between settings. There was also little evidence available to show if advocacy interventions were any more or less effective amongst people from different ethnic groups. The urban setting common to all of the studies prevents us from drawing any conclusions about the effectiveness of advocacy interventions for abused women residing in rural locations.</P>
<P>It was not possible to determine what aspects of advocacy interventions were the most or the least effective, as none of the included studies considered this question, and there were not enough studies to pool for any outcome for meta-regression analysis. Neither were we able to reach any conclusions about the potential additional impact on outcomes from the studies that were multi-component in content (i.e. which offered components other than advocacy to abused women, their children, or both), as there were insufficient studies to conduct a subgroup analysis.</P>
<P>One study did not lose any participants over time (<LINK REF="STD-Tiwari-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Tiwari 2010</LINK>), while another lost nearly half (48%) of its sample (<LINK REF="STD-Hyman-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Hyman 2001</LINK>).

<P>Only one trial was assessed to have low risk of bias in all the criteria considered (<LINK REF="STD-Tiwari-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Tiwari 2005</LINK>). Four of the studies provided insufficient detail to confidently ascertain whether they complied with at least four of the eight 'Risk of bias' criteria. In six trials, there were insufficient details about the method of sequence generation, and in five of the studies it was not clear if allocation concealment was maintained (in a further three studies, this was compromised). Four studies did not give sufficient information on whether the outcomes measures were assessed blindly (and a further four were not blinded). Seven did not provide full details on the completeness of their data or else had attrition that was significantly different between groups. Eight of the studies did not discuss what steps, if any, were taken to prevent women in the control group from receiving components of the intervention (and a further three reported that this was compromised). We were unable to attribute differences in effect sizes for any given outcome to the risk of bias. Taken as a whole, we conclude that the present evidence for the effectiveness of advocacy is undermined because of difficulties in assessing the risk of bias for most trials in the review. Future reports of advocacy interventions should include full details on how the studies have been conducted, thereby allowing for the risk of bias to be determined.</P>
<P>When considering the data in terms of GRADE for abuse outcomes at &#8804; 12 months follow-up, the quality of evidence for most abuse outcomes from intensive advocacy was rated as very low, in all cases because of a combination of risk of bias and imprecision. All studies lost GRADE points because of imprecision, which was judged to occur with continuous measures when the sample size was less than 400, the standard deviation was greater than 0.5, or both, and with dichotomous measures when the results crossed the line of no effect, the total number of outcome events was less than 300, or both. This highlights the need for larger studies; four of the studies in this review were pilots, which may partly also explain the high risk of bias.</P>
<P>Using GRADE, we found that the quality of the evidence for abuse outcomes for brief advocacy was higher, though still poor; the evidence was assessed as moderate to low, with none being considered very low quality. Reasons were mixed, with five rated as moderate because of imprecision issues, one because of indirectness, and one because of risk of bias; three outcome results were graded as low quality.</P>

<P>We believe that our review process identified all RCTs and quasi-RCTs on advocacy interventions for women experiencing partner abuse published up to the censor date. We also obtained a copy of an unpublished PhD thesis that evaluated an advocacy intervention. We obtained additional data from all but one of the study authors that we contacted. Likewise, the majority of trialists responded to our request to inform us of any other trials that we may have missed. Other experts in this field also responded to our request asking if they knew of any additional trials. Two review authors independently made decisions about inclusion of studies and assessment of risk of bias and outcome quality, and another checked data extraction.</P>

<P>This review broadly concurs with the findings of previous reviews of advocacy interventions (<LINK REF="REF-Abel-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Abel 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Feder-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Feder 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hender-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hender 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Klevens-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Klevens 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nelson-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nelson 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ramsay-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ramsay 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ramsay-2005a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ramsay 2005a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wathen-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wathen 2003</LINK>) and the review on which the WHO guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2013b" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2013b</LINK>) are based, although by restricting ourselves to RCTs and quasi-RCTs, we have excluded studies that were included in some of the other reviews. Hence, we were more conservative in our judgement of the effectiveness of advocacy. However, by increasing the number of identified RCTs and quasi-RCTs and calculating effect sizes for most of the outcomes reported in the included studies, we have extended the findings of earlier reviews. Previous reviews have reported the findings as reported by the individual study authors. By calculating the effect sizes (mean or SMD and OR) we were able to compare across studies. We have also highlighted some discrepancies between results reported as statistically significant and the effect sizes as calculated by our team. Generally we concur that, while there is some evidence that advocacy in health or community settings can reduce further abuse and improve psychosocial outcomes of women experiencing partner abuse, there are too few studies studying the same intervention and measuring the same outcomes over a reasonable period of time to draw any firm conclusions about the magnitude of the benefit or the populations most amenable to the interventions.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2015-09-07 14:47:01 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Our results suggest that the existing body of research evidence has not fully established the potential benefits of advocacy (either offered as a brief or more intensive intervention), including cessation or reduction of abuse, improved quality of life, and reductions in depression and anxiety.</P>
<P>We do not believe that the weak evidence for advocacy as an intervention for intimate partner abuse means that existing services should be withdrawn. The evidence has actually strengthened with the results of recent trials, and we await the findings of new studies of advocacy within and outside of healthcare settings. The weakness of the current evidence base means that we cannot adequately judge their effectiveness, not that advocacy interventions are necessarily ineffective. The largely positive point estimates for most of the outcomes in all of the studies may not be a firm basis for systematically extending advocacy to healthcare settings, but they should encourage further evaluation of advocacy's role in these settings, including routine monitoring of outcomes for women receiving advocacy.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2015-11-09 15:41:03 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Further research is required to determine the effect of advocacy interventions for abused women in a number of areas. In this respect&#8212;and in keeping with our earlier review&#8212;we make the following recommendations.</P>
<P>First, there is a need for more trials of advocacy interventions in a variety of settings, particularly in healthcare settings. We know that women experiencing partner violence present frequently to health services and require wide-ranging medical services (<LINK REF="REF-Campbell-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Campbell 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Davidson-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davidson 2001</LINK>), and that abused women themselves identify primary care clinicians as appropriate people from whom to seek help and assistance (<LINK REF="REF-Feder-2006b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Feder 2006b</LINK>). However, while the number of such studies has increased, we still found only one study conducted in an accident and emergency care setting, two based in primary care/public health clinics and mother and child clinics, and four in antenatal clinics.</P>
<P>Second, we need debate over which outcomes should be measured in advocacy trials. The studies included in this review examined a wide range of outcomes. However, it is questionable whether all of these might be expected to change as a result of receiving advocacy. For example, the outcome 'independence from abuser' is not necessarily a desirable outcome from the survivor&#8217;s point of view, although it is legitimate in that there is a subgroup of women who report that they want to leave the relationship (McFarlane 2013 [pers comm] in <LINK REF="STD-McFarlane-2000" TYPE="STUDY">McFarlane 2000</LINK>). Trials need to examine a smaller range of outcomes, and these should be measured using more standardised scales. This will require consensus among researchers in this field.</P>
<P>Third, more evidence is needed from trials where the participants are followed up for years, rather than weeks or months. Data on long-term outcomes are essential since some effects are likely to attenuate over time and others may not emerge until years after an intervention has ended.</P>
<P>Fourth, trials need to test theoretically explicit interventions to determine what works (or does not work) for whom, when, and in what contexts. In particular, interventions should take into account the stages that abused women go through in dealing with their situation (<LINK REF="REF-Hegarty-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hegarty 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zink-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zink 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>Fifth, further work is needed to ascertain how advocacy interventions can be tailored to cultural variations between ethnic groups (<LINK REF="REF-Rodriguez-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rodriguez 2006</LINK>) and for abused women living in rural communities, resource poor settings, or both. In the development of the WHO guidelines on the healthcare response to intimate partner violence and sexual abuse (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2013c" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2013c</LINK>), applying the evidence on advocacy outside of resource-rich countries was problematic.</P>
<P>Finally, economic analyses are required to ascertain if the resources devoted to advocacy interventions are cost-effective in healthcare and community settings.<BR/>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">2009 review</HEADING>
<P>In our protocol we stated that we would search the criminal justice electronic databases but ultimately this was not possible. The process of searching these databases proved unhelpful due to the use of terms with vastly different meanings in the justice disciplines (such as trial or control).</P>
<P>A further difference relates to some of the outcome measures that we analysed. In the review, we included four outcomes that were not mentioned in the protocol but which we subsequently decided were of interest: risk of homicide, work harassment, independence from abuser, and emotional attachment to the abuser. Additionally, we had not anticipated that the use of resources by participants would be measured using a composite scale, rather than individual measures of the various resources available.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">2015 update to review</HEADING>
<P>In our protocol, we stated that we would include studies where advocacy was evaluated as an adjunct to another intervention, but on the proviso that advocacy was the only difference between the two trial arms. In the updated review, however, we have also included trials where women in the intervention arm may have received advocacy plus some other form of intervention compared with no care or usual care. The review team judged that this change was necessary given the increasing number of trials evaluating advocacy within the context of multi-component interventions. Similar considerations would be given to studies with multiple eligible arms or multiple control conditions in a single trial, so long as the inclusion criteria are met and results for advocacy are available separately.</P>
<P>A further change from the original 2009 review relates to our definition of 'usual care'. Originally we specified that we would include all studies where advocacy was compared with no care or usual care. However, increasingly usual care can sometimes incorporate elements of advocacy. For the purposes of evaluating the effectiveness of advocacy interventions more rigorously, in the updated review we excluded any studies where usual care included a substantial element of advocacy and was received by more than 20% of women in the control arm. Again, the review team judged that this change was necessary given the increasing use of advocacy as a usual care treatment.</P>
<P>Moreover, this update includes trials in which the unit of analysis is not the woman. We have updated our methods section accordingly.</P>
<P>A further difference relates to some of the outcome measures that we analysed. We had not anticipated that the use of resources by participants would be measured using a composite scale, rather than individual measures of the various resources available, and we have included this aspect in both the 2009 and 2015 updates. In the 2009 review we included four outcomes that were not mentioned in the protocol but which we subsequently decided were of interest: risk of homicide, work harassment, independence from abuser, emotional attachment to the abuser. In the 2015 update we also added perceived stress to this list. Additionally, for the current 2015 update, we had not predicted that abuse might be assessed using a composite scale (overall abuse) rather than discrete measures of the different forms of intimate partner abuse, and so we included this outcome also.</P>
<P>In our protocol, assessment of risk of bias of included studies did not include the item &#8216;contamination&#8217;, which is now included.</P>
<P>We originally stated that a fixed-effect model would only be used if there was no significant statistical heterogeneity. However the following analyses, performed with a fixed-effect model, have moderate/high statistical heterogeneity: <LINK REF="CMP-003.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.1</LINK> (I = 51%), <LINK REF="CMP-004.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.1</LINK> (I = 58%), <LINK REF="CMP-007.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 7.2</LINK> (I = 72%), <LINK REF="CMP-007.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 7.2</LINK>.2 (I = 56%), Analysis <LINK REF="CMP-007.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 7.2</LINK>.3 (I = 72%), <LINK REF="CMP-007.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 7.2</LINK>.7 (I = 81%), and <LINK REF="CMP-023.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 23.1</LINK> (I = 97%). This heterogeneity is due to the confidence intervals crossing 0 or 1 (depending on the analysis), so using a random-effects model would not change the conclusions.</P>

</P>
<OL>
<LI>Women who participated in the study at treatment clinics received the following intervention: integrated IPV and health screening; supportive care; safety planning and harm reduction counselling; supportive referrals; and booster counselling sessions at 3 months after baseline. The majority of materials utilised for the intervention were adapted from existing IPPF/WHR materials used in other Latin American and Caribbean contexts and were adapted to the characteristics of Mexico City. A referral directory was also created with the contact information of local community agencies that provide services to IPV victims. Pilot work revealed that women felt more comfortable asking for services if there was a specific person to contact at an agency, and that only having the name of an agency was a deterrent</LI>
<LI>For endline data collection, research assistants will conduct 45 qualitative interviews with female participants to provide insight into observed quantitative results</LI>
<LI>A total of 197 nurses (approximately 8% male nurses and 45% in treatment clinics) from all 42 health clinics received the training. 147 nurses are actively participating in the study (49% in treatment clinics; 26% of staff dropped out primarily due to staff turnover at clinics). Nurses in the intervention group received a 3-day training course that covered all the topics of the intervention, and then nurses received up to 3 visits by research staff to practice delivering the intervention through role playing exercises individually and in the clinics. Specific topics in the training included an introduction to IPV, health consequences of IPV, legal considerations in Mexico City, methods to screen for violence and assess for health implications such as reproductive coercion, safety and ethical considerations, referral methods and linkages to other organisations in the community. An educational video modelling the counselling sessions was also developed by the study team for the training of treatment nurses. This video was shown and discussed during research assistant visits to the health clinics as part of the training</LI>

<LI>Women in the control clinics were given a referral card containing general information on IPV and a list of resources, which was consistent with the current goal for standard of care in the Mexico City Ministry of Health. The referral card is the size of a business card so that it may easily be hidden from male partners and is widely used in other IPV screening programmes</LI>
<LI>Staff in control clinics received a 1-day training session that focused mainly on sensitising nurses and training them on using the abuse assessment. Control clinic staff will receive the intervention training upon completion of the study</LI>
<LI>15 interviews have been conducted with nurses at treatment clinics to understand their experiences with the healthcare professional delivered approach between the 3-month follow-up period and the final endline at 15 months</LI>

<P>Theoretical justification for subgroup analyses.</P>
<OL>
<LI>Domestic violence activists and service providers argue that the effectiveness of advocacy is enhanced by integration of advocacy services into a co-ordinated community response, including criminal justice agencies, refuges/shelters, welfare support, and health services (<LINK REF="REF-Feder-2006a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Feder 2006a</LINK>). This strategy, based on the Duluth model, is a network of agreements, processes and applied principles created by the local shelter movement, criminal justice agencies, healthcare, and human service programmes (<LINK REF="REF-Clapp-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clapp 2000</LINK>). The proposed subgroup analysis will test whether the (potential) effectiveness of advocacy is enhanced (or diminished) by other interventions in the context of a co-ordinated community response. It is theoretically plausible that even in the absence of a fully co-ordinated community response, an additional intervention combined with advocacy will have a synergistic effect; therefore we will include studies that test a combined intervention, as long as the control group is also exposed to the additional intervention.</LI>
<LI>If domestic violence advocacy is an effective intervention overall, policy makers and service commissioners need to know if this effect is moderated by the setting in which it is delivered. For example, if a healthcare setting enhanced the effect, then this would be an appropriate context for commissioning advocacy.</LI>
