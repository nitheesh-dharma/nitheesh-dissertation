<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2012-01-06 22:48:37 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="Julie A Brown">
<P>Ovarian surgery in women with clomiphene-resistant polycystic ovarian syndrome reduces the risk of multiple pregnancy without decreasing the pregnancy rate. Women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) have trouble ovulating. Some treatment schedules with medical ovulation induction can overstimulate the ovary and cause multiple pregnancy. An alternative is a minor surgical procedure called laparoscopic ovarian drilling, where a long telescope is passed through a small cut in the umbilicus. The ovaries are then surgically treated by drilling, using either heat or laser. This review of trials found that ovarian drilling without or with ovulation induction, if necessary, was as effective as medical ovulation induction alone in inducing ovulation, but the risk of multiple pregnancies was lower in the group of women who had laparoscopic ovarian drilling. Approximately 37% of women will have a live birth and 7% will have a miscarriage with either procedure.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2012-01-06 22:17:07 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="Julie A Brown">
<P>Surgical ovarian wedge resection was the first established treatment for women with anovulatory polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) but was largely abandoned both due to the risk of postsurgical adhesions and the introduction of medical ovulation induction. However, women with PCOS who are treated with medical ovulation induction, with drugs such as gonadotrophins, often have an over-production of follicles which may result in ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome and multiple pregnancies. Moreover, gonadotrophins, though effective, are costly and time-consuming and their use requires intensive monitoring. Surgical therapy with laparoscopic ovarian 'drilling' (LOD) may avoid or reduce the need for medical ovulation induction, or may facilitate its usefulness. The procedure can be done on an outpatient basis with less trauma and fewer postoperative adhesions than with traditional surgical approaches. Many uncontrolled observational studies have claimed that ovarian drilling is followed, at least temporarily, by a high rate of spontaneous ovulation and conception, or that subsequent medical ovulation induction becomes easier.</P>

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2012-05-16 13:30:15 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="Julie A Brown">
<P>We used the search strategy of the Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group (MDSG) to search the MDSG Trials Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL and PsycINFO. The keywords included polycystic ovary syndrome, laparoscopic ovarian drilling, electrocautery and diathermy. Searches were conducted in September 2011, and a further search of the MDSG Trials Register was made on 14 May 2012.</P>

<P>This is an update of a previously updated review. There were nine RCTs in the previous version; an additional 16 trials were added in the current (2012) update. All trials were assessed for quality. The primary outcomes were live birth and multiple pregnancy. The secondary outcomes were rate of miscarriage, ovulation and pregnancy rates, ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS), quality of life and cost.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-08-07 11:57:56 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Eight trials, including 1034 women, reported on the primary outcome of live birth rate per couple. Live births were reported in 34% of women in the LOD groups and 40% in other medical treatment groups. There were five different comparisons with LOD and there was no evidence of a difference in live births when compared with clomiphene citrate + tamoxifen (OR 0.81; 95% CI 0.42 to 1.53; P = 0.51, 1 trial, n = 150), gonadotrophins (OR 0.97; 95% CI 0.59 to 1.59; P = 0.89, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%, 2 trials, n = 318) or aromatase inhibitors (OR 0.84; 95% CI 0.54 to 1.31; P = 0.44, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%, 2 trials, n = 407).There was evidence of significantly fewer live births following LOD compared with clomiphene citrate + metformin (OR 0.44; 95% CI 0.24 to 0.82; P = 0.01, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 78%, 2 trials, n = 159); the high heterogeneity in this subgroup could not be explained by population differences or differences in quality of the trials.</P>
<P>Twelve trials reported on multiple pregnancies (n= 1129 women). There were no multiple pregnancies in either group for clomiphene citrate or aromatase inhibitors compared with LOD. The rate of multiple pregnancies was significantly lower in the LOD group compared with trials using gonadotrophins (OR 0.13; 95% CI 0.03 to 0.52; P=0.004, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%, 5 trials, n = 166).</P>

<P>There was no evidence of a significant difference in rates of clinical pregnancy, live birth or miscarriage in women with clomiphene-resistant PCOS undergoing LOD compared to other medical treatments. The reduction in multiple pregnancy rates in women undergoing LOD makes this option attractive. However, there are ongoing concerns about the long-term effects of LOD on ovarian function.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2012-04-24 15:36:58 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="Julie A Brown">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2012-01-06 23:25:45 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="Julie A Brown">
<P>Problems in inducing ovulation and anovulation (failure to ovulate) are well recognised in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Surgical ovarian wedge resection was the first established treatment for women with anovulatory PCOS (<LINK REF="REF-Stein-1939" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stein 1939</LINK>) but was largely abandoned because of the risk of postsurgical adhesion formation, which converted endocrinological (or hormonal) subfertility to mechanical subfertility as a result of scarring (<LINK REF="REF-Adashi-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Adashi 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Buttram-1975" TYPE="REFERENCE">Buttram 1975</LINK>). Wedge resection was replaced by medical ovulation induction with clomiphene and gonadotrophins (<LINK REF="REF-Franks-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Franks 1985</LINK>). Ovulation induction with clomiphene citrate is not always successful, with approximately 20% of women described as 'clomiphene-resistant' (<LINK REF="REF-Imani-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Imani 1998</LINK>). Women who are clomiphene resistant can be treated with gonadotrophins or other medical ovulation induction agents but often have an overproduction of follicles and are exposed to the risks of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) and multiple pregnancy. Drugs such as gonadotrophins are an expensive, inconvenient and time-consuming form of treatment that requires intensive monitoring. An alternative to medical ovulation induction is surgical therapy using laparoscopic techniques known as laparoscopic ovarian drilling (LOD).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2012-01-06 22:56:47 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="Julie A Brown">
<P>Laparoscopic ovarian drilling was first described by Gjonnaess in 1984 (<LINK REF="REF-Gjonnaess-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gjonnaess 1984</LINK>). Both laparoscopic ovarian cautery and laser vaporisation using carbon dioxide (CO2), argon or neodymium-doped yttrium aluminium garnet (Nd:YAG; Nd:Y3Al5O12) crystal lasers have been used to create multiple perforations (approximately 10 holes per ovary) in the ovarian surface and stroma (inner area of the ovary). The procedure can be done on an outpatient basis with less trauma and fewer postoperative adhesions than with ovarian wedge resection. Many uncontrolled observational studies claim that it is followed, at least temporarily, by a high rate of spontaneous postoperative ovulation and conception (<LINK REF="REF-Armar-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Armar 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Armar-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Armar 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Greenblatt-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Greenblatt 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kovacs-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kovacs 1991</LINK>) or that subsequent medical ovulation induction becomes easier (<LINK REF="REF-Farhi-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Farhi 1995</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2012-01-06 22:58:52 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="Julie A Brown">
<P>The mechanism of action of LOD is thought to be similar to that of ovarian wedge resection. Both procedures may destroy ovarian androgen-producing tissue and reduce the peripheral conversion of androgens to estrogens (one of the many disturbances of endocrine physiology that occur in women with polycystic ovarian syndrome). A fall in the serum levels of androgens and luteinising hormone (LH) and an increase in follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels have been demonstrated after ovarian drilling (<LINK REF="REF-Armar-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Armar 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Greenblatt-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Greenblatt 1987</LINK>). The endocrine changes following the surgery are thought to convert the adverse androgen-dominant intrafollicular environment to an estrogenic one (<LINK REF="REF-Aakvaag-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aakvaag 1985</LINK>) and to restore the hormonal environment to normal by correcting disturbances of the ovarian-pituitary feedback mechanism (<LINK REF="REF-Balen-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Balen 1993</LINK>). Thus, both local and systemic effects are thought to promote follicular recruitment, maturation and subsequent ovulation.</P>

The proportion of live births following laparoscopic drilling ranged from 24% to 44% and following other medical treatments ranged from 27% to 62%. The overall summary effect was OR 0.77 (95% CI 0.59 to 1.01, P= 0.18, 8 trials, 1034 women, I<SUP>2</SUP>=31%) There were four different comparisons with LOD and there was no evidence of a significant difference in live births when compared with clomiphene citrate + tamoxifen (OR 0.81; 95% CI 0.42 to 1.53; P = 0.51, 1 trial, n = 150), gonadotrophins (OR 0.97; 95% CI 0.59 to 1.59; P = 0.89, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%, 2 trials, n = 318) or aromatase inhibitors (OR 0.84; 95% CI 0.54 to 1.31; P = 0.44, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%, 2 trials, n = 407). There was evidence of significantly fewer live births following LOD compared with clomiphene citrate + metformin (OR 0.44; 95% CI 0.24 to 0.82; P = 0.01, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 78%, 2 trials, n = 159); the high heterogeneity in this subgroup could not be explained by population differences or differences in the quality of the trials.

<P>One of the trials continued longitudinal follow-up for a mean of 133.5 months (<LINK REF="STD-Bayram-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Bayram 2004</LINK>) for 95% of the original sample. At this extended follow-up point 86% of couples having electrocautery and 81% of couples having recombinant FSH (rFSH) had conceived and reported a live birth (P = 0.63). However, electrocautery resulted in significantly reduced requirements for stimulated cycles to reach a live birth outcome (44/71 live births in the electrocautery group versus 65/69 live births in the rFSH group; RR 0.69; 95% CI 0.55 to 0.88). Significantly more women in the electrocautery group had a second live birth compared with the rFSH group (61% versus 46%; RR 1.3; 95% CI 1.01 to 1.8; P = 0.03). Of those women achieving a second live birth in the electrocautery group 24% required additional treatment as did 19% of those in the rFSH group who had a second live birth. At the end of follow-up there had been 134 live births in the electrocautery group and 124 in the rFSH group (P = 0.09). Of the 175 pregnancies in the electrocautery group, 5 were ectopic pregnancies and 31 miscarriages occurred, compared with 3 ectopic pregnancies of a total of 159 pregnancies in the rFSH group (relative risk (RR) 1.5; 95% CI 0.37 to 6.2) and 23 miscarriages (RR 1.2; 95% CI 0.75 to 2.0).</P>

<P>Ovulation rate was reported in six trials including 525 women (<LINK REF="STD-Amer-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Amer 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Farquhar-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Farquhar 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hamed-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Hamed 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Roy-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Roy 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zakherah-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Zakherah 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zakherah-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Zakherah 2010</LINK>). There was no evidence of a significant difference in ovulation rate for any of the subgroups observed (clomiphene citrate + metformin, clomiphene citrate + tamoxifen, gonadotrophins, clomiphene citrate, metformin, or rosiglitazone + clomiphene citrate). Refer to <LINK REF="CMP-001.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.6</LINK>. Only first cycle data were included in the meta-analyses from the trials reported by <LINK REF="STD-Palomba-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Palomba 2010</LINK>. <LINK REF="STD-Abu-Hashim-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Abu Hashim 2010,</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Abu-Hashim-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Abu Hashim 2011,</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Abdellah-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Abdellah 2011</LINK> reported ovulation rates as per cycle data and not per woman randomised.

<HEADING LEVEL="6">1.7 Costs</HEADING>
<P>Both direct and indirect cost data were collected in five papers from four studies (<LINK REF="STD-Bayram-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Bayram 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Farquhar-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Farquhar 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kaya-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Kaya 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Palomba-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Palomba 2004</LINK> ). Heterogeneity was I<SUP>2</SUP> = 99%, which is probably due to the differing currencies used and the different factors taken into account when calculating costs. Only subgroups have been reported. In the <LINK REF="STD-Bayram-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Bayram 2004</LINK> study the addition of laparoscopic ovarian drilling to the diagnostic laparoscopy added 20 minutes to the procedure. The total cost of treatment for the group having ovarian drilling with medical induction therapy, if necessary, was EUR 4664  1967 and for the gonadotrophin-only group the cost was EUR 5418  3785. The difference was EUR 754 (95% CI 1666.1 to 155.1). In the discussion section of this paper it was estimated that the cost per term pregnancy would be EUR 14,489 for gonadotrophin and EUR 11,301 for ovarian drilling followed by medical induction therapy, if necessary (22% lower). The higher rates of multiple pregnancies in the gonadotrophin group were considered to be responsible for the increased costs. The long-term costs at 10 years follow-up were reported in a 2011 economic analysis of the study by <LINK REF="STD-Bayram-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Bayram 2004</LINK>. The costs were significantly lower for the treatment strategy starting with electrocautery when compared to the gonadotrophin strategy (mean difference EUR 2235; 95% CI 80 to 3790). Refer to <LINK REF="CMP-001.07" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.7</LINK>.</P>
<P>The costs associated with <LINK REF="STD-Farquhar-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Farquhar 2002 </LINK>were reported in a 2004 publication. The authors reported that the costs of a live birth were one third lower in the group that underwent laparoscopic ovarian diathermy compared to those women who received gonadotrophins (NZD 19,640 and NZD 29,836, respectively). The costs were based on hospital and clinic direct and indirect costs. No estimates of a standard deviation were reported so these data have not been included in the analysis. Refer to <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Kaya-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Kaya 2005</LINK> reported that the costs of LOD were almost half that of treatment with gonadotrophins ($1081  234 versus $2214  356).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Palomba-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Palomba 2004</LINK> reported that LOD was significantly (P &lt; 0.05) more expensive than metformin treatment in a six-month treatment programme (EUR 1050 versus EUR 50 respectively). Refer to <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>.</P>

<P>As there was no evidence of a difference for ongoing pregnancy for either treatment option, laparoscopic ovarian drilling may be the treatment of choice since the avoidance of unnecessary gonadotrophins may reduce the risk of multiple pregnancies and ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome. There were no multiple pregnancies in either arm in <LINK REF="STD-Farquhar-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Farquhar 2002</LINK>, which may be due to the monitoring and high cancellation rate. On the other hand, although surgically-related complications associated with ovarian drilling seem rare, a case of pelvic infection following laparoscopic ovarian drilling highlights the need for caution in offering this treatment over gonadotrophin therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Deans-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deans 1997</LINK>). There are also the associated risks and morbidity of laparoscopy under general anaesthetic, postoperative adhesion formation (<LINK REF="STD-Greenblatt-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Greenblatt 1993</LINK>), and the as yet theoretical long-term risk of premature ovarian failure to be considered.</P>
<P>Although ovarian drilling is successful in inducing ovulation in a proportion of women and in improving the responsiveness of the ovary to ovulation induction agents, it is unknown how long it has an effect on the ovary. Repeated spontaneous ovulations and further pregnancies after the first pregnancy or miscarriage were reported by <LINK REF="STD-Farquhar-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Farquhar 2002</LINK>, which is an additional benefit of surgery. The need for monitoring in ovarian induction with gonadotrophins also makes surgery an attractive option. In addition, consumer preference and cost implications may favour this form of treatment for women with anovulatory PCOS wishing to conceive in the future. There is no evidence to support surgical treatment for other clinical symptoms of PCOS such as hirsutism.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2012-01-07 00:51:00 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is no evidence of a difference between laparoscopic ovarian drilling (with or without medical ovulation induction) compared to ovulation induction with gonadotrophins for women with polycystic ovarian syndrome and clomiphene resistance for the outcomes of pregnancy and ovulation after 12 months follow-up. Multiple pregnancy rates are reduced with ovarian drilling compared with other medical treatments. However, with the exception of multiple pregnancies, the few randomised studies thus far cannot rule out differences in outcomes. With regard to adhesion formation, there is insufficient evidence to favour any one surgical technique over another. Therefore, until more data become available, the clinical decision as to which treatment to recommend could be made on other considerations such as local facilities, adverse effects, cost and consumer preference.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2012-01-07 00:52:15 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Further RCTs should consider the role of laparoscopic ovarian drilling in association with medical ovulation induction. Studies should not just evaluate the outcomes of live birth and pregnancy rates but should also include outcomes such as ease of medical ovulation induction, adverse effects (such as overstimulation, ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome, multiple pregnancy, miscarriage and surgical complications), cost benefit analyses and consumer satisfaction. The long-term benefits (spontaneous resumption of ovulation and menstruation) and potential risks of laparoscopic ovarian drilling (such as premature ovarian failure) also need to be addressed. Further trials on the techniques of ovarian drilling (including the number of holes) could also be considered.</P>

<P>The protocol states that eligible participants were subfertile women with clomiphene-resistant PCOS. Although the term 'clomiphene-resistant' is not defined in the review, it is generally accepted to mean that women have not responded with proven ovulation to the use of clomiphene. Clomiphene failure, on the other hand, means that women have ovulated on clomiphene but have failed to achieve a successful outcome. In my opinion, the meta-analysis has therefore incorrectly included the study of Abu Hashim et al (Abu Hashim et al, 2011b), as participants int hsi study were infertile women with clomiphene citrate failure rather than clomiphene-resistance. (Summary of comments received from Associate Professor Luk Rombauts)</P>

<FEEDBACK_REPLY MODIFIED="2012-08-06 17:21:43 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The authors agree that Abu Hashim 2011b should not have been included in this review and we have now excluded this study. We have also added a definition of clomiphene resistance in the Methods section. We would like to thank Associate Professor Rombauts for his comments.</P>
