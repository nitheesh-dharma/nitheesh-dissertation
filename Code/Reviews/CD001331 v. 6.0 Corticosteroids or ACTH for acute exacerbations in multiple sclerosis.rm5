<P>This review is un update of the Cochrane Review, "Corticosteroids or ACTH for acute exacerbations in multiple sclerosis," first published in <I>The Cochrane Library</I> 2000, Issue 4.</P>
<P>Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic disease of the nervous system. Focal inflammation impairs the ability of white matter tracts to conduct electrical impulses and produces acute episodes of neurological dysfunction called <I>relapses</I>. During a relapse of the disease, the symptoms may cause different levels of impairment with variable recovery. Relapse-related sequelae may accumulate during the course of the disease and cause permanent disability. Disability is commonly evaluated according to the Kurtzke scale, which is scored over a range of 10 points (0 = no disability, 10 = death).</P>
<P>Corticosteroids reduce the inflammation in the brain and the spinal cord and are the first drugs of choice to treat exacerbations of MS. The objective of this review was to determine the efficacy of corticosteroids or adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) versus no treatment (placebo) in decreasing disability in MS patients affected by acute relapse. Prevention of long-term morbidity was also evaluated. Secondary objectives were to assess the safety and efficacy of different types of drugs and different schedules of treatment.</P>
<P>Six studies published between 1961 and 1998 have been included, with a total of 377 participants.</P>
<P>The main results of this review show that corticosteroids (methylprednisolone (MP)) or ACTH favoured recovery from acute exacerbation, increasing by more than 60% the probability of ameliorating the episode within the first five weeks of treatment. Clinical recovery was found to be accelerated and reduction of disability was assessed as a 1.5-point change in EDSS score during the first week of therapy. The quality of evidence was moderate. The drugs were well tolerated.</P>
<P>No clear data on long-term effects were found.</P>
<P>Evidence on the efficacy of different types or schedules of therapies was limited. Indirect comparisons suggest a significantly greater effect of MP versus ACTH. A short-term course (5 days) of MP seems to be more effective than long-term treatment (15 days). The interval between exacerbation onset and the start of treatment does not seem to influence the outcome.</P>
<P>Overall, this review provides evidence to support the use of corticosteroids in treating relapses in people with MS. These agents are effective over the short term in improving symptoms, thus favouring recovery.</P>

<P>Six trials, published between 1961 and 1998, contributed to this review. The current update did not identify new trials. A total of 377 participants (199 treatment, 178 placebo) were randomly assigned. The drugs analysed were methylprednisolone (MP) (four trials, 140 participants) and ACTH (two trials, 237 participants). Overall, administration of MP or ACTH favoured recovery from acute exacerbation in MS participants: use of either agent decreased by more than 60% the probability of the condition getting worse or stable within the first five weeks of treatment (odds ratio (OR) 0.37, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 0.24 to 0.57; reduced disability of 1.5 points in the Kurtzke Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score at the first week of therapy, mean difference -1.47, 95% CI -2.25 to -0.69). The overall quality of evidence according to GRADE levels was moderate. Evidence was insufficient to show whether steroids or ACTH treatment prevented new exacerbations and worsening of long-term disability. Indirect comparisons suggest a significantly greater effect of MP versus ACTH, with MP conferring greater benefit compared with ACTH (OR 0.20, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.45 vs OR 0.46, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.77), and with intravenous MP proving more effective than oral MP (OR 0.12, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.42 vs OR 0.29, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.89) in decreasing the risk of getting worse or stable within the first five weeks of treatment. The time interval from onset of exacerbation to start of treatment administration does not seem to influence the outcome. Short-term (five days) courses of intravenous MP seem to be more effective than long-term treatment (15 days) (OR 0.13, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.75 vs OR 0.22, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.57). No data are available beyond one year of follow-up to allow evaluation of any effect on long-term progression. One study reported that short-term treatment with intravenous high-dose MP was not associated with adverse events. However, gastrointestinal symptoms and affective disorders were significantly more common in the oral high-dose MP group than in the placebo group. Weight gain and edema were significantly more frequent in the ACTH group than among controls.<BR/>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2013-10-22 12:28:03 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review is un update of the Cochrane Review, "Corticosteroids or ACTH for acute exacerbations in multiple sclerosis," first published in <I>The Cochrane Library</I> 2000, Issue 4.</P>
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2013-10-21 09:59:02 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (CNS) whose aetiology and pathogenesis are still to be clarified. Both genetic and environmental factors seem to determine susceptibility to the disease (<LINK REF="REF-Compston-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Compston 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Willer-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Willer 2000</LINK>).<BR/>
</P>
<P>MS is a relatively rare disease (incidence of 2 to 10 cases per 100,000 persons per year; in Europe, Canada and the United States, prevalence rates range between 60 and more than 100 cases per 100,000 inhabitants) (<LINK REF="REF-Pugliatti-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pugliatti 2002</LINK>
;
 <LINK REF="REF-WHO-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2008</LINK>) that affects young adults with nearly normal life expectancy. Consequently, it is one of the most common causes of disability in young adults. The most characteristic clinical feature is the occurrence of exacerbations, which can be defined as a clinical syndrome of acute or subacute onset, in the absence of fever or infection, that can last from days to months. Disability may occur if recovery from an exacerbation is not completed. When the clinical course between two exacerbations is stable, the patient is in the relapsing-remitting (RR) phase of the disease. In general, exacerbations are more frequent early in the course of the disease, and progressive worsening is more common in later stages (secondary progressive course (SP)) either with or without the occurrence of superimposed exacerbations. In a small proportion of patients, the disease is progressive from onset without (primary progressive (PP)) or with superimposed exacerbations (progressive relapsing (PR)) (<LINK REF="REF-Lublin-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lublin 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>During the initial stage of the inflammatory phase, lymphocytes with encephalitogenic potential are activated in the periphery by different factors not well clarified. These phenomena produce a breach in the blood-brain barrier (BBB), leading to infiltration of immune cells into the CNS and focal demyelination (<LINK REF="STD-Schweingruber-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Schweingruber 2011</LINK>). During an acute relapse, levels of pro-inflammatory mediators and trophic factors such as tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF&#945;) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) are increased, leading to tissue injury (<LINK REF="REF-Lindquist-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lindquist 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>BBB disruption is an early marker of a recent lesion of MS and can be demonstrated by means of gadolinium-DTPA (Gd-DTPA) with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Clinical findings in patients with MS are correlated with the detection of contrast-enhancing acute plaques through MRI techniques (<LINK REF="REF-Atalay-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Atalay 2005</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2013-10-21 10:01:05 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>ACTH is secreted from the anterior pituitary and stimulates the adrenal cortex. More specifically, it stimulates secretion of glucocorticoids such as cortisol, and it has little control over secretion of aldosterone, the other major steroid hormone from the adrenal cortex. Therapeutic use of ACTH has been proposed for infantile spasm, nephrotic syndrome and acute exacerbations of MS (<LINK REF="REF-Levine-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Levine 2012</LINK>).</P>
<P>Synthetic compounds, which have greater anti-inflammatory effects than ACTH and less effect on salt and water balance, are usually preferred for the treatment of inflammatory disorders. These compounds include dexamethasone, which is almost exclusively glucocorticoid in its actions, as well as prednisone, prednisolone, betamethasone, triamcinolone and methylprednisolone. Glucocorticoids are formulated in various types, including oral and injectable dosage forms.</P>
<P>Glucocorticoid medications have multiple mechanisms of action when used to treat demyelinating diseases. Most of the cellular and physiological effects of glucocorticoids occur via the glucocorticoid receptor (one member of a nuclear receptor superfamily). They impact gene transcription through several different mechanisms and are potentially involved in the modulation of neuro-inflammation, including induction of apoptosis, repression of pro-inflammatory mediators and expansion of suppressor cells. Corticosteroids reduce the inflammatory response by inducing several effects on the immune system. They inhibit lymphocyte proliferation and cell-mediated immune response; decrease circulating T helper cells, eosinophils and monocytes; down-regulate cytokine gene expression; suppress synthesis of pro-inflammatory mediators, including interferon-&#947; and TNF&#945;; and inhibit the expression of class II histocompatibility antigens on the macrophage surface (<LINK REF="STD-Schweingruber-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Schweingruber 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>Moreover, these drugs have independent effects on BBB permeability and on neural tissue (<LINK REF="REF-McEwen-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">McEwen 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sapolsky-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sapolsky 2000</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2013-10-21 11:39:41 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Therapeutic strategies have been directed at treating the exacerbation, preventing new exacerbations and avoiding progression of disability. Treatment of exacerbations since the 1950s has been based on the use of ACTH and corticosteroids (<LINK REF="REF-Glaser-1951" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glaser 1951</LINK>).</P>
<P>Glucocorticoid treatments are commonly used in clinical practice because different studies have demonstrated their efficacy in improving the speed of functional recovery of participants with acute MS relapses (<LINK REF="REF-Tremlett-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tremlett 1998</LINK>) and in inducing clinical improvement in RR MS participants. This effect seems to be correlated with reduced inflammation and myelin breakdown, indicating that the action of glucocorticoids is accompanied by improved BBB integrity (<LINK REF="REF-Barkhof--1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barkhof 1992</LINK>). The effect of corticosteroids in suppressing Gd-enhanced MRI disease activity has been confirmed: MP is effective in reducing Gd-enhancing lesions in MS patients soon after an acute relapse (<LINK REF="REF-Martinelli-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Martinelli 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>The probability of improvement after MP treatment in optic neuritis (ON) or in attacks of MS seems to be higher among patients with enhancing lesions on baseline MRI. MP treatment suppressed Gd enhancement after one week (P &lt; 0.001) and three weeks (P = 0.001), showing that resolution of intrathecal inflammation is a major effect of methylprednisolone (<LINK REF="REF-Sellebjerg--2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sellebjerg 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>Clinical improvement of MS patients with relapse following treatment with MP may be associated with an immediate, but not long-term, modification of serum levels of chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2 (CCL2) and Interleukin 12 (IL-12) (<LINK REF="REF-Rentzos--2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rentzos 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>These results support the use of MP treatment for MS relapses; MP induces immediate post-treatment and short-term effects on the immune system, along with clinical and radiological improvement. However, the long-term influence of MP treatment on the course of the disease remains uncertain (<LINK REF="REF-Mart_x00ed_nez_x002d_C_x00e1_ceres-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Martínez-Cáceres 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>The results of trials that analysed direct comparisons have shown no significant differences between ACTH and MP in both rate and degree of recovery after exacerbation (<LINK REF="REF-Thompson-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thompson 1989</LINK>). Uncertainty is ongoing regarding the best type and regimen of corticosteroids for the treatment of patients with MS (<LINK REF="REF-Repovic-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Repovic 2011</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2013-10-21 11:41:10 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Several narrative reviews have been published on the use of corticosteroids or ACTH in MS, but the results of all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating their effects versus placebo had never been systematically reviewed.</P>
<P>Uncertainty continues regarding the type, the dosage and the best regimen of corticosteroids for the treatment of patients with MS. Furthermore, no conclusive information is available on optimal timing of the start of treatment in relation to relapse onset and on how long the therapeutic effect may persist.</P>
<P>Different treatment regimens are prescribed in clinical practice (<LINK REF="REF-Morrow-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morrow 2009</LINK>) because no convincing evidence suggests that clinical benefit is influenced by the route of administration or the dosage of glucocorticoid, or by the type of glucocorticoid prescribed.</P>
<P>The results of trials using direct comparisons have shown no significant differences between ACTH and MP in terms of rate and degree of recovery after exacerbation (<LINK REF="REF-Thompson-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thompson 1989</LINK>). However, other studies have shown that MP leads to faster recovery than ACTH, and that high doses of MP are more effective than lower doses in both clinical and MRI outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-Repovic-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Repovic 2011</LINK>), A previous study (<LINK REF="REF-Barnes-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barnes 1997</LINK>) and a systematic review (SR) (<LINK REF="REF-Burton-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burton 2012</LINK>) comparing intravenous versus oral steroid therapy for MS relapses did not demonstrate any significant differences in clinical (benefits and adverse events), radiological or pharmacological outcomes.</P>
<P>A recent SR (<LINK REF="REF-Gal-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gal 2012</LINK>) conducted to evaluate the efficacy of steroids in optic neuritis (ON) reported that no conclusive evidence suggests benefit in terms of return to normal visual acuity, visual field or contrast sensitivity with intravenous or oral corticosteroids versus placebo in acute ON at six and 12 months of follow-up.</P>
<P>An SR based on three trials (<LINK REF="REF-Ciccone-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ciccone 2008</LINK>), all classified as having high risk of bias, concluded that evidence is insufficient to show that long-term corticosteroid treatment delays progression of long-term disability in MS patients: Only one study showed that administration of pulsed high-dose intravenous MP is associated with a significant reduction in the risk of long-term disability progression in patients with RR MS. The authors suggested the need for further adequately powered, high-quality RCTs.</P>

<P>Two review authors (FB, GF) independently extracted data from the selected trials using standardised forms. A third review author (AC) cross-checked the data, and disagreements were resolved through consensus. We sought data on the number of participants with each outcome event, by allocated treatment group, irrespective of compliance, and whether or not the patient subsequently was deemed ineligible or otherwise was excluded from treatment or follow-up, to allow an "intention-to-treat" analysis. We extracted the numbers of worse or unimproved participants and of participants with new exacerbations during follow-up by allocated treatment groups. We also extracted the mean and SD of EDSS in treatment and placebo groups during follow-up. If available, we extracted data on the delay from exacerbation onset to trial entry, the type of steroid regimen used, the presence of confounders and the type and severity of adverse reactions. We also sought data on MRI results reported in the allocated treatment groups at different follow-up times.<BR/>

<B>TREATMENT OF ACUTE EXACERBATION</B>
</P>
<P>1. Participants worsened or unimproved within five weeks from randomisation.</P>
<P>Data from five trials (<LINK REF="STD-Miller-1961a" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 1961a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rose-1970" TYPE="STUDY">Rose 1970</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Durelli-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Durelli 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Milligan-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Milligan 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sellebjerg-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Sellebjerg 1998</LINK>) with 330 participants (87% of participants included in the review) were available on this outcome. ACTH or MP therapy was associated with a significant reduction in the risk of worsening or no improvement within five weeks (Peto odds ratio (OR) 0.37, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 0.24 to 0.57). In absolute terms, this means that 257 more participants improved for every 1000 participants treated with corticosteroids or ACTH (95% CI 144 to 349 improved). No statistically significant heterogeneity for this outcome was noted among the studies.</P>
<P>A prespecified sensitivity analysis showed no statistically significant difference in the effects of treatment on the likelihood of worsening or not improving at final follow-up when participants, who were randomly assigned to treatment and then excluded, were considered as worst outcome events (number of events in treated participants = 65/177; number of events in controls = 94/156; OR 0.39, 95% CI 0.25 to 0.60).</P>
<P>2. Mean disability score at one week and at four weeks from randomisation.</P>
<P>Two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Milligan-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Milligan 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Filipovic-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Filipovic 1997</LINK>) including 62 participants (16% of participants included in the review) reported disability score at one week from randomisation.

<P>3. Time to start of improvement.</P>
<P>One study (<LINK REF="STD-Durelli-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Durelli 1986</LINK>) including 21 participants (only 6% of participants included in the review) reported data on this outcome. The time to improvement was shorter (mean 32 days, SD 9 days) in the intravenous MP group than in the control group (mean 45 days, SD 9 days). This result was statistically significant (Chi<SUP>2</SUP> = 3.29, P = 0.001).</P>

<P>Only one study (<LINK REF="STD-Sellebjerg-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Sellebjerg 1998</LINK>) reported this outcome. Both at eight weeks and at one year from randomisation, fewer participants were worse off or unimproved in the MP group (9/26, 35% at eight weeks; 13/26, 50% at one year) than in the placebo group (17/25, 68% at eight weeks; 18/23, 78% at one year).

In absolute terms, an additional 394 participants (95% CI 213 to 576) were improved for every 1000 participants treated with MP compared with an additional 190 participants (95% CI 66 to 313 improved) treated with ACTH (<LINK REF="CMP-002.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.1</LINK>).</P>
<P>2. Worse or unimproved within five weeks from randomisation BY LENGTH OF TREATMENT.</P>
<P>This indirect comparison was possible only in some trials and showed a slight benefit from short versus long duration of treatment (<LINK REF="CMP-002.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.2</LINK>).</P>
<P>This outcome was observed in 3/13 (23%) participants allocated to short-term treatment (five days) with MP and in 6/8 (75%) participants allocated to placebo (Chi<SUP>2</SUP>= 2.28, P = 0.02) (<LINK REF="STD-Milligan-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Milligan 1987</LINK>).<BR/>A significant reduction in the risk of this outcome was observed also with long-term MP treatment (15 days): 1/11 (9%) MP participants versus 6/10 (60%) control participants (<LINK REF="STD-Durelli-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Durelli 1986</LINK>) and 12/26 (46%) MP participants versus 19/25 (76%) control participants (<LINK REF="STD-Sellebjerg-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Sellebjerg 1998</LINK>) worsened or unimproved within five weeks from randomisation.</P>
<P>3. Worse or unimproved within five weeks from randomisation BY ROUTE OF ADMINISTRATION.</P>
<P>MP administered intravenously showed some but not a significantly greater effect than oral MP (<LINK REF="CMP-002.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.3</LINK> ): 3/13 (23%) intravenous MP versus 6/8 (75%) placebo participants (<LINK REF="STD-Milligan-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Milligan 1987</LINK>), 1/11 (9%) intravenous MP versus 6/10 (60%) control participants (<LINK REF="STD-Durelli-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Durelli 1986</LINK>) and 12/26 (46%) oral MP versus 19/25 (76%) control participants (<LINK REF="STD-Sellebjerg-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Sellebjerg 1998</LINK>) had this outcome.</P>
<P>4. Worse or unimproved within five weeks from randomisation BY THE TIME OF START OF TREATMENT FROM EXACERBATION ONSET.</P>
<P>The frequency of this outcome was similarly reduced in participants who received treatment within two weeks in 11/22 (50%) ACTH participants versus 14/18 (78%) placebo participants (<LINK REF="STD-Miller-1961a" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 1961a</LINK>); within four weeks in 12/26 (46%) MP participants versus 19/25 (76%) placebo participants (<LINK REF="STD-Sellebjerg-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Sellebjerg 1998</LINK>); within eight weeks in 1/11 (9%) MP participants versus 6/10 (60%) placebo participants (<LINK REF="STD-Durelli-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Durelli 1986</LINK>); in 3/13 (23%) MP participants versus 6/8 (75%) placebo participants (<LINK REF="STD-Milligan-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Milligan 1987</LINK>); or in 36/103 (35%) ACTH participants versus 49/94 (52%) placebo participants (<LINK REF="STD-Rose-1970" TYPE="STUDY">Rose 1970</LINK>). However, these comparisons may be confounded by drug and route of administration.</P>
<P>5. Worse or unimproved within five weeks from randomisation BY TYPE OF DISEASE COURSE.</P>
<P>Overall, MP or ACTH showed a protective effect in participants with an RR course at randomisation (<LINK REF="STD-Rose-1970" TYPE="STUDY">Rose 1970</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Durelli-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Durelli 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Milligan-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Milligan 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sellebjerg-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Sellebjerg 1998</LINK>). Only one author reported that participants treated during an acute exacerbation that took a progressively worse course did not show a difference compared with control participants (20/33 ACTH participants vs 20/33 placebo participants) (<LINK REF="STD-Rose-1970" TYPE="STUDY">Rose 1970</LINK>).</P>

</P>
<P>1. Gastrointestinal symptoms.</P>
<P>In the trial with intramuscular ACTH (<LINK REF="STD-Rose-1970" TYPE="STUDY">Rose 1970</LINK>), peptic ulcer or gastrointestinal bleeding was reported in 1/103 (1%) ACTH and 3/94 (3%) placebo participants. Gastrointestinal bleeding was not reported in the trials using high-dose intravenous MP (<LINK REF="STD-Durelli-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Durelli 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Milligan-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Milligan 1987</LINK>), but high-dose oral MP (<LINK REF="STD-Sellebjerg-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Sellebjerg 1998</LINK>) was associated with high risk of gastrointestinal symptoms (OR 5.26, 95% CI 1.46 to 18.94) (<LINK REF="CMP-003.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.1</LINK>).</P>
<P>2. Affective disorders including insomnia.</P>
<P>These symptoms were significantly more frequent in MP participants (22%) than in controls (11%). Affective disorders were described as " elevated mood and insomnia" in 5/11 (45%) in the long-term intravenous MP group and in 3/10 (30%) in the control group (<LINK REF="STD-Durelli-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Durelli 1986</LINK>); "psychosis" in 1/9 (11%) in the control group (<LINK REF="STD-Milligan-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Milligan 1987</LINK>); "dysphoria" in 6/26 (23%) in the oral MP group and in 1/25 (4%) in the control group; or "insomnia" in 17/26 (65%) in the MP group and in 2/25 (8%) in the control group (<LINK REF="STD-Sellebjerg-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Sellebjerg 1998</LINK>).<BR/>
</P>
<P>Affective disorders (severe anxiety or severe depression) occurred at an equivalent rate in the ACTH group (2/103; 1%) and in the control group (1/94; 1%) (<LINK REF="STD-Rose-1970" TYPE="STUDY">Rose 1970</LINK>). The risk for MP was OR 2.37 (95% CI 0.77 to 7.23) and for ACTH 1.79 (95% CI 0.18 to 17.46)&#8212;not significant for both drugs.</P>
<P>3. Weight gain and oedema.</P>
<P>These adverse events were reported more often in treated participants (11%) than in controls (2%); however, the ACTH trials greatly accounted for the increased frequency of these adverse events.</P>
<P>4. Hypertension.</P>
<P>In the largest trial (<LINK REF="STD-Rose-1970" TYPE="STUDY">Rose 1970</LINK>), hypertension developed in 2/103 (2%) in the ACTH group and in none of the participants in the control group. Hypertension was not reported in the three trials with MP (<LINK REF="STD-Durelli-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Durelli 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Milligan-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Milligan 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sellebjerg-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Sellebjerg 1998</LINK>).</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-10-21 10:21:01 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The primary aim of this review was to determine whether ACTH or corticosteroids reduced short-term disability after an exacerbation, prevented new exacerbations and reduced long-term disability. The secondary aims were to determine whether different drugs or regimens of corticosteroids had different effects.</P>
<P>All six trials included in this review showed a homogeneous pattern suggestive of benefit of ACTH or MP treatment: The probability of amelioration within the first five weeks of treatment was increased by more than 60%, and the mean decline in the EDSS score after one week of therapy was 1.5 points.</P>
<P>This review provides quantitative evidence favouring ACTH or MP against placebo for treating symptoms of an acute exacerbation in patients with multiple sclerosis (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>).</P>
<P>Evidence was insufficient to allow review authors to determine whether steroids or ACTH treatment prevented new exacerbations and worsening of long-term disability.</P>
<P>The indirect comparisons indicated that MP may confer greater benefit compared with ACTH, and that intravenous MP administration may provide greater effect than oral MP administration in improving the probability of amelioration within the first five weeks of treatment.</P>
<P>Safety data, reported in four trials, indicate gastric disturbances that required symptomatic treatment, affective disorders and insomnia frequently noted after oral MP and hypertension, weight gain and oedema, which were significantly more frequent in the ACTH group than in controls.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2013-10-21 11:54:49 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Evidence obtained in this review is limited to a small number of included participants (377), 197 (52%) of whom were included in the largest and most influential trial (<LINK REF="STD-Rose-1970" TYPE="STUDY">Rose 1970</LINK>). We were unsure that randomisation was well conducted in all trials, as allocation concealment was unclearly reported in all studies. In spite of these limitations, no statistically significant heterogeneity was noted for the primary outcome: All trials showed a benefit of ACTH or MP treatment within the first five weeks of treatment. In four trials, the principal outcome measure was the EDSS score, which is commonly used in clinical practice to assess the functional limitations suffered by patients (<LINK REF="STD-Durelli-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Durelli 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Milligan-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Milligan 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Filipovic-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Filipovic 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sellebjerg-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Sellebjerg 1998</LINK>). The EDSS score was between four and six, suggesting that studied relapsing participants did not represent the complete range of disability. In the largest study (<LINK REF="STD-Rose-1970" TYPE="STUDY">Rose 1970</LINK>), disability was scored by using the DSS scale, and Miller (<LINK REF="STD-Miller-1961a" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 1961a</LINK>) used a subjective evaluation of outcome, with its classification fulfilling the outcome criteria of this review.</P>
<P>The data provide quantitative evidence supporting the use of either drug&#8212;ACTH or MP&#8212;for the treatment of acute exacerbation in MS patients in reducing short-term disability and hastening recovery.</P>
<P>Evidence was insufficient to allow determination of whether steroids or ACTH treatment prevents new exacerbations and worsening of long-term disability. In fact, only one study (<LINK REF="STD-Sellebjerg-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Sellebjerg 1998</LINK>) (with 51 participants) reported data after one year of follow-up, showing no difference between oral MP and placebo in prevention of new exacerbations or improvement in disability.<BR/>
<BR/>The secondary objective of this review was to evaluate whether the effect of treatment of acute exacerbation changed according to different drugs, doses, routes of administration, length of treatment and interval of time between onset of symptoms and start of treatment, and according to course of disease. Evidence was limited because the number of participants was small and only indirect comparisons were undertaken. MP seems to be more effective than ACTH (OR 0.20, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.45 vs OR 0.46, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.77), and intravenous MP administration may provide better benefit than oral MP administration (OR 0.12, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.42vs OR 0.29, 95% CI 010 to 0.89). Regarding the safety profile, gastrointestinal and affective symptoms occurred more frequently in the MP group, and mineral corticosteroid effects were reported in the ACTH group.</P>
<P>As far as length of treatment is concerned, short-term courses of intravenous MP (5 days' treatment with 0.5 to 1 g/d) (<LINK REF="STD-Milligan-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Milligan 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Filipovic-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Filipovic 1997</LINK>) may confer an equivalent or slightly better benefit than long-term intravenous MP treatment (1 g daily for three days with subsequent taper over 12 days) (<LINK REF="STD-Durelli-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Durelli 1986</LINK>) or long-term oral MP treatment (0.5 g daily for five days with taper over 10 days) (<LINK REF="STD-Sellebjerg-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Sellebjerg 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>Indirect comparisons by interval of time before the start of treatment from exacerbation onset might suggest that a time interval within 2 to 4 or 8 weeks did not significantly influence the outcome.</P>
<P>We were not able to evaluate the effect of corticosteroids or ACTH on MRI as a surrogate marker of disease activity for lack of data. Measures of MRI were reported in a post hoc study (<LINK REF="REF-Sellebjerg--2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sellebjerg 2003</LINK>) based on subgroups of participants with ON or attacks of MS, as included in two previously published RCTs (<LINK REF="STD-Sellebjerg-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Sellebjerg 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sellebjerg-1999b" TYPE="STUDY">Sellebjerg 1999b</LINK>). The OR of improving after one week was better after MP treatment than after placebo and at eight weeks was significantly better only in participants with enhancing lesions on MRI at baseline.</P>
<P>It is widely accepted that during an acute exacerbation of multiple sclerosis, patients should be treated with steroids; because of their role in speeding up recovery (<LINK REF="REF-Repovic-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Repovic 2011</LINK>), intravenous high doses of MP are the most commonly proposed schedule of treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Tremlett-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tremlett 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sellebierg-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sellebierg 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>Use of ACTH in MS is largely of historical interest. For acute exacerbations, ACTH has mostly been replaced by intravenous MP, with less retention of salt and water and less virilisation.(<LINK REF="REF-Schimmer-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schimmer 2001</LINK>). The safety profile was also confirmed by our data. ACTH rapidly disappears from the circulation after its intravenous administration, and plasma half-life is about 15 minutes. The ACTH labelling information has been recently revised, including information on the treatment of infantile spasms (<LINK REF="REF-FDA-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">FDA 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>It should be noted that a recent study has proposed the use of ACTH as long-term treatment for MS. This study evaluated the efficacy and safety of monthly pulse ACTH treatment added to &#946;-interferon for breakthrough MS, compared with pulse MP, in 23 participants. Twelve participants were randomly allocated to open-label ACTH (80 U intramuscularly once per day for 3 consecutive days) and 11 to MP (1 g intravenously in 1 dose) for 12 months. During this time, participants receiving ACTH had fewer relapses than those given MP (<LINK REF="REF-Brooks-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brooks 2013</LINK>).</P>

<P>Two systematic reviews evaluating the efficacy of steroids in the prevention of long-term disability in MS (<LINK REF="REF-Ciccone-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ciccone 2008</LINK>) and comparing intravenous versus oral MP treatment in MS relapses have been published (<LINK REF="REF-Burton-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burton 2012</LINK>).</P>
<P>Our results show no definitive conclusion for long-term efficacy of a single pulse steroid treatment: The prevention of new exacerbations was mentioned only in a small trial included in this review (<LINK REF="STD-Sellebjerg-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Sellebjerg 1998</LINK>), which reported a similar outcome in the MP and placebo groups. The Ciccone review (<LINK REF="STD-Ciccone-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Ciccone 1998</LINK>) included three trials, all classified as having high risk of bias and including 183 participants (91 treated). Corticosteroid therapy did not reduce the risk of worsening at the end of follow-up (OR 0.51, 95% CI 0.26 to 1.02), but substantial heterogeneity was noted between studies (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 78.4%). Intravenous periodic high-dose MP was associated with a significant reduction in the risk of disability progression at 5 years in RR MS (OR 0.26, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.66). Oral continuous low-dose prednisolone was not associated with any risk reduction at 18 months (OR 1.23, 95% CI 0.43 to 3.56). The risk of experiencing at least one exacerbation at the end of follow-up was not significantly reduced (OR 0.36, 95% CI 0.10 to 1.25).<BR/>
</P>
<P>Our review suggests that intravenous administration may provide greater effect than oral MP, reducing the risk of worsening at 5 weeks. However, we compared only two studies (42 participants) for intravenous MP and one study (51 participants) for oral administration, and only indirect comparisons were possible. A recent review (<LINK REF="REF-Burton-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burton 2012</LINK>) included five studies (215 participants) and compared intravenous versus oral MP treatment. It showed no significant difference in relapse recovery at week four (mean difference -0.22, 95% CI -0.71 to 0.26; P = 0.20) nor differences in MRI activity. However, because only two of the five studies employed more rigorous methodological techniques, the results must be taken with some caution.</P>

<P>It is widely accepted that acute exacerbation in MS patients should be treated with steroids or ACTH (<LINK REF="REF-Meyers-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meyers 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Repovic-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Repovic 2011</LINK>); intravenous high doses of MP are the most commonly used therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Tremlett-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tremlett 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sellebierg-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sellebierg 2005</LINK>). This review provides quantitative evidence favouring ACTH or MP versus placebo for treating acute symptoms of patients with MS.</P>
<P>Overall the data suggest that MP is the most effective drug, and that short-term intravenous administration can be the most appropriate schedule free of relevant adverse effects. Steroids allow recovery from disability if started within 8 weeks from the onset of relapse.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2013-10-21 13:01:29 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Liliana Coco">
<P>This review gives clear conclusive evidence on the efficacy of steroids versus placebo in the treatment of patients with acute MS relapse. Over the past ten years, no new trials evaluating the effect of steroids versus placebo in this population have been published. Use of corticosteroids is currently the standard treatment for acute MS exacerbation, and trials evaluating their effects versus those of placebo are now unacceptable for ethical reasons.</P>
<P>To answer questions on best schedules of treatment in terms of dosages and timing from relapse onset, systematic reviews comparing different types of steroids and schedules of treatments are warranted. The issue regarding evaluation of clinically relevant outcomes, such as patient-oriented outcome measures and MRI markers of disease activity, remains unresolved. Long-term follow-up is ensured.</P>
