<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2011-03-01 16:20:49 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Following surgery most surgical wounds heal naturally with no complications. However, complications such as infection and wound dehiscence (opening) can occur which may result in delayed healing or wound breakdown. Infected surgical wounds may contain dead (devitalised) tissue. Removal of this dead tissue (debridement) from surgical wounds is believed to enable wound healing. Many methods are available to clinicians to debride surgical wounds. This review showed that there is insufficient valid research evidence to recommend any one particular method.</P>
<P>There is a clear need for more research into which method is most effective in removing dead tissue from surgical wounds that have become infected.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2011-03-01 16:20:44 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Five RCTs (159 participants) were eligible for inclusion; all compared treatments for infected surgical wounds and reported time required to achieve a clean wound bed (complete debridement). One trial compared an enzymatic agent (streptokinase/streptodornase) with saline-soaked dressings. Four trials compared the effectiveness of dextranomer beads or paste with other products (different comparator in each trial) to achieve complete debridement. Meta-analysis was not possible due to the unique comparisons within each trial. One trial reported that dextranomer achieved a clean wound bed significantly more quickly than Eusol, and one trial comparing enzymatic debridement with saline-soaked dressings reported that the enzyme-treated wounds were cleaned more quickly. However, methodological quality was poor in these two trials.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2011-03-01 16:21:05 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Surgical wounds, by definition, are initially acute and most heal naturally without delay or complications (<LINK REF="REF-Bale-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bale 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Baxter-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baxter 2003</LINK>). However, complications such as infection and wound dehiscence (opening) may occur, and may result in either delayed wound healing or wound breakdown, or both. Wounds with surgical site infections may contain devitalised (dead) tissue. The appearance, colour and texture of this tissue may vary from hard, black tissue (necrotic or eschar) to a soft fibrous yellow or green tissue (slough) (<LINK REF="REF-Thomas-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thomas 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vowden-1999a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vowden 1999a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ramundo-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ramundo 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stotts-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stotts 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Brien-2003a" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Brien 2003a</LINK>). This may be accompanied by increased production of fluid (exudate) and the presence of an odour (<LINK REF="REF-Dealey-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dealey 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Brien-2003a" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Brien 2003a</LINK>).</P>
<P>There is a widely held belief that wound healing is impeded by the presence of devitalised, necrotic tissue and wounds containing such material do not heal successfully (<LINK REF="REF-Baharestani-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baharestani 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lewis-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lewis 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stotts-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stotts 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NICE-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Brien-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Brien 2002</LINK>). Non-viable tissue not only inhibits the growth of epithelial tissue, but also increases the production of exudate, impairs assessment of the wound bed, and makes it more difficult to achieve wound closure, thus having an adverse effect on quality of life (<LINK REF="REF-Baharestani-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baharestani 1999</LINK>). Although <LINK REF="REF-Baharestani-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baharestani 1999</LINK> details a number of reasons for the removal of the dead tissue (as detailed above), these reasons do not appear to be supported by robust, scientific evidence.</P>
<P>Debridement is the process whereby foreign material and dead or damaged tissue and debris are removed from a wound (<LINK REF="REF-Vowden-1999a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vowden 1999a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Brien-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Brien 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Brien-2003c" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Brien 2003c</LINK>). Debridement of wounds includes any method that removes infected or contaminated tissue, cell debris or dead, devitalised, fibrous material (frequently classified as eschar or slough) to create a clean wound bed (<LINK REF="REF-Vowden-1999a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vowden 1999a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NICE-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Brien-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Brien 2002</LINK>). Debridement is thought to provide a foundation for the subsequent healing of wounds (<LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Brien-2003b" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Brien 2003b</LINK>).</P>
<P>Debridement may be achieved by a variety of methods including: surgery; biosurgical (larvae) debridement; autolytic debridement; mechanical debridement; chemical debridement and enzymatic debridement.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Surgical or sharp debridement</HEADING>
<P>Surgical debridement may be achieved by the aggressive excision of all devitalised tissue using surgical techniques (<LINK REF="REF-Thomas-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thomas 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vowden-1999b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vowden 1999b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sibbald-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sibbald 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schultz-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schultz 2003</LINK>). Disadvantages associated with this method are the requirement for hospital admission, the administration of an anaesthetic with associated complications, and time in the operating theatre. It is also associated with pain, bleeding and excision of healthy tissue and, as such, is not suitable or desirable for all patients (<LINK REF="REF-Baharestani-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baharestani 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Thomas-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thomas 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vowden-1999b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vowden 1999b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sibbald-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sibbald 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schultz-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schultz 2003</LINK>). On the other hand, sharp debridement involves the excision of small quantities of dead tissue by a clinician using scissors or a scalpel (<LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Brien-2003a" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Brien 2003a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Brien-2003c" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Brien 2003c</LINK>). This procedure may be performed in a community or hospital setting (<LINK REF="REF-Poston-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Poston 1996</LINK>). However, for both surgical and sharp procedures, issues of patient consent, training and skill of the clinician must be considered (<LINK REF="REF-Ashworth-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ashworth 2002</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Biosurgical/biological debridement</HEADING>
<P>In biosurgical or biological debridement, sterile larvae (maggots) of the <I>Lucilia sericata </I>species of greenbottle fly are applied to a sloughy wound. There, the larvae are capable of producing powerful proteolytic enzymes that destroy the dead tissue by liquefying and ingesting it. Healthy tissue in the wound bed is not damaged and, although there are aesthetic considerations, larvae are increasingly being used for wound debridement (<LINK REF="REF-Baharestani-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baharestani 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lewis-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lewis 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Brien-2003a" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Brien 2003a</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Autolytic debridement</HEADING>
<P>Over time, naturally occurring enzymes will eventually break down and dissolve dead or sloughy tissue in wounds. This natural process is promoted by the maintenance of a moist environment through judicious use of dressings and topical agents (e.g. hydrogels, semi-occlusive and occlusive wound dressings). Many of these dressings hydrate and remove black, necrotic tissue and slough (<LINK REF="REF-Baharestani-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baharestani 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vowden-1999a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vowden 1999a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lewis-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lewis 2000</LINK>). Dextranomer is an example of a hydroscopic dressing which has a high absorptive capacity and is capable of removing bacteria, debris and absorbing wound exudate, thereby facilitating autolytic debridement. However worldwide production of dextranomer beads and paste was discontinued in 2007, with the exception of the paste which is still available in South Africa.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Mechanical debridement</HEADING>
<P>Mechanical methods of debridement are non-selective and may result in damage to healthy tissue (<LINK REF="REF-Baharestani-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baharestani 1999</LINK>). These methods include: wet to dry debridement, wound cleansing debridement and whirlpool debridement (<LINK REF="REF-Vowden-1999a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vowden 1999a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ramundo-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ramundo 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Brien-2003a" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Brien 2003a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stotts-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stotts 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Falabella-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Falabella 2006</LINK>).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Wet to dry debridement</HEADING>
<P>The wet to dry method of debridement involves the application of a saline-soaked gauze dressing to a wound. The moist dressing induces separation of the devitalised tissue and, once dry, the dressing is removed, together with the slough and necrotic tissue. This process is continued until all the devitalised tissue is removed. This is reported to be a painful procedure and may damage healthy tissue; fibres may be left in the wound and the dressing does not provide a barrier to bacterial contamination (<LINK REF="REF-Baharestani-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baharestani 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ramundo-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ramundo 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Brien-2003a" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Brien 2003a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stotts-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stotts 2004</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Wound cleansing debridement</HEADING>
<P>Wound cleansing debridement involves irrigating a wound with a continuous or intermittent flow of fluid delivered under high pressure. The force of the fluid is between 8 and 12 pounds per square inch (psi), and is sufficient to remove devitalised tissue and wound bacteria (<LINK REF="REF-Baharestani-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baharestani 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ramundo-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ramundo 2000</LINK>). Newer wound cleansing systems use pressurised saline delivered via a nozzle at between 12,800 and 15,000 psi (<LINK REF="STD-Granick-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Granick 2006</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Whirlpool debridement</HEADING>
<P>Whirlpool debridement is used for large wounds on the trunk or extremities. The affected person is immersed in a whirlpool bath, where the vigorous action of the water and its hydrating effect loosen the surface bacteria and devitalised tissue, and allow them to be washed away (<LINK REF="REF-Baharestani-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baharestani 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ramundo-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ramundo 2000</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Chemical debridement</HEADING>
<P>A range of chemical agents, including hypochlorites such as EUSOL (Edinburgh University Solution of Lime) and Dakin's Solution (sodium hypochlorite), hydrogen peroxide and iodine, have been used to promote debridement of wounds. The use of chemical agents remains a controversial area, in which any benefits need to be judged against any detrimental effects on the process of healing (<LINK REF="REF-Brennan-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brennan 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Baharestani-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baharestani 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hofman-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hofman 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ayello-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ayello 2004</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Enzymatic debridement</HEADING>
<P>Topical enzymatic preparations are applied to moist (or moistened) devitalised tissue. Such preparations include: streptokinase/streptodornase (<LINK REF="REF-Lewis-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lewis 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Brien-2003a" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Brien 2003a</LINK>), collagenase (<LINK REF="REF-Ramundo-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ramundo 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stotts-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stotts 2004</LINK>), papain/urea, and a combination of fibrinolysin and deoxyribonuclease (<LINK REF="REF-Ramundo-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ramundo 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stotts-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stotts 2004</LINK>). This method has a number of disadvantages, including a requirement for frequent dressing changes and a slow rate of debridement. Worldwide production of the enzymatic preparation of streptokinase/streptodornase has now been discontinued.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Overview</HEADING>
<P>There is considerable debate about the appropriateness and efficacy of debridement methods (<LINK REF="REF-Ashworth-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ashworth 2002</LINK>). A systematic review published in 1999 indicated that there were no studies comparing non debridement with debridement and therefore the benefits of debridement on wound healing were unclear (<LINK REF="REF-Bradley-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bradley 1999</LINK>). A guidance document on the use of debriding agents for difficult-to-heal surgical wounds highlighted the lack of sufficient evidence (and the corresponding absence of randomised controlled trials (RCTs)) to support any particular method of debridement (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2001</LINK>). However a Cochrane Review on the debridement of diabetic foot ulcers found evidence suggesting that the rate of healing increased when a hydrogel dressing was used in comparison to a gauze dressing (<LINK REF="REF-Edwards-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Edwards 2010</LINK>). The choice of debriding agent and method is usually made on the basis of the clinician's expertise and knowledge, the available resources and cost (<LINK REF="REF-Flanagan-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Flanagan 1999</LINK>). Since wound management choices, however, continue to increase, as do the cost of products, the choice of debridement method or agent should be guided by good evidence (<LINK REF="REF-Lewis-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lewis 2000</LINK>). An up-to-date review of debridement for surgical wounds is therefore necessary, to enable evidence-based clinical decision-making.</P>

<P>None of the titles or abstracts (425 citations) retrieved in the updated search were relevant to this review.</P>
<P>Our original 2008 search identified 2087 titles and abstracts. A total of 30 abstracts were potentially relevant and we obtained the full publications of these. Five of these publications were in languages other than English and after translation it was apparent that only one of these was a RCT. Two authors (ND and MM) independently read the publications and applied the inclusion and exclusion criteria. They made referral to a third author (JD) regarding three trials. Six RCTs were initially identified as having met the inclusion criteria (see '<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>' table); the randomisation status of one was unclear and the author did not respond to requests for further information (<LINK REF="STD-Zeitani-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Zeitani 2004</LINK>) therefore we excluded this trial (see '<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_EXCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of excluded studies</LINK>' table), leaving five included trials (<LINK REF="STD-Goode-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Goode 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sondergaard-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Sondergaard 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Young-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Young 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Poulson-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Poulson 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Michiels-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Michiels 1990</LINK>). All identified trials were published between 1979 and 1990; trial sizes ranged from 18 to 50 participants and, where reported, ages ranged from three years to 91 years. Small sample size was the main deficiency of the five trials and none of the trials reported an <I>a priori </I>sample size calculation.</P>
<P>All the trials compared treatments for infected post surgical wounds and, although the term debridement was mentioned in only one of the five trials(<LINK REF="STD-Michiels-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Michiels 1990</LINK>), each trial reported the time required to obtain a clean wound bed. As the debridement of wounds includes any method that removes infected or contaminated tissue, cell debris or devitalised material to create a clean bed, we considered the five trials eligible for inclusion in the review. The five trials entered people with post surgical wounds all described as infected, or at risk of infection, and reported that the wounds were either left open, or required opening and drainage for infection. Reporting of the type and site of the surgery and extent of the wound was variable. <LINK REF="STD-Poulson-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Poulson 1983</LINK> provided the most detailed breakdown of the type of surgery performed and inclusion criteria indicating the minimum length and depth of the wounds. <LINK REF="STD-Sondergaard-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Sondergaard 1982</LINK> reported inclusion of wounds involving the subcutaneous tissue and <LINK REF="STD-Young-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Young 1982</LINK> included wounds left open from the muscle layer outwards.

One trial compared the enzyme preparation of streptokinase/streptodornase with saline-soaked dressings (<LINK REF="STD-Poulson-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Poulson 1983</LINK>). Time to a clean wound bed was reported in all trials and was the primary outcome prior to wound closure or discharge from hospital (<LINK REF="STD-Goode-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Goode 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Poulson-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Poulson 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Michiels-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Michiels 1990</LINK>).

The trial reported no significant difference between the treatment and control groups for the resolution of erythema, oedema, necrotic tissue and the development of granulation tissue. The handling and reporting of the data for the pus and debris criteria were unclear and subjective and the groups were not comparable at baseline with respect to the amount of pus and debris. <LINK REF="STD-Michiels-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Michiels 1990</LINK> reports that dextranomer significantly reduced the time taken to clean the wound bed compared with polyvinylpyrrolidone.

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2011-04-11 17:30:27 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Despite the availability of a range of debridement methods (see <LINK TAG="BACKGROUND" TYPE="SECTION">Background</LINK>) and an increasing number of modern dressings, we identified only five poor-quality randomised controlled trials (RCTs), all conducted prior to 1990. Two methods of debridement were employed in the included studies: autolytic debridement using dextranomer and enzymatic debridement using streptokinase/streptodornase. It is important to note that no trials were identified by the search that compared debridement with no debridement of surgical wounds. This reflects earlier findings by <LINK REF="REF-Bradley-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bradley 1999</LINK> and apart from the findings of <LINK REF="REF-Edwards-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Edwards 2010</LINK>, who showed that the rate of healing of diabetic foot ulcers increased with a hydrogel dressing when compared with gauze, this review of the evidence would indicate that there is still little evidence to support the belief that debridement promotes wound healing. Also the merit of using gauze as a comparator could be questioned, as <LINK REF="REF-Pollard-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pollard 2008</LINK> would argue that most, if not all modern dressings would demonstrate improvement in healing when compared with gauze. However, in contrast <LINK REF="REF-Ubbink-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ubbink 2006</LINK> found that time to complete wound healing was similar when comparing occlusive with gauze-based dressings for surgical wounds. It is beyond the scope of this review to postulate reasons for the lack of trials comparing debridement with no debridement: perceived ethical considerations may be a barrier to the conducting of such RCTs.</P>
<P>Although only five RCTs conducted prior to 1990 met the inclusion criteria for this review, a range of more recent research papers were identified but following closer scrutiny were all excluded (see '<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_EXCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of excluded studies</LINK>' table). It is apparent from these excluded studies that a range of debridement methods are being used in clinical practice, including surgical debridement (<LINK REF="STD-Zeitani-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Zeitani 2004</LINK>) and mechanical debridement (<LINK REF="STD-Allie-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Allie 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Granick-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Granick 2006</LINK>), however these studies are not RCTs and therefore are highly susceptible to selection bias. It is disappointing that recently published studies are not employing more rigorous research methods that aim to minimise bias and therefore increase the confidence with which we can view the findings. The cost of conducting a RCT may be one consideration. Manufacturers of existing and new wound debridement products appear to use controlled trials, retrospective analysis of patient case notes and case studies as evidence of effectiveness.</P>
<P>The common outcome for the five included trials was time to a clean wound bed for infected post surgical wounds. Three out of the four trials comparing dextranomer with other products reported shorter time to a clean wound bed for dextranomer. The trial comparing streptokinase/streptodornase with saline dressings reported a shorter time to a clean wound bed with streptokinase/streptodornase.</P>
<P>However, a number of trial deficiencies reduce the confidence by which we can draw any conclusions to inform practice. These deficiencies include:</P>
<OL>
<LI>poor quality of the trials;</LI>
<LI>small sample sizes;</LI>
<LI>limited range of treatments;</LI>
<LI>different control groups for each trial;</LI>
<LI>lack of replication studies; and</LI>
<LI>inappropriate statistical analysis (time to event data not being analysed as such).</LI>
</OL>
<P>The methodological quality of the trials was variable, with small sample sizes, method of randomisation not always being clear, and inadequate allocation concealment. Data and statistical information were incomplete in three of the five trials. Blinding of the independent assessors would have been possible, but this was only clearly demonstrated in two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Goode-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Goode 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Poulson-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Poulson 1983</LINK>).</P>
<P>A limited range of treatments was identified with dextranomer beads or paste and different comparisons used in each trial, therefore it was not possible to pool the results. The rationale for choosing dextranomer for the treatment groups was not clear, apart from in <LINK REF="STD-Young-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Young 1982</LINK>, who identified this as a new dressing, the trial being supported financially by the manufacturer. Dextranomer was significantly better than Eusol-soaked dressings (<LINK REF="STD-Goode-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Goode 1979</LINK>) but this result must be viewed with caution, as there were insufficient statistical data included in the small trial and methodological flaws in the trial. As worldwide production of dextranomer products has been discontinued, except for dextranomer paste (which is currently only available in South Africa), the impact on clinical practice of these findings is extremely limited.</P>
<P>The enzymatic agent streptokinase/streptodornase demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in the time to a clean wound bed when compared with saline-soaked dressings. Poor handling and analysis of the data was a limitation of this trial and it should be noted that this enzyme is no longer available worldwide.</P>
<P>There is a complete absence of adequately powered, methodologically robust RCTs evaluating contemporary debridement interventions for surgical wounds. The trials included in this review investigate treatments that are no longer available and the trials were of poor quality. Trials reflecting the wider range of surgical, biosurgical, mechanical, chemical and autolytic debridement methods, and agents for surgical wounds were not identified.</P>

<P>Current innovations in wound debridement strategies increase the options available to the practitioner. Adequately powered, methodologically robust RCTs evaluating contemporary debridement interventions for surgical wounds are needed to guide clinical decision-making. Future trials should compare current debridement methods, for example surgical debridement compared to high-powered saline jet (at high pressure up to 15,000 pounds per square inch) or honey compared with low-cost established alternatives such as hydrogel dressings. These studies should: report time to healing as well as time to a clean wound bed; use valid measures of wound healing; assess quality of life; cost-effectiveness and be reported in accordance with CONSORT requirements.</P>

<P>Primary outcomes:</P>
<P>(1) Time to a clean wound bed - changes evaluated using specific variables; degree of erythema; degree of pus and debris; oedema; necrosis; granulation tissue. The results for each variable were assessed subjectively and presented individually</P>
<P>Degree of erythema (reported using a 0 to 3 degree table): no significant difference reported (2 wounds in group A and 2 in group B did not have any erythema and were excluded from the evaluation of this variable)</P>
<P>Oedema (reported using a 0 to 3 degree table): no significant difference (2 wounds in group A and 2 in group B did not have any oedema and were excluded from the evaluation)</P>
<P>Necrosis (reported as a percentage of the total area of the wound): no significant difference (4 wounds in group A and 10 in group B did not exhibit any necrotic material and were excluded from the evaluation)</P>
<P>Pus and debris (reported as a percentage of the total area of the wound): (1 wound in group B did not have any pus or debris and was excluded from the evaluation)</P>
<P>No significant difference between the days of treatment or cleaning of the wounds. However, the trial also reported a further division of group A and B for evaluation of this variable, but it was unclear as to when this division was made and the handling and reporting of the data was unclear, subjective and the groups were not comparable at baseline. So while the subgroup of group A showed a higher degree of improvement in the removal of pus and debris and this was reported as significant (P &lt; 0.05, Student's t-test) the poor handling and subjective nature of the data makes this outcome unreliable. The subgroup of group B did not demonstrate a significant difference</P>
<P>Granulation tissue:<BR/>Mean time to a clean wound bed (SD not reported):<BR/>(A) mean 6.5 days<BR/>(B) mean 5.2 days<BR/>No significant difference (1 wound in group A and 2 in Group B did not have any granulation tissue by the end of the trial and were excluded from the evaluation)</P>

<BR/>The search strategies for Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid EMBASE and EBSCO CINAHL can be found in <LINK REF="APP-02" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 2</LINK>, <LINK REF="APP-03" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 3</LINK> and <LINK REF="APP-04" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 4</LINK>, respectively. The MEDLINE search was combined with the Cochrane Highly Sensitive Search Strategy for identifying randomised trials in MEDLINE: sensitivity- and precision-maximizing version (2008 revision); Ovid format. The EMBASE and CINAHL searches were combined with the trial filters developed by the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network. No language restrictions were applied.<BR/>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">1.  Was the allocation sequence randomly generated?</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Low risk of bias</HEADING>
<P>The investigators describe a random component in the sequence generation process such as: referring to a random number table; using a computer random number generator; coin tossing; shuffling cards or envelopes; throwing dice; drawing of lots.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">High risk of bias</HEADING>
<P>The investigators describe a non-random component in the sequence generation process. Usually, the description would involve some systematic, non-random approach, for example: sequence generated by odd or even date of birth; sequence generated by some rule based on date (or day) of admission; sequence generated by some rule based on hospital or clinic record number.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Unclear</HEADING>
<P>Insufficient information about the sequence generation process to permit judgement of low or high risk of bias.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">2.  Was the treatment allocation adequately concealed?</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Low risk of bias</HEADING>
<P>Participants and investigators enrolling participants could not foresee assignment because one of the following, or an equivalent method, was used to conceal allocation: central allocation (including telephone, web-based and pharmacy-controlled randomisation); sequentially-numbered drug containers of identical appearance; sequentially-numbered, opaque, sealed envelopes.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">High risk of bias</HEADING>
<P>Participants or investigators enrolling participants could possibly foresee assignments and thus introduce selection bias, such as allocation based on: using an open random allocation schedule (e.g. a list of random numbers); assignment envelopes were used without appropriate safeguards (e.g. if envelopes were unsealed or non­ opaque or not sequentially numbered); alternation or rotation; date of birth; case record number; any other explicitly unconcealed procedure.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Unclear</HEADING>
<P>Insufficient information to permit judgement of low or high risk of bias. This is usually the case if the method of concealment is not described or not described in sufficient detail to allow a definite judgement, for example if the use of assignment envelopes is described, but it remains unclear whether envelopes were sequentially numbered, opaque and sealed.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">3.  Blinding - was knowledge of the allocated interventions adequately prevented during the study?</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Low risk of bias</HEADING>
<P>Any one of the following.</P>
<UL>
<LI>No blinding, but the review authors judge that the outcome and the outcome measurement are not likely to be influenced by lack of blinding.</LI>
<LI>Blinding of participants and key study personnel ensured, and unlikely that the blinding could have been broken.</LI>
<LI>Either participants or some key study personnel were not blinded, but outcome assessment was blinded and the non-blinding of others unlikely to introduce bias.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">High risk of bias</HEADING>
<P>Any one of the following.</P>
<UL>
<LI>No blinding or incomplete blinding, and the outcome or outcome measurement is likely to be influenced by lack of blinding.</LI>
<LI>Blinding of key study participants and personnel attempted, but likely that the blinding could have been broken.</LI>
<LI>Either participants or some key study personnel were not blinded, and the non-blinding of others likely to introduce bias.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Unclear</HEADING>
<P>Any one of the following.</P>
<UL>
<LI>Insufficient information to permit judgement of low or high risk of bias.</LI>
<LI>The study did not address this outcome.</LI>

</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">4.  Were incomplete outcome data adequately addressed?</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Low risk of bias</HEADING>
<P>Any one of the following.</P>
<UL>
<LI>No missing outcome data.</LI>
<LI>Reasons for missing outcome data unlikely to be related to true outcome (for survival data, censoring unlikely to be introducing bias).</LI>
<LI>Missing outcome data balanced in numbers across intervention groups, with similar reasons for missing data across groups.</LI>
<LI>For dichotomous outcome data, the proportion of missing outcomes compared with observed event risk not enough to have a clinically relevant impact on the intervention effect estimate.</LI>
<LI>For continuous outcome data, plausible effect size (difference in means or standardised difference in means) among missing outcomes not enough to have a clinically relevant impact on observed effect size.</LI>
<LI>Missing data have been imputed using appropriate methods.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">High risk of bias</HEADING>
<P>Any one of the following.</P>
<UL>
<LI>Reason for missing outcome data likely to be related to true outcome, with either imbalance in numbers or reasons for missing data across intervention groups.</LI>
<LI>For dichotomous outcome data, the proportion of missing outcomes compared with observed event risk enough to induce clinically relevant bias in intervention effect estimate.</LI>
<LI>For continuous outcome data, plausible effect size (difference in means or standardized difference in means) among missing outcomes enough to induce clinically relevant bias in observed effect size.</LI>
<LI>&#8216;As-treated&#8217; analysis done with substantial departure of the intervention received from that assigned at randomisation.</LI>
<LI>Potentially inappropriate application of simple imputation.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Unclear</HEADING>
<P>Any one of the following.</P>
<UL>
<LI>Insufficient reporting of attrition/exclusions to permit judgement of low or high risk of bias (e.g. number randomized not stated, no reasons for missing data provided).</LI>
<LI>The study did not address this outcome.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">5.  Are reports of the study free of suggestion of selective outcome reporting?</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Low risk of bias</HEADING>
<P>Any of the following.</P>
<UL>
<LI>The study protocol is available and all of the study&#8217;s pre-specified (primary and secondary) outcomes that are of interest in the review have been reported in the pre-specified way.</LI>
<LI>The study protocol is not available but it is clear that the published reports include all expected outcomes, including those that were pre-specified (convincing text of this nature may be uncommon)</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">High risk of bias</HEADING>
<P>Any one of the following.</P>
<UL>
<LI>Not all of the study&#8217;s pre-specified primary outcomes have been reported.</LI>
<LI>One or more primary outcomes is reported using measurements, analysis methods or subsets of the data (e.g. subscales) that were not pre-specified.</LI>
<LI>One or more reported primary outcomes were not pre-specified (unless clear justification for their reporting is provided, such as an unexpected adverse effect).</LI>
<LI>One or more outcomes of interest in the review are reported incompletely so that they cannot be entered in a meta-analysis.</LI>
<LI>The study report fails to include results for a key outcome that would be expected to have been reported for such a study.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Unclear</HEADING>
<P>Insufficient information to permit judgement of low or high risk of bias. It is likely that the majority of studies will fall into this category.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">6.  Other sources of potential bias:</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Low risk of bias</HEADING>
<P>The study appears to be free of other sources of bias.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">High risk of bias</HEADING>
<P>There is at least one important risk of bias. For example, the study:</P>
<UL>
<LI>had a potential source of bias related to the specific study design used; or</LI>
<LI>had extreme baseline imbalance; or</LI>
<LI>has been claimed to have been fraudulent; or</LI>
<LI>had some other problem.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Unclear</HEADING>
<P>There may be a risk of bias, but there is either:</P>
<UL>
<LI>insufficient information to assess whether an important risk of bias exists; or</LI>
<LI>insufficient rationale or evidence that an identified problem will introduce bias.</LI>
