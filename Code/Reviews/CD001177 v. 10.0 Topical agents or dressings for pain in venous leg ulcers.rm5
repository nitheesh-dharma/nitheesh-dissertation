<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2012-05-29 15:54:44 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Venous leg ulcers are often painful, both during and between dressing changes, and during surgical removal of dead tissue (debridement). Dressings, topical creams and lotions have been promoted to reduce the pain of ulcers. Two trials tested a dressing containing ibuprofen, however, the pain measures and time frames reported were different. One trial indicated that pain relief achieved over 5 days with ibuprofen dressings could represent a clinically relevant reduction in pain. The other trial found no significant difference in the chance of pain relief, measured on the first night of treatment, for ibuprofen dressings compared with foam dressings. This trial, however, was small and participants were only followed for a few weeks, which may not be long enough to assess whether the dressing affects healing. There was evidence from five trials that a local anaesthetic cream (EMLA 5%) reduces the post-procedural pain of debriding leg ulcers but there was insufficient evidence regarding any side effects of this cream and its impact on healing.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-08-02 10:31:39 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Six trials (343 participants) evaluated Eutectic Mixture of Local Anaesthetics (EMLA): lidocaine-prilocaine cream for the pain associated with ulcer debridement. The between-group difference in pain measured on a 100 mm scale was statistically significant in favour of EMLA (MD -20.65, 95% CI -12.19 to -29.11). No significant between-group differences in burning or itching were observed.</P>
<P>Two trials (470 participants with venous leg ulcers) evaluated ibuprofen slow-release foam dressings for persistent venous leg ulcer pain. Compared with local best practice, significantly more participants in the ibuprofen dressing group achieved the outcome of &gt;50% of the total maximum pain relief score between day 1 and day 5 than participants in the local best practice group (RR 1.63, 95% CI 1.24 to 2.15). The number needed to treat was 6 (95% CI 4 to 12). In the second trial, compared with an identical non-ibuprofen foam dressing, there was no statistically significant difference in the proportion of participants experiencing slight to complete pain relief on the first evening of treatment.Limited data were available to assess healing rates or adverse events.</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2012-08-02 10:13:38 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is some evidence to suggest that ibuprofen dressings may offer pain relief to people with painful venous leg ulcers. EMLA (5%) appears to provide effective pain relief during the debridement of venous leg ulcers. Further research should consider standardised pain assessment methods and assess both the effect on ulcer healing and the impact of long term use of these treatments.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2012-08-02 10:13:42 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2012-06-06 09:54:42 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Leg ulceration is estimated to have a point prevalence in Europe and Australia of 0.1% to 0.2% of the adult population (<LINK REF="REF-Callam-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Callam 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Graham-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Graham 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Brien-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Brien 2000</LINK>). Prevalence increases with age, and the condition is a chronic recurring problem with people experiencing episodes of open leg ulceration lasting from a few weeks to 50 years (<LINK REF="REF-Callam-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Callam 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Noonan-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Noonan 1998</LINK>). Given this pattern of ulceration, healing and recurrence, it has been estimated that up to 1% of the population will be affected by leg ulceration at some point. The majority of leg ulcers are caused by (are secondary to) venous disease, other causes include arterial disease, vasculitis and diabetes.</P>
<P>Pain is a frequently reported feature of venous leg ulceration (<LINK REF="REF-Hamer-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hamer 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hofman-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hofman 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hyland-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hyland 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lindholm-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lindholm 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nelzen-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nelzen 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Noonan-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Noonan 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Phillips-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Phillips 1994</LINK>). The precise prevalence of pain is difficult to determine due to methodological differences between the trials and the use of predominantly hospital populations. Reported figures for people experiencing severe or continuous pain associated with a leg ulcer range from 17% to 65% (<LINK REF="REF-Franks-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Franks 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hofman-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hofman 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hyland-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hyland 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nelzen-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nelzen 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Phillips-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Phillips 1994</LINK>). It is accepted that when pain is a feature it has a major impact on both sufferers' and carers' quality of life, with sufferers stating that the worst aspect of having a leg ulcer is the pain (<LINK REF="REF-Briggs-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Briggs 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Chase-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chase 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Douglas-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Douglas 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ebbeskog-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ebbeskog 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hyde-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hyde 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lindholm-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lindholm 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Phillips-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Phillips 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Walshe-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walshe 1995</LINK>).</P>
<P>The cause of pain in people with venous leg ulcers is complex and often poorly defined. The pathologies associated with leg ulceration (e.g. rheumatoid arthritis, vascular disease and diabetes) cause pain with or without an ulcer present (<LINK REF="REF-Gibson-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gibson 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Noonan-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Noonan 1998</LINK>). The presence of an ulcer can cause additional pain through two mechanisms. Firstly, pain is produced by the patient's normal response to wounding (i.e. through the inflammatory process associated with injury), and secondly, pain is produced by damaged nerves. Leg ulceration may damage peripheral nerves by a variety of processes, such ischaemia (lack of oxygen), infection and inflammation and this may cause a disruption in the way the nerves respond to stimuli. This disruption can lead to a neuropathic component to the pain, where sensitised nerves produce an exaggerated response to touch, i.e. a slightly painful stimulus may be felt as extreme pain (<LINK REF="REF-Briggs-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Briggs 2007</LINK>). Furthermore, pain is a symptom of wound complications such as infection, skin maceration and contact dermatitis, which may contribute to the overall leg ulcer pain. In addition, leg ulcer treatments such as replacing dressings, removing dead tissue (debridement) and firm bandages may cause pain. In a recent international survey where practitioners from 11 European countries were questioned, leg ulceration was perceived to be more painful than other chronic wounds. The practitioners surveyed indicated that pain at dressing changes was common and was caused by dressing adherence and wound cleansing (<LINK REF="REF-Moffatt-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moffatt 2002</LINK>). It is clear from this that dressing choice and method of removal have an effect on venous leg ulcer pain, and there are a number of trials where pain scores are reported as one of the characteristics of dressing performance (<LINK REF="STD-Ohlsson-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Ohlsson 1994</LINK>).</P>
<P>Another leg ulcer treatment is sharp debridement of slough and necrotic tissue. This is advocated by some clinicians as the fastest way of achieving a clean ulcer, which, in turn, is thought to improve healing. It is thought that debridement reduces odour, lowers the risk of infection and improves the results of skin grafting (<LINK REF="REF-Vanscheidt-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vanscheidt 2001</LINK>). Debridement, however, is not without risks. It is an extremely painful procedure (<LINK REF="STD-Hansson-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Hansson 1993</LINK>), and people with ulcers often ask clinicians to stop before the debridement is complete because they are unable to tolerate the pain (<LINK REF="STD-Enander-Malmros-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Enander Malmros 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lok-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Lok 1999</LINK>). In addition, sharp debridement may delay wound healing, as there is a risk of damaging healthy tissue and underlying blood vessels (<LINK REF="REF-Vanscheidt-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vanscheidt 2001</LINK>), and, as yet, there is no direct evidence that debridement decreases the time taken for a wound to heal <LINK REF="REF-Bradley-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bradley 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>Non-systematic literature reviews and case trial reports have advocated the use of occlusive dressings, such as semipermeable films and hydrocolloids, as a method of pain relief (<LINK REF="REF-Hermans-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hermans 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kannon-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kannon 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Seeley-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Seeley 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Thomas-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thomas 1989</LINK>). There a number of postulated theories that attempt to explain how an inert dressing can provide pain relief. In a review of possible mechanisms, <LINK REF="REF-Richardson-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Richardson 2010</LINK> suggests that there could be as many as 10 discrete but interrelated mechanisms of action to explain pain relieving dressings. The authors suggest that it is possible that the pain relief associated with the application of a new dressing to a chronic wound could be due to both physiological and psychological factors, as opposed to the analgesic effect of the dressing alone.<BR/>

<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2012-06-06 09:57:02 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Topical (external, surface) treatments such as the local anaesthetic EMLA cream (Eutectic Mixture of Local Anaesthetics: lidocaine-prilocaine cream) and analgesics have been applied directly into ulcers in an attempt to relieve pain (e.g. <LINK REF="STD-Agrifoglio-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Agrifoglio 2000</LINK>). The discovery of opiate receptors on peripheral nerve terminals has also lead to the topical use of morphine in wounds (using hydrogel as a carrier) (<LINK REF="REF-Stein-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stein 1995</LINK>), and a number of trials have reported the analgesic effect of morphine when applied topically to painful wounds (<LINK REF="STD-Back-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Back 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Flock-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Flock 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Twillman-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Twillman 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zeppetella-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zeppetella 2004</LINK>). This is thought to work via local action on opioid receptors (<LINK REF="REF-Stein-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stein 1995</LINK>). This hypothesis was tested in the <LINK REF="REF-Ribeiro-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ribeiro 2004</LINK> trial, which studied the bioavailability of topically-applied morphine to six participants with cutaneous ulcers in a hospice setting. In five participants there was no evidence that the topical morphine had been systemically absorbed (i.e. into the body), which supports the view that the action is local. However, morphine metabolites were detected in one participant who had a large pressure sore, suggesting that morphine can be absorbed systemically via a wound with a large surface area. This underlines the importance of research designed to test the safety and efficacy of all topical agents in chronic wounds.<BR/>

<P>We considered trials that recruited people of any age, in any care setting who were described as having venous leg ulcers. As the diagnosis of venous leg ulceration varied between trials, a standard definition of a venous leg ulcer was difficult to apply. Trials that included people with leg ulcers, where the ulceration was reported to be due to venous disease, were included irrespective of the method of diagnosis used. People with arterial, diabetic, and neuropathic ulcers were excluded, as it is unclear whether the nature of their pain is similar to that of venous leg ulceration. People with ulcers reported to be due to sickle cell disease or rheumatoid arthritis were also excluded, as the ulcer aetiology (cause) and systemic disease processes involved in these conditions may mean that the mechanisms and treatment of pain may differ from people with pain from venous leg ulceration.</P>
<P>Trials that included a mixture of people with the following ulcer aetiologies: arterial disease; mixed aetiology; neuropathic; and diabetes were included, if the outcomes for people with venous ulcers were reported separately, or the original data were available.</P>

<P>For this third update, each included trial was appraised according to the risk of bias assessment criteria described in the Cochrane Handbook (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). Each validity item was assessed separately; ratings for each item were not combined into an overall score. Each included trial was assessed by one author (MMSJ) and checked by a second (MB). All disagreements were resolved by discussion. The following criteria were applied:</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">1. Random sequence generation (selection bias)</HEADING>
<P>Low risk of bias: adequate sequence generation was reported using random number tables, computer random number generator, coin tossing, or card/envelope shuffling.<BR/>High risk of bias: used a system involving dates, names, or admittance numbers for the allocation of participants. Such trials were considered as quasi-randomised and were excluded from the review.<BR/>Unclear risk of bias: did not describe one of the adequate methods, but mentioned randomisation.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">2. Allocation concealment (selection bias)</HEADING>
<P>Low risk of bias: a randomisation method was described that would not allow an investigator/participant to know or influence allocation to an intervention group before an eligible participant entered the trial, such as central randomisation or serially-numbered, sealed envelopes.<BR/>High risk of bias: an inadequate method of allocation was used, such as alternate medical record numbers or unsealed envelopes; or there was information in the trial report indicating that investigators or participants could have influenced group allocation.<BR/>Unclear risk of bias: the trial report mentioned randomisation but there was no information about the method used for allocation of participants to treatment groups, or a method was reported that was not clearly adequate.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">3. Blinding of participants and personnel (performance bias)</HEADING>
<P>This item was graded as &#8216;Low risk of bias&#8217; for blinding participants, &#8216;Unclear risk of bias&#8217; if the relevant information was not stated in the trial report and &#8216;High risk of bias&#8217; for unblinded participants.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">4. Blinding of outcome assessment (detection bias)</HEADING>
<P>This item was graded as &#8216;Low risk of bias&#8217; for blinded outcome assessment, &#8216;Unclear risk of bias&#8217; if the relevant information was not stated in the trial report and &#8216;High risk of bias&#8217; for unblinded outcome assessment.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">5. Incomplete outcome data (attrition bias)</HEADING>
<P>Low risk of bias: trial report included information on participant withdrawals and indicates that all participants randomised were included in the final analysis as either all participants completed the trial, or participants that did not complete the trial were accommodated in an intention-to-treat (ITT analysis).<BR/>High risk of bias: final analysis was based on only those participants who completed the trial, and did not included all participants randomised.<BR/>Unclear risk of bias: unable to determine whether participants included in final analysis were all participants initially randomised.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">6. Selective reporting (reporting bias)</HEADING>
<P>Low risk of bias: either the trial protocol was available and all of the trial&#8217;s pre-specified outcomes were reported, or the trial report described evaluation of expected outcomes and presented results.<BR/>High risk: the trial report did not include results for a key outcome that would have been expected to be reported.<BR/>Unclear risk: insufficient information in the trial report to permit judgement of low or high risk of bias.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">7. Other sources of bias</HEADING>
<P>Low risk of bias: the trial appeared to be free of other sources of bias.<BR/>High risk of bias: there was a potential source of bias related to the trial design (e.g., stopping early), or the trial has been claimed to have been fraudulent, or had some other problem.<BR/>Unclear risk of bias: insufficient information to permit judgement of low or high risk of bias.</P>

<EFFECT_MEASURES MODIFIED="2012-06-06 10:33:30 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We have grouped results according to the type of treatment for pain relief (topical agents or dressings). We have undertaken statistical pooling of outcome data on groups of trials considered to be sufficiently similar in terms of trial design and characteristics of participants, interventions and outcomes. We have reported estimates for dichotomous outcomes (e.g. between-group differences in the proportions of participants experiencing pain relief) as a risk ratio (RR) with associated 95% confidence intervals (CI). We have reported estimates for continuous data outcomes (e.g. between-group differences in the change in pain score on a visual analogue scale) as a mean difference (MD) with 95% CI. </P>

<HETEROGENEITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2012-06-06 10:03:24 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The presence of clinical heterogeneity was assessed by comparing the trials in terms of characteristics of co-interventions, setting and population.  We assessed the extent of statistical heterogeneity by using the I-squared statistic (I²) (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2003</LINK>). This describes the percentage of the variability in effect estimates that is due to heterogeneity rather than sampling error (chance).  We considered values greater than 50% as being indicative of substantial heterogeneity, in which case a random-effects model was used to pool the results from different trials, otherwise a fixed-effect model was used. </P>

If the event rates were less than 30%, dichotomous outcomes for each trial were summarised as odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals (CI); if event rates exceeded 30% then risk ratio (RR) was used (<LINK REF="REF-Deeks-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deeks 1998</LINK>). Where continuous outcomes were measured in the same way across trials, we estimate a mean difference (MD) with 95% CI. We planned to present a standardised mean difference (SMD) where trials measured the same outcome using different methods. Where trials reported adverse events in sufficient detail (e.g. the number of participants who experienced at least one adverse event) or proportions of ulcers healed following treatment, we analysed these data as dichotomous. Results were pooled where a number of trials made the same comparisons and reported the same outcome in similar participants, otherwise, a narrative review was undertaken.</P>

<P>One RCT was identified at the last review update which attempted to address the question of efficacy of topical morphine on chronic skin ulcers (<LINK REF="STD-Vernassiere-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Vernassiere 2005</LINK>). The trial included people with leg ulcers and pressure ulcers and the authors were contacted during the last update to request data for only those people with leg ulcers alone when the trial was awaiting assessment. We repeated this request to the contact author for this update and did not receive a reply so have excluded it from this update.</P>

This was a conference abstract, and the trial authors were contacted with a request for further information.

<P>Two trials, reported in abstract form only, that evaluated hydrocolloid dressings, were identified at the last update (Bruckner 2009; <LINK REF="STD-Meaume-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Meaume 2008</LINK>). Both trial authors were contacted during the last update to request further information. For this update, we identified a full trial report (<LINK REF="STD-Bruckner-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Bruckner 2010</LINK>) for the Bruckner 2009 abstract and were able to conclude from the full report that the dressing was not used primarily to relieve pain. A further request for information regarding the other conference abstract (<LINK REF="STD-Meaume-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Meaume 2008</LINK>) was made (email communication), but we were still unable to confirm eligibility for inclusion in this review.

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">EMLA for debridement pain</HEADING>
<P>Six trials involving 343 participants with venous leg ulcers compared EMLA cream with placebo cream or no anaesthetic for the treatment of pain caused by leg ulcer debridement (<LINK REF="STD-Agrifoglio-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Agrifoglio 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hansson-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Hansson 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Holm-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Holm 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Johnson-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Johnson 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lok-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Lok 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rosenthal-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Rosenthal 2001</LINK>). Five of the trials reported a statistically significant reduction in the pain outcome measured when EMLA (5%) was applied topically for 30 to 45 minutes under occlusion prior to debridement (<LINK REF="STD-Agrifoglio-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Agrifoglio 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hansson-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Hansson 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Holm-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Holm 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lok-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Lok 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rosenthal-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Rosenthal 2001</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Johnson-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Johnson 1992</LINK> reported no statistically significant between-group difference.</P>
<P>The characteristics of the trials are summarised in <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>. Methodologically the trials were considered similar. All six trials measured pain as the primary outcome using a 100 mm VAS. All the trials recruited people with venous leg ulcers of less than 50 cm² area from dermatology and vascular centres.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Outcome 1: pain score at debridement</HEADING>
<P>The six trials were considered sufficiently similar to pool. The observed I² was 53%. Meta-analysis (random-effects) demonstrated that there was a statistically significant reduction in pain scores measured on a VAS 0-100 mm at debridement associated with EMLA cream (MD -20.65, 95% CI -29.11 to -12.19; P value &lt; 0.00001) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>). This represents a clinically significant reduction in pain associated with EMLA.</P>
<P>The trials were explored to see what factors could have contributed to the statistical heterogeneity. Three trials included people with diabetes (<LINK REF="STD-Hansson-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Hansson 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Holm-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Holm 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lok-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Lok 1999</LINK>), whilst three excluded people with diabetes on the basis that diabetic neuropathy (which is frequently associated with reduced sensory perception) might confound the result (<LINK REF="STD-Agrifoglio-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Agrifoglio 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Johnson-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Johnson 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rosenthal-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Rosenthal 2001</LINK>). Two trials restricted their sample to people who had previously experienced pain at debridement (<LINK REF="STD-Johnson-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Johnson 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rosenthal-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Rosenthal 2001</LINK>), whereas the other trials included all people with venous leg ulcers.</P>
<P>One trial administered the VAS during the debridement procedure (<LINK REF="STD-Holm-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Holm 1990</LINK>), whilst in the remainder the VAS was administered after the procedure.  Excluding this trial from the analysis reduced both the observed between-trial heterogeneity (I² = 29%) and the overall effect estimate (MD (fixed-effect) -18.72, 95% CI -24.41 to -13.02; P value &lt; 0.00001).</P>
<P>One trial reported that participants were given oral analgesia in addition to the EMLA cream (<LINK REF="STD-Lok-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Lok 1999</LINK>).  Excluding this trial from the analysis did not reduce the observed heterogeneity (I² = 63%; MD -21.87 (random-effects), 95% CI -32.01 to -11.73; P value &lt; 0.0001).  None of the other trials recorded oral analgesic intake and therefore the impact of this is uncertain.</P>
<P>The <LINK REF="STD-Johnson-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Johnson 1992</LINK> trial may also account for some of the heterogeneity, because the cleansing did not only include sharp debridement, which is very painful, but also included rubbing the wound with gauze and irrigating the wound which are likely to be less painful procedures. Excluding this trial from the analysis reduced the observed heterogeneity (I² = 18%) and increased the overall effect estimate (MD (fixed-effect) -23.38, 95% CI -29.43 to -17.14; P value &lt; 0.00001).</P>
<P>The meta-analysis of the six trials suggests improved pain relief when EMLA is used, but the results should be viewed with caution, given the observed heterogeneity.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Outcome 2: ulcer healing</HEADING>
<P>Only one trial reported healing outcomes. This trial favoured placebo in terms of the number of ulcers healed at the end of the trial; 1/22 healed in the EMLA group compared with 5/21 in the control group, although this is not a statistically significant difference (OR for healing with control 6.56, 95% CI 0.70 to 61.85) (<LINK REF="STD-Hansson-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Hansson 1993</LINK>) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>). The interpretation of this finding is not straightforward, however, since the groups were not matched for baseline ulcer duration (EMLA: median 9.5 months (range, 1-168); Control: 5 months (range, 1-504)). Findings from prognostic trials have suggested that the two most important predictors of delayed healing in participants with venous leg ulceration are baseline ulcer duration and wound surface area; people with larger and more chronic wounds are more likely to experience longer times to healing (<LINK REF="REF-Margolis-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Margolis 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Margolis-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Margolis 2004</LINK>). The period between individual debridement sessions ranged from two to nine days and the follow-up time varied considerably for each participant (one participant visited the clinic once a month with a follow-up time of 140 days. The range for the EMLA group was 38 to 40 days). Since the follow-up time varied considerably for each participant, the comparison of the healing outcomes may not be valid. The trial was also potentially underpowered to detect healing since only six events occurred.</P>
<P>No other included trial examined healing as an outcome and, therefore, the impact of the local anaesthetic on healing cannot be judged.</P>

There was no statistically significant difference between rates of adverse events for EMLA and placebo creams (OR for burning with EMLA 1.72, 95% CI 0.74 to 4.01, <LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>; OR for itching with EMLA 1.68 95%CI 0.64 to 4.38, <LINK REF="CMP-001.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.4</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Outcome 1: pain relief/pain scores</HEADING>
<P>We consulted members of the Cochrane Pain, Palliative &amp; Supportive Care Review Group with a view to pooling the data from two trials evaluating ibuprofen-containing dressings (<LINK REF="STD-Arapoglou-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Arapoglou 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gottrup-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Gottrup 2008</LINK>), however, it was agreed that the pain measures and time frames reported were too heterogeneous for the data to be pooled. Therefore, where the between-group difference was statistically significant, we have estimated a NNT (number needed to treat) with 95% CI. The NNT estimates the number of people who would need to use the topical ibuprofen dressing for one person to achieve significant pain relief.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Gottrup-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Gottrup 2008</LINK> observed that on the first evening of treatment, 46 participants out of 62 (74%) achieved some pain relief with the ibuprofen-containing foam compared with 35/60 (58%) with the plain foam. The between-group difference was not statistically significant although the comparison is underpowered (RR 1.27, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.65; p=0.07) (<LINK REF="CMP-002.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.1</LINK>). </P>
<P>In the <LINK REF="STD-Gottrup-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Gottrup 2008</LINK> trial, the average pain scores reported indicated a reduction of 2.7 in the ibuprofen foam group (from 6.8 to 4.1) compared with 2.0 in the foam dressing group (6.6 to 4.6) (no variance data reported). This represents an overall percentage pain reduction of 40% and 30%, respectively, from baseline pain scores (i.e. a difference of 10% between the groups). A mean between-group difference with 95% CI could not be estimated for this review.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Arapoglou-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Arapoglou 2011</LINK>
</P>
<P>The proportion of patients with a summed pain relief score of more than 50% of the total maximum pain relief score from day 1 to day 5 was reported (TOTPAR<SUB>D5&gt;50%</SUB>). The authors reported that 49% of participants achieved more than 50% pain relief in the ibuprofen-containing dressing group compared to 30% in the comparator foam dressing group. The between-group difference was statistically significant in favour of the ibuprofen-containing dressing (RR 1.63, 95% CI 1.24 to 2.15; p=0.0006) (<LINK REF="CMP-003.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.1</LINK>).</P>
<P>We estimated a NNT of 6 (95% CI 4 to 12). This can be interpreted as 19% more participants experienced greater than 50% pain relief in the ibuprofen-containing dressing group compared to the placebo group. This could represent a clinically relevant reduction in pain, especially if combined with other methods of pain relief (<LINK REF="REF-Dworkin-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dworkin 2008</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Outcome 2: ulcer healing</HEADING>
<P>Gottrup reported similar rates of complete ulcer healing in the two groups after six weeks: 16% (10/62) with ibuprofen foam and 15% (9/60) with standard foam (<LINK REF="STD-Gottrup-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Gottrup 2008</LINK>). The between-group difference was not statistically significant (OR 0.85, 95% CI 0.32 to 2.26) (<LINK REF="CMP-002.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.2</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Arapoglou-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Arapoglou 2011</LINK> did not report ulcer healing.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Outcome 3: adverse effects</HEADING>
<P>Gottrup reported that 12 participants experienced 21 adverse events in the ibuprofen foam group while in the comparator group there were 10 adverse events in seven participants (<LINK REF="STD-Gottrup-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Gottrup 2008</LINK>). There were no serious dressing-related events in the trial. The between-group difference in the proportion of participants experiencing adverse events was not statistically significant (OR 1.46, 95% CI 0.52 to 4.11) (<LINK REF="CMP-002.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.3</LINK>). In the ibuprofen group there was local infection in three participants, eczema in two participants, blisters in two participants, urticaria in one patient, pain in one ulcer and 12 other participants had 13 incidences said to be unrelated to the dressing. In the standard foam group there were local wound infections in two participants, bullae in one patient, eczema in two participants, blisters in one patient, and another four participants had six events reported to be unrelated to the dressing. <LINK REF="STD-Arapoglou-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Arapoglou 2011</LINK> did not report adverse events.<BR/>

<P>Two trials that evaluated low-dose ibuprofen releasing foam dressings reported this outcome. Both trials reported that the between-group difference in pain relief assessment scores was statistically significant. However, variance data for the differences were not presented. 'Pain relief achieved' was assessed in different ways across these trials; as pain scores on a visual analogue scale (11 points: 0 to 10), and as total pain relief achieved (TOTPAR<SUB>D5&lt;50%</SUB>). These differences in the way pain relief was assessed, coupled with the unavailability of variance data, limited any assessment of between-group differences in persistent pain across these trials for this review.</P>
<P>One trial indicated that there is a statistically significant between-group difference in favour of ibuprofen-containing dressings for TOTPAR<SUB>D5&lt;50%</SUB> (<LINK REF="STD-Arapoglou-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Arapoglou 2011</LINK>). However, this trial was considered to be at a high risk of performance and detection bias as it was described as an open study design. As the primary outcome for this review, pain, whichever way it is measured, may be subject to observer or measurement bias, this should be taken into consideration when considering the pain outcomes reported by this trial. Both trials that evaluated low-dose ibuprofen releasing foam dressings were considered at unclear risk of bias for allocation concealment, as the method of treatment group allocation was not reported. </P>
<P>Both trials were of relatively short duration (only a few weeks long), and undertaken in people with chronic wounds where the dressing application was for the treatment of pain. One of the trials excluded participants who "had painful ulcers that had been resistant to analgesic treatment over the last six months" (<LINK REF="STD-Gottrup-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Gottrup 2008</LINK>). For this trial we were able to estimate the between-group difference in the proportion of participants who achieved some pain relieve on the first evening of treatment, which was not statistically significant. This trial also reported the proportion of ulcers healed at follow-up. The between-group difference was not statistically significant.</P>
<P>Ibuprofen is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). Systemic NSAIDs are associated with a number of important adverse effects including: effects on the kidneys, exacerbation of asthma in susceptible people, and problems in the gastrointestinal tract including ulceration (<LINK REF="REF-Bandolier-Extra-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bandolier Extra 2005</LINK>). Topical NSAIDs can be given in lower doses, and their adverse event profile is better (<LINK REF="REF-Bandolier-Extra-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bandolier Extra 2005</LINK>). This observation, however, is based on studies amongst people predominantly with arthritic pain, where topical NSAIDs are massaged into intact skin. Only one of the include trials in the present review that evaluated a topical NSAID reported on adverse events (<LINK REF="STD-Gottrup-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Gottrup 2008</LINK>), concluding that because there were few dressing-related events reported during the trial, that this indicated good dressing safety.</P>
<P>The variability in the pain assessment method and the reporting of pain outcomes across trials, coupled with the potential bias associated with un-blinded outcome assessment, makes interpretation of the current evidence-base for topical NSAIDs in the management of chronically painful leg ulcers difficult. We would recommend that future trials of topical NSAIDs for this condition need to consider a standardised pain assessment method to facilitate interpretation of results across trials, be of longer duration and be better reported, in order to assess both the efficacy for pain management and the safety and tolerability along with their effect on ulcer healing.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Treatment-related pain</HEADING>
<P>Six trials focused on the relief of one aspect of pain, namely pain associated with leg ulcer debridement. These trials all evaluated EMLA cream versus placebo for the sharp debridement of venous leg ulcers. The rationale for the proliferation of research effort in this area appears to be based on two factors. Firstly, that debridement is a painful procedure (<LINK REF="STD-Hansson-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Hansson 1993</LINK>), with participants often asking clinicians to stop before it is complete as they are unable to tolerate the pain (<LINK REF="STD-Lok-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Lok 1999</LINK>), and, secondly, the belief that the removal of necrotic and devitalised tissue improves the healing potential of a leg ulcer (<LINK REF="STD-Hansson-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Hansson 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Holm-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Holm 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lok-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Lok 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>The pooled effect across the six trials for the mean between-group difference in the VAS score at debridement was statistically significant in favour of EMLA. The largest between-group effect estimate in favour of EMLA that was observed was for one trial that assessed pain during the ulcer debridement procedure (<LINK REF="STD-Holm-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Holm 1990</LINK>). This may in part be due to the specific effect of EMLA on the procedural pain associated with debridement, as opposed to the chronic, background pain that is associated with venous leg ulcers. The remaining five trials all assessed pain after debridement. The between-trial heterogeneity that was observed for this comparison was reduced in the sensitivity analyses excluding the trial where pain was assessed during debridement (<LINK REF="STD-Holm-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Holm 1990</LINK>), and excluding one trial where the cleansing procedure included rubbing the wound (<LINK REF="STD-Johnson-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Johnson 1992</LINK>). The effect estimates remained statistically significant.</P>
<P>Sharp debridement is an aggressive treatment involving scalpel, scissors, a sharp curette and forceps. The removal of necrotic and sloughy material from a wound bed is proposed to reduce the risk of infection, reduce odour and promote granulation tissue, and is an accepted therapeutic activity in wound healing (<LINK REF="STD-Lok-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Lok 1999</LINK>). It has been suggested that sharp debridement is the quickest way to achieve a clean ulcer and that it improves the result of skin grafting and the healing potential of the ulcer (<LINK REF="REF-Vanscheidt-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vanscheidt 2001</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-Steed-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Steed 1996</LINK> reported the effect of extensive debridement on the healing of diabetic foot ulcers by pooling data from 10 treatment centres, reporting that those centres that performed more frequent debridement had better healing rates. The trial by <LINK REF="STD-Lok-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Lok 1999</LINK> included in this review reported that the mean ulcer size at follow-up was inversely proportional to the number of debridements undertaken during the trial.  However, the between-group difference in the proportion of ulcers healed at the end of treatment reported by another included trial (<LINK REF="STD-Hansson-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Hansson 1993</LINK>) was not statistically significant. Improved healing may be attributable to aspects of wound care other than debridement.</P>
<P>The pooled effect estimate from five trials included in this review indicates that people with venous leg ulcers could expect their post-debridement pain to be reduced by 19 mm on a 100 mm VAS if given EMLA. Evidence from one trial indicates that the procedural pain associated with ulcer debridement is also significantly reduced with EMLA. However, none of the included trials provided adequate detail in the trial report regarding the randomisation sequence generation or any concealment of allocation procedure and are therefore considered to be at an unclear risk of selection bias.  The results should therefore be interpreted with caution, given that there may be systematic differences in the characteristics of the participants receiving EMLA and those receiving placebo in these trials.  One of the trials (<LINK REF="STD-Hansson-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Hansson 1993</LINK>) was also considered to be at a high risk of performance and detection bias as it was described as an open trial.</P>
<P>The impact of local anaesthetics on ulcer healing was not sufficiently evaluated by the included trials in this review. A review of in vitro studies has suggested that local anaesthetics reduce granulocyte activity, inhibit fibroblast growth and collagen synthesis (<LINK REF="REF-Dahl-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dahl 1994</LINK>). A reduction in leukocyte activity in surgical wounds has also been reported (<LINK REF="REF-Eriksson-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eriksson 1992</LINK>). Conversely, no significant differences between EMLA and placebo on the healing of experimentally-generated burns at two weeks were evident from one within-subject study (<LINK REF="REF-Pedersen-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pedersen 1996</LINK>).The clinical implication of these experimental studies for the effects of EMLA on the healing of chronic wounds has yet to be determined through adequately designed randomised controlled trials.</P>
<P>There is still a paucity of evidence for the effects of topical agents or dressings for pain in venous leg ulcers from robust, adequately reported RCTs to inform this area of wound care practice. A possible reason could be that people with venous leg ulcers are not considered a sufficiently large, discrete group who have pain warranting study, unlike, for example, those with osteoarthritis, low back pain or postoperative pain. If a separate review was conducted exploring systemic analgesia or neuromodulation (e.g. Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (TENS)) the evidence base might be different. Pain specialists might not be aware of the need for robustly designed and clearly reported RCTs to evaluate the effects of topical agents and dressings for pain management and healing in people with venous leg ulcers. Similarly, wound care specialists may be aware of the need for well designed RCTs, but lack the specialist knowledge of pain management to develop and manage trials that evaluate analgesic interventions.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Limitations</HEADING>
<P>There are limitations to the findings from this review. In addition to the electronic searches of bibliographic databases, the search for evidence for this review included handsearching and contact with trialists. Although this search strategy was comprehensive, the presence of a publication bias may still be evident. All of the published trials in this review reported statistically significant differences. The unpublished trial found during searching reported no difference (<LINK REF="STD-Johnson-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Johnson 1992</LINK>). There may be other unpublished trials with similar results that we have been unable to identify.</P>

<P>On the basis of two trials, there is some evidence that foam dressings containing ibuprofen provide pain relief for some people with painful venous leg ulcers. The release of ibuprofen into the wound bed is dependent on the presence of wound exudate. This treatment would, therefore, not be an option for pain management for people with wounds that have low levels of, or no, exudate. Evidence from six trials indicates that EMLA (5%) significantly reduces pain during the debridement of venous leg ulcers compared with placebo or no anaesthetic. Existing trials examining EMLA versus placebo are designed to assess pain, but do not address the related question of whether debridement is necessary.</P>
<P>The decision to debride a venous leg ulcer needs to be made with knowledge of the evidence-base, clinical need and the risks associated. Severe pain is a clearly documented risk associated with debridement and EMLA 5% cream is the only topical anaesthetic for which this review has found evidence of analgesic efficacy. EMLA applied for 30 to 45 minutes in a dose of 1 g to 2 g/ 10 cm² significantly reduces the pain from sharp debridement and decreases the incidence of post-debridement pain. However, most trials to date have excluded people with ulcers greater than 50 cm². The analgesic efficacy of EMLA in people with larger ulcers is currently not known.</P>
<P>It should be noted that in certain countries, specifically the UK, EMLA is not licensed to be applied directly to wounds. It is believed that EMLA is currently approved as a topical anaesthetic for the debridement of leg ulcers in Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland (<LINK REF="REF-Blanke-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blanke 2003</LINK>).</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2012-05-29 16:22:16 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review highlights the need for further randomised controlled trials to examine the effectiveness of local interventions to relieve the underlying pain of venous leg ulceration in long-term follow-up studies. Further research is required to determine whether dressings that incorporate ibuprofen reduce pain significantly. Further trials are also warranted to assess methods of pain relief during the actual debridement procedure and that evaluate EMLA in people with venous leg ulcers greater than 50 cm<SUP>2</SUP>. Participants should be followed-up for sufficient time to assess healing and to measure the incidence of adverse effects. Further research is also required to determine whether debridement of venous leg ulcers aids healing.</P>
<P>The methodologies developed to assess interventions in the management of other chronic pain syndromes could be adapted to address questions related to leg ulcers (<LINK REF="REF-McQuay-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">McQuay 1997</LINK>). Specific outcome measures need to be developed for this group of people. In the absence of such measures, trials should follow the guidance outlined in the IMMPACT (Initiative on methods, measurement and pain assessment in clinical trials) recommendations. IMMPACT recommends four core chronic pain outcomes of which at least two should be measured in a trial (<LINK REF="REF-Dworkin-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dworkin 2008</LINK>). These are:</P>
<OL>
<LI>Intensity of pain over time, assessed by a numerical rating scale.</LI>
<LI>Impact of physical functioning assessed by the multi-dimensional pain inventory, or the brief pain inventory.</LI>
<LI>Peoples' overall assessment of improvement assessed by the Patient Global Impression of Change scale.</LI>
<LI>Emotional functioning assessed by the Beck depression inventory and the profile of mood states.</LI>
</OL>
<P>In addition from a wound management perspective:</P>
<OL>
<LI>Time to complete healing.</LI>
<LI>Adverse effects.</LI>
</OL>
<P>Baseline comparability using the following criteria would also be desirable:</P>
<OL>
<LI>Baseline pain scores.</LI>
<LI>Psychological measures (anxiety, mood, depression).</LI>
<LI>Analgesic consumption.</LI>
</OL>
<P>Further trials should adopt a best practice methodology, use consistent outcomes and be better reported in line with the CONSORT (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials) guidelines for the reporting of RCTs (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 2010</LINK>).</P>
