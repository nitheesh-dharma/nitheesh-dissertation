<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2009-08-10 08:56:00 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Sonja L  Henderson">
<P>Chlamydia is a sexually transmitted infection which, if a mother has it during pregnancy and labour, can cause eye or lung infections in the newborn baby. The risk of transmission during birth varies, but is about 20% to 50% for eye infections and about 10% to 20% for infection of the lungs. Mothers may also be at increased risk of infection of the uterus. The review looked at various antibiotics being used during pregnancy to reduce these problems and to assess any adverse effects. Tetracyclines taken in pregnancy are known to be associated with teeth and bone abnormalities in babies, and some women find erythromycin unpleasant to take because of feeling sick and vomiting. The review found eleven trials, involving 1449 women, on erythromycin, amoxycillin, azithromycin and clindamycin, and the overall trial quality was good. However, all the trials assessed 'microbiological cure' (that is they looked for an eradication of the infection) and none assessed whether the eye or lung problems for the baby were reduced. Also, none of the trials were large enough to assess potential adverse outcomes adequately. The review found amoxycillin was an effective alternative to erythromycin but lack of long-term assessment of outcomes caused concern about its routine use in practice. If erythromycin is used, some women may stop taking it because of adverse effects. Azithromycin and clindamycin are potential alternatives. More research is needed.</P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2012-01-03 12:35:31 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Sonja L  Henderson">
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Chlamydia trachomatis is a sexually transmitted infection. Mother-to-child transmission can occur at the time of delivery and may result in ophthalmia neonatorum or pneumonitis in the neonate. Estimates of the risk of transmission at the time of delivery vary. The risk of mother-to-child transmission resulting in moderate to severe conjunctivitis appears to be approximately 15% to 25% and for pneumonitis 5% to 15%. Postpartum endometritis has also been associated with chlamydial infection, although the risk of this occurring in women infected with chlamydia at the time of delivery is not known.</P>
<P>The drugs of choice for the treatment of Chlamydia trachomatis infection are the tetracyclines; however, as the use of tetracyclines in pregnancy are known to be associated with teeth and bone abnormalities, erythromycin has been recommended as the first-line treatment. Some women find erythromycin unpleasant to take because of nausea and vomiting and this may result in poor compliance which may lead to persisting infection.</P>
<P>As a consequence other antibiotic regimens have been investigated as alternatives to erythromycin.</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>To determine whether antibiotic therapy in women infected with genital Chlamydia trachomatis is effective in the prevention of neonatal chlamydial infection and postpartum endometritis. In the absence of this information, eradication of maternal infection as determined by microbiological cure has been taken as a surrogate outcome. The occurrence of side-effects of treatment is also included.</P>
<P>If antibiotics are effective, the review will seek to determine which antibiotics are effective and review their side-effect profile.</P>

(Seven<I> </I>reports<I> </I>from updated searches been added to <LINK TAG="AWAITING_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Studies awaiting classification</LINK>.)</P>
</STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<STUDY_QUALITY>
<P>We assessed the methodological quality for each included trial using a simple checklist, which included whether the allocated treatment was adequately concealed and the proportion of women lost to follow up. </P>
<P>Overall, the quality of the trials was good. Four of the eleven included trials were double blind and all trials reported losses to follow up. The description of the interventions was good (with the exception of <LINK REF="STD-Martin-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Martin 1997</LINK>) and the main outcome of all the trials was well described in most. </P>
<P>The process by which the interventions were randomly assigned was not well specified in two of the trials, although both papers stated that the allocation was random and both of these trials were double blind (<LINK REF="STD-Alger-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Alger 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bell-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Bell 1982</LINK>).</P>
</STUDY_QUALITY>
<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
<P>Antibiotic therapy for genital chlamydial infection in pregnancy reduces the number of women with positive cultures following treatment by approximately 90% when compared with placebo.</P>
<P>All the tested antibiotic regimens demonstrate a high level of 'microbiological cure' (with the exception of <LINK REF="STD-Martin-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Martin 1997</LINK>, which did not report this outcome). The data suggest that amoxycillin may even be superior to erythromycin in achieving microbiological cure, although this difference is not statistically significant. </P>
<P>When compared with erythromycin the use of amoxycillin was associated with a lower incidence of side-effects in general, and in particular with a lower incidence of side-effects sufficient to stop treatment. With the relatively small amount of data presented, azithromycin appears to be very well tolerated. Side-effects of clindamycin appear to be no different, in frequency, from those of erythromycin.</P>
<P>There is little evidence from any of the included trials that 'microbiological cure' is the same as prevention of neonatal infection or postnatal infection in the mother. One trial (<LINK REF="STD-Alary-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Alary 1994</LINK>), assessed neonatal infection by taking chlamydial cultures from the neonate at one week of age. No positive cultures were found from 152 neonates tested.</P>
</INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>The suggestion that amoxycillin is a useful treatment for genital chlamydial infection is surprising. In vitro studies suggest that Chlamydia trachomatis is relatively insensitive to amoxycillin (<LINK REF="REF-Kuo-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kuo 1977</LINK>). This review, however, suggests very strongly that amoxycillin does eradicate chlamydial infection in pregnancy.</P>
<P>The number of women included in these trials is too small to assess whether the newer antibiotics included in this review such as azithromycin and clindamycin are safe for use in pregnancy, as rare adverse outcomes are unlikely to be detected and clinical experience with their use is limited.</P>
<P>'Microbiological cure' is used in these trials as an alternative to eradication of infection. This assumption may not hold true, however, and the extent to which it is true may vary between the different antibiotics being tested. Thus, if two antibiotics appear to be equally effective in terms of 'microbiological cure' there may still be differences in their effect on more substantive outcomes such as neonatal chlamydial infection. Unfortunately, no trial reported this information in terms of clinical disease.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2012-01-03 12:35:11 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Sonja L  Henderson">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>This review suggests that, in terms of microbiological 'cure', amoxycillin is an effective alternative to erythromycin for women with genital Chlamydia trachomatis infection in pregnancy. The lack of suitable data on the longer-term effectiveness of amoxycillin in terms of the risk of neonatal infection does, however, cause concern about its routine use in clinical practice. </P>
<P>The decision to implement using amoxycillin as the first line treatment for genital Chlamydia trachomatis infection in pregnancy will depend on the extent to which clinicians are satisfied that a negative 'test of cure' in the woman is equivalent to prevention of neonatal infection.</P>
<P>If erythromycin continues to be used as the treatment of choice in pregnancy then there seems little doubt that if women are intolerant of erythromycin then amoxycillin seems a suitable alternative. Clindamycin and azithromycin may be considered further alternatives if erythromycin and amoxycillin are contra-indicated or not tolerated.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2012-01-03 12:35:11 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Sonja L  Henderson">
<P>Further studies are necessary to determine whether amoxicillin is associated with true eradication of Chlamydia trachomatis from the genital tract during pregnancy. Long-term follow up of a cohort of mothers and neonates treated with amoxycillin for genital chlamydial infection in pregnancy to precisely determine the risk of neonatal infection may be enough to reassure clinicians that the treatment is suitable for more widespread use. However, a large randomised comparison of amoxycillin and erythromycin which addressed their relative effectiveness in preventing neonatal infection would be ideal.</P>
<P>The results obtained with clindamycin and azithromycin could usefully be repeated in larger trials which rely more on substantive outcome measures. If amoxycillin is adopted widely as first-line treatment for chlamydia in pregnancy then amoxycillin would be the appropriate control treatment for such trials.</P>
