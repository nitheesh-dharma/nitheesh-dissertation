<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2012-08-23 10:25:43 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Michael H Bennett">
<P>Broken bones (fractures) are very common and sometimes may take a long time to heal or in some cases may fail to heal. The resulting non-union can result in long-term pain and loss of function. The use of hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) has been suggested as a way to enhance healing and treat non-union. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy involves the delivery of oxygen at high pressure to patients in a specially designed chamber (like those used for deep sea divers suffering pressure problems after resurfacing). The aim is to increase the supply of oxygen to the fracture site, which theoretically should improve healing. It should be noted that hyperbaric oxygen therapy may, albeit rarely, result in serious long-term adverse effects.</P>
<P>This review found no evidence from randomised trials to support or refute the use of hyperbaric oxygen therapy to avoid or treat poorly healing broken bones. However, in this update, we found three ongoing randomised trials that are likely to provide some evidence to inform on the use of hyperbaric oxygen therapy in the future.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2012-09-28 14:05:07 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) consists of intermittently administering 100% oxygen at pressures greater than one atmosphere absolute (ATA) in a pressure vessel. This technology has been used to treat a variety of diseases and has been described as helping patients who have delayed healing or established non-union of bony fractures. This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2005, and previously updated in 2008.</P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2012-10-02 12:46:09 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Michael H Bennett">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2012-10-02 11:39:26 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Michael H Bennett">
<P>The treatment of fractures aims to re-establish the structural integrity of the fractured bone and thereby restore function to the injured body part. However, the fracture healing process is sometimes impaired leading to delayed or, in some cases, non-union of the fractured bone. Non-union may be defined as an absent healing process after a duration of six months and is a major complication following skeletal trauma (<LINK REF="REF-Birnbaum-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Birnbaum 2002</LINK>). Both delayed or non-union are usually associated with pain and reduced or loss of function. Rates vary widely with the clinical setting and fracture site. A review of mandibular fractures suggested a rate of 4.8%, while the rate following scaphoid fracture has been estimated at 10% (<LINK REF="REF-Hambidge-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hambidge 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lamphier-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lamphier 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>Poor vascularity (poor/disrupted blood supply), infection, large gaps at the fracture site, unfavourable mechanical circumstances (poor fracture stability/stabilisation) and loss of soft tissues all hinder fracture healing. Non-union is often classified as hypervascular (hypertrophic) or avascular (atrophic) and may occur in the presence or absence of infection. Methods for treating delayed and non-union are multiple and often specific to a particular injury. They include bone grafting, internal and external fixation, extracorporeal shock wave therapy and electrical stimulation (<LINK REF="REF-Biedermann-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Biedermann 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gallay-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gallay 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Simonis-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Simonis 2003</LINK>). These treatments aim to close fracture gaps, provide stability and initiate osteogenesis (bone generation). Whilst it is conventional to stipulate a time limit for fracture healing, the real clinical issue is the potential for bone healing based on an assessment of the factors listed above. In cases where there is a strong possibility of a delayed or non-union, with serious consequences, extra interventions to promote healing are often appropriate. These may include interventions aimed at reducing other known risk factors for delayed healing, such as infection (<LINK REF="REF-Gosselin-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gosselin 2004</LINK>) and smoking (<LINK REF="REF-Hoidrup-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hoidrup 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) is an adjunctive therapy that has been proposed to improve outcome in delayed or non-union. HBOT is the therapeutic administration of 100% oxygen at environmental pressures greater than one atmosphere absolute (ATA). Administration involves placing the patient in an airtight vessel, increasing the pressure within that vessel, and administering 100% oxygen for respiration. In this way, it is possible to deliver a greatly increased partial pressure of oxygen to the tissues. Typically, treatments involve pressurisation to between 1.5 and 3.0 ATA for periods between 60 and 120 minutes once or more daily.</P>
<P>It has been suggested since at least 1966 that HBOT might improve the outcome following bone fractures where delayed or non-healing is likely (<LINK REF="REF-Coulson-1966" TYPE="REFERENCE">Coulson 1966</LINK>). In animal studies, HBOT has been shown to improve both bone generation (<LINK REF="REF-Coulson-1966" TYPE="REFERENCE">Coulson 1966</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Inoue-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Inoue 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tkachenko-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tkachenko 1988</LINK>) and the removal of dead or abnormal bone (<LINK REF="REF-Jones-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jones 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Strauss-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Strauss 1982</LINK>). Benefits were less clear in a more recent study where cats with experimentally induced non-union showed increased bone formation but not improved vascularisation, radiologic appearance or histology (<LINK REF="REF-Kerwin-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kerwin 2000</LINK>). There have been reports of clinical improvement following the application of HBOT to individuals with established non-union (<LINK REF="REF-Atesalp-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Atesalp 2002</LINK>); however, despite nearly 40 years of interest in the delivery of HBOT to patients with these problems, little comparative clinical evidence of effectiveness exists.</P>
<P>HBOT is associated with some risk of adverse effects including damage to the ears, sinuses and lungs from the effects of pressure (a problem lasting from one day to one or two weeks), temporary worsening of myopia (lasting several weeks) and claustrophobia (during therapy). Oxygen poisoning may manifest acutely as a neurologic event (often fitting but only a problem during therapy), or accumulate slowly over a protracted course of HBOT and manifest as a decrease in respiratory function (<LINK REF="REF-Kindwall-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kindwall 2008</LINK>) (may last a few weeks). Although serious adverse events are rare, HBOT cannot be regarded as an entirely benign intervention.</P>

<OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2012-09-28 14:01:40 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Lindsey Elstub">
<P>To assess the evidence for the use of hyperbaric oxygen treatment (HBOT) as an adjunctive therapy for treating actual or expected delayed or non-union of bone fractures. Specifically, we wanted to ask whether the addition of HBOT has an influence on:</P>

Results of comparable groups of trials were to be pooled using the fixed-effect model and 95% confidence intervals. Heterogeneity between comparable trials would have been tested using the I² statistic where required, and consideration given to the appropriateness of pooling.</P>

<P>1. Proportion of participants achieving bony union (definition in each trial to be discussed and the appropriateness of pooling considered). Trials would have been pooled irrespective of the time of final follow-up. Where possible, the results would have been presented according to follow-up up to six months, between six and 12 months, and one year and above.<BR/>2. Time course to achieve union. This outcome may be presented as progress on X-Ray finding or clinical measure of stability. Pooling may be possible for comparable outcome measures.</P>

<P>3. Pain. We anticipated the use of visual analogue scales. Pooling would have been used when possible for comparable outcome measures.<BR/>4. Function. Compatible outcome measures enabling pooling are unlikely in trials testing union for different fracture sites. However, pooling may be undertaken where data are available for the proportion with a poor or worse functional outcome.<BR/>5. Malunion or cosmetic deformity. Pooling may be possible for comparable outcome measures in the future.<BR/>6. Complications and adverse events. Overall numbers of trial participants with complications or adverse effects would have been pooled if data were available.</P>

<P>Where appropriate data exists, we would consider subgroup analysis based on:<BR/>1. Indication for HBOT defined by extent of non-union at entry to studies (accelerated union versus delayed union versus established non-union).<BR/>2. Vascularity of problematic fracture (hypertrophic versus atrophic non-union).<BR/>3. Mode of fixation (internal/external/use of bone graft).<BR/>4. Use of exogenous bone growth factors or electrical field stimulators.<BR/>5. Nature of control group (sham versus no HBOT).<BR/>6. HBOT regimen: dose of oxygen received (pressure, time and length of treatment course).<BR/>7. Site of fracture (weightbearing versus non-weightbearing).</P>
<P>Tests of interaction would be calculated to determine if the results for subgroups are significantly different.</P>

<SENSITIVITY_ANALYSIS MODIFIED="2012-08-23 10:41:31 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Lindsey Elstub">
<P>Where appropriate, we planned sensitivity analyses investigating the effects of including data from trials at high or unclear risk of selection bias (lack of allocation concealment) and detection bias (lack of assessor blinding) and missing data. For the latter we would have conducted best and worst case analyses. The best-case scenario would assume that none of the originally enrolled patients missing from the primary analysis in the treatment group had the negative outcome of interest whilst all those missing from the control group did. The worst-case scenario would be the reverse.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-09-28 14:04:05 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Michael H Bennett">
<P>This review failed to locate any randomised trial evidence to support or refute the treatment of fractures with hyperbaric oxygen therapy, whether to assist the management of complicated acute fractures, or to treat established non-union. Three trials are registered in this area and may provide relevant data in the future (<I>see</I> <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_ONGOING_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of ongoing studies</LINK>). The 'Hyperbaric Oxygen for Lower Limb Trauma' (HOLLT) study is a multinational, non-blinded, randomised trial enrolling patients with crush injuries where there is a complex fracture of the lower leg (<LINK REF="STD-NCT00264511" TYPE="STUDY">NCT00264511</LINK>). Patients are randomised to a standard surgical protocol or the same protocol with adjunctive HBOT in the acute phase. The HOCIF trial is designed to assess complication rates after plating of calcaneal fractures and it is not clear if outcomes relevant to this review will be measured (<LINK REF="STD-NCT01264146" TYPE="STUDY">NCT01264146</LINK>). Finally, the same primary investigator of the HOCIF trial is planning a similar study (HBOTRadius) of distal radius fracture requiring surgical plating (<LINK REF="STD-NCT01365780" TYPE="STUDY">NCT01365780</LINK>). The recruitment status of this trial is unknown. These three trials aim to recruit 250, 160 and 100 participants respectively.</P>

<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2012-09-28 14:04:39 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Michael H Bennett">
<P>While we believe we have located all the relevant human trials studying HBOT in bone fractures, the evidence that HBOT has a positive influence is anecdotal. There are three published randomised controlled trials in this area, but none provided data relevant to this review (<LINK REF="STD-Bouachour-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Bouachour 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lindstrom-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Lindstrom 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Williamson-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Williamson 2006</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Bouachour-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Bouachour 1996</LINK> enrolled 36 patients with crush injuries, 26 of whom had fractures, but measured only soft-tissue outcomes. This trial is included in the Cochrane Review on HBOT for treating acute surgical and traumatic wounds (<LINK REF="REF-Eskes-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eskes 2010</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Lindstrom-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Lindstrom 1998</LINK> enrolled 20 patients requiring intramedullary nailing for closed tibial fractures, but did not report on fracture healing. This trial did report some evidence of improved flow in the posterior tibial artery and in transcutaneous oxygenation in the HBOT group, and postulated these effects may have been secondary to reduced oedema. The significance of these findings for fracture healing is not known. <LINK REF="STD-Williamson-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Williamson 2006</LINK> is a brief report of a randomised trial involving patients with severe open tibial fractures (Gustillo 3B,3C) treated with or without HBOT. It was abandoned after 17 patients and though the patients were followed up, no outcome data were available in the abstract report of this trial. This group is now the primary research centre for the ongoing HOLLT study discussed above.</P>

<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2012-08-23 12:15:08 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Michael H Bennett">
<P>We have located a number of reviews, the most recent of which was published in 2011 (<LINK REF="STD-Barata-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Barata 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Buettner-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Buettner 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Karamitros-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Karamitros 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wang-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2002</LINK>). In general, there is agreement that more work is needed in order to establish or refute the place of HBOT in the treatment of bony fractures, although some of these authors support the use of HBOT on mechanistic grounds and uncontrolled series (<LINK REF="STD-Karamitros-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Karamitros 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wang-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2002</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Buettner-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Buettner 2007</LINK> describes the level of evidence as high in the setting of crush injury and routine treatment as justified. There has been little work specifically on the treatment of fracture non-union.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2012-08-23 12:15:52 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Michael H Bennett">
<P>There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of hyperbaric oxygen therapy for the treatment of fractures, whether to aid healing of acute injuries or as a therapy for established non-union. Further evidence should be generated from trials that are ongoing at the time of writing.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2012-08-23 12:40:33 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Michael H Bennett">
<P>Given the interest in HBOT for this difficult clinical problem, there is a case for achieving clinical trials of high methodological rigour specifically designed to assess the impact of HBOT in complex fractures and non-union. Three trials are underway and there are indications that many of the trial characteristics, identified previously (<LINK REF="REF-Bennett-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bennett 2005</LINK>), will be satisfied in at least one of these trials. Where possible, we have indicated which of these characteristics are likely to be met. All the trials have carefully selected inclusion criteria designed to enrol patients with a specific fracture in order to reduce the possibility of selection bias between groups.</P>
<P>Desirable characteristics of future trials, and an indication if these are likely to be met by the trials underway:<BR/>

<LI>appropriate sample sizes with power to detect expected differences (yes - HOLLT (<LINK REF="STD-NCT00264511" TYPE="STUDY">NCT00264511</LINK>))</LI>

<P>No new trials were identified on updating the search from January 2004 to April 2008.</P>
<P>A total of 68 references were identified. Independent scrutiny of the titles and abstracts identified nine potentially relevant articles. After assessment of the full text, none of these articles met our inclusion criteria. Two gave animal data only (Ueng 1998; Ueng 1999), two dealt with serious vascular injuries in addition to fractures and were not randomised (Porcellini 1997; Zonis 1995), three were case series with no comparator group (Atesalp 2002; Braune 2002; Karapetian 1984) and one was a review containing no new data (Mathieu 1990). The final excluded study was an randomised controlled trial (RCT) of fracture healing that did not record any clinical outcome (Lindstrom 1998). </P>
<P>Note that only <LINK REF="STD-Lindstrom-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Lindstrom 1998</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Mathieu-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Mathieu 1990</LINK> were retained as excluded studies in the 2012 update.</P>
