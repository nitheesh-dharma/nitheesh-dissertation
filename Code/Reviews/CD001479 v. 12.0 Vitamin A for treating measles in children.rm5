<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2011-05-27 22:35:09 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Measles is caused by a virus and possible complications include pneumonia. Measles is a major cause of death in children in low-income countries and is particularly dangerous in children with vitamin A deficiency. Eight studies involving 2574 participants were included in this review and we found that there was no significant reduction in mortality in children receiving vitamin A. However, vitamin A megadoses (200,000 international units (IUs) on each day for two days) lowered the number of deaths from measles in hospitalized children under the age of two years. Two doses of vitamin A are not considered to be too expensive, and are not likely to produce adverse effects.</P>
<P>The authors conclude that vitamin A megadoses appear effective in reducing mortality from measles in children under two years old and have few associated adverse events. There is insufficient evidence to draw conclusions regarding effectiveness in preventing pneumonia or other complications in children. However, the quality of the evidence was generally moderate. Better quality randomized trials are needed to evaluate the efficacy of Vitamin A for treating measles in children.</P>

<P>Two review authors independently assessed the results. We analyzed dichotomous outcomes and expressed results as risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs).

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2011-05-31 07:32:34 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Eight trials met the inclusion criteria (2574 participants). There was no significant reduction in the risk of mortality in the vitamin A group when all the studies were pooled (RR 0.70; 95% CI 0.42 to 1.15). The evidence suggests that vitamin A in a single dose was not associated with a reduced risk of mortality. However, two doses of vitamin A (200,000 international units (IUs) on consecutive days) reduced the mortality in children aged less than two years (RR 0.21; 95% CI 0.07 to 0.66) and pneumonia-specific mortality (RR 0.57; 95% CI 0.24 to 1.37). Two doses of vitamin A reduced the incidence of croup (RR 0.53; 95% CI 0.29 to 0.89) but not pneumonia morbidity (RR 0.92; 95% CI 0.69 to 1.22), nor diarrhea morbidity (RR 0.80; 95% CI 0.27 to 2.34). None of the studies included in this review reported any adverse effects.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2011-05-27 22:35:25 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Measles is still a major cause of childhood morbidity and mortality in some low-income countries. The fatality rate in hospitalized children often exceeds 10% (<LINK REF="REF-Morley-1969a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morley 1969a</LINK>) and case-fatality ratios of up to 20% have been found in community studies in West Africa (<LINK REF="REF-Aaby-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aaby 1984</LINK>). An estimated 36.5 million cases and one million deaths caused by measles still occur each year. About half of these deaths occur in Africa (<LINK REF="REF-MMWR-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">MMWR 1998</LINK>). Measles is by no means limited to low-income countries. There were 1750 cases reported in the Netherlands in 1999 despite a 96% immunization rate in children over 14 months of age (<LINK REF="REF-Sheldon-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sheldon 2000</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2011-05-27 22:36:39 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Vitamin A deficiency is a recognized risk factor in severe measles (<LINK REF="REF-Frieden-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Frieden 1992</LINK>). It is also biologically possible for vitamin A to be of benefit in measles (<LINK REF="REF-Anonymous-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anonymous 1987</LINK>). Vitamin A can, therefore, be used for the treatment of measles and may be beneficial either by reducing the effects of measles infection (therapeutic effect) or preventing the subsequent development of secondary infection (protective effect), or both (<LINK REF="STD-Coutsoudis-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Coutsoudis 1991</LINK>).</P>
<P>Measles can reduce serum concentrations of vitamin A in well-nourished children to levels less than those observed in malnourished children without measles (<LINK REF="REF-Inua-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Inua 1983</LINK>). There are two possible mechanisms to explain how hyporetinemia (an abnormally low level of retinol in the blood) occurs in measles. One explanation is through depletion of hepatic stores. Another possible explanation is that vitamin A is not mobilized fast enough, even in the presence of adequate hepatic stores (<LINK REF="STD-Hussey-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Hussey 1990</LINK>). This could be the reason for hyporetinemia in children with severe measles in areas where vitamin A deficiency is uncommon, such as the Democratic Republic of Congo (<LINK REF="REF-Markowitz-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Markowitz 1989</LINK>), Cape Town (<LINK REF="STD-Hussey-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Hussey 1990</LINK>) and Nairobi (<LINK REF="STD-Ogaro-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Ogaro 1993</LINK>). Retinol (one of the animal forms of vitamin A) concentrations have been found to be depressed in children with measles even in industrialized countries such as the US. The degree of retinol depression is associated with the severity of illness (<LINK REF="REF-Butler-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Butler 1993</LINK>).</P>

<THEORY MODIFIED="2011-05-27 23:07:40 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Ellison-1932" TYPE="STUDY">Ellison 1932</LINK> first documented the protective effect of vitamin A on measles mortality. <LINK REF="STD-Barclay-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Barclay 1987</LINK> drew attention to the importance of vitamin A therapy in reducing measles mortality and led to the 1987 joint recommendation between the World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations International Children's Fund (UNICEF) for the administration of a single oral dose of vitamin A (200,000 international units (IUs), or 100,000 IUs in infants) at the time of initial measles diagnosis in non-xerophthalmic children who lived in areas where measles case-fatality rates were greater than 1% (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1988</LINK>). Xerophthalmia is a severe drying of the eye surface caused by a malfunction of the tear glands. It also occurs in people with immune disorders, most commonly because of decreased intake or absorption of vitamin A. In 1993 the WHO expanded its recommendation to the administration of vitamin A in all cases of severe measles; the dose remained the same (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1993</LINK>). There was sufficient evidence at that time to demonstrate that vitamin A supplementation reduced childhood mortality and morbidity (<LINK REF="REF-Sommer-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sommer 1996</LINK>) but there were only two studies demonstrating the effect of vitamin A in the treatment of children with measles. <LINK REF="STD-Hussey-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Hussey 1990</LINK> confirmed that treatment with vitamin A reduced measles morbidity and mortality. In 1997, the WHO and UNICEF recommended that 200,000 IUs of vitamin A be given twice to children with measles who were over the age of one year and lived in areas where vitamin A deficiency may be prevalent (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>Vitamin A is essential for the maintenance of normal epithelial tissues throughout the body (<LINK REF="REF-Wolbach-1925" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wolbach 1925</LINK>). Measles is a viral disease that infects and damages these tissues (<LINK REF="REF-Morley-1969a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morley 1969a</LINK>). Vitamin A deficiency is known to depress the immune function and destroy epithelial tissue, and measles produces similar effects (<LINK REF="STD-Coutsoudis-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Coutsoudis 1991</LINK>). The combined effect of vitamin A deficiency and measles infection could be serious. Therefore, when a child who has marginal vitamin A stores contracts measles, the already depleted vitamin A stores are exhausted, thereby reducing the ability to resist secondary infections or their consequences (<LINK REF="REF-Bhaskaram-1975" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bhaskaram 1975</LINK>). This would also further accentuate the reduction of immunocompetence that is associated with measles infection (<LINK REF="REF-Whittle-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Whittle 1979</LINK>).</P>
<P>In Asia, measles was found to be an important risk in severe vitamin A deficiency (<LINK REF="REF-Tielsch-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tielsch 1984</LINK>). In a number of community studies in Asia, vitamin A deficiency has been linked to an increased risk of childhood morbidity (<LINK REF="REF-Bloem-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bloem 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Milton-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Milton 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sommer-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sommer 1984</LINK>) and mortality (<LINK REF="REF-Sommer-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sommer 1983</LINK>). Reductions in mortality of 6% to 54% were reported in children who were given vitamin A (<LINK REF="REF-Daulaire-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Daulaire 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Muhilal-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Muhilal 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rahmathullah-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rahmathullah 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sommer-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sommer 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vijayaraghavan-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vijayaraghavan 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-West-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">West 1991</LINK>). In four studies that reported large reductions in mortality, measles mortality fell but acute respiratory infection (ARI) mortality did not change (<LINK REF="REF-Daulaire-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Daulaire 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rahmathullah-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rahmathullah 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-VAST-Study-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">VAST Study 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-West-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">West 1991</LINK>).</P>
<P>Some studies have found vitamin A to have little effect on morbidity, while causing a significant reduction in mortality (<LINK REF="REF-Rahmathullah-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rahmathullah 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rahmathullah-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rahmathullah 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sommer-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sommer 1986</LINK>). Other studies have reported no significant effect on morbidity or mortality even though they were sufficiently large to do so (<LINK REF="STD-Dollimore-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Dollimore 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vijayaraghavan-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vijayaraghavan 1990</LINK>). In some clinical trials, vitamin A reduced the severity of illness and mortality in children with measles (<LINK REF="STD-Barclay-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Barclay 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Coutsoudis-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Coutsoudis 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hussey-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Hussey 1990</LINK>) even in areas where eye signs of vitamin A deficiency were rare (<LINK REF="REF-VAST-Study-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">VAST Study 1993</LINK>).</P>
<P>A meta-analysis (<LINK REF="REF-Glasziou-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glasziou 1993</LINK>) on the role of vitamin A supplementation for infectious diseases found that vitamin A reduced all-cause mortality in children in low-income countries by around one-third. A similar but apparently stronger reduction effect (66%) was seen in children hospitalized with measles, although this was not significantly different from the 30% seen in low-income country community settings. The reduction in deaths from respiratory diseases was seen only in the measles studies. The results of this meta-analysis support the 1987 WHO recommendation that vitamin A be administered to children in areas where vitamin A deficiency is a recognized problem (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1987</LINK>).</P>
<P>In another meta-analysis of 12 controlled trials, including community preventative studies (<LINK REF="REF-Fawzi-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fawzi 1993</LINK>), vitamin A supplementation for hospitalized measles participants (children) was found to be highly protective against mortality. The <LINK REF="REF-Beaton-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beaton 1993</LINK> review concluded that " ... in the specific case of measles, there is evidence that improvement of vitamin A status, even after the onset of infection, can improve both the course of the episode and the case fatality rate".</P>
<P>The <LINK REF="REF-World-Bank-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">World Bank 1993</LINK> study declared vitamin A supplementation to be one of the most cost-effective of all health interventions. Programs to control vitamin A deficiencies are now in place, or planned for, in more than 60 countries (<LINK REF="REF-Sommer-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sommer 1997</LINK>).</P>

<P>Despite all this, the situation is far from satisfactory. According to Ogaro, "the WHO recommendation of vitamin A supplementation has not been implemented in low-income countries because vitamin A deficiency is usually identified because of high rates of xerophthalmia, a problem that exists in only selected places in the developing world. More commonly, developing country populations have inadequate or marginal vitamin A body stores without a high incidence of eye disease. Secondly, not all settings, even in Africa, have high measles case-fatality rates and the usefulness of vitamin A supplementation where mortality and severe complications are much less frequent, has had limited study" (<LINK REF="STD-Ogaro-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Ogaro 1993</LINK>).</P>

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2011-05-27 22:38:14 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two review authors (HY, CW) independently assessed the methodological quality of identified trials. In particular, we examined details of the randomization method, concealment of the treatment allocation schedule, whether the trial was blinded and whether intention-to-treat (ITT) analyses were possible from the available data.</P>
<P>We used the new 'Risk of bias' domains and judgements from the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>), a specific tool for assessing risk of bias in each included study. This comprises a description and a judgement for each entry in a 'Risk of bias' table, where each entry addresses a specific feature of the study (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>Although <LINK REF="STD-Ellison-1932" TYPE="STUDY">Ellison 1932</LINK> was a large study (600 children) we awarded it a low quality score because it was not randomized. Additionally, the quality of health care, availability of antibiotics and immunization have affected the incidence and case-fatalities of measles quite substantially in the last 30 years; however, the case-fatality rate was quite similar to that in studies conducted in Africa 60 years later. We excluded the other 21 studies not for their scores but because vitamin A was given to all children, not just children with measles.</P>
<P>We used the scores from this assessment in a sensitivity analysis (that is, including and excluding studies of low quality to determine how robust the summary effect measures were). Only one study (<LINK REF="STD-Ellison-1932" TYPE="STUDY">Ellison 1932</LINK>) received a score of less than three and we included this in the sensitivity analysis.</P>

<P>To assess the strength of the evidence for giving vitamin A to all children with measles, we carried out a meta-analysis of selected studies in which administration of vitamin A was compared with placebo. We used odds ratios (ORs) and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to calculate the risk ratio (RR) and 95% CI. The data used for calculating the ORs and 95% CIs are available in the Review Manager (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2011</LINK>) forest plots. We calculated mean differences (MDs) with 95% CIs for continuous outcomes using the random-effects model.</P>

We will assess funnel plot asymmetry visually and use formal tests for funnel plot asymmetry. Asymmetry could be due to publication bias or to a relationship between trial size and effect size. For continuous outcomes we will use the test proposed by <LINK REF="REF-Egger-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Egger 1997</LINK>, and for dichotomous outcomes we will use the test proposed by <LINK REF="REF-Harbord-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harbord 2006</LINK>.

<P>As mentioned in the <LINK TAG="STUDY_DESCRIPTION" TYPE="SECTION">Description of studies</LINK>, mortality was the only outcome reported in all trials. Nonetheless, we have reported all results, even those measured and reported by a single study.</P>
<P>It is clear that the studies were heterogeneous in several ways. They were of different durations, in slightly different age groups, using different doses of vitamin A in different formulations (oil- or water-based), in different settings (hospital or community) and in different geographical areas with varying measles case-fatality rates. We attempted to take this into account by using subgroup analyses, but the subgroup analysis has the inconvenience that factors considered for these analyses were highly correlated and therefore their effects cannot be separately identified. This heterogeneity should make one cautious in interpreting the results.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">1. Overall mortality</HEADING>
<P>When the seven high-quality studies reporting on mortality (<LINK REF="STD-Barclay-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Barclay 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Coutsoudis-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Coutsoudis 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dollimore-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Dollimore 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hussey-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Hussey 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kawasaki-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Kawasaki 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ogaro-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Ogaro 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rosales-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Rosales 1996</LINK>) were pooled together, the summary estimate of the effect of vitamin A on the risk of mortality associated with measles was not significant (RR 0.83; 95% CI 0.51 to 1.34). The study carried out by Barclay showed a 48% reduction and Hussey showed a statistically significant 79% reduction in the risk of mortality. The study carried out by Dollimore showed there was no significant difference in risk of mortality. The studies by Rosales and Ogaro were associated with no effect on the risk of mortality in the supplemented group.</P>
<P>Five of the studies were hospital-based. Only the studies by Rosales and Dollimore were carried out in a community setting, in a group of participants with mild disease (i.e. outpatients). Barclay, Hussey and Coutsoudis used 200,000 IU of vitamin A on the first and second days. Coutsoudis gave two additional doses on days eight and 42. These three studies in hospitalized participants (<LINK REF="STD-Barclay-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Barclay 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Coutsoudis-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Coutsoudis 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hussey-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Hussey 1990</LINK>), used at least two doses of vitamin A and were associated with a statistically significant (64%) reduction in the risk of mortality (RR 0.40; 95% CI 0.19 to 0.87). These three studies were also done in areas where the hospital case-fatality rate was more than 10%. The Coutsoudis study had only one death but dropping this study did not change the summary estimate.</P>
<P>Two studies used water-based vitamin A formulations (<LINK REF="STD-Coutsoudis-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Coutsoudis 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hussey-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Hussey 1990</LINK>) while the others used an oil-based formulation. When the studies that used the two-dose regimen were stratified by formulation (whether water- or oil-based) an 81% reduction in the risk of mortality (RR 0.23; 95% CI 0.06 to 0.89) was seen in studies that used water-based preparations. Dollimore used at least two doses of vitamin A and showed there was no significant difference in the risk of mortality in the community between vitamin A-supplemented and placebo groups.</P>
<P>The two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Ogaro-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Ogaro 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rosales-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Rosales 1996</LINK>) that used an oil-based single dose of vitamin A (200,000 IU) were carried out in areas where the case-fatality rate was less than 6% and were not associated with any reduction in the risk of mortality. Vitamin A status appeared to be satisfactory and at least 30% of Ogaro's participants had vitamin A levels greater than 20 ug/dl. These factors, in addition to the fact that a single dose of vitamin A was used in both studies, are probably the major reasons for perceived lack of efficacy of vitamin A treatment.</P>
<P>As part of a sensitivity analysis, when we included the study with a poor methodological quality score (<LINK REF="STD-Ellison-1932" TYPE="STUDY">Ellison 1932</LINK>) vitamin A was associated with a 47% reduction in overall mortality (RR 0.70; 95% CI 0.42 to 1.15). The argument for including this study as part of the sensitivity analysis is that the mortality rates of 8.66 and 3.66 in the placebo and vitamin A groups, respectively, were less than those observed in studies conducted almost 60 years later in Africa. This suggests that basic health care then was not dissimilar to that available in Africa in the 1980s and 1990s. The magnitude of mortality reduction in the Ellison study was remarkably similar to that of the other included studies.</P>
<P>Four of the eight studies reported the age distribution of the participants and the ages of those who died. There was an 83% reduction in risk of mortality (RR 0.21; 95% CI 0.07 to 0.66) in the vitamin A-supplemented group in children under two years of age, in studies that used two doses of 200,000 IU of vitamin A (<LINK REF="STD-Barclay-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Barclay 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Coutsoudis-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Coutsoudis 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hussey-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Hussey 1990</LINK>). The two-dose, oil-based vitamin A was associated with a statistically significant reduction in risk of mortality in the study by Barclay while the water-based preparations almost reached statistical significance (RR 0.23; 95% CI 0.06 to 0.89). There was no evidence of reduction in the risk of mortality in children older than two years (RR 0.98; 95% CI 0.33 to 2.94).</P>
<P>Although the subgroup analyses were determined a priori these factors are highly correlated, which means that their effects cannot be separately identified; and sample sizes were also small. Three significant studies (<LINK REF="STD-Barclay-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Barclay 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Coutsoudis-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Coutsoudis 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hussey-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Hussey 1990</LINK>) present most frequently in all the five subgroup analyses: dose, formulation, hospitalization, age and case-fatality in the study area. They used two doses, hospitalized participants, children under the age of two and were carried out in areas where the case-fatality rate is high. Only Barclay's study slightly deviates from the other two studies as he used an oil-based preparation rather than a water-based formulation. Therefore, the presence of correlated characteristics between these factors cannot be ruled out as firstly the data cannot be stratified because the raw data were not available and, secondly, there were too few studies to stratify across the five subgroups. There were no trials comparing mortality reductions in children with measles who were given a single dose compared to two doses of vitamin A. However, the precision of the estimates from trials that used a single dose was similar to the trials that used two doses.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Pneumonia-specific mortality</HEADING>
<P>Four studies specified the cause of death. Most of the deaths were due to pneumonia. In Ogaro's study (<LINK REF="STD-Ogaro-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Ogaro 1993</LINK>) all children who died had pneumonia, as did 10 out of 18 in the Barclay study (<LINK REF="STD-Barclay-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Barclay 1987</LINK>) and 10 of 12 in Hussey's study (<LINK REF="STD-Hussey-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Hussey 1990</LINK>). The pooled estimate of these studies suggests the risk of pneumonia-specific mortality (RR 0.57; 95% CI 0.24 to 1.37); none of these studies showed statistically significant reductions on their own. Water-based preparations showed no statistically significant reduction in the risk of pneumonia-specific mortality. Ogaro's study used a single dose of vitamin A and did not show any benefit either.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2011-05-27 23:17:54 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Vitamin A in a single dose for treating measles in children was not associated with a reduced risk of mortality. Two doses of vitamin A (200,000 international units (IUs) on consecutive days) reduced the mortality in children aged less than two years and pneumonia-specific mortality. There was no significant reduction in the risk of mortality in the vitamin A group when all the studies were pooled (RR 0.70; 95% CI 0.42 to 1.15). Two doses of vitamin A reduced the incidence of croup but not pneumonia morbidity, nor diarrhea morbidity. However, the mean duration of pneumonia, diarrhea and fever in the intervention groups were shorter, and the mean number of days in hospital in the intervention groups was less.</P>
<P>The quality of most of the trials included in this review is high. The factors included in the subgroup analyses of dose, formulation, setting and age were highly correlated and three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Barclay-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Barclay 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Coutsoudis-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Coutsoudis 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hussey-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Hussey 1990</LINK>) were strongly represented in these analyses.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Dose and formulation</HEADING>
<P>This review demonstrates that vitamin A administered to children with measles and receiving standard treatment was associated with a reduction in mortality when children were under the age of two, hospitalized and the dose (200,000 IU) was repeated on the second day. The evidence partly supports the WHO recommendation of two 200,000 IU doses.</P>
<P>Although the data do not allow us to examine the individual effects of dose and formulation, these are issues that need to be considered. Vitamin A preparations in oil and in water are different in terms of their action in the body over a period of time because of differences in the processes of absorption, distribution, localization in tissues, bio-transformation and excretion. Water-based vitamin A preparations lead to greater absorption, which results in higher serum retinol levels. The oil-based preparation is more stable, readily available and costs less. For these reasons it is the latter that is recommended by WHO.</P>
<P>The Coutsoudis study and others (<LINK REF="REF-Inua-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Inua 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Markowitz-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Markowitz 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Reddy-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reddy 1986</LINK>) support the finding that serum retinol concentrations are lowered during measles. In Coutsoudis' study (<LINK REF="STD-Coutsoudis-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Coutsoudis 1991</LINK>) the supplemented group had significantly higher concentrations than the placebo group, which indicates that the liver stores were not depleted but that there was temporary impairment of mobilization and increased utilization of vitamin A.</P>
<P>The children in the Rosales (<LINK REF="STD-Rosales-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Rosales 1996</LINK>) and Ogaro (<LINK REF="STD-Ogaro-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Ogaro 1993</LINK>) studies may not have benefited from receiving vitamin A oil-based preparations in a single dose (200,000 IU) as this might not have been sufficient to reverse the hyporetinemia occurring during measles; the dose may have been stored, mostly in the liver. Rosales reported a 70% increase in serum retinol after a single dose of oil-based vitamin A. The Rosales study was a community-based study and, therefore, the protective effect of vitamin A may not have been as great as seen in the more severe hospital-based cases.</P>
<P>The results in this review confirm that two doses of vitamin A (200,000 IU) are associated with reductions in the risk of overall mortality and of pneumonia-specific mortality. In 1991, Rosales (<LINK REF="STD-Rosales-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Rosales 1996</LINK>) came to the same conclusion as did Sommer, who suggested that it was prudent to follow the double-dose schedule already proven in the Barclay, Hussey and Coutsoudis trials rather than the single dose recommended by WHO at that time. Doubling the WHO dose was also advocated by Chan (<LINK REF="REF-Chan-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chan 1990</LINK>) and Hussey (<LINK REF="REF-Hussey-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hussey 1997</LINK>). Although use of two doses and the water-based product was associated with a greater reduction in risk of mortality, no recommendation can be made as to whether a single dose of water-based preparation would have a similar benefit as no studies have been conducted looking at the effect of a single dose of water-based vitamin A as compared to two doses. Therefore, single-dose, water-based and oil-based preparations need to be compared to two-dose schedules. The trade-off of using high-dose, oil-based vitamin A versus a water-based formula has to be viewed in terms of the advantages of each product. Although the water-based product may be associated with greater mortality reductions the advantage may be offset by its lower stability, higher cost and non-availability.</P>
<P>One study (<LINK REF="STD-Barclay-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Barclay 1987</LINK>) used two doses of oil-based vitamin A and the effect on overall mortality was not significant on its own, except for children under the age of two years. The evidence for oil-based vitamin A having a protective effect on mortality was demonstrated when an old study by Ellison with a lower quality score was included as part of the sensitivity analysis. Although this study used very small doses of vitamin A (3000 IU for seven days) the supplemented group had statistically significant reductions in risks of mortality, even in the absence of antibiotics and immunization. This study was not randomized and two separate wards were allocated to receive the placebo or vitamin A supplementation. The participants in this study could be comparable to the African children enrolled in the other five studies almost 60 years later as the case-fatality rates in the Ellison study were very similar, and in some cases lower than the case-fatality rate in the placebo and supplemented groups in some more recent studies.</P>
<P>The effect of vitamin A was more pronounced in children under the age of two years as a greater reduction in the risk of mortality was observed in this age group. This was seen across all studies but more so in the studies that used the two-dose regimen (<LINK REF="STD-Barclay-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Barclay 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Coutsoudis-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Coutsoudis 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hussey-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Hussey 1990</LINK>). In children under the age of two years formulation did not make any difference as the oil-based product was associated with a statistically significant reduction in the risk of mortality and the water-based vitamin A effect almost reached statistical significance. The study by Markowitz et al (<LINK REF="REF-Markowitz-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Markowitz 1989</LINK>) highlighted the fact that children aged less than two years of age with low vitamin A levels had a higher risk of dying than those with higher levels; the number of children in the age group older than two years were too few to detect any statistically significant difference.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Case-fatality rate in country of study</HEADING>
<P>As the studies using two doses (<LINK REF="STD-Barclay-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Barclay 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Coutsoudis-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Coutsoudis 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hussey-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Hussey 1990</LINK>) were from areas where case-fatality was more than 10% it is important to be careful in generalizing the results. It raises the issue of whether the decrease in mortality was a result of the higher dose, or whether the vitamin A supplementation in higher case-fatality areas had a greater effect, as there was a greater potential for mortality decline in those populations. It may be possible that there would be a decline in mortality even with a single dose of vitamin A in high case-fatality areas and this needs to be further explored. Although in South Africa the measles case-fatality rate was greater than 10% in hospitals, Coutsoudis had low case-fatality rates in both the vitamin A and control groups. She remarked that this could be attributed to the absence of emergency and malnourished cases.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Hospital versus community studies</HEADING>
<P>The protective effect of vitamin A supplementation was seen only in hospitalized children. Hospitalization may be a measure of severity of illness. There is the possibility that more severe clinical cases of measles are more likely to benefit from vitamin A treatment. Three of the four hospital-based studies (<LINK REF="STD-Barclay-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Barclay 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Coutsoudis-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Coutsoudis 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hussey-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Hussey 1990</LINK>) which used the two-dose regimen demonstrated a protective effect on mortality. These studies were done under controlled conditions and their follow up was relatively brief. Only the Coutsoudis study indicated some long-term benefit of vitamin A as children were followed for six months; the outcomes used for this review were at the time of discharge from hospital. These factors affect the generalizability of the results to the general population of patients with measles.</P>
<P>An absence of vitamin A effect, or a smaller effect, in the community studies (<LINK REF="STD-Dollimore-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Dollimore 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rosales-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Rosales 1996</LINK>) may be due to the study populations being healthier than the studies in hospitals. The community studies did not include children who were very sick as they were referred for hospitalization. The Rosales and Dollimore studies differed from the other studies in patient setting, follow up, disease severity, patient age, vitamin A preparation used and analytical approach. They looked at ambulatory participants who were followed up closely for one month with daily and weekly visits to urban health centres. This reflects the patient-care conditions under which the majority of measles cases are diagnosed and treated in low-income countries (<LINK REF="STD-Dollimore-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Dollimore 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rosales-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Rosales 1996</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Baseline differences and the presence of complications on admission</HEADING>
<P>The demographic, nutritional, immunological and clinical status at baseline all affect the comparability between the vitamin A-treated and control groups (<LINK REF="STD-Coutsoudis-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Coutsoudis 1991</LINK>). Although all the studies reported the baseline nutritional status of the vitamin A-supplemented and placebo groups only, Barclay specified the nutritional status of the children who died; vitamin A recipients suffered lower mortality at every nutritional level.</P>
<P>In the Ogaro study (<LINK REF="STD-Ogaro-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Ogaro 1993</LINK>) 10 children were severely malnourished in the vitamin A-supplemented group and five children in the placebo group. This raises an issue about whether randomization balanced this important confounder. This could have been an important difference, possibly resulting in an inability to demonstrate a protective effect of vitamin A in the supplemented group. All the deaths in this study were due to pneumonia (five in the vitamin A group and three in the placebo group).</P>
<P>Five of the studies were carried out in Africa. The baseline prevalence of vitamin A deficiency and other baseline characteristics vary across countries and even within the same country, as in South Africa. The health services in the five areas of the included studies could be different and this could be one of the reasons, in addition to dose, that the studies showed different results.</P>
<P>Rosales suggested that as the population in his study was a healthier population than in previous studies this may explain an absence of, or smaller, vitamin A effect compared with that found in other studies (<LINK REF="STD-Rosales-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Rosales 1996</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Morbidity</HEADING>
<P>In Hussey's study 64% of children had diarrhea and pneumonia on admission; while in Barclay's study pneumonia was the most frequent complication, affecting 85 children: 43% in the vitamin A group and 51% in the control group.</P>
<P>Most of the morbidity outcomes are either based on single or two studies, except for croup. As all studies did not report on all possible morbidity outcomes the conclusions we were able to draw about the effect of vitamin A on measles-related morbidity are limited.</P>
<P>There was a significant decrease in the incidence of croup with vitamin A supplementation while there was no significant reduction in the incidence of pneumonia, although a reduction was observed in the duration of diarrhea, pneumonia, fever, hospital stay and cough. Treatment of measles cases with vitamin A also has relevance to high-income countries as a reduction is seen in morbidity outcomes in Kawasaki's study. The Kawasaki (<LINK REF="STD-Kawasaki-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Kawasaki 1999</LINK>) study reported no mortality and the morbidity outcomes were not pooled with those of the other studies as this study was from a developed country, that is Japan; it used only a single dose of 100,000 IU of vitamin A.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Limitations of this review</HEADING>
<P>Nutritional status is an important predictor of vitamin A deficiency and mortality. The small number of studies and sample sizes have made it difficult to stratify or do a meta-regression. The subgroup analyses are very restricted as the same studies are represented in all of them. The apparent differences between trials may be related to the subgroup but could equally be confounded by some other aspect of trial design.</P>
<P>In these trials it was not always apparent as to which day after the onset of measles vitamin A was administered. Another limitation is that the follow-up period is not the same in all studies. It is assumed that all have been followed up until they were discharged from hospital. For the purposes of this review, the outcomes were taken at the time of discharge, hence it is not possible to make comparisons for delayed mortality across these studies.</P>
<P>It would have been useful to have the baseline incidence of measles in the study populations reported and if there were epidemics during the study period. The cases enrolled during a measles epidemic could vary in severity from measles cases at other times.</P>
<P>There was also a lack of reporting on the immunization status of children in the general population and in the study population, which was reported in only two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Dollimore-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Dollimore 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hussey-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Hussey 1990</LINK>). The level of immunization would have had an impact on the severity of measles as it could reduce the intensity of exposure and hence the dose of the infecting virus (<LINK REF="REF-Hussey-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hussey 1997</LINK>). This would have had an impact on the severity of the disease as well as the severity of any epidemic. The severity of measles would be less in already vaccinated children (showing vaccine failure) and in areas where the immunization coverage was high.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Cost</HEADING>
<P>Vitamin A is not only effective but also cost-saving. Hussey (<LINK REF="STD-Hussey-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Hussey 1990</LINK>) demonstrated that the duration of hospital stay for children given vitamin A was decreased by an average of 4.7 days; by half a day in another study (<LINK REF="STD-Kawasaki-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Kawasaki 1999</LINK>). The cost of a dose of vitamin A is around USD 0.02 (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1998</LINK>). At this cost ... "to achieve significant reductions in hospitalizations and costs in terms of mortality and long-term morbidity, vitamin A therapy for the management of measles is highly cost-effective" (<LINK REF="REF-Cervinskas-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cervinskas 1996</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Side effects</HEADING>
<P>Until 1993, there were no reports of acute vitamin A toxicity in children with measles who took the WHO recommended dose as reported by the Committee on Infectious Diseases of the American Academy of Pediatrics (<LINK REF="REF-Pediatrics-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pediatrics 1993</LINK>). Even doses up to 400,000 IU have been reported to be relatively safe (<LINK REF="REF-Frieden-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Frieden 1992</LINK>). None of the studies included in this review reported any adverse effects.</P>
<P>Headaches, loss of appetite, vomiting and bulging fontanelles (in infants) are some of the known adverse effects occasionally occurring with the administration of high doses of vitamin A. However, these symptoms are minor and transitory, with no known long-term effects and requiring no special treatment (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1998</LINK>). Under these circumstances it would appear that two doses of vitamin A are not too expensive, not likely to produce adverse effects and still have the capacity to reduce morbidity and mortality.</P>

<P>In these trials there was a lack of information regarding the baseline vitamin status of these children, and also a lack of information about whether children had received previous vitamin A supplements prior to the onset of measles.</P>
<P>Not every study collected information on recovery from morbidity. We had some concerns about whether some trial authors collected data but later chose not to report these findings.

<P>The conclusions of this review are in keeping with the previous three reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Beaton-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beaton 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fawzi-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fawzi 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Glasziou-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glasziou 1993</LINK>), which were carried out at a time when only three trials (<LINK REF="STD-Barclay-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Barclay 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Coutsoudis-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Coutsoudis 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hussey-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Hussey 1990</LINK>) were available. These are also the studies using two doses and showing a protective effect on measles mortality in the children treated with vitamin A. Later studies (<LINK REF="STD-Dollimore-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Dollimore 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kawasaki-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Kawasaki 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ogaro-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Ogaro 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rosales-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Rosales 1996</LINK>) used a single dose or more doses of oil-based vitamin A and did not show reduced measles mortality. Hence, authors of earlier reviews were not able to compare dosages in subgroup analyses. In addition, Fawzi's meta-analysis (<LINK REF="REF-Fawzi-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fawzi 1993</LINK>) included Ellison's study of 1932 (<LINK REF="STD-Ellison-1932" TYPE="STUDY">Ellison 1932</LINK>). Although it is a large study it has been included in this review only as part of the sensitivity analysis as it received a low quality score. It may also be worth mentioning that the objectives of those reviews were different from the objective of this review.</P>
<P>The findings of this review are consistent with one of the largest observational studies that reported on mortality as an outcome (<LINK REF="REF-Hussey-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hussey 1997</LINK>). A retrospective hospital record review of 1720 cases of measles, during 1985 to 1986, and 1989 to 1990, was carried out. There were 651 children in the latter time period who received two doses of vitamin A (200,000 IU) and had a shorter hospital stay, lower requirement for intensive care and lower death rate as compared to 1069 children during 1985 to 1986 who received a single dose of 3000 IU.</P>
<P>This review confirms that two doses of vitamin A are associated with a statistically significant reduction in the risk of overall mortality. The only conclusion that can be drawn with any degree of certainty is that high doses of oil- or water-based vitamin A are associated with greater reductions in mortality in children under the age of two years. It is possible that, in high doses, oil-based and water-based vitamin A have similar effects in children under the age of two years. Therefore, in this age group formulation did not make any difference. On the other hand, as studies that used two doses were also done in high case-fatality areas, there was no evidence to show that a single dose would not be effective as there were no studies using a single dose of oil-based vitamin A in these areas. Similarly, subgroup analyses by causes of morbidity and mortality by age group and formulation could not be done as the information was not available.</P>

<P>We support the WHO recommendation that two doses of vitamin A (200,000 IU) be given to all cases of measles, especially to children under the age of two with severe measles, in addition to the standard treatment. The evidence from these studies can only be generalized in relation to low-income countries. There is limited information to permit a generalization in relation to high-income countries. The only study carried out in a high-income country (Japan) used one-fourth of the recommended dose (100,000 IU), showed a reduced morbidity and did not report any toxicity.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2011-05-27 22:52:34 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review has shown that mortality reductions were observed in hospitalized children under the age of two years who were given two doses of vitamin A, and in areas where the case-fatality rate was greater than 10%. This review was unable to separate out which of these factors contributed a greater benefit of vitamin A in preventing mortality. Therefore, randomized controlled trials need to be conducted that would compare single doses (200,000 IU) of oil- or water-based vitamin A with two doses, and have sufficiently large sample sizes that the results could be stratified across subgroups for age, geographical areas with low and high case-fatality rates, and hospitalized and non-hospitalized children.</P>
<P>To study the benefits in children older than two years of age, more children in this age group need to be enrolled. If trials are conducted, trialists should report on all outcomes and baseline data including age, nutritional status, immunization status, immunization coverage of the general population, complications on enrolment and vitamin A levels. In addition, the number of deaths and morbidity conditions should be reported in each of these subgroups.</P>

<SUP>1. </SUP>The evidence from these studies can only be generalized in relation to low-income countries. There is limited information to permit a generalization in relation to high-income countries. The only study carried out in a developed country (Japan) used one-fourth of the recommended dose (100,000 IU), showed a reduced morbidity and did not report any toxicity.<BR/>
<SUP>2. </SUP>All the Vitamin A supplements in the eight trials included in this review were administrated orally. Two studies used water-based vitamin A formulations while the other three used an oil-based formulation. Different doses of vitamin A were used in this review.<BR/>
<SUP>3. </SUP>Three trials recruited high-risk participants defined as those living in areas with case-fatality &gt; 10% or aged two years or less. The incidence for five trials that excluded high-risk participants was 9.8% and the incidence for the two trials that recruited high-risk participants (with at least one risk factor) was 10.7%. We have rounded these off to 98 and 107 per 1000 respectively.</P>

<P>We believe it is imperative that the Cochrane Collaboration examine the &#8220;Vitamin A for treating measles in children&#8221; review by Huiming Y, Chaomin W, and Meng M. The review incorrectly includes a study by Dollimore et al. and as a result attenuates the therapeutic effect estimates for vitamin A treatment of measles. The Dollimore study is a sub-analysis of the Ghana Vitamin A Supplementation Trials [VAST] that administered vitamin A to children prior to onset of measles; which should have excluded the study from the review since the objective was to determine &#8220;whether vitamin A therapy, commenced after measles has been diagnosed, is beneficial in preventing mortality&#8221;. The design and methodology of the VAST can be found in the Lancet (Ghana VAST Study Team. Vitamin A supplementation in northern Ghana: effects on clinic attendances, hospital admissions, and child mortality. Lancet 1993;342:7-12).<BR/>
<BR/>Vitamin A treatment for measles is currently recommended by the WHO and as a result this review needs to be corrected in a timely manner.  Please do not hesitate to contact us.</P>
</FEEDBACK_SUMMARY>
<FEEDBACK_REPLY MODIFIED="2011-05-27 23:26:52 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In the Dollimore study, the authors described the study methods as follows:</P>
<P>Fieldworkers visited children every four months for two years, in seven survey rounds. Those aged six months or over at a visit were given a dose of vitamin A (100,000 IU of retinol equivalent for children aged 6 to 11 months or 200,000 IU for older children) or placebo. Children were recorded as "present," "temporarily absent," "moved away," or "died" at each of these visits. At each round, information was obtained on illnesses within the past week, the child's weight, and left mid-upper arm circumference and, from the second dosing round, on hospitalization or measles since the last visit. In the first data collection round, information was obtained on whether each child had ever been hospitalized or had ever had measles.</P>
<P>So it is difficult to determine whether the children received Vitamin A before or after onset of measles. We should analyze the results carefully.</P>
<P>Thank you very much.</P>

<P>For the first version of the review published in <I>The Cochrane Library</I> 2001, Issue 1, the authors used the search strategy developed by the Cochrane Acute Respiratory Infections Group (<LINK REF="REF-Cochrane-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cochrane 1999</LINK>). A MEDLINE (PubMed) search was conducted in July 1999 (1994 to 1998). <I>The Cochrane Library </I>at that time (1999, Issue 4) included search results of MEDLINE (1966 to 1997) and EMBASE (1974 to 1997). Keywords used were measles, vitamin A, randomized, controlled trial, respiratory disease, pneumonia, random allocation and clinical trial. Sixty-six references were found using this search strategy.</P>
<P>In the previous updated review we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (<I>The Cochrane Library</I> 2005, Issue 1); MEDLINE (1966 to March 2005) and EMBASE (1980 to December 2004). We also searched references of the available primary studies, review articles and editorials to identify trials not found in the database searches. We found two additional trials (<LINK REF="STD-Chowdhury-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Chowdhury 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dollimore-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Dollimore 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>In this updated review we again searched CENTRAL (<I>The Cochrane Library</I> 2009, Issue 1) which contains the Cochrane Acute Respiratory Infections Group's Specialized Register; MEDLINE (1966 to March week 2 2009) and EMBASE (1980 to March 2009). We retrieved eight records, but did not include or exclude any new trials.</P>
<P>We used the following terms in MEDLINE and CENTRAL and adapted them for EMBASE. The highly sensitive search strategy was combined with the MEDLINE search strategy (<LINK REF="REF-Lefebvre-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lefebvre 2011</LINK>).</P>
