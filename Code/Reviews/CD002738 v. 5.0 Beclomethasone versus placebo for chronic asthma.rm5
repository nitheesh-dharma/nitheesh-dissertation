Please reference Reem's protocol for head to head comparisons and mention this in selection criteria in the abstract and review.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;References: /fine. What a diverse mix of outcome measures and asthma severity!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Table of included studies: Good. What did you regard as adequate allocation concealment (out of interest)? ANYTHING DONE OFF SITE, OR ANYTHING REPORTED AS BEING DONE BY A THIRD PARTY. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Metaview Labels: *************I am sorry but you will need to revise all the outcomes that have negative lung function (ie placebo is on the right). Please change 7#2 to random as default on metaview. DON'T BE SORRY. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Synopsis: You need to explain CFC and HFA in the synopsis as readers will not know what you are talking about. TRIED THIS. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abstract: Please check the bold results. WMD for beta 2 use should have a negative sign and change to SMD in 7#11 also. Cannot see where RR for withdrawals from exacerbations comes from (THIS DOES NOT MATCH THE RESULTS IN MAIN TEXT OF 0.25). Oral steroid dose given negative sign as it has gone down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: See bold red sentence. Needs amending to include I-square (and add BMJ reference).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results:  Bold red results need treating please. FEV1 from baseline - subgroup results removed as they are misleading.

Once again, thanks for the time you've spent going through this review. I've&lt;br&gt;attached a copy of the text of the review (RTF) above. I've left the few changes I've made in BOLD PURPLE. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think the summary you've included in the discussion about the CFC data strikes a good balance, and haven't changed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other things&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CONSISTENCY &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. We need to ensure that the treatment effect reports are consistently either in round () or square [] brackets, and that we decide on whether to put the units for the effect measure in with the CI values or not. In the original review version I adopted the following convention:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eg. PEF 34 L/min (95% CI -2 to 40 L/min)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However I've noticed some of the effect measures are reported as:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eg. PEF 34 L/min [40, -2].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'd prefer to stick to the former - what do you think? Either way need to ensure that all are the same. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. HFA-BDP or HFA BDP, CFC-BDP or CFC BDP  - a few instances of both: the former better I think&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Best Wishes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nick&lt;br&gt;-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br&gt;020804: NPA wrote: &lt;br&gt;Hi Toby,&lt;br&gt;                I&amp;#8217;m sorry for the delay in getting this back to you. Thanks for the work you&amp;#8217;ve put into this. I&amp;#8217;ve attached the exported RTF review text as above &amp;#8211; your original comments are still in red but I&amp;#8217;ve made some minor changes to the wording and corrected typos&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think your solution regarding the crossovers is a good one. It means the original studies can be retained and scrutinized, but makes clear a change in inclusion criteria for this and future updates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve reworded the sections in red a little that you put in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I would remove comparison 15, 16 and 17 &amp;#8211; see my notes below from original comments: what do you think about this?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;c) Subgroup Analyses&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reem has fashioned subgroup analyses (Comparisons 15, 16, 17) for the HFA-BDP studies based on dose, duration and delivery device. However I don&amp;#8217;t think they can really mean anything because there were only a total of two studies (Hampel and Nayak) that used this propellant. With so few studies, which end up in different subgroups, one is essentially comparing two individual studies, not doing a pooled subgroup analysis. I think these should be removed (I have highlighted the sections in the review text that I think should be changed). If this is removed the Table of Comparisons will need to be edited and renumbered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reem has also expanded the original CFC-BDP subgroup analyses by adding in a lot of outcomes which are only reported by individual studies, see:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Comparisons 06 Outcomes 08, 09, 12-22  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Comparisons 07 Outcomes 14, 15, 23-35&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#8217;t think this makes any sense and would remove them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;e) Table of Comparisons&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Comparison 13 HFA BDP 160 &amp;#8211; 200 mcg/d versus placebo&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Outcome 14 - only one study therefore stat analysis changed to &amp;#8216;subtotals only&amp;#8217;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Outcome 15 - only one study therefore stat analysis changed to &amp;#8216;subtotals only&amp;#8217;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Outcome 16 - only one study therefore stat analysis changed to &amp;#8216;subtotals only&amp;#8217;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Outcome 28 - only one study therefore stat analysis changed to &amp;#8216;subtotals only&amp;#8217;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I would completely remove comparison 14 from the meta-analysis. This was not an oral steroid titration study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Comparison 15 HFA-BDP v placebo: all doses (? Remove completely &amp;#8211; see notes above)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Comparison 16 HFA BDP v placebo: all study durations (? Remove completely &amp;#8211; see notes above)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Outcomes 08, 12, 13, 14 and 17 have the wrong subgroups. These should be 4 weeks/ greater than  4 weeks, but the subgroups are by dose. Clearly a mistake &amp;#8211; Reems needs to check the data for these and make the corrections or (as suggested above) simply remove these comparisons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br&gt;TJL070604 - Changes made as per Nick's revision 070604.&lt;br&gt;-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br&gt;Exported from Review Manager 4.2.1&lt;br&gt;Exported from Review Manager 4.2.3&lt;br&gt;Short title (no longer in use): The effectiveness of inhaled beclomethasone&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the version that NPA has reviewed after looking through the comments and suggestions made by the Copy Editor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The following comments were made. I have responded and indicated which changes I have done after each Question put by the copy editior. Last chnage made 09 02 02 in this version.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Comments on Inhaled beclomethasone versus placebo for chronic asthma&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To do:&lt;br&gt;1.Date protocol and review first published.&lt;br&gt;2.It was edited on 19/11/02 but there is nothing in What's New dates, should this be updated?&lt;br&gt;3.Data extraction (1) Where outcomes were evaluated at a number of time points, we only used data from the last evaluable time point. What do you mean?  Evaluable not a word, can we replace evaluable with known?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I've simply removed the word 'evaluable' and left the text as saying &amp;quot;we only used data from the last time point&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;4.Results: PEFR - morning PEFR - which four studies? Should these not be references and linked?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes this has been done&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;5. I think &amp;quot;diary morning card&amp;quot; is a little succinct- maybe it should be expanded just a little bit e.g. presented data in their daily health diary for the morning measurement of PEFR.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Replaced with &amp;quot;presented data for home diary card recorded morning PEFR&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;6.RESCUE BETA2 AGONIST USE -6 parallel group studies, which studies? Two studies (41 patients) needs a references, which studies?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This has been done&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;7.BRONCHIAL HYPER-RESPONSIVENESS (BHR) - which 4 studies (61 participants - reference?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This has been done&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;8.BRONCHIAL HYPER-RESPONSIVENESS (BHR) Should PC100Sraw be mentioned in outcomes as it is mentioned here. Found definition in footnotes of included studies and inserted into text.  In outcomes, number 4 histamine challenge is PC20 FEV1, PD20.  The next sentence says when both studies were pooled so which studies? Kjerstens 1994 and?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second study is Wiebicke 1990 - corrected &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;9.Inserted link to Wiebicke 1990 and Pennings 1997 beginning of last paragraph of BRONCHIAL HYPER-RESPONSIVENESS (BHR) after two studies. Please check this is correct.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;yes&lt;br&gt;10.ASTHMA EXACERBATIONS - second paragraph -9 studies (830 subjects) - what are they? Insert references and link. Three studies were in children, five in adults and one in children and adults: I think you should probably insert references and links to those with children, adults and both.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This has been done&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;11.ASTHMA EXACERBATIONS Two studies (117 patients), insert reference and links&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This has been done&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;12.ASTHMA EXACERBATIONS Treatment with BDP 1000 mcg/d or greater (four studies adults, one children and adults, 159 subjects)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This has been done&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;13.ASTHMA EXACERBATIONS When all studies were pooled a significant effect in favour of BDP was apparent, RR 0.26 (95% CI 0.15 to 0.43). Is this all 9 studies again?  Insert nine if this is the case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No it is all 16 - I don't think it helps the flow of the text to put them all in again&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;14.LOCAL SIDE EFFECTS, no reference to which 6 parallel studies, which 3 studies 488 patients, one study 93 subjects, two studies (254 subjects) what are their references.  Insert them and link.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This has been done&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;15.Kept (1) before spirometry, and inserted other numbers but please check that this is Ok for this section, then put in numbers for other three sections. Please check this is correct.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fine &lt;br&gt;16.I changed the heading round for non-oral steroid treated asthmatics to make it consistent with the following headings for ASTHMATICS TREATED WITH OCS: OCS-SPARING STUDY DESIGN &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The copy editor had replaced the results sub-title&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;NON ORAL STEROID TREATED ASTHMATICS&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;with&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;ASTHMATICS TREATED WITH NON ORAL STEROIDS&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;this does'nt make sense.&lt;br&gt;I've changed it back to :&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;ASTHMATICS NOT TREATED WITH ORAL CORTICOSTEROIDS (OCS)&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;17.ORAL STEROID TREATED ASTHMATICS - two studies mentioned, insert reference&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NOT CLEAR ABOUT THIS POINT - WHERE DOES THE EDITOR MEAN EXACTLY?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;18.In footnotes of included studies table could you put abbreviations and explanations for ICS, OCS, ( IGF-1, TGF-betal, PDGF in Hoshino 1998), (RV, VC, MMFR, DLCO in Toogood 1977).

<WHATS_NEW NOTES="&lt;p&gt;CHANGES IN THE INTERVENTIONS&lt;br&gt;When the review was first published in 1999, only the conventional form of  beclomethasone&amp;quot;CFC&amp;quot; was addressed in the review. New studies have been conducted in order to test the efficacy of the new BDP formula &amp;quot; HFA&amp;quot; in comparison with placebo. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;CHANGES IN THE INCLUSION CRITERIA&lt;br&gt;Following discussion between the reviewers, it was felt that prospective inclusion of crossover studies and studies of less than 4 weeks may be subject to under-estimates of the treatment effect. We no longer report the effects of studies under 4 weeks and studies of crossover design, although they have been retained in the meta-analysis graphs for thoroughness. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;NEW EVIDENCE&lt;br&gt;Eight additional randomised controlled trials of high quality were eligible for inclusion as of January 2003. Three trials (Hampel 2000, Nayak 2002, Gross 1999), compared the efficacy of different doses of HFA-BDP (BDP delivered with a novel propellent) with placebo. For the additonal five CFC-BDP studies (Gross 1999; Hampel 2000; Hoshino 2001; Laviolette 1999; Malmstrom 1999), the confidence intervals tightened around lung function where new data were added. Of the new studies Nayak 2002 recruited only children. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;NEW FINDINGS&lt;br&gt;These trials reported significant effects in terms of lung function. Weak evidence from this review indicates that there may be a steep dose response curve in the lower dose ranges of HFA-BDP, and this finding requires confirmation in further studies including head-to-head studies comparing relative efficacy of HFA-BDP and CFC-BDP. Ascertaining a timepoint at which steroids become clinically effective remains an important issue, as this may affect the validity of effect estimates from clinical trials conducted under 4 weeks. Evidence for paediatric and older populations (&amp;gt;65 years) remains scarce. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;">

<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2008-07-21 14:10:13 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>During an asthma attack, the airways narrow, causing breathing problems, wheezing and coughing. Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) are used to reduce swelling of the airways. Inhaled beclomethasone dipropionate (BDP) is commonly used. There is now a new formulation of the drug which uses a new propellant (HFA-BDP). This review of trials found that BDP<B> </B>delivered with the old and new propellant is<B> </B>effective in helping people with chronic asthma. BDP at all doses improves airflow, reduces symptoms and the need for rescue bronchodilators. The review only included studies conducted for more than 4 weeks. The drug was well tolerated and the safety profile was comparable with placebo. The findings apply to both children and adults. The effects of the new propellant suggest that it could be more effective than the older version, although a different review will address that particular question.<B> </B>

<ABSTRACT MODIFIED="2008-07-21 14:10:03 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Inhaled beclomethasone dipropionate (BDP) has been, together with inhaled budesonide, the mainstay of anti-inflammatory therapy for asthma for many years. A range of new prophylactic therapies for asthma is becoming available and BDP has been reformulated using a hydrofluoroalkane-134a (HFA) propellant which is free from chlorofluorocarbon (CFC).</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>The objectives of this review were to: <BR/>(1) Compare the efficacy of BDP with placebo with both CFC and HFA propellants in the treatment of chronic asthma.<BR/>(2) Explore the possibility that a dose response relationship exists for BDP in the treatment of chronic asthma.<BR/>(3) To provide the best estimate of the efficacy of BDP as a benchmark for evaluation of newer asthma therapies.</P>

CFC-BDP (57 studies): In non-oral steroid treated patients, at doses of 400mcg/day or less CFC-BDP produced significant improvements from baseline in a number of efficacy measures compared with placebo, including forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) 360 ml (95% CI 260 to 460); FEV1 (% predicted) WMD 12.41% (95% CI 8.18 to 16.64) and morning peak expiratory flow rate (am PEF) WMD 35.95 L/min (95% CI 27.85 to 44.04). BDP also led to reductions in rescue beta-2 agonist use compared with placebo of -2.32 puffs/d (95% CI -2.55 to -2.09) and reduced the relative risk (RR) of trial withdrawal due to an asthma exacerbation 0.25 (95% CI 0.12 to 0.51). Subgroup analyses based on treatment duration provide support to the proposal that a treatment period of greater than four weeks is required to realise a fuller treatment effect. In oral steroid treated patients BDP led to significantly greater reductions in oral prednisolone use WMD -4.91 mg/d (95% CI -5.88 to -3.94 mg/d) and greater likelihood of withdrawing oral steroid treatment RR 8.02 (95% CI 3.23 to 19.92). HFA-BDP (3 studies): In non-oral steroid-treated patients, HFA-BDP was significantly more effective than placebo in improving FEV1, morning and evening PEF, FEF25 to 75%, reduced asthma symptoms and beta2-agonists daily consumption. Significant effects for such outcomes were apparent after six weeks of treatment. In oral steroid treated patients, HFA-BDP improved significantly FEV1 and am PEF. The summary estimates for these outcomes suggested a high level of heterogeneity, and divergent aims of the studies may contribute to the variation we observed. Limited data on adverse events were reported.<BR/>

</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>This review has quantified the efficacy of CFC-BDP and HFA-BDP in the treatment of chronic asthma and strongly supports its use. Current asthma guidelines recommend titration of dose to individual patient response, but the published data provide little support for dose titration above 400 mcg/d in patients with mild to moderate asthma. There are insufficient data to draw any conclusions concerning dose-response in people with severe asthma.<BR/>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-07-21 14:10:20 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) have been available for the treatment of asthma for over 40 years, and are recommended at an early stage in national and international management guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-BTS-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">BTS 2003</LINK>). Greatest experience has been gained with beclomethasone dipropionate (BDP) which has been available since the early 1970's. Many controlled and uncontrolled studies assessing the clinical effectiveness and safety of the drug have been conducted and there is a consensus opinion that BDP has a favourable clinical therapeutic index (i.e. effective with low risk of side effects) when treating chronic asthma. A number of issues remain to be clarified however. These include the extent to which the size of clinical response is influenced by treatment dose, patient age, asthma severity and treatment duration.</P>
<P>There has been a recent drive to produce aerosol consumables, including pressurised metered dose inhalers (pMDIs) that are free of chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) propellants. CFCs are being phased out in all manufactured products because of environmental concerns. Therefore BDP delivered via pMDI has been reformulated using a hydrofluoroalkane-134a (HFA) propellant. In this formulation BDP is delivered in a solution, rather than in suspension as is the case with conventional CFC-BDP. HFA-BDP with its small particle size allows a higher proportion of the drug to deposit in the lung small airways. The changeover policy from CFC-BDP into HFA-BDP has been established in many countries.</P>
<P>This review aims to synthesise the findings from studies that have compared BDP, with it's two different propellants, HFA and CFC, to placebo in the treatment of chronic asthma.</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>The objectives of this review were to:</P>
<P>(1) Compare the efficacy of inhaled beclomethasone dipropionate (CFC-BDP) with placebo in the treatment of chronic asthma. </P>
<P>(2) Compare the efficacy of inhaled beclomethasone dipropionate (HFA-BDP) with placebo in the treatment of chronic asthma.<B>
<BR/>
</B>
<BR/>(3) Explore whether a dose response relationship exists for BDP in the treatment of chronic asthma.</P>
<P>(4) Provide the best estimate of efficacy of BDP as a benchmark for evaluation of newer asthma therapies.</P>

<CRIT_STUDIES>
<P>
<BR/>Studies were selected for this review if they were randomised double, single or unblinded controlled studies. We made an amendment to the entry criteria for this review. One reviewer felt that study design was an important factor in affecting the validity of pooled effect estimates from individual studies. In view of the uncertainty surrounding the influence of carryover effects in studies of crossover design, whereby effect estimates may be affected by an inadequate washout phase, we have retained crossover studies previously included, but switched off pooled totals. We restricted the inclusion of new studies to those with a parallel group design. </P>
<P/>
</CRIT_STUDIES>
<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>We included studies recruiting children and adults. To be eligible participants had to have a clinical diagnosis of chronic asthma. We included trials in which the diagnosis was based upon physician opinion only, as well as those in which further clinical, physiological and/or immunological features in keeping with asthma were stated as inclusion criteria. Only patients over the age of two years were included. We included studies involving patients with both asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) provided that the data for asthmatic patients were available separately. We considered studies conducted in a primary care, hospital outpatient and institutional care setting.</P>
</CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>BDP delivered by mouth inhalation versus placebo. Any dose of beclomethasone was considered, but nominal daily dose had to be stated. Nominal daily dose is calculated as valve dose (UK, Europe) or the actuator dose (USA) multiplied by the number of actuations per day. In the initial version of the review treatment needed to be for at least one week. Subsequent to the initial version of this review, one reviewer felt that studies of too short a duration would not provide accurate effect estimates. Findings from a recent individual prospective controlled trial comparing BDP at different doses were that the peak effect for a number of outcome measures had plateaued after around six weeks (<LINK REF="REF-Busse-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Busse 1999</LINK>). For the update of this review, discussions between the reviewers led to a compromise on excluding data from studies of shorter than 4 weeks duration. We would only prospectively include studies that were of at least 4 weeks duration. However, we have retained studies of less than four weeks previously 'included' in the review, but we have removed the data that they contribute from pooled analyses.<B> </B>Delivery could be by pressurised metered dose inhaler (MDI) with or without holding chamber/spacer, breath-actuated MDI or dry powder inhaler (DPI). Any co-intervention was acceptable, including the use of oral corticosteroids. We excluded studies concerned with treatment delivered by nebuliser. Since this review was first published there has been considerable research and development concerning CFC-free pMDI formulations. We have opted not to pool studies in which different propellants were used. For the purposes of continuity and to avoid potentially heterogeneous findings, this review will consider HFA-BDP and CFC-BDP separately when compared with placebo.<B> </B>Equivalence between CFC and HFA preparations will not be considered in this review.</P>

<STUDY_SELECTION MODIFIED="2008-07-21 14:12:19 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>The decision to exclude studies prior to full paper retrieval was made by one author (NPA). The full text papers retrieved were reviewed independently by two authors (NPA and JB). Disagreement as to which papers to include was resolved by consensus. The reviewers who were blinded to the authors names, institution and funding sources, independently assessed the methodological quality of each study. Abstracts from the new search were read and selected for retrieval by the reviewers independently. Trials thought to be eligible for inclusion were retrieved and any disagreements were resolved by discussion in order to arrive at the final list of included studies.</P>
</STUDY_SELECTION>
<DATA_EXTRACTION MODIFIED="2008-07-21 14:14:26 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>One reviewer (NPA) extracted data for each outcome from the published results of included trials. In the case of continuous outcomes such as spirometry:<BR/>(1) Where outcomes were evaluated at a number of time points, we only used data from the last time point.<BR/>(2) We extracted data from graphical plots when presented in this form; attempt was made to verify such data by contacting authors.<BR/>(3) If an intention-to-treat analysis (ITT) was not used by the investigators, and it was not explicit in the presentation of results how many subjects (N) were in each group at the time of last evaluation of that outcome, we calculated the appropriate N value for each intervention group by subtracting the number of patients who withdrew in each intervention group from those randomised to each intervention group.</P>
<P>It should be noted that in the graphical displays of this review continuous outcome data such as spirometry and PEFR are displayed using negative figures because the sign convention built into the software interprets smaller numbers as favourable (as is usually the case for dichotomous outcomes such as withdrawal rates). This ensures that results favouring BDP are consistently displayed to the left of the vertical line on the graphical meta-analysis display.<BR/>
<BR/>We contacted authors (by mail, fax and/or electronic mail) on at least two occasions to clarify details of randomisation and/or request missing outcome data. An attempt was made to send requests to correct current addresses by searching MEDLINE, EMBASE and hospital World Wide Web (WWW) sites for up-to-date contact details. We approached Glaxo Wellcome for data for those trials in which the contact authors did not initially reply or when authors suggested doing so and which had been sponsored by the company.</P>
<P>Data for outcomes reported but which could not be included in the meta-analysis have been listed in <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>.</P>
<P>Assessment of asthma severity is a problematic area. The biological mechanisms of disease are incompletely understood and no molecular or genetic markers of disease severity have been identified. At the current time, severity can only be defined in terms of either (a) the frequency of symptoms, exacerbations and/or the degree of reduction in airway calibre, or (b) the amount of medication required to maintain a given level of control. For the purposes of this review we had originally planned to classify studies according to baseline FEV1 (% predicted) alone. However, we found this measurement was reported inconsistently. An attempt was therefore made to classify asthma severity using current criteria (<LINK REF="REF-GINA-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">GINA 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NHLBI-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">NHLBI 1997</LINK>). This classification of severity is based upon FEV1 (% predicted), frequency of symptoms and exacerbations and diurnal PEFR variability. Four grades of severity are defined: severe, moderate, mild persistent and mild intermittent. However, this classification only applies to untreated patients. The guidelines also recommend a range of daily doses of ICS for disease at each severity grade. For example, BUD 200 to 400 mcg/d for mild persistent disease, 400 to 600 mcg/d for moderate disease, &gt; 600 mcg/d for severe disease in adult patients. Therefore in the case of studies in which patients were using an ICS at the time of enrolment, we attempted to classify severity according to baseline ICS use using these ranges.</P>

<EFFECT_MEASURES MODIFIED="2008-07-21 14:13:55 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>For each outcome for continuous data the mean, the standard deviation, and the number of the patients were required for each assessment. For binary data, such as clinical improvement or no clinical improvement, the relative risk was used to express the treatment effect. For this type of data the number in each group and the numbers experiencing the outcome were sought. Where the mean and standard deviation were not reported for each treatment group they were extracted if available. Data prior the randomisation phase were not used to assess safety or efficacy.</P>
</EFFECT_MEASURES>
<DATA_SYNTHESIS MODIFIED="2008-07-21 14:13:12 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>We calculated a weighted treatment effect across trials using the Cochrane statistical package RevMan Analyses 4.2.6. For continuous outcomes, we calculated a weighted mean difference (WMD) or standardised mean difference (SMD) as appropriate. For binary/dichotomous outcomes, we calculated a relative risk (RR). We assessed heterogeneity with the I-square statistic as described in <LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2003</LINK>. We used a fixed effect model when homogenous treatment effects were present (I square 0%). We applied a Random Effects model when heterogeneity was present (I square &gt;0%), but we have reported the results of Random Effects modelling where this has resulted in a significant pooled effect estimate becoming non-significant, or where I square is greater than 25%. We expressed pooled treatments effects with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI).</P>
<P>A number of <I>a priori</I> conditions were established regarding the comparisons made:</P>
<P>(1) Studies were distinguished as those in which patients were (a) not treated with regular oral steroids (OCS), (b) dependent upon regular OCS prior to study. It was recognised a priori that trials assessing the efficacy of ICS in OCS dependent patients may have an 'oral steroid down-titration' design. In other words they may use reduction in OCS use as an outcome measure, whilst attempting to maintain asthma control. On the other hand studies recruiting non-OCS treated asthmatics are more likely to have a design aimed at detecting improvements in asthma control. It was inappropriate to combine trials with these different designs and objectives.</P>
<P>(2) It was anticipated that measures of bronchial hyper-responsiveness (PD20 FEV<SUB>1</SUB>, PC20 FEV<SUB>1</SUB>) would often be reported as geometric means. Presentation of results in this way indicates that data has been logarithmically transformed prior to analysis by investigators to take account of a skewed distribution. Data for such outcomes was only pooled across studies where the mean and standard deviation of logged values (from which geometric means are derived) could be calculated.</P>
<P>(3) Data from studies that employed pMDI using a CFC propellant were not pooled with those using an HFA propellant. The similarity or otherwise of effects between these two preparations has not been sufficiently established, and there is some evidence from a large prospective study that a dose of 400mcg/d of HFA-BDP may be equivalent to 800mcg/d of CFC-BDP (<LINK REF="STD-Gross-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Gross 1999</LINK>). Although the dose response may be more pronounced at lower doses of HFA-BDP than at equivalent increments in CFC, we have opted to pool studies assessing the effects of HFA-BDP in the same categories, performing subgroup analyses where possible. This review is not primarily concerned with dose response, except as a possible explanation of heterogeneity, as we are focusing on efficacy in the first instance.</P>

<BR/>In fifteen studies (<LINK REF="STD-BTTA-1976" TYPE="STUDY">BTTA 1976</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Brompton_x002f_MRC-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Brompton/MRC 1974</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cameron-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Cameron 1973</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Davies-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Davies 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Harvey-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Harvey 1976</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hodson-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Hodson 1974</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kerigan-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Kerigan 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lacronique-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Lacronique 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Webb-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Webb 1977</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Hampel-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Hampel 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hoshino-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Hoshino 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Laviolette-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Laviolette 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Malmstrom-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Malmstrom 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nathan-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Nathan 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nayak-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Nayak 2002</LINK>) the dependence on treatment with regular oral prednisolone for asthma control was an inclusion criterion. In three studies a proportion of enrolled participants were receiving oral steroid treatment but this was not an inclusion criterion. No attempt was made to reduce daily prednisolone dose in these studies. In one study (<LINK REF="STD-Kerrebijn-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Kerrebijn 1976</LINK>) a proportion of participants were receiving oral steroids at enrolment and attempt was made to withdraw oral prednisolone in these participants.</P>
<P>Treatment with oral corticosteroids at the time of enrolment was an exclusion criterion for all included studies except <LINK REF="STD-Gross-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Gross 1999</LINK>. In this study a seven to 12 day course of oral steroid treatment (prednisolone 30 mg/d) was followed during the run in period and prior to randomisation. In one study (<LINK REF="STD-Malmstrom-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Malmstrom 1999</LINK>) oral steroids were permitted for asthma exacerbation episodes but patients who suffered from more than two episodes were withdrawn. In contrast, maintenance treatment with an inhaled corticosteroid prior to the screening visit was an entry criterion in four trials (<LINK REF="STD-Bernstein-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Bernstein 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Laviolette-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Laviolette 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nathan-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Nathan 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gross-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Gross 1999</LINK>). In two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Bernstein-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Bernstein 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nathan-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Nathan 2001</LINK>) patients must have been on a stable daily dose of inhaled corticosterioid prior the run-in period for two and four weeks respectively.</P>

<B>DIAGNOSIS OF ASTHMA</B>
<BR/>In 16 studies (28%) there was no clear indication of the criteria upon which a diagnosis of asthma was made and appears to have been at the discretion of the investigator. All except one of these (<LINK REF="STD-Katsunuma-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Katsunuma 1993</LINK>) were published in or prior to 1976. In seven studies a diagnosis of asthma was made of the basis of American Thoracic Society criteria, either by 1962 standards (<LINK REF="STD-Boner-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Boner 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fanelli-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Fanelli 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Salmeron-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Salmeron 1989</LINK>) or 1987 standards (<LINK REF="STD-Kerstjens-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Kerstjens 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lacronique-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Lacronique 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Laviolette-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Laviolette 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hoshino-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Hoshino 1998</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Hoshino-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Hoshino 2001</LINK>). In two studies, (<LINK REF="STD-Matthys-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Matthys 1998</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Hampel-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Hampel 2000</LINK>) diagnosis was made on the basis of current GINA standards. In 14 studies, diagnosis was supported by either demonstrable variability of FEV1 or PEFR over time, or reversibility following inhalation of beta2 agonist. In five studies, diagnosis was supported by the demonstration of bronchial hyper-responsiveness to histamine (<LINK REF="STD-Trigg-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Trigg 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wang-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 1994</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Wiebicke-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Wiebicke 1990</LINK>), methacholine (<LINK REF="STD-Fahy-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Fahy 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wiebicke-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Wiebicke 1990</LINK>) or propranolol (<LINK REF="STD-Carpentiere-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Carpentiere 1990</LINK>). In three studies the diagnosis was supported by intermittent symptoms of wheeze and/or cough and breathlessness with bronchial hyper-responsiveness (BHR) to methacholine (<LINK REF="STD-Bel-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Bel 1990</LINK>) or histamine (<LINK REF="STD-Chan-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Chan 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pennings-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Pennings 1997</LINK>). In one study a diagnosis of seasonal asthma was made on the basis of positive skin prick tests for Parietaria with a recognised seasonal increase in asthma symptoms (<LINK REF="STD-Vatrella-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Vatrella 1996</LINK>). In two studies a diagnosis of occupational asthma was made on the basis of hyper-responsiveness to occupational allergens (<LINK REF="STD-De-Marzo-1988" TYPE="STUDY">De Marzo 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Maestrelli-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Maestrelli 1993</LINK>). Skin-prick test was performed in two papers (<LINK REF="STD-Hoshino-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Hoshino 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nathan-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Nathan 2001</LINK>), and tested different allergens.</P>
<P>
<B>SEVERITY OF ASTHMA: STUDIES RECRUITING NON-OCS TREATED PATIENTS</B>
<BR/>(1)MILD<BR/>In six studies, investigators stated that the severity of asthma was mild. A baseline FEV1 &gt; 60 % predicted was an inclusion criterion in two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Wang-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Trigg-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Trigg 1994</LINK>); FEV1 &gt; 80% in one study (<LINK REF="STD-Vatrella-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Vatrella 1996</LINK>); &gt; 90% one study (<LINK REF="STD-Pennings-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Pennings 1997</LINK>). No information was given regarding the baseline frequency of asthma symptoms in these studies.</P>
<P>In a further three studies the authors did not give an opinion as to the severity of disease in the participants recruited, or provide information on the frequency of asthma symptoms in subjects at enrolment. However, baseline FEV1 was &gt; 70 % predicted (<LINK REF="STD-Boner-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Boner 1991</LINK>), &gt; 75% (<LINK REF="STD-Maestrelli-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Maestrelli 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vatrella-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Vatrella 1996</LINK>). In one study (<LINK REF="STD-Fanelli-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Fanelli 1993</LINK>) subjects were enrolled who had baseline FEV1 &gt; 90 (% predicted) and who were asymptomatic.</P>
<P>In all of these studies participants were not receiving a regular inhaled steroid at the time of enrolment.</P>
<P>(2) MILD TO MODERATE<BR/>In nine studies, investigators classed the severity of asthma of enrolled participants as mild to moderate. In one study (<LINK REF="STD-Simons-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Simons 1997</LINK>) an inclusion criterion was a baseline FEV1 &gt; 70 (% predicted). In the remaining eight studies (<LINK REF="STD-Berkowitz-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Berkowitz 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bronsky-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Bronsky 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fahy-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Fahy 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hoshino-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Hoshino 1998</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Malmstrom-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Malmstrom 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Laviolette-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Laviolette 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bernstein-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Bernstein 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hampel-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Hampel 2000</LINK>), participants were recruited with baseline FEV1 of between 50 and 90 (% predicted). In one further study (<LINK REF="STD-Bel-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Bel 1990</LINK>), investigators did not give an opinion as to the severity of disease, however the range of baseline FEV1 was 54 to 123 (% predicted) suggests participants in this trial had mild to moderate asthma.</P>
<P>Requirement for BDP 336 mcg/d for asthma control was an inclusion criterion for two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Berkowitz-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Berkowitz 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bronsky-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Bronsky 1998</LINK>). In all other studies participants were not receiving a regular inhaled steroid at the time of enrolment.</P>
<P>(3) MODERATELY SEVERE<BR/>In five studies, asthma severity was classed as moderate by the investigators. In <LINK REF="STD-Nathan-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Nathan 1997</LINK>, baseline FEV1 was between 50 and 80 (% predicted). In the study by <LINK REF="STD-Matthys-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Matthys 1998</LINK>, participants fulfilled the criteria for moderate severity asthma according to the <LINK REF="REF-GINA-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">GINA 1995</LINK> criteria. In <LINK REF="STD-Salmeron-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Salmeron 1989</LINK>, the mean FEV1 of participants at baseline was 50 (% predicted), and it was stated that symptoms were poorly controlled at baseline. In two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Gaddie-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Gaddie 1973</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Messerli-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Messerli 1975</LINK>), there was no indication of baseline spirometry or frequency of symptoms.</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Nathan-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Nathan 1997</LINK> participants were receiving a regular inhaled steroid at the time of enrolment.</P>
<P>In two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Nathan-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Nathan 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nayak-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Nayak 2002</LINK>), investigators ranked the severity of asthma as moderate. In <LINK REF="STD-Nathan-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Nathan 2001</LINK>, the baseline FEV1 value was between 60 and 90 (% predicted). The mean value recorded for baseline FEV1 in <LINK REF="STD-Nayak-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Nayak 2002</LINK> was 71.70 (% predicted).</P>
<P>(4) MODERATE TO SEVERE<BR/>In <LINK REF="STD-Vogt-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Vogt 1976</LINK>, investigators considered participants to have moderate to severe asthma. Baseline FEV1 ranged from 20 to 80 (% predicted). No indication was given as to frequency of asthma symptoms. In <LINK REF="STD-Radha-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Radha 1975</LINK>, the investigators did not give an opinion as to the severity asthma of participants in the trial, however baseline FEV1 ranged from 35 to 75 (% predicted). In <LINK REF="STD-Gross-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Gross 1999</LINK>, the global Initiative for asthma classification was used, and participants with at least moderate severity asthma were enrolled.</P>
<P>(5) SEVERE<BR/>In one study (<LINK REF="STD-Klein-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Klein 1977</LINK>), the investigators considered their patients to have severe asthma, but no information was given as to baseline spirometry or symptom frequency. In one study (<LINK REF="STD-Lovera-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Lovera 1975</LINK>) the investigators considered their patients to have asthma severe enough to warrant consideration of treatment with oral steroids but again no information was given as to baseline spirometry or symptom frequency</P>
<P>(6) MILD TO SEVERE<BR/>In two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Bergmann-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Bergmann 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kerstjens-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Kerstjens 1994</LINK>), participants were recruited with a spectrum of disease severity, from mild to severe. Baseline FEV1 ranged between 10 and 120 (% predicted).</P>
<P>(7) NO CLEAR INDICATION OF SEVERITY<BR/>In three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Bennati-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Bennati 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fournier-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Fournier 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kraemer-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Kraemer 1987</LINK>) the investigators did not give an opinion as to the severity of asthma of participants.

</P>
<P>
<B>DAILY DOSE OF CFC-BDP</B>
<BR/>32 studies assessed the effects of a daily nominal dose of BDP of 400 mcg or less versus placebo. Nine studies (21%) assessed the effects of 500 to 800 mcg/d of BDP, whilst 16 (28%) assessed the effects of 1000 mcg/d or greater. Four studies (<LINK REF="STD-Brompton_x002f_MRC-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Brompton/MRC 1974</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-BTTA-1976" TYPE="STUDY">BTTA 1976</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kerrebijn-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Kerrebijn 1976</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nathan-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Nathan 1997</LINK>) included a comparison of two or more doses of beclomethasone to placebo within the same study.</P>
<P>Seven studies (<LINK REF="STD-Bel-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Bel 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kraemer-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Kraemer 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Simons-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Simons 1997</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Bernstein-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Bernstein 1999</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Gross-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Gross 1999</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Laviolette-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Laviolette 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Malmstrom-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Malmstrom 1999</LINK>), included a treatment arm of nedocromil, sodium cromoglycate, salmeterol, montelukast, theophylline, mometasone furate and HFA-BDP respectively. These treatment arms were not considered in this review</P>
<P>Three studies included a group of participants treated with additional inhaled corticosteroid. Two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Berkowitz-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Berkowitz 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bronsky-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Bronsky 1998</LINK>) included a triamcinolone acetonide treated group and one (<LINK REF="STD-BTTA-1976" TYPE="STUDY">BTTA 1976</LINK>) included a group treated with betamethasone valerate. These interventions have not been evaluated in this review.</P>
<P>
<B>DAILY DOSE OF HFA-BDP</B>
<BR/>Three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Gross-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Gross 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hampel-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Hampel 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nayak-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Nayak 2002</LINK>), evaluated the effect of HFA-BDP versus placebo. In Hampel 2000, two different doses of BDP-HFA (100 mcg/day, 200 mcg/day) were compared to placebo. In <LINK REF="STD-Nayak-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Nayak 2002</LINK>, a daily dose of 80 mcg/day and 160/day mcg versus placebo were tested in asthmatic children. The comparable efficacy of 400 HFA-BDP mcg/day and 800 mcg/day BDP-CFC was assessed in one study and compared to placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Gross-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Gross 1999</LINK>). The two propellants were not compared directly in this review, but will be the subject of a separate review (<LINK REF="REF-Malouf-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Malouf 2004</LINK>).

<BR/>
<B>DELIVERY DEVICE</B>
<BR/>33 studies used a pMDI to deliver study medication. Two studies used a MDI with spacer device. In two studies the Diskhaler (<LINK REF="STD-Simons-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Simons 1997</LINK>) and the Rotahaler (<LINK REF="STD-Kraemer-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Kraemer 1987</LINK>) were used. Aerochamber Spacer device was used in one study, (<LINK REF="STD-Malmstrom-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Malmstrom 1999</LINK>). In a single study, (<LINK REF="STD-Nayak-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Nayak 2002</LINK>) undertaken in children the Autohaler breath-actuated device was employed. Beclomethasone and placebo was delivered using the same device in all conducted studies except in (<LINK REF="STD-Nathan-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Nathan 2001</LINK>), where DPI was used to deliver placebo.</P>
<P>
<B>LENGTH OF INTERVENTION PERIOD</B>
<BR/>Four studies used a treatment period of four weeks. 30 studies had a treatment period between one to six months. Six studies had a treatment period of six months or longer. Two studies (<LINK REF="STD-BTTA-1976" TYPE="STUDY">BTTA 1976</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cameron-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Cameron 1973</LINK>) used an intervention period of variable length.<BR/>
<B>
<BR/>OUTCOMES ASSESSED</B>
<BR/>A large number of outcome measures were reported, often using different metrics of measurement. All outcomes were considered except the following:<BR/>
<BR/>(1) A number of studies included outcomes related directly to the biological basis of airway inflammation in asthma. These included inflammatory cell profiles in bronchial epithelium (<LINK REF="STD-Hoshino-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Hoshino 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wang-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 1994</LINK>), bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (<LINK REF="STD-Trigg-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Trigg 1994</LINK>) and induced sputum (<LINK REF="STD-Fahy-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Fahy 1998</LINK>). The expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (<LINK REF="STD-Trigg-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Trigg 1994</LINK>) and bronchial wall epithelium (<LINK REF="STD-Hoshino-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Hoshino 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wang-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 1994</LINK>) has also been assessed. In <LINK REF="STD-Hoshino-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Hoshino 2001</LINK> changes in airway mucosal vascularity were estimated. These outcomes involve invasive or semi-invasive tissue/fluid sampling and are not generally regarded as useful outcome measures to assess the clinical efficacy of ICS in asthma. These outcomes have not been considered in this review.</P>
<P>(2) A number of studies examined detailed lung mechanics in response to bronchial inhalation challenge. One study (<LINK REF="STD-Fanelli-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Fanelli 1993</LINK>) assessed minute ventilation, tidal volume, respiratory frequency, inspiratory and expiratory time and mean inspiratory flow rates following inhaled histamine challenge. A further study (<LINK REF="STD-Pennings-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Pennings 1997</LINK>) assessed the change in various parameters related to airway impedance and reactance following isocapnic cold air bronchial challenge measured by a forced oscillation technique. At the current time these outcome measures are not widely used, and because of the uncertainty as to their value in guiding clinical practice they have not been included in this review.</P>
<P>All other efficacy and safety outcomes were considered. A significant amount of outcome data could not be included in the meta-analysis, usually because standard deviation values for means were not reported. This is listed in <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>.</P>

<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS MODIFIED="2008-07-21 14:16:53 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>Results from the meta-analysis are reported by outcome. All comparisons concern BDP versus placebo.</P>
<P>This complex review required a structured approach to reporting the results, therefore a hierarchy of result reporting was established:</P>
<P>(A) Study medication: CFC-BDP or HFA-BDP<BR/>(B) Background therapy: with or without oral corticosteroids (OCS)<BR/>(C) Outcome measurement unit: FEV1, PEFR etc.<BR/>(D) Unit of measurement: i.e. absolute, % predicted or change compared to baseline<BR/>
<BR/>Within each component subgroup analysis by age group, BDP daily dose, asthma severity, delivery device, length of intervention period and study quality are reported, where the data permit. This was structured in the following way:</P>
<P>(a) Comparisons 1 to 3 consider each outcome according to CFC-BDP dose (400 mcg/d or less, 500 to 800 mcg/d, 1000 mcg/d or greater). The results for these comparisons are discussed in the text of the results first for each outcome.<BR/>
<B>
<BR/>
</B>(b) Comparisons 12 to 14 consider each outcome according to HFA-BDP dose (100 mcg/day or less, 160-200 mcg/day and 400 mcg/day).</P>
<P>(c) Studies were pooled, irrespective of CFC-BDP or HFA-BDP dose. This allowed an overall effect size to be calculated for each outcome. It also permitted an exploration of whether the effect size varied in a consistent manner according to dose. Because studies were divided into subgroups according to daily dose, it allowed an impression to be gained of any dose response relationship by comparing the 95% confidence intervals around the mean effect size for each dose subgroup. These results are also discussed in the text.</P>
<P>(d) The findings of subgroup analyses based on delivery device, study duration and asthma severity are reported (Comparisons 4 to 7).</P>
<P>Comparisons of CFC-BDP and HFA-BDP versus placebo were analysed separately. They were also stratified on the basis of duration: i) data at four weeks and ii) data at greater than four weeks depending on the duration of follow-up in the studies. In all outcomes the overall estimate from a Fixed Effect model was presented and a test for heterogeneity using a standard chi-square was performed. Where there was evidence of heterogeneity of treatment effect between trials Random Effects (RE) modelling was applied and we report differences between the two models.</P>

<BR/>No significant heterogeneity was found for any of these comparisons. A sensitivity analysis based on methodological quality was undertaken. Two studies with Jadad scores of two were excluded from the analyses (<LINK REF="STD-Fanelli-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Fanelli 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Radha-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Radha 1975</LINK>), however this did not significantly alter the direction or size of effect.</P>
<P>
<B>(b) FEV1 (Litres/min)</B>:<BR/>Data from six studies were available (<LINK REF="STD-Fahy-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Fahy 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bronsky-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Bronsky 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vogt-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Vogt 1976</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gross-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Gross 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pennings-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Pennings 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Salmeron-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Salmeron 1989</LINK>). Within each steroid dose range, there was a significant effect in favour of CFC-BDP compared with placebo (&lt;400: 0.34 litres (95% CI 0.11 to 0.56); 5-800: 0.33 (95% CI 0.14 to 0.52); greater than 800: 0.48 (95% CI 0.15 to 0.82)). When pooled across these doses, there was a significant effect in favour of BDP of 0.36 litres (95% CI 0.22 to 0.49). No significant heterogeneity was observed within each dose group, or across the six studies when they were pooled.</P>
<P>
<B>(c) Change in FEV1 (Litres): </B>
<BR/>There was a significant difference in change from baseline in favour of BDP of 0.36 litres (95% CI 0.20 to 0.53 litres). The 95% confidence intervals for each dose subgroup overlapped widely and there was no significant difference between the results from trials of more or less than 4 weeks duration. Additional subgroup analyses based on delivery device and asthma severity did not identify any particular group of studies showing a greater benefit.</P>
<P>
<B>(d) FEV1 (% predicted):<BR/>
</B>There was no significant difference between BDP and placebo: WMD: 5.36% (95% CI -0.88 to 11.60%). There was significant heterogeneity between studies (I square 61.3%). A sensitivity analysis based on methodological quality resulted in the removal of one low quality study (<LINK REF="STD-Fanelli-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Fanelli 1993</LINK>) but did not reduce the heterogeneity. The subgroup analysis based upon asthma severity resulted in the exclusion of <LINK REF="STD-Kerstjens-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Kerstjens 1994</LINK>, because participants with a very wide range of asthma severity from mild to severe were recruited. Although heterogeneity resolved completely, the effect remained non-significant (WMD 1.88% (95% CI -2.11 to 5.8%)). It would appear that the <LINK REF="STD-Kerstjens-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Kerstjens 1994</LINK>study contributes significantly to the overall treatment effect (which disappears when we removed the study) but also to the level heterogeneity, although the reasons for this are not clear. <B>
<BR/>
</B>
<BR/>
<B>(e) Change in FEV1 (%): </B>
<BR/>Two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Malmstrom-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Malmstrom 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Laviolette-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Laviolette 1999</LINK>), reported the changes in FEV1% from baseline. The difference in FEV1% between active treatment groups and placebo was significant (WMD 12.41% (95%CI 8.18 to 16.64)). A small study (<LINK REF="STD-Trigg-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Trigg 1994</LINK>), (25 participants) assessing BDP 1000 mcg/d versus placebo did not show any difference between treatment groups.<BR/>
<B>
<BR/>(f) FVC (Litres)</B>
<BR/>Two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Radha-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Radha 1975</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vogt-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Vogt 1976</LINK>), assessing BDP 400 and 800 mcg/d versus placebo, respectively. No significant difference between treatment groups was apparent. <LINK REF="STD-Radha-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Radha 1975</LINK>, comprised only 28 participants and was of weak methodological quality (Jadad score 2). One low quality (Jadad score 2) study (<LINK REF="STD-Fanelli-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Fanelli 1993</LINK>) evaluating BDP 2000 mcg/d versus placebo reported FVC, no significant difference between treatment groups was apparent.</P>
<P>A single study (<LINK REF="STD-Nathan-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Nathan 2001</LINK>) reported changes in FVC compared to baseline. There was a significant improvement in favour of BDP 400 mcg/d compared with PLA (CFC-BDP 0.17, SD 0.45 compared with placebo -0.22 SD 0.45).<B>

<BR/>
<B>(g) Expiratory flow at low lung volume (FEF 25% to 75% of FEV1)</B>
<BR/>Two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Fahy-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Fahy 1998</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Vogt-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Vogt 1976</LINK>), assessed FEF 25% to 75% of FEV1. There was a significant effect improvement in this measure in favour of BDP at doses of 400 and 800 mcg/d versus placebo, WMD 0.93 L/second (95% CI 0.58 to 1.28). A subgroup analysis based on treatment duration did not reveal any differences between groups. It is noteworthy that these two studies had treatment periods of four weeks only.</P>
<P>
<B>(h) Change in FEF 25% to 75% FEV1 compared with baseline</B>
<BR/>One study which assessed BDP at a daily dose of 400mcg (<LINK REF="STD-Nathan-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Nathan 2001</LINK>) reported change in FEF 25-75% FEV1 from baseline. A significant effect was seen in favour of BDP over placebo (0.08, SD 0.60 compared with -0.22, SD 0.60) L/second.</P>
<P>
<B>(2) Peak expiratory flow (PEF)</B>
<BR/>
<BR/>
<B>(a) Morning PEF (L/MIN)</B>
<BR/>Two studies undertaken in adults, presented data for home diary card recorded morning PEFR in a form suitable for meta-analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Fahy-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Fahy 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kerstjens-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Kerstjens 1994</LINK>). No significant treatment advantage of BDP over placebo was demonstrated for individual doses. When studies were pooled across dose and duration, no significant overall effect in favour of BDP was evident.<BR/>
<BR/>
<B>(b) Change in morning PEF compared with baseline (L/MIN)<BR/>
</B>Four studies (<LINK REF="STD-Gross-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Gross 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Matthys-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Matthys 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Malmstrom-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Malmstrom 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nathan-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Nathan 2001</LINK>), provided data for the change in PEFR compared with baseline. A pooled estimate was derived for two dose categories (&lt;400mcg/d and 500-800mcg/d). When data from these two dose categories were pooled there was a significant effect in favour of CFC-BDP of 39.05 L/min (95% CI 31.95 to 46.15). There was a very low level of heterogeneity (Chi2 3.5, df: 3; I2 14%). <BR/>
<B>
<BR/>(c) Evening PEF (L/min)</B>
<BR/>Two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Kerstjens-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Kerstjens 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Malmstrom-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Malmstrom 1999</LINK>), presented diary card evening PEFR data in a form suitable for analysis. Both assessed adult subjects. <LINK REF="STD-Kerstjens-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Kerstjens 1994</LINK>, compared BDP 800 mcg/d versus placebo, no difference between treatment groups was found. <LINK REF="STD-Malmstrom-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Malmstrom 1999</LINK>, reported the changes of evening PEFR from baseline. This study tested the efficacy of BDP 400 mcg/day versus placebo. The data presented a significant benefit of BDP over placebo, (32.10 L/min, SD 63.45 compared with 0.30 L/min SD 62.52). Subgroup analyses based upon delivery device, study duration and asthma severity were undertaken for diary card morning and evening PEFR but did not identify any groups who appeared to preferentially benefit from treatment with BDP.</P>
<P>
<B>(c) PEF: other measures</B>
<BR/>One study (<LINK REF="STD-Hoshino-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Hoshino 1998</LINK>) reported diary card daily average PEFR. No difference between BDP 800 mcg/d and placebo treatment groups was seen. However, this study did demonstrate a significant effect in favour of BDP for diurnal variability in PEFR, mean difference 11% (95% CI 5 to 18%).</P>
<P>
<B>(2) RESCUE BETA2 AGONIST USE</B>
</P>
<P>
<B>(a) Absolute rescue beta2 agonist use </B>
<BR/>Daily rescue beta2 agonist use was reported with data suitable for analysis in three studies, all of which were in adults (<LINK REF="STD-Hoshino-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Hoshino 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Matthys-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Matthys 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vatrella-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Vatrella 1996</LINK>). There was significantly lower beta2 agonist use for low dose BDP compared to placebo: WMD 0.9 puffs/d (95% CI 0.4 to 1.2). One study assessed BDP 800 mcg/d versus placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Hoshino-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Hoshino 1998</LINK>) that was undertaken in 171 asthmatic adults and demonstrated significantly lower beta2 agonist use for BDP, mean difference -1.80 puffs/d (95%CI -2.21 to -1.38). One study (<LINK REF="STD-Vatrella-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Vatrella 1996</LINK>) with a small sample size of 20 asthmatics assessed BDP 1000 mcg/d versus placebo and showed significantly lower beta2 agonist use in the BDP treated group, WMD -2.9 puffs/d (95% CI -3.5 to -2.4).</P>
<P>When studies were pooled across all doses, an overall effect in favour of BDP was apparent: WMD -1.98 puffs/d (95% CI -2.34 to -1.62). There was a high degree of heterogeneity when studies were pooled (I square 94%) and therefore a Random Effect model was applied. The resultant pooled effect estimate remained significant (-2.39 puffs/d (95% CI -4.02 to -0.75). The 95% confidence intervals for the pooled treatment effect for medium (500-800 mcg/d) and high dose BDP (1000 mcg/d or greater) did not overlap those of low dose (400 mcg/d or less) BDP, giving the impression of a dose response effect. However this observation needs to be viewed with caution since it is based on only three studies with relatively small numbers of participants in the medium and higher dose range (38/294 participants overall) and is not a randomised comparison. Subgroup analyses based on delivery device, study duration and asthma severity could not account for the heterogeneity.</P>
<P>
<B>(b) Change in rescue beta2 agonist use<BR/>
</B>Three studies from different dose ranges (400mcg/d and 500-800mcg/d) reported data on change in rescue medication usage (400mcg/d: <LINK REF="STD-Malmstrom-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Malmstrom 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nathan-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Nathan 2001</LINK>; 500-800 mcg/d: <LINK REF="STD-Gross-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Gross 1999</LINK>). There was a significant reduction in daily beta agonist use at a dose of 400 mcg/d of -2.32 puffs/d (95% CI -2.55 to -2.09). When pooled with the <LINK REF="STD-Gross-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Gross 1999</LINK>study there was a significant degree of heterogeneity (72.9%). This may be both a reflection of the pre-dosing OCS schedule, and the higher dose of CFC-BDP given to participants in <LINK REF="STD-Gross-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Gross 1999</LINK>. However, the pooled effect estimate for the subgroups was significantly in favour of CFC-BDP with both Fixed Effect and Random Effects modelling: FE: -2.18 puffs/day (95% CI -2.38 to -1.97); RE: -2.07 puffs/day (95% CI -2.60 to -1.54).<BR/>
<BR/>
<B>(3) ASTHMA SYMPTOMS<BR/>
</B>
<BR/>
<B>(a) Absolute symptom scores </B>
<BR/>The reporting of symptom scores was disparate and the pooled estimates and we have analysed data as SMDs due to the different scales employed. Two small studies reported symptom scores as absolute values (<LINK REF="STD-Hoshino-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Hoshino 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vatrella-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Vatrella 1996</LINK>), and when pooled there was significant difference of -2.81 standard deviations (95% CI -3.77 to -1.86).</P>
<P>
<B>(b) Change in symptom scores</B>
<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Kerstjens-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Kerstjens 1994</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Malmstrom-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Malmstrom 1999</LINK> reported change in asthma symptom score from baseline. When pooled, BDP led to a significant improvement compared to placebo of SMD 0.19 (95%CI 0.35 to 0.03). However, there was a high level of heterogeneity (I square 72%) which is difficult to interpret given the number of studies and the differences in their characteristics (including sample size, sensitivity of symptom scale used and dose of BDP used in the studies). Further studies would elucidate whether the differences in symptoms are related to the characteristics of the studies described above, or whether additional factors may contribute to different responses such as baseline symptoms.<BR/>
<BR/>
<B>(4) BRONCHIAL HYPER-RESPONSIVENESS (BHR)</B>
<BR/>BHR to a number of pharmacological stimuli was assessed. Five studies reported data on methacholine challenge. When studies were pooled across all doses an overall effect in favour of treatment with BDP was apparent (SMD: 0.53 (95% CI 0.10 to 0.96)). We performed a subgroup analysis based on duration of treatment. The single study that assessed treatment over a period of four weeks did not demonstrate a significant difference in methacholine BHR between active treatment and placebo groups. However, there was a significantly lower methacholine BHR in the BDP treatment group when the three studies with treatment periods of greater than four weeks were pooled SMD 0.53 (95% CI 0.10 to 0.96). This lends some support to the notion that duration of treatment may be a significant factor modulating the treatment effect of BDP. However, this must be viewed with caution due to the small number of studies and participants included in this analysis. No trend in keeping with a dose response effect was present. Subgroup analyses based upon BDP dose, delivery device, and asthma severity did not identify any groups that appeared to benefit preferentially.</P>
<P>Histamine PC20 FEV1 was significantly greater in BDP 800 mcg/d treated participants compared to placebo in the single study in adults (<LINK REF="STD-Kerstjens-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Kerstjens 1994</LINK>), that reported this outcome: mean difference log 10 values 1.19 (95% CI 0.66 to 1.71).</P>
<P>One study (<LINK REF="STD-Pennings-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Pennings 1997</LINK>), assessed high dose BDP (1000 mcg/d or greater) used other provoking stimuli. This study evaluated BHR to inhalational cold air challenge (IHCA), assessed by post challenge FEV1 (litres). There was no significant difference between treatment groups. It should be noted however, that within the same study, BHR to IHCA as measured using a forced oscillation technique found a statistically significant improvement in the BDP treated participants compared to placebo (data not shown).</P>
<P>
<B>(5) ASTHMA EXACERBATIONS<BR/>
</B>No studies reported hospital admission rates or emergency department attendance rates due to asthma exacerbation. Likewise, no studies assessed days missed from work or school due to asthma exacerbations.</P>
<P>Nine studies (1071 participants) assessed BDP 400 mcg/d compared to placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Bel-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Bel 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bennati-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Bennati 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bergmann-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Bergmann 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Berkowitz-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Berkowitz 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Boner-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Boner 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fahy-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Fahy 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Matthys-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Matthys 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Simons-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Simons 1997</LINK>,<LINK REF="STD-Nathan-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Nathan 2001</LINK>). BDP resulted in significantly fewer asthma exacerbation-related withdrawals than placebo RR 0.29 (95% CI 0.18 to 0.48). This result was not significantly altered by a sensitivity analysis that excluded the single low quality study (<LINK REF="STD-Bergmann-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Bergmann 1990</LINK>). Three studies were in children (<LINK REF="STD-Bennati-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Bennati 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Boner-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Boner 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Simons-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Simons 1997</LINK>), four in adults (<LINK REF="STD-Bel-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Bel 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Berkowitz-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Berkowitz 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fahy-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Fahy 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Matthys-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Matthys 1998</LINK>) and two in children and adults (<LINK REF="STD-Bergmann-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Bergmann 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nathan-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Nathan 2001</LINK>): there was no heterogeneity in effect size across studies. In only two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Berkowitz-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Berkowitz 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Simons-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Simons 1997</LINK>) was it clear from the study protocol that a criterion for withdrawal due to asthma exacerbation had been set a priori (see Included Study Characteristics).</P>
<P>Two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Hoshino-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Hoshino 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vogt-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Vogt 1976</LINK>) with 117 participants, both in adults compared BDP 800 mcg/d to placebo. No significant difference in withdrawal rates due to exacerbations were apparent between treatment groups, RR 0.34 (95% CI 0.09 to 1.30).</P>
<P>Treatment with BDP 1000 mcg/d or greater resulted in significantly fewer asthma exacerbation-related withdrawals compared to placebo RR 0.08 (95% CI 0.02 to 0.41). This analysis included three studies in adults (<LINK REF="STD-Pennings-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Pennings 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Salmeron-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Salmeron 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Trigg-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Trigg 1994</LINK>) and one study in children and adults (<LINK REF="STD-Fanelli-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Fanelli 1993</LINK>) with a total of 159 subjects. A sensitivity analysis that excluded the single low quality study (<LINK REF="STD-Fanelli-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Fanelli 1993</LINK>) produced a similar result. In one study (<LINK REF="STD-Salmeron-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Salmeron 1989</LINK>) criteria for exacerbation-related withdrawal were pre-defined (see Characteristics of Included Studies).<BR/>
<BR/>When all 10 studies, (1185 participants) were pooled irrespective of BDP dose a significant effect in favour of BDP was apparent, RR 0.25 (95% CI 0.16 to 0.39). There was no heterogeneity between studies and the 95% confidence intervals for treatment effect for each dose overlapped, no trend suggesting a dose response effect was seen. Subgroup analyses based upon delivery device, study duration and asthma severity did not demonstrate any groups who appeared to benefit preferentially. However, it is noteworthy that when trials were analysed according to treatment duration, a significant effect in favour of BDP was only seen for the subgroup of studies incorporating a treatment period in excess of four weeks. This raises the possibility that treatment duration may have an important influence on effect size for this outcome.</P>

No heterogeneity was present for any comparison. When studies were pooled across all doses no difference between BDP and placebo groups was seen, RR 1.30 (95% CI 0.73 to 2.33). No significant difference in pharyngitis was observed when data from three studies assessing 400mcg/d BDP were pooled (<LINK REF="STD-Laviolette-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Laviolette 1999</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Malmstrom-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Malmstrom 1999</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Nathan-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Nathan 2001</LINK>): RR 1.27 (95%CI 0.48 to 3.37).</P>

<BR/>Two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Bernstein-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Bernstein 1999</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Nathan-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Nathan 2001</LINK>) evaluated the effect of BDP 400 mcg/d on the incidence of oral candidiasis. There was no significant difference presented between BDP and placebo, RR 3.75 (95% CI 0.62 to 22.57). One high dose study (<LINK REF="STD-Pennings-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Pennings 1997</LINK>) assessed the effects of 1000 mcg/d on the incidence of oral candidiasis. In this study, diagnosis was based on clinical impression and was not confirmed by swab culture. When studies were pooled across doses, no difference between BDP and placebo was apparent RR 3.56 (95%CI 0.75 to 16.90).</P>

<B>(3) OTHER OUTCOMES</B>
<BR/>One study of 44 subjects (<LINK REF="STD-Vatrella-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Vatrella 1996</LINK>) assessed BDP 1000 mcg/d and demonstrated significantly lower serum eosinophil cationic protein (ECP) levels in the BDP group compared to placebo, 285  126 compared with 475  95 %. The change in peripheral blood eosinophil count from baseline was assessed in one study (<LINK REF="STD-Malmstrom-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Malmstrom 1999</LINK>).

</P>
<P>
<B>(a) Absolute dose of oral steroids </B>
<BR/>BDP 400 mcg/d resulted in a significantly lower daily maintenance dose of oral prednisolone compared to placebo: WMD 6.3 mg/d (95% CI 3.9 to 8.7 mg/d). No heterogeneity in effect size was apparent. The adult patients in the two studies contributing to this analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Davies-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Davies 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Webb-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Webb 1977</LINK>) had similar baseline oral steroid requirements (mean daily dose 9 to 15 mg).</P>
<P>One study also in adults (<LINK REF="STD-Lacronique-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Lacronique 1991</LINK>) demonstrated a significant advantage of BDP 1000 mcg/d compared to placebo: mean difference 6.0 mg/d (95% CI 2.5 to 9.5 mg/d).</P>
<P>When studies were pooled across all doses, a significant effect in favour of BDP was found: WMD 6.2 mg/d (95% CI 4.3 to 8.2 mg/d). The 95% confidence intervals for the dose subgroups overlapped widely. There did not appear to be any trend to suggest a dose response effect.</P>
<P>All studies employed a pMDI and were between one and five months duration. Hence subgroup analyses based on delivery device and study duration were not possible.</P>

<B>(b) Change in dose of oral steroids</B>
<BR/>In two OCS sparing studies (<LINK REF="STD-Cameron-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Cameron 1973</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kerigan-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Kerigan 1977</LINK>), assessing BDP 400 mcg/d data were reported as the reduction in daily dose of prednisolone. BDP 400 mcg/d resulted in significant reductions in the daily dose of maintenance oral prednisolone compared to placebo WMD 4.91 mg/d (95% CI 5.9 to 3.9 mg/d). Although both studies reported a significant reduction in prednisolone use there was significant heterogeneity (I square 77%). A sensitivity analysis based on methodological quality resulted in the exclusion of one study (<LINK REF="STD-Kerigan-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Kerigan 1977</LINK>), but made no difference to the overall conclusion.</P>
<P>
<B>(c) Discontinuation of oral steroids</B>
<BR/>BDP 400 mcg/d resulted in a significantly greater likelihood of discontinuing oral steroids compared to placebo (RR 3.43 (95% CI 2.39 to 4.92). Five studies (174 participants) contributed to this analysis and although significant heterogeneity was apparent (I square 59.1%), Random Effects modelling did not alter the significance of the result.</P>
<P>
<B>(2) SPIROMETRY, PEFR AND SYMPTOMS</B>
<BR/>Spirometry, PEFR and symptom scores were reported rarely. Only two studies in oral steroid treated subjects reported numerical data for these outcomes.</P>
<P>A single study in adults over 12 weeks (<LINK REF="STD-Davies-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Davies 1977</LINK>) that assessed the effect of BDP 400 mcg/d on FEV1 (% predicted) found no advantage of active treatment over placebo.</P>
<P>A single study in adults over 12 weeks (<LINK REF="STD-Lacronique-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Lacronique 1991</LINK>) assessed the effects of BDP 1000 mcg/d versus placebo on percentage change in FEV1 compared to baseline. A significant effect in favour of active treatment was found, mean difference 13% (95% CI 5 to 21). The same study also demonstrated a significant advantage of BDP 1000 mcg/d over placebo for clinic measured PEFR, mean difference (95% CI) 8 % predicted (95% CI 2 to 14 % predicted). A significant advantage of BDP over placebo was also apparent for daily asthma symptom score, mean difference 0.7 (95% CI 0.3 to 1.1).</P>
<P>
<B>(3) LOCAL SIDE EFFECTS </B>
<BR/>The incidence of oropharyngeal side effects (sore or dry mouth/throat, hoarseness) and oropharyngeal Candidiasis were reported rarely. A single study in adults (<LINK REF="STD-BTTA-1976" TYPE="STUDY">BTTA 1976</LINK>) assessed the effects of both low dose (400 mcg/d) and medium dose (800 mcg/d) BDP versus placebo on the incidence of hoarseness and did not find a significant difference between active intervention and placebo for either dose.</P>
<P>A single study in adults (<LINK REF="STD-Brompton_x002f_MRC-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Brompton/MRC 1974</LINK>) also assessing low dose (400 mcg/d) and medium dose (800 mcg/d) BDP found a significantly lower likelihood of oral Candidiasis in placebo treated participants compared to those who received both doses: BDP 400 mcg/d RR 4.7 (95% CI 1.5 to 14.8); BDP 800 mcg/d RR 8 (95% CI 2.7 to 24.0). Diagnosis was based upon a combination of clinical features (erythema associated with discrete or confluent white patches), and throat swab culture.</P>

<U>ASTHMATICS TREATED WITH OCS: NON-OCS SPARING STUDY DESIGN</U>
</B>
<U>
<BR/>
</U>
<BR/>One study (<LINK REF="STD-Kerrebijn-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Kerrebijn 1976</LINK>), undertaken in the early years following the introduction of inhaled BDP for the treatment of chronic asthma. The results from these study had not been included in the meta-analysis for a number of reasons:</P>
<P>a) there was no attempt to taper OCS use during the treatment period of the trial so the minimum effective dose of OCS was not established.</P>
<P>b) Numerical data in a form suitable for meta-analysis were not reported in the published papers. The author responded to letters for data requests (<LINK REF="STD-Kerrebijn-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Kerrebijn 1976</LINK>) but were unable to provide missing data.</P>
<P>The characteristics of this study and a description of results were outlined in the Characteristics of Included Studies section, however the reader was referred to the original publications for further details.</P>

</P>
<P>Three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Gross-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Gross 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hampel-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Hampel 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nayak-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Nayak 2002</LINK>) were identified for inclusion. There was an important difference in the design of the <LINK REF="STD-Gross-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Gross 1999</LINK> study compared with <LINK REF="STD-Hampel-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Hampel 2000</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Nayak-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Nayak 2002</LINK>. <LINK REF="STD-Gross-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Gross 1999</LINK> administered a course of oral steroids to participants, and subsequently maintained participants on a dose of HFA-BDP that was higher than the dosage used in <LINK REF="STD-Hampel-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Hampel 2000</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Nayak-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Nayak 2002</LINK>. When data were pooled for outcomes such as beta-agonist use and PEF, the level of heterogeneity was very high. We therefore report the pooled effects of these studies with and without the <LINK REF="STD-Gross-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Gross 1999</LINK> data.</P>
<P>We have only performed subgroup analyses according to age. In order to prevent double-counting participants we have pooled data separately from the lowest dose arms of <LINK REF="STD-Hampel-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Hampel 2000</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Nayak-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Nayak 2002</LINK> (100mcg - see comparison 12) and from the moderate dose arms (160/200mcg - see comparison 13).</P>

<BR/>HFA-BDP led to significant improvements in FEV1 (% predicted) from baseline when compared to placebo, for both BDP at a daily dose of 160-200 mcg (6.36% (95%CI 3.94 to 8.78)) and at a daily dose of 100 mcg/d (5.9% (95% CI 3.40 to 8.78)).<BR/>

<LINK REF="STD-Hampel-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Hampel 2000</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Gross-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Gross 1999</LINK> reported significant differences in favour of BDP, but when pooled, there was significant heterogeneity (comparison 12: I square: 90%; comparison 13: I square: 86.4%). As there were only two studies, any exploration of heterogeneity would only serve to highlight differences at trial level. The differences do not simply encompass pre-treatment with oral steroids or dose of inhaled steroid, but also extend to severity and study duration. Both Fixed Effect and Random Effects modelling gave significant effects. However, the Random Effects model gave a confidence interval that was considerably wider than that generated by the Fixed Effect model for both comparisons: Comparison 12 FE: 40.49 L/min (95% CI 30.09 to 50.89); RE: 41.22 L/min (95% CI 8.29 to 74.15); comparison 13: FE: 43.21 L/min (95% CI 32.64 to 53.79), RE: 43.42 L/min (95% CI 14.70 to 72.13). </P>

<B>
<BR/>(2) RESCUE BETA-2 AGONIST USE </B>
</P>
<P>
<B>(a) Change in rescue-beta2 agonist use</B>
<BR/>There was a high level of heterogeneity when the studies were pooled (comparison 12: I square: 86.6%; comparison 13: I square: 76.7%). Data pooled with a Fixed Effect model from the three studies indicated that there was a significant reduction in rescue medication by -0.64 puffs/day (95% CI -0.87 to -0.41, comparison 12) or -0.81 puffs/day (95% CI -1.01 to -0.61, comparison 13). With Random Effects modelling the difference remained significant in both instances, but the confidence intervals widened considerably (comparison 12: -0.78 puffs/day (-1.43 to -0.13); comparison 13: -0.88 puffs/day (-1.34 to -0.41)). In the outcome data assessed under comparison 12, the pooled subgroup effect estimates did not overlap when a Fixed Effect model was applied, which suggested that there may have been a different response in adults in children. However, there was an overlap in comparison 13.</P>
<P>
<B>(3) ASTHMA SYMPTOM SCORE</B>
</P>
<P>
<B>(a) Change in symptoms</B>
<BR/>Asthma symptoms recorded using a daily diary card were reported in two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Hampel-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Hampel 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nayak-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Nayak 2002</LINK>), although we were unable to pool data due to different measurement of outcome. <LINK REF="STD-Hampel-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Hampel 2000</LINK> adopted a six point scoring system from zero (no symptoms present) to 5 (symptoms prevented normal activities). <LINK REF="STD-Nayak-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Nayak 2002</LINK> used a four point system, 0=none and 3= severe symptoms. Symptoms were assessed across four domains: Wheezing, cough, shortness of breath and chest tightness. HFA-BDP for all doses was better than placebo in controlling asthma symptoms. Each individual study reported significant improvements in most domains for both lower and higher dose range comparisons with placebo.</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2008-07-21 14:17:14 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>This review compared the efficacy and safety of HFA-BDP and CFC-BDP with placebo in patients with persistent asthma. 60 randomised trials recruiting 6542 adults and children with asthma were included, and the overall methodological quality of studies was high. 57 trials compared CFC-BDP at varied doses with placebo, and three studies assessed the efficacy of HFA-BDP compared with placebo. The studies varied in terms of BDP dose, treatment duration, delivery device and outcome measures reported.<BR/>
<B>
<BR/>Asthmatics not treated with oral steroids</B>
<BR/>The majority of studies contributing to the meta-analysis were in adult participants. CFC-BDP resulted in statistically significant improvements in FEV1 compared to placebo. The observed differences may be of clinical significance, although the level of clinically significant change for these measures has never been formally established in asthma.</P>
<P>CFC-BDP treatment led to significantly greater morning PEFR compared to placebo of 46.52 L/min (95% CI 15.1 to 108.21). No active treatment advantage was apparent for evening PEFR or diurnal variability in PEFR. Significantly less rescue beta2 agonist was required in BDP treated patients: 1.98 puffs/d (95% CI 1.62 to 2.34 puffs/day). A wide variety of scales were used to assess symptoms, and the quality of reporting was poor with a substantial number of trials failing to provide standard deviation values for mean treatment effects. The data for daily asthma symptoms, where available, suggest that BDP results in significantly less symptoms. However, because no validated symptom scores were used (with clinically worthwhile thresholds established) and treatment effects had to be expressed using a unitless standardised mean difference, the treatment differences between BDP and placebo are difficult to translate into a clinically meaningful measures.</P>
<P>Methacholine and histamine BHR, which are surrogate markers for the degree of airway inflammation, were significantly improved in BDP treated participants compared to placebo.</P>
<P>Important outcome measures such as hospital admission rates, GP attendance rates and days lost from school/work due to asthma exacerbations were not reported. Withdrawal rates in the context of a clinical trial cannot be considered equivalent to hospital admission rates or GP attendance rates due to exacerbation but may be a surrogate marker for these. The likelihood of withdrawal from study due to asthma exacerbation was significantly less in BDP treated participants compared to placebo; RR 0. 25(95% CI 0.16 to 0.39). However, it is not appropriate to calculate numbers needed to treat as studies contributing to the analysis had widely varying treatment periods and criteria for withdrawal.</P>
<P>Subgroup analyses based on treatment duration raise the possibility that this is an important determinant of overall treatment response. When studies reporting FEV1 and trial withdrawal due to exacerbation were pooled according to treatment period of four weeks or treatment period greater than four weeks, a significant effect in favour of BDP was only seen for studies of longer duration.</P>
<P>No differences in the incidence of local side effects in the form of sore throat, hoarseness or oral candidiasis were apparent. The effects on HPA function were rarely reported. No two studies reported the same outcome measure and conflicting results were found. The studies assessing HPA function by insulin and synthetic ACTH stress testing did not demonstrate a significant difference in response between BDP and placebo treated participants. Too few studies reported such outcomes to draw meaningful conclusions.</P>
<P>Evidence in support of a dose response effect was not apparent for any efficacy outcome. However, caution needs to be exercised in interpreting this finding for two reasons. Firstly, dose response effects are best assessed in the context of individual trials in which participants have been randomised to different doses of active treatment, with comparisons made between treatments. Secondly, it was only possible to include the results of two studies judged to have recruited participants with moderate to severe asthma in the meta-analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Radha-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Radha 1975</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vogt-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Vogt 1976</LINK>). A clinically meaningful dose response effect is most likely to be seen in severe asthmatics who will have the greatest margin for improvement in outcomes reflecting the degree of asthma control. This group is under-represented in this analysis. In the absence of trials, it is not possible to predict whether or not a dose-response effect will be seen in more severe disease. Although patients with severe asthma have greater room for improvement, it should also be appreciated that even in mild asthma, BDP only ameliorates and does not abolish asthma effects. Another unknown variable is the level of steroid responsiveness. Inadequate control of symptoms through existing therapy is one marker used to define asthma severity. Thus patients with 'severe' asthma have, by and large, failed to respond adequately to inhaled steroids. Hence an alternative possibility is that 'severe' patients may be selected by their lack steroid responsiveness, so may not show a significant dose-response effect. These possibilities need to be explored by future studies.<BR/>
<B>
<BR/>
</B>It is noteworthy that there were differing levels of heterogeneity when data from CFC and HFA-BDP treatment arms in <LINK REF="STD-Gross-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Gross 1999</LINK> were pooled in their respective analyses. It would be inaccurate to conclude that at a dose ratio of 1:2, CFC and HFA-BDP are equivalent for three reasons. Firstly, such an interpretation would be based on a relatively weak comparison between heterogeneity statistics. Secondly, we only have data that suggest this on change in am PEF, but not on change in rescue medication use as heterogeneity was high in both sets of analyses. Lastly this interpretation assumes that the oral steroid pre-treatment phase in <LINK REF="STD-Gross-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Gross 1999</LINK> produced a similar baseline population to those in the other trials. Findings from two large randomised studies indicate that on certain outcomes such as beta-agonist use, HFA-BDP is equivalent to CFC-BDP at half the dose (<LINK REF="STD-Gross-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Gross 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Busse-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Busse 1999</LINK>). Whilst this review has not examined head-to-head comparisons between doses of BDP, the different levels of heterogeneity in the CFC and HFA-BDP analyses may be explained in part by a steep dose response curve to HFA-BDP on certain clinical outcomes. The predosing schedule could also have contributed to the different responses to treatment from this study. Systematic assessments of the equivalence between doses of CFC and HFA-BDP in randomised comparisons, and the 'optimisation' of oral steroid treatment prior to randomisation are warranted before more comment can be made on these results. </P>
<P>Both CFC-BDP and HFA-BDP were well tolerated and there were no drug or propellant related safety concerns.<BR/>
<BR/>
<B>Oral steroid treated asthmatics</B>
<BR/>BDP treatment resulted in a clinically significant oral steroid sparing effect compared to placebo. The end of trial mean daily prednisolone dose was 6 mg/d (95% CI 4 to 8 mg/d) lower in BDP treated participants compared to placebo. Reductions in daily dose of 5 mg/d (95% CI 4 to 6 mg/d) in BDP treated participants were achieved. The likelihood of discontinuing oral steroids was significantly greater for BDP treated participants compared to placebo RR 0.40 (95% CI 0.23 to 0.70). It was not appropriate to calculate numbers needed to treat as trials were of varying duration.</P>
<P>The effects of BDP on measures of airway calibre (FEV1, PEFR), symptoms and local side effects in OCS treated asthmatics were assessed in one trial only. Three studies used different scales reported such outcomes; and conflicting results were found (non-significant differences or small effects in favour of BDP therapy). No firm conclusions concerning the effects of treatment can be drawn for these outcomes.</P>
<P>It should be noted that only studies conducted in adult patients contributed to these analyses; generalisation to children with oral steroid dependent asthma therefore needs to be made with caution.</P>
<P>
<B>Methodological Limitations</B>
<BR/>(1) The possibility of bias related to missed published trials occurs in all systematic reviews. The initial search identified studies conducted over the course of the last three decades (1973 to 1998). Given the wide time period, volume of literature and the fact that eight foreign language publications are still awaiting translation in order to assess their eligibility raises the possibility that studies were missed despite a comprehensive search strategy. This risk is somewhat offset by the fact that only one further study was identified from correspondence with authors and that GSK, sponsors of a large proportion of BDP related studies did not identify any further trials from their own records.</P>
<P>(2) Bias related to missed unpublished 'negative' trials is a further possibility. However, a funnel plot of withdrawal due to asthma exacerbation in the non-OCS treated parallel group studies showed spread of results to both sides of the overall relative risk. This suggests that there was no major bias of this type.</P>
<P>(3) A large number of efficacy outcomes were reported, using a range of different scales. This factor, combined with a significant proportion of studies in which numerical data were either not presented with standard deviations around mean scores or in which authors were unable or unwilling to provide such data, reduced the power of the analysis.</P>
<P>(4) The majority of studies were conducted in a secondary care setting, with patients attending hospital outpatient clinics for review. In most instances it was not clear how patients were identified as potential recruits (e.g. patients already attending hospital asthma clinics, primary care referrals, advertisement etc). Only one study was carried out in a primary care. Study setting may therefore have biased recruitment towards patients with more symptoms, since they have been largely conducted in secondary care.<BR/>
<BR/>(5) The identification of three ranges for nominal daily BDP dose are arbitrary. However the range boundaries were felt to generally reflect current dose distinctions made in clinical practice.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>This review strongly supports the use of inhaled BDP in the treatment of chronic asthma for at least 4 weeks duration. CFC-BDP and HFA-BDP improve airflow limitation, reduce symptoms and the need for rescue bronchodilators and reduce the likelihood of exacerbations when compared to placebo. These findings apply to children and adults, with all degrees of disease severity. </P>
<P>In oral steroid treated patients, inhaled CFC-BDP had a clinically significant oral steroid sparing effect. Although oral steroids are no longer a first line therapy for asthma in developed countries it is likely that in some areas of the world a substantial proportion of asthmatics are receiving oral steroids who could be maintained on inhaled BDP. This review supports a recommendation that all such patients should receive a trial of inhaled BDP for asthma control, for even in patients in whom oral steroids cannot be stopped entirely, worthwhile reductions in dose are possible.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>(1) Consistent methods of reporting symptoms aided by the development of a validated questionnaire (with established thresholds of clinical importance) would greatly assist in the interpretation of symptom changes in response to therapy.</P>
<P>(2) Measurement of economically important outcomes such as hospital admission rates, primary care attendance and days missed from work/school due to asthma exacerbations are needed in any future studies.</P>
<P>(3) Improved reporting of primary study methods (particularly details of how patients are allocated to treatment groups) in line with <LINK REF="REF-CONSORT-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">CONSORT 1996</LINK> recommendations would improve the accuracy of systematic reviews. </P>
<P>(4) Assessment of any potential clinically relevant dose response effect for BDP in the treatment of asthma will be best achieved by a further systematic review assessing trials in which patients have been randomised to low and high dose BDP within the same trial. It is hoped that this will include trials recruiting subjects with severe asthma as well as those with mild to moderate disease.</P>
<P>(5) Establish the minimum duration of treatment required for a clinically meaningful treatment response for BDP.</P>
<P>(6) Head-to-head comparisons of low-moderate doses of HFA-BDP would also help to establish the validity of pooling doses of less than 400mcg/day. <B>
