<P>Medical treatments for inevitable miscarriage.</P>
<P>Pregnancies that miscarry can sometimes be identified earlier at an ultrasound scan if the loss is due to the baby having died or no baby having developed. In the past, treatment before 14 weeks has usually been by surgery (D&amp;C) but drugs have now been developed which may be helpful, or waiting for the miscarriage to happen may be a better alternative. The review of trials assessed various potential drug treatments using different routes and different doses, compared with waiting for the miscarriage. This review identified 24 studies involving 1888 women of less than 24 weeks gestation, where the baby had died in the uterus or the baby had not formed in the uterus. Most studies were of good quality. Vaginal misoprostol brought forward the time of the miscarriage, but the studies were too small to adequately assess potential adverse effects, including future fertility. Oral misoprostol seemed less effective than the vaginal route, and women took more sick-leave with the oral drugs. Some women may wish to hasten an inevitable miscarriage, and others may not. It appears that both forms of care can be available to women. Women who are breastfeeding an older baby may prefer to wait rather than have drug treatment. Further research is needed on drug doses, routes of administration and potential adverse effects, including future fertility, and also on women's views of drug treatment, surgery and waiting for spontaneous miscarriage.</P>

<ABSTRACT MODIFIED="2012-08-08 10:32:35 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>In most pregnancies that miscarry, arrest of embryonic or fetal development occurs some time (often weeks) before the miscarriage occurs. Ultrasound examination can reveal abnormal findings during this phase by demonstrating anembryonic pregnancies or embryonic or fetal death. Treatment before 14 weeks has traditionally been surgical but medical treatments may be effective, safe, and acceptable, as may be waiting for spontaneous miscarriage.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To assess the effectiveness, safety and acceptability of any medical treatment for early pregnancy failure (anembryonic pregnancies or embryonic and fetal deaths before 24 weeks). </P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2012-08-08 10:18:07 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group Trials Register (30 November 2005). We updated this search on 6 August 2012 and added the results to the awaiting classification section of the review.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomised trials comparing medical treatment with another treatment (e.g. surgical evacuation), or placebo, or no treatment for early pregnancy failure. Quasi-random studies were excluded.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Data were extracted unblinded.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Twenty four studies (1888 women) were included. </P>
<P>Vaginal misoprostol hastens miscarriage (complete or incomplete) when compared with placebo: e.g. miscarriage less than 24 hours (two trials, 138 women, relative risk (RR) 4.73, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.70 to 8.28), with less need for uterine curettage (two trials, 104 women, RR 0.40, 95% CI 0.26 to 0.60) and no significant increase in nausea or diarrhoea. Lower-dose regimens of vaginal misoprostol tend to be less effective in producing miscarriage (three trials, 247 women, RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.00) with similar incidence of nausea. There seems no clear advantage to administering a 'wet' preparation of vaginal misoprostol or of adding methotrexate, or of using laminaria tents after 14 weeks. Vaginal misoprostol is more effective than vaginal prostaglandin E in avoiding surgical evacuation. Oral misoprostol was less effective than vaginal misoprostol in producing complete miscarriage (two trials, 218 women, RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.82 to 0.99). Sublingual misoprostol had equivalent efficacy to vaginal misoprostol in inducing complete miscarriage but was associated with more frequent diarrhoea. The two trials of mifepristone treatment generated conflicting results. There was no statistically significant difference between vaginal misoprostol and gemeprost in the induction of miscarriage for fetal death after 13 weeks. </P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2012-08-08 10:32:35 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Available evidence from randomised trials supports the use of vaginal misoprostol as a medical treatment to terminate non-viable pregnancies before 24 weeks. Further research is required to assess effectiveness and safety, optimal route of administration and dose. Conflicting findings about the value of mifepristone need to be resolved by additional study.</P>

</ABSTRACT>
<BODY MODIFIED="2012-08-08 10:37:27 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND>
<P>The incidence of clinically obvious miscarriage is considered to be between 10% and 15% of all pregnancies, although the real incidence may be considerably higher (<LINK REF="REF-Grudzinskas-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grudzinskas 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Howie-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Howie 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Simpson-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Simpson 1991</LINK>). </P>
<P>The widespread use of ultrasound in early pregnancy for either specific reasons (for example, vaginal bleeding) or as a routine examination (<LINK REF="REF-Neilson-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Neilson 1998</LINK>) reveals 'non-viable pregnancies' destined inevitably to miscarry in due course. These are termed 'anembryonic pregnancies' (formerly called 'blighted ova') if no embryo has developed within the gestation sac, or 'missed abortions' if an embryo or fetus is present, but is dead. </P>
<P>The protocol for this review aimed to combine trials of medical treatments for both non-viable pregnancies and for incomplete miscarriage but on further reflection, this was illogical. Non-viable pregnancies contain viable trophoblast (placental) tissue, which produces hormones, which may in theory make these pregnancies more susceptible to anti-hormone therapy and more resistant to uterotonic (stimulating uterine contractions) therapy than pregnancies in which (incomplete) miscarriage has already taken place. This review will therefore focus exclusively on non-viable pregnancies, before miscarriage. Another review will assess trials of medical treatments after miscarriage has occurred (<LINK REF="REF-Vazquez-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vazquez 2000</LINK>). A further review compares expectant management with surgical treatment for miscarriage (<LINK REF="REF-Nanda-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nanda 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>Traditionally, early non-viable pregnancies (less than 14 weeks) have been terminated by surgical evacuation. Later pregnancies (14 to 24 weeks) have been ended by medical induction of miscarriage. </P>
<P>Various types of medical treatment could be suitable as alternatives to surgical treatment: misoprostol is a prostaglandin E1 analogue, marketed for the prevention and treatment of peptic ulcers. Recognized as a potent method for terminating unwanted viable pregnancies (<LINK REF="REF-Costa-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Costa 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Norman-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Norman 1991</LINK>), it is cheap, stable at room temperature and has few systemic effects, although vomiting, diarrhoea, hypertension and even potential teratogenicity when misoprostol fails to induce abortion have been reported (<LINK REF="REF-Fonseca-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fonseca 1991</LINK>). Misoprostol has been shown to be an effective myometrial stimulant of the pregnant uterus, selectively binding to EP-2/EP-3 prostanoid receptors (<LINK REF="REF-Senior-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Senior 1993</LINK>). It is rapidly absorbed orally and vaginally. Vaginally absorbed serum levels are more prolonged and vaginal misoprostol may have locally mediated effects (<LINK REF="REF-Zieman-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zieman 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>Misoprostol could be especially useful in developing countries, where transport and storage facilities are inadequate and the availability of uterotonic agents and blood is limited. Its use in obstetrics and gynecology has been explored, especially to induce first and second trimester abortion (<LINK REF="REF-Ashok-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ashok 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bugalho-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bugalho 1996</LINK>), for the induction of labour (<LINK REF="REF-Alfirevic-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alfirevic 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hofmeyr-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hofmeyr 2003</LINK>) and for the prevention of postpartum haemorrhage (<LINK REF="REF-Gulmezoglu-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gulmezoglu 2004</LINK>) despite the fact that it has not been registered for such use. </P>
<P>Other uterotonic drugs that could have a role would include ergometrine, oxytocin, and prostaglandin F2alpha. </P>
<P>The progesterone antagonist, mifepristone, is of value in terminating early unwanted pregnancies and may be of use in non-viable pregnancies and spontaneous miscarriage (<LINK REF="REF-Baulieu-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baulieu 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kovacs-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kovacs 1984</LINK>), alone or in combination with prostaglandin (<LINK REF="REF-Cameron-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cameron 1986</LINK>). </P>
<P>Methotrexate may be helpful in the medical treatment of ectopic pregnancy and might therefore have a place in the treatment of intrauterine non-viable pregnancies as well. It has also been used for the early termination of unwanted pregnancy, followed by a uterotonic agent such as misoprostol.</P>
<P>Although clotting problems occasionally occur in women with prolonged retention of a dead fetus, this is rare and does not usually happen within the first month after fetal death. There are, therefore, not pressing medical reasons to terminate non-viable pregnancies. Although, anecdotally, many women favour early termination, so-called 'expectant management' (that is, awaiting spontaneous miscarriage) is a legitimate alternative and this policy should be considered in clinical care and in planning trials.</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>To assess, from clinical trials, the effectiveness and safety of different medical treatments for the termination of non-viable pregnancies, with reference to death or serious complications, additional surgical evacuation, blood transfusion, haemorrhage, blood loss, anaemia, days of bleeding, pain relief, pelvic infection, cervical damage, duration of stay in hospital, psychological effects, subsequent fertility, women's satisfaction and costs.</P>

<CRIT_STUDIES>
<P>Randomised clinical trials comparing a medical treatment with another treatment (for example, surgical evacuation), or placebo, or no treatment to terminate non-viable pregnancies; random allocation to treatment and comparison groups; reasonable measures to ensure allocation concealment; and violations of allocated management not sufficient to materially affect outcomes.

In addition to the main outcome measures listed above, information on the setting of the study (country, type of population, socioeconomic status), the method of randomisation, a detailed description of the regimen used (drug(s), route, dose, frequency), definitions of the outcomes (if provided), and whether or not clinicians and participants were 'blind' to treatment allocated, were all collected. An intention-to-treat analysis was performed where possible. Any information on completeness of follow up was collected as well.</P>
<P>Trials were assessed for methodological quality using the standard Cochrane criteria of adequacy of allocation concealment:<BR/>(A) adequate;<BR/>(B) unclear;<BR/>(C) inadequate;<BR/>(D) allocation concealment was not used.</P>
<P>We collected information on blinding of outcome assessment and loss to follow up.</P>
<P>Separate comparisons were made of different drug regimens, grouped where appropriate by number of doses given and the route of administration. Summary relative risks were calculated using a fixed-effect model (providing there was no significant heterogeneity between trials - defined as I squared greater than 50%). Because of the small number of trials and comparisons, it was impossible to perform sensitivity analysis using trial quality (A versus B, C, D).</P>

<P>Five of the 24 included studies addressed medical treatment of non-viable pregnancies after 14 weeks (<LINK REF="STD-Eng-1997_x002a_" TYPE="STUDY">Eng 1997*</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fadalla-2004_x002a_" TYPE="STUDY">Fadalla 2004*</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jain-1996_x002a_" TYPE="STUDY">Jain 1996*</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kara-1999_x002a_" TYPE="STUDY">Kara 1999*</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Niromanesh-2005_x002a_" TYPE="STUDY">Niromanesh 2005*</LINK>). These are labelled with an asterisk for ease of interpretation.</P>
<P>There are additional trials that have included data on women with both non-viable pregnancies and incomplete miscarriages (for example, <LINK REF="STD-Ngai-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Ngai 2001</LINK>). If these can be separated by the researchers, these data may be included in the future.</P>

</STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<STUDY_QUALITY>
<P>Thirteen studies used robust methods of allocation concealment (<LINK REF="STD-Autry-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Autry 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bagratee-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Bagratee 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Creinin-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Creinin 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Demetroulis-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Demetroulis 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gilles-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Gilles 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Graziosi-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Graziosi 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kovavisarach-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Kovavisarach 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lelaidier-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Lelaidier 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lister-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Lister 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Muffley-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Muffley 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ngoc-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Ngoc 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tang-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Tang 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wood-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Wood 2002</LINK>). Nine reports failed to describe the process of randomisation (<LINK REF="STD-Al-Inizi-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Al Inizi 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Egarter-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Egarter 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fadalla-2004_x002a_" TYPE="STUDY">Fadalla 2004*</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Herabutya-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Herabutya 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jain-1996_x002a_" TYPE="STUDY">Jain 1996*</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kara-1999_x002a_" TYPE="STUDY">Kara 1999*</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kovavisarach-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Kovavisarach 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nielsen-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Nielsen 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Niromanesh-2005_x002a_" TYPE="STUDY">Niromanesh 2005*</LINK>). One study has been reported only in abstract - without randomisation details (<LINK REF="STD-Heard-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Heard 2002</LINK>). In one study, allocation was based on picking an un-numbered envelope from a pack - a method that is recognised to be less robust (<LINK REF="STD-Eng-1997_x002a_" TYPE="STUDY">Eng 1997*</LINK>).</P>
<P>In most trials, analysis by intention-to-treat was performed.</P>
<P>It was not possible to blind the physicians to the method of treatment in some studies - if this involved surgical evacuation of the uterus, alternative routes of drug administration (oral versus vaginal) or a policy of expectant management. It is, however, possible to blind the evaluator who assessed complications during the follow-up visit but no study made mention of this.</P>
<P>There was variation between studies in the timing of scheduled follow-up visits.</P>
</STUDY_QUALITY>
<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
<P>Twenty four studies, with a total of 1888 women, were included. Nineteen of the studies addressed termination of non-viable pregnancies before 14 weeks. </P>
<P>Treatment with vaginal misoprostol hastens miscarriage (passage of products of conception, whether complete or incomplete) when compared with placebo: miscarriage less than 24 hours (two trials, 138 women, relative risk (RR) 4.73, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.70 to 8.28); miscarriage less than 48 hours (two (other) trials, 84 women, RR 5.74, 95% CI 2.70 to 12.19); complete miscarriage without need for surgical intervention at seven days (one trial, 83 women, RR 2.99, 95% CI 1.80 to 4.99). There was less need for uterine curettage (two trials, 104 women, RR 0.40, 95% CI 0.26 to 0.60) and no statistically significant increase in adverse effects: nausea (two trials, 88 women, RR 1.38, 95% CI 0.43 to 4.40), diarrhoea (two trials, 88 women, RR 2.21, 95% CI 0.35 to 14.06). One study showed a reduction in costs associated with a strategy of starting treatment with misoprostol, compared to immediate curettage (mean difference EUR192, 95% CI 33 to 351), no obvious difference in subsequent fertility, and similar numbers of women (58%) who would choose the same treatment strategy in the future (<LINK REF="STD-Graziosi-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Graziosi 2004</LINK>); although more women who had complete miscarriage after misoprostol (76%) would choose this treatment than those who required subsequent curettage (38%).</P>
<P>Consistent with these observations, treatment with vaginal misoprostol decreases the need for surgical evacuation of the uterus when compared with a policy of arranging immediate surgical evacuation (three trials, 254 women, RR 0.42, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.52) at a cost of more nausea (one trial, 154 women, RR 21.85, 95% CI 1.31 to 364.37) and diarrhoea (one trial, 154 women, RR 40.85, 95% CI 2.52 to 662.57). </P>
<P>Vaginal misoprostol has been administered in doses of 400 mcg, 600 mcg, and 800 mcg in trials: lower-dose regimens tend to be less effective in producing miscarriage (three trials, 247 women, RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.00) with similar incidence of nausea (two trials, 214 women, RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.31 to 1.41). There seems no clear advantage to administering a 'wet' preparation of vaginal misoprostol compared to a 'dry' preparation: miscarriage less than three days (one trial, 80 women, RR 1.14, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.54). Adding methotrexate treatment to vaginal misoprostol has not been demonstrated to be advantageous in the single small trial to address this: miscarriage not complete after treatment (21 women, RR 0.26, 95% CI 0.01 to 5.65). Nor are laminaria tests proven useful adjuncts to vaginal misoprostol during the second trimester: complete miscarriage less than 24 hours (one trial, 38 women, RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.25), less than 48 hours (one trial, 38 women, RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.29). Vaginal misoprostol was more effective than vaginal prostaglandin E in avoiding surgical evacuation (one trial, 80 women, RR 0.39, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.72) and effecting complete miscarriage in the second trimester (one trial, 65 women, RR 1.44, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.96).</P>
<P>Overall, oral misoprostol was found to be less effective than vaginal misoprostol in producing complete miscarriage (two trials, 218 women, RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.82 to 0.99) but this difference was seen only with the 400 mcg oral dose (one trial, 20 women, RR 0.29, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.79) and not the 800 mcg oral dose (one trial, 198 women, RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.05). There was less vomiting with the oral regimen (one trial, 190 women, RR 0.29, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.84) but similar incidence of diarrhoea (two trials, 210 women, RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.66). There were high (and similar) levels of satisfaction with treatment (one trial, 198 women, RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.06). Oral misoprostol was slower than vaginal misoprostol in effecting miscarriage in a single trial of women with second trimester fetal death (weighted mean difference 4.10 hours, 95% CI 2.64 to 5.56).</P>
<P>Sublingual misoprostol had equivalent efficacy to vaginal misoprostol in inducing complete miscarriage (one trial, 80 women, RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.18) but was associated with more frequent diarrhoea (RR 2.65, 95% CI 1.48 to 4.38) but not other side-effects.</P>
<P>The two trials of mifepristone treatment generated conflicting results. One study found mifepristone to be much more effective than placebo: miscarriage complete by day five after treatment (46 women, RR 9.50, 95% CI 2.49 to 36.19). The other study compared treatment with mifepristone plus oral misoprostol with a policy of expectant management (no treatment); there was no statistically significant difference in complete miscarriage by day five (122 women, RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.30).</P>
<P>There was no statistically significant difference between vaginal misoprostol and gemeprost in the induction of miscarriage less than 24 hours for fetal death after 13 weeks (one trial, 50 women, RR 1.24, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.70). </P>
<P>There were few reports of serious adverse effects in the reported trials, but one woman required a bowel resection after uterine perforation at evacuation of the uterus (<LINK REF="STD-Egarter-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Egarter 1995</LINK>).<BR/> </P>
</INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>The large majority of included trials (21/24) addressed the use of misoprostol (mainly by vaginal administration). There is intense interest in the reproductive uses of misoprostol because it appears a potent method for pregnancy interruption as well as being cheap and stable at room temperature, and thus potentially especially useful in developing countries, where transport and storage facilities are inadequate and the availability of uterotonic agents and blood is limited. However, ultrasound imaging is needed to diagnose non-viable pregnancies and equipment is sparse in many developing countries. The reproductive use of misoprostol is considered in other Cochrane reviews, for indications that include termination of unwanted pregnancies (<LINK REF="REF-Kulier-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kulier 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Say-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Say 2002</LINK>), induction of labour (<LINK REF="REF-Alfirevic-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alfirevic 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hofmeyr-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hofmeyr 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Muzonzini-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Muzonzini 2004</LINK>) and prevention and treatment of postpartum haemorrhage (<LINK REF="REF-Gulmezoglu-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gulmezoglu 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mousa-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mousa 2003</LINK>). </P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2012-08-08 10:33:01 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Ultrasound demonstration of early pregnancy failure before 14 weeks is a common problem that merits greater research effort than has occurred to date. Further research is required to assess the effectiveness, safety and side-effects of misoprostol, including optimal route of administration and dose. Conflicting findings about the value of mifepristone need to be resolved by additional study. Women's views about the acceptability of medical treatment, surgical treatment and expectant management should be integral to future research protocols, as should economic assessments. Long-term outcome, notably subsequent fertility, deserves further study in appropriately powered randomised controlled studies.</P>

<CHAR_METHODS>
<P>Randomisation using a random number tables. Allocation concealment was accomplished in sequentially numbered opaque sealed envelopes made available at the time of enrollment in the study. Intention to treat analysis.</P>
</CHAR_METHODS>
<CHAR_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>21 women diagnosed with a non-viable first trimester intrauterine pregnancy up to 49 days gestation. Evidence of non-viability included one of the following findings on TVS: 1) mean gestational sac diameter greater than 18 mm and no embryonic pole; 2) embryonic pole 5-10 mm without cardiac activity; 3) intrauterine gestational sac with abnormal hCG titers. Others entry criteria: 1) 18 years of age or greater; 2) closed cervix on digital exam; 3) no known intolerance or allergy to misoprostol or MTX; 4) hemoglobin of 9 g/dl or greater; 5) platelet count of 100,000/mcl or greater; 6) no history of blood clotting disorders; 7) no active liver or renal disease; 8) ability and willingness to comply with visit schedule; 9) hCG less than 40 000 IU/l; and 10) easy access to a telephone and transportation.</P>
</CHAR_PARTICIPANTS>
<CHAR_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>Combined group (n = 12): IM MTX 50 mg/m2 body surface area (day 1) followed two days later (day 3) by vaginal misoprostol 800 mcg (by vaginal placement of four 200 mcg-tablets of misoprostol). If the gestational sac was present vaginal misoprostol was repeated. Misoprostol only group (n = 9): four 200 mcg-tablets placed in the vagina on day 1. The remainder of the follow up was similar to that for combined group.</P>
</CHAR_INTERVENTIONS>
<CHAR_OUTCOMES>
<P>Successful complete abortion: MTX plus misoprostol 12/12 vs misoprostol only 8/9. No blood transfusion or antibiotics. Positive urine pregnancy test at the initial follow-up appointment: 2/9 vs 7/7. Pain relief: 4/12 vs 4/9.</P>
</CHAR_OUTCOMES>
<CHAR_NOTES>
<P>Wisconsin, Milwaukee, USA. All women received: 1) prescription for 10 tablets acetaminophen with codeine (300 mg/30 mg) and 8 tablets of ibuprofen (600 mg); 2) instruction sheet including phone number to contact physician 24 hours/day; and a diary sheet to record symptoms, side-effects, and pain medication use. Data about side-effects (headache, nausea and emesis) and women's satisfaction reported as no separate data. Authors conclude that both treatments are effective regimens for the complete evacuation of non-viable early first trimester pregnancy, and represent a reasonable alternative for women wishing to avoid surgery.</P>
