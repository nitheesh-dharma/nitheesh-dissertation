<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2010-02-12 07:03:58 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Eosinophilic esophagitis (EE) is emerging globally as a significant cause of upper gastrointestinal disease in people with clinical symptoms of esophageal disease including a typical appearance of the esophagus and an increased number of eosinophil white blood cells when the esophagus is examined by an endoscope using high magnification.</P>
<P>The cause of EE is unknown, however dietary and/or environmental factors may be contributing factors. People with EE may have difficulty swallowing, vomiting, regurgitation, chest and/or abdominal pain and frequently fail to respond to treatment with antacids or anti-reflux surgery. Current therapies include steroids, therapies that target specific components of the immune system, such as mast cell inhibitors, leukotriene receptor antagonists, and immune modulators; dietary manipulation and esophageal dilatation, however there is no universal approach to treatment. Our systematic review of the literature identified only three randomised controlled trials evaluating the benefits and harms of medical treatments for EE, two in children and one in adults. One trial compared fluticasone, a steroid spray that is swallowed, with oral steroid (prednisone), one compared fluticasone (a steroid) with placebo and the third compared mepolizumab, a monoclonal antibody, with placebo. In children, fluticasone decreased vomiting more effectively than placebo but did not improve dysphagia. Histological remission was more marked in the fluticasone group compared with the placebo group. Esophageal candidiasis (thrush) was diagnosed in one participant on fluticasone. Another trial showed symptom improvement that was similar with fluticasone and with oral prednisolone. The majority of participants were symptom free at four weeks with no difference between the groups. Symptom relapse usually occurred within six weeks of stopping therapy and had occurred in 45% of all trial participants at six month follow-up with no difference between treatment groups in the rate or timing of relapse. There was improvement as assessed by examining the biopsies taken from the esophagus, in the majority of participants at four weeks, with no difference between the two groups. In the prednisone group, 40% had adverse effects and three withdrew early with severe adverse effects (hyperphagia, weight gain, and the 'moon-shaped' face often seen with steroid treatment (cushingoid features)). In the fluticasone group, 15% were diagnosed with esophageal candidiasis and 45% had a relapse of symptoms at week 24. In the third trial in adults, using monoclonal antibody, there was no difference in symptom response with mepolizumab compared to placebo, but the decrease in esophageal eosinophils was more marked with mepolizumab than placebo.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2010-02-11 07:57:06 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Eosinophilic esophagitis (EE) is an inflammatory disorder of the esophagus causing upper gastrointestinal symptoms and characterised by increased esophageal infiltration with intraepithelial eosinophils (IEE). It was originally described during the 1970s in adults with symptoms of esophagitis, who often had allergies, and who had high esophageal eosinophil counts. The American Gastroenterology Association (AGA) guidelines' diagnostic criteria for EE are clinical symptoms of esophageal disease, a<I> </I>histological abnormality of 15 or more IEE per High Power Field (hpf) on endoscopy, the exclusion of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and consistent endoscopic findings (<LINK REF="REF-Furuta-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Furuta 2007</LINK>).<I> </I>However, the criteria for the diagnosis of EE are not well defined (<LINK REF="REF-Bohm-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bohm 2008</LINK>). EE affects men more than women, the mean age of onset being nine (one to 21) years in children and 38 (14 to 89) years in adults (<LINK REF="REF-Furuta-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Furuta 2007</LINK>). In young children, symptoms may be associated with food intolerance, however dysphagia and food impaction occur more often in adults (<LINK REF="REF-Faubion-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Faubion 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Liacouras-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liacouras 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Orenstein-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Orenstein 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Croese-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Croese 2003</LINK>). In EE, the mucosa may look normal macroscopically, however thickening, ringing, furrowing and erosion have been reported (<LINK REF="REF-Hassall-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hassall 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Khan-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Khan 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Orenstein-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Orenstein 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>People with EE often have a family history of allergic disease including asthma, eczema, allergic rhinitis and food allergy and may have abnormal skin prick tests (<LINK REF="STD-Spergel-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Spergel 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Faubion-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Faubion 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Liacouras-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liacouras 1998</LINK>). Intolerance to ingested food or inhaled allergens has been suggested as a contributor to esophageal damage by eosinophils.<B> </B>Experiments in mice suggest that EE may be associated with inhaled allergens, rather than with oral allergens (<LINK REF="REF-Mishra-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mishra 2001</LINK>). In EE, mast cell numbers are increased, correlating with eosinophil numbers,<B> </B>and there is some cellular evidence that the inflammation in EE is similar to that occurring in other allergic diseases (<LINK REF="REF-Stone-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stone 2008</LINK>)<B>. </B>Up to 75% of patients with EE may be atopic and many have measurable food allergen-specific IgE<B> </B>(<LINK REF="REF-Stone-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stone 2008</LINK>). EE may respond clinically and histologically to a restricted diet, however the EE often recurs on the return to a normal diet (<LINK REF="REF-Stone-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stone 2008</LINK>).<B> </B>The Guidelines of the AGA (<LINK REF="REF-Furuta-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Furuta 2007</LINK>) highlight our lack of understanding of the pathophysiology of EE and the way in which eosinpophils contribute to tissue damage.</P>

<P>Two RCTs were conducted in children and evaluated the role of steroids (<LINK REF="STD-Konikoff-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Konikoff 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schaefer-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Schaefer 2008</LINK>), however they reported different criteria for the diagnosis of EE, for the inclusion of participants in the trial and for determining the histological response.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Konikoff-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Konikoff 2006</LINK> included participants in the age range three to 16 years, and in <LINK REF="STD-Schaefer-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Schaefer 2008</LINK>, the participants were aged one to 16 years. In the third study, the participants were adults (<LINK REF="STD-Straumann-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Straumann 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>In the studies with child participants, all the included children had a diagnosis of EE confirmed endoscopically. In <LINK REF="STD-Konikoff-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Konikoff 2006</LINK> endoscopic diagnosis included the presence of &gt;24 eosinophils per hpf in one or more esophageal biopsies and<I> </I>epithelial hyperplasia; failure to respond to prior acid suppression therapy (proton pump inhibitor, PPI) was not necessary for the diagnosis of EE. In <LINK REF="STD-Schaefer-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Schaefer 2008</LINK> the children were diagnosed with EE (<U>&gt;</U>15 eosinophils per hpf) and had a negative pH probe study. 58% of the participants in this study (<LINK REF="STD-Schaefer-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Schaefer 2008</LINK>) were positive for food allergies at entry to the trial and were asked to eliminate the relevant food.</P>
<P>Exclusion criteria in <LINK REF="STD-Konikoff-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Konikoff 2006</LINK> were: food allergy by skin prick testing and response to an exclusion diet; if the participants had recently been prescribed steroids; or if they were pregnant. <LINK REF="STD-Schaefer-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Schaefer 2008</LINK> excluded participants from this study if they had any other gastrointestinal condition, e.g. <I>Helicobacter pylori</I> infection, chronic inflammatory bowel disease, or if they were on current corticosteroid treatment.</P>

<P>Two RCTs were conducted in children and evaluated the role of steroids. One study compared fluticasone propionate with placebo; fluticasone (400&#956;g twice daily for 23 months) was administered by a metered-dose inhaler but swallowed. Normal diet and PPI (if taken) were continued in both groups (<LINK REF="STD-Konikoff-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Konikoff 2006</LINK>). In the second study (<LINK REF="STD-Schaefer-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Schaefer 2008</LINK>), participants were randomised to four weeks treatment with either oral prednisone (1mg/kg/dose twice daily (each dose maximum of 30mg) and then weaned off the treatment over the next eight weeks, or topical (swallowed) fluticasone given by via metered dose inhaler (110µg per puff (age one to 10 years) and 22µg per puff (<U>&gt;</U>11 years of age) for three months.</P>
<P>Neither study evaluated long term maintenance therapy. In the third study, published as an abstract in conference proceedings, mepolizumab was compared with placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Straumann-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Straumann 2008</LINK>). Mepolizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody to interleukin-5 (IL-5), was given at a dose of 750mg at zero and seven days by intravenous infusions and, if the histological response was incomplete, two doses of 1500mg were given at four-weekly intervals up to a maximum of four doses.</P>

<P>A systematic search of the literature for RCTs evaluating treatments for EE identified three relevant RCTs. Two studies evaluated steroid therapy: one comparing swallowed fluticasone with placebo in children (<LINK REF="STD-Konikoff-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Konikoff 2006</LINK>); and one comparing oral prednisone with topical (swallowed metered dose) fluticasone in children (<LINK REF="STD-Schaefer-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Schaefer 2008</LINK>). One study compared mepolizumab to placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Straumann-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Straumann 2008</LINK>) in adults.</P>
<P>In the trial comparing fluticasone and placebo, the histological response was significantly higher in the treatment group (50% versus 9%, P&lt;0.047). Nevertheless, only half the children responded to fluticasone (<LINK REF="STD-Konikoff-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Konikoff 2006</LINK>), The response was better in non-allergic children (skin prick negative). Fluticasone decreased esophageal eosinophil levels more than the placebo in the proximal esophagus: (65.9 <U>+</U> 25.3 vs 1.4 <U>+</U> 1.1 eosinophils/hpf; P&lt;0.05), and in the distal esophagus (84.6 <U>+</U> 19.7 vs 19.6 <U>+</U> 12.9 eosinophils/hpf; P&lt;0.05). Fluticasone decreased vomiting more than the placebo (67% versus 27%), but did not decrease dysphagia, which is a more frequent symptom in adults.</P>
<P>In the trial comparing oral prednisone with topical (swallowed metered dose) fluticasone in children, the majority of the participants were symptom free at four weeks with no difference between the two groups. Symptom relapse usually occurred within six weeks of stopping therapy and had occurred in 45% of all trial participants at six month follow-up with no difference between treatment groups in the rate or timing of relapse. In the prednisone group, 40% had adverse effects and three children withdrew from the study before four weeks with severe adverse effects (hyperphagia, weight gain, cushingoid features). In the fluticasone group, 15% were diagnosed with<I> e</I>sophageal candidiasis and at week 24, 45% had a relapse in symptoms (<LINK REF="STD-Schaefer-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Schaefer 2008</LINK>). In one small trial, there was greater reduction in esophageal eosinophils with mepolizumab compared to placebo (67% vs 25%) but there was no difference in symptom response (<LINK REF="STD-Straumann-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Straumann 2008</LINK>).</P>

<P>Steroids are often used to treat EE and several uncontrolled studies (<LINK REF="REF-Furuta-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Furuta 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bohm-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bohm 2008)</LINK> indicate that they may improve histological abnormalities and clinical symptoms. Case series have reported treatment with metered dose steroids (<LINK REF="REF-Faubion-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Faubion 1998</LINK>), oral corticosteroids (<LINK REF="REF-Liacouras-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liacouras 1998</LINK>). The more recent use of topical steroids (fluticasone propionate or beclomethasone), administered by a metered-dose inhaler and swallowed, has been reported in uncontrolled studies with differing effectiveness for the initial treatment for EE and few adverse effects (<LINK REF="REF-Furuta-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Furuta 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bohm-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bohm 2008</LINK>). There is little evidence on the long-term use of topical or oral steroids, and some studies indicate that discontinuation of steroids often results in relapse. The only two RCTs evaluating steroids are both in children, one of which compared fluticasone with placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Konikoff-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Konikoff 2006</LINK>) and one which compared oral prednisone with swallowed fluticasone (<LINK REF="STD-Schaefer-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Schaefer 2008</LINK>). The presentation of EE differs considerably in children and adults and thus these results may not be applicable to adults. In the third RCT included in this review, mepolizumab was compared with placebo in adults (<LINK REF="STD-Straumann-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Straumann 2008</LINK>).</P>

<P>A range of pharmacological therapies has been used to treat EE, including oral and inhaled (swallowed) corticosteroids, sodium chromoglycate, proton pump inhibitors, montelukast (a leukotriene inhibiter), and mepolizumab (an IL-5 monoclonal antibody).  Dietary interventions include restricted or elemental diets but none has been tested in a RCT. No trials evaluating dietary interventions, including exclusion and hypoallergenic diets (<LINK REF="REF-Kelly-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kelly 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Markowitz-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Markowitz 2003</LINK>), have been evaluated by RCT.</P>
<P>Currently, there are insufficient RCTs to form a strong evidence base for practice. Two of the RCTs were conducted in children and evaluated the role of steroids (<LINK REF="STD-Konikoff-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Konikoff 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schaefer-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Schaefer 2008</LINK>), but used different criteria for the diagnostic of EE, for inclusion of trial participants and for determining histological response and neither evaluated long term maintenance therapy. There is only one small RCT (N=11) evaluating a novel therapy in adults with EE (<LINK REF="STD-Straumann-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Straumann 2008</LINK>).</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2010-02-12 07:17:09 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>At present a wide variety of interventions are used to treat EE, but few are based on high quality evidence. The AGA guidelines on management of EE in children and adults identify our lack of understanding of the pathophysiology of EE and the lack of universally accepted criteria for the diagnosis and treatment of EE (<LINK REF="REF-Furuta-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Furuta 2007</LINK>). Yet the frequency of EE is increasing and it is recognised as a chronic disease. A recent retrospective review of 89 children with EE supports the observation that EE is both chronic and relapsing: 79% of the 66% who initially responded to treatment had relapsed within the eight year follow-up period (<LINK REF="REF-Assa_x0027_ad-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Assa'ad 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>We identified only three RCTs evaluating medical treatments for EE and all had methodological limitations. The trial of fluticasone versus placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Konikoff-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Konikoff 2006</LINK>) supports the use of fluticasone for EE in children but highlights the high proportion of potential non-responders. The lack of improvement in dysphagia in this study may reflect the small sample size and the fact that this symptom is more common in adults, but raises the possibility that the results may not easily extrapolate to adults.</P>
<P>The trial comparing oral and metered dose steroids (<LINK REF="STD-Schaefer-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Schaefer 2008</LINK>) shows that both are effective as treatment for EE. A possible confounder is the fact that 58% of participants who tested positive for food allergies prior to commencing the study were asked to eliminate the relevant food during the trial. Although the proportion receiving a special diet was similar in each group, it is possible that benefits of the diet resulted in an overestimation of the beneficial effect of both medications. In view of the similar effectiveness of the two steroid preparations and the potential adverse effects of oral steroids documented in this RCT, inhaled (swallowed) steroids should be used in preference to oral steroids as initial treatment for uncomplicated EE.</P>
<P>Although the trial comparing mepolizumab with placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Straumann-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Straumann 2008</LINK>), which was a pilot study, indicated that treatment with mepolizumab resulted in an improved histological response, there was symptomatic improvement only in a small subgroup of two participants, with the symptoms of one participant improving in the placebo group.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2010-02-11 07:33:28 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>More highly powered RCTs are required to evaluate the efficacy, in the short, medium and long term, of the range of non-surgical therapies currently used for EE, including pharmacological and non-pharmacological (dietary) interventions.  Although this review identified three RCTs evaluating treatments for EE, these studies had methodological limitations, including small sample size. Furthermore, they used varying diagnostic and inclusion criteria for participants and different outcome measures. Universal diagnostic criteria for EE should be adopted and important relevant outcome measures standardised, so that the results of future RCTs on EE can be compared. Due to the high relapse rate of EE after stopping treatment, the long term use of treatments requires evaluation for efficacy and adverse effects. Because of the varying clinical characteristics of EE and the apparent variability of disease in young children, older children, and adults, participants in future trials should be well-described and analysis performed according to age.</P>

<P>There has been a minor adjustment in the importance attributed to some outcomes since the previous version, reflecting current knowledge on EE. The primary outcomes now include the decrease in the number of IEE, which was previously listed as a secondary outcome. Harms are also now included as a primary outcome, where previously they were included in the secondary outcomes. Other outcomes remain the same.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Measures of treatment effect  </HEADING>
<P>For dichotomous outcomes, we plan to express results as relative risk with 95% confidence intervals and to pool the data using a random effects model. Where continuous scales of measurement were used to assess the effects of treatment, we plan to use the weighted mean difference between groups with 95% confidence intervals. The standardised mean difference (with 95% confidence intervals) will be used to compare different measurement scales.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Data synthesis  </HEADING>
<P>Applicability of the results to individual patients will be expressed as relative risk reduction with therapy compared to the control.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Subgroup analysis</HEADING>
<P>We plan to perform subgroup analyses where adequate information is given in reports of studies.  The groups will be: age (18 years and under; over 18 years), allergy status (positive skin prick test; negative skin prick test), gender (male; female).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Investigation of heterogeneity</HEADING>
<P>If substantial heterogeneity exists between studies for the primary outcome, we shall explore the reasons for heterogeneity; such as age, cancer stage, histological type and treatment type. If it is inappropriate to pool the data because of clinical or statistical heterogeneity a systematic review without meta-analysis will be reported.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Sensitivity analysis  </HEADING>
<P>We plan to conduct sensitivity analyses to examine the effects of excluding studies defined as those with a moderate or high risk of bias as described in the Cochrane Handbook of Systematic Reviews of Interventions (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2008</LINK>).</P>
