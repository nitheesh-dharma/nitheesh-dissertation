<P>Weight reduction with different measures for treating non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is recommended, though this is not evidence-based. We performed this systematic review to investigate the beneficial and harmful effects of weight reduction with different measures for NAFLD patients, but we could not find firm evidence. Five trials on lifestyle programme and two trials on orlistat were obtained, and all but one had high risk of bias. There seemed to be some beneficial effects of lifestyle programme involving restricted diet and physical exercise for NAFLD patients. However, the data were sparse, and meta-analyses could not be performed. Well-designed randomised clinical trials are needed to establish the true effect of the weight reduction measures identified for our review. The long-term prognosis of development of fibrosis, mortality, and quality of life modified by weight reduction should be studied. Special attention should be paid to the amount of weight loss.</P>

<P>The review includes seven trials; five on aspects of lifestyle changes (eg, diet, physical exercise) and two on treatment with a weight reduction drug 'orlistat'. In total, 373 participants were enrolled, and the duration of the trials ranged from 1 month to 1 year. Only one trial on lifestyle programme was judged to be of low risk of bias. We could not perform meta-analyses for the main outcomes as they were either not reported or there were insufficient number of trials for each outcome to be meta-analysed. We could meta-analyse the available data for body weight and body mass index only. Adverse events were poorly reported.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2011-05-06 14:34:32 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Dimitrinka Nikolova">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2011-05-06 14:34:32 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Dimitrinka Nikolova">
<P>Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is an increasingly recognised condition that may progress to end-stage liver disease. The pathological picture resembles that of alcohol-induced liver injury, which ranges from simple steatosis to steatohepatitis (non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, NASH), advanced fibrosis, and even cirrhosis, but it occurs in people who do not abuse alcohol (<LINK REF="REF-Ludwig-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ludwig 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schaffner-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schaffner 1986</LINK>).</P>
<P>NAFLD affects 10% to 30% of the general population in developed countries, and the prevalence increases to 60% and 70% in obese persons in European, North America, and Asian countries (<LINK REF="REF-Nomura-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nomura 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Luyckx-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Luyckx 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bellentani-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bellentani 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lazo-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lazo 2008</LINK>). Steatosis is found in over two thirds of obese persons (<LINK REF="REF-Wanless-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wanless 1990</LINK>) and in more than 90% of morbidly obese persons (<LINK REF="REF-Silverman-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Silverman 1990</LINK>). Steatohepatitis affects about 20% of the obese population and almost half of the morbidly obese people (<LINK REF="REF-Silverman-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Silverman 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wanless-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wanless 1990</LINK>). NAFLD affects not only adults but also children. About 2% of children and 20% to 50% of obese children are affected (<LINK REF="REF-Tominaga-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tominaga 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Franzese-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Franzese 1997</LINK>). In several series of patients with NAFLD, the reported prevalence of obesity varied between 80% and 100% (<LINK REF="REF-Lee-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lee 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Manton-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Manton 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rashid-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rashid 2000</LINK>).<B> </B>Central obesity is an important risk factor for NAFLD, even in patients with a normal body mass index (BMI) (<LINK REF="REF-Ruderman-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ruderman 1998</LINK>). In the United States, obesity affects 20% to 25% of the adult population (<LINK REF="REF-Clark-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clark 2003</LINK>). Hence, NAFLD is probably the most prevalent disorder of the liver in high-income countries and its frequency is increasing in populations that are becoming more westernised.</P>
<P>Initially, NAFLD was considered to be a benign disorder, but it is now believed that it progresses to advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis in as many as 25% of the individuals (<LINK REF="REF-Lee-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lee 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Powell-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Powell 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Adams-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Adams 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Feldstein-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Feldstein 2009</LINK>). This condition is thought to be the predominant cause of cryptogenic cirrhosis (<LINK REF="REF-Caldwell-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Caldwell 1999</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2011-04-09 10:27:25 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Interventions to reduce body weight include lifestyle modifications, pharmacological treatments, and surgical interventions. Lifestyle modifications consist of dietary change (calorie restriction) and physical exercise (at least 60 minutes daily for at least 5 days per week). These efforts may be facilitated with behavioural and cognitive strategies. Adherence to established intervention is critical (<LINK REF="REF-Bellentani-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bellentani 2008</LINK>). Behavioural modifications have been extensively applied in the treatment of obesity and associated metabolic diseases. Both the Finnish Diabetes Prevention Study (<LINK REF="REF-Tuomilehto-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tuomilehto 2001</LINK>) and the U.S. Diabetes Prevention Program (<LINK REF="REF-Knowler-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Knowler 2002</LINK>) have shown that behavioural therapy is much more effective than usual care or metformin treatment in the prevention of diabetes in obese adults with prediabetes, and the beneficial effects are long lasting (<LINK REF="REF-Lindstrom-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lindstrom 2006</LINK>). Lifestyle modification was also effective in preventing diabetes in Asian Indians despite their relatively low body mass index and insulin resistance features (<LINK REF="REF-Ramachandran-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ramachandran 2006</LINK>). Given the above proof, one would expect such interventions to have a favourable impact on NAFLD and NASH.</P>
<P>Orlistat, phentermine, and sibutramine are the most commonly used FDA approved medications for treatment of obesity (<LINK REF="REF-Bouneva-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bouneva 2004</LINK>). However, their use, specifically for NAFLD, has been inadequately studied. Orlistat has received the most attention (<LINK REF="REF-Sabuncu-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sabuncu 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zelber_x002d_Sagi-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Zelber-Sagi 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hussein-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hussein 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Harrison-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Harrison 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>Surgery for obesity reliably achieves and sustains substantial weight loss. Presently, the two procedures most commonly employed are laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB) and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB). A third procedure, biliopancreatic diversion (BPD) along with its duodenal switch variant (BPD-DS) are used less frequently (<LINK REF="REF-Buchwald-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Buchwald 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Demaria-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Demaria 2005</LINK>). Jejunoilieal bypass (JIB) had been abandoned because it can induce progressive liver disease (<LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Leary-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Leary 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hocking-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hocking 1998</LINK>). A substantial weight loss following gastroplasty is accompanied by a marked reduction in the prevalence and the severity of the various biological abnormalities of the metabolic syndrome (<LINK REF="REF-Buchwald-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Buchwald 2004</LINK>). A majority of patients with diabetes, hyperlipidaemia, hypertension, and obstructive sleep apnoea experienced complete resolution or improvement. So regression of liver steatosis in obese patients could also be anticipated.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2010-05-12 14:50:11 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Dimitrinka Nikolova">
<P>A 'two-hit' hypothesis has been proposed to explain the pathogenesis of NAFLD and NASH (<LINK REF="REF-Day-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Day 1998</LINK>). Obesity and insulin-resistance precede the development of NAFLD (<LINK REF="REF-Suzuki-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Suzuki 2005</LINK>).The 'first hit' arises from these conditions resulting in triglyceride accumulation in hepatocytes (<LINK REF="REF-Chitturi-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chitturi 2002</LINK>). The 'second hit' occurs when inflammation emerges and progresses after the 'first hit'. So, we hypothesise that weight reduction could stop the 'first hit' and thus halt the subsequent pathogenic process.<BR/>
</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2011-03-03 10:56:19 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In principle, weight reduction is a promising treatment strategy for NAFLD and NASH (<LINK REF="REF-Busetto-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Busetto 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Riley-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Riley 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-van-der-Poorten-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">van der Poorten 2008</LINK>). However, a hypothesis is not evidence of efficacy. Since the amounts of resources are being expanded on inducing weight loss in patients with NAFLD or NASH, it is important to clarify the precise effects of weight reduction (diet with or without exercise, drug, or surgical therapy). We found a meta-analysis of randomised trials for the treatment of NAFLD (<LINK REF="REF-Musso-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Musso 2010</LINK>). However, it does not specifically answer the question of our study, which aimed at investigating the effect of intended weight reduction with different measures in comparison with placebo or untreated control group in randomised clinical trials.</P>

<P>We included randomised clinical trials that fulfilled the inclusion criteria of this review. We only included trials with a placebo or untreated control group. Trials that compared one treatment intervention to another but did not contain a placebo or untreated group were excluded. Where a trial involved more than one treatment intervention, different interventions were analysed separately in relevant comparisons. We planned to use data from the first phase of cross-over studies as advised by the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). Quasi-randomised clinical studies, cohort studies, and historical controlled studies were excluded. However, we used the quasi-randomised studies that came up with the search result to collect data on the adverse events that they might have reported. Randomised clinical trials were included irrespective of publication status, date of publication, or language.</P>

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2011-05-10 13:37:51 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Sarah L Klingenberg">
<P>The methodological quality of the trials, and hence risk of bias, was assessed based on the following domains (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moher-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kjaergard-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kjaergard 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wood-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wood 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gluud-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gluud 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). The assessment was made for each trial in separate.</P>
<P>
<B>Allocation sequence generation</B>
<BR/>- Low risk of bias: sequence generation was achieved using computer random number generation or a random number table. Drawing lots, tossing a coin, shuffling cards and throwing dice are adequate if performed by an independent adjudicator.<BR/>- Uncertain risk of bias: the trial was described as randomised, but the method of sequence generation was not specified.<BR/>- High risk of bias: the sequence generation method was not, or may not be, random. Quasi-randomised studies, those using dates, names, or admittance numbers in order to allocate patients are inadequate and were excluded for the assessment of benefits but not for harms.<BR/>
<BR/>
<B>Allocation concealment</B>
<BR/>- Low risk of bias: allocation was controlled by a central and independent randomisation unit, sequentially numbered, opaque and sealed envelopes or similar, so that intervention allocations could not have been foreseen in advance of, or during, enrolment.<BR/>- Uncertain risk of bias: the trial was described as randomised but the method used to conceal the allocation was not described, so that intervention allocations may have been foreseen in advance of, or during, enrolment.<BR/>- High risk of bias: if the allocation sequence was known to the investigators who assigned participants or if the study was quasi-randomised. Quasi-randomised studies were excluded for the assessment of benefits but not for harms.<BR/>
<BR/>
<B>Blinding</B>
<BR/>- Low risk of bias: the trial was described as blinded, the parties that were blinded, and the method of blinding was described, so that knowledge of allocation was adequately prevented during the trial.<BR/>- Uncertain risk of bias: the trial was described as blind, but the method of blinding was not described, so that knowledge of allocation was possible during the trial.<BR/>- High risk of bias, the trial was not blinded, so that the allocation was known during the trial.</P>
<P>
<B>Incomplete outcome data</B>
<BR/>- Low risk of bias: the numbers and reasons for dropouts and withdrawals in all intervention groups were described or if it was specified that there were no dropouts or withdrawals.<BR/>- Uncertain risk of bias: the report gave the impression that there had been no dropouts or withdrawals, but this was not specifically stated.<BR/>- High risk of bias: the number or reasons for dropouts and withdrawals were not described.</P>
<P>
<B>Selective outcome reporting</B>
<BR/>- Low risk of bias: pre-defined, or clinically relevant and reasonably expected outcomes were reported on.<BR/>- Uncertain risk of bias: not all pre-defined, or clinically relevant and reasonably expected outcomes were reported on or were not reported fully, or it is unclear whether data on these outcomes were recorded or not.<BR/>- High risk of bias: one or more clinically relevant and reasonably expected outcomes were not reported on; data on these outcomes were likely to have been recorded.</P>
<P>
<B>Other biases</B>
</P>
<P>
<B>Commercial support</B>
<BR/>- Low risk of bias: the trial had no commercial support.<BR/>- Uncertain risk of bias: the trial had some commercial support, and we are not sure whether an important risk of bias existed.<BR/>- High risk of bias: the trial had some commercial support, and we judge that an important risk of bias was introduced.</P>
<P>Trials assessed as having 'low risk of bias' in all of the above individual domains were considered trials with 'low risk of bias'. Trials assessed as having 'uncertain risk of bias' or 'high risk of bias' in one or more of the above specified domains were considered trials with 'high risk of bias'.</P>

<P>1. Mortality.<BR/>None of the included trials on lifestyle programme reported on mortality.</P>

<P>3. Histological alterations.<BR/>Only one trial reported this outcome (<LINK REF="STD-Promrat-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Promrat 2010</LINK>). In this trial, the histological scoring criteria (<LINK REF="REF-Kleiner-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kleiner 2005</LINK>) by the NASH Clinical Research Network was used. The mean reduction of overall disease activity of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NAS) was 2.4 (standard deviation (SD) = 1.6) in the lifestyle intervention group and 1.4 (SD = 2.1) in the control group, respectively (P = 0.05). Steatosis score also improved to a significantly greater degree in the lifestyle group (mean reduction = 1.1, SD = 0.8) as compared with the control group (mean reduction = 0.3, SD = 0.8) (P = 0.02). The intervention did not result in any significant change in the fibrosis score (1.4 to 1.4 in the lifestyle group, and 1.7 to 1.4 in the control group, P = 0.62). The changes in parenchymal inflammation and ballooning injury scores did not differ significantly between the two groups either.<BR/>

<P>5. Other liver tests.</P>
<P>5.1. Blood tests - alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT), and bilirubin.<BR/>Four trials (<LINK REF="STD-Wang-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Johnson-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Johnson 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lazo-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Lazo 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Promrat-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Promrat 2010</LINK>) reported blood tests (ALT and AST). ALT was reduced in two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Wang-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Promrat-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Promrat 2010</LINK>). AST was reduced in one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Wang-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2008</LINK>). No elevation of ALT and AST was reported in these trials. Meta-analyses for ALT and AST were not performed because of the high heterogeneity ( I<SUP>2 </SUP>&gt; 90%). In <LINK REF="STD-Promrat-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Promrat 2010</LINK>, the ALT level was changed from 84 U/L to 42 U/L in the lifestyle group and from 86 U/L to 69 U/L in the control group (P = 0.01). There was no statistical difference of AST reduction between the lifestyle group (57 U/L to 37 U/L) and the control group (66 U/L to 48 U/L) (P = 0.11). In <LINK REF="STD-Wang-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2008</LINK>, the mean ALT level was reduced from 152.26 U/L to 63.68 U/L in the lifestyle group (P = 0) and from 144.77 U/L to 144.82 U/L in the control group (P = 0.94). The mean AST level was reduced from 93.26 U/L to 45.09 U/L in the lifestyle group (P = 0) and from 86.63 U/L to 85.73 U/L in the control group (P = 0.316). In <LINK REF="STD-Lazo-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Lazo 2010</LINK>, the median ALT level was changed from 17.5 U/L to 20 U/L in the lifestyle group and from 20 U/L to 19 U/L in the control group (P = 0.31), and the median AST level was changed from 18 U/L to 21 U/L in the lifestyle group and from 19 U/L to 17 U/L in the control group (P = 0.45). In <LINK REF="STD-Johnson-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Johnson 2009</LINK>, the mean ALT level was changed from 35.7 U/L to 32.9 U/L in the lifestyle group and from 37.7 U/L to 38.4 U/L in the control group (P = 0.16).</P>
<P>5.2. Radiological examinations - ultrasound, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging.</P>
<P>Liver ultrasound was used in <LINK REF="STD-Wang-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2008</LINK>. It was reported that the liver ultrasonography did not demonstrate any predominant changes in any group.</P>

All these trials showed an association between lifestyle programme and improved steatosis condition. In <LINK REF="STD-Bonekamp-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Bonekamp 2008</LINK>, the exercise intervention was associated with a 2.5% (P = 0.003) reduction in hepatic fat, and this decrease remained unchanged after adjustment for changes in body composition, lipids, and HbA1c. In <LINK REF="STD-Johnson-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Johnson 2009</LINK>, mean hepatic lipid content was significantly reduced from 8.55% to 6.79% in the exercise group and increased from 9.18% to 9.44% in the placebo group (P = 0.042). In <LINK REF="STD-Lazo-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Lazo 2010</LINK>, the 12-month median absolute change in steatosis in the lifestyle group was more than double than that in the control group (-2.3% versus -1.1%, P = 0.04). The median per cent decrease and interquartile range in steatosis was -50.8% (-66.9% to -27.8%) in the lifestyle group and -22.8% (-51.2% to 32.2%) in the control group, respectively (P = 0.04).</P>

The lifestyle intervention also resulted in a significant decrease in BMI (2.6 kg/m<SUP>2 </SUP>versus 0.03 kg/m<SUP>2</SUP>, P &lt; 0.001). In <LINK REF="STD-Promrat-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Promrat 2010</LINK>, the mean weight was changed from 98.9 kg to 90.2 kg in the lifestyle intervention group and was changed from 102.9 kg to 102.4 kg in the control group over the 48-week period (P = 0.005). BMI was reduced from 33.6 kg/m<SUP>2 </SUP>to 30.6 kg/m<SUP>2</SUP> in the lifestyle intervention group and from 33.7 kg/m<SUP>2 </SUP>to 33.6 kg/m<SUP>2</SUP> in the control group (P = 0.004). In <LINK REF="STD-Wang-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2008</LINK>, BMI was reduced significantly from 29.61 kg/m<SUP>2 </SUP>to 27.18 kg/m<SUP>2 </SUP>in the lifestyle group (P = 0) and was changed from 29.81 kg/m<SUP>2 </SUP>to 29.83 kg/m<SUP>2</SUP> in the control group (P = 0.74). In the other two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Bonekamp-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Bonekamp 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Johnson-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Johnson 2009</LINK>), the mean body weight or BMI had no significant changes after the lifestyle intervention. The meta-analysis showed that body weight at the end of the trial in the lifestyle group was not significantly different from that in the control group (MD -8.27, 95% CI -18.89 to 2.35; 3 trials, n = 145). The analysis for BMI showed that BMI in the lifestyle group at the end of the trial was lower than that in the control group (MD -2.18, 95% CI -3.17 to -1.20; 4 trials, n = 202).</P>

Only the difference of mean ALT reduction was reported to be significant between the orlistat group and the control group (-30.6 U/L versus -12.7 U/L), but the P value was not specified.</P>
<P>5.2. Radiological examinations - ultrasound, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging.</P>
<P>Liver ultrasound was used in one study (<LINK REF="STD-Zelber_x002d_Sagi-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Zelber-Sagi 2006</LINK>). The analysis showed that the reversibility of fatty liver under ultrasound examination was not enhanced by orlistat therapy (OR 1.48, 95% CI 0.34 to 6.48; 1 trial, n = 44) (<LINK REF="CMP-002.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.1</LINK>). Sensitivity analyses assuming the best-case and worst-case scenarios did not change the significance (<LINK REF="CMP-002.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.2</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-002.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.3</LINK>).</P>
<P>6. Body weight and BMI.<BR/>Body weight and BMI were studied in both included trials. In <LINK REF="STD-Harrison-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Harrison 2009</LINK>, the changes of body weight and BMI were not significantly different between the two groups. Mean body weight was reduced from 226 pounds to 208 pounds in the orlistat group and from 224 pounds to 210 pounds in the control group (P = 0.86). Mean BMI was reduced from 37.3 kg/m<SUP>2 </SUP>to 34.5 kg/m<SUP>2 </SUP>in the orlistat group and from 35.2 kg/m<SUP>2 </SUP>to 32.6 kg/m<SUP>2</SUP> in the control group (P = 0.36). In <LINK REF="STD-Zelber_x002d_Sagi-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Zelber-Sagi 2006</LINK>, the mean weight loss was 7.7 (SD = 6.8) kg in the orlistat group compared with 5.9 (SD = 5.9) kg in the placebo group (P &lt; 0.01). BMI decreased significantly within each group with no significant difference between the two groups (P = 0.26).</P>

<P>Subgroup analyses, funnel plot analyses, and the remaining sensitivity analyses were not performed due to the limited data.</P>
<P>In addition to the comparisons between treatment groups on histological outcomes of NAFLD, two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Harrison-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Harrison 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Promrat-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Promrat 2010</LINK>) also made comparisons for incremental weight loss which may make the relation between weight loss and outcomes of NAFLD clearer and more direct. In one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Harrison-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Harrison 2009</LINK>), participants who lost more than 5% of body weight over nine months improved steatosis, and those participants who lost more than 9% also achieved improved hepatic histological changes, like ballooning, inflammation, and NAS. In the other trial, participants who achieved the trial goal for weight loss of more than 7% compared with those who lost less than 7%, also had significant improvements in steatosis, lobular inflammation, ballooning injury, and NAS (<LINK REF="STD-Promrat-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Promrat 2010</LINK>).<BR/>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2011-05-06 14:34:32 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Dimitrinka Nikolova">
<P>In this review, we could include seven randomised clinical trials in total; five on lifestyle programme and two on orlistat. Only one trial on lifestyle programme had low risk of bias. Randomisation was not clearly described in five of the trials. The duration of the trials was generally short. Three hundred and seventy-three participants were enrolled. We could not perform meta-analyses for the main outcomes as they either were not reported adequately or there were insufficient number of trials for each outcome to be meta-analysed. The results in the trials showed some beneficial effects of lifestyle programme for NAFLD patients. Adverse events were poorly reported, but the tested interventions seemed safe for the patients. Mortality and quality of life were not evaluated in any trial. The scant data and the high risk of bias did not allow us to draw any conclusion on the beneficial or harmful effects of lifestyle programme and orlistat.</P>
<P>Though we could not find firm evidence, the identified trials for this review represent the current available evidence on the beneficial and harmful effects of weight reduction for NAFLD. There are also reviews published on the topic (<LINK REF="REF-Wang-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wang 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Blackburn-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blackburn 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Clark-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clark 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Dixon-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dixon 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Harrison-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harrison 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bellentani-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bellentani 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-de-Freitas-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">de Freitas 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mummadi-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mummadi 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rafiq-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rafiq 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Chavez_x002d_Tapia-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chavez-Tapia 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Musso-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Musso 2010</LINK>). Overall, no conclusions obtained so far have denied the possible beneficial effect of weight reduction for NAFLD. In our work, unlike previous publications, we took weight reduction as an intended intervention and tried to investigate the effect of weight loss based on high-quality randomised clinical trials with a placebo or untreated control group. The work has given us some valuable evidence about the recommended treatment strategy for NAFLD patients. The recent well-designed randomised clinical trial in NASH patients testing the effects of weight loss showed that a one-year period of lifestyle adjustment resulted in a 7% to 10% weight loss with significant histological improvement of liver disease (<LINK REF="STD-Promrat-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Promrat 2010</LINK>). Of course, more trials with low risk of bias are still needed to evaluate the exact effect of weight reduction.</P>
<P>It may take many years for a patient with NAFLD to develop cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, and eventually die. In this review, the follow-up in the included trials was on average seven months. The sample size was small. There was no data on assessment of potential long-term fibrosis response to weight loss. It remains to be determined whether these treatments are able to modify the natural history of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease like mortality in the long term. Future trials should take these into consideration. Quality of life as an important aspect of patients care should also be of concern.</P>
<P>Our review showed that orlistat therapy had induced no more loss of body weight than placebo. However, in <LINK REF="STD-Harrison-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Harrison 2009</LINK>, after stratifying the participants according to weight loss instead of treatment groups, the participants with more weight loss had significant improvements compared with those participants who lost less weight. This is in accordance with the findings of another study by <LINK REF="STD-Promrat-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Promrat 2010</LINK> on lifestyle programme. Though this may betray the original randomisation, this kind of analysis indeed showed an association between weight loss and improved outcomes of the liver disease. Substantial weight loss could improve liver histology irrespective of the intervention measures. It seems the point is whether participants in the intervention group achieved substantial weight loss or not. So, the amount of weight loss or the accurate efficiency of weight reduction should be paid more attention to during implementation of weight-reduction measures. It is also necessary to note that histological outcomes are intermediate or surrogate ones. Whether changes in these outcomes could translate into changes in clinical outcomes such as mortality or morbidity needs to be evaluated.<BR/>

<P>The data currently available precludes us from drawing any unbiased conclusion on lifestyle programme or orlistat for treatment of NAFLD. Even that primary evidence has indicated some beneficial effects of lifestyle programme for NAFLD patients, and it seems to be a safe measure for treatment of NAFLD patients, we think that more randomised trials shall be performed before making any implications. Special attention should be paid to the exact weight loss obtained when implementing the interventions.<BR/>

<P>We removed 'surgical interventions intended to produce weight loss' from 'types of interventions' because this intervention was addressed in a recent Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-Chavez_x002d_Tapia-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chavez-Tapia 2010</LINK>). We also removed 'placebo or no intervention' from 'types of interventions' because this may lead to a misunderstanding. We had taken this item in the control group as one kind of intervention. We added that co-interventions irrelevant to the intended interventions were allowed if received by all intervention groups. We added quality of life as an evaluated outcome in the review though we did not specify this in the protocol.</P>
