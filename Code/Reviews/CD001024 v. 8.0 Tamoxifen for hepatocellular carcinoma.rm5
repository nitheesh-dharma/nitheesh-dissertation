<SUMMARY>
<TITLE>Tamoxifen does not improve survival in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Hepatocellular carcinoma (primary liver cancer) is a common cause of death from cancer world-wide. It is usually fatal in patients who cannot be treated with surgery or other local treatments. Tamoxifen is an anti-oestrogen drug, which has been tested in advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. The reviewers identified 10 trials assessing the effect of tamoxifen on survival, quality of life, tumour size, and treatment side effects in advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. Tamoxifen had no significant effect on survival or tumour size. Tamoxifen did not improve quality of life. </P>
</SUMMARY_BODY>
</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Hepatocellular carcinoma (primary liver cancer) is the third commonest cause of cancer mortality world-wide. Survival is poor for patients with advanced disease. Trials of tamoxifen for hepatocellular carcinoma have conflicting results. </P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To conduct a systematic review of the literature to assess the effect of tamoxifen on overall survival, quality-of-life, tumour response, and treatment toxicity in people with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. </P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>We identified trials from <I>The Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register </I>(January 2004), <I>The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials</I> on <I>The Cochrane Library </I>(Issue 3, 2003), and <I>MEDLINE</I> database (1966 to November 2003). We searched bibliographies of review articles and identified trials, and hand-searched abstracts from relevant other meetings.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>All randomised clinical trials of treatment with tamoxifen compared to a control treatment without tamoxifen in people with hepatocellular carcinoma, including trials of tamoxifen versus placebo, tamoxifen versus best supportive care, and tamoxifen plus other treatment versus the same other treatment alone.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Three independent reviewers selected studies for inclusion, rated them for methodologic quality components (generation of allocation sequence; allocation concealment; blinding; and follow-up), and extracted data on the specified outcomes. Hazard ratios were derived for overall survival where possible. Meta-analysis was performed using a fixed-effect model. </P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Ten randomised trials randomising 1709 patients were included. Tamoxifen versus placebo/no intervention had no significant effect on overall survival (hazard ratio 1.05; 95% CI 0.94 to 1.16; P = 0.4). This comparison showed no statistical heterogeneity (P = 0.2 and I<SUP>2 </SUP> = 25.9%). Subgroup analysis showed that tamoxifen tended to increase mortality in trials with three adequate/three methodological components (hazard ratio 1.15; 95% CI 0.99 to 1.34; P = 0.06), showed no significant effect in trials with two adequate/three methodological components (hazard ratio 1.00; 95% CI 0.84 to 1.18; P = 0.98), and tended to reduce mortality in trials with one or less adequate/three methodological components (hazard ratio 0.82; 95% CI 0.60 to 1.12; P = 0.2), although this may have been confounded by the use of higher doses of tamoxifen in the better quality trials. Tamoxifen was associated with adverse effects. One trial measured patient quality of life, but the results were not reported in detail.<BR/> </P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>These data do not support the use of tamoxifen for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. Further research on the effects of tamoxifen in hepatocellular carcinoma does not seem warranted.</P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>

<BODY MODIFIED="2008-11-10 01:11:55 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND>
<P>World-wide, hepatocellular carcinoma (primary liver cancer) is one of the commonest causes of death from malignant disease. Although less common in western populations, it is a significant cause of death in eastern Asia and sub-Saharan Africa (<LINK REF="REF-Murray-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Murray 1997</LINK>). Most cases are associated with cirrhosis, predominantly due to chronic infections with hepatitis B and hepatitis C viruses, alcohol, aflatoxin or haemochromatosis.<BR/> <BR/>People with hepatocellular carcinoma generally present with advanced disease. High-risk populations have recently been targeted for screening, but the outlook remains poor for most stages of the disease (<LINK REF="REF-Okuda-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Okuda 1985</LINK>). A variety of therapeutic modalities have been used in these patients (<LINK REF="REF-Lotze-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lotze 1993</LINK>). </P>
<P>Surgery for early stage disease has given some long-term survivors; however the wide applicability of resection is often limited by the poor synthetic function of the cirrhotic liver. </P>
<P>A variety of cytotoxic agents have been used in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. Tumour response rates with systemically administered cytotoxic drugs are generally low, although they maybe slightly higher with regional administration with or without embolization. Any benefit from cytotoxic therapy must be weighed against the associated toxicity.</P>
<P>Based on the finding that some hepatocellular carcinomas have oestrogen receptors (<LINK REF="REF-Nagasue-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nagasue 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jonas-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jonas 1997</LINK>) several trials have been conducted of the antioestrogen tamoxifen. The earliest trials were small and had conflicting results. While tamoxifen has been used in both women and men with hepatocellular cancer, its putative mode of action raises the question of whether its effects differ between women and men.</P>
<P>There have been three systematic reviews of randomised clinical trials of treatments for hepatocellular carcinoma (<LINK REF="REF-Simonetti-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Simonetti 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mathurin-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mathurin 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Llovet-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Llovet 2003</LINK>). Whilst the two earlier reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Simonetti-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Simonetti 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mathurin-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mathurin 1998</LINK>) showed a marginal increase in survival with the use of tamoxifen in advanced hepatocellular carcinoma, both noted that further large, well-designed trials were needed to answer this question. The most recent review did not show any survival benefit or anti-tumour effect for tamoxifen (<LINK REF="REF-Llovet-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Llovet 2003</LINK>), and the authors noted that only the low-quality trials showed any benefits. The current review extends the search beyond <I>MEDLINE</I> and adds larger, more recent trials.</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>Primary objective: to conduct a systematic review of the literature to assess the effect of tamoxifen on overall survival in people with hepatocellular carcinoma. </P>
<P>Secondary objectives: to assess the effects of tamoxifen on quality-of-life, tumour response, and treatment toxicity, and in addition, to assess whether there is an interaction between gender and the effects of tamoxifen on overall survival or response rate.</P>
</OBJECTIVES>
<METHODS MODIFIED="2008-11-10 01:11:55 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<CRIT_STUDIES>
<P>Only randomised clinical trials of treatment with tamoxifen compared to a control treatment without tamoxifen in people with hepatocellular carcinoma were reviewed. This included randomised clinical trials of tamoxifen versus placebo, tamoxifen versus best supportive care, and tamoxifen plus other treatment versus the same other treatment alone. Trials were included regardless of blinding, publication status (full publication or abstract), and language. Trials in which patients were allocated by a quasi-random method eg, day of birth or date of admission, were excluded.</P>
</CRIT_STUDIES>
<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>Patients with a diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma according to the definitions of the individual trials. Trials with no explicit definitions were also included. The presence of hepatocellular carcinoma was defined by either histology or cytology in some trials. Studies including patients with a clinical diagnosis (e.g., typical imaging, raised alpha-fetoprotein [alpha-fetoprotein more than five times the upper limit of normal] and a history of chronic liver disease) but without histologic/cytologic confirmation were also included.</P>
<P>Trials recruiting patients with apparently resected disease (testing tamoxifen as an adjuvant treatment) and trials recruiting patients with advanced/unresectable disease (testing tamoxifen as treatment for advanced disease) were both eligible for inclusion; analyses were to be stratified according to the stage of disease.</P>
</CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>Tamoxifen at any dose and for any duration used alone or in combination with other treatments versus placebo, no intervention, best supportive care, or the same control treatment without tamoxifen. </P>
</CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<CRIT_OUTCOMES>
<P>The following outcomes were assessed in all included studies where possible:</P>
<P>The primary outcome measure was:<BR/>(1) Overall survival (time from date randomised to date of death (any cause)). <BR/>The secondary outcome measures were:<BR/>(1) Quality of life<BR/>(2) Tumour response (complete responses + partial responses, as defined as a greater than or equal to a 50% reduction in the sums of products of perpendicular diameters)<BR/>(3) Treatment toxicity, defined as the proportions of individuals with greater than grade two toxicity, both according standard World Health Organisation criteria (<LINK REF="REF-Miller-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Miller 1981</LINK>).</P>
<P>There was no restriction to English language publications.</P>

<SEARCH_METHODS MODIFIED="2008-11-10 01:11:55 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Trials were identified by searching <I>The Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register</I> (January 2004), <I>The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials</I> on <I>The Cochrane Library </I>(Issue 3, 2003), and <I>MEDLINE</I> (1966 to November Week 2 2003). The search strategies used by The Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group for their specialised register include hand searching of relevant abstracts of scientific meetings and are described in the group's module on The Cochrane Library. We applied the search strategies as described in <LINK REF="APP-01" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 1</LINK>. In addition, abstracts from the Annual Scientific Meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology were hand searched (1996 to 2003). References of review articles and identified trials were also searched but did not identify further trials. Study investigators were also contacted, but did not identify any other trials.</P>

<B>Trial selection and quality assessment</B>
<BR/>Three reviewers independently selected trials for inclusion with disagreements resolved by discussion.</P>
<P>Methodologic quality was assessed independently by three reviewers (MS, MF, and either GV or AN) to assess how well the study design minimised the potential for biases due to differences between treatment groups. Methodological quality (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moher-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kjaergard-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kjaergard 2001</LINK>) was assessed by the following components</P>
<P>Generation of the allocation sequence<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Adequate, if the allocation sequence was generated by a computer or random number table. Drawing of lots, tossing of a coin, shuffling of cards, or throwing dice will be considered as adequate if a person who was not otherwise involved in the recruitment of participants performed the procedure;</LI>
<LI>Unclear, if the trial was described as randomised, but the method used for the allocation sequence generation was not described;</LI>
<LI>Inadequate, if a system involving dates, names, or admittance numbers were used for the allocation of patients.</LI>
</UL>
<P>Allocation concealment<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Adequate, if the allocation of patients involved a central independent unit, on-site locked computer, identically appearing numbered drug bottles or containers prepared by an independent pharmacist or investigator, or sealed envelopes;</LI>
<LI>Unclear, if the trial was described as randomised, but the method used to conceal the allocation was not described;</LI>
<LI>Inadequate, if the allocation sequence was known to the investigators who assigned participants or if the study was quasi-randomised.</LI>
</UL>
<P>Blinding (or masking)<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Adequate, if the trial was described as double blind and the method of blinding involved identical placebo or active drugs;</LI>
<LI>Unclear, if the trial was described as double blind, but the method of blinding was not described;</LI>
<LI>Not performed, if the trial was not double blind.</LI>
</UL>
<P>Follow-up<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Adequate, if the numbers and reasons for dropouts and withdrawals in all intervention groups were described or if it was specified that there were no dropouts or withdrawals;</LI>
<LI>Unclear, if the report gave the impression that there had been no dropouts or withdrawals, but this was not specifically stated;</LI>
<LI>Inadequate, if the number or reasons for dropouts and withdrawals were not described.</LI>
</UL>
<P>Trials were also assessed according to whether the analysis was by intention to treat, and according to whether details of sample size calculations were given. Individual investigators were asked in writing to clarify important issues which were not clear from the published reports, for example, whether or not there was adequate concealment of treatment allocation. Disagreements were resolved by discussion.</P>
<P>
<B>Data extraction<BR/>
</B>Three reviewers extracted data from reports using standardised forms with disagreements resolved by discussion. Survival data were obtained indirectly using the methods described by Parmar et al by recording actuarial survival proportions at pre-determined time points from Kaplan-Meier curves or tables (<LINK REF="REF-Parmar-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parmar 1998</LINK>). Censoring was accounted for by adjusting the numbers at risk based on estimated minimum and maximum follow-up times. Where follow-up times were not explicitly reported, we estimated the minimum follow-up as the interval from the date of study closure to six months prior to the date the manuscript was received by the journal; and, the maximum follow-up as the interval from the date of study commencement to six months prior to the date the manuscript was received.</P>
<P>In order to calculate an overall estimate of effect for each dose level, but avoid including the control group twice, the three-arm study (<LINK REF="STD-Chow-2002-120-mg" TYPE="STUDY">Chow 2002 120 mg</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chow-2002-60-mg" TYPE="STUDY">Chow 2002 60 mg</LINK>) was analysed using half the control group numbers as controls for each of the two experimental arms.</P>
<P>
<B>Statistical analyses<BR/>
</B>A fixed effect model was used to calculate a pooled hazard ratio for overall survival, using the derived observed (O) - expected (E) number of events and the variance obtained for each trial, using the method of Parmar et al (<LINK REF="REF-Parmar-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parmar 1998</LINK>). The 95% confidence intervals were calculated for individual and aggregate estimates of effect.</P>
<P>The stratification of analyses according to stage of disease (ie, post-resection versus advanced disease), inclusion criteria (ie, clinical versus histological or cytological) and gender was planned. We could not perform the stratification as there were insufficient data for the analyses.</P>
<P>Sensitivity analyses were used to assess the effects of inclusion or exclusion of trials published solely as abstracts and trials of low quality. We also performed subgroup analyses according to the number of adequate components (generation of the allocation sequence; allocation concealment; double blinding) in each trial, and the dose of tamoxifen in each trial. These components were chosen as it has previously been demonstrated that trials with inadequacies in these components tend to overestimate intervention effects (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moher-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kjaergard-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kjaergard 2001</LINK>). We used the test of interaction (<LINK REF="REF-Altman-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Altman 2003</LINK>) to compare the difference between estimates in subgroup analyses. We also assessed the presence of publication or other biases through funnel plot analysis.</P>

</METHODS>
<RESULTS>
<STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<P>We identified 19 potentially eligible trials and included 10. The reasons for excluding nine trials were: non-randomised allocation to treatment and control groups (<LINK REF="STD-Farinati-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Farinati 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Farinati-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Farinati 1992</LINK>); survival data in full publication unable to be analysed (<LINK REF="STD-Das-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Das 1999</LINK>); no control group without tamoxifen (<LINK REF="STD-French-study-1998" TYPE="STUDY">French study 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pelletier-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Pelletier 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schachschal-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Schachschal 2000</LINK>); confounded control with another drug added in place of tamoxifen (<LINK REF="STD-Manesis-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Manesis 1995</LINK>); not assessing the effect of tamoxifen (<LINK REF="STD-Raoul-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Raoul 1994</LINK>); or assessing the combination of tamoxifen and medroxyprogesterone acetate (<LINK REF="STD-Uchino-1993a" TYPE="STUDY">Uchino 1993a</LINK>). </P>
<P>Ten trials were identified, including a total of 1709 patients. A total of 9 trials examined the effect of tamoxifen versus placebo or no treatment on outcomes including overall survival. One trial examined the effect of adding tamoxifen to chemotherapy with doxorubicin. One trial is referenced twice to enable arms using two different doses of tamoxifen to be analysed separately (<LINK REF="STD-Chow-2002-60-mg" TYPE="STUDY">Chow 2002 60 mg</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chow-2002-120-mg" TYPE="STUDY">Chow 2002 120 mg</LINK>).</P>
<P>The daily dose of tamoxifen was 20 mg in five trials (<LINK REF="STD-Melia-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Melia 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Martinez-Cerezo-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Martinez Cerezo 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Castells-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Castells 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Coll-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Coll 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Barbare-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Barbare 2002</LINK>), 30 mg in one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Liu-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Liu 2000</LINK>), 40 mg in two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Riestra-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Riestra 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-CLIP-2002" TYPE="STUDY">CLIP 2002</LINK>), 60 mg in two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Elba-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Elba 1994</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Chow-2002-60-mg" TYPE="STUDY">Chow 2002 60 mg</LINK>), and 120 mg in one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Chow-2002-120-mg" TYPE="STUDY">Chow 2002 120 mg</LINK>).</P>
<P>The characteristics of patients in these 10 trials were similar. The mean age ranged from 60 to 67 years in the 11 trials testing tamoxifen on its own, but was lower (52 years) in the trial testing tamoxifen with doxorubicin (<LINK REF="STD-Melia-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Melia 1987</LINK>). The majority of patients were male in all studies (range: 71 to 89%). Underlying liver disease was reported in 98 to 100% of patients. All trials included fewer than 25% of patients with Childs-Pugh stage C liver disease and Okuda stage III disease. Only one study reported the inclusion of patients who had previously undergone either surgery (5% of patients) or chemotherapy (16% of patients) (<LINK REF="STD-CLIP-2002" TYPE="STUDY">CLIP 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>Histological or cytological diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma was required in only one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Coll-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Coll 1995</LINK>). In five trials, either histological diagnosis or an elevated alpha fetoprotein level together with imaging suggestive of hepatocellular carcinoma was accepted for diagnosis (<LINK REF="STD-Melia-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Melia 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Martinez-Cerezo-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Martinez Cerezo 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Riestra-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Riestra 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Liu-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Liu 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-CLIP-2002" TYPE="STUDY">CLIP 2002</LINK>). Diagnosis was made without histology or cytology in 17, 14, 17, 25, and 24% of patients, respectively. A further two trials accepted similar criteria for diagnosis, but did not report the number of patients diagnosed without histology or cytology (<LINK REF="STD-Castells-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Castells 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chow-2002-120-mg" TYPE="STUDY">Chow 2002 120 mg</LINK>,<LINK REF="STD-Chow-2002-60-mg" TYPE="STUDY">Chow 2002 60 mg</LINK>). Criteria for the diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma were not reported in two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Elba-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Elba 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Barbare-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Barbare 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>Median survival for both experimental and control arms was available for all studies reviewed, but was very variable, suggesting that the patient groups were more heterogeneous than the patient characteristics implied. Median survival in the control arms ranged from just over one month (<LINK REF="STD-Liu-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Liu 2000</LINK>) to 12 months (<LINK REF="STD-Elba-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Elba 1994</LINK>) in groups without any prior surgical treatment, and was 16 months in the study allowing prior surgery (<LINK REF="STD-CLIP-2002" TYPE="STUDY">CLIP 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>One study examined oestrogen and progesterone receptor expression in tumours where possible, correlating this with outcome (<LINK REF="STD-Liu-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Liu 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>One trial including 420 patients could not provide data for the meta-analyses because it did not report the number of deaths (<LINK REF="STD-Barbare-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Barbare 2002</LINK>). </P>
<P>Quality of life was examined in only one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Chow-2002-120-mg" TYPE="STUDY">Chow 2002 120 mg</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chow-2002-60-mg" TYPE="STUDY">Chow 2002 60 mg</LINK>) using a validated tool (EOTRC QLQ-C30 questionnaire), but the data were not reported in detail.</P>
<P>Only three trials reported radiological response as an outcome (<LINK REF="STD-Melia-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Melia 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Coll-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Coll 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Liu-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Liu 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>Gender difference in response or survival was not a pre-defined outcome in any study.</P>
<P>Treatment toxicity was not reported as a pre-defined outcome in any study.</P>

<P>The methodologic quality of the studies was variable. </P>

<P>Only three trials were assessed as adequately placebo controlled and blinded (<LINK REF="STD-Castells-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Castells 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Riestra-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Riestra 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chow-2002-120-mg" TYPE="STUDY">Chow 2002 120 mg</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chow-2002-60-mg" TYPE="STUDY">Chow 2002 60 mg</LINK>), two were placebo controlled but the adequacy of blinding was unclear (<LINK REF="STD-Elba-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Elba 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Coll-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Coll 1995</LINK>), one was single-blind (patients blinded) and used placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Liu-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Liu 2000</LINK>), and the remainder either had no placebo control (<LINK REF="STD-Melia-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Melia 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Martinez-Cerezo-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Martinez Cerezo 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-CLIP-2002" TYPE="STUDY">CLIP 2002</LINK>) or the report was unclear as to whether the control group had received placebo or no treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Barbare-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Barbare 2002</LINK>). </P>
<P>Follow-up and the number and reasons for withdrawals and dropouts were well reported in five trials (<LINK REF="STD-Melia-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Melia 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Martinez-Cerezo-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Martinez Cerezo 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Castells-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Castells 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chow-2002-120-mg" TYPE="STUDY">Chow 2002 120 mg</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chow-2002-60-mg" TYPE="STUDY">Chow 2002 60 mg</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-CLIP-2002" TYPE="STUDY">CLIP 2002</LINK>), but inadequately reported in four (<LINK REF="STD-Elba-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Elba 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Coll-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Coll 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Liu-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Liu 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Barbare-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Barbare 2002</LINK>) and unclear in one (<LINK REF="STD-Riestra-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Riestra 1998</LINK>). </P>

Sample size calculations were reported in five trials (<LINK REF="STD-Martinez-Cerezo-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Martinez Cerezo 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Castells-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Castells 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Riestra-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Riestra 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chow-2002-120-mg" TYPE="STUDY">Chow 2002 120 mg</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chow-2002-60-mg" TYPE="STUDY">Chow 2002 60 mg</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-CLIP-2002" TYPE="STUDY">CLIP 2002</LINK>) and were not mentioned in the remaining trial reports.</P>

<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
<P>
<B>Overall survival<BR/>
</B>NOTE: Ratios of treatment effects for survival outcomes are reported so that HRs less than 1.0 favour tamoxifen-containing arms and values greater than 1.0 favour the control group. The plots for survival are hazard ratio (HR) plots, although they are labelled as odds ratio (OR) plots in the default mode of RevMan Analyses. </P>
<P>Overall survival was not significantly affected by treatment with tamoxifen (hazard ratio 1.05; 95% CI 0.96 to 1.16; P = 0.36) (Comparison 01). This comparison showed no significant statistical heterogeneity (P = 0.2 and I<SUP>2</SUP> = 25.9%).</P>
<P>Exclusion of trials published in abstract form did not affect the results of the analysis (hazard ratio 1.05; 95% CI 0.94 to 1.17; P = 0.4 (Comparison 02). However, only two trials were published in abstract form only (<LINK REF="STD-Coll-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Coll 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Barbare-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Barbare 2002</LINK>) and insufficient results were available to include one of these studies in the analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Barbare-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Barbare 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>Funnel plots suggested publication bias/low methodological quality bias as there were several small trials with positive results, but no corresponding small trials with negative results (<LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>). While there was no overall effect of tamoxifen survival, subgroup analysis according to methodological quality suggested that tamoxifen might be harmful in the trials with the best methods (three of three quality components, hazard ratio 1.15; 95% CI 0.99 to 1.34; P = 0.06) but beneficial in the trials with the weakest methods (one or fewer quality criteria, hazard ratio 0.82; 95% CI 0.60 to 1.12; P = 0.2). However, this analysis is confounded by the dose of tamoxifen, which was higher in the trials with best methods.</P>
<P>In subgroup analysis, there was an overall survival trend favouring the control arm with increasing dose of tamoxifen (Comparison 04). The HR for overall survival was lowest for trials of tamoxifen 20 mg daily (hazard ratio 0.88; 95% CI 0.69 to 1.44; P = 0.71), higher in trials of tamoxifen 40 mg daily (hazard ratio 1.00; 95% CI 0.85 to 1.19; P = 1.0), higher still in trials of tamoxifen 60 mg daily (hazard ratio 1.03; 95% CI 0.81 to 1.31; P = 0.8), and highest in the single trial of tamoxifen 120 mg daily (hazard ratio 1.29; 95% CI 1.04 to 1.6; P = 0.02). </P>
<P>The influence of gender on treatment effects was not an a priori objective in any of the trials. One trial reported no difference in survival between men and women in post-hoc analyses (<LINK REF="STD-Castells-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Castells 1995</LINK>). One trial reported a significant benefit of tamoxifen for males without major hepatic insufficiency (P = 0.02) but no significant benefit for women (P = 0.59) (<LINK REF="STD-Barbare-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Barbare 2002</LINK>). There were insufficient data to perform a meta-analysis on these subgroups. There was no comment on gender differences in the only trial to report oestrogen receptor status in tumours (<LINK REF="STD-Liu-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Liu 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of life<BR/>
</B>Quality of life data were reported in only one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Chow-2002-120-mg" TYPE="STUDY">Chow 2002 120 mg</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chow-2002-60-mg" TYPE="STUDY">Chow 2002 60 mg</LINK>). The authors commented that there were no appreciable differences in global quality of life between the treatment groups and that scores seemed somewhat lower with the highest dose of tamoxifen (120 mg), but the data were not presented in any detail. </P>
<P>
<B>Tumour response</B>
<BR/>Tumour response rates were not significantly affected by tamoxifen. Radiological response was reported in four trials (<LINK REF="STD-Melia-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Melia 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Castells-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Castells 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Coll-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Coll 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Liu-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Liu 2000</LINK>). Whilst the response criteria were not defined, Coll et al reported no partial responses and similar rates of progressive disease amongst treated and untreated groups (78% versus 79%). Castells et al reported one partial response (World Health Organisation response criteria) in the placebo group, and the development of progressive disease was not different between the two groups. Melia et al reported partial response rates of 11% with doxorubicin alone and 16% with doxorubicin plus tamoxifen (not significant). Liu et al reported no partial responses and similar rates of progressive disease at three months (54% without tamoxifen versus 43% with tamoxifen). </P>
<P>No trials reported changes in alpha foetoprotein levels during treatment. <BR/> <BR/>
<B>Toxicity and adverse events </B>
<BR/>Toxicity and adverse events were reported inconsistently. Reports of two trials made no mention of toxicity (<LINK REF="STD-Melia-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Melia 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Coll-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Coll 1995</LINK>). Reports of three trials included comments that treatment was '"well-tolerated" or had "negligible" or "minimal" toxicity (<LINK REF="STD-Castells-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Castells 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Riestra-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Riestra 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Liu-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Liu 2000</LINK>). Reports of two trials described minor side effects such as diarrhoea, thrombophlebitis, vertigo, and hot flushes in small numbers of patients (<LINK REF="STD-Elba-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Elba 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Barbare-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Barbare 2002</LINK>). The two largest trials reported toxicity in more detail (<LINK REF="STD-Chow-2002-120-mg" TYPE="STUDY">Chow 2002 120 mg</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chow-2002-60-mg" TYPE="STUDY">Chow 2002 60 mg</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-CLIP-2002" TYPE="STUDY">CLIP 2002</LINK>). Chow et al graded adverse events as mild, moderate or severe, with only 3% of patients developing moderate or severe toxicity, with equal numbers on tamoxifen and placebo. A total of 1.5% of patients on tamoxifen withdrew from treatment due to toxicity. The CLIP-1 investigators reported that 10% of patients on tamoxifen developed toxicity, and 4% stopped tamoxifen because of toxicity. None of the trial reports described thromboembolic events.</P>
<P>Although analysis using only trials with histological or cytological confirmation of diagnosis was initially planned, only one small study fulfilled these criteria (<LINK REF="STD-Coll-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Coll 1995</LINK>). Hence this analysis was not performed.</P>
</INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>We identified 10 randomised trials testing tamoxifen versus placebo or no intervention in 1709 people with hepatocellular carcinoma. We found no evidence of benefit. There were no apparent effects on survival, tumour response rate, or quality of life. Furthermore, the trials with the least risk of bias tended to show that tamoxifen was associated with increased mortality, whereas the trials with the largest risk of bias showed the opposite effect.</P>
<P>Funnel plots suggested publication bias and low methodological quality bias, with several small positive trials and no corresponding small negative trials. It is possible that there are additional, small, unpublished negative trials. Their inclusion would improve the rigour of this review, but would not affect its conclusion, namely that the available evidence argues against use of tamoxifen in hepatocellular carcinoma.</P>
<P>There were insufficient data available from one of the larger trials (<LINK REF="STD-Barbare-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Barbare 2002</LINK>) for inclusion in the meta-analysis. However, the trial showed no significant difference in median survival between the tamoxifen and control arms, and it is unlikely that inclusion of results from this trial would change the review conclusions. Efforts to obtain these data as well as the data from <LINK REF="STD-Das-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Das 1999</LINK> will continue and they will be included in an updated version of this review when available.</P>
<P>Many trials identified were of low methodological quality. Only two trials were assessed as showing a low potential for bias (<LINK REF="STD-Castells-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Castells 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chow-2002-120-mg" TYPE="STUDY">Chow 2002 120 mg</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chow-2002-60-mg" TYPE="STUDY">Chow 2002 60 mg</LINK>). Our findings that tamoxifen seemed to increase mortality in high quality trials but have the opposite effect in low quality trials supports the contention that low quality trials are susceptible to bias (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moher-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kjaergard-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kjaergard 2001</LINK>). However, we were not able to determine whether the difference in treatment response was due to the methodological quality of the trials or the dose of tamoxifen, as this finding is confounded by the use of higher doses of tamoxifen in the better quality trials (<LINK REF="STD-Chow-2002-120-mg" TYPE="STUDY">Chow 2002 120 mg</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chow-2002-60-mg" TYPE="STUDY">Chow 2002 60 mg</LINK>).</P>
<P>Toxicity was reported inconsistently, but few adverse events or withdrawals were noted. The absence of any thromboembolic events was surprising and may reflect either coagulopathy from underlying liver disease or the absence of rigorous reporting adverse events.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>These data do not support the use of tamoxifen for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Further research on the effects of tamoxifen in hepatocellular carcinoma appears not to be warranted. The data do not support further trials of dose escalation in this disease. Tamoxifen should not be used as a control arm for future trials in hepatocellular carcinoma. Future promising interventions should be tested in large, well-designed, randomised clinical trials that should be reported according to the CONSORT guidelines.</P>

<REFERENCE NOTES="&lt;p&gt;We tested the hypothesis that a combination of sex hormone suppression and inhibition of their target receptors might improve survival for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Eighty-five consequent, previously untreated HCC patients with inoperable disease, were randomized to receive the luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LR-RH)-analogue triptorelin and the antiestrogen tamoxifen (33 patients) or triptorelin plus the antiandrogen flutamide (23 patients), or only placebo (29 patients) in a double blind fashion. All groups were comparable as to age, sex, tumor extension, underlying cirrhosis and biochemical parameters. The tamoxifen (TMX) group had a significantly longer survival (282 days) compared with flutamide (112 days) and with placebo (127 days) groups (P = .0238, log rank test). The upper quartile of patients in the TMX group lived 384 days or longer, and most of them (57.1%) were women (P &amp;lt; .0005), in contrast to the upper quartile of the placebo (170 days, 16.7% women) and the flutamide group (134 days, 33.3% women). The calculated tumor volume doubling time (TVDT) was significantly higher in the TMX group (296 days) than in the other two groups (99 and 101 days for placebo and flutamide groups, respectively, P = .023). In a Cox proportional hazards model, the TMX treatment, along with the baseline Okuda's HCC stage, the hepatitis B surface antigen, the portal vein diameter, the carcino embryonic antigen (CEA) and a self-assessment score of quality of life, were covariates predicting survival.

<REFERENCE NOTES="&lt;p&gt;This article reports a prospective randomized controlled study to investigate the effect of sex hormone therapy combined with intra- arterial chemotherapy for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Thirty patients with unresectable HCC were randomly divided into two groups. A catheter was inserted into the hepatic artery of all patients. The first group (group A) was administered 60 mg/m2 of cisplatin (CDDP) on day 15 and 13 mg/m2 of Adriamycin (ADM) on day 1 and 8 postoperatively via the hepatic artery cannula; in addition, a daily dose of 150 mg 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) was administered orally. Tamoxifen (TAM) 25 mg/m2 daily and medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) 400 mg/m2 daily were also administered orally. TAM and MPA administration were alternated every 4 weeks. For the second group (group B) the same protocol of anticancer drugs administration, without the hormonal agents, was given. At least three courses of the treatments were carried out. Twelve patients in group A and 14 in group B were evaluated. Partial response of the hepatic tumor to the treatments was observed in 33.3% of group A patients and 21.4% of group B patients, a difference that was not statistically significant. The 1-year survival rate was 44.5% in group A and 33.0% in group B. The performance status of 25% of the patients in group A was significantly improved compared with 14.3% in group B (p &amp;lt; 0.05). TAM- and MPA-combined chemotherapy may not prolong the survival of patients with HCC, although it improves their quality of life.&lt;br&gt;Administration,-Oral/Adult-/Aged-/Antineoplastic-Agents,-Combined-Administration-And-Dosage/Antineoplastic-Agents,- Combined-Adverse-Effects/Carcinoma,-Hepatocellular-Classification/Carcinoma,-Hepatocellular-Diagnosis/Carcinoma,-Hepatocellular- Etiology/Carcinoma,-Hepatocellular-Mortality/Carcinoma,-Hepatocellular-Pathology/Cisplatin-Administration-And-Dosage/Doxorubicin- Administration-And-Dosage/Drug-Therapy,-Combination/Fluorouracil-Administration-And-Dosage/Infusions,-Intra-Arterial/Kidney- Diseases-Chemically-Induced/Kidney-Diseases-Epidemiology/Leukopenia-Chemically-Induced/Leukopenia-Epidemiology/Liver- Diseases-Chemically-Induced/Liver-Diseases-Epidemiology/Liver-Neoplasms-Classification/Liver-Neoplasms-Diagnosis/Liver- Neoplasms-Etiology/Liver-Neoplasms-Mortality/Liver-Neoplasms-Pathology/Medroxyprogesterone-17-Acetate-Administration-And- Dosage/Medroxyprogesterone-17-Acetate-Adverse-Effects/Middle-Age/Neoplasm-Staging/Prospective-Studies/Remission-Induction/Survival-Rate/Tamoxifen-Administration-And-Dosage/*Antineoplastic-Agents,-Combined-Therapeutic-Use/*Carcinoma,-Hepatocellular-Drug-Therapy/*Liver-Neoplasms-Drug-Therapy/*Medroxyprogesterone-17-Acetate-Therapeutic-Use&lt;/p&gt;" PRIMARY="YES" TYPE="JOURNAL_ARTICLE">
