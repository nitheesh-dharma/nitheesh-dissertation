<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>Epilepsy is one of the most common long-term disorders of the nervous system, and despite several antiepileptic drugs being available, 30% of people continue having seizures (fits). Reports have suggested that melatonin can work in epilepsy with a good safety profile. Melatonin is produced by the body and is prescribed by doctors to treat sleep disorders and problems such as jet lag.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>We searched medical databases for clinical trials of melatonin added to another antiepileptic drug (add-on treatment) compared with antiepileptic drug plus add-on pretend treatment (placebo) or add-on no treatment in people with epilepsy. The participants were of any age or sex and included children and adults with disabilities. The studies measured reduction of seizure frequency by half, proportion of people with no seizures (seizure freedom), side effects, and improvement in quality of life.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>We found six trials representing 125 participants for the present review. They reported two different comparisons: melatonin versus placebo and melatonin 5 mg versus melatonin 10 mg.</P>
<P>Included trials did not evaluate seizure frequency, seizure freedom, and adverse events in a methodical way. Only one study reported seizure frequency and none of the participants had a change in frequency occurring during the trial compared to before the trial. Only one trial evaluated the effect of melatonin on quality of life and found no improvement with add-on melatonin compared with add-on placebo. </P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
</P>
<P>The included trials were of poor methodological quality and it was not possible to draw any definitive conclusions about the role of melatonin in reducing seizure frequency or improving the quality of life in people with epilepsy.</P>
<P>The evidence was current to January 2016.</P>

<P>This is an updated version of the original Cochrane review published in Issue 6, 2012.</P>
<P>Epilepsy is one of the most common chronic neurological disorders. Despite the plethora of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) currently available, 30% of people continue having seizures. This group of people requires a more aggressive treatment, since monotherapy, the first choice scheme, fails to control seizures. Nevertheless, polytherapy often results in a number of unwanted effects, including neurological disturbances (somnolence, ataxia, dizziness), psychiatric and behavioural symptoms, and metabolic alteration (osteoporosis, inducement or inhibition of hepatic enzymes, etc.). The need for better tolerated AEDs is even more urgent in this group of people. Reports have suggested an antiepileptic role of melatonin with a good safety profile.</P>

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2016-03-01 10:40:58 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>For the latest update, we searched the Cochrane Epilepsy Group's Specialized Register (12 January 2016), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) via the Cochrane Register of Studies Online (CRSO, 12 January 2016), and MEDLINE (Ovid, 11 January 2016). We searched the bibliographies of any identified study for further references. We handsearched selected journals and conference proceedings. We applied no language restrictions. In addition, we contacted melatonin manufacturers (i.e. Nathura) and original investigators to identify any unpublished studies.</P>

<P>Review authors independently selected trials for inclusion according to pre-defined criteria, extracted relevant data, and evaluated the methodological quality of trials.

</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-03-01 10:41:02 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included six publications, with 125 participants (106 aged under 18 years). Two different comparisons were available: melatonin versus placebo and melatonin 5 mg versus melatonin 10 mg. Despite our primary intention, due to insufficient information on outcomes, we were unable to perform any meta-analyses, but summarized data narratively. Four studies were randomized, double-blind, cross-over, placebo-controlled trials and two were randomized, double-blind, parallel, placebo-controlled trials. Only two studies provided the exact number of seizures during the trial compared to the baseline: none of the participants with seizures during the trial had a change in seizure frequency compared with the baseline. Two studies systematically evaluated adverse effects (worsening of headache was reported in a child with migraine under melatonin treatment). Only one study systematically evaluated quality of life, showing no statistically significant improvement in quality of life in the add-on melatonin group.</P>

<P>Included studies were of poor methodological quality, and did not systematically evaluate seizure frequency and adverse events, so that it was impossible to summarize data in a meta-analysis.

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2016-03-01 19:57:04 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review is an update of a previously published review in The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (Issue 6, 2012) on 'Melatonin as add-on treatment for epilepsy' (<LINK REF="REF-Brigo-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brigo 2012</LINK>).</P>
<P>Epilepsy is defined as the occurrence of at least two unprovoked epileptic seizures (<LINK REF="REF-Commission-ILAE-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Commission ILAE 1989</LINK>). It is one of the most common neurological disorders: in Western countries the incidence in adults is 50/100,000 population per year (<LINK REF="REF-Hauser-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hauser 1998</LINK>) with a prevalence of 5/1000 to 10/1000 people (<LINK REF="REF-Goodridge-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goodridge 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McDonald-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">McDonald 2000</LINK>). In children from birth to 15 years of age, the incidence is 5/10,000 to 7/10,000 children per year and prevalence 5/1000 children, the differences being mainly due either to benign epilepsy syndromes that remit spontaneously or to severe pathologies with neurological involvement causing death.</P>
<P>Despite the plethora of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) developed since the introduction of phenobarbital in 1912, 30% of people continue having seizures (<LINK REF="REF-Annegers-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Annegers 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Camfield-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Camfield 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cockerell-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cockerell 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Elwes-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elwes 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Goodridge-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goodridge 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McDonald-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">McDonald 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shorvon-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shorvon 1982</LINK>). This group of people requires a more aggressive treatment, since monotherapy, the first choice scheme, fails to control seizures. Nevertheless, polytherapy often results in a number of unwanted effects, including neurological disturbances (somnolence, ataxia, dizziness), psychiatric and behavioural symptoms, and metabolic alteration (osteoporosis, inducement or inhibition of hepatic enzymes, etc.). The need for better tolerated AEDs is even more urgent in this group of people.</P>
<P>Research has suggested an antiepileptic role of melatonin, an indolamine synthesized from tryptophan in the pineal gland and released in a circadian pattern (<LINK REF="REF-Brzezinski-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brzezinski 1997</LINK>). In clinical practice, melatonin is used to treat sleep-wake cycle disorders, mainly jet lag syndrome and shift worker disturbances (<LINK REF="REF-Herxheimer-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Herxheimer 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Herxheimer-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Herxheimer 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Revell-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Revell 2006</LINK>), as well as for the treatment of sleep disorders in children with neurological and developmental problems (<LINK REF="REF-Cortesi-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cortesi 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Weiss-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weiss 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>Both in vitro and in vivo studies have suggested an antiepileptic activity of melatonin (<LINK REF="REF-Anton_x002d_Tay-1974" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anton-Tay 1974</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Je-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Je 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Molina_x002d_Carballo-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Molina-Carballo 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mevissen-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mevissen 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fauteck-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fauteck 1999</LINK>), mediated by an antioxidant effect (<LINK REF="REF-Kabuto-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kabuto 1998</LINK>), an increase in &#947;-aminobutyric acid (GABA) concentration (<LINK REF="REF-Niles-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Niles 1987</LINK>) and GABA receptor affinity (<LINK REF="REF-Acuna_x002d_Castroviejo-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Acuna-Castroviejo 1986</LINK>), or a reduction of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) excitatory effect (<LINK REF="REF-Munoz_x002d_Hoyos-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Munoz-Hoyos 1998</LINK>). In contrast, one author has reported a proconvulsant effect of melatonin (<LINK REF="REF-Sheldon-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sheldon 1998</LINK>). Although studies investigating the long-term effects of melatonin are still lacking, high melatonin doses have so far proved safe (<LINK REF="REF-Seabra-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Seabra 2000</LINK>).</P>

<P>The update of searches for this review yielded 24 results (three from Cochrane Epilepsy Group Specialized Register, 11 from CENTRAL, and 10 from MEDLINE). After removing seven duplicates, we identified 17 articles for possible inclusion. After careful evaluation of titles and abstracts, we excluded 14 articles. We added two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Goldberg_x002d_Stern-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Goldberg-Stern 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jain-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Jain 2015</LINK>), to the four studies already included in the previous version of this review (<LINK REF="STD-Coppola-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Coppola 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gupta-2004a" TYPE="STUDY">Gupta 2004a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gupta-2004b" TYPE="STUDY">Gupta 2004b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hancock-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Hancock 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>Hence, six publications with 125 participants (mostly children) fulfilled the inclusion criteria of the present review.

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Coppola 2004</HEADING>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Coppola-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Coppola 2004</LINK> was a randomized, double-blind, cross-over, placebo-controlled trial conducted in people aged over 12 months, with mental retardation with/without seizures, and diagnosed with wake-sleep disorders. The study enrolled 32 participants, seven participants (28%) were lost to the study. Twenty-five participants (16 males, nine females), aged from 3.6 to 26 years (mean 10.5 years), mostly (18/25) with epileptic seizures, completed both melatonin and placebo phases. Participants were randomized to oral synthetic fast-release melatonin or placebo. Phase one (melatonin or placebo) lasted four weeks and, after a cross-over period of one week, each participant entered phase two (melatonin or placebo), which lasted four weeks. Melatonin was initiated at a daily dose of 3 mg, at nocturnal bedtime. In case of inefficacy, melatonin dose could be titrated up to 9 mg during the following two weeks in increments of 3 mg/week, unless the participant was unable to tolerate it. The dose of pre-existing medication was maintained throughout the trial. At the end of phase two, responders to melatonin entered an open-label phase of two months. The study reported seizure freedom and seizure frequency without clearly specifying the exact number of seizures; authors stated only that out of the 11 seizure-free participants before starting the study, nine remained unchanged on melatonin treatment. There was no overall significant change with regards to seizure control with melatonin. Melatonin was well tolerated in all participants and no adverse effects were reported.</P>

<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Gupta-2004a" TYPE="STUDY">Gupta 2004a</LINK> was a randomized, double-blind, parallel, placebo-controlled trial. It was conducted in children with epilepsy aged 3 to 12 years on carbamazepine monotherapy to evaluate the effects of add-on melatonin administration on quality of life using a parental questionnaire (Sleep Behavior Questionnaire). Children had to be seizure-free for at least the last six months before enrolment. Of the 31 children enrolled, 13 (mean age 8.3 years) randomly received add-on melatonin, and 15 (mean age 8.1 years) received add-on placebo. Two children in the placebo group and one child in the melatonin group were lost to follow-up. The questionnaire was administered before add-on melatonin/placebo and four weeks after (28 to 32 days). No data on seizure freedom or seizure frequency were reported. No adverse events warranting discontinuation of the therapy were reported.</P>

It was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. It was also conducted in children with an epilepsy, aged 3 to 12 years on valproate monotherapy to evaluate the effect of add-on melatonin on quality of life using a parental questionnaire (QOLCE). Children had to be seizure-free for six months before enrolment. Of the 31 children enrolled, 16 (mean age 7.4 years) randomly received add-on melatonin, and 14 (mean age 6.6 years) received add-on placebo. One child in the placebo group was lost to follow-up. The questionnaire was administered before add-on melatonin/placebo and four weeks after (28 to 32 days). No data on seizure freedom or seizure frequency were reported. No adverse events warranting discontinuation of therapy were reported.</P>

<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Hancock-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Hancock 2005</LINK> was a randomized, double-blind, controlled, cross-over trial investigating the response to oral melatonin using two dose regimens in people with sleep disorders associated with tuberous sclerosis complex (<LINK REF="STD-Hancock-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Hancock 2005</LINK>). Eight outpatients with tuberous sclerosis complex and sleep disorder (aged 18 months to 31 years) received either 5 or 10 mg of melatonin. All participants had epilepsy and received concurrent AEDs, and all had mental retardation and behavioural difficulties. The trial consisted of following phases: an initial two-week baseline period to confirm the sleep disorder and familiarize the participant or carer with the requirements of the trial with no treatment; a two-week period of treatment with either 5 or 10 mg of melatonin; a two-week washout period with no treatment; and a two-week period of treatment with the alternative dose of melatonin (i.e. 5 mg after 10 mg or 10 mg after 5 mg). Sleep latency, total sleep time, number of awakenings, and seizure frequency were recorded in sleep and seizure diaries. There was no evidence of a dose effect between 5 and 10 mg with respect to any outcome measure. The exact number of seizures occurring during the trial, compared to baseline, was given. None of the children who had seizures during the trial had a change in seizure frequency compared with the baseline period before melatonin treatment at either dose. Trial duration (including follow-up) was six weeks. During the study, three out of seven participants who completed the study remained seizure-free. There were no adverse effects reported or observed. Quality of life was not considered as an outcome.</P>

<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Goldberg_x002d_Stern-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Goldberg-Stern 2012</LINK> was a randomized, double-blind, cross-over, placebo-controlled trial conducted in people aged four years or over with drug-resistant epilepsy, defined as failure of three or more AEDs to control seizures. The inclusion criteria were no changes in AEDs dosage (therapeutic stability) for two months prior to the study and four or more seizures in the three weeks prior to the initiation of the study. Twelve participants (five male, seven female) aged between 9 and 32 years were included. The analysis excluded two participants because of lack of compliance in completing the diaries to assess seizure occurrence, and behaviour and sleep features. Five out of the 10 participants analyzed were younger than 18 years. All adults had childhood-onset epilepsy. Participants were randomly assigned to receive treatment with melatonin (10 mg daily at bedtime) or placebo for three weeks (stage one). After a one-week washout period, participants were switched to the other group (either placebo or melatonin) for three weeks (stage two). Trial duration (including follow-up) was seven weeks. The mean number of diurnal seizures was 7.75 during placebo treatment and 4.6 during melatonin treatment (P value = 0.034). Three participants showed a decrease of 50% or greater in diurnal seizures during melatonin treatment compared to placebo. There were no adverse effects reported or observed. Quality of life was not considered as an outcome.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Jain-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Jain 2015</LINK> was a randomized, double-blind, cross-over study conducted on 11 children aged 6 to 11 years with epilepsy and without developmental delay. Participants were randomized to receive placebo or a 9 mg sustained release melatonin formulation given about 30 minutes before bedtime for four weeks, followed by a one-week washout and a four-week cross-over condition. Seizure frequency was assessed by seizure diary reported by parents or carers. Thirteen participants were enrolled, 11 were randomized, and 10 (91%) completed the entire study and served the cohort for the analysis. Adherence was assessed at greater than 93% by counting tablets remaining at each treatment visit. Data were available for all 10 participants.</P>
<P>Four participants reported adverse events while taking melatonin (increased severity of headache in a child with history of migraine, bronchitis and ear infection, agitation, and increased urinary frequency) as compared to two participants taking placebo (agitation and increased urinary frequency).</P>
<P>Regarding antiepileptic efficacy, only two participants had ongoing epilepsy, although they had 50% reduction in seizure frequency with melatonin. Eight participants who were seizure-free remained seizure-free during the study. There was no increase in seizure frequency or difference in epilepsy frequency between melatonin and placebo.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2016-03-01 10:46:20 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This systematic review included six trials (two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Goldberg_x002d_Stern-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Goldberg-Stern 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jain-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Jain 2015</LINK>) were added to the four RCTs already included in the previous version of the review (<LINK REF="REF-Brigo-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brigo 2012</LINK>)). They did not systematically evaluate seizure frequency and adverse events, so it was impossible to summarize data in a meta-analysis. Only two studies systematically examined seizure frequency occurring during the trial, compared to baseline (<LINK REF="STD-Hancock-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Hancock 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jain-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Jain 2015</LINK>). With the exception of two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Hancock-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Hancock 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jain-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Jain 2015</LINK>), none of the included trials systematically evaluated seizure freedom and adverse events. Two trials selected only people who were seizure-free for at least six months before the beginning of the trial, so that 50% seizure reduction during the treatment period from baseline could not be calculated (<LINK REF="STD-Gupta-2004a" TYPE="STUDY">Gupta 2004a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gupta-2004b" TYPE="STUDY">Gupta 2004b</LINK>). From a clinical point of view, the reported follow-up duration of the included studies was not long enough to evaluate the antiepileptic efficacy of add-on melatonin, maybe because none of the trials was primarily designed to evaluate seizure freedom/reduction. Nevertheless, the relative high number of seizure-free participants reported in three included studies may be attributed to the fact that a large proportion of them was already recruited as seizure-free (three out of seven participants on either melatonin 5 mg or 10 mg in <LINK REF="STD-Hancock-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Hancock 2005</LINK>, and all participants in <LINK REF="STD-Gupta-2004a" TYPE="STUDY">Gupta 2004a</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Gupta-2004b" TYPE="STUDY">Gupta 2004b</LINK>). Conversely, in one study conducted in 12 people with drug-resistant epilepsy only three people experienced a decrease of at least 50% in diurnal seizures and no person was reported to be seizure free during melatonin treatment compared to placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Goldberg_x002d_Stern-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Goldberg-Stern 2012</LINK>). Only two studies explicitly reported the presence of adverse events (<LINK REF="STD-Hancock-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Hancock 2005</LINK>, none was reported; <LINK REF="STD-Jain-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Jain 2015</LINK>), and only one trial evaluated the direct influence of melatonin on quality of life showing to significant improvement (<LINK REF="STD-Gupta-2004b" TYPE="STUDY">Gupta 2004b</LINK>).</P>
<P>Five out of six studies included in the present review were primarily aimed to evaluate the effect of melatonin on wake-sleep disorders, thus not focusing on efficacy and tolerability of add-on melatonin as treatment for epilepsy. The fact that primary outcomes evaluated in most studies did not focus on seizure control is responsible for the lack of information regarding the efficacy of melatonin as add-on treatment for epilepsy. As a consequence of this lack of data, it was not possible to draw definite conclusions concerning efficacy and tolerability of melatonin as add-on treatment for epilepsy. Furthermore, it was impossible to establish whether a possible beneficial role of melatonin in epilepsy treatment was direct or indirect (i.e. seizure reduction as a consequence of an improvement in sleep quality).</P>

Among the 7 participants with uncontrolled seizures during the baseline phase, 1 became seizure-free (1 secondarily generalized partial seizure), 2 partially improved (1 partial seizure; 1 myoclonic seizure), and the other 2 were unchanged; the remaining 2 showed a seizure worsening 1 month after starting melatonin phase (1 cryptogenic generalized seizure; 1 secondary generalized partial seizure).
