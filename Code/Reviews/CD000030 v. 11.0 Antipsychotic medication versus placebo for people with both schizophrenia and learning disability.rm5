<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>People who are diagnosed with both learning disability and schizophrenia are generally treated with antipsychotic medication. This review highlights the limited evidence available for the use of this treatment in cases where people have received such a dual diagnosis.</P>
</SUMMARY_BODY>
</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Antipsychotic medication is the standard treatment for people with learning disability and schizophrenia.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To determine the effects of any antipsychotic medication compared with placebo for treating people with a dual diagnosis of learning disability and schizophrenia.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>For this update we searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Register of trials (July 2004), relevant reference lists and sought unpublished data from pharmaceutical companies.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>We included all randomised clinical trials of longer than one month's duration, involving people with both schizophrenia and learning disability (a measured IQ of 70 or less) that evaluated antipsychotic medication versus placebo.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>We reliably selected and assessed studies for methodological quality. Two reviewers, working independently, extracted data. We would have analysed dichotomous data on an intention-to-treat basis and presented continuous data with 65% completion rate. For dichotomous outcomes, our intention was to estimate a fixed effect relative risk (RR) with the 95% confidence interval (CI) together with the number needed to treat/harm (NNT/H).</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>We found only one relevant randomised trial using our search method and this had to be excluded. This study included four people with a dual diagnosis of schizophrenia and learning disability, but results were only available for two of the participants. It was unclear as to which groups the other two people were allocated. In order to display the data, we would have had to have made too many assumptions about these two people and any results would be uninformative and potentially misleading.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>Using the methods described we found no randomised controlled trial evidence to guide the use of antipsychotic medication for people with both learning disability and schizophrenia. Until the urgent need for randomised controlled trials is met, clinical practice will continue to be guided by extrapolation of evidence from randomised controlled trials involving people with schizophrenia, but without learning disability, and non-randomised trials of those with learning disability and schizophrenia.</P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
</ABSTRACT>
<BODY MODIFIED="2012-07-28 10:35:02 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND>
<P>For the purpose of this review we use the term 'learning disability/disabilities' to describe those people with a significant impairment of intelligence and social functioning with onset in the first eighteen years of life. This corresponds to 'mental retardation' as described in the major taxonomies DSM IV (<LINK REF="REF-APA-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">APA 1994</LINK>) and ICD 10 (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1992</LINK>).</P>
<P>Several investigators have shown high lifetime prevalence rates for general behavioural and psychiatric disorders in people with learning disabilities. These rates vary widely, from 20% - 64%, and are dependent upon the setting and diagnostic criteria used (<LINK REF="REF-Rutter-1970" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rutter 1970</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Corbett-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Corbett 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Eaton-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eaton 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lund-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lund 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gillberg-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gillberg 1986</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-Gillberg-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gillberg 1986</LINK> found that rates seem to increase with the severity of learning disability. This is complicated because the diagnosis of a specific psychiatric disorder becomes more difficult as the severity of learning disability increases. For these people, symptoms and signs of illness become ever more difficult to elucidate and interpret. For example, behavioural disturbances that might be symptomatic of mental illness in someone of normal intelligence could have other explanations in a person with learning disability. Despite these difficulties, the lifetime prevalence of the psychotic illnesses (disorders that feature loss of contact with reality) in those with learning disabilities has been estimated to range from 3.4% - 12.4% (<LINK REF="REF-Heaton_x002d_Ward-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heaton-Ward 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Parson-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parson 1984</LINK>). This compares with a lifetime prevalence of schizophrenia in the whole population of 0.25% - 0.53% (<LINK REF="REF-Jablensky-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jablensky 1986</LINK>). </P>
<P>Antipsychotic medication is very widely used for people with the dual diagnosis of mental illnesses and learning disability. There is conflicting opinion and research as to whether or not people with learning disability, when exposed to antipsychotic medication, may be at different (higher) risk of developing unpleasant, potentially disabling, short and long-term side effects, than those without a low IQ. It is feasible that, as a consequence of their underlying neurological damage, people with learning disability may be at greater risk of developing movement disorders (<LINK REF="REF-Youseff-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Youseff 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rogers-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rogers 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sachdev-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sachdev 1992</LINK> and <LINK REF="REF-Gingell-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gingell 1994</LINK>). (Movement disorders are; involuntary and abnormal movements of the face, mouth, shoulders, neck and trunk that may be difficult to reverse when medication is stopped, potentially distressing restlessness; tremor and disturbances of expression and gait.) <LINK REF="REF-Aman-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aman 1984</LINK> also raised concerns regarding the detrimental effect of antipsychotic medication on learning and cognitive abilities in those with learning disability.</P>
<P>In addition, many people with learning disability and behavioural disorders but no psychiatric diagnosis, are treated with antipsychotic medication (<LINK REF="REF-Clarke-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clarke 1990</LINK>). For these people, the antipsychotic medication is being used for its tranquillising, rather than its antipsychotic, properties (<LINK REF="REF-Wressell-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wressell 1990</LINK>).</P>

<OBJECTIVES>

<CRIT_STUDIES>
<P>We included all relevant randomised controlled trials (see below). We included trials that were described as double-blind, but that did not mention whether the study was randomised, in a sensitivity analysis. If there was no substantive difference within primary outcomes (see 'Types of outcome measures') when these studies were added, then we included them in the final analysis. If there was a substantive difference, we used only clearly randomised trials and described the results of the sensitivity analysis in the text. We excluded quasi-randomised studies, such as those allocating by using alternate days of the week.</P>
</CRIT_STUDIES>
<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>We included anyone over 18 years of age with both learning disability and schizophrenia. We defined learning disability as a measured IQ of 70 or less. Any diagnosis of schizophrenia was acceptable. </P>
<P>Before looking at the literature we decided not to use data from studies where those who simply had a diagnosis of 'psychosis' had been randomised. The reasoning behind this was that:<BR/>1. When used to describe people with a learning disability, the term 'psychosis' includes an even more varied collection of conditions than when it is used among the general, 'non-learning-disabled' population. We felt it reasonable to suggest that people with conditions such as autism (commonly subsumed under the umbrella term 'psychotic') would have a differential response to antipsychotic medication than those with schizophrenia; and<BR/>2. In clinical practice, large numbers of people with learning disability are given the specific diagnosis of schizophrenia and therefore a review focusing on this particular population was justified. </P>
<P>A review focusing on people with 'psychosis' and learning disability will be the focus of another review.</P>
</CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>1. Any antipsychotic medication, regardless of dosage, but of one month's duration. </P>
<P>We used the definition of antipsychotic medication given in the British National Formulary (<LINK REF="REF-BNF-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">BNF 2004</LINK>) section 4.2.1: <BR/>i Phenothiazine group - chlorpromazine, fluphenazine, methotrimeprazine, pericyazine, perphenazine, pipothiazine, prochlorperazine, promazine, thioridazine, trifluoperazine. <BR/>ii Butyrophenone group - benperidol, droperidol and haloperidol. <BR/>iii Diphenylbutylpiperidine group - pimozide. <BR/>iv Thioxanthene group - flupenthixol and zuclopenthixol.<BR/>v Substituted benzamide group - sulpiride. <BR/>vi Tricyclic dibenzoxazepine group - loxapine and oxypertine.<BR/>vii Newer antipsychotic drugs (atypical antipsychotics) - amisulpiride, aripirazole, clozapine, quetiapine, olanzapine, risperidone, sertindole and zotepine. </P>
<P>2. Placebo of longer than one month's duration. </P>
<P>Since the first version of this review, product licences have changed in the United Kingdom. Droperidol has been completely withdrawn; tablets and liquid (April 2001) and injection (June 2001). Sertindole was 'suspended' in December 1998 and is now available on a named patient basis and for patients taking part in a post marketing study. Thioridazine had a tightening of its licensed indications in December 2000, and is currently only licensed under specialist supervision as second line treatment of schizophrenia in adults.</P>

Where disagreement occurred regarding the possible relevance of the study this was resolved by discussion, or where there was still doubt, we acquired the full article for further inspection. Once the full articles were obtained we each, independently, decided whether they met the review criteria. Reviewers were not blinded to the names of the authors, institutions or journal of publication. Again, where disagreement occurred we resolved this by discussion and when this was not possible, we sought further information. We added these trials to the list of those awaiting assessment pending acquisition of further information.</P>
<P>2. Assessment of quality <BR/>We allocated trials to three quality categories, as described in the Cochrane Collaboration Handbook (<LINK REF="REF-Alderson-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alderson 2004</LINK>). Again, we each worked independently. Concealment of allocation remains the key aspect of methodology that predicts how susceptible results are to the inclusion of biases. Although adherence to blinding at outcome is also important, it is the ability of everyone involved to predict who will receive the next intervention that most substantially influences results. Category A studies in this review, where good concealment of allocation was made explicit, employed techniques that ensured that researchers and recipients could not have known the next intervention to be used. These studies would be considered low risk of bias. Any plausible biases were felt to be unlikely to seriously affect results. Category B studies assured the reader that studies were indeed randomised, but did not make concealment of allocation explicit. These studies were included but were at moderate risk of bias with some doubt raised about the results. Category C studies, where the process of allocation is neither described nor implied were not included. These studies are at high risk of bias and the plausible bias seriously weakens confidence in the results.</P>
<P>When disputes arose as to which category a trial was allocated, again, we attempted resolution by discussion. When this was not possible, and further information was necessary, we did not enter data into the analyses and allocated the study to the list of those awaiting assessment. We included only trials in Category A or B.</P>
<P>3. Data management <BR/>3.1 Data extraction<BR/>We independently extracted the data and where further clarification was needed we contacted the authors of trials for missing data.</P>
<P>3.2 Intention to treat analysis <BR/>We excluded data where more than 50% of participants in any group were lost to follow up. In studies with less than 50% dropout rate, we considered people leaving early to have had the negative outcome, except for the event of death. We analysed the impact of including studies with high attrition rates (25-50%) in a sensitivity analysis. If inclusion of data from this latter group did result in a substantive change in the estimate of effect we did not add their data to trials with less attrition, but presented these data separately.</P>
<P>4. Data analysis <BR/>4.1 Binary data <BR/>We calculated the fixed effects risk ratio (RR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI) for binary outcomes as well as the number needed to treat/harm statistic (NNT/H).</P>
<P>4.2 Continuous data <BR/>4.2.1 Normally distributed data<BR/>Continuous data on clinical and social outcomes are often not normally distributed. To avoid the pitfall of applying parametric tests to non-parametric data, we applied the following standards to all data before inclusion: (a) standard deviations and means were reported in the paper or were obtainable from the authors; (b) when a scale started from the finite number zero, the standard deviation, when multiplied by two, was less than the mean (as otherwise the mean is unlikely to be an appropriate measure of the centre of the distribution, (<LINK REF="REF-Altman-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Altman 1996</LINK>); (c) if a scale started from a positive value (such as PANSS which can have values from 30 to 210) the calculation described above was modified to take the scale starting point into account. In these cases skew is present if 2SD&gt;(S-Smin), where S is the mean score and Smin is the minimum score. Endpoint scores on scales often have a finite start and end point and these rules can be applied to them. When continuous data are presented on a scale which includes a possibility of negative values (such as change on a scale), it is difficult to tell whether data are non-normally distributed (skewed) or not. We would have entered skewed data from studies of less than 200 participants in additional tables rather than into an analysis. Skewed data poses less of a problem when looking at means if the sample size is large and would have been entered into a synthesis.</P>
<P>For change data (endpoint minus baseline), the situation is even more problematic. In the absence of individual patient data it is impossible to know if data are skewed, though this is likely. After consulting the ALLSTAT electronic statistics mailing list, the reviewers would have presented change data in MetaView in order to summarise available information. In doing this, it was assumed either that data were not skewed or that the analyses could cope with the unknown degree of skew. Without individual patient data it is impossible to test this assumption. Where both change and endpoint data were available for the same outcome category, only endpoint data were presented. We acknowledge that by doing this, much of the published change data could have been excluded, but argue that endpoint data is more clinically relevant and that if change data were to be presented along with endpoint data, it would be given undeserved equal prominence. We contacted authors of studies that only reported change for endpoint figures. We would have reported non-normally distributed data in the 'other data types' tables. </P>
<P>4.2.2 Summary statistic<BR/>For continuous outcomes we estimated a weighted mean difference (WMD) between groups. Again this was based on the random effects model, as this takes into account any differences between studies even if there is no statistically significant heterogeneity. We did not consider continuous data presented without use of summary statistics (i.e. mean, SD, SE, median, interquartile range), although we noted the existence of these data in the text.</P>
<P>4.2.3 Valid Scales<BR/>A wide range of instruments are available to measure mental health outcomes. These instruments vary in quality and it has been shown that the use of rating scales which have not been described in a peer-reviewed journal (<LINK REF="REF-Marshall-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marshall 2000</LINK>) are associated with bias, or may not be valid, or even ad hoc. Therefore we set some minimum standards: i. the psychometric properties of the instrument should have been described in a peer-reviewed journal; ii. the instrument should either be a self-report, or completed by an independent rater or relative (not the therapist); and iii. the instrument should be a global assessment of an area of functioning.</P>
<P>4.2.4 Conversion to a common metric<BR/>To facilitate comparison between trials, variables (such as days in hospital) that could be reported in different metrics (mean days per year, per week or per month) were converted to a common metric (e.g. mean days per month). </P>
<P>4.3 Cluster trials<BR/>Studies increasingly employ 'cluster randomisation' (such as randomisation by clinician or practice) but analysis and pooling of clustered data poses problems. Firstly, authors often fail to account for intra class correlation in clustered studies, leading to a 'unit of analysis' error (<LINK REF="REF-Divine-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Divine 1992</LINK>) whereby p values are spuriously low, confidence intervals unduly narrow and statistical significance overestimated. This causes type I errors (<LINK REF="REF-Bland-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bland 1997</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Gulliford-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gulliford 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P> Where clustering was not accounted for in primary studies, we presented the data in a table, with a (*) symbol to indicate the presence of a probable unit of analysis error. In subsequent versions of this review we will seek to contact first authors of studies to obtain intra-class correlation co-efficients of their clustered data and to adjust for this by using accepted methods (<LINK REF="REF-Gulliford-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gulliford 1999</LINK>). Where clustering has been incorporated into the analysis of primary studies, we will present these data as if from a non-cluster randomised study, but adjusted for the clustering effect. </P>
<P>We have sought statistical advice and have been advised that the binary data as presented in a report should be divided by a 'design effect'. This is calculated using the mean number of participants per cluster (m) and the intraclass correlation co-efficent (ICC) [Design effect = 1+(m-1)*ICC] (<LINK REF="REF-Donner-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Donner 2002</LINK>). If the ICC was not reported, it was assumed to be 0.1 (<LINK REF="REF-Ukoumunne-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ukoumunne 1999</LINK>). </P>
<P>Where cluster studies were appropriately analysed taking into account intra-class correlation coefficients and relevant data documented in the report, synthesis with other studies would have been possible using the generic inverse variance technique.</P>
<P>5. Investigation for heterogeneity<BR/>Firstly, we would have considered all the included studies within any comparison to judge clinical heterogeneity. We then would have visually inspected the graphs to investigate the possibility of statistical heterogeneity and supplemented this using, primarily, the I-squared statistic. This provides an estimate of the percentage of variability due to heterogeneity rather than chance alone. Where the I-squared estimate was greater than or equal to 75%, we would have interpreted this as indicating the presence of high levels of heterogeneity (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2003</LINK>). If inconsistency had been high, data would not have been summated, but we would have presented them separately and investigated reasons for heterogeneity.</P>
<P>6. Addressing publication bias <BR/>We would have entered data from all included studies into a funnel graph (trial effect against trial size) in an attempt to investigate the likelihood of overt publication bias.</P>
<P>7. Sensitivity analyses <BR/>We would have tested the sensitivity of the results from the main outcomes for change when adding the assumption that those who did not complete the study had a poor outcome.</P>
<P>8. General <BR/>In all cases we would have entered data into Review Manager (RevMan) in such a way that the area to the left of the 'line of no effect' indicated a 'favourable' outcome for the antipsychotic drug.</P>
</DATA_COLLECTION>
</METHODS>
<RESULTS>
<STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<P>We have reported salient features of studies in the tables.</P>
<P>1. Excluded studies<BR/>We excluded 28 studies for a variety of reasons. Eighteen were not randomised and four were not placebo controlled. In others, participants did not have schizophrenia, or did have schizophrenia but not combined with learning disabilities, or the interventions were not an antipsychotic drug. <LINK REF="STD-Foote-1958" TYPE="STUDY">Foote 1958</LINK>, however, fulfilled the inclusion criteria. It was randomised, double-blind and of five months duration. Participants were hospitalised women on the same ward who had a major mental illness. Most suffered from schizophrenia (53/70). The trialists, however, described four as being "mentally backward patients with schizophrenia". All had been hospitalised for long periods. Participants received an active drug (chlorpromazine 50 mg and reserpine 0.5 mg) or placebo. Outcomes were clinically relevant with reports of global improvement, leaving the study early and adverse effects. It was impossible to clarify to which group the four with dual diagnoses had been allocated. Data on two people with learning disability were available but impossible to use. One person, allocated to the control group, was classified as having had a good recovery and been discharged. The other person with learning disability and schizophrenia, allocated to the active drug group, was withdrawn due to status epilepticus (difficult-to-control seizures). The groups to which the other two people were allocated were unclear. In order to display these data, we would have had to have made too many assumptions about these other two people and any results would be uninformative.</P>
<P>2. Studies awaiting assessment<BR/>We are not aware of any studies awaiting assessment. </P>
<P>3. Ongoing studies<BR/>We know of no ongoing studies.</P>
<P>4. Included studies<BR/>We found no studies possible to include in this review.</P>
</STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<STUDY_QUALITY>
<P>We could not include any studies.</P>
</STUDY_QUALITY>
<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
<P>1. Search<BR/>Through our electronic search we identified only 28 citations that required further inspection, and only one study nearly fulfilled the inclusion criteria (<LINK REF="STD-Foote-1958" TYPE="STUDY">Foote 1958</LINK>). We reconsidered the search phrase prior to this 2004 update, but we did not find any more citations for inclusion.</P>
<P>2. COMPARISON: ANY ANTIPSYCHOTIC versus PLACEBO<BR/>Any study that did include people with dual diagnosis of schizophrenia and learning difficulties did not report data separately for the group of interest to this review. All relevant data were masked within the totals presented in the papers. We have not been able to get data from the original authors.</P>
</INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>1. Breadth of review<BR/>We chose to undertake a review on the absolute effects of antipsychotics for people with the dual diagnoses of schizophrenia and learning disabilities. Simply put, this means we sought studies comparing this broad class of drugs with placebo. Randomised studies are difficult in this group of people. It is not easy to feel that truly informed consent has been granted. This participant group suffers not only from an illness that puts them, to a greater or lesser extent, out of touch with reality, but also a learning disability that may make understanding the issues involved problematic. It is understandable that researchers reticent to work in this area. Comparison of two 'active' drugs may be less difficult to justify, although issues of understanding remain. We plan to broaden the scope of this review to involve comparisons of one active drug versus another, but are left with the concern that all treatment of this vulnerable group of people is based on extrapolation of the findings of studies on people without this dual diagnosis. </P>
<P>2. The search<BR/>It is possible that the search failed to find relevant work. The Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Register is very comprehensive, but it is likely it still does not contain all relevant studies. Such work may not be published in mainstream sources. Dissertations are not widely indexed in the databases used to compile the Register and only a few conference proceedings are manually searched for inclusion. No conferences focusing on people with learning disability are searched as a matter of routine, and we hope to address this shortfall soon. Perhaps with the ever increasing availability of new databases of medical literature, relevant trials will become known. </P>
<P>3. No data<BR/>Antipsychotic drugs help people with schizophrenia, although this group of drugs may compromise cognitive functioning in people without learning disabilities (<LINK REF="REF-Papageorgiou-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Papageorgiou 2003</LINK>). Currently clinicians treating people with the two problems are doing so because of results extrapolated from the general adult population. Recently the issue of treating children with antidepressants has also been noted to be under-researched (<LINK REF="REF-Hazell-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hazell 2004</LINK>). Here, the very same issue of complacent extrapolation from one set of trials into an under-researched area has drawn considerable criticism, especially now that unpublished (<LINK REF="REF-Marshall-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marshall 2004</LINK>) and even suppressed (<LINK REF="REF-Lenzer-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lenzer 2004</LINK>) data are coming to light. </P>
<P>Although research in the area of dual diagnosis is problematic and fraught with ethical issues, current practice in treating this group by trusting that results from a less disabled group will be applicable, may be considered unethical.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>1. For people with learning disability and schizophrenia and their families<BR/>Data are available for the use of antipsychotics in non-learning disabled population with schizophrenia from which extrapolation may be made. There are no good quality, well-designed, conducted and reported studies. We feel that those with learning disability and schizophrenia together with their families should help address this shortfall. </P>
<P>2. For clinicians<BR/>There are debates about the processes that cause a person to have both learning disability and schizophrenia, and how the two processes may be similar or dissimilar (<LINK REF="REF-Matson-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Matson 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Weinberger-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weinberger 1995</LINK>). These debates have raised questions about the practice of extrapolating information gained from people with schizophrenia of 'normal' intelligence, to populations with the dual diagnosis of learning disability and schizophrenia.</P>
<P>Clinicians should continue to prescribe antipsychotic medication to those with learning disability and schizophrenia following national guidance (e.g. <LINK REF="REF-NICE-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2002</LINK>). This guidance highlights the exclusion of specific populations in the research such as those with learning disability. Evaluation of interventions is essential. Clinicians should share their uncertainty with service users and their carers.</P>
<P>3. For managers<BR/>Given that there is no specific randomised controlled evidence to inform the use of antipsychotics in people with learning disability and schizophrenia and clinicians are extrapolating from the non-learning disabled population, guidance such as that published by <LINK REF="REF-NICE-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2002</LINK> should be helpful. </P>
<P>4. For funders of research<BR/>This review highlights an enormous and important gap in research. Funders should target calls to address this omission.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>1. General<BR/>We felt that the lack of included trials was not a result of over-strict inclusion criteria but reflected a genuine dearth of useable material. This review has highlighted the complete absence of randomised controlled trials of antipsychotic medication focusing on the large group of people with both learning disability and schizophrenia. </P>
<P>Trials often exclude the learning disabled population. Where people with learning disability were included it was difficult or impossible to tell to which treatment groups they had been allocated and their results were not analysed with reference to their learning disability. Clearer presentation of results and making datasets available may help address this problem in the future (<LINK REF="REF-Moher-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 2001</LINK>). </P>
<P>2. Specific<BR/>There is an urgent need for well designed, funded, conducted and reported randomised controlled trials of effects of antipsychotics in people with learning disability and schizophrenia.</P>
