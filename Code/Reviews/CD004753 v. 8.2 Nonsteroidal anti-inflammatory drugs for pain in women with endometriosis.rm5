<P>
<B>What is the issue?</B>
</P>
<P>Endometriosis is a gynaecological condition that commonly affects women of childbearing age. It can lead to painful symptoms, including painful periods, pain during or after sexual intercourse, pelvic and lower abdominal pain and infertility. It can greatly affect women's quality of life by impacting their careers, everyday activities, sexual and nonsexual relationships and fertility. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are most commonly used as first-line treatment for women with endometriosis because they have few side effects, and many are available over the counter.</P>
<P>
<B>Why is this important?</B>
</P>
<P>Endometriosis is very common, but the condition can be difficult to diagnose. In 2015, 1.8 billion women (aged 15 to 49 years) in the world had received a diagnosis of endometriosis. It is estimated that up to 60% of women with painful periods have endometriosis. Endometriosis greatly affects women's quality of life, impacting their careers, everyday activities, sexual and nonsexual relationships and fertility. An unpublished survey conducted by a patient support organisation in the United Kingdom - Endometriosis UK (<A HREF="http://www.endometriosis-uk.org/">www.endometriosis-uk.org/</A>) - found that 65% of women with endometriosis reported that their condition had negatively affected their employment. Ten per cent of women had to reduce their hours of work, and 30% had not been able to continue in the same employment. As many as 16% of women were unable to continue in any employment, and 6% needed to claim state benefits; thus, in addition to their feelings of loss as contributors to society, they became dependent upon others. This increased their feelings of low self-esteem. Endometriosis is seen as a significant public health issue because a large number of women are affected and illnesses associated with this disease are significant.</P>
<P>Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are readily available without prescription for pain relief. They work by preventing or slowing down the production of prostaglandins, which helps to relieve the painful cramps associated with endometriosis. However, a Cochrane review on the use of NSAIDs for painful periods found greater risk of stomach upset (e.g. nausea, diarrhoea) or other side effects (e.g. headache, drowsiness, dizziness, dryness of the mouth). We conducted the present review to compare all NSAIDs used to treat women with painful symptoms caused by endometriosis versus placebo, other pain management drugs or no treatment, to evaluate their effectiveness and safety.</P>
<P>
<B>What evidence did we find?</B>
</P>
<P>We searched for new evidence in October 2016 and identified no new randomised controlled trials.</P>
<P>From previous updates, this review found limited evidence on the effectiveness of NSAIDs (specifically naproxen) for management of pain caused by endometriosis. This review is also limited in that it includes only one study with data suitable for analysis, and this study involved only 20 women. Available evidence is of very low quality, mainly owing to poor reporting of methods, lack of precision in findings for overall pain relief, unintended side effects of treatment and the need for extra pain relief. The included trial did not report on quality of life, effects on daily activities, absence from work or school or participant satisfaction with treatment.</P>
<P>
<B>What does this mean?</B>
</P>
<P>Available evidence does not allow us to conclude whether NSAIDs are effective for managing pain caused by endometriosis, or whether any individual NSAID is more effective than another. As has been shown in other Cochrane reviews, women who use NSAIDs must be aware that NSAIDs may cause adverse effects such as nausea, vomiting, headache and drowsiness. Unless we identify new evidence in the future, we will not update this review again.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of evidence</B>
</P>
<P>Evidence was of very low quality owing to risk of bias and imprecision (findings were based on a single small trial).</P>

<P>We searched the Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility Group Specialised Register of Controlled Trials (October 2016), published in the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in the Cochrane Library, as well as MEDLINE (January 2008 to October 2016), Embase (date limited from 1 January 2016 to 19 October 2016, as all earlier references are included in CENTRAL output as a result of the Embase project), registers of ongoing trials and the reference lists of relevant publications. We identified no new randomised controlled trials. Unless we identify new evidence in the future, we will not update this review.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-05-04 17:29:49 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="Helen E Nagels">
<P>We identified no new trials for the 2016 update. This review includes two trials, but we included only one trial, with 24 women, in the analyses.</P>
<P>The overall risk of bias was unclear owing to lack of methodological detail. Using the GRADE method, we judged the quality of the evidence to be very low. We downgraded evidence for risk of bias and for imprecision (wide confidence intervals and evidence based on a single small trial).</P>
<P>Comparison of NSAIDs (naproxen) versus placebo revealed no evidence of a positive effect on pain relief (odds ratio (OR) 3.27, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.61 to 17.69; one trial, 24 women; <I>very low-quality evidence</I>) in women with endometriosis. Evidence indicating whether women taking NSAIDs (naproxen) were less likely to require additional analgesia (OR 0.12, 95% CI 0.01 to 1.29; one trial, 24 women; <I>very low-quality evidence</I>) or to experience side effects (OR 0.46, 95% CI 0.09 to 2.47; one trial, 24 women; <I>very low-quality evidence</I>) when compared with placebo was inconclusive.</P>

<P>Owing to lack of high-quality evidence and lack of reporting of outcomes of interest for this review, we can make no judgement as to whether NSAIDs (naproxen) are effective in managing pain caused by endometriosis. There is no evidence that one NSAID is more effective than another. As shown in other Cochrane reviews, women taking NSAIDs must be aware that these drugs may cause unintended effects.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2016-12-21 13:17:00 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Endometriosis is defined as the presence of endometrial tissue (stromal and glandular) outside the normal uterine cavity (<LINK REF="REF-Barbieri-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barbieri 1990</LINK>). Endometriosis is a common gynaecological condition that can lead to painful symptoms and infertility. Symptoms may include dysmenorrhoea (painful periods), dyspareunia (pain during or after sexual intercourse) and pelvic or lower abdominal pain. A less common symptom is cyclical pain at other sites related to endometriosis (<LINK REF="REF-Prentice-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Prentice 2003</LINK>). Endometriosis can be divided into four stages of severity (stage I: minimal disease; stage IV: severe disease), as defined by the classification system of the American Fertility Society (<LINK REF="REF-Canavan-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Canavan 2000</LINK>). Staging does not correlate with degree or severity of symptoms but quantifies the extent of disease visible at laparoscopy. The link between the pain experienced by women and the extent of endometriosis observed is not well understood, and the severity of the pain experienced does not always directly correlate with the severity of endometriosis (<LINK REF="STD-Kauppila-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Kauppila 1985</LINK>). Even when endometriosis is diagnosed, it may not be the cause of a woman's symptoms, as the mechanism by which pain is caused is not fully understood.</P>
<P>Endometriosis greatly affects women's quality of life, impacting their careers, everyday activities, sexual and nonsexual relationships and fertility (<LINK REF="REF-Davies-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davies 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jones-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jones 2002</LINK>). In an unpublished survey conducted by a patient support organisation in the United Kingdom - Endometriosis UK (www.endometriosis-uk.org/) - 65% of women with endometriosis reported that their condition had adversely affected their employment. Ten per cent of women had to reduce their hours of work, and 30% had not been able to continue in the same employment. As many as 16% of women were unable to continue in any employment, and 6% needed to claim state benefits; thus, in addition to their feelings of loss as contributors to society, they became dependent upon others, which increased their feelings of low self-esteem.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Prevalence </HEADING>
<P>The exact prevalence of endometriosis is unknown. However, endometriosis is a significant problem for a great number of women and incurs high socioeconomic costs (<LINK REF="REF-Prentice-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Prentice 2003</LINK>). Endometriosis primarily affects women of reproductive age (i.e. women who are menstruating). In women who experience no symptoms, the prevalence of endometriosis has been estimated to range from 2% to 22%, depending on the diagnostic criteria used and the populations studied. In women with painful periods, the prevalence of endometriosis ranges from 40% to 60%, and in women with subfertility, from 20% to 30%. The severity of symptoms and the probability of diagnosis increase with age, peaking at about 40 years of age (<LINK REF="REF-Berube-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Berube 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vessy-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vessy 1992</LINK>). In the year 2000, 1.5 billion women aged 15 to 49 years were living in the world. Prevalence of 1% means, therefore, that 15 million women worldwide could have endometriosis, assuming that 20% prevalence would indicate that 300 million women would have endometriosis. The actual figure must lie somewhere between these but is unknown, as the epidemiology of endometriosis is difficult to understand (<LINK REF="REF-Kennedy-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kennedy 2003</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Diagnosis </HEADING>
<P>Laparoscopy is considered the 'gold standard' for diagnosis of endometriosis (<LINK REF="REF-Canavan-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Canavan 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-rAFS-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">rAFS 1985</LINK>). However, endometriosis may also be diagnosed (or presumed) on the basis of a description of symptoms provided by a woman (and that may be suspected by the practitioner on the basis of history, pelvic examination and other tests such as ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and the CA-125 blood test). However, examination results, test findings and the presence or absence of a classic history and symptoms cannot confirm or rule out endometriosis.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2016-12-21 13:39:41 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The practitioner can treat symptoms of endometriosis in many ways, but treating the underlying disease often requires repeated medical or surgical interventions. Management of endometriosis is varied. Medical treatments for endometriosis include oral contraceptives, progestogens, testosterone derivatives and gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists (<LINK REF="REF-Rice-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rice 2002</LINK>). Surgical treatments include ablative techniques (destroying the endometriosis with energy such as laser or electricity) and excision (using scissors, electricity or laser). The latter surgical approach aims to relieve symptoms whilst conserving reproductive function. Practitioners may also perform more radical surgery in the form of hysterectomy, removal of the ovaries (oophorectomy) or both. Conventional medical and surgical treatments for endometriosis aim to remove or decrease deposits of ectopic endometrium (tissue like that lining the uterus but found outside the uterus) (<LINK REF="REF-Barbieri-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barbieri 1990</LINK>). Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are used most commonly as simple first-line treatment for women with endometriosis because they have few side effects, and many are available over the counter. They do not remove or decrease deposits of ectopic endometrium. NSAIDs may act on local cytokines within actual endometriotic deposits and may act as analgesics.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2016-12-21 08:55:39 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) work by decreasing pain severity. NSAIDs (including cyclo-oxygenase (COX)-2 inhibitors) inhibit prostaglandin production. Prostaglandins are locally produced chemicals that are believed to be responsible for causing the pain of endometriosis. NSAIDs purchased over the counter may be taken in doses that are insufficient to relieve pain. However, NSAIDs taken in high doses have the potential to cause side effects. A Cochrane review of 31 studies that compared NSAIDs versus placebo for primary dysmenorrhoea found a statistically significantly increased risk of adverse effects in the gastrointestinal (e.g. nausea, diarrhoea) and nervous (e.g. headache, drowsiness, dizziness, dryness of the mouth) systems (<LINK REF="REF-Marjoribanks-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marjoribanks 2015</LINK>). NSAIDs are analgesics that inhibit COX enzymes, thereby also inhibiting production of prostaglandins and alleviating cramps (<LINK REF="REF-Dawood-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dawood 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Marjoribanks-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marjoribanks 2015</LINK>). The first drug with this mode of action was aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid), which was introduced in 1899. However, the term 'NSAID' was not used until the 1950s, when phenylbutazone was developed. Since that time, NSAIDs have become more widely used (<LINK REF="REF-Hart-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hart 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Marjoribanks-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marjoribanks 2015</LINK>).</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-12-21 13:30:55 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Despite rigorous searches, we identified only two randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) versus placebo for treatment of women with pain associated with endometriosis. Whether results showed a difference between NSAIDs and placebo for overall pain relief, unintended effects of treatment or requirement for additional medication remains unclear (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>). Investigators provided no data on the other secondary outcomes of this review (quality of life, effects on daily activities, absence from work or school, number of women requiring more invasive treatment, participant satisfaction with treatment). The evidence is surprising, given that NSAIDs are widely prescribed and are bought over the counter for management of pain caused by endometriosis. In comparison, much of the literature suggests that NSAIDs can be used as treatment for women with primary dysmenorrhoea. It is likely that prostaglandins are involved in causing pain in both groups of patients. A recent Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-Marjoribanks-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marjoribanks 2015</LINK>) presented evidence indicating that NSAIDs provide effective treatment for women with pain caused by primary dysmenorrhoea, although women taking NSAIDs must be aware of the risk of unintended effects of treatment.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2016-12-21 13:33:45 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Owing to the lack of RCTs undertaken to explore the use of NSAIDs as treatment for women with pain associated with endometriosis, we are unable to comment on many of the outcomes that are important to women who have endometriosis, such as quality of life, effects on daily activities and absence from school or work. We assessed only four NSAIDs (naproxen sodium, indomethacin, acetylsalicylic acid and tolfenamic acid) for the management of pain associated with endometriosis (<LINK REF="STD-Kauppila-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Kauppila 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kauppila-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Kauppila 1979</LINK>). One trial (<LINK REF="STD-Kauppila-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Kauppila 1979</LINK>) analysed three of these NSAIDs (indomethacin, acetylsalicylic acid and tolfenamic acid), but we did not analyse study findings in this review, as the study had serious methodological flaws. However, many other prescribed and over-the-counter NSAIDs are available. We found no evidence to support use of these to control pain caused by endometriosis.</P>
<P>The only remaining trial (<LINK REF="STD-Kauppila-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Kauppila 1985</LINK>) included and analysed in this review provided no evidence of an effect when comparing NSAIDs (naproxen sodium) versus placebo for the management of pain caused by endometriosis. Evidence was inconclusive to show whether women taking NSAIDs were less likely to take supplementary analgesia than those taking placebo. We believe that this most likely occurred because the trial was very small (randomising only 24 women); therefore, we would recommend caution when these results are applied to a larger population.</P>
<P>Evidence was also inconclusive to show whether women taking NSAIDs were more likely to experience unintended effects of treatment compared with women taking placebo. Four women experienced unintended effects of treatment while taking naproxen sodium compared with seven women who experienced these effects while taking placebo. Unintended effects reported when women were randomised to placebo may have been related to the pain caused by endometriosis, rather than to the placebo itself. However, drawing firm conclusions is difficult because this trial included a small number of women.</P>

<P>Evidence is inconclusive to show whether nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (naproxen sodium) are effective for management of pain caused by endometriosis.

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2016-12-21 13:35:21 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Investigators conducted the two included studies in the late 1970s and the mid 1980s, and randomised small numbers of women. A systematic search of the literature revealed no randomised controlled trials comparing NSAIDs versus other treatments. One trial compared different types of NSAIDs; however, this trial had methodological limitations. Researchers must conduct additional trials with larger numbers of women to ensure that they are of a robust design, and to assess and report outcomes that are important to women with endometriosis (e.g. quality of life, effects on daily activities, absence from school or work, need for more invasive treatment).</P>
