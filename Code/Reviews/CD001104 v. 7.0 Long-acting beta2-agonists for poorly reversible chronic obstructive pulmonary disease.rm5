Discussion amended to report what this review actually found in terms of definition of reversibility.&lt;br&gt;Toby will change WMD to MD and then this is ready for submission.&lt;br&gt;Chris.&lt;br&gt;=======================================================&lt;br&gt;67 references to 23 studies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CJC Edit Mar 24&lt;br&gt;Thanks Toby this is looking good. I have taken myself off the co-reviewers list as I do not think I have done enough to be included on this review. I have also amended the methods in relation to heterogeneity. I do not think you can invoke random effects ONLY if the direction of effect changes. Left in red for you to accept or amend. &lt;br&gt;I still cannot match PEF to outcome 1#6 in the abstract. Please recheck this.&lt;br&gt;In my view this is now a balanced description of the findings without overinterpretation of the significance of the results.&lt;br&gt;I am happy for this to be submitted when you have rechecked the two issues above (left in red).&lt;br&gt;Chris.&lt;br&gt;===============================================================&lt;br&gt;CJC Edit Mar 22 06 TEXT IN RED NEEDS FURTHER ATTENTION PLEASE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Authors' Contributions - fine, am I an author on this review currently - if not I should not be listed under author contributions? Why do Paul, Phillippa and I appear under conflicts of interest????? We are not involved in the trials so what is our conflict?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SECTION REPLACED WITH 'NONE KNOWN'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What's new - clear, but please list the identifiers for the additional studies added to help the reviewer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LIST OF STUDIES ADDED&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Objectives - fine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GOOD&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;References - checked by Liz&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Table of included studies - I think there is a bit of a muddle in the table in relation to allocation concealment. This is not about whether the study is double blind but whether the person allocating the treatment had any way of knowing which treatment arm the next participant would be in until they had been irreversibly entered as participants. The Handbook makes this fairly clear. Could you go back over the studies to assess this directly and alter the table accordingly?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DONE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Metaview Labels - Outcome 1#29 looks very odd; the number of puffs of rescue treatment is at totally different scale to days or nights free and should be separated into a new outcome please.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DONE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Synopsis - Rather long. Subjective comments about clinical significance are best avoided please. Needs revision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DONE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abstract - The FEV1 result matches 3#1 but not 1#1 which is counter intuitive. Which is the primary analysis here? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PRIMARY ANALYSIS IS WITHOUT UNPIBLISHED DATA. HAVE ALTERED THIS. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I cannot locate the reported PEF results from Forest plots. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;#1 OUTCOME #6&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I would suggest taking out the red sentence in the reviewers conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DONE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Background - Reference to asthma could be to recent evidence please.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TWEAKED THE ASTHMA REFERENCE - THIS REFLECTS THE BENEFIT OF LABAS AS ADDITIVE THERAPY.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods - Good to see the clear description of handling of missing variances! Heterogeneity is a problem, as the default statistic in the Forest plots does not comply with you methods. One or other needs changing. (for example 1#1 is fixed in Metaview). Also 3#1 is reported and shown as fixed. Why not say you will also report the random result if there is high I-square? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DONE &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Could you also add a sentence about calculating NNT from the Pooled OR with reference to nntonline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DONE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results - What baseline risk did you use for calculating the NNT. Please specify!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SEE TEXT OF REVIEW&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Discussion - Was Wadbo the only study allowing inhaled steroids in both groups? Please clarify.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NOPE - THERE WERE PLENTY OF OTHERS. I HAVE ADDED A SENTENCE TO THE EFFECT THAT STUDIES WHERE SUSTAINED MAINTENANCE THERAPY WITH THINGS THAT MIOGHT ACTUALLY WORK HAS THE NET EFFECT OF REDUCING THE STATISTICAL POWER OF THE TRIALS BECAUSE YOU WOULD NEED MORE PATIENTS TO FIND A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I HAVE ADDED A NOTE ON WITHDRAWAL DUE TO LACK OF EFFICACY IN THE RESULTS, AND POINTED OUT THAT WE DON'T HAVE ESTIMATES OF EFFECT FOR ADVERSE EVENTS. THIS IS BECAUSE SYSTEMIC EFFECTS IN NON-RESPONDERS MAY BE RELATED TO THE FACT THAT THEY USE MORE OF THE DRUG IN ORDER TO EFFECT SOME KIND OF BRONCHODILATION. THIS MAY BE TRUE, IT MAY NOT. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reviewers Conclusions - the red sentence goes too far and I would remove it. The best summary is the paragraph labelled summary at the end of the discusscion and I would advocate this more cautious style for the abstract and reveiwers conclusions please. Clinical significance can be questioned but certainly cannot be firmly ruled out from the data presented!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DONE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Contentious issues : It is odd to exclude published studies that did not define reversibility but to include unpublished abstracts that did not define reversibility either. Can you get info from GSK on reversibility? Sensitivity analysis is fine for the others but again could now include published trials that do not define reversibility if you want to go this way? I struggled to see where the abstract results came from. Please clarify as above&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;THE DECISION WAS TO EXCLUDE STUDIES WHERE DATA ON REVERSIBILITY INDICATE REVERSIBLE PARTICIPANTS WERE INCLUDED. THE UNPUBLISHED PDFS PERTAIN TO STUDIES WHERE IT WAS NOT CLEAR WHETHER THE PARTICIPANTS WERE REVERSIBLE OR NOT. GIVEN THE COMMERCIAL SENSITVITY HERE I THINK THAT WE CANNOT AFFORD TO BE DOGMATIC AND EXCLUDE NEGATIVE DATA BECAUSE WE ARE APPROACHING THE QUESTION FROM A PARTICULAR ANGLE. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next action - back to Toby.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;---------------------------------------&lt;br&gt;Refs &amp;amp; SS schecked by Liz&lt;br&gt;------------------------------------------&lt;br&gt;Changes made by TJL 240106 based on correspondence with SA and PP: &lt;br&gt;1) Subgrouped the studies by baseline reversibility criterion (those meeting it, and those where it is unclear). The findings provide some mixed insights. Essentially, publication bias only partially accounts for the distribution of effects around the fixed effect (see funnel plot).&lt;br&gt;2) The exclusion of studies where reversibility goes over a certain threshold may be justifiable for efficacy data, but what about safety? If this is beyond the focus of the review there ought to be a good reason - presumably because of the limited availability of data on the non-reversible COPD patients? One possible compromise could be the use of the reversible COPD patients for adverse events (of which there are many in the unpublished studies alone - another potentially interesting form of subgroup analysis!), and their exclusion from the efficacy data which is more likely to drive decision making. The review concludes: 'Clinicians should consider the tradeoffs between the small clinical benefit of long-acting beta-agonists versus the side effect profile....' The review does not establish a benchmark for adverse events - compromise suggested above could help to resolve this. Is there a good reason for suspecting that reversible and non-reversible airways obstruction would lead to different adverse events. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;---------------------------------------------&lt;br&gt;I am staggered at the amount of unpublished data. On second thoughts, I'm not really, considering the previous marginal findings of the review. I agree that they should be incorported into the review, the only nagging concern I have is the nature of the patients- just how reversible they were is not clear. In this respect they can go into the main analyses and then if there is significant I^2 values then maybe those studies can be anyalsed separately?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In re the Mahler 1999 data, the figures you can't find came from a document that our friend Gerry Hagan sent me containing the unpublished data for the non-reversible people in that study. I can't find an electronic version but I will scan what I have and email it on to you if you like.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do you think the TORCH data will be published this year- I know that was the estimated time. It will be interesting to see what they have to report on exacerbations. I'm looking forward to adding that data!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sarah &lt;br&gt;-----------------------------------------------&lt;br&gt;21/12/2005 &amp;amp; 05/01/2006&lt;br&gt;TJL comments: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wot no variance? There are data available from a number of unpublished sources that will greatly help to improve many of the continuous data variables listed in the review. I think the review would benefit hugely from the incorporation of data from these studies (one very large study is listed as ongoing. On eyeballing the data the reason why this has not made it to the public domain becomes a bit clear - this study may have implications for the finding for exacerbations). I think that these studies should feature somewhere, although the definition of COPD is not always explicit. However, there is sufficient information about the study populations in each to merit at least including them as part of a sensitivty analysis. These are: 408DP-03; Dauletbaev 2001; SCO40030; SLMF 4010; SMS40298; SMS40314; SMS40315; SMS40318; Stockley 2003. Furthermore, there are numerous sets of pdfs containing data that are from some of the studies already included in the review that meet the inclusion criteria (Rennard 2001; Chapman 2002; Boyd 1997; Hanania 2003; Calverly 2003; Mahler 1999; Mahler 2002; Ulrik 1995). The list of studies under 'Awaiting assessment' which pertain to unpublished studies contain some data that may likely never make the public domain - should we insist that not enough information is contained in order to consider the studies for inclusion? Or should we be more transparent and maintain that whilst these studies do not contribute numbers to (m)any of the outcomes, they are still RCTs of people with COPD who are given a LABA, and therefore chime with essence of the review, if not actually hit certain threshold criteria. I think that before major surgery is undertaken, these should at least be shared with other reviewers. Some changes are recommended and will only be insisted upon further up the line so I have done these already:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Comparison 01; outcome: 01&lt;br&gt;I have changed this to GIV (generic inverse variance). There are data in the unpublished trial report pdf giving the mean difference and 95% CI. I have entered both the MD and its associated SEM based upon the 95% CI. I have also imputed data for the SDs for Gupta. A small trial anyway, but it looks more authoritative (and potentlally less biased) if the outcomes at least incorporate non-significant data from published studies if there is concern about the availability of unpublished studies (and I think that given the list of studies detailed above, we should assume that this the case).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;01-02&lt;br&gt;Deselected the total for the single study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;01-03&lt;br&gt;The Celli 2003 data for FEV1 are taken from baseline and NOT from outcome - I have deleted this from the review. This study reported no significant change - the AZ website does not have the FEV1 data available (quelle surprise!)&lt;br&gt;Where did the estimate for the Mahler 1999 paper come from? I have been through it and cannot find the values 1.15L or 1.2L anywhere. The pre-BD FEV1 data that are available give an effect going in the other direction. SAL: 1.27 versus PLA: 1.24.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;01-04&lt;br&gt;Changed the crossover data to GIV (means and SDs for crossovers do not take account of the fact that the data are analsyed as within and not between patient differences).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;01-05&lt;br&gt;Pooling change and absolute is a no no. The assumption is that the scales are measuring the same thing, so the mean differences are based on the SDs. However, where you have smaller SDs for mean changes associated with crossovers where there is less between patient variablility, this will give undue weight to those studies for no reason other than they are sensitive to within patient differences, and so rather than reflecting the variance between each study in the weight, the SMD will reflect the sensitivities of the two ways of measuring outcome, i.e. change and absolute. Suggest that this outcome is deleted - it will add nothing more than is contained in the other outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;01-06&lt;br&gt;Changed crossover data to GIV as per 01-04&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;01-08&lt;br&gt;Deselected the total for the single study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;01-09&lt;br&gt;Changed crossover data to GIV as per 01-04. Deselected the total for the single study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;01-10&lt;br&gt;Probably missing outcome data here (see pdf comment above)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;01-16&lt;br&gt;Probably missing outcome data here (see pdf comment above)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;01-17&lt;br&gt;Deselected the total for the single study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;-------------------------------------------------&lt;br&gt;Exported from Review Manager 4.2.8&lt;br&gt;PJP edits 21/12/05&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sorry about the slow edit! It has taken me some time to get to it and its not the easiest piece of work to pick up and put down! I have made some changes ( and some queries / suggestions in italics) as I went through- most in red now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall comments:&lt;br&gt;This is becomeing a very interesting review, and good idea to get it out before TORCH&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Content- I think the finding about sal 50 reducing exacerbations is very significant- have tried to empahsis this more but it does need a bit more work in the discussion section - calculate ARR and NNT. Also might compare wiht tiotropium. Happy to help with this&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Readability- I have tried to enhance it it by making the heading levels more obvious- suggest we might think about including references to the relevant analysis in the text e.g. in brackets next to the heading (0102). Disucssion is a bit repetitive wiht the results section- it need a bit more analysis and placing of things in a broader context*. Certainly the relevance of evidence section needs reworking &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Typos-&lt;br&gt;FEV1 need to have subscript 1&lt;br&gt;I2 needs to have superscript 2&lt;br&gt;Axis labelling 0507, 0508 ned fixing&lt;br&gt;Caps used variably, and are not needed for salmeterol, formoterol, placebo, including on axes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Links-need to get a consisent way to deal with the situation where there are two reports of the same study. There needs to be a link- you will see I tried one way with Ruttn VM and vNoord- you might not like it. Still ned to deal with Jones / Boyd. Another way might be to link to the individual study, having made it really clear in the text that they are the same study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;*I am keen to have another look at the discussion but have run out of time before Xmas- have a good one! &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Please get back if anything is not clear / you disagree!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exported from Review Manager 4.3 Beta&lt;br&gt;Exported from Review Manager 4.2.8&lt;br&gt;Exported from Review Manager 4.2.7&lt;br&gt;Exported from Review Manager 4.2&lt;br&gt;Second look by CJC on 10th July.&lt;br&gt;I am happy with this now and have rechecked Metaview displays and the text results. This can go to Paul for looking at and Peer Review. I think that the conclusion that the main benefit is to those COPD patients who have more reversibility makes sense (hence the insignificant mean benefit but significant benefit when some outcomes are dichotomised) and the bottom-line recommendation is sound - not much difference on average but a few can benefit so try it out and see!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;PJP comments 27th June&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well done- hope we are nearly there-Sarah can you check what you need to and pass on to Chris as I have problems with attachments. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sarah and/or Chris,&lt;br&gt;(i) do we need to include a conflict of interest statement for Paul?&lt;br&gt;Perhaps we should state that editing was done by CJC and PJP - (SA) CHRIS IS&lt;br&gt;DOWN AS EDITOR IN ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS , AND HAVE PUT HIM IN AS CO-AUTHOR.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(ii) Having gone though Jones paper see that data reported in the paper is not the same as in the review esp. in SF36 Salm-50. Do we need a statement as to why there is the discrepancy? further analysis has yielded update in results? The changes will favour the null hypothesis in any case. (SA) THINK WE NEED TO ASK PAUL TO CHECK THIS AS I AM CERTAIN THAT HE CHNGED FIGURES WHEN EDITTING&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(iii) (comparisons 0106 0107) don't need summary of morning and night time PEFR-they are not independent - they measure related outcomes from same study SHOULD I TOTAL THEM- SORRY NOT SURE WHAT YOU MEAN. (PP 27/6) - Correct I don't think you should total them at the bottom as they are the same patients in the same trial and results not independent. (SA 27/6/01) SORRY NOT SURE WHY THEY WERE TOTALLED IN FIRST PLACE, HAVE REMOVED.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(iv) I have amend the following sections content-wise: please check you are happy with these:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abstract-reviewers conclusions YES FINE&lt;br&gt;results- SGRQ: PAUL'S DATA BACK IN- PERSONALLY I DON'T MIND.&lt;br&gt;Implications-significantly reworked YES I LIKE VERY MUCH&lt;br&gt;Conflict of interest YES NECESSARY&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(v) Sarah to change the S's on the graphs YES DONE (27/6/01)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PP comments June with SA reply 19/6 in CAPITALS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am going through and slightly changing text to follow the data and make&lt;br&gt;more clinically usable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A couple of queries before I send update back to you with still a &lt;br&gt;few final things to do:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;please check SD Boyd in comparison 0101-seems very big YES I KNOW. THIS IS&lt;br&gt;BECAUSE THE SE OF THE MEAN CHANGE IN FEV1 WAS SAL 50: 18 MLS SAL 100: 20&lt;br&gt;MLS PLACEBO: 20 MLS WHERE N&amp;gt;200, THE SD = SE x SQUARE ROOT OF N, SDs ARE&lt;br&gt;VERY LARGE.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;also in results the last excluded study -shouldn't we use the study &lt;br&gt;with published data and exclude the unpublished data? THE PUBLISHED&lt;br&gt;VERSION OF THE DATA IS THAT OF RENNARD 2001. WHEN I WROTE TO GERRY HAGAN&lt;br&gt;FROM GWK HE TOLD ME THAT I ALREADY WAS USING THE DATA WHICH WAS PRESENTED&lt;br&gt;IN AN ABSTRACT BY GOODWIN, POOLED WITH THE MAHLER DATA. IT IS THE SAME&lt;br&gt;DATA, IT JUST TOOK GW 4 YEARS TO PUBLISH IT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don't know how we can keep justifying individual mention of &lt;br&gt;studies for some outcomes and not others - I suggest deleting &lt;br&gt;reference to the individual studies except in results and discussion&lt;br&gt;sections. I AM NOT SURE WHAT YOU ARE REFERRING TO HERE. I HAVE REMOVED&lt;br&gt;ALL REFERENCE TO PJ'S SGRQ DATA , (AS RECORDED IN NOTES SECTION), EXCEPT&lt;br&gt;FROM THE DISCUSSION WHEN TRYING TO EXPLAIN THE HETEROGENEITY OBSERVED IN&lt;br&gt;THE SGRQ RESULT. I ONLY MENTION INDIVIDUAL STUDY DATA WHEN 1) IT IS UNABLE&lt;br&gt;TO BE POOLED WITH ANYTHING ELSE, 2) WHEN DATA IS NOT ABLE TO BE ENTERED&lt;br&gt;INTO REVMAN BECAUSE IT IS A MEDIAN, 3) WHEN DATA IS FROM A CROSS-OVER&lt;br&gt;STUDY. ARE YOU SAYING THAT IF WE POOL USING SMD'S THEN WE SHOULD GET RID&lt;br&gt;OF ALL OTHER INDIVIDUAL RESULTS WHICH COMPRISE THAT SMD? I DON'T FANCY&lt;br&gt;THIS AS I DON'T LIKE SMD ANALYSES AND I THINK THAT THE WMD OF, FOR&lt;br&gt;EXAMPLE, 2 STUDIES WITH CHANGE IN FEV1 MUCH MORE INFORMATIVE AND&lt;br&gt;MEANINGFUL THAN AN SMD INCLUDING OTHER MEASURES OF fev1.&lt;br&gt;PP27/6 - I meant in the abstract and implications sections- have changed these. OK , SORRY.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chris, do we need to include a conflict of interest statement for Paul?&lt;br&gt;Perhaps we should state that editing was done by CJC and PJP - CHRIS IS&lt;br&gt;DOWN AS EDITOR IN ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS , AND HAVE PUT HIM IN AS CO-AUTHOR.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I must say I am getting to the stage where I don't think we can say &lt;br&gt;there is any great benefit of Salm at all in COPD-all very minimal &lt;br&gt;effects when pooled. I AGREE AND ISN'T THAT WHAT WE ARE SAYING OR SHOULD&lt;br&gt;WE BE MORE UPFRONT ABOUT IT?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once you get it my update version back:&lt;br&gt;1. will need links in abstract I THOUGHT THAT THE ABSTRACT WASN'T&lt;br&gt;SUPPOSED TO HAVE LINKS?? (PP 26/6) OK will take the bracket out. 2.don't need summary of morning and night time&lt;br&gt;PEFR-they are not independent - they measure related outcomes from same&lt;br&gt;study (comparisons 0106 0107) SHOULD I TOTAL THEM- SORRY NOT SURE WHAT YOU&lt;br&gt;MEAN. 3. still some graphs with capital s Salmeterol I'M SURE THAT I WENT THROUGH&lt;br&gt;EVERY OUTCOME LAST TIME AND CORRECTED. FOUND 4 CAPITAL S. SORRY WILL&lt;br&gt;CORRECT AGAIN.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have to get this absolutely right as drug coys and others will &lt;br&gt;have no hesitation in baying for blood if it is wrong- not a good feel -&lt;br&gt;YES I AGREE!!!!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SLA's response to CJC comments 15/6/2001&lt;br&gt;Technical editing by CJC 29/5/2001&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Dear Sarah and Phillippa,&lt;br&gt;I have spent some time on this as Paul has a possible conflict of interest&lt;br&gt;here!! Can you look at the following and make changes as you see fit.&lt;br&gt;Please then return to Steve Milan.&lt;br&gt;1. TABLE OF COMPARISONS: Could you check the data entry and graph labels for the change scores in this review. I think there may still be some data entry here that is entered with negative labels and I am not sure if this is because the scores fell (representing improvement as a lower score) -YES- &lt;br&gt;or because they rose as the patients improved in their QOL but the data has been entered as negatives -NO - &lt;br&gt;to try to preserve the convention of left of the line shows treatment works. If the latter is the case could the negatives be removed? This needs checking for comparison 1 outcomes 10 to 18 and comparison 2 alloutcomes. OK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;COMPARISON 1:&lt;br&gt;OUTCOME 10. OK - WITH BDI AND TDI, HIGHER SCORES ARE BETTER.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OUTCOME 11=DICHOTOMOUS: BORG&amp;lt;3 . -SINCE LOWER SCORES ARE BETTER, IT IS PREFERABLE TO HAVE LARGER N IN THE TREATMENT GROUP AS SHOWN, AS OPPOSED TO USUAL DICHOTOMOUS OUTCOMES EG DEATHS . THE &amp;quot;FAVOURING SALMETEROL&amp;quot; HAS TO BE ON THE RIGHT SIDE OTHERWISE THE RESULT FAVOURS PLACEBO WHICH IT CLEARLY DOESN'T.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OUTCOME 12 AND 13- YES SORRY, WAS MISLABLED, HAVE SWAPPED AXES LABELS AROUND.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OUTCOME 14: CHANGE IN SGRQ: I HAVEN'T CHANGED THE SIGNS AS IMPROVEMENT IS INDICATED BY NEGATIVE CHANGE IN SCORES. THE WMD INDICATES THAT SALMETEROL PRODUCES GREATER REDUCTION IN SCORES WHICH IS BETTER.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OUTCOME 15: CHANGE IN SF-36: YES MISLABELLED. &lt;br&gt;BUT I THINK PAUL JONES PUT THIS DATA IN THE REVIEW, . I HAVE CHANGED THE SIGNS AND SWAPPED AXIS LABELS SO THAT THERE ARE POSITIVE WMDS FAVOURING SALMETEROL AND NEGATIVE WMDS FAVOURING PLACEBO. &lt;br&gt;I HAVE NOTICED THAT ROLE PHYSICAL SHOWS SIG EFFECT FAVOURING SALMETEROL AND IN THE TEXT I'VE GOT &amp;quot;GENERAL HEALTH AS MEASURED BY THE SF-36 DID NOT IMPROVE IN ANY OF THE EIGHT COMPONENTS&amp;quot;. !!!! &lt;br&gt;HAS BEEN CORRECTED IN RESULTS AND DISCUSSION. SORRY DON'T KNOW HOW THIS HAS HAPPENED.&lt;br&gt;AGAIN, I THINK PAUL ENTERED THIS DATA WHEN EDITTING, WHICH IS SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT FROM DATA I EXTRACTED FROM A TABLE IN HIS PAPER. PAUL MIGHT HAVE TO LOOK AT THIS AFTER ALL DESPITE HIS CONFLICT OF INTEREST. I THINK WE NEED TO KNOW WHY IT IS DIFFERENT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OUTCOME 16: CHANGE IN CRQ: NO CHANGES TO MAKE. SALMETEROL GROUP GOT WORSE AS INDICATED BY NEGATIVE WMDS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OUTCOME 17: ABSOLUTE CRQ SCORES: PERFECTLY OK&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OUTCOME 18: HRQL SMD- SAME AS 17&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;COMPARISON 2: 100 MCG SALMETEROL&lt;br&gt;OUTCOME 1: CHANGE FEV1- YES NEEDED CHANGING- SALMETEROL MEAN= +89 MLS, PLACEBO MEAN= -29 MLS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OUTCOME 2: BORG SCORE &amp;lt;3 : PERFECTLY OK&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OUTCOME 3:CHANGE IN SGRQ- NO CHANGES MADE TO PLOT, NOT NECESSARY. JUST A STATEMENT SAYING THAT -VE WMD INDICATE IMPROVEMENT AND +VE WMD INDICATE WORSENING.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OUTCOME 4: SF-36 SCORES- NO CHANGES MADE TO PLOT, NOT NECESSARY. JUST A STATEMENT SAYING THAT +VE WMD INDICATE IMPROVEMENT AND -VE WMD INDICATE WORSENING. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;THERE IS WORSE TO COME- THE VITALITY COMPONENT IS NOW NOT SIG DIFFERENT! FIXED IN RESULTS AND DISCUSSION.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I HONESTLY DON'T KNOW WHAT IS HAPPENING HERE. I UPDATED THE VERSION WHICH WAS ON THE CLIB! HOW THERE CAN BE SUCH DISCREPANCIES BETWEEN PLOTS AND TEXT IS A COMPLETE MYSTERY TO ME. AGAIN, I THINK THAT PAUL SHOULD LOOK AT THIS BECAUSE OF THE DISCREPANCIES IN THE DATA COMPARED TO THAT PUBLISHED. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Borg score labelling is not consistent as salmeterol is better to the right for raw scores and for scores &amp;lt;3 (both cannot be correct?) The ones that I think are mislabelled are 1-12 and 1-15 and 2-1and 2-4? SEE ABOVE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As far as I can tell CRQ and SF-36 both are better with high scores YES &lt;br&gt;and Borg and SGRQ are the opposite YES. I am not sure about the transitional breathlessness scores. HIGHER=BETTER&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. DESCRIPTION OF STUDIES: Can you make clear that the reversible patients in the Mahler study have not been included in the data. STATED IN TABLE OF INCLUDED STUDIES, BUT HAVE PUT THE SAME STATEMENT IN THE DESCRIPTION OF STUDIES. &lt;br&gt;Also I cannot tell if the van Molken and van Noord studies were on the same patients which would then be double counted if pooled - could this be made clearer too? Did you avoid pooling or did this not arise because the reported outcomes were&lt;br&gt;all different. ORIGINALLY STATED IN DESCRIPTION OF STUDIES, &amp;quot;DATA FOR THE TWO NETHERLANDS STUDIES (R-VAN MOLKEN 1999; VAN NOORD 2000) WERE DERIVED FROM THE SAME STUDY BUT EACH REPORTED DIFFERENT OUTCOMES&amp;quot;. CHANGED TO &amp;quot;DATA FOR THE TWO NETHERLANDS STUDIES (R-VAN MOLKEN 1999; VAN NOORD 2000) WERE DERIVED FROM ONE RCT BUT EACH REPORTED DIFFERENT OUTCOMES&amp;quot;. HENCE DOUBLE COUNTING NOT AN ISSUE.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also could you say which 2 studies were crossover? YES, DONE (ULRIK, GROVE)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. RESULTS: You say in the methods section that you will use random effects model if there is significant heterogeneity; there is in the FEV1 SMD outcome and when analysed with a random model the difference is not significant - SMD 0.14 (-0.16 to 0.44). May I suggest this result needs to be rewritten. YES, CORRECTED: &amp;quot;USING A RANDOM EFFECTS MODEL THERE WAS NO SIGNIFICANT TREATMENT EFFECT SMD 0.14 (-0.16 TO 0.44)&amp;quot;. THE DISCUSSION CORRECTED ALSO. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I find it confusing to have WMD in ml for Boyd and Litres for the other studies. HAVE CHANGED TO LITRE, BUT NOT REALLY HAPPY AS WE ARE LOSING INFORMATION BY HAVING TO ROUND UP FIGURES.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think Goodwin and Mahler report CHANGE from baseline at 12 weeks (not as written baseline FEV1 at 12 weeks). -NO. DATA I OBTAINED FROM GLAXO WERE ABSOLUTE VALUES.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CI for Ulrich PEF pm should be -23.4,33.4 . YES, SORRY ABOUT THAT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I cannot understand the SGRQ results - you seem to have reported just the Jones results in the third sentence (This showed significant improvement....) NOW DELETED. ORIGINALLY I LEFT THIS IN AS I HOPED THAT PAUL WOULD HAVE SOME COMMENT AS THE POOLED RESULT CONTRADICTS HIS AND I CAN'T EXPLAIN IT. &lt;br&gt; NOW : &amp;quot;ST. GEORGES RESPIRATORY QUESTIONNAIRE (SGRQ)- HEALTH RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE WAS ASSESSED IN TWO STUDIES (JONES 1997; R-VAN MOLKEN 1999) WITH THE SGRQ (JONES 1992). IN BOTH STUDIES, THE PRIMARY AUTHORS USED AN ANALYSIS OF COVARIANCE CONTROLLING FOR DIFFERENCES IN BASELINE SCORES. USING THE SGRQ, A NEGATIVE SCORE INDICATES IMPROVEMENT. POOLED ANALYSIS OF CHANGE IN SGRQ SCORES (USING A RANDOM EFFECTS MODEL BECAUSE OF HETEROGENEITY IN THE IMPACTS AND TOTAL DOMAINS) DEMONSTRATED NO SIGNIFICANT RESPONSE OF ANY OF THE SGRQ DOMAINS -TOTAL, SYMPTOMS, ACTIVITY AND IMPACTS, TO TREATMENT. [(WMD TOTAL=-2.93, 95% CI:-7.72, 1.86); (WMD SYMPTOMS=-2.17, 95% CI:-6.08, 1.73); (WMD ACTIVITY=-0.74, 95% CI:-3.77, 2.28); (WMD IMPACTS=-4.25, 95% CI:-11.7, 3.19)&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;and in the pooled results again you should give the results of the random effects model analysis THOUGHT I HAD, SORRY, NOW CHANGED TO REM IN RESULTS AS BELOW as there is heterogeneity and this is not then significant: WMD -4.25 (-11.7 to 3.19). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Could you discuss with Phillippa whether we should put in individual study results when we have pooled data to report???? I HAVE REMOVED PJ'S RESULT COMPLETELY AND LEFT A COMMENT IN DISCUSSION. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the 100mcg outcomes the results for FEV1 at 16 weeks do not match the Metaview data (WMD 58ml 95% CI 4.48 to 111.55) - which is correct please? FIXED -MISTAKE IN THE SIGNS IN THE DATA TABLE, WMD=116 ML.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The SF-36 data does not agree either. SEE ABOVE COMPARISON 2, OUTCOME 4.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;4. DISCUSSION: Can you justify your arguement that LABAs are of little or no&lt;br&gt;clinical benefit? SMD pooled FEV1 is not significant with a random model. Likewise impacts in SGRQ. &lt;br&gt;1. INCONSISTENT BENEFITS IN LUNG FUNCTION AND WHEN PRESENT IN 2 OUT OF 8 STUDIES OF QUESTIONABLE CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE.&lt;br&gt;2.HRQL- NO SIG BENEFITS EXCEPT IN 3 OF 4 STUDIES USING 2 DISEASE SPECIFIC INSTRUMENTS AND ONE GENERAL MEASURE. ONE STUDY SHOWED SOME CLINICALLY SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN ONLY 2 OF 4 DOMAINS.&lt;br&gt;3. DYSPNOEA - ONLY ONE STUDY DEMONSTRATED LESS PERCEIVED BREATHLESSNESS ON EXERCISE - NOT MEAN DATA BUT NUMBER OF SUBJECTS ETC SUGGESTING DREDGING FOR DATA.&lt;br&gt;4. SYMPTOM SCORES- SOME BENEFIT- ONE STUDY DAYTIME SYMPTOMS ONLY, MEDIAN SCORES LOWER WITH SALMETEROL IN 1 STUDY AND ONE STUDY -DISTRIBUTION OF SCORES DIFFERENT, IMPLYING WHAT? SALMETEROL BETTER OR WORSE?&lt;br&gt;5. EXACERBATIONS - NUMBER OF SUBJECTS WITH AT LEAST ONE EXACERBATION NOT SIG DIFFERENT IN TWO STUDIES - ONE LARGE, ONE SMALL.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I cannot agree that this review &amp;quot;has demonstrated that exacerbations are not preventable as a result of salmeterol therapy&amp;quot; as&lt;br&gt;you cannot prove a negative! &lt;br&gt;YES SEE POINT. CHANGED FROM &amp;quot;This review however, has demonstrated that exacerbations are not preventable as a result of salmeterol therapy and the rationale for using LABA therapy in this case is doubtful&amp;quot; TO &amp;quot;This review however, has demonstrated that exacerbations were not reduced with salmeterol treatment compared to placebo treatment. The duration of treatment in these studies ranged from four to 12 weeks and it is probable that to detect a change in exacerbation rate a longer study duration is necessary&amp;quot;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;comments by PJP 8 May 2001&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well done! I have edited grammar, typos and syntax and a few other bits as I have gone through&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Main points and queries/suggestions for SA:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. Please change capital S on salmeterol to small one on metaview graphs&lt;br&gt;2. not sure why there are no statistics in the summry metaview for 0101, 0102, 0106, 0107-is it becuse there is only one study. If so need to be consistent in 0201, 0205 you do have statistics&lt;br&gt;3. are there studies which had data but didn't report SDs? if so these can be included in the metaview for comparative purposes even though weight is zero and a red cross appears by the study. helps to see other means alongside the usable ones.&lt;br&gt;4.check confidence intervals in results section-paragraph on lung function and ex test line 3-wrong interval &lt;br&gt;5. could one explanation of the difference in SGRQ seen with the Jones study be that he used analysis of covariance-we should include this in the explanations. I think he feels this may contribute.&lt;br&gt;6.were any adverse effects noted in the studies-this would be helpful to comment on in the discussion esp as no effect seen with higher dose, suggesting there may be other factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;I have modified slightly for clarity and meaning. Hope you agree-please discuss if not!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. in Objectives-put exercise testing on sep line to lung function&lt;br&gt;2. data analysis line 4 onwards altered&lt;br&gt;3. deleted &amp;quot;trend&amp;quot; in sal 100 HRQL ( either significant or not)&lt;br&gt;4. changed synopsis slightly&lt;br&gt;5. changed last line in discussion&lt;br&gt;6. changed implications for research&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;look forward to your responses to these!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;well done&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Phillippa&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CHANGES MADE ACCORDING TO PHILLIPPA'S RECOMMENDATIONS&lt;br&gt;MAY 2001.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;1. All graph titles changed to salmeterol and placebo, all in lower case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. I have fixed the summary statistics and yes I hadn't totalled these outcomes as there was only one study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. With this review, I wasn't missing SD data, only the raw data for outcomes reported as medians, so I haven't put in any means for comparison.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;4. Fixed the problem with the CI by making the FEV1 WMD mls instead of litres of FEV1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;5. w/r to the problems in the SGRQ, both studies used an analysis of covariance to control for baseline differences. I have put a statement in both the results section and the discussion (para 4 line 2- on full screen view)&lt;br&gt;I have also put in a statement re the proportion of subjects with a minimal clinical change in Total scores to show the difference between the studies. (in the discussion /HRQL/ last two sentences of second paragraph or just before the discussion of CRQ scores)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;6. Have looked at the adverse event data- new paragraph in discussion, 3rd from bottom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Points 1-6 modified for clarity and meaning- Yes very good and perfectly fine with me.&lt;br&gt;Sarah.&lt;br&gt;______________________&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Short title (no longer in use): Long acting beta2-adrenoceptor agonists for C copy&lt;br&gt;CJC checklist 27/8/99&lt;br&gt;Reviewers contributions - OK&lt;br&gt;What's new dates - OK&lt;br&gt;Synopsis - COPD should not be abbreviated at its first mention&lt;br&gt;Abstract background - ditto&lt;br&gt;Metaview labels - fine.&lt;br&gt;AS FAR AS I CAN SEE YOU HAVE LABELLED THE LUNG FUNCTION TESTS AS NEGATIVE IN ORDER TO MAKE THE OUTCOMES ADVERSE. THIS IS OK IF IT IS MADE CLEAR IN THE TEXT BUT IS VERY CONFUSING WHEN YOU REFER IN THE TEXT TO FEV1 IMPROVING WITH TREATMENT BUT THE WMD IS REPORTED AS A NEGATIVE FIGURE (WHICH IT IS NOT IN REAL LIFE). AS IT IS NOW POSSIBLE TO LABEL EACH OUTCOME SEPARATELY I WONDER IF YOU SHOULD EITHER MAKE ALL THE DATA AS REAL POSITIVE NUMBERS AND CHANGE THE GRAPH LABELS SO THE WMD IS POSITIVE FOR IMPROVEMENT, OR AT THE LEAST CHANGE THE TEXT SO WMD IS REPORTED WITH THE CORRECT SIGN IN THE TEXT???????&lt;br&gt;I am sorry that this means more work but I will have to do the same in my review and this seems the opportune time to sort this one out, if you have space to do it!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CHANGES MADE TO REVIEW: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Synopsis - COPD should not be abbreviated at its first mention&lt;br&gt;Abstract background - ditto&lt;br&gt;I changed the signs on the continuous outcomes so that -ve WMD are not generated and I also swapped the axis labels around in metaview. I changed the WMDs accordingly in the text for FEV1, PEFR and six minute walk distance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;23/9/99 rechecked by CJC and looks great.

<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2008-08-01 17:55:05 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>This review aims to determine the effectiveness of long-acting beta-agonists, salmeterol or formoterol, in the treatment of COPD (emphysema/chronic bronchitis). These drugs improve airflow in the lungs, and enable people with COPD to get on with their daily activities. Twenty-four studies (6061 participants) reported the effects of LABAs in people with COPD. People taking salmeterol 50 mcg daily do have fewer exacerbations than those on placebo, and some improvement in lung function and certain quality of life scores. The findings were not consistent enough to support a general recommendation for the use of these drugs in the group of people with COPD with minimal variation in their lung function, although there is some evidence of improvement in important outcomes and these findings require further exploration in additional trials.</P>
</SUMMARY_BODY>
</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is characterised by partially reversible airflow limitation. Many patients have little reversibility to short acting bronchodilators, but long acting bronchodilators are frequently advocated.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To determine the effectiveness of long acting beta-2 adrenoceptor agonists (LABAs) in COPD patients demonstrating poor reversibility to short-acting bronchodilators.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>The Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register was searched ('all years' to 2005) along with the reference lists from identified randomised controlled trials (RCTs). </P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>All RCTs comparing inhaled LABAs (salmeterol or formoterol) with placebo in the treatment of patients with stable, poorly reversible COPD. Studies were a minimum of four weeks in duration.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Two authors independently performed data extraction and study quality assessment. If we required additional data, we contacted authors and pharmaceutical companies sponsoring the identified RCTs.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Twenty-three published and unpublished studies (6061 participants) were included in the review. There was a significant change in forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) in favour of salmeterol 50 mcg twice daily (BID) of 51 mls (95% confidence intervals (CI) 32 to 70), end of study morning peak expiratory flow (PEF) 14.89 L/min (95% CI 10.86 to 18.91). Supplemental short-acting bronchodilator usage was reduced by just under one puff per day. There were significant differences in the total, activity and impact domain scores of the St George's respiratory questionnaire in favour of salmeterol 50 mcg BID. Findings from other health status measurements and symptom scores were conflicting. There was no significant difference in exercise tolerance. The number of participants experiencing exacerbations was significantly reduced with salmeterol 50 mcg treatment compared with placebo (numbers needed to treat to benefit 24).</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>This review shows that the treatment of patients with COPD with salmeterol 50 mcg produces modest increases in lung function. There were varying effects for other important outcomes such as health related quality of life or reduction in symptoms. However, there was a consistent reduction in exacerbations which may help people with COPD who suffer frequent deterioration of symptoms prompting healthcare utilisation. The strength of evidence for the use of salmeterol 100 mcg, formoterol 12 mcg, 18 mcg, 24 mcg was insufficient to provide clear indications for practice.</P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
</ABSTRACT>
<BODY MODIFIED="2012-11-21 10:02:30 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<BACKGROUND>
<P>COPD is characterised by airways obstruction that is not fully reversible. Even though many patients have a poor response to short acting bronchodilators, long-acting beta-2 adrenoceptor agonists are increasingly recommended for administration to all patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) as regular long term therapy. These drugs are beneficial as additive maintenance therapy in the reversible airflow obstruction which occurs in asthma (<LINK REF="REF-Ni-Chroinin-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ni Chroinin 2005</LINK>). It is important to establish whether this class of drugs has any benefit in COPD, particularly as they are relatively expensive to the health system. There are clear cost implications for healthcare budgets of prescribing long-acting beta agonists and thus it is important to evaluate if there are any clear clinical benefits of use in terms of lung function, exercise tolerance, quality of life, exacerbations and rescue short acting beta-agonist use. We therefore aim to review the literature to determine the evidence of the efficacy of this medication in patients with COPD who have a poor spirometric response to short acting bronchodilator.</P>

<P>Trials potentially suitable for inclusion in the review included all published and non-published randomised controlled trials of parallel group or crossover design that were identified from titles, abstracts and keywords of references obtained in the literature search.

<P>Two authors extracted data from the trials independently, without blinding of authorship, onto standardised data extraction sheets. Qualitative data included the author, year of publication, setting, duration of study, baseline characteristics of participants and withdrawals. Quantitative data included dichotomous and continuous outcome measures. Standard errors were converted to standard deviations. We contacted authors and pharmaceutical companies sponsoring identified in an attempt to obtain missing and raw data. Data were estimated from graphs for some outcomes if values were not reported in the paper and we were unable to obtain the information from the authors.</P>

<P>Data were entered into Review Manager software by one author and checked by a second author. For dichotomous outcomes, we expressed results of the analyses as an odds ratio (OR, 95% confidence intervals (CI)). For continuous outcomes, results of the analyses were expressed as a mean difference (MD, 95% CI) or a standardised mean difference (SMD, 95% CI). SMDs were utilised to conduct pooled analysis of outcomes if there was variation in the method of reporting of those outcomes. If a more positive outcome is favourable (e.g. FEV1, CRDQ) data were entered as positive values to generate positive MDs. In this case, the titles of the horizontal axes have been reversed so that effects that favour the treatment under review move to the right.</P>
<P>We have calculated a number needed to treat to benefit (NNTB) for efficacy outcomes and a number needed to treat to harm (NNTH) for safety variables.

<P>Twenty-three studies met the eligibility criteria of the review. These studies recruited 6061 participants. </P>
<P>There were 15 published RCTs identified describing the effects of LABAs, administered via inhalation over at least four weeks to adults with poorly reversible COPD. Two definitions for reversibility to a short-acting beta agonist were considered in this review. Reversibility to a short acting beta agonist was defined as a less than 15% reversibility of FEV1 from baseline in eleven studies including the <LINK REF="STD-Ulrik-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Ulrik 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Grove-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Grove 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Boyd-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Boyd 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mahler-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Mahler 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-van-Noord-2000" TYPE="STUDY">van Noord 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rennard-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Rennard 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rossi-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Rossi 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gupta-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Gupta 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mahler-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Mahler 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Celli-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Celli 2003</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Hanania-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Hanania 2003</LINK> studies.

<P>An additional subset of eight unpublished RCTs have also been identified following hand searching of the GSK online trials register (<LINK REF="STD-_x0034_08DP_x002d_03" TYPE="STUDY">408DP-03</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dauletbaev-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Dauletbaev 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-SCO40030" TYPE="STUDY">SCO40030</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-SMS40298" TYPE="STUDY">SMS40298</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-SMS40314" TYPE="STUDY">SMS40314</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-SMS40315" TYPE="STUDY">SMS40315</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-SMS40318" TYPE="STUDY">SMS40318</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stockley-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Stockley 2002</LINK>).

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2008-08-14 14:04:04 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>This review aimed to determine the effectiveness of LABAs in COPD patients who demonstrate poor reversibility to short-acting bronchodilators. The presence of increased resistance to airflow from airways obstruction is a characteristic of COPD. Although effective as an additive agent in asthma (<LINK REF="REF-Ni-Chroinin-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ni Chroinin 2005</LINK>), salmeterol and formoterol are frequently advocated in the treatment of patients with COPD, where the acute response to bronchodilators in COPD is often minimal.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Respiratory Function</HEADING>
<P>This review found statistically significant changes in favour of salmeterol for some lung function outcomes (change in FEV1, change in FEV1 (% predicted), change in PEF and end of study morning PEF). The clinical meaning of these differences, and their relationship with other variables such as quality of life and exacerbations, are yet to be established. The discrepancy between change and end of treatment FEV1 outcomes may be explained by the natural adjustment of imbalance between groups at baseline with change scores, and the superior statistical power derived from the larger number of studies (2026 versus 1468 participants). The effect of long-acting beta-agonists in COPD patients who have a reversible component for their airways disease to short acting beta agonists is outside the scope of this review. However, this review included studies with both groups of participants that were stratified by reversibility to short acting beta-agonist. This included the <LINK REF="STD-Mahler-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Mahler 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rennard-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Rennard 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mahler-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Mahler 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rossi-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Rossi 2002</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Hanania-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Hanania 2003</LINK> trials. These studies reported greater improvement in lung function in the subgroup with reversibility to short acting beta agonist versus the subgroup with poor reversibility.</P>
<P>The treatment period in the crossover studies should be of sufficient duration to detect improvements, but none were observed. The absence of demonstrable effect in these studies may be due to small sample sizes, which have less power to detect change.</P>
<P>In advanced COPD, exertional dyspnoea has been correlated with the level of dynamic lung hyperinflation (DH) (<LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Donnell-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Donnell 1997</LINK>). One study has demonstrated that Inspiratory Capacity (IC) correlates better with improvements in exercise tolerance and reduces dyspnoea than expiratory flow measurements (<LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Donnell-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Donnell 1999</LINK>). The improvements in IC and exercise tolerance (after ipratropium treatment) occurred in a proportion of participants (31%) who showed little or no improvement in FEV1 (&lt; 10% predicted). Utilisation of FEV1 measurements in the studies in this review may therefore have underestimated the potential benefits of LABA therapy. However, the lack of improvement in exercise tolerance suggests this is not the case.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Exercise Tolerance, HRQoL and Symptom scores</HEADING>
<P>Traditionally the efficacy of bronchodilator medication has been assessed in terms of changes in airflow obstruction using spirometry and peak flow measures. However, exercise tolerance, HRQL and symptom scores are important outcomes for people with COPD, and areas where one would hope to see significant improvements with LABAs. This review showed inconsistent effects of LABA across the reported outcomes.</P>
<P>The SGRQ was designed to allow direct comparisons of the health gain obtainable with therapies in asthma and COPD (<LINK REF="REF-Jones-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jones 1992</LINK>). Being a disease specific HRQL instrument it is sensitive to treatment related improvements. The size of the treatment effects for change in total, activity and impact domains were small and the level of improvement did not exceed the four unit difference as a threshold for clinical significance in total SGRQ or its components (<LINK REF="REF-Jones-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jones 1991</LINK>). Deselecting <LINK REF="STD-Boyd-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Boyd 1997</LINK> reduced the level of statistical heterogeneity indicating that a higher compliance rate with medication in this study or a more reversible group of participants, may have led to better outcomes with salmeterol. This study showed clinically significant improvements for the SGRQ total score and the impacts domain for the salmeterol 50 mcg group but not for the 100 mcg group suggesting that adverse effects participants experience at the higher dose may outweigh the benefits. Following the addition of new data, random-effects modelling did not alter the direction of summary estimates in the domains of the SGRQ. The difference between subgroups when defined by the availability of reversibility criteria ('known to meet the review criteria' versus 'unclear') were significant according to the t test. However, the within subgroup I2 statistic for total SGRQ score was indicative of a heterogeneous subgroup of studies. Due to the unclear baseline reversibility thresholds, the influence of possible 'reversible' participants on the findings could vary between the unpublished studies.</P>
<P>The Chronic Respiratory Diseases Questionnaire (CRDQ) is a HRQL instrument COPD that measures both physical and emotional attributes. It is a seven point scale where a change of 0.5 units represents a clinically small change, 1.0 represents a moderate change and 1.5 represents a large change. A statistically significant and clinically large change in the fatigue and dyspnoea domains was detected in the salmeterol 50 mcg group. The reason behind the large statistical heterogeneity in the dyspnoea group is unclear.</P>
<P>The SF-36 questionnaire is a generic HRQL instrument that assesses eight domains. The two studies investigating salmeterol 50 mcg presented SF-36 scores differently, thus limiting opportunities for meta-analysis. In general, the SF-36 was unable to detect improvements in quality of life after salmeterol treatment, except in a few domains. <LINK REF="STD-Boyd-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Boyd 1997</LINK>, which detected a clinically significant difference in the total SGRQ score for the salmeterol 50 mcg group, did not detect a difference in the SF-36 questionnaire with the exception of the role physical domain. However, the SF-36 may lack the disease specific sensitivity to detect changes in a population with COPD. <LINK REF="STD-Gupta-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Gupta 2002</LINK> reported that baseline scores for the placebo group tended to be higher than for the salmeterol group and improvement was shown in both the placebo and salmeterol groups. Given the treatment group had a lower baseline score, the improvement may have been heightened.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Exacerbations and withdrawal due to lack of efficacy</HEADING>
<P>A reduction in exacerbations of COPD is one of the aims of all maintenance therapy (<LINK REF="REF-NICE_x002f_BTS-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE/BTS 2004</LINK>). Importantly, this review has demonstrated that the number of participants experiencing exacerbations was reduced with salmeterol 50 mcg treatment compared to placebo treatment (NNTB 21). This finding may be of significance given the relationship between exacerbations and deterioration in health related quality of life in COPD (<LINK REF="REF-Spencer-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spencer 2004</LINK>). The duration of treatment in these studies ranged from 12 to 52 weeks. This effect supports the finding on withdrawal due to lack of efficacy, although the NNTB was suggestive of a lower impact (NNTB 46). This may reflect differing surrogates of disease control and perception of benefit, but remains an important feature of clinical trial design in this population. <LINK REF="STD-Rossi-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Rossi 2002</LINK> (12 months duration) found no significant differences for exacerbation rates for formoterol 12 mcg and 24 mcg versus placebo. More trials with longer study duration are probably necessary to detect a change in exacerbation rate and the <LINK REF="STD-TORCH" TYPE="STUDY">TORCH</LINK> study, a three year study due for publication in 2006 will add important evidence regarding exacerbations and mortality.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Rescue short-acting beta-agonist use</HEADING>
<P>There was a small but statistically significant reduction in number of daytime puffs of salbutamol in the salmeterol 50 mcg group compared with placebo. This is a predictable outcome given the long duration of action of these drugs which may improve medication compliance and reduce patient burden. Rescue medication use in the formoterol 18 mcg study (<LINK REF="STD-Wadbo-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Wadbo 2002</LINK>) showed the placebo group had one additional daily inhalation over the placebo group.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">The quality of the evidence</HEADING>
<P>The majority of studies were of good quality and included multi-centre, multinational trials with varying numbers of participants. The search strategy was rigorous and included American Thoracic Society and European Respiratory Society abstracts. Authors and drug companies involved in trials were contacted in order to obtain any missing or unpublished data. </P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Limitations of the review</HEADING>
<P>Meta-analysis for a number of outcomes were limited. Several factors contributed to this problem: The small number of RCTs available meeting the criteria for inclusion in the review; inconsistent methods of reporting outcomes across studies; lack of provision of numerical data for outcome measures or standard deviations for mean effect sizes were not available. Imputation based on an average standard deviation is one possible countermeasure to censored reporting of data in clinical trials, but we were only able to undertake this in a limited number of outcomes (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>).</P>
<P>Publication bias is a known threat to the validity of any pooled estimate of efficacy (<LINK REF="REF-Sterne-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sterne 2001</LINK>) and we have identified a number of unpublished studies which are analysed in addition to the primary analyses on the published studies. Given the specific nature of COPD we analyse in this review, these studies may not have been conducted according to our entry criteria. However, their availability has enabled to us to assess whether the lack of a description of entry criteria could explain a response differential. The extent to which this was the case varied between the outcomes, and may in part reflect the different primary outcomes they selected, as well as indicating the mixed patient population hitherto excluded from this review.</P>
<P>There was variation in the duration of each of the studies and this may have had some effect on the results. We pooled studies of differing durations of exposure to treatment provided the treatment period was at least four weeks as it was felt that the treatment effect would be evident after four weeks of treatment. However, sensitivity analysis based on study duration was not required for most outcomes as indicated by the low I2 values where meta-analysis was possible. Study duration did not resolve the heterogeneity for outcomes with I2 values greater than 20%.</P>
<P>Individual trials had different requirements for what additional medications were permitted for the participants to use. Some studies allowed patients to continue their non-long acting beta-agonist regular medication if maintained at a constant dose throughout (<LINK REF="STD-Grove-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Grove 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mahler-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Mahler 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chapman-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Chapman 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mahler-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Mahler 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rossi-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Rossi 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stockley-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Stockley 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wadbo-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Wadbo 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Celli-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Celli 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dal-Negro-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Dal Negro 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-_x0034_08DP_x002d_03" TYPE="STUDY">408DP-03</LINK>) permitted participants to continue with theophylline. This is important because the patient may have been taking additional drugs with similar mechanisms of action, the drugs may have additive or synergistic effects, or the benefits conferred by them may have underpowered the studies to find significant effects between long-acting beta-agonist.</P>
<P>We have not collected data on adverse events in this review. It was felt between the authors that the side-effects associated with salmeterol may be affected by bronchodilation such that in a trial setting non-responders may take an extra puff or two of study drugs to achieve some bronchodilation thus potentially increasing in systemic effects. Given that we have only been able to collect data for a subset of poorly reversible participants from many of the studies. This issue remains unclear.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">The relevance of the evidence</HEADING>
<P>This systematic review may differ slightly from other more recent COPD maintenance therapy reviews in that it was only concerned with those patients who have poor reversibility to short-acting bronchodilators (<LINK REF="REF-Nannini-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nannini 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Barr-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barr 2005</LINK>). Recent consensus statements and guidelines have moved away from defining COPD in terms of bronchodilator response, and instead promote symptom history over spirometric findings in the definition and diagnosis of COPD. Airways obstruction is instead described as being not fully reversible (<LINK REF="REF-GOLD-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">GOLD 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-ATS_x002f_ERS-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">ATS/ERS 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NICE_x002f_BTS-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE/BTS 2004</LINK>). The findings of this review may not therefore apply directly to recent 'guideline' defined COPD. Although the validity of the reversible/non-reversible dichotomy has been called in to question (<LINK REF="REF-Calverley-2003b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Calverley 2003b</LINK>), the progressive nature of the disease, and the mechanism of beta-agonists justify selecting out those patients in whom these drugs are recommended, but whose initial response to beta-agonist does not suggest that lung function will improve. The response of such people to maintenance beta-agonist therapy has been explored in only a subset of trials. We defined poorly reversible COPD as an increase in FEV1 of &lt; 200ml and &lt; 15% of the baseline or percent predicted FEV1 after a short acting beta agonist. Studies in which the definition of reversibility were unclear were identified for sensitivity analysis, because the study population potentially includes a subset of participants who may have a larger reversible component of their disease. Whilst certain domains of the SGRQ gave more positive effects from the unclear studies (i.e. symptoms and total score), the effect on lung function, rescue bronchodilator usage, symptom scores, peak flow, and exacerbations did not reach statistical significance with data from studies applying unclear reversibility criteria. </P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Summary</HEADING>
<P>This review has found evidence that long-acting beta-agonist treatment in people with poorly reversible COPD leads to statistically significant improvements in lung function, quality of life, symptom scores and significantly fewer exacerbations. The clinical relevance of these effects may be small, and should be borne in mind when deciding whether this treatment option is a viable maintenance therapy in people with COPD. Future trials are likely to recruit people with COPD defined more by symptom and smoking histories, and may therefore be less reliant on spirometry as a guide to assessing acute response to bronchodilator therapy. The role of long-acting beta agonists in the treatment of COPD may become limited as other more potent therapies such as combination therapies show impressive effects over mono components, including salmeterol and formoterol (<LINK REF="REF-Nannini-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nannini 2004</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>The evidence considered in this review only relates to those patients with poorly reversible COPD. In these patients who are treated with salmeterol 50 mcg there is a small statistically significant improvement in lung function. In the absence of evidence as to whether this difference is meaningful, this effect is of uncertain clinical significance. There were some benefits in quality of life measures and reduction in symptoms. Exacerbations and rescue salbutamol use were both reduced following treatment with salmeterol 50 mcg for at least four weeks. People who suffer frequent deterioration in symptoms prompting additional medication usage could benefit from this therapy. The strength of evidence for the use of salmeterol 100 mcg, formoterol 12 mcg, 18 mcg, 24 mcg was insufficient to provide clear guidance for practice. Clinicians should consider the trade-offs between the possibly small clinical benefit of long-acting beta-agonists versus the side effect profile and financial cost for the individual patient. </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Longer term studies than those in this systematic review (for example <LINK REF="STD-TORCH" TYPE="STUDY">TORCH</LINK>) are needed to assess more fully the effect on exacerbations and health care utilisation, before more definite conclusions can be drawn. In addition to measures of symptoms, studies should include a measure of exercise tolerance and HRQL with perhaps less emphasis on FEV1 given emerging evidence. Cost-benefit analysis is also an important outcome. Further studies are needed to clarify whether the positive responses observed (improved health status and reduced breathlessness) with LABA therapy are related to FEV1 reversibility status of participants/inclusion of asthmatics in these studies. This will require the incorporation of measurements of lung hyperinflation in spirometric assessments. </P>

<APPENDIX_BODY MODIFIED="2008-08-14 10:05:00 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>The procedures for randomising GSK sponsored studies has been detailed in correspondence between Richard Follows and TL, the details of which are given below:</P>
<P>The randomisation software is a computer-generated, centralised programme (RandAll). After verification that the randomisation sequence is suitable for the study design (crossover, block or stratification), Clinical Supplies then package the treatments according the randomisation list generated. Concealment of allocation is maintained by a third party, since the sites phone in and are allocated treatments on that basis. Alternatively a third party may dispense the drug at the sites. Unblinding of data for interim analyses can only be done through RandAll, and are restricted so that only those reviewing the data are unblinded to treatment group allocation.</P>
