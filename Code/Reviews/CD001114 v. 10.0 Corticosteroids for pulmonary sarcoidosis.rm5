Both are randomised. I have included them in the update, but explained that data from them both are not usable for re-analysis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have amended the Methods of the Review section to reflect the shift in policy since this review was first published. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The statistics for the primary outome measure (CXR - oral steroids) need revisiting - I think that the effect size may not be as big as the previous version of this review may have otherwise indicated. The inclusion of a no treatment control arm with placebo controlled trial data was something of a mistake - although a wide and imprecise result was observed (N = small) the effect was well clear of the line, given what the other more adequately powered studies indicated. The absence of a placebo arm may have confounded the randomisation (it certainly did for the blinding!). I have left the data out for the update. Duration of treatment might explain some of the inconsistency (I2: 67.1%). The Fixed Effect model belies a more imprecise estimate which is confirmed with Random Effects modelling. This just scrapes significance (RR 1.01 to 2.09, P=0.05), so we should approach this finding with moderate caution. Also I am not sure whether the unchanged/deteriorated participants should be analysed separately - do we have a policy on improved/unchanged/deteriorated data? In the past I have been inclined to report unchanged/deteriorated as a way of establishing the positive effect of treatment. I have left them separate for now, but would be grateful for any input Chris might be able to give. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The long-term picture should also be clarified as we have large trials showing long-term effects now, which were not previously published. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Old title: #Corticosteroids for pulmonary sarcoidosis UPDATE (WITH CHRIS 280105)&lt;/p&gt;" NOTES_MODIFIED="2010-03-24 10:48:37 +0000" NOTES_MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson" REVIEW_NO="CCS-ILD" REVMAN_SUB_VERSION="5.0.23" REVMAN_VERSION="5" SPLIT_FROM="" STAGE="R" STATUS="A" TYPE="INTERVENTION" VERSION_NO="10.0">

<DESCRIPTION>
<P>Five new studies met the inclusion criteria for this update of the review (search results from May 2004). The trials assessed steroid efficacy in these ways:<BR/>
<BR/>du Bois 2003 and Milman 1994 assessed inhaled steroid versus placebo. Data from these studies could not be utilised as not all participants were steroid-naive at study entry.<BR/>
<BR/>Pietinalho 1999 contributed data on long-term follow-up. Data from this study had previously been included on short-term treatment effectiveness<BR/>
<BR/>Baughman 2002 assessed an inhaled steroid as oral steroid tapering agent. This small study did not add new data to the existing analyses. It did not provide definitive evidence on the effectiveness of inhaled steroid therapy in sarcoidosis.<BR/>
<BR/>McGrath 2002 assessed inhaled steroids versus placebo without an oral steroid tapering protocol. Although data could be pooled with one existing study the sample size for this comparison remains very small, and the effect estimate imprecise.<BR/>
<BR/>Roth 1975 assessed steroid therapy versus no treatment and assessed outcome at long-term follow-up. Study findings from this study should be interpreted with caution due to irregular participant assessment.<BR/>
<BR/>Overall the conclusions of the review were not altered by the inclusion of these studies. They did however, provide different insights in to the use of steroids in pulmonary sarcoidosis.</P>

<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Sarcoidosis is a common disease that can affect several parts of the body. The cause of the disease is unknown, and it often gets better without treatment. Sarcoidosis is more likely among some ethnic groups (including African-Americans and African-Caribbeans), for whom the disease has worse outcomes. When sarcoidosis affects the lungs, it can cause breathlessness, coughs, and lung problems, and lead to more complications and death. The review of trials found that using corticosteroids for lung sarcoidosis leads to some short-term benefit in terms of chest x-ray, but there is limited evidence that this benefit lasts or affects the long term outcomes of the disease.</P>

</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT MODIFIED="2010-03-24 10:47:29 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Pulmonary sarcoidosis is a common condition with an unpredictable course. Oral (OCS) or inhaled steroids (ICS) are widely used in its treatment, but there is no consensus about when and in whom therapy should be initiated, what dose should be given and for how long. Corticosteroids given for several months have deleterious side-effects so it is important to know whether they have any maintained benefit in pulmonary sarcoidosis.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To determine the randomised controlled trial (RCT) evidence for the benefit of corticosteroids (oral or inhaled) in the treatment of pulmonary sarcoidosis.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2010-03-24 10:47:29 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE were searched using predefined terms. Bibliographies of retrieved RCTs and reviews were searched for additional RCTs. Pharmaceutical companies and authors of identified RCTs were contacted for other published and unpublished studies. Searches are current as of May 2008.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Two reviewers independently assessed full text articles for inclusion based upon the following criteria: the study had to be a RCT or controlled clinical trial in adults with histological evidence of pulmonary sarcoidosis, treated with OCS (oral steroids) or ICS (oral steroids), compared with a control.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Study quality was assessed and data extracted independently by two reviewers. The primary outcome was CXR (chest x-ray). Outcomes were analysed as continuous and dichotomous outcomes, using standard statistical techniques. Heterogeneity was explored where it was identified.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Thirteen RCTs of variable quality involving 1066 participants met the inclusion criteria of the review. The oral steroid dose was equivalent to prednisolone 4-40 mg/day. OCS: there was an improvement in CXR over 3-24 months (Relative Risk (RR): 1.46 [1.01 to 2.09], 3 studies), but this finding requires cautious interpretation. No other significant differences were identified on secondary outcomes. ICS: Data were inadequate to perform meaningful analysis of data on CXR. Two studies showed no improvement in lung function, In one study there was an improvement in diffusing capacity in the treated group. There were no data on side-effects. In one study symptoms improved at the end of six months of treatment.<B>
<BR/>
</B>
</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>Oral steroids improved the chest X-ray and a global score of CXR, symptoms and spirometry over 3-24 months. However, there is little evidence of an improvement in lung function. There are limited data beyond two years to indicate whether oral steroids have any modifying effect on long-term disease progression. Oral steroids may be of benefit for patients with Stage 2 and 3 disease with moderate to severe or progressive symptoms or CXR changes. </P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>

<BODY MODIFIED="2008-12-04 09:20:10 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Sarcoidosis is a common, multi system granulomatous disorder. Lungs are frequently involved and can often progress to pulmonary fibrosis. This results in increased morbidity and mortality. Certain ethnic groups, including the Black American and Afro-Caribbean populations have a higher incidence of pulmonary sarcoidosis, which runs a particularly relentless course with higher morbidity and mortality. The severity of lung involvement is assessed on the basis of the patient's symptoms (particularly dyspnoea and cough), on changes on the chest x-ray (which are staged from 1-4) and on deteriorating lung function tests. </P>
<P>Spontaneous resolution can occur without treatment. Patients with evidence of worsening symptoms or lung function are treated with high doses of oral corticosteroids with the objective of preventing disease progression and to alleviate symptoms. Patients with extra pulmonary sarcoidosis, such as neurosarcoidosis, hypercalcaemia and uveitis are often treated with corticosteroids but they are not considered in this review. There is no consensus about when corticosteroid therapy should be initiated, what dose of corticosteroids should be given and for how long. Corticosteroids given in high doses for several months have deleterious side effects so it is important to know whether they have any beneficial effect in pulmonary sarcoidosis.</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>The objective of the review was to determine the evidence derived from RCTs for the efficacy of corticosteroids (oral or inhaled) in the treatment of patients with pulmonary sarcoidosis.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="6">Participants</HEADING>
<P>A total of 1066 participants were recruited in the studies. Median sample size was 45 (range: 15 to 280). All were adults with pulmonary sarcoidosis. The majority of participants in the studies were male Caucasians. The participants varied in terms of the duration of the disease. <LINK REF="STD-Baughman-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Baughman 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-du-Bois-2003" TYPE="STUDY">du Bois 2003</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Erkkila-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Erkkila 1988</LINK> recruited participants with newly detected sarcoidosis.

Due to the nature of sarcoidosis long-term outcome assessment is crucial in determining whether short-term treatment leads to benefit in the long-term. Follow-up was conducted in seven studies (<LINK REF="STD-Alberts-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Alberts 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Israel-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Israel 1973</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McGrath-2002" TYPE="STUDY">McGrath 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pietinalho-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Pietinalho 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Roth-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Roth 1975</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Selroos-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Selroos 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zaki-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Zaki 1987</LINK>).

<P>Although there was some variation between the Jadad scores, this tends to reflect differences in the quality of reporting rather than differences in terms of methodological quality.</P>

<P>Two studies which had been excluded previously because over concerns over the data and randomisation were deemed to have met the inclusion criteria (<LINK REF="STD-Roth-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Roth 1975</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Milman-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Milman 1994</LINK>).</P>
<P>Results from the meta-analyses are reported by comparisons and then outcome (CXR changes, symptoms and lung function) at the end of treatment with oral steroids or with inhaled steroids.

<P>Combining the three placebo-controlled studies resulted in moderate to high inconsistency between the studies (<LINK REF="STD-James-1967" TYPE="STUDY">James 1967</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pietinalho-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Pietinalho 1999</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Zaki-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Zaki 1987</LINK>; I<SUP>2</SUP>: 67.1%). Fixed Effect and Random Effects models resulted in a significant benefit in steroid-treated participants (RR (FE): 1.42 [95%CI: 1.20 to 1.69]; (RE) 1.46 [1.01 to 2.09]). The duration of treatment varies considerably between the studies (3 to 24 months) and may account for differences in response. The RE estimate is marginally clear the line of no difference and should be treated with caution, although this does not preclude the possibility of clinically meaningful benefit for short-term outcome. The proportion of patients in the steroid group who deteriorated was significantly lower than in the placebo group (RR 0.39 [95% CI: 0.18 to 0.87]).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Selroos-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Selroos 1979</LINK> reported changes in CXR at seven, 24 and 48 months of treatment. By seven months there was a statistically significant difference in favour of the treated versus the untreated groups in terms of the number of participants with normal or improved CXR (treated group: 17/19 versus untreated: 11/18, P&lt;0.05). By 24 and 48 months the difference is no longer significant (24 months: treated group: 12/19 versus untreated group: 10/13; 48 months: treated group: 11/13 versus untreated group: 9/12, no P values reported).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Israel-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Israel 1973</LINK> recorded CXR changes, lung function and symptoms in 83 patients.

<P>Seven of the eleven RCTs had follow-up data. These results could not be aggregated so are discussed individually.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Alberts-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Alberts 1995</LINK>, followed patients up for six months after treatment with inhaled steroids for six months. Forty seven patients were randomised for the study, 32 completed the study and only 30 were left six months after follow-up. Some withdrew from the study and 11 were treated with oral steroids during the treatment period or follow-up so were excluded. Analysis of the follow-up data was confined to patients remaining in the study at the end of the six months of therapy. No statistically significant difference between the treated and control groups was found at the end of follow-up, whether in terms of CXR or lung function. Patients treated with inhaled steroids had shown an improvement in symptoms at the end of treatment but there were no further changes at follow-up. Patients who remained in the study until the end had stable disease not requiring intervention with oral steroids, so bias due to a survivor effect was present.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Israel-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Israel 1973</LINK> followed up patients for 1-11 years (mean five years) after treatment with oral steroids for three months. Eighty three patients were randomised for the study and all completed it, but 38% of those given placebo and 24% given steroids required treatment with oral steroids during follow-up. In addition, eight patients needed chlorambucil because of deterioration. There was no difference between treated and control groups at follow up (mean 5.3 years) and no difference with the different radiographic stages of disease. Patients with pulmonary involvement at the onset had a worse outcome compared to those with hilar lymphadenopathy alone regardless of treatment.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Selroos-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Selroos 1979</LINK> followed up patients for up to 48 months after treatment with oral steroids for seven months. Thirty nine patients were randomised and thirty seven completed the treatment. Thirty two were assessed at 24 months and 25 at 48 months. Five patients were treated with steroids in the initial follow-up period and a further six were treated with steroids after 24 months because of deterioration. At the end of treatment there was a statistically significant difference between treated and control groups in FVC and DL<SUB>CO</SUB> but this difference did not persist at follow-up. Patients whose lung function had initially improved with treatment did not maintain this improvement. There was a significant improvement in the CXR in treated patients at the end of treatment but the differences were not statistically significant at follow-up.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Zaki-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Zaki 1987</LINK> followed up 70% of their patients for more than three years and 35% for more than four years after treatment with oral steroids for two years. One hundred and fifty nine patients were randomised and all completed the study but many were lost to follow-up for reasons that are not made clear. There were no significant differences between treated and control groups with regard to CXR, FVC, FEV<SUB>1</SUB> or DL<SUB>CO </SUB>at the end of treatment and there were no further changes at follow-up.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Pietinalho-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Pietinalho 1999</LINK> followed up 154 patients after treatment with either prednisolone or placebo for three months. These patients were then randomised to receive either inhaled budesonide or placebo inhaler therapy for a further fifteen months. Thirty five patients withdrew, sixteen in the treated group and nineteen in the placebo group. CXR, FVC and DL<SUB>CO</SUB> were measured during and at the end of follow-up. They conclude that treatment is not required for patients with stage 1 disease but that an initial treatment with prednisolone followed by budesonide is more effective than placebo in patients with stage 2 disease.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-McGrath-2002" TYPE="STUDY">McGrath 2002</LINK> assessed participants at three month follow-up post-treatment. The status of CXR was assessed between 6 and 9 months. It was reported that five/12 participants in the placebo-treated group and two/15 in the BDP-treated group had CXR's deemed 'improved'. No change was reported for five/12 placebo-treated participants and five/15 BDP-treated participants. Two/15 participants and eight/12 participants deemed to have CXRs which had deteriorated.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Roth-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Roth 1975</LINK> recruited 280 patients for treatment with oral steroids for six months or 12 months and compared them to a 'no treatment' control group. They followed the patients up for 5-14 years (mean eight years) with regular radiographic and spirometric assessments. Many patients were lost to follow-up and there was no information about patients who relapsed. Treatment was discontinued in patients who experienced side-effects. There was an improvement in the CXR at the end of the first two years but no difference at subsequent follow-up. There was also no difference in the spirometric measurements at follow-up.</P>
<P>In summary, only in one of these follow-up studies did a difference between the treated and control groups in terms of improvement in symptoms, CXR or lung function become apparent despite an extended period of follow-up.<BR/>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2008-12-02 11:46:43 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>Treatment of pulmonary sarcoidosis with oral steroids for 6-24 months resulted in more patients having an improvement in the CXR and fewer patients having a worse CXR than in patients who received placebo. The risk ratio for improvement in CXR with oral steroid treatment was increased on average by 46% (95% CI: 1% to 109%), although the dose of oral steroid varied between the studies. However, the longer -term effects are less clear. Sub-group analysis of data from one paper (<LINK REF="STD-Israel-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Israel 1973</LINK>) showed an improvement in global scores in patients with stage 2 and 3 disease, but not with stage 1 disease. In that study, patients in the control group showed a deterioration in CXR at the end of the treatment period compared to the treated group (<LINK REF="STD-Erkkila-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Erkkila 1988</LINK>)</P>
<P>Data concerning lung function were reported in different ways so it was not possible to aggregate them in a meta-analysis. Within the individual studies, there was no significant improvement in lung function in patients treated with oral steroids although one study (<LINK REF="STD-Selroos-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Selroos 1979</LINK>) showed an improvement in DLCO in the treated group. In that study, sub-group analysis showed no difference in the change in DLCO between the different radiographic stages of the disease.</P>
<P>Three studies were conducted in which patients were given oral corticosteroids followed by inhaled steroids (<LINK REF="STD-Baughman-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Baughman 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-du-Bois-2003" TYPE="STUDY">du Bois 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pietinalho-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Pietinalho 1999</LINK>). The studies were of medium and long-term duration, but did not detect significant improvement in any lung function measure, symptoms and the amount of oral steroids required. The Pietinalho study looked over a 18 month period to see whether early treatment influenced the long-term prognosis and showed that although there was no significant improvement in CXR or lung function at the end of treatment , the placebo treated patients required treatment with oral steroids more frequently in the five year follow-up period. However, nearly a third of patients were lost to follow up (in both treatment and placebo groups) in the 5 year period.</P>
<P>There is no evidence that inhaled steroids improved CXR or lung function, although in one study (<LINK REF="STD-Erkkila-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Erkkila 1988</LINK>) there was a small improvement in DLCO/Va. This parameter may be the most sensitive measure of lung function in sarcoidosis, but the numbers in this study were very small. Furthermore, no actual data were given, only the number of patients who had an increase in DL<SUB>CO</SUB>/Va greater than 15% above baseline values. In another study, there was an improvement in symptoms at the end of treatment with inhaled steroids for six months (<LINK REF="STD-Alberts-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Alberts 1995</LINK>). It is now accepted that pulmonary sarcoidosis has an endobronchial component, so inhaled steroids may improve symptoms, particularly cough, by its action at this site.</P>
<P>It is important to note that the majority of patients in the trials of inhaled steroids had stage 1 and 2 disease, and so were perhaps less likely to show a significant improvement.</P>
<P>
<B>Methodological Limitations</B>
<BR/>Trials that could be included in this review used different outcome measures and presented lung function data as dichotomous or continuous data. It was not possible to combine much of the trial data for meta-analysis so there was no gain in statistical power. Often, results of symptoms or CXR changes were described as "improved", but without numerical data. Sub-group analysis was confined to differences seen with the different stages of pulmonary sarcoidosis. No other sub-group analysis was possible because of the lack of data.</P>
<P>Thirteen RCTs were included in this review, of which seven had data at follow up, from six months to a mean of eight years after treatment. There were data on CXR changes, lung function and symptoms. None of these studies reported a consistent beneficial effect of oral or inhaled steroids. We were unable to use the follow-up data in our review for the following reasons:</P>
<OL>
<LI>The follow-up studies were uncontrolled with a lack of a common end point. It was not always clear when the tests were done or at what time point the data were collected.</LI>
<LI>It was not clear how many patients had been lost to follow-up or the reasons for this.</LI>
<LI>Patients who deteriorated after the treatment period, either from the treated or the control group, were given oral steroids or other treatment, then excluded from the study. The number of patients thus excluded from the final analysis was considerable which introduces a selection bias since it excludes those patients who were worse thus introducing a survivor effect.</LI>
<LI>There was no blinding in the follow-up period and the assessment of patients was not done in a controlled or systematic way.</LI>
</OL>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>These data provide only limited guidance to physicians in the treatment of chronic pulmonary sarcoidosis. The results fit with the currently held view that patients with stage 1 disease (bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy alone) do not need treatment with oral steroids, but that those with interstitial lung disease (stages 2 and 3) may show an improvement in CXR and in global scores when treated with oral steroids. There is little evidence that treatment with oral steroids has a beneficial effect on lung function.</P>
<P>The available data provides little guidance for the management of this disease after 2 years. There is limited evidence that oral steroids alter disease progression and early treatment alters progression of the disease. The trials did not report side effects or complications in any standard form and the lack of reliable estimates of efficacy or details of side-effects precludes any estimate of risk-benefit ratio. Physicians treating these patients need to bear these points in mind when making management decisions after two years of therapy. </P>
<P>There is little evidence for the efficacy of inhaled steroids. It is well recognized that sarcoidosis is also commonly an endobronchial disease and can cause a troublesome cough. Inhaled steroids should, in theory, be beneficial for this symptom, but this is yet to be established in randomised trials. Inhaled steroids may have less systemic side effects than oral steroids and could be considered for symptom relief in those presenting with a cough.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Pulmonary sarcoidosis is characterised by a course that is unpredictable, with some patients showing spontaneous resolution while others progress to chronic lung disease including lung fibrosis. It is not possible currently to identify those patients who are in the latter group. Identification of this group of patients at presentation would make it possible to see if treatment with steroids in this group prevents progression of the disease to lung fibrosis.</P>
<P>It is known that certain ethnic groups, mainly African Americans and Afro-Caribbeans have a higher incidence of pulmonary sarcoidosis, which runs a particularly relentless course with higher morbidity and mortality. Further studies in this group of patients may identify prognostic factors. Similarly, spontaneous resolution of the disease also occurs and it would be helpful to identify markers that distinguish patients who follow such a course.</P>
<P>There are only a small number of randomised controlled trials in the treatment of pulmonary sarcoidosis. Much useful information could be gained from a large, multi-centre, randomised controlled trial of the effect of oral and inhaled steroids. Such a trial will need to include large numbers of patients from the African and Afro-Caribbean ethnic groups, will have to last several years and include all stages of pulmonary disease. Outcome measures should include a well-validated symptom score, measurement of lung function, CXR and CT scans of the chest, if possible. These should be done at regular intervals. Patients who withdraw or dropout should be accounted for and followed up in the same way as those who continue. Progression to lung fibrosis must also be determined and the side effects of treatment with steroids must be well documented.</P>
