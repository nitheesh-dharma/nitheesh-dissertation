<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2013-01-25 12:32:40 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>Rehabilitation treatments may be effective in improving the physical health of older people in long-term care. In 2010, 7.6% of the world's population were over 65 years old, and this is predicted to increase to 13% by 2035. It is expected that this will lead to a rise in demand for long-term residential care. This has increased interest in ways to prevent deterioration in health and activities of daily living, for example, walking and dressing, among care home residents. Physical rehabilitation (interventions based on exercising the body) may have a role, and this review examines the evidence available. This review included 67 trials, 36 of which were conducted in North America, 20 in Europe, and seven in Asia. In total, 6300 participants with an average age of 83 years were involved. Most interventions in some way addressed difficulties in activities of daily living. This review investigates the effects of physical rehabilitation on activities of daily living, strength, flexibility, balance, mood, cognition (memory and thinking), exercise tolerance, fear of falling, death, illness, and unwanted effects associated with the intervention, such as injuries. While variations between trials meant that we could not make specific recommendations, individual studies were often successful in demonstrating benefits to physical health from participating in different types of physical rehabilitation.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2013-01-22 10:07:15 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>The worldwide population is progressively ageing, with an expected increase in morbidity and demand for long-term care. Physical rehabilitation is beneficial in older people, but relatively little is known about effects on long-term care residents. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2009.<BR/>

</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2013-01-15 19:53:40 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>To evaluate the benefits and harms of rehabilitation interventions directed at maintaining, or improving, physical function for older people in long-term care through the review of randomised and cluster randomised controlled trials.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2013-01-22 11:57:33 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>We searched the trials registers of the following Cochrane entities: the Stroke Group (May 2012), the Effective Practice and Organisation of Care Group (April 2012), and the Rehabilitation and Related Therapies Field (April 2012). In addition, we searched 20 relevant electronic databases, including the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (<I>The Cochrane Library,</I> 2009, Issue 4), MEDLINE (1966 to December 2009), EMBASE (1980 to December 2009), CINAHL (1982 to December 2009), AMED (1985 to December 2009), and PsycINFO (1967 to December 2009). We also searched trials and research registers and conference proceedings; checked reference lists; and contacted authors, researchers, and other relevant Cochrane entities. We updated our searches of electronic databases in 2011 and listed relevant studies as awaiting assessment.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2013-01-15 19:58:07 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>Randomised studies comparing a rehabilitation intervention designed to maintain or improve physical function with either no intervention or an alternative intervention in older people (over 60 years) who have permanent long-term care residency.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2013-01-22 10:07:57 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>Two review authors independently assessed risk of bias and extracted data. We contacted study authors for additional information. The primary outcome was function in activities of daily living. Secondary outcomes included exercise tolerance, strength, flexibility, balance, perceived health status, mood, cognitive status, fear of falling, and economic analyses. We investigated adverse effects, including death, morbidity, and other events. We synthesised estimates of the primary outcome with the mean difference; mortality data, with the risk ratio; and secondary outcomes, using vote-counting.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-01-25 14:03:19 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Tom Crocker">
<P>We included 67 trials, involving 6300 participants. Fifty-one trials reported the primary outcome, a measure of activities of daily living. The estimated effects of physical rehabilitation at the end of the intervention were an improvement in Barthel Index (0 to 100) scores of six points (95% confidence interval (CI) 2 to 11, P = 0.008, seven studies), Functional Independence Measure (0 to 126) scores of five points (95% CI -2 to 12, P = 0.1, four studies), Rivermead Mobility Index (0 to 15) scores of 0.7 points (95% CI 0.04 to 1.3, P = 0.04, three studies), Timed Up and Go test of five seconds (95% CI -9 to 0, P = 0.05, seven studies), and walking speed of 0.03 m/s (95% CI -0.01 to 0.07, P = 0.1, nine studies). Synthesis of secondary outcomes suggested there is a beneficial effect on strength, flexibility, and balance, and possibly on mood, although the size of any such effect is unknown. There was insufficient evidence of the effect on other secondary outcomes. Based on 25 studies (3721 participants), rehabilitation does not increase risk of mortality in this population (risk ratio 0.95, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.13). However, it is possible bias has resulted in overestimation of the positive effects of physical rehabilitation.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2013-01-22 10:08:16 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>Physical rehabilitation for long-term care residents may be effective, reducing disability with few adverse events, but effects appear quite small and may not be applicable to all residents. There is insufficient evidence to reach conclusions about improvement sustainability, cost-effectiveness, or which interventions are most appropriate. Future large-scale trials are justified.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Physical function in older people in long-term care</HEADING>
<P>Elder residents of long-term care are amongst the frailest in our population, with significant healthcare and social care needs (<LINK REF="REF-Bowman-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bowman 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Continuing-Care-Conference-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Continuing Care Conference 2006</LINK>). Increasing age is associated with increasing disability. In developed countries, long-term care for older people is often provided in institutional settings for those with physical or mental conditions that preclude independent living (<LINK REF="REF-Continuing-Care-Conference-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Continuing Care Conference 2006</LINK>). It is reported that care-home residents spend the majority of their time inactive, with low levels of interaction with staff (<LINK REF="REF-Holthe-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Holthe 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sackley-2006a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sackley 2006a</LINK>).</P>
<P>Decreasing mobility and increasing dependency have many adverse effects. For residents in care homes, it may lead to increased incidence of pressure sores, contractures, cardiovascular deconditioning, urinary infections, and loss of independence (<LINK REF="REF-Butler-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Butler 1998</LINK>). Sedentary behaviour is adversely associated with chronic disease risk factors and all-cause mortality (<LINK REF="REF-Balboa_x002d_Castillo-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Balboa-Castillo 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-DH-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">DH 2011</LINK>). Mobility problems and reduced physical activity compound health difficulties by directly affecting physical and psychological health and reducing opportunities to participate in social activities; social isolation negatively impacts on mood and self-esteem, which can then further adversely affect physical health (<LINK REF="REF-Marmot-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marmot 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NICE-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2008</LINK>). Residents identify mobility as of central importance to quality of life and well-being (<LINK REF="REF-Bourret-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bourret 2002</LINK>), and residents with dementia wish for more day-time activities (<LINK REF="REF-Hancock-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hancock 2006</LINK>). Physical ill-health and disability are the most consistent risk factors for depression in later life, with reports suggesting that, rather than illness per se, it is the resulting functional limitations, including social participation and meaningful relationships, that increase the risk of depression (<LINK REF="REF-Braam-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Braam 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zeiss-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zeiss 1996</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="2">Physical rehabilitation</HEADING>
<P>Physical rehabilitation is defined as those interventions that aim to maintain or improve physical function of an individual. In a care-home setting, this typically involves increasing the physical exertions of an individual (active), although passive rehabilitation involving external stimulation (e.g. whole body vibration) is also in use. The focus of this review is active rehabilitation, which may be in the form of specific exercises or physical activity as a part of some other purposeful or leisure activity. It may be provided in a group format or individually; generic or tailored; and delivered by rehabilitation professionals (e.g. physiotherapist), care staff, or self-directed.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2013-01-22 10:09:20 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Physical activity provides positive benefits for people over 65 years old for a range of outcomes: mood (<LINK REF="REF-Blake-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blake 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Windle-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Windle 2010</LINK>), decreased disease risk, and overall health (<LINK REF="REF-DH-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">DH 2011</LINK>). For frail institutionalised older people, systematic reviews indicate that physical training can positively affect fitness for some participants (<LINK REF="REF-Chin-A-Paw-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chin A Paw 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rydwik-2004a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rydwik 2004a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Weening_x002d_Dijksterhuis-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weening-Dijksterhuis 2011</LINK>); the level of effect may be related to level of frailty (<LINK REF="REF-Chin-A-Paw-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chin A Paw 2008</LINK>). A recent review of the effects of physical activity for older people with dementia (not all of whom were in institutions) reports some benefits to walking, getting out of chairs, lower limb strength, and flexibility (<LINK REF="REF-Potter-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Potter 2011</LINK>). Included studies in the reviews were generally small and of variable quality.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2013-01-25 14:06:13 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Dramatic increases in life expectancy over the last century are likely to result in a significant increase in the demand for long-term care. Between 1985 and 2010 the proportion of the world's population over 65 years old grew by a quarter, from 6.0% (291 million) to 7.6% (524 million), and is expected to increase to 13% by 2035, exceeding a billion people globally (<LINK REF="REF-United-Nations-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">United Nations 2011</LINK>). However, this prospect of longevity may be associated with a concomitant increase in morbidity and requirement for long-term care in a residential setting. Annual healthcare costs among those living in long-term care (USD 45,400 per annum) are over four times greater than the average for the elderly population in the USA in 1998 (<LINK REF="REF-Lubitz-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lubitz 2003</LINK>). This means that despite much shorter life expectancy, total costs of care for those institutionalised at 70 are much greater than for the rest of the population (<LINK REF="REF-Lubitz-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lubitz 2003</LINK>). Of those aged 65 or over, in the USA in 2004, 1.3 million (3.6%) were living in nursing homes (<LINK REF="REF-Jones-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jones 2009</LINK>), while in England and Wales in 2001, 310,000 (3.7%) were living in care homes (<LINK REF="REF-ONS-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">ONS 2003</LINK>). Projections of the use of long-term care are unreliable (<LINK REF="REF-US-Department-of-Health-and-Human-Services-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">US Department of Health and Human Services 2003</LINK>) as they rely on a variety of factors other than population projections, including finances; changes in the prevalence of disability; and social, technical, and organisational changes to the provision of assistance with independent living, including informal care. However, even if usage rates reduced by a third, approximately 2 million people would require nursing-home care in the USA by 2030, a significant increase on current amounts (<LINK REF="REF-Sahyoun-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sahyoun 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>An encouraging evidence base is being developed about rehabilitation programmes appropriate to the circumstances and needs of older people. In addition, governing bodies world wide are responding to the pressures exerted by current demographic patterns by placing increased emphasis on promoting health and independence in old age, which may result in greater investment in rehabilitation services. This review examines the evidence for the effectiveness of physical rehabilitation for older people in long-term care. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2009; it includes an additional 18 studies and now formally quantifies some of the pooled results using meta-analytical methods.</P>

<P>Physical rehabilitation was defined as those interventions that aim to maintain or improve physical function. We included studies that compared a rehabilitation intervention designed to maintain or improve physical function with either no intervention or an alternative intervention. We excluded interventions that primarily addressed cognitive deficits, mood disorders, or both, unless they also aimed to improve the physical state. We evaluated interventions by content, not by the personnel implementing them (e.g. physiotherapist, occupational therapist). We excluded studies where the intervention and control groups received the same physical rehabilitation intervention with the only differential being a non-rehabilitative component. We reported comparisons of physical rehabilitation versus control (no physical rehabilitation, but including other interventions such as social visits) and comparisons of physical rehabilitation (experimental) versus physical rehabilitation (control), where the experimental intervention is hypothesised by the study authors to be more rehabilitative than the control. During the review process, the review team reached consensus to exclude those trials in which physical exercise was a component of a multifaceted intervention primarily aimed at falls prevention as this topic is addressed in other Cochrane reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Cameron-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cameron 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gillespie-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gillespie 2003</LINK>).</P>

<P>Two review authors independently assessed risk of bias in included studies using The Cochrane Collaboration's tool for assessing risk of bias (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). We assessed risk in the categories of sequence generation (was assignment truly random?), allocation concealment (could group assignment be foreseen and therefore subverted?), blinding of participants and personnel (could participants and care staff identify treatment allocation?), blinding of outcome assessment (could outcome assessors identify treatment allocation?), incomplete outcome data (could attrition or exclusions have resulted in bias?), selective reporting (did authors report all prespecified outcomes) and any other risks of bias, using the criteria provided (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). We assessed the blinding of outcome assessment separately for observed measures of function in ADL (such as the TUG test) and reported measures of function in ADL (such as the BI) as these were entered into meta-analyses and were likely to have involved different assessors and involved different difficulties with blinding. We assessed each category as having low, high, or unclear risk of bias. We resolved any disagreements by discussion and contacted study authors for clarification if appropriate. We did not actively seek pre-study protocols unless they were referenced within a report or had been identified through our literature searches.</P>

<EFFECT_MEASURES MODIFIED="2012-11-20 16:11:54 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Tom Crocker">
<P>We treated ordinal data as if they were continuous. For continuous data, we combined the estimates for each study using the mean difference (MD). For dichotomous data, we combined the estimates for each study using the risk ratio (RR).</P>
</EFFECT_MEASURES>
<UNIT_OF_ANALYSIS MODIFIED="2013-01-28 16:45:56 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Tom Crocker">
<P>In cross-over trials, we only included data from the first period of the trial in meta-analyses to guard against carry-over effects. Where a trial comprised of more than one exercise group (e.g. <LINK REF="STD-Christofoletti-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Christofoletti 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MacRitchie-2001" TYPE="STUDY">MacRitchie 2001</LINK>), we used the group with the greatest rehabilitative component to compare with the group with the least intervention.</P>
<P>Where cluster randomised studies presented an estimate of effect that properly accounted for the cluster design, this was used. Where this was not the case, we assumed that the intra-cluster correlation coefficient (ICC) was the same as for other studies included in the review for that outcome. We calculated an average ICC for the outcome and corrected the values for each unadjusted study by the design effect (see <LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). Where the ICC for an outcome was not available from the other included studies we attempted to find an appropriate estimate from external databases (e.g. <LINK REF="REF-Elley-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elley 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Health-Services-Research-Unit-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Health Services Research Unit 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ukoumunne-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ukoumunne 1999</LINK>). Where no appropriate estimate was available, we presented unadjusted estimates. In all cases, we presented sensitivity analyses excluding cluster studies.</P>
</UNIT_OF_ANALYSIS>
<MISSING_DATA MODIFIED="2013-01-22 10:54:36 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Tom Crocker">
<P>Because of the long-term nature of the interventions and the frailty of the population, we anticipated a high rate of loss to follow up because of death, deviating from the intention-to-treat (ITT) principle. Where multiple analyses were reported, we used the data that most closely resembled an available case analysis (i.e. all available data are analysed in the intervention groups to which participants were assigned, without imputation of missing data), but we did not exclude studies that had only performed other analyses. However, as described above, we assessed incomplete outcome data as a risk of bias and, as described below, we stratified studies by risk of bias; therefore, we accounted for large deviations from the ITT principle in the analysis. We used the generic inverse-variance approach to facilitate inclusion of studies presenting results in different ways, so we converted standard deviations, confidence intervals, or both, for each group separately to standard errors for the difference in means. Where data were missing, we made every effort to derive the appropriate measure from the available data. For example, we derived data from graphs and converted a variety of measures of time taken to cover set distances and walking speeds to metres per second.</P>

</BIAS_ASSESSMENT>
<DATA_SYNTHESIS MODIFIED="2013-01-25 12:03:58 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Tom Crocker">
<P>The included studies were heterogeneous. They examined different types of intervention and evaluated them with a wide battery of outcome measures. Such variety limited the feasibility of conducting meta-analyses. We chose to perform meta-analyses of measures of ADL, our primary outcome, and mortality.</P>
<P>Where we performed meta-analyses, for all outcomes, we presented random-effects meta-analyses because of the anticipated large heterogeneity caused by different populations and interventions involved in the trials. When results were presented at several time points, we used the time closest to the end of intervention unless a better analysis was available at another time point. For continuous or ordinal data, where results were presented in terms of change from baseline or adjusted for baseline, this was used in preference. We used a generic inverse-variance approach for continuous and ordinal data. We used the Mantel-Haenszel approach for dichotomous outcome data.</P>
<P>We originally intended to combine results in a fixed-effect meta-analysis where sufficient homogeneity existed. However, because of the extensive heterogeneity in the interventions, we used a random-effects meta-analysis as our primary approach, but still report the results of fixed-effect models as sensitivity analyses.</P>
<P>There were many different ways of measuring various ADL, so to reduce heterogeneity in the meta-analysis we focused on studies reporting the BI, FIM, Rivermead Mobility Index (RMI), TUG test, and certain measures of walking speed. For walking speeds and timed walks over a fixed distance, we converted the time to walk a fixed distance into speed (m/s) over that distance, to include as many similar studies as possible. However, we decided a priori to only include distances of less than 10 metres, to reduce heterogeneity introduced by very different designs. Of the remaining studies, there were an insufficient number assessing the same outcome to include in further meta-analyses. Those that appeared to assess similar outcomes were often measured in entirely different ways, assessing very different activities requiring varying functional ability. We therefore chose not to attempt to combine these quantitatively, even using standardised mean difference, because they were not actually assessing the same outcome.</P>
<P>For outcomes where a narrative synthesis is provided, we summarised those studies that reported a statistically significant difference in a direction that favoured the intervention or the control (P &lt; 0.05) and those that do not. We described limitations of such comparisons where statistical significance was reached (for example, a within-group comparison only). We provided a narrative exploration of the extent to which included studies demonstrated that their rehabilitative interventions were of benefit to the participants, and we discussed the nature and sustainability of any benefits. Some trials selected extremely frail individuals, and we considered this when assessing these interventions, as preventing or slowing decline may be the treatment goal in this situation.</P>
</DATA_SYNTHESIS>
<SUBGROUP_ANALYSIS MODIFIED="2013-01-22 10:23:07 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Tom Crocker">
<P>For all outcome measures, potential sources of heterogeneity decided a priori were risk of bias (see <LINK TAG="STUDY_QUALITY" TYPE="SECTION">Risk of bias in included studies</LINK>); duration of intervention: for the BI, FIM, death and walking speed less than three months compared with three or more months, and for the TUG test and RMI less than six months compared with six or more months; mode of delivery (group, individual or group and individual); mean age of participants (less than 85 years compared with 85 years or more); and the percentage of participants in the study who are female (less than 80% compared with 80% or more). For ADL outcome measures, we also specified the level of function at baseline as measured by the relevant outcome measure (above or below the median function). For walking speed, we also included the fixed distance walked (less than six metres compared with six metres or more), in case this was a source of heterogeneity. We investigated these through subgroup analysis.</P>
<P>Our original intention, if sufficient data existed, was to conduct analyses on the basis of methodological quality and the effect of dropouts, but this was replaced by risk of bias. We also specified age, pathology-specific interventions, mode of delivery, and residential category. However, we neither conducted analyses based on pathology-specific interventions, because insufficient data exists, nor conducted analyses based on residential category, because we replaced this with measured function at baseline (see <LINK TAG="PRO_REV_DIFF" TYPE="SECTION">Differences between protocol and review</LINK>).</P>
<P>We wanted to consider type of intervention as a potential source of heterogeneity, e.g. physiotherapy, strength training, mobility training, balance training, occupational therapy, but the interventions were often complex, containing many combinations of the above, and with great variation within each broad type. Given the small number of studies available for each meta-analysis, there were insufficient studies of each type to explore this interesting aspect further.</P>

In three of these, the outcome measures were measures of performance during single-session interventions, such as number of repetitions (<LINK REF="STD-DeKuiper-1993" TYPE="STUDY">DeKuiper 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lang-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Lang 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Riccio-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Riccio 1990</LINK>), while in two they followed long-term interventions that risked carry-over of treatment effects between periods (<LINK REF="STD-Ouslander-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ouslander 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pomeroy-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Pomeroy 1993</LINK>). Four trials also used a semi-cross-over design (<LINK REF="STD-Baum-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Baum 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Brown-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Brown 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kinion-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Kinion 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sauvage-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Sauvage 1992</LINK>) where participants allocated to the control group also received the intervention. However, in <LINK REF="STD-Sauvage-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Sauvage 1992</LINK> this was a post-hoc design following attrition from the intervention group.</P>
<P>Of the cluster trials, six (<LINK REF="STD-Brittle-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Brittle 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kerse-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Kerse 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Peri-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Peri 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Resnick-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Resnick 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sackley-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Sackley 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sackley-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Sackley 2009</LINK>) explicitly reported statistical analyses that were adjusted for the effect of clustering.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Eligibility criteria</HEADING>
<P>All of the studies except <LINK REF="STD-Przybylski-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Przybylski 1996</LINK> stated some eligibility criteria, which on average limited eligibility to half of all residents. This often related to the safety and feasibility of including such participants in the planned intervention or the likelihood of it showing an effect, and in 27 studies, it limited the focus to populations with specific functional limitations.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">General eligibility criteria</HEADING>
<P>Thirty studies had a minimum age limit (typically 65 years). Thirteen studies excluded participants that were engaged in physical therapy or activity. Six studies required participants to have been a resident for a minimum time that varied between one and four months; seven studies specified an expected duration of stay for at least as long as the intervention. Six studies excluded those with challenging behaviours, including abusive and aggressive behaviour.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Physical functioning or disorders</HEADING>
<P>Overall, 45 studies excluded residents with insufficient physical function or physical disorders. The ability to walk or be mobile was a requirement of 22 studies, of which two disallowed the use of walking aids; one allowed one carer to assist; five specified at least six metres and two at least five metres; one, 250 feet; and one, five minutes. Alternative requirements included the ability to independently stand (three studies), stand or transfer with assistance (five studies), or to be independent in all but one basic activity of daily living (ADL) (one study). Thirteen studies excluded participants on the basis of musculoskeletal disorders or other physical impairments, including paralysis and amputation.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Cognitive functioning and communication</HEADING>
<P>In total, 39 studies only included participants with a minimum level of cognitive function, often citing the ability to follow simple instructions; an additional four studies excluded participants because of communication-specific difficulties. Exclusion criteria were often stated as severe dementia or severe cognitive impairment, but where specific measures were given, these varied widely. Nine studies excluded participants on the basis of their Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score: Five required a minimum score between 20 and 23, indicating participants were cognitively intact or had mild dementia; one excluded those scoring less than 50% (typically 15); and three excluded those scoring less than 10 or 11, indicating severe dementia. Four studies excluded those with very low communication and physical skills using the Parachek Geriatric Rating Scale.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Other health conditions</HEADING>
<P>A variety of other health-related criteria were reasons for exclusion. Sixteen studies ruled out participants on the broad grounds of medical contraindications or at the discretion of a physician. Twenty-two studies excluded individuals with acute or unstable conditions, while 19 studies excluded those with a terminal condition or short life expectancy. Eight studies excluded individuals on the basis of recent medical events, for example, a fracture within the past six months. Twenty-seven studies identified a variety of specific diseases as reasons for exclusion, often including cardiac disorders (14 studies). Medical implants, including pacemakers and hip replacements, or specific medications were exclusion criteria in six studies. Seven studies excluded those with significant visual impairments. Four studies excluded individuals with psychological or psychiatric disorders.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Focus on specific conditions</HEADING>
<P>While most studies required participants to have some minimum level of physical or mental functioning, 27 studies only examined participants with some form of impairment or limitation.

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Representativeness of participants</HEADING>
<P>Approximately half of the population of participating facilities were eligible for entry into the trials, but only one quarter participated. Twenty-two studies reported the total population of the participating facilities, and the number of those who were eligible for participation. Across these, the total population included 14,384 (median = 423) individuals, 6853 (47.6%, median = 204) were eligible, but only 3426 (23.8%, median = 104) of whom were allocated to groups in the trials; 1618 (11.2%, median = 63) did not consent to participate, and in 14 trials, residents were excluded for other reasons, including insufficient capacity within the trial or individuals becoming unavailable (e.g. illness) before the trial began (total = 1849 (12.9%), median = 7).</P>

One study (<LINK REF="STD-Sauvage-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Sauvage 1992</LINK>) was especially problematic, reporting data from just 10 individuals. Starting with 12 participants, they allocated 6 each to the intervention and control groups. On losing two intervention participants, they allowed four control participants to complete the intervention. Therefore, they reported data for eight intervention participants and six control participants. Sample size calculations were performed for 17 studies (25%), although recruitment did not always achieve the target.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Interventions</HEADING>
<P>To provide a convenient overview, we categorised interventions according to key components. We describe individual programmes in the '<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>' tables. Details of the groups that experimental interventions were compared with in all studies are provided in the below 'Comparison conditions' section.</P>
<P>While most studies featured only one experimental intervention, two studies featured two different experimental physical interventions. <LINK REF="STD-Faber-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Faber 2006</LINK> compared 'functional walking' and 'in-balance' exercise interventions, while <LINK REF="STD-Morris-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Morris 1999</LINK> compared the 'fit for your life' exercise regime and the 'self-care for seniors' nursing rehabilitation programme. Therefore, 69 interventions are described across the 67 studies.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Physical components</HEADING>
<P>The most common physical components were strength training and walking. Forty-nine interventions included exercises targeted at basic components of physical fitness, such as strength or flexibility (rote exercise), while 40 interventions included practice of basic ADLs, such as walking or transfers, and 21 interventions featured other recreation or leisure activities, such as ball games or dancing.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Rote exercise</HEADING>
<P>Strength training, for example, using elastic resistance bands or weights, featured in 42 interventions. Balance (motor skill) exercises, such as tandem stands, were features of 21 interventions; flexibility (range of motion) exercises featured in 17 interventions; and endurance training featured in seven. Other less common features include relaxation and breathing exercises (three interventions) and posture training (two interventions).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Basic ADL practice</HEADING>
<P>Mobility training (walking or wheeling) featured in 37 interventions; transfer practice featured in 21 interventions; and 10 interventions included practice of other basic ADLs, such as washing, dressing, eating, or grooming.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Recreation and leisure-like activities</HEADING>
<P>Other recreation or leisure-like physical activities included kicking or throwing and catching balls, balloons or bean bags (10 interventions), rhythmic movement to music or dancing (5 interventions), Tai Chi (4 interventions), arts and crafts activities (1 intervention), meal preparation activities (2 interventions), and indoor gardening (1 intervention).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Combinations of physical components</HEADING>
<P>Seventeen interventions only featured rote exercises; thirteen, basic ADL practice; and five, recreational activities.

Imagery (e.g. pretending to pick apples) or 'added purpose' exercise (e.g. rotary arm exercise in the form of making biscuits) were compared with rote exercise. Two studies explored 'Whole body vibration', where exercises are performed on an oscillating platform (<LINK REF="STD-Bautmans-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Bautmans 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bruyere-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Bruyere 2005</LINK>).

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Format of intervention</HEADING>
<P>Interventions were most often delivered as supervised 45-minute group sessions three times weekly. Forty-one interventions included a group component, two of which were provided in pairs and three of which also had an individually delivered component. Another 18 individual interventions were described, with 10 not specifying whether they were provided on a group or individual basis. Despite the predominance of group-based interventions, some degree of tailoring to the ability or needs of the participant was a feature of 43 interventions. In 11 trials, participants carried out the intervention seated (e.g. <LINK REF="STD-McMurdo-1993" TYPE="STUDY">McMurdo 1993</LINK>), and in five further studies, this was optional (e.g. <LINK REF="STD-Karl-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Karl 1982</LINK>). Sessions were time-limited in 47 interventions, ranging from nine minutes to two and a half hours, with a median and mode of 45 minutes (10 studies). In most cases, sessions occurred on a routine basis, varying from weekly to four times daily, but most often three times weekly (median and mode, N = 30). In other cases, the intervention was continuous in nature or only administered once where the exercise rate or duration, rather than the effect of exercise on health were being evaluated. In the 32 interventions for which a total time per week could be calculated, this varied widely from 20 to 750 minutes per week, with a median of 120 minutes per week.</P>

<P>Three studies evaluated FIT (<LINK REF="STD-Alessi--1999" TYPE="STUDY">Alessi 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ouslander-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ouslander 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schnelle-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Schnelle 1995</LINK>). Here, exercises targeting specific individual needs, such as standing up, were provided throughout the day, incidental to daily nursing care routines, such as toileting. The therapeutic recreation nursing team intervention (<LINK REF="STD-Buettner--1997" TYPE="STUDY">Buettner 1997</LINK>) is comparable to these. Here, the nursing-home environment was enhanced, with every aspect of daily life regarded as part of the intervention. A range of activities were provided, including cardiovascular exercise, cooking, gardening, cognitive therapy, and sensory stimulation activities. Nursing staff were involved in provision, and ADLs such as dressing were targeted. <LINK REF="STD-Kerse-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Kerse 2008</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Peri-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Peri 2008</LINK> evaluated variations of a 'Promoting Independence' plan, where a functional physical goal was set with the resident, an activity plan based on ADLs was devised, and a healthcare assistant encouraged the resident to perform these.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Delivery of intervention</HEADING>
<P>It appeared that all interventions involved supervised delivery, as opposed to wholly self-directed interventions with a worksheet or video, for example. The majority were delivered by staff external to the home (54 interventions), using rehabilitation professionals (e.g. physiotherapists, occupational therapists, sports scientists, activities staff; 30 interventions), researchers (22 interventions), or a combination of these (2 interventions). Care facility staff delivered five interventions (<LINK REF="STD-Kinion-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Kinion 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lazowski-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Lazowski 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MacRitchie-2001" TYPE="STUDY">MacRitchie 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Morris-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Morris 1999</LINK> (both interventions)). All of these included the healthcare staff, while two included activities staff, and two included other staff (e.g. domestic staff). In two of these studies, volunteers (e.g. family members) participated in the delivery. Ten interventions involved both internal and external staff (<LINK REF="STD-Baum-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Baum 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Buettner--1997" TYPE="STUDY">Buettner 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kerse-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Kerse 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lee-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Lee 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Makita-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Makita 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Peri-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Peri 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Przybylski-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Przybylski 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Resnick-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Resnick 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rosendahl-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Rosendahl 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sackley-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Sackley 2009</LINK>): In six, staff were external rehabilitation professionals and internal healthcare staff; in three, internal and external healthcare staff; and in one, internal and external rehabilitation professionals.</P>
<P>Among the 10 interventions that were incidental to the resident's care (see the above 'Format of intervention' section), research staff provided the care and rehabilitation in five interventions (<LINK REF="STD-Alessi--1999" TYPE="STUDY">Alessi 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ouslander-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ouslander 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schnelle-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Schnelle 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schnelle-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Schnelle 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tappen-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Tappen 2000</LINK>); in four delivery was provided by a combination of internal and external staff (<LINK REF="STD-Buettner--1997" TYPE="STUDY">Buettner 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kerse-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Kerse 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Peri-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Peri 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Resnick-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Resnick 2009</LINK>), and in one delivery was provided wholly by internal staff (<LINK REF="STD-Morris-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Morris 1999</LINK> (self care for seniors)).</P>

Most typically, interventions were twelve weeks in duration (median and mode, N = 12), with 10 interventions lasting eight to nine weeks and 7 lasting six months. Total exposure to the intervention (total time per week multiplied by the duration of the intervention) ranged very widely from 240 minutes (four hours) (<LINK REF="STD-Karl-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Karl 1982</LINK>) to 15,653 minutes (approximately one and a half weeks delivered in two-hour sessions, five times per week for six months) (<LINK REF="STD-Christofoletti-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Christofoletti 2008</LINK>), with a median of 1440 minutes (24 hours) in the 32 interventions where this could be calculated.</P>

<P>Thirty-five studies compared their intervention(s) to a 'usual care' control group, allowing examination of whether an intervention was better or worse than their usual situation. The remaining studies supplemented 'usual care' in some way, for example, with a social meeting or different exercise. A social or recreational activity control session, for example, talking, playing cards, or reminiscing, featured in 18 studies (e.g. <LINK REF="STD-Baum-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Baum 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Brown-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Brown 2004</LINK>).

Four studies compared four groups. Two studies crossed an exercise and a social activity control with a nutritional supplement and a placebo control to examine whether exercise alone was better than the social activity control, and whether benefit from exercise was enhanced by nutritional supplementation (<LINK REF="STD-Fiatarone-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Fiatarone 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rosendahl-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Rosendahl 2006</LINK>). For the purposes of this review, we ignored the impact of supplementation, and where possible, we combined nutrition and placebo variants of exercise and control groups for meta-analyses. One study compared two different exercise programmes, each with their own control group (<LINK REF="STD-Faber-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Faber 2006</LINK>: controls were located in the same facilities as the relevant exercise programme). Finally, one study compared the effects of strength training and functional skills training, with the effect of both interventions combined and with an educational control group (<LINK REF="STD-Chin-A-Paw-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Chin A Paw 2004</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Outcome measures</HEADING>
<P>As a consequence of the considerable variation in the purpose and content of the interventions outlined above, the studies used many outcome measures (327 in total). Frequently, these were study-specific, with 59 studies including a unique measure and 258 of the 327 measures used being unique. The studies reported only 13 measures five or more times (Timed Up and Go (TUG) test, six-metre walk time, BI, Berg Balance Scale, Tinetti Mobility Scale, 'sit-and-reach' test, average number of sit-to-stands in 30 seconds, hand grip strength, Geriatric Depression Scale, MMSE, falls (number of falls and any per participant), and attendance). In total, 51 trials reported an outcome measure related to ADL, our primary outcome. Other common outcomes addressed by the studies included balance (29 studies), muscle power (25 studies), flexibility (16 studies), exercise tolerance (7 studies), physical activity (7 studies), mood (15 studies), cognitive performance (11 studies), quality of life (7 studies), fear of falling (6 studies), and perceived health status (6 studies). The studies also recorded morbidity, mortality, adverse events, and attendance.

We excluded these studies because the purpose was not to improve residents' physical condition (N = 14); assignment to groups was not random (N = 12); participants included those who were not residents of long-term care, and they did not report the results separately (N = 10); they evaluated a multi-faceted falls prevention intervention (N = 7); the aspect of the intervention that varied between groups was not physical rehabilitation (N = 4); they targeted contractures (N = 3); or there was insufficient information to include them (N = 2).</P>

<P>We included an additional 18 studies in this update. Half of the new studies have used a cluster-randomised design, previously only used by 20% of the included studies. Similarly, eight new studies had over 100 participants compared to 10 of the 49 studies in the previous version of the review. In total, the number of participants has almost doubled from 3611 to 6300. It was notable that only one new study came from North America, which had previously supplied 35 studies (71%) and that nine additional countries are represented in this review, including the first South American country (Brazil).</P>

<P>We present our 'Risk of bias' judgements, made according to The Cochrane Collaboration's tool, in the '<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>' tables and summarise them here in the text, in <LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>, and in <LINK REF="APP-07" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 7</LINK>. We did not judge any studies to have low risk of bias across all categories, with no studies judged to have a low risk of performance bias or reporting bias. To enable an analysis of the best available evidence, we selected the seven studies judged to have low risk of bias in all other categories (selection, detection, attrition, and other sources of bias) as a subgroup named 'lower risk of bias' for meta-analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Brittle-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Brittle 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chin-A-Paw-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Chin A Paw 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kerse-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Kerse 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McMurdo-1994" TYPE="STUDY">McMurdo 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sackley-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Sackley 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sackley-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Sackley 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sackley-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Sackley 2009</LINK>) to be contrasted with all other studies (higher risk of bias).</P>
<P>Several studies caused particular concern. <LINK REF="STD-Karl-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Karl 1982</LINK> did not report baseline or follow-up data or randomisation procedure. <LINK REF="STD-Brill-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Brill 1998</LINK> had only one room and time slot to conduct their weight-training intervention, which meant both groups received their intervention at the same time. It is unclear how far this deviates from the intended design. In <LINK REF="STD-Sauvage-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Sauvage 1992</LINK>, the study began with 12 individuals, and following the loss of two of the six intervention participants, crossed over four participants from the control group, whose results were reported in each group. They did not account for this in their statistical analysis (samples were treated as independent), nor did they discuss temporal differences or report results separately. The design used in one study (<LINK REF="STD-Przybylski-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Przybylski 1996</LINK>) also raised potential problems. Their intervention was implemented over two years, with 29 new participants recruited throughout to replace those who died or were discharged. The researchers had no control over who entered and left the groups and made the assumption that this was a random process.</P>

<P>We judged the risk of selection bias to be unclear in the majority of studies because they reported insufficient information. We judged the risk in both categories to be low for 13 studies and high for 2 studies, where after the initial randomisation, these studies allocated further participants without stating that this was performed randomly. We judged risk of bias due to random sequence generation to be low for 32 studies, unclear for 33 studies, and high for 2 studies. We judged concealment of the allocation sequence to pose low risk of bias for 16 studies and high risk of bias for 4 studies; it was unclear for 47 studies.</P>

<P>We did not judge blinding to pose low risk of bias in any of the studies, because none of them were able to achieve low risk with respect to blinding of participants and personnel (performance bias). We judged 47 studies to be at high risk of performance bias, usually because the control would have been obvious, while for 20 studies the risk of performance bias was judged unclear, typically where such blinding was feasible, using strategies including cluster randomisation and alternative interventions for the control groups, but not specifically reported. By contrast, blinding of outcomes assessors was often sufficient to judge a low risk of detection bias for the outcome measures entered into meta-analyses (for observed outcomes, 20 studies were at low risk, 16 studies were at unclear risk, and four studies were at high risk; for reported outcomes, 16 studies were at low risk, 9 studies were at unclear risk, and 3 studies were at high risk). Thirty-five of the 67 studies attempted blinding of some of their outcome assessments.</P>

<P>We judged incomplete outcome data to pose low risk of bias in 26 studies, high risk of bias in 21 studies, and it was unclear in 20 studies. Typically, high risk of bias related to differential attrition rates between study groups, but also high overall attrition, inability to get measurements for a significant proportion of participants, or post-randomisation exclusions. Overall attrition rates were reported by 59 of the 67 studies, among which the grand mean rate was 21.4% (N = 1300 of 6083).

<P>The Barthel Index (BI) assesses independence in physical ADL across 10 items, rated in increments of 5, e.g. scores of 0, 5, 10, with a maximum total score of 100 (best function). Some studies scaled this to increments of 1, e.g. scores of 0, 1, 2, with a maximum total score of 20. In this case, scores were multiplied by 5 to allow comparison with the original scaling.</P>
<P>Seven studies used the BI and contributed information to the meta-analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Dorner-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Dorner 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McMurdo-1993" TYPE="STUDY">McMurdo 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Resnick-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Resnick 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rosendahl-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Rosendahl 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sackley-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Sackley 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sackley-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Sackley 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Santana_x002d_Sosa-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Santana-Sosa 2008</LINK>). Where the rules of the residential home restricted the total score, e.g. participants not being allowed to go to the toilet alone, reducing the maximum score to 95/100, we ignored this in pooling studies. In <LINK REF="STD-McMurdo-1993" TYPE="STUDY">McMurdo 1993</LINK>, it was unclear which scale had been used, so we assumed use of the 0 to 20 scale, because this is most common in the UK, and the standard errors would have been unfeasibly tight for such a small study if the alternative had been used. In <LINK REF="STD-Santana_x002d_Sosa-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Santana-Sosa 2008</LINK>, the BI score was derived from the graphs presented in the publication. Five of these studies were cluster trials (<LINK REF="STD-McMurdo-1993" TYPE="STUDY">McMurdo 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Resnick-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Resnick 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rosendahl-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Rosendahl 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sackley-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Sackley 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sackley-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Sackley 2009</LINK>), although two only reported unadjusted results (<LINK REF="STD-McMurdo-1993" TYPE="STUDY">McMurdo 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rosendahl-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Rosendahl 2006</LINK>). We were able to adjust these results using an estimated intra-cluster correlation coefficient (ICC) of 0.38 based on <LINK REF="STD-Sackley-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Sackley 2006</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Sackley-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Sackley 2009</LINK>.</P>

We found similar results for the fixed-effect pooled estimate, with a BI five points higher (95% CI 2 to 7, P = 0.003) at follow-up than controls (<LINK REF="CMP-001.43" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.43</LINK>). There was substantial between-study heterogeneity (I² statistic = 48%, Q = 12 on 6 degrees of freedom (df), P = 0.07). Excluding cluster studies resulted in a much larger effect estimate of 18 points difference, with wide confidence intervals (95% CI 7 to 28, P = 0.001) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.44" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.44</LINK>), although this was based on two small studies.</P>
<P>The small number of studies limited the exploration of the potential sources of heterogeneity. There was no evidence that studies with a higher risk of bias had different measures of effect than those with a lower risk of bias (<LINK REF="CMP-001.07" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.7</LINK>) (P = 0.3). There was some evidence that studies with shorter interventions had larger effects than those with longer interventions (<LINK REF="CMP-001.08" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.8</LINK>) (P = 0.01). There was no evidence of differential effects on BI based on mode of delivery (<LINK REF="CMP-001.09" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.9</LINK>) (P = 0.3), baseline function (<LINK REF="CMP-001.10" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.10</LINK>) (P = 0.5), age (<LINK REF="CMP-001.11" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.11</LINK>) (P = 0.4), or gender (<LINK REF="CMP-001.12" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.12</LINK>) (P = 0.5).</P>
<P>There was some evidence of asymmetry in the contour-enhanced funnel plot (<LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK>) (Egger&#8217;s test P = 0.05), with larger studies indicating less benefit of rehabilitation.

<P>The rehabilitation group had a FIM on average 5.0 points higher than controls (95% CI -1.6 to 11.5, P = 0.1) when analysed with the random-effects method (<LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>).

There was substantial between-study heterogeneity (I² statistic = 71%, Q = 10 on 3df, P = 0.02).</P>
<P>The small number of studies limited the exploration of the potential sources of heterogeneity. All studies were categorised as higher risk of bias, so it was not possible to assess this as a source of heterogeneity (<LINK REF="CMP-001.13" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.13</LINK>). There was no evidence of differential effects on FIM based on duration of intervention (<LINK REF="CMP-001.14" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.14</LINK>) (P = 0.6) or mode of delivery (<LINK REF="CMP-001.15" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.15</LINK>) (P = 0.3). Comparing studies with differing mean functional independence at baseline (<LINK REF="CMP-001.16" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.16</LINK>) suggested that participants with greater functional independence benefited more from intervention than those with less function at baseline (P = 0.03). There was evidence that younger participants (less than 85 years) benefited more from rehabilitation in terms of functional independence than older participants (85 years and older) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.17" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.17</LINK>) (P = 0.001). This also reduced the excess heterogeneity in both groups (from I² statistic = 71% to I² statistic = 0% in each group separately). There was no evidence of differential effects on FIM due to gender (<LINK REF="CMP-001.18" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.18</LINK>) (P = 0.8).</P>

Twelve studies used the standard TUG test (<LINK REF="STD-Au_x002d_Yeung-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Au-Yeung 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Baum-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Baum 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bautmans-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Bautmans 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bruyere-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Bruyere 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cheung-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Cheung 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Christofoletti-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Christofoletti 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Donat-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Donat 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kerse-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Kerse 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lazowski-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Lazowski 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MacRitchie-2001" TYPE="STUDY">MacRitchie 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Peri-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Peri 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sackley-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Sackley 2009</LINK>). However, we could not include <LINK REF="STD-Sackley-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Sackley 2009</LINK> in the meta-analyses because the authors did not present TUG test results on the grounds of extensive missing data and substantial variation in individual results. We could not include <LINK REF="STD-Donat-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Donat 2007</LINK> in the meta-analyses because the study did not present a measure of variation in the outcome (e.g. standard error, standard deviation, or confidence interval). We excluded <LINK REF="STD-Christofoletti-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Christofoletti 2008</LINK> because of substantial baseline imbalance that persisted throughout the duration of the trial, with the control group taking more than twice as long to complete the TUG test before any intervention. We present below an analysis that re-includes these data. We analysed two studies in a separate meta-analysis because they compared exercise plus whole body vibration with exercise alone, so both groups contained a rehabilitative intervention (<LINK REF="STD-Bautmans-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Bautmans 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bruyere-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Bruyere 2005</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Kerse-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Kerse 2008</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Peri-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Peri 2008</LINK> were cluster randomised trials and presented appropriately adjusted analyses.</P>
<P>The rehabilitation group was five seconds quicker on average at follow-up than controls (95% CI -9 to 0, P = 0.05) when analysed with the random-effects method (<LINK REF="CMP-001.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.4</LINK>). We observed substantial excess heterogeneity (I² statistic = 65%, Q = 17 on 6df, P = 0.009). The fixed-effect pooled estimate was similar: Rehabilitation groups had TUG test results four seconds quicker than controls (95% CI -6 to -1), and this was statistically significant (P = 0.001) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.47" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.47</LINK>). The sensitivity analysis excluding cluster trials (<LINK REF="CMP-001.48" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.48</LINK>) was significant (P = 0.02) and estimated a larger effect, with rehabilitation groups an average eight seconds faster, but with wide confidence intervals (95% CI -14 to -2). The sensitivity analysis including the study with substantial baseline imbalance (<LINK REF="STD-Christofoletti-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Christofoletti 2008</LINK>) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.49" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.49</LINK>) was significant (P = 0.02) and estimated a larger effect, with rehabilitation groups an average eight seconds faster, but wide confidence intervals (95% CI -16 to -1) and further increased heterogeneity (I² statistic = 89%, Q = 65 on 7df, P &lt; 0.00001).</P>
<P>Exploring the heterogeneity, we categorised only one study as lower risk of bias, and there was no evidence that this study had different measures of effect on TUG test scores than those with a higher risk of bias (<LINK REF="CMP-001.25" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.25</LINK>) (P = 0.1). There was some evidence that studies with shorter interventions had larger effects than those with longer interventions (<LINK REF="CMP-001.26" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.26</LINK>) (P = 0.06), though numbers of studies were small, and there was still substantial heterogeneity between studies with less than six months' intervention. There was no evidence that group interventions differed in effect from individual interventions (<LINK REF="CMP-001.27" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.27</LINK>) (P = 0.9). There was some evidence that participants with greater mobility benefited more from rehabilitation than those with less mobility at baseline (<LINK REF="CMP-001.28" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.28</LINK>) (P = 0.06). However, the numbers of studies in each subgroup were small, and substantial heterogeneity remained between studies with lower TUG test scores. A post-hoc analysis, moving the median study from the more mobile group to the less mobile group, found no evidence of this difference (P = 0.8). There was no evidence of difference in pooled estimates due to age (<LINK REF="CMP-001.29" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.29)</LINK> (P = 1.0). There was some evidence that participants in studies with a higher proportion of women (more than 80% compared with 80% or less) had lower (better) TUG test scores than those with a lower proportion of women (<LINK REF="CMP-001.30" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.30</LINK>) (P = 0.05).</P>
<P>There was no evidence of asymmetry in the contour-enhanced funnel plot (<LINK REF="FIG-04" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 4</LINK>) (Egger&#8217;s test P = 0.4).</P>
<P>The whole body vibration plus exercise (experimental rehabilitation) group was eight seconds quicker on average at follow-up than exercise alone (control rehabilitation) (95% CI -19 to 3, P = 0.2) when analysed with the random-effects method (<LINK REF="CMP-002.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.1</LINK>). The fixed-effect pooled estimate was similar, with the experimental group seven seconds quicker (<LINK REF="CMP-002.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.3</LINK>) (95% CI -11 to -3, P = 0.0002). We observed substantial excess heterogeneity (I² statistic = 89%, Q = 9 on 1df, P = 0.003). However, because there were only two studies, we did not conduct subgroup analyses.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Walking time and speed over fixed distance</HEADING>
<P>To investigate walking as a functional ability, we combined measures of time to walk a fixed distance with measures of speed over a fixed distance, converting these into speed in metres per second (m/s). We anticipated that varied distances may impact on speed to walk that distance. Therefore, to reduce heterogeneity, we decided a priori to only combine studies over a fixed distance (i.e. excluding studies of maximum distance walked in a fixed time) and for that fixed distance to be less than 10 metres. Where measures of 'fast' walking and 'normal' walking were available, we selected normal walking speed, again to reduce heterogeneity.</P>
<P>Fifteen studies met these criteria, but only nine studies contributed information to the meta-analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Au_x002d_Yeung-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Au-Yeung 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Brill-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Brill 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chin-A-Paw-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Chin A Paw 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hruda-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Hruda 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lazowski-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Lazowski 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MacRitchie-2001" TYPE="STUDY">MacRitchie 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rolland-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Rolland 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rosendahl-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Rosendahl 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schoenfelder-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Schoenfelder 2004</LINK>). One study did not report numeric results for the walking outcome (<LINK REF="STD-Schnelle-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Schnelle 1996</LINK>); two studies did not present any measure of variation in the outcome (<LINK REF="STD-Schnelle-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Schnelle 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schoenfelder-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Schoenfelder 2000</LINK>); and three studies only presented results as change in time, which we were unable to convert into change in speed (<LINK REF="STD-Choi-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Choi 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fiatarone-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Fiatarone 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Meuleman-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Meuleman 2000</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Rosendahl-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Rosendahl 2006</LINK> was a cluster randomised trial, but did not present correctly adjusted results, although they claimed results were similar. Because other trials were not cluster trials, we could not estimate an ICC from them. We were also unable to identify a suitable ICC estimate from external sources. Therefore, we presented the unadjusted results.</P>
<P>The rehabilitation group were on average 0.03 m/s (95% CI -0.01 to 0.07, P = 0.1) faster at walking a fixed distance less than 10 metres than controls when analysed with the random-effects method (<LINK REF="CMP-001.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.5</LINK>). There was very little between-study heterogeneity (I² statistic = 9%, Q = 9 on 8df, P = 0.4). Therefore, the fixed-effect pooled estimate was similar, also estimating that rehabilitation groups had a walking speed of on average 0.03 m/s faster over a fixed distance (95% CI 0.00 to 0.06, P = 0.02) at follow-up than controls (<LINK REF="CMP-001.50" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.50</LINK>). While statistically significant, this is a small effect and was not significant in the random-effects analysis. The sensitivity analysis excluding the one cluster trial (<LINK REF="CMP-001.51" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.51</LINK>) further reduced the estimated effect to an increase of 0.01 m/s (95% CI -0.05 to 0.08, P = 0.7) and slightly increased between-study heterogeneity (I² statistic = 16%, Q = 8 on 7df, P = 0.3).</P>
<P>We categorised only <LINK REF="STD-Chin-A-Paw-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Chin A Paw 2004</LINK> as lower risk of bias, which appeared to be significantly different from the other studies, which were higher risk of bias (<LINK REF="CMP-001.31" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.31</LINK>) (P = 0.01), implying that studies with lower risk of bias recorded less impact of the rehabilitation. However, this was based on only one lower risk study, which differed in other ways, e.g. type of intervention, duration of intervention, and distance walked to measure speed. There was no evidence of differential effects due to duration of interventions (<LINK REF="CMP-001.32" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.32</LINK>) (P = 0.7), mode of delivery (<LINK REF="CMP-001.33" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.33</LINK>) (P = 0.6), or baseline walking speeds (<LINK REF="CMP-001.34" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.34</LINK>) (P = 0.6). All these studies had mean participant ages less than our predetermined threshold (less than 85 years), so we could not assess age as a potential source of heterogeneity in this outcome (<LINK REF="CMP-001.35" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.35</LINK>). There was no evidence of differential effects due to gender (<LINK REF="CMP-001.36" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.36</LINK>) (P = 0.2). There was no evidence that studies testing walking speeds over shorter distances measured different responses to rehabilitation than those testing over longer distances (<LINK REF="CMP-001.37" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.37</LINK>) (P = 0.5).</P>
<P>There was no evidence of any asymmetry in the contour-enhanced funnel plot (<LINK REF="FIG-05" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 5</LINK>) (Egger&#8217;s test P = 1.0).</P>

The participants in <LINK REF="STD-Meuleman-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Meuleman 2000</LINK> did not sustain the significant differences seen after four to eight weeks training at 6 or 12 months.

Similarly, <LINK REF="STD-Chin-A-Paw-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Chin A Paw 2004</LINK> reported that 8 of 173 participants found the intervention "too intensive" and discontinued it. <LINK REF="STD-Brittle-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Brittle 2009</LINK> reported that cognitive impairment in 9 of 28 participants either rendered them unable to follow the instructions or disruptive. <LINK REF="STD-Peri-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Peri 2008</LINK> reported that varying adherence across sites, in a programme implemented by care-home staff, appeared to be related to resource.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Approaches to increase intervention compliance or quantity</HEADING>
<P>Four trials investigated different ways of maximising compliance, the amount of exercise a participant took, or both. Two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Riccio-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Riccio 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yoder-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Yoder 1989</LINK>) found verbally elicited imagery of purposeful activity resulted in more exercise than rote repetitions (P &lt; 0.05). Two studies (<LINK REF="STD-DeKuiper-1993" TYPE="STUDY">DeKuiper 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lang-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Lang 1992</LINK>) found that participants exercised more when engaged in activity with a real object compared to an imaginary one. This suggests that adding purpose and asking participants to work with an actual object is an effective way of increasing exercise quantity. Similarly, including conversation during walking exercises improved compliance (<LINK REF="STD-Tappen-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Tappen 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tappen-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Tappen 2000</LINK>), preventing the physical decline observed in the conversation-only and walk-only groups. <LINK REF="STD-Donat-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Donat 2007</LINK> compared supervised and unsupervised exercise, with four unsupervised and two supervised participants giving up (21 in each group). <LINK REF="STD-Karl-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Karl 1982</LINK> argued that perceived irrelevance of the intervention to participants' lives was the main cause of lack of success, and proposed that individualised interventions might have been more effective.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Adverse events</HEADING>
<P>Few studies reported adverse events that were directly attributable to their intervention. Many reported morbidity and mortality for their participants during the trial period. However, morbidity and mortality should be expected among this population because of their age and often poor physical condition, making causality difficult to establish. The studies assessing whole body vibration reported some adverse events. <LINK REF="STD-Bautmans-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Bautmans 2005</LINK> reports one participant developing a phobia of the treatment room. Other adverse events included the following: one case of groin pain (<LINK REF="STD-Bautmans-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Bautmans 2005</LINK>) and two cases of lower limb tingling (<LINK REF="STD-Bruyere-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Bruyere 2005</LINK>). Among other intervention types, few reported any problems. One of the only other studies to report adverse events was in the study by Rosendahl, et al (191 participants) of high intensity functional exercise and nutritional supplementation (<LINK REF="STD-Rosendahl-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Rosendahl 2006</LINK>). They reported that adverse events occurred in 9% of 1906 sessions. Of these, they classified only two as major: one case of chest pain and another of loss of balance, neither of which led to manifest injury or disease. <LINK REF="STD-Mulrow-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Mulrow 1994</LINK> found the intervention group suffered more, and more serious, falls, although this was not statistically significant. <LINK REF="STD-Rolland-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Rolland 2007</LINK> reported five falls occurring during the exercise sessions, one causing a head injury, although there was no significant difference in the number of falls between the groups over the 12-month programme. Six other studies found no significant difference in the number of falls between groups (<LINK REF="STD-Cheung-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Cheung 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Choi-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Choi 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Faber-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Faber 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kerse-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Kerse 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MacRitchie-2001" TYPE="STUDY">MacRitchie 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Peri-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Peri 2008</LINK>).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Morbidity and mortality</HEADING>
<P>Twenty-nine studies reported mortality within each group at the end of the intervention period, or we inferred it from reports of attrition. Fourteen of these studies were cluster trials, and we did not identify a suitable ICC by which to adjust the results; therefore, we presented unadjusted counts and events. <LINK REF="STD-Brittle-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Brittle 2009</LINK> reported mortality per group, but we did not include this in the meta-analysis because reports were at three and six months post-baseline, rather than at the end of the five-week intervention period. The meta-analysis for the 25 rehabilitation studies versus the control studies showed no evidence of an effect from a physical rehabilitation intervention (<LINK REF="CMP-001.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.6</LINK>) (P = 0.5), with the risk ratio slightly favouring the rehabilitation group (0.95, 95% CI 0.8 to 1.1). There was almost no excess between-study heterogeneity (I² = 0%, Q = 11 on 17df, P = 0.9). There is little evidence of asymmetry in the funnel plot (<LINK REF="FIG-06" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 6</LINK>). Prespecified sensitivity analyses also yielded no evidence of an effect with alternative methods (odds ratio (OR), <LINK REF="CMP-001.52" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.52</LINK>; risk difference, <LINK REF="CMP-001.53" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.53</LINK>; fixed-effect, <LINK REF="CMP-001.54" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.54</LINK>; and Peto odds ratio, <LINK REF="CMP-001.55" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.55</LINK>). Excluding cluster trials resulted in a similar risk ratio, but with wider confidence intervals (0.93, 95% CI 0.60 to 1.44, P = 0.8) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.56" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.56</LINK>). Results of a post-hoc sensitivity analysis including <LINK REF="STD-Brittle-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Brittle 2009</LINK> were very similar to the primary analysis (<LINK REF="CMP-001.57" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.57</LINK>) (P = 0.5). None of the prespecified subgroup analyses suggested differential mortality between studies based on risk of bias (<LINK REF="CMP-001.38" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.38</LINK>) (P = 0.4), duration of intervention (<LINK REF="CMP-001.39" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.39</LINK>) (P = 0.5), mode of delivery (<LINK REF="CMP-001.40" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.40</LINK>) (P = 0.6), age (<LINK REF="CMP-001.41" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.41</LINK>) (P = 0.4), or gender (<LINK REF="CMP-001.42" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.42</LINK>) (P = 0.9). Four studies contributed to the meta-analysis of rehabilitation (experimental) versus rehabilitation (control), but only one death was reported across these studies, leading to no evidence of an effect (<LINK REF="CMP-002.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.2</LINK>) (risk ratio = 2.7, 95% CI 0.1 to 61, P = 0.5).</P>
<P>Several studies reported hospitalisations. <LINK REF="STD-Rolland-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Rolland 2007</LINK> reported a significantly increased number of hospitalisations per participant within the exercise group (at 12 months, 0.6 (1.3) versus 0.2 (0.6), P = 0.04). <LINK REF="STD-Meuleman-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Meuleman 2000</LINK> found significantly fewer hospitalisations and significantly fewer days admitted to hospital among the intervention group compared to the control group (at 12 months, 0.2 versus 0.7, P = 0.005; and 2.3 versus 7.6, P = 0.005, respectively). <LINK REF="STD-Kerse-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Kerse 2008</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Schnelle-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Schnelle 2002</LINK> found no significant difference.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-01-25 12:19:05 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Tom Crocker">
<P>The present studies provide preliminary evidence that physical rehabilitation interventions may be associated with significant improvements across various measures of physical and mental functioning, without increasing the mortality risk in elderly care-home residents. This is traditionally regarded as a group that is hard to research, but this review has found a substantial body of evidence. Many studies concluded that their intervention was both successful and safe, achieving their study goals. However, these are mostly explanatory trials that require replication in routine care and direct comparison between different interventions. At present, there is no clear indication of the optimum type of intervention.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Activities of daily living</HEADING>
<P>There is some evidence that activities of daily living (ADL) independence and performance in this population are enhanced, or decline less, through physical rehabilitation interventions when compared with usual care. All of the point estimates for measures of ADL for which we performed meta-analyses favour rehabilitation, and two have statistically significant random-effects estimates (Barthel Index (BI), Rivermead Mobility Index (RMI)). The fixed-effect models are significant for all measures except the Functional Independence Measure (FIM), although the heterogeneity expected and observed in many of the analyses suggest we should consider fixed-effect estimates with caution. The RMI estimate, which is significant in both models, is of note for only pooling studies of lower risk of bias. In each of the analyses of independence scales, the point estimates of the effect were approximately 5% of the scale total. For the Timed Up and Go (TUG) test, the point estimate was approximately 15% of the mean baseline time, while for walking speed, the point estimate was approximately 5% of the mean baseline speed. While these are not large effects, they at least imply a stabilisation of function. It should be remembered that these are estimates of the average intervention effect, which may vary widely with some interventions resulting in smaller or larger effects. Of interest is the large difference between TUG test estimate and walking speed estimate, which could conceivably suggest a greater effect of rehabilitation on standing up, sitting down, or turning around than walking speed. Alternatively, it may relate to differences in the participants, interventions, or other study features.</P>
<P>The subgroup analyses did not provide clear evidence across measures of sources of heterogeneity in effects, although the small number of studies in each subgroup hampered this. For all but one of the measures, there were greater estimates of effect in studies with participants with better baseline function, but this was only significant in one analysis (FIM). There was some evidence that shorter interventions had larger effects than longer interventions based on the BI and TUG test, but not other outcome measures. We did not perform subgroup analyses of interventions, which varied widely. It is plausible that some of the heterogeneity observed is related to differences in effect between interventions.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Secondary outcomes</HEADING>
<P>Many of the studies measuring strength, flexibility, and balance found significant differences favouring the intervention. There was little evidence about the effect on exercise tolerance and perceived health status. There was some evidence of effect on mood and little evidence of effect on cognition and fear of falling. However, it should be noted that we excluded interventions primarily targeting improvements in cognitive, psychological, or psychosocial outcomes and multi-faceted falls interventions from this review. Therefore, it is possible that physical interventions other than those in the included studies would show greater evidence of effect on these outcomes or outcomes such as quality of life. There was very limited economic evidence and no cost-benefit analyses among the trials. Evidence from several trials suggests that ensuring an intervention is perceived as relevant and important by participants may be crucial to its success.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Adverse outcomes</HEADING>
<P>The meta-analysis of mortality provides good evidence that rehabilitation does not increase mortality risk. Subgroup analyses also suggested there were not different effects among different types of participant (age or gender). There was relatively little evidence about other adverse outcomes. Most trials included very frail elderly individuals, among whom relatively high rates of morbidity and mortality would be expected, and high morbidity was often reported at baseline.</P>

<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2013-01-22 10:45:24 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Tom Crocker">
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Dominance of North American research</HEADING>
<P>Of the 67 included studies, 36 took place in North America. This may be problematic if there are large differences in the nature of long-term care in North America or in the characteristics, such as age and physical condition, of the people who receive the intervention, when compared with Europe or the rest of the world. As a consequence, the present findings may be difficult to apply to long-term care settings elsewhere. However, the increase in nationalities represented in this update is welcome. We have described the characteristics of the participants and the interventions. The interventions may be effective in this frail elderly client group regardless of location of care, but this hypothesis remains to be tested.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Participant representativeness</HEADING>
<P>The extent to which participants in the included studies are representative of the wider population residing in long-term care is unclear. This may present more of a problem where sample sizes were small, participant attrition was high, or both. It is notable that where studies did report the number of eligible individuals within the facility, on average they excluded more than half of its residents and less than one quarter of residents ultimately participated. This might suggest that the participant sample is not representative of the wider long-term care population. However, some studies included participants with multiple comorbidities and severe physical and cognitive disabilities.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Participant variation</HEADING>
<P>There is substantial variation in the physical condition and mental health of people aged over 65 years in long-term care. It is improbable that the same intervention will be appropriate for all people. However, the subgroup analyses failed to identify clear differences in effect between different studies based on participant characteristics.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Economics</HEADING>
<P>A convincing economic case for rehabilitation has yet to be made. Conceptually, it seems reasonable: improving physical condition should reduce ill health, reducing the burden of the individual on health care, the need for hospital treatment, and intensive personal care. Evidence for this would have to demonstrate that the absolute cost of the intervention is less than the amount the individual would cost if they remained in the same condition or deteriorated. A further effect to consider in an economic analysis is the additional cost of increased length of stay in long-term care that may result from a rehabilitative intervention increasing life expectancy. Consideration would also have to be given to the variety of funding models. Because of the variation between individuals in resource use, we will require large trials to evaluate economic arguments. Widespread provision of interventions, however effective they are in practical terms, are only likely to occur once a viable financial case has been demonstrated. However, benefits may go beyond reductions in healthcare costs to improvements in quality of life; these should be quantified and accounted for in future economic analysis.</P>
<P>Research conducted among the long-term care population may also be informative and applicable to similarly frail elderly people residing in the community. While none of the present trials investigated this adequately, it is reasonable to include it in future research.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2013-01-22 10:45:44 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Tom Crocker">
<P>Overall, we included 67 studies, featuring 6300 participants, in this review. Within the analyses of specific outcomes, these numbers were reduced as each study only contributed data to some comparisons. Between three and nine studies contributed to each meta-analysis of ADL outcome measures. The direction of the effect estimates in these meta-analyses was consistently in favour of rehabilitation, though not always statistically significant. Twenty-five studies contributed to the meta-analysis of mortality where rehabilitation was compared with control.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Risk of bias</HEADING>
<P>It is possible that biases have resulted in overestimation of the effects. Most of the included studies had unclear or high risk of bias across most categories. Blinding of participants and personnel was particularly problematic, a common limitation of trials of rehabilitative interventions. The risk of selective reporting was also often unclear, in part due to the range of different outcomes measured. A large number of studies also had substantially incomplete outcome data, often due to high and differential rates of attrition. However, there was evidence of an effect on the RMI among studies with the lowest risk of bias in this review. Yet, for the three measures where lower and higher risk of bias studies could be compared (BI, TUG test, and walking speed), lower estimates of effect were found in studies with lower risk of bias. However, this was only significant for one analysis (walking speed), and each comparison included only one or two lower risk studies. Based on funnel plots and Egger's test, there was little evidence of small studies effects.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Trial diversity</HEADING>
<P>It was disappointing that the huge variety of outcome measures used precluded a comprehensive meta-analysis. While creative variation in interventions is desirable for promoting innovation, the extent of the diversity among these trials, in both interventions and in the extensive number of outcome measures used, is highly problematic. A particular obstacle was the small number of trials replicating previous work. Where replications occurred, most often the same research group within the same location undertook them.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Intervention fidelity</HEADING>
<P>High levels of participant attrition and poor compliance with the intervention's demands were a fairly frequent problem among these trials. This is understandable; many participants would have been unused to activity and physically frail, making them vulnerable to illness and limiting their life expectancy. Many researchers reported reluctance to comply with intervention demands and felt this apathy adversely affected the trial. While it is impossible to prevent attrition through illness and death, it should be possible to improve motivation and compliance with interventions; enjoyment of, and satisfaction with, the intervention among participants should be a priority, especially if long-term and widespread provision is ultimately intended. Ways of achieving this might include ensuring that participants perceive the intervention to be both relevant and beneficial to their lives. Many trials included social elements in both the intervention and the control group; the relationship between use of such methods and compliance requires further exploration. Incorporating the therapy into daily activities as opposed to discreet sessions also warrants closer attention.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Long-term follow up</HEADING>
<P>The lack of postintervention follow up is problematic. Among the trials that did follow participants after the intervention (for a maximum of one year, most often three months),<B> </B>there was frequently no finding of intervention benefits. However, this was also often the case in these studies at the end of the intervention. It is hard to justify provision of any short-term rehabilitation intervention if any benefits the individual gains dissipate as soon as it ends. However, if benefits are sustained while the intervention remains in place, the economic and practical viability of long-term or indefinite provision need to be assessed. Moreover, some studies addressed interventions that were designed to become self-sustaining, delivered by care-home staff after an initial training and support period. Future research should follow participants for a reasonable period postintervention to clarify the durability of improvements and whether some participants require some type of long-term maintenance. If this is the case, interventions should be designed with long-term provision as a clear consideration and sustainability of the programmes evaluated.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Cluster trials</HEADING>
<P>While 19 of the studies used cluster randomisation, only six of the studies adjusted for this in their analysis. Where we have been unable to adjust these estimates (walking speed and mortality outcomes), the cluster studies are likely to have overly narrow confidence intervals and receive excess weight in the meta-analyses. Excluding cluster trials from the meta-analyses typically resulted in an increase in effect size, although for walking speed the estimated difference decreased. The use of cluster randomisation for this type of intervention and setting will often be appropriate, as the approach can help researchers to guard against contamination and identification of the experimental intervention by staff and residents. It is also possible that some interventions may have an effect at the group level, perhaps acting through culture or opportunities to socialise, although there was no evidence of this in the sensitivity analyses conducted.</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2013-01-22 10:45:53 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Tom Crocker">
<P>We identified a considerable amount of literature for this systematic review, providing confidence in our search strategy and indicating the wealth of innovative research. The 67 included studies included 6300 participants. We have not included possible evidence from two studies in this review because they are awaiting translation (<LINK REF="STD-de-Greef--2006" TYPE="STUDY">de Greef 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sung-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Sung 2007</LINK>). A further 29 studies are awaiting assessment, and the additional information contained could have an important impact on the conclusions of the review. Identification of this volume of literature created its own problems. The included studies present an almost overwhelming number of different interventions, ranging from traditional exercise programmes to those requiring access to machinery, and the huge variety of outcome measures used hampered our ability to synthesise the evidence and compare the effectiveness of different interventions in different types of participant and in different circumstances. Two authors extracted all data, and this was combined automatically for numerical data where there was consensus and manually for qualitative data and conflicting results, giving confidence in its quality. We performed a variety of sensitivity analyses to evaluate the robustness of the outcomes of meta-analyses. A relatively low number of studies contributed to our analysis of ADL outcomes because many studies reported a measure that could not be quantitatively combined with others. However, we do not believe this has biased results. We included five of the seven lower risk of bias studies. The 24 studies represented almost half of the participants from the 67 included studies (3139/6300). The new analyses provided an estimate of the effect size, reducing our optimism about the effectiveness of physical rehabilitation in this population expressed in the original version of this review.</P>

<P>Two other systematic reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Rydwik-2004a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rydwik 2004a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Weening_x002d_Dijksterhuis-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weening-Dijksterhuis 2011</LINK>) evaluated the effects of physical rehabilitation on elderly residents in long-term care. Both suggest there is moderate to good evidence of effects on strength, mobility, and flexibility. <LINK REF="REF-Weening_x002d_Dijksterhuis-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weening-Dijksterhuis 2011</LINK> also concluded there were significant positive effects on balance and ADL, while <LINK REF="REF-Rydwik-2004a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rydwik 2004a</LINK> found contradictory evidence for these outcomes. The current review, including more studies overall and excluding multi-faceted falls interventions, finds significant positive effects on all of these outcomes, although the effect size appears small.

<P>The included studies provide evidence that physical rehabilitation interventions for elderly people residing in long-term care may be both safe and effective, improving physical and possibly mental state. However, the size and duration of the effects of physical rehabilitation interventions are unclear. Although physical rehabilitation may be beneficial for care-home residents, the specific type(s) with most benefit, and how these relate to resident characteristics, is unclear.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2013-01-25 12:03:22 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>Current research suggests rehabilitation improves short-term function in ADL and is safe among elderly residents of long-term care, but the evidence for this is limited by plausible risk of bias, inconsistency, and incompleteness in the outcomes reported. Further research is needed to establish the sustainability of any improvements, to demonstrate the effect of interventions on quality of life and caregiver satisfaction, to optimise interventions, to establish how individual differences (for example, age, gender, frailty, mental state) may affect treatment outcomes, and whether different interventions should be applied to disability-based subgroups. The provision of rehabilitation services to this client group requires robust health economic evaluation. Of the ongoing studies and those awaiting assessment, a variety of measures of well-being, life satisfaction, and perceived health status are in use and one is conducting a cost-effectiveness evaluation (<LINK REF="STD-Gerritsen-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Gerritsen 2011</LINK>). We described the characteristics of the participants and the interventions. The interventions may be applicable to this frail elderly client group regardless of location of care, but this hypothesis requires testing in future research. Future research should utilise mechanisms such as cluster randomisation and placebo interventions as part of an explicit strategy to blind participants and personnel to the experimental intervention. Publication of pre-study protocols for analysis and reporting of all outcome measures is particularly important given the wide variety of outcome measures used in these studies. Outcome measures should be chosen with care, for their relevance, sensitivity, feasibility, validity, and reliability and to allow comparison between studies. Future research should report outcomes per group for mortality, fall incidence, number of participants who fell at least once, hospitalisation incidence, number of participants hospitalised at least once, and incidence of minor injuries.</P>

However, we have not included such varied measures in meta-analysis because we lack the individual level data required to do this.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Search methods for identification of studies</HEADING>
<P>We originally planned to search SIGLE (System for Information on Grey Literature in Europe), but we did not do so because it is no longer accessible. Furthermore, we planned to handsearch relevant journals, but because of their inclusion in electronic databases and the extensive results returned through electronic searches, we considered this unnecessary. In addition to the planned searches, we searched Google Scholar.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Data collection and analysis</HEADING>
<P>We replaced the assessment of methodological quality described in the protocol and undertaken in the original review with The Cochrane Collaboration&#8217;s new 'Risk of bias' assessment tool (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). We reassessed all studies in the original review in line with these criteria. We performed data collection on a standardised electronic database, rather than a paper form. We clarified our approach to analysing data from cluster trials. We originally intended to combine results in a fixed-effect meta-analysis where sufficient homogeneity existed. However, because of the extensive heterogeneity in interventions (contents, intensity, and duration), we used a random-effects meta-analysis as our primary approach, but we still report the results of fixed-effect models as sensitivity analyses. We did not perform all the subgroup analyses originally proposed in the protocol because there are too few pathology-specific interventions for any one pathology, and studies often include both nursing and residential care homes. However, both of these groupings were partly intended to split participants by functional ability. Therefore, we instead grouped studies by baseline function in the measure being analysed. In addition to the subgroups suggested in the protocol, we added gender, duration of intervention, and risk of bias. We specified all of these subgroups before analysis commenced and presented and reported all of them for each measure.</P>

<P>Study aim or objective: to examine the effect of different training protocols on quality of life, vitality, and depression of older adults living in long-term care facilities<BR/>4 groups:<BR/>
<BR/>Intervention: combined training (N = 56)<BR/>Format: group; delivered by: trained physical therapist and assistant<BR/>Session length: 40 to 60 minutes, twice weekly<BR/>A complete strength training session (2 x 12 reps of 5 exercises, once weekly) and a complete functional training session (once weekly)<BR/>
<BR/>Strength: resistance increased until 2 sets of 8 to 12 reps possible. Progressively increased when 2 x 12 reps achieved at 2 sessions. Warm-up of 10 to 20 reps at minimal resistance. The 5 exercises were leg press; latissimus pull down; biceps curl and triceps press on TechnoGym equipment; and heel raises with dumbbells (1 to 5 kg each), or ankle or wrist weights (1 and 2 kg per pair), or some combination of these. For the heel raises, the number of repetitions were increased if the participants could lift the maximum weight (2 × 5 kg dumbbells + 2 × 2 kg ankle weights)<BR/>Functional: warm-up of walking and movement to music, followed by 30 to 35 minutes of skills training in game-like and co-operative activities, such as throwing and catching a ball while standing up and sitting down on a chair, musical chairs, and team pursuit races<BR/>
<BR/>Control 1 (of 3): functional-skills training (N = 60)<BR/>Program designed to improve muscle strength, speed, endurance, co-ordination and flexibility to improve functional performance of common daily activities. An emphasis was placed on skills training, meaning that the specific activities required for independence in daily activities were practiced. Classes started with 5 to 10 minutes of warm-up activities: walking (whenever possible), exercise-to-music routines, becoming familiar with the equipment, followed by 30 to 35 minutes of skills training in game-like and co-operative activities, such as throwing and catching a ball while standing up and sitting down on a chair, musical chairs, and team pursuit races. The cool-down period (5 to 10 minutes) consisted of stretching and relaxation activities (e.g. finger and wrist rolls, shoulder rolls, reaching, leg stretches). Exercises adjusted to individual mobility level. The intensity was gradually increased: the number of repetitions increased, exercises were performed more often standing up straight, and the use of wrist and ankle weights (1 and 2 kg per pair) was stimulated</P>
<P>Control 2 (of 3): strength training (N = 57)<BR/>Program designed to improve muscle strength of major muscle groups of both upper and lower body, important for functional performance on common daily activities. 5 exercises: leg press, latissimus pull down, biceps curl and triceps press on TechnoGym equipment, and heel raises with dumbbells (1 to 5 kg each); ankle or wrist weights, or both (1 and 2 kg per pair). In the first 2 weeks, participants were familiarised with the equipment and the technique of the exercises by exercising with minimal resistance. The following weeks, resistance increased until 2 sets of 8 to 12 repetitions were possible. Resistance was to be increased after the participant could complete 2 sets of 12 repetitions for 2 consecutive sessions. As a warm-up, each exercise was first performed 10 to 20 repetitions with minimal resistance. Progression was monitored with exercise logs filled out by the supervising physical therapist and assistant. Sessions closed with stretching exercises<BR/>
<BR/>Control 3 (of 3): control (educational) (N = 51)<BR/>An 'educational' program designed to provide attention and social interaction (i.e. group discussions about topics of interest to older people, such as history of the 20th century, music, relaxation, etc)<BR/>

Balance exercises progressed from being undertaken with eyes open to eyes closed and from undertaken with a support to without a support. For each exercise, the duration and number of repetitions increased as the participants' tolerance increased and as time progressed<BR/>
<BR/>Control: Unsupervised home exercise (UHE) group (N = 21)<BR/>Same exercise programme as SGE group<BR/>The physiotherapist demonstrated the exercises to the participants and then observed them practising the exercises once to ensure they understood how to do them properly. Participants were given a written exercise programme with a weekly chart to help them keep a record of what they had accomplished. On this chart the participants marked the exercises they completed on the various days. Furthermore, they were asked to come to meet the physiotherapist at the end of the second and fourth weeks in order to ensure the exercise programme was being performed properly and to discuss any problems encountered. At these meetings, the participants were also instructed on how to make the appropriate progressions to higher level exercises</P>

The core portion of the training session was divided into joint mobility, resistance, and co-ordination exercises. Joint mobility exercises focused on shoulder, wrist, hip, knee, and ankle joints. Resistance training included 9 exercises with elastic medium-resistance bands (3 sets of 15 repetitions each) engaging some of the major muscle groups: chest, biceps, triceps, shoulder, knee extensors, abductor and adductor muscles, and calf muscles. All exercises were performed through the full range of motion normally associated with correct technique for each exercise. Stretching exercises of muscles were performed at the end of each set of resistance exercises. Co-ordination exercises were performed with foam balls of gradually decreasing size over the program, e.g. bouncing a ball with both hands, tossing and catching a ball, etc. Music (from the participants' youth years) accompanied each session<BR/>

<FEEDBACK_SUMMARY MODIFIED="2013-01-25 12:47:49 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>During a recent course we gave on Cochrane Reviews, we discussed the topic of how to best make comparisons when a review includes many different kinds of interventions. We used your review as an example of a review that can include many studies but where the authors are then faced with the task of somehow grouping the interventions to produce useful comparisons. In your review you concluded that it was impossible to make comparisons because of the heterogeneity of the included studies. However, we felt that there would be several possibilities of making comparisons that would lead to more informative recommendations for the reader. We also found it difficult to follow how you came to your conclusion that provision of physical rehabilitation interventions to long-term care residents is worthwhile and safe, reducing disability with few adverse events.</P>
<P>We came to the conclusion that it is important to first separate studies that report primary outcomes from those that report secondary outcomes only. In your review, it would mean that you would first report about the studies that used a measure of ADL such as the Barthel Index or the FIM and then you would report on the studies that reported a secondary outcome only. We think that this information is lacking now. In addition, we concluded that it would be helpful to make a classification of the interventions based on their most important features. For your review, we assumed that exercise would be the most important feature of the biggest part of the interventions. Next we would subclassify exercise interventions according to their most important features. You already did this in your review with exercises that use imagery to enhance participation. All four studies that used imagery report endurance or the number of exercises that participants were able to perform and they use the same control group with rote exercise, which all in all makes for a perfectly homogenous comparison. Moreover, we thought that even when studies are heterogeneous, it is worthwhile to extract data about the outcomes and report them. In your review, you report outcomes only as the conclusions of the authors of the primary studies. This makes it, in our view, impossible to draw conclusions about the results. For example, four imagery studies with a non-significant outcome could well add up to a significant result in a meta-analysis. In our view, a meta-analysis of the four imagery studies would be well warranted by the homogeneity of the studies. This in turn could lead to a very relevant practical recommendation to use imagery to improve the results of exercise.</P>
<P>We hope that, with an update, better data extraction and better construction of comparisons will lead to better underpinned conclusions from this important review.</P>

<P>Many thanks for your comments on our review. The review was complex so we much appreciate any comments which will help us enhance the quality.</P>
<P>We are uncertain of the meaning of your first comment. We state in the review the number of trials reported an outcome measure related to ADL, our primary outcome measure.</P>
<P>We are currently updating the review and will consider classifying the interventions based on the most important features as you suggest.</P>
<P>We considered presentation of results in the review extremely carefully, and the current format seemed the best option at the time. However we are updating our review and during this process we will consider other ways of presenting the data.</P>
<P>We agree that it may be appropriate to undertake meta-analysis on the imagery studies.</P>
<P>Thank you for your comments, and the time you and your colleagues have taken to consider and feedback on our review. We will re-consider all your comments as we are up-dating.</P>
