<P>
<B>What is the issue?</B>
</P>
<P>The World Health Organization recommends that infants should be breastfed exclusively until six months of age with breastfeeding continuing as an important part of the infant&#8217;s diet until he or she is at least two years old. We know that breastfeeding is good for the short-term and long-term health of both infants and their mothers. Babies are less likely to develop infections in the digestive tract, lungs or airways, and ears. They are also less likely to become overweight and develop diabetes later in life. The mothers are less likely to develop diabetes and to experience breast or ovarian cancer. Many mothers may stop breastfeeding before they want to as a result of the problems they encounter. Good care and support may help women solve these problems so that they can continue to breastfeed.</P>
<P>
<B>Why is this important?</B>
</P>
<P>By knowing what kind of support can be provided to help mothers with breastfeeding, we can help them solve any problems and continue to breastfeed for as long as they want to, wherever they live. Stopping breastfeeding early may cause disappointment and distress for mothers and health problems for themselves and their infants. Support can be in the form of giving reassurance, praise, information, and the opportunity for women to discuss problems and ask questions as needed. This review looked at whether providing extra organised support for breastfeeding mothers would help mothers to continue to breastfeed when compared with standard maternity care. We were interested in support from health professionals including midwives, nurses and doctors, or from trained lay workers such as community health workers and volunteers.</P>
<P>
<B>What evidence did we find?</B>
</P>
<P>We searched for evidence on 29 February 2016 and identified a further 31 new trials for inclusion in the review. This updated review now includes 100 randomised controlled studies involving more than 83,246 women. The 73 trials that contributed to the analyses were from 29 countries and involved 74,656 women. Some 62% of the women were from high-income countries, 34% from middle income countries and 4% from low-income countries</P>
<P>All forms of extra organised support analyzed together showed an increase in the length of time women continued to breastfeed, either with or without introducing any other types of liquids or foods. This meant that fewer women stopped any breastfeeding or exclusively breastfeeding (moderate quality evidence) before four to six weeks and before six months. Both trained volunteers and doctors and nurses had a positive impact on breastfeeding.</P>
<P>Factors that may have contributed to the success for women who exclusively breastfed were face-to-face contact (rather than contact by telephone), volunteer support, a specific schedule of four to eight contacts and high numbers of women who began breastfeeding in the community or population (background rates).</P>
<P>The term 'high-quality evidence' means that we are confident that further studies would provide similar findings. No outcome was assessed as being 'high-quality'. The term 'moderate-quality evidence' means that we found wide variations in the findings with some conflicting results in the studies in this review. New studies of different kinds of support for exclusive breastfeeding may change our understanding of how to help women to continue with exclusive breastfeeding.</P>
<P>The methodological quality of the studies was mixed and the components of the standard care interventions and extra support interventions varied a lot and were not always well described. Also, the settings for the studies and the women involved were diverse.</P>
<P>
<B>What does this mean?</B>
</P>
<P>Providing women with extra organised support helps them breastfeed their babies for longer. Breastfeeding support may be more helpful if it is predictable, scheduled, and includes ongoing visits with trained health professionals including midwives, nurses and doctors, or with trained volunteers. Different kinds of support may be needed in different geographical locations to meet the needs of the people within that location. We need additional randomised controlled studies to identify what kinds of support are the most helpful for women.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2017-01-05 11:43:40 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Alison McFadden">
<P>There is extensive evidence of important health risks for infants and mothers related to <I>not</I> breastfeeding. In 2003, the World Health Organization recommended that infants be breastfed exclusively until six months of age, with breastfeeding continuing as an important part of the infant&#8217;s diet until at least two years of age. However, current breastfeeding rates in many countries do not reflect this recommendation.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2017-01-04 12:41:54 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Alison McFadden">
<P>To describe forms of breastfeeding support which have been evaluated in controlled studies, the timing of the interventions and the settings in which they have been used.</P>
<P>To examine the effectiveness of different modes of offering similar supportive interventions (for example, whether the support offered was proactive or reactive, face-to-face or over the telephone), and whether interventions containing both antenatal and postnatal elements were more effective than those taking place in the postnatal period alone.</P>
<P>To examine the effectiveness of different care providers and (where information was available) training.</P>
<P>To explore the interaction between background breastfeeding rates and effectiveness of support.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-02-01 13:29:52 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This updated review includes 100 trials involving more than 83,246 mother-infant pairs of which 73 studies contribute data (58 individually-randomised trials and 15 cluster-randomised trials). We considered that the overall risk of bias of trials included in the review was mixed. Of the 31 new studies included in this update, 21 provided data for one or more of the primary outcomes. The total number of mother-infant pairs in the 73 studies that contributed data to this review is 74,656 (this total was 56,451 in the previous version of this review). The 73 studies were conducted in 29 countries. Results of the analyses continue to confirm that all forms of extra support analyzed together showed a decrease in cessation of 'any breastfeeding', which includes partial and exclusive breastfeeding (average risk ratio (RR) for stopping any breastfeeding before six months 0.91, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.88 to 0.95; <I>moderate-quality evidence, 51 studies) </I>and for stopping breastfeeding before four to six weeks (average RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.80 to 0.95; <I>moderate-quality evidence, 33 studies). </I>All forms of extra support together also showed a decrease in cessation of exclusive breastfeeding at six months (average RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.85 to 0.92; <I>moderate-quality evidence</I>, 46 studies) and at four to six weeks (average RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.71 to 0.89; <I>moderate quality</I>, 32 studies). We downgraded evidence to moderate-quality due to very high heterogeneity.</P>
<P>We investigated substantial heterogeneity for all four outcomes with subgroup analyses for the following covariates: who delivered care, type of support, timing of support, background breastfeeding rate and number of postnatal contacts. Covariates were not able to explain heterogeneity in general. Though the interaction tests were significant for some analyses, we advise caution in the interpretation of results for subgroups due to the heterogeneity. Extra support by both lay and professionals had a positive impact on breastfeeding outcomes. Several factors may have also improved results for women practising exclusive breastfeeding, such as interventions delivered with a face-to-face component, high background initiation rates of breastfeeding, lay support, and a specific schedule of four to eight contacts. However, because within-group heterogeneity remained high for all of these analyses, we advise caution when making specific conclusions based on subgroup results. We noted no evidence for subgroup differences for the any breastfeeding outcomes.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2017-01-04 12:47:17 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Alison McFadden">
<P>When breastfeeding support is offered to women, the duration and exclusivity of breastfeeding is increased. Characteristics of effective support include: that it is offered as standard by trained personnel during antenatal or postnatal care, that it includes ongoing scheduled visits so that women can predict when support will be available, and that it is tailored to the setting and the needs of the population group. Support is likely to be more effective in settings with high initiation rates. Support may be offered either by professional or lay/peer supporters, or a combination of both. Strategies that rely mainly on face-to-face support are more likely to succeed with women practising exclusive breastfeeding. </P>

<P>Breastfeeding has a fundamental impact on the short-, medium- and long-term health of children and has an important impact on women&#8217;s health (<LINK REF="REF-Victora-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Victora 2016</LINK>). For children, good quality evidence demonstrates that in both low-, middle- and high-income settings <I>not </I>breastfeeding contributes to mortality due to infectious diseases (<LINK REF="REF-Sankar-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sankar 2015</LINK>), hospitalisation for preventable disease such as gastroenteritis, and respiratory disease (<LINK REF="REF-Horta-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Horta 2013</LINK>), otitis media (<LINK REF="REF-Bowatte-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bowatte 2015</LINK>), increased rates of childhood diabetes and obesity (<LINK REF="REF-Horta-2015a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Horta 2015a</LINK>), and increased dental disease (<LINK REF="REF-Peres-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Peres 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tham-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tham 2015</LINK>). For women, there is good quality evidence that <I>not</I> breastfeeding is associated with increased risks of breast and ovarian cancer, and diabetes (<LINK REF="REF-Chowdhury-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chowdhury 2015</LINK>). Lactational amenorrhoea is associated with exclusive/predominant breastfeeding and increases birth spacing when other forms of contraception are not available (<LINK REF="REF-Chowdhury-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chowdhury 2015</LINK>). Not being breastfed has an adverse impact on intelligence quotient (IQ), and educational and behavioural outcomes for the child (<LINK REF="REF-Heikkil_x00e4_-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heikkilä 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Heikkil_x00e4_-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heikkilä 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Horta-2015b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Horta 2015b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Quigley-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Quigley 2012</LINK>). For many outcomes a dose-response relationship exists, with the greatest benefit resulting from breastfeeding exclusively, with no added food or fluids, for around six months, with breastfeeding continuing thereafter as an important component of the infant&#8217;s diet (<LINK REF="REF-Kramer-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kramer 2012</LINK>). The negative impact of not breastfeeding has been demonstrated in a range of settings and population groups, though the balance of risks and benefits varies from setting to setting; for example, gastroenteritis will result in much higher mortality in low-income countries (<LINK REF="REF-Horta-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Horta 2013</LINK>).</P>
<P>Few health behaviours have such a broad-spectrum and long-lasting impact on population health, with the potential to improve life chances, health and well-being. <LINK REF="REF-Victora-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Victora 2016</LINK> estimated that each year, 823,000 deaths in children under five years and 20,000 deaths from breast cancer could be prevented by near universal breastfeeding. The cost burden of not breastfeeding was estimated by <LINK REF="REF-Rollins-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rollins 2016</LINK> to represent 0.49% of world gross domestic product. The cost burden includes the cost of caring for children and women with chronic disease as well as short-term illness (<LINK REF="REF-Bartick-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bartick 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Smith-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smith 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>The established negative impact on a population of not breastfeeding has resulted in global and national support for encouraging the initiation and continuation of breastfeeding. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that, wherever possible, infants should be fed exclusively on breastmilk until six months of age (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2003</LINK>), with breastfeeding continuing as an important part of the infant&#8217;s diet until at least two years of age. Other agencies and countries have endorsed the recommendation to breastfeed exclusively to around six months of age (<LINK REF="REF-EFSA-Panel-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">EFSA Panel 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-National-Center-for-Health-Statistics-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">National Center for Health Statistics 2012</LINK>).</P>
<P>Due to the lack of standardised infant feeding indicators in high-income countries, it is difficult to compare rates of breastfeeding across high-income countries, or between high-income, and low- and middle-income countries. Therefore reported rates of breastfeeding need to be treated with caution. <LINK REF="REF-Victora-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Victora 2016</LINK> suggest that, in general, there is an inverse relationship between breastfeeding rates and national wealth, though this relationship does not necessarily hold at the level of population subgroups. In high-income countries, for example, the relationship is often seen to be the opposite, with rates higher among more affluent women (<LINK REF="REF-McAndrew-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">McAndrew 2012</LINK>).</P>
<P>Although some high-income countries such as, Norway and Finland have high rates of both initiation and continuation of breastfeeding (<LINK REF="REF-Cattaneo-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cattaneo 2010</LINK>), rates in many high-income countries are low. Initiation rates have risen in some high-income countries in recent years (<LINK REF="REF-NHS-England-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">NHS England 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-U.S.-Department-of-Health-and-Human-Services-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">U.S. Department of Health and Human Services 2011</LINK>), but there remains a marked decline in breastfeeding within the first few weeks after initiation, and exclusive breastfeeding to six months is rare (<LINK REF="REF-Cattaneo-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cattaneo 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McAndrew-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">McAndrew 2012</LINK>).</P>
<P>In middle- and low-income countries, while breastfeeding initiation and duration are generally higher than in high-income countries, the average rate of exclusive breastfeeding for children younger than six months is only 37% (<LINK REF="REF-Victora-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Victora 2016</LINK>). However, rates of exclusive breastfeeding for children younger than six months vary widely; Peru and Rwanda report rates of 72% and 85% respectively (<LINK REF="REF-UNICEF-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">UNICEF 2012</LINK>), while in Nigeria the rate is only 17%. In some low- and middle-income countries, cultural practices such as prelacteal feeds, and giving water or teas alongside breastfeeding, account for the low rates of exclusive breastfeeding (<LINK REF="REF-Kimani_x002d_Murage--2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kimani-Murage 2011</LINK>). This is particularly important as when breastfeeding continues for long periods of time, infant and young child mortality are reduced in the second year of life in low- and middle-income countries (<LINK REF="REF-Victora-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Victora 2016</LINK>).</P>
<P>Infant feeding is strongly related to inequalities in health, and, far from being an individual decision made by each woman, is influenced most strongly by structural determinants of health. The range of different rates of initiation and continuation of breastfeeding in different settings globally demonstrates that the key factors influencing infant feeding rates are likely to be sociocultural and related to societal and subgroup norms, public policy, and the availability of appropriate care and support, both professional and lay (<LINK REF="REF-EU-Project-on-Promotion-of-Breastfeeding-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">EU Project on Promotion of Breastfeeding 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rollins-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rollins 2016</LINK>). In high-income countries, for example, young mothers and women in low-income groups, or women who ceased full-time education at an early age, are least likely either to start breastfeeding or to continue for a period of time sufficient to benefit from the greatest health gain (<LINK REF="REF-McAndrew-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">McAndrew 2012</LINK>). Migrant women have been shown to adopt breastfeeding practices that are more similar to the country in which they live, than the country of their birth (<LINK REF="REF-McLachlan-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">McLachlan 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>The early discontinuation of breastfeeding is not a decision that is taken lightly by women; it is associated with a high prevalence of problems such as painful breasts and nipples, concern about adequacy of milk supply and about the baby&#8217;s behaviour, and, in some settings, embarrassment related to breastfeeding in public. Many mothers report distress related to the decision to discontinue breastfeeding (<LINK REF="REF-McAndrew-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">McAndrew 2012</LINK>), even in cultures where breastfeeding rates are high (<LINK REF="REF-Almqvist_x002d_Tangen-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Almqvist-Tangen 2012</LINK>). A key factor is the widespread lack of appropriate education for health professionals in the prevention and treatment of breastfeeding problems, which means that in a wide range of settings women commonly do not receive the quality of care needed from the health services (<LINK REF="REF-Cattaneo-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cattaneo 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Renfrew-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Renfrew 2006</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-Enkin-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Enkin 2000</LINK> notes that industrial societies, on the whole, do not provide women with the opportunity to observe other breastfeeding women before they attempt breastfeeding themselves. In such societies, where breastfeeding is not normative behaviour and women may find it socially challenging to breastfeed, women are at particular risk of finding a serious lack of support to continue breastfeeding.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2017-01-04 12:48:40 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Alison McFadden">
<P>&#8216;Support&#8217; is complex and can include several elements such as emotional and esteem-building support (including reassurance and praise), practical help, informational support (including the opportunity to discuss and respond to women&#8217;s questions) and social support (including signposting women to support groups and networks) (<LINK REF="REF-Dykes-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dykes 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schmied-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schmied 2011</LINK>). It can be offered in a range of ways, by health professionals or lay people, trained or untrained, in hospital and community settings. It can be offered to groups of women or one-to-one, it can involve mother-to-mother support, and it can include family members (typically fathers or grandmothers) and wider communities. Support can be offered proactively by contacting women directly, or reactively, by waiting for women to get in touch. It can be provided face-to-face, by telephone or through social media. It can involve only one contact or regular, ongoing contact over several months.</P>
<P>Support is a complex intervention that tackles the multifaceted challenge of enabling women to breastfeed, and it should not be surprising that it varies from setting to setting and from study to study. However, it is likely that different forms of support in different contexts will be differentially effective. The global Baby Friendly Hospital Initiative (Baby Friendly Initiative in some countries), which is a complex intervention incorporating 10 steps to successful breastfeeding, has been shown to be associated with increased breastfeeding rates (<LINK REF="REF-Labbok-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Labbok 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-P_x00e9_rez_x2010_Escamilla-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pérez&#8208;Escamilla 2016</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Venancio-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Venancio 2011</LINK>). Over 21,000 facilities in 198 countries have ever been accredited, representing 27.5% of maternities worldwide (<LINK REF="REF-Labbok-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Labbok 2012</LINK>), but most babies are still not born in a Baby Friendly environment.</P>
<P>In many settings, the health professionals who provide standard maternity care lack in-depth knowledge of the prevention and treatment of breastfeeding problems. Therefore training and education of health professionals and others who provide breastfeeding support is critical. To address this, WHO and UNICEF (the United Nations Children's Fund) have developed two breastfeeding training programmes: the 40-hour Breastfeeding Counselling, and the five-day Infant and Young Child Feeding Counselling, to train a cadre of health workers that can provide skilled support to breastfeeding mothers and help them overcome problems (<LINK REF="REF-WHO_x002f_UNICEF-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO/UNICEF 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO_x002f_UNICEF-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO/UNICEF 2006</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2016-06-30 14:32:18 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Alison McFadden">
<P>Support for breastfeeding women can work in different ways for different women. Timely, skilled support will help women to avoid or overcome breastfeeding problems that may lead to cessation of breastfeeding. In settings where breastfeeding is not the social norm, support can increase women&#8217;s belief in breastfeeding, and give them confidence to continue breastfeeding in the face of societal and family pressures that might undermine breastfeeding. In settings where exclusive breastfeeding is rare, support can dispel myths about the need for additional foods or fluids alongside breastfeeding to meet babies&#8217; nutritional needs.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2017-02-02 12:55:09 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>It is fundamentally important to examine the support that mothers receive when breastfeeding to determine what might be effective in helping women continue to breastfeed, whatever setting they live in. There is evidence that effective breastfeeding support interventions are cost-effective and likely to realise a return on investment within a few years (<LINK REF="REF-Renfrew-2012a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Renfrew 2012a</LINK>).</P>
<P>The purpose of this review is to examine interventions which provide extra support for mothers who are breastfeeding or considering breastfeeding; and to assess their impact on breastfeeding duration and exclusivity and, where recorded, on health outcomes and maternal satisfaction. This review is an update of the previously published version <LINK REF="REF-Renfrew-2012b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Renfrew 2012b</LINK>. The focus of this review is support for mothers and babies who are part of the general healthy population of their countries; mothers of premature and sick babies and mothers with some medical conditions have additional issues with breastfeeding, and interventions to support these mothers need to be reviewed separately. A Cochrane Review of breastfeeding education and support for mothers with multiple pregnancies is in progress (<LINK REF="REF-Whitford-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Whitford 2015</LINK>). Whilst many support interventions include breastfeeding education for mothers, our review excludes interventions described as solely educational in nature and interventions with no postnatal component. A Cochrane Review of antenatal breastfeeding education for increasing breastfeeding duration has been published (<LINK REF="REF-Lumbiganon-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lumbiganon 2012</LINK>).</P>
<P>Specific objectives of this review are to describe forms of support which have been evaluated in controlled studies, and the settings in which they have been used. It was also of interest to examine the effectiveness of different modes of offering similar supportive interventions (for example, face-to-face or over the telephone), whether interventions containing both antenatal and postnatal elements were more effective than those taking place in the postnatal period alone, and whether the support was offered proactively to women, or whether they needed to seek it out. We also planned to examine the effectiveness of different care providers, and the possible impact of background breastfeeding rates in the countries or areas where the trials took place on the effectiveness of supportive interventions. It is important to note that the support interventions offered were in addition to standard care, which varied from setting to setting, though there are few settings in which standard care is consistently offered by people with training and skill in enabling women to breastfeed.</P>

Primary outcomes were recorded for stopping any or exclusive breastfeeding before four to six weeks and before six months postpartum. Other outcomes of interest in previous versions of this review were stopping any or exclusive breastfeeding at other time points (two, three, four, nine and 12 months), measures of neonatal and infant morbidity (where available) and measures of maternal satisfaction with care or feeding method. Secondary outcomes were not considered in this update so that the review could be completed in time to inform the World Health Organisation&#8217;s review of the evidence and update of the WHO recommendations on breastfeeding in maternity facilities.

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Cluster-randomised trials</HEADING>
<P>There are 15 cluster-randomised trials in the analyses. Their sample sizes have been adjusted using the methods described in the <I>Handbook</I> and by <LINK REF="REF-Donner-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Donner 2000</LINK> incorporating an estimate of the intracluster correlation coefficient (ICC) derived from the trial (if possible). Where cluster adjusted confidence limits were presented but not the ICC, the design effect was estimated from comparison with limits based on the raw numbers. However, for <LINK REF="STD-Ochola-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Ochola 2013</LINK>, outcome one of <LINK REF="STD-Elliott_x002d_Rudder-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Elliott-Rudder 2014</LINK>, arm two of <LINK REF="STD-Yotebieng-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Yotebieng 2015</LINK>, adjusting for clustering based on the summary statistic made the standard error larger and the width of the confidence interval increased which resulted in a design of &lt;1. Therefore, the adjustment for clustering resulted in an increase of the error sum of squares for the raw numbers given. As this was nonsensical, no adjustment for clustering was made for these studies. We have synthesised the findings from individually- and cluster-randomised trials provided that there was little heterogeneity between the study designs and the interaction between the effect of intervention and the choice of randomisation unit was considered to be unlikely. We have carried out sensitivity analyses to investigate the effect of including cluster-randomised trials where no adjustment was possible. For all trials where ICCs were not reported, study authors will be contacted in the next version of the review.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Trials with multiple groups</HEADING>
<P>In order to avoid 'double counting' in studies involving one control group and two different interventions groups, we split the control group number of events and participants in half, so that we could include two independent comparisons, as per methods described the <I>Handbook </I>[section16.5.4].</P>

<P>For all outcomes, analyses were carried out, as far as possible, on an intention-to-treat basis, i.e. we attempted to include all participants randomised to each group in the analyses.

<HETEROGENEITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2017-01-04 13:46:28 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Alison McFadden">
<P>We assessed statistical heterogeneity in each meta-analysis using the Tau², I² and Chi² statistics. We regarded heterogeneity as substantial if I² was greater than 30% and either Tau² was greater than zero, or there was a low P value (less than 0.10) in the Chi² test for heterogeneity. If we identified substantial heterogeneity (above 30%), we planned to explore it by prespecified subgroup analysis. </P>

<P>For all outcomes we have ordered studies in terms of weight, where a sufficient number of studies contributed data, we have generated funnel plots. We examined plots visually to see whether there was any evidence of asymmetry that might suggest different treatment effects in smaller studies, which may indicate publication bias (<A HREF="https://archie.cochrane.org/sections/documents/view?version=56990574377821853810120416112724&amp;format=REVMAN_GRAPHS#REF-Harbord-2006">Harbord 2006</A>).

<DATA_SYNTHESIS MODIFIED="2016-11-10 18:15:41 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We carried out statistical analysis using Review Manager 5 software (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2014</LINK>). At the outset, we had anticipated that there would be some heterogeneity between studies in terms of the interventions and the populations studied, we therefore decided to use random-effects meta-analysis for combining data. Random-effects meta-analysis estimates the average treatment effect, and this may not always be clinically meaningful. Furthermore, where there is high heterogeneity the applicability of the overall effect estimate is likely to vary in different settings and we therefore advise caution in the interpretation of results. The random-effects summary was treated as the average of the range of possible treatment effects and we discuss the clinical implications of treatment effects differing between trials. If the average treatment effect was not clinically meaningful, we planned not to combine trials. Since we used random-effects analyses, the results were presented as the average treatment effect with 95% confidence intervals, and the estimates of Tau² and I².</P>

<P>This updated review is only focused on two primary outcomes each at two different time points. Of the 31 new studies included in this update, 21 studies provided data for one or more of the primary outcomes (see <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>). Ten new trials met the inclusion criteria for this review but were excluded from the analyses either because they did not present data in a useable form or because of attrition rates &gt;25%. Eleven studies provided data for outcome 1.1; 13 studies for outcome 1.2; eight studies for outcome 1.3; and eight studies for outcome 1.4. The addition of these studies to the studies included in the previous version of the review meant that for this 2016 update a total of 51 studies contributed data for outcome 1.1; 46 studies for outcome 1.2; 33 studies for outcome 1.3; and 32 studies for outcome 1.4.</P>

<P>In one of the studies of support from professionals and paraprofessionals, the professionals were lactation consultants (<LINK REF="STD-Kools-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Kools 2005</LINK>), and in the other they were midwives not stated to have had extra training in breastfeeding support (<LINK REF="STD-Morrell-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Morrell 2000</LINK>); in both these studies the para-professionals were trained to refer women with breastfeeding problems to the professionals. Two of the four studies of support from professionals and peers reported training; in <LINK REF="STD-Bhandari-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Bhandari 2003</LINK> peer supporters received WHO-based training, and in <LINK REF="STD-Hopkinson-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Hopkinson 2009</LINK> the professionals were IBCLCs and the peer supporters had three days' training in lactation management, 20 hours' training in peer counselling and at least one year&#8217;s work experience.

In the one study of breastfeeding in groups (<LINK REF="STD-Hoddinott-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Hoddinott 2009</LINK>), pregnant women and breastfeeding mothers could be invited to attend groups. The remaining 24 studies recruited women before the birth, not all of whom went on to initiate breastfeeding.

However, in the study by <LINK REF="STD-Yotebieng-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Yotebieng 2015</LINK>, the intervention was the Baby Friendly Hospital Initiative (BFHI) so the control group did not access this. For the other six studies undertaken in settings with Baby Friendly accreditation, study interventions were additional to care that met Baby Friendly standards and were received by everyone at the hospital including all the study participants in the intervention and control groups. In two community-based cluster-randomised trials (<LINK REF="STD-Hoddinott-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Hoddinott 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kronborg-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Kronborg 2007</LINK>), most of the maternity hospitals in which the participants had given birth had Baby Friendly accreditation.</P>
<P>In 29 studies control group care was not specified (n = 9) or stated to be standard care but not described (n = 20).

<P>In 66 of the 73 studies outcome data were collected from the women who had received the intervention. In the other seven studies, the relationship between the recipients of the intervention and the source of the outcome data varied. In the three individually-randomised trials of staff training (<LINK REF="STD-ISRCTN47056748" TYPE="STUDY">ISRCTN47056748</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Labarere-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Labarere 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Santiago-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Santiago 2003</LINK>), outcome data came from all the women randomised to receive, or not to receive, a support intervention from trained staff. In one of the three cluster-randomised trials of staff training (<LINK REF="STD-Ekstrom-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Ekstrom 2006</LINK>), data came from mothers of singleton term healthy infants at centres where staff had been randomised, or not randomised, to receive training. In another (<LINK REF="STD-Bhandari-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Bhandari 2003</LINK>), trained staff visited all families in the intervention villages and outcome data were collected from all infants in the intervention and control villages, and in the third (<LINK REF="STD-Kramer-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Kramer 2001</LINK>), staff in all intervention sites were trained and data were collected from mothers who intended to breastfeed in the intervention and control sites. In the cluster-randomised trial that evaluated a policy for providing breastfeeding groups (<LINK REF="STD-Hoddinott-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Hoddinott 2009</LINK>), the policy intervention was made at locality level.

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Duration of any and/or exclusive breastfeeding</HEADING>
<P>Breastfeeding duration was most commonly assessed at six months. A total of 51 studies measured any breastfeeding at six months and 46 studies measured exclusive breastfeeding at six months.

When data on both seven-day and 24-hour recall were provided, we selected the data for 24-hour recall.</P>
<P>The breastfeeding outcomes reported reflect World Bank country income group of the countries in which the 73 studies were undertaken. Most studies (29/52) reported the effect of the intervention on rates of both any and exclusive breastfeeding.

<P>The previous version of this review excluded 79 studies from the review and we have excluded a further 68 studies. Thus 147 studies have been excluded with reasons (see <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_EXCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of excluded studies</LINK>).

<P>Blinding participants and personnel: with interventions of this type, it is very difficult to assess risk of bias associated with blinding. Both the mothers and the staff providing care would probably be aware that they were either receiving or delivering an intervention. In studies where there was randomisation at the clinic level, all women may have been exposed to the same intervention, and contamination between groups would thereby be reduced, but there may still have been a risk of response bias if outcomes were reported to staff providing care. Therefore, we assessed no studies as being at a low risk of bias for this domain.</P>
<P>Blinding of outcome assessment: we assessed approximately one-quarter of studies as being at low risk of bias for blinding of outcome assessment: we deemed 27 studies to be at low risk, 27 studies to be at high risk, and 47 studies at unclear risk.</P>

<EXCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2017-01-04 12:08:45 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Alison McFadden">
<P>We had prespecified that we would not include data for any outcome where there were missing data for more than 25% of the randomised group. Loss to follow-up was a particular problem in studies where women were recruited in the antenatal period and, as we have described above, we have not included any outcome data from studies that were otherwise eligible for inclusion in the review because of high levels of attrition for all outcomes. For some of those studies that contributed data there was still considerable loss to follow-up, and loss was not always balanced across randomisation groups. When assessing incomplete outcome data, reasons for loss of data were not taken into consideration. </P>
<P>We judged approximately one-third of studies to be at low risk of bias for incomplete outcome data: we deemed 36 studies to be at low risk; 18 studies at high risk and 47 studies to be at unclear risk.</P>

<SELECTIVE_REPORTING MODIFIED="2017-01-04 12:08:11 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Alison McFadden">
<P>We assessed bias in most of the studies included in the review from published study reports. In most cases we did not have access to the trial registration or protocol. Under these circumstances assessing risk of bias due to selective reporting bias is very difficult. For this reason in the last version of this review all of the studies were deemed to be at unclear risk of bias for this domain. In this update we were able to access some protocols for newly included studies. Only 10 studies have been assessed as being at low risk of bias; five studies as high risk of bias and 86 studies as unclear. </P>

The quality of the studies was very mixed and most of the studies had some methodological weakness, or did not provide good information about methods. It is important that the mixed quality of the evidence is taken into account in the interpretation of results. We judged 28 studies to be at low risk of other potential sources of bias; six studies at high risk of bias and 67 studies at unclear risk. </P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Outcome 1.1: Stopping any breastfeeding up to six months postpartum</HEADING>
<P>The main summary outcome measure was cessation of any breastfeeding at the time of the last study assessment up to six months (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>).</P>
<P>In the meta-analysis for this outcome the previous version of this review we included 40 trials with 14,227 women (effective sample size). With the new studies we added in this update, there are now 51 studies with 21,418 women included. One new study (the BINGO trial, <LINK REF="STD-Bonuck-2014a" TYPE="STUDY">Bonuck 2014a</LINK>), contributes two intervention arms to the analysis and the control group was split to avoid double counting. One of the cluster-randomised trials (<LINK REF="STD-McLachlan-2016" TYPE="STUDY">McLachlan 2016</LINK>) also contributed two intervention arms and splitting over the control group was included in the adjustment for clustering.</P>
<P>Interventions to support breastfeeding appear to have a beneficial effect on the number of women who continue breastfeeding beyond six months, with fewer women in the groups that receive support stopping breastfeeding by this time (average risk ratio (RR) 0.91, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.88 to 0.95;<I> moderate-quality evidence</I>). Overall, 52.59% of those receiving support interventions had stopped any breastfeeding by six months compared with 56.64% of controls (unweighted percentages). However, there was high heterogeneity for this outcome and results should therefore be interpreted with caution (heterogeneity: Tau² = 0.01, I² = 55%, Chi² = 116.09, P &lt; 0.00001).</P>
<P>Sensitivity analysis using only studies assessed as having a low risk of bias for allocation concealment demonstrated a similar positive treatment effect on breastfeeding at up to six months (<LINK REF="CMP-001.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.5</LINK>). A sensitivity analysis omitting the cluster-randomised study (<LINK REF="STD-Elliott_x002d_Rudder-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Elliott-Rudder 2014</LINK>) for which a design effect could not be calculated demonstrated a similar positive treatment effect (average RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.88 to 0.94).</P>
<P>Visual inspection of the funnel plot generated for this outcome suggested that there was some asymmetry with results from smaller studies tending to show a greater positive treatment effect (<LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Outcome 1.2: Stopping exclusive breastfeeding up to six months postpartum</HEADING>
<P>In the previous version of this review we included 33 studies with 11,961 women in the analysis of women who had stopped exclusive breastfeeding at up to six months. With the new studies we added in this update, there are now 46 studies with 18,591 women included. Two new studies (the BINGO trial, <LINK REF="STD-Bonuck-2014a" TYPE="STUDY">Bonuck 2014a</LINK>;<LINK REF="STD-Yotebieng-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Yotebieng 2015</LINK>), contribute two intervention arms to the analysis; we split the control group to avoid double-counting.</P>
<P>Women in the intervention groups were less likely to have stopped exclusive breastfeeding before six months (average RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.85 to 0.92; <I>moderate-quality evidence</I>) (Heterogeneity: Tau² = 0.01, I² = 96%, Chi² = 1076.75, P&lt;0.00001; <LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>); although 74.9% of women in the intervention groups had stopped exclusive breastfeeding by this time, a greater proportion of women in the control groups had stopped (83.4%; unweighted percentages).</P>
<P>Sensitivity analysis using only those studies assessed as having a low risk of bias for allocation concealment revealed that results still significantly favoured the intervention groups (<LINK REF="CMP-001.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.6</LINK>), although the effect size was reduced in the studies at low risk of bias (average RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.89 to 0.96). A sensitivity analysis omitting the one arm of the cluster-randomised study (<LINK REF="STD-Yotebieng-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Yotebieng 2015</LINK>) for which a design effect could not be calculated demonstrated the same positive treatment effect (average RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.84 to 0.91).</P>
<P>Visual examination of a funnel plot for this outcome suggested that the treatment effect may have been more pronounced in smaller studies (<LINK REF="FIG-04" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 4</LINK>).</P>

There was considerable variation in the results from individual studies (heterogeneity: Tau² = 0.02, I² = 54%, Chi² = 74.65, P = 0.0001; <LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>).</P>
<P>Sensitivity analysis using only those studies assessed as having a low risk of bias for allocation concealment revealed that results still significantly favoured the intervention groups (<LINK REF="CMP-001.07" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.7</LINK>), although the effect size was reduced in the studies at low risk of bias (average RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.81 to 0.96).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Outcome 1.4: Stopping exclusive breastfeeding before four to six weeks postpartum</HEADING>
<P>In the previous version of this review, we included 24 studies with 7693 women in the analysis of women who had stopped exclusive breastfeeding before four to six weeks. With the new studies we added in this update, there are now 32 studies with 10,960 women included. Two new studies (the BINGO trial, <LINK REF="STD-Bonuck-2014a" TYPE="STUDY">Bonuck 2014a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fu-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Fu 2014</LINK>), contribute two intervention arms to the analysis, and we have split the controls to avoid double-counting.</P>
<P>Women in the intervention groups were less likely to stop exclusive breastfeeding by six weeks compared with women in the control groups (average RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.71 to 0.89; <I>moderate-quality evidence</I>); and while 57.2% of women in the intervention groups had stopped exclusive breastfeeding by this time, 65.0% of women in control groups had also stopped (unweighted percentages); (heterogeneity: Tau² = 0.10, I² = 97%, Chi² = 1160.22, P &lt; 0.00001; <LINK REF="CMP-001.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.4</LINK>).</P>
<P>Again, there was some evidence that the treatment effect may be partly due to bias; sensitivity analysis including only those studies assessed as being at low risk of bias for allocation concealment showed that results still favoured the intervention group although the treatment effect was less pronounced in the studies at lower risk of bias (<LINK REF="CMP-001.08" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.8</LINK>). A sensitivity analysis omitting the cluster-randomised study (<LINK REF="STD-Ochola-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Ochola 2013</LINK>) for which a design effect could not be calculated demonstrated a similar positive treatment effect (average RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.71 to 0.89).</P>
<P>Visual examination of the funnel plot for this outcome suggested that the treatment effect may have been more pronounced in smaller studies and that there may be smaller studies missing which do not find an effect in favour of the intervention (<LINK REF="FIG-06" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 6</LINK>).</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Secondary outcomes</HEADING>
<P>This update of the review does not include an analysis of secondary outcomes.</P>
<P>Secondary outcomes were not considered in this update so that the review could be completed in time to inform the World Health Organisation&#8217;s review of the evidence and update of the WHO recommendations on breastfeeding in maternity facilities. A new set of core outcomes for Cochrane pregnancy and childbirth breastfeeding reviews is currently being developed and the outcomes from this core set may influence future outcomes chosen for this review.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Subgroup analysis</HEADING>
<P>There was considerable variation between the trials in terms of the interventions examined, the standard care offered to women, and the background breastfeeding initiation rates in the various study settings. We wanted to explore whether different types of support and settings were associated with different or more pronounced treatment effects. Therefore, for the review's four primary outcomes we carried out subgroup analysis to explore the impact of interventions involving different types of supporter (professional versus lay person, or both); types of support (face-to-face versus telephone support or both); timing of support (antenatal and postnatal versus postnatal alone); whether the support was proactive (scheduled contacts) or reactive (women needed to request support); and whether support interventions had similar effects in settings with different background breastfeeding initiation rates (low, medium or high background rates).</P>
<P>For all subgroup analyses, the covariate chosen does little to explain the high heterogeneity; most within-group heterogeneity remains high.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Who delivered the support</HEADING>
<P>For our four primary outcomes, we examined whether the treatment effect was similar where the support was delivered by professionals as opposed to non-professionals (lay support) or both. It should be noted that most studies involved delivery of the intervention by professionals (37 of the 51 studies).</P>
<P>For cessation of any breastfeeding at up to six months it appeared that support from non-professionals was associated with a broadly similar treatment effect to that for support from professionals (<LINK REF="CMP-002.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.1</LINK>).</P>
<P>The test for subgroup differences suggests a differential treatment effect according to who delivers the support, but we are not confident in this result due to very different subgroup sizes and high within-group heterogeneity in two of three groups and zero heterogeneity in the other (test for subgroup differences: Chi² = 6.02, degrees of freedom (df) = 2 (P = 0.05), I² = 66.8%). When the smaller, mixed support group is removed from the analysis, there is no evidence of a difference between lay and professional support (test for subgroup differences: Chi² = 2.89, df = 1 (P = 0.09), I² = 65.4%).</P>
<P>For cessation of exclusive breastfeeding at up to six months the treatment effect appears to be greater when the intervention was delivered by non-professionals (lay support) compared with professionals or mixed support (test for subgroup differences: Chi² = 7.74, df = 2 (P = 0.02), I² = 73.1%; <LINK REF="CMP-002.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.2</LINK>). The confidence intervals for professional and lay support do not overlap, but due to the high heterogeneity remaining within the subgroups, we advise caution when interpreting this result.</P>
<P>For cessation of any breastfeeding by four to six weeks there is no evidence for a differential effect when professionals, lay or both deliver support (test for subgroup differences: Chi² = 1.47, df = 2 (P = 0.48), I² = 0%; <LINK REF="CMP-002.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.3</LINK>).</P>
<P>For cessation of exclusive breastfeeding by four to six weeks the test for subgroup differences indicates a possible differential treatment effect (test for subgroup differences: Chi² = 7.12, df = 2 (P = 0.03), I² = 71.9%). However, we are not confident in this result, because the mixed subgroup is disproportionately small. When this third group is removed from the analysis there is no evidence for a differential effect between professional and lay support test for subgroup differences: Chi² = 2.31, df = 1 (P = 0.13), I² = 56.7%; <LINK REF="CMP-002.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.4</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Type of support</HEADING>
<P>We compared different types of intervention (support provided predominantly by face-to-face contact, predominantly by telephone, or by both face-to-face and telephone contact) for our primary outcomes.</P>
<P>For cessation of any breastfeeding at up to six months there was no evidence of a differential effect according to type of support (test for subgroup differences: Chi² = 0.40, df = 2 (P = 0.82), I² = 0%; <LINK REF="CMP-003.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.1</LINK>).</P>
<P>For cessation of exclusive breastfeeding at up to six months face-to-face interventions may be associated with greater effects than other types of support; however, very high within-group heterogeneity remains in the analysis, and we advise caution when interpreting this result (test for subgroup differences: Chi² = 37.55, df = 2 (P&lt;.00001, I² = 94.7%; <LINK REF="CMP-003.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.2</LINK>).</P>
<P>For cessation of any breastfeeding by four to six weeks, there is no evidence of a differential effect according to type of support (test for subgroup differences: Chi² = 0.91, df = 2 (P = 0.64), I² = 0%; <LINK REF="CMP-003.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.3</LINK>).</P>
<P>For cessation of exclusive breastfeeding at up to four to six weeks, face-to-face interventions may be associated with greater effects than other types of support; however very high within-group heterogeneity remains in the analyses, and we advise caution when interpreting this result (test for subgroup differences: Chi² = 10.63, df = 2 (P = 0.005), I² = 81.2%; <LINK REF="CMP-003.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.4</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">When the support was offered</HEADING>
<P>We examined whether offering support with an antenatal component rather than postnatal support alone was associated with any difference in treatment effect. The results were similar in both subgroups for all of our four primary outcomes and there were no significant subgroup differences according to the interaction tests (<LINK REF="CMP-004.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.1</LINK> test for subgroup differences: test for subgroup differences: Chi² = 0.15, df = 1 (P = 0.70), I² = 0%); (<LINK REF="CMP-004.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.2</LINK> test for subgroup differences: Chi² = 1.54, df = 1 (P = 0.21), I² = 35.1%); (<LINK REF="CMP-004.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.3</LINK> test for subgroup differences: Chi² = 1.05, df = 1 (P = 0.31), I² = 4.4%); (<LINK REF="CMP-004.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.4</LINK> test for subgroup differences: Chi² = 2.07, df = 1 (P = 0.15), I² = 51.6%).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Proactive versus reactive support</HEADING>
<P>We had planned to carry out formal subgroup analysis by whether support was proactive or reactive, but due to the fact that most interventions included at least one scheduled contact (proactive), we did not think that this way of categorising studies would shed light on types of interventions that were effective or ineffective.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Background breastfeeding initiation rates in study settings</HEADING>
<P>We were interested in whether or not background rates of breastfeeding in different settings had any impact on the success of interventions. We divided the studies into three groups: those carried out in settings where 80% or more women initiated breastfeeding (high background initiation), where between 60% to 80% initiated breastfeeding (intermediate) or where breastfeeding initiation rates were less than 60% (low). These groups showed an inverse relationship with World Bank country income groups. The studies with high background rates of breastfeeding initiation were set in countries from all the World Bank country income groups, however, the four studies from low-/low-middle income countries had the highest rates (more than 95%). All the studies with intermediate or low background rates of breastfeeding initiation were undertaken in high-income countries.</P>
<P>We found the interventions had a greater effect of preventing women stopping exclusive breastfeeding at both time points in countries where background rates were already high; there was no similar effect on any breastfeeding. Because within-group heterogeneity remains high in all analyses, we advise caution when interpreting this result.</P>
<P>For cessation of any breastfeeding at up to six months, there is no evidence of a difference in the effectiveness of the intervention according to the background breastfeeding rate (test for subgroup differences: Chi² = 0.56, df = 2 (P = 0.76), I² = 0%; <LINK REF="CMP-005.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 5.1</LINK>).</P>
<P>For cessation of exclusive breastfeeding at up to six months, the intervention effect appears greater in studies where breastfeeding initiation rates were high (test for subgroup differences: Chi² = 30.73, df = 2 (P &lt;.00001, I² = 93.5%; <LINK REF="CMP-005.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 5.2</LINK>). However, within-group heterogeneity remains very high, and we advise caution when interpreting this result.</P>
<P>For cessation of any breastfeeding by four to six weeks, there is no evidence that the interventions worked differently in trials with different background rates of breastfeeding (test for subgroup differences: Chi² = 2.72, df = 2 (P = 0.26), I² = 26.6%; <LINK REF="CMP-005.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 5.3</LINK>).</P>
<P>For cessation of exclusive breastfeeding at up to four to six weeks, the intervention effect appears stronger in studies where initiation rates were high (test for subgroup differences: Chi² = 9.24, df = 2 (P = 0.010), I² = 78.4% <LINK REF="CMP-005.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 5.4</LINK>). However, within-group heterogeneity remains very high in all subgroups, and we advise caution when interpreting this result.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Intensity of the intervention: the number of postnatal contacts</HEADING>
<P>We examined whether different numbers of postnatal contacts were associated with any difference in treatment effect. We divided the studies into four subgroups: unspecified or no direct contacts (for example in studies that involved staff training rather than direct contacts with women); less than four postnatal contacts; between four and eight contacts; and more than eight contacts. Trials including antenatal contacts are included here, and we used the number of postnatal contacts to determine the appropriate subgroup.</P>
<P>For cessation of any breastfeeding at the final study assessment up to six months, there was no evidence of subgroup differences (test for subgroup differences: Chi² = 1.45, df = 3 (P = 0.69, I² = 0%; <LINK REF="CMP-006.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 6.1</LINK>).</P>
<P>For cessation of exclusive breastfeeding at up to six months, there appears to be a differential effect of the number of postnatal contacts, with four to eight contacts performing best. The confidence intervals for this subgroup do not overlap with any other subgroup, but within-group heterogeneity for all subgroups remains very high, and we advise caution when interpreting this result (<LINK REF="CMP-006.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 6.2</LINK>; test for subgroup differences: Chi² = 13.78, df = 3 (P = 0.003), I² = 78.2%).</P>
<P>For cessation of any breastfeeding by four to six weeks, there was no evidence of a differential treatment effect according to the number of postnatal contacts (test for subgroup differences: Chi² = 1.59, df = 3 (P = 0.66), I² = 0%; <LINK REF="CMP-006.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 6.3</LINK>).</P>
<P>For cessation of exclusive breastfeeding at up to four to six weeks there appears to be differential treatment effect according to the number of support contacts, with four to eight contacts the most effective schedule. However, within-group heterogeneity remains very high in all subgroups, and we advise caution when interpreting this result (test for subgroup differences: Chi² = 7.62, df = 3 (P = 0.05), I² = 60.6%; <LINK REF="CMP-006.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 6.4</LINK>).<BR/>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-01-20 13:20:04 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This update of the review considered the evidence of the effect of breastfeeding support interventions on primary outcomes of stopping any or exclusive breastfeeding before four to six weeks and at up to six months postpartum. The review includes 100 trials published from 1979 to 2016, 73 of which contributed data to the analyses. The 73 trials that contributed data to the analyses were conducted in 29 countries; 52 studies (62.1% of participants) in high-income countries, 15 (30.1% of participants) in upper-middle income countries, four (3.4% of participants) in lower-middle income countries, and four (4.4% of participants) in low-income countries. The numbers of trials include one (<LINK REF="STD-Tylleskar-2011a" TYPE="STUDY">Tylleskar 2011a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tylleskar-2011b" TYPE="STUDY">Tylleskar 2011b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tylleskar-2011c" TYPE="STUDY">Tylleskar 2011c</LINK>) that was conducted in three countries; two low-income and one upper-middle income countries. This number and location of trials indicates that the challenge of supporting women to breastfeed is both longstanding and international; this is also reflected in the continuing low rates of duration and exclusivity of breastfeeding in many countries, despite increasing availability of good-quality evidence of the scale of its public health impact.</P>
<P>This updated review provides evidence that interventions to support breastfeeding appear to reduce the risk of women stopping any breastfeeding at up to six months and exclusive breastfeeding at up to six months. Similarly the review provides evidence that women receiving breastfeeding support interventions were less likely to stop any breastfeeding before six weeks and exclusive breastfeeding at up to four to six weeks. The size of the treatment effects varied considerably in different trials, and average treatment effects may not be applicable in different settings. The subgroup analyses suggested that face-to-face support was associated with a greater treatment effect for exclusive breastfeeding than either telephone support alone or mixed telephone and face-to-face support. Similarly, support interventions were associated with greater effect on exclusive breastfeeding in settings with high background breastfeeding initiation rates compared to settings with low or intermediate breastfeeding initiation rates. Lay support and more contact in the form of scheduled visits (4 to 8 visits) were also associated with greater treatment effects.  However, for all of these subgroup results, the within-group heterogeneity remains high, and we advise caution when interpreting these results.</P>
<P>A striking aspect of this updated review is the heterogeneity of the support interventions, and the diversity of settings and of standard care. Interventions deemed by researchers to be &#8216;supportive&#8217; included some where it was difficult to see how women might actually feel supported, especially when the support service provided was one they had to ask for, or travel a distance to get to (<LINK REF="STD-Graffy-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Graffy 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hoddinott-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Hoddinott 2009</LINK>), or where there was only one scheduled contact with the support person. However, this updated review, like the previous update (<LINK REF="REF-Renfrew-2012b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Renfrew 2012b</LINK>), has shown that the effect of supportive interventions is robust across settings and population groups, and results from a wide range of interventions. </P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2017-01-20 13:20:39 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review adds 21 trials contributing data to its evidence base compared to its predecessors (<LINK REF="REF-Britton-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Britton 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Renfrew-2012b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Renfrew 2012b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sikorski-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sikorski 2002</LINK>). The number of mother-infant pairs in these studies has increased to 74,656 from 56,451 in <LINK REF="REF-Renfrew-2012b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Renfrew 2012b</LINK>. The reporting of the included studies was, however, often not comprehensive - lacking, for example, in terms of a description of the components of the support intervention, details of the training and qualifications of the supporters, the definitions used of the extent of breastfeeding and in the description of adherence to the support protocol. There was also a failure to present details of the interventions and of the standard care available to both intervention and comparison groups. Very few of the trials described a theoretical basis for the intervention tested, with the result that the findings are difficult to explain or to replicate. There has been slight improvement in study reporting or quality, with 44 out of the 73 trials that contributed data (60%) reporting an approach to allocation concealment that we considered to be at low risk of bias compared to 26 of the 52 trials (50%) in the previous review (<LINK REF="REF-Renfrew-2012b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Renfrew 2012b</LINK>).</P>
<P>It is possible that not all existing trials have been included in this meta-analysis. Funnel plot analyses conducted for the primary outcomes all show marked asymmetry, with each suggesting that smaller studies showing a less beneficial effect of the intervention may be missing. This may be the result of publication bias although it is also possible that few or no such trials exist. Nevertheless, caution should be taken when interpreting the evidence as funnel plot asymmetry can also be the result of heterogeneity.</P>
<P>Interventions offered across all included studies were very diverse, as was the provision of standard care. Interventions included, for example, one individual session in hospital, offering women the opportunity to attend a group session in community settings, telephone support, and multiple one-to-one visits at home over several months. Five studies offered the intervention in the context of Baby Friendly accreditation of the hospital, and are unlikely to be generalisable to settings where this standard of care is not available to all women.</P>
<P>Study endpoints also varied widely, with some substantial gaps of many months between the completion of the intervention and the last study outcome assessed. Many only offered support in the early days or weeks. These factors, together with the range of different settings and population subgroups studied, should urge caution in the interpretation of the analysis of pooled data.</P>
<P>Despite this caution, the overall benefit identified from all forms of support interventions has been explored with subgroup and sensitivity analyses and is moderately robust following exclusion of the methodologically weaker trials. In this review, the greatest effect of breastfeeding support interventions on reducing cessation of exclusive breastfeeding before six months occurred in communities with high (over 80%) levels of breastfeeding initiation. This suggests that work to promote breastfeeding at a population level should continue as one strategy to increase breastfeeding duration and exclusivity (<LINK REF="REF-Dyson-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dyson 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rollins-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rollins 2016</LINK>).</P>
<P>While the effect size of support interventions on reducing the cessation of any breastfeeding is modest, there is evidence of a greater effect on the prolongation of exclusive breastfeeding. There was a reduction in the cessation of exclusive breastfeeding within the first six months and at up to four to six weeks when lay support was used, although in view of considerable within-subgroup heterogeneity, these findings should be interpreted with caution.</P>
<P>We have explored a range of possible reasons to explain the significant heterogeneity in the findings. As noted above, included studies were very varied in setting, population group studied, content, timing and intensity of the intervention, whether it was proactively offered to women or available only if they asked for it, the standard care available, staff training programmes, and the type and timing of the outcomes measured.</P>
<P>Strategies that depend mainly on face-to-face support appear more effective than those that rely primarily on telephone contact for women who practice exclusive breastfeeding. The duration of the intervention also seems to be an important factor for exclusive breastfeeding. Interventions that relied on one session in hospital are very different from interventions where women receive repeated home visits. We attempted to examine this by assessing the intensity of the intervention, and we found studies with four to eight visits to be associated with a more pronounced treatment effect on exclusive breastfeeding at final study assessment. However there was some evidence that more pronounced treatment effects were associated with studies at higher risk of bias; this could potentially confound any differences between subgroups. Caution is also needed in the interpretation of this finding as there is inconsistent reporting due to variations in the timing of outcome assessments, and the settings of studies and the population groups included in studies with more face-to-face visits. There was no evidence found for a difference between solely postnatal interventions and those interventions with both an antenatal and postnatal component.</P>
<P>It is likely that support will be most effective when it reflects the local needs of the population. It was notable that none of the five studies where women were expected to access support without any proactive element found a difference in outcomes between control and intervention groups. Four of these five were UK-based studies, which may help to explain the lack of effect seen in recent UK trials (<LINK REF="REF-Hoddinott-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hoddinott 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>The findings of the subgroup analysis that suggests that interventions with four to eight contacts are best compared to those with either fewer contacts or nine or more contacts seems counter-intuitive. Given the heterogeneity of the somewhat complex interventions being tested, however, we might assume that it is other aspects of the interventions that may be responsible. One of the ways to test this would be to conduct meta-regression of the effects of the number of contacts; thus ensuring that the exact number of contacts is used for each study rather than the categorization we have used. This is something we will explore in a future update of this review. We will also consider, in a future update, adopting an analysis strategy which would treat the outcomes as time-to-event data (i.e. 'time to breastfeeding cessation' and 'time to cessation of exclusive breastfeeding'). However, whilst some studies do provide such data, many currently do not.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2017-02-02 11:38:34 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We considered that the overall risk of bias of trials included in the review was mixed. We graded fewer than half of the studies (44/100) as being at low risk of bias for allocation concealment. However, when we carried out sensitivity analysis which included only those studies at low risk of bias for allocation concealment, the results were not substantially different. A potentially important source of bias in these studies was the general lack of blinding. However, given the nature of the intervention it is unlikely that participants or personnel, or both, would be blinded, as for the support interventions, trialists would face considerable difficulties in blinding staff and women. We graded blinding of outcome assessment as being at low risk in about a quarter of studies. However, even where an attempt is made to blind outcome assessment, there is still a risk of response bias for outcomes relying on self-report such as any or exclusive breastfeeding. A further possible source of bias was loss to follow-up and missing outcome data. In the 17 studies with an attrition of more than 25%, the reasons for attrition were unclear, and these studies did not contribute data to the review. However, we are aware that even lower levels of attrition are problematic, particularly where loss was not balanced across different arms of trials. To avoid problems associated with attrition, we carried out intention-to-treat analysis for our primary outcomes; that is, we assumed that all women who were lost to follow-up had stopped breastfeeding by given time points. This is likely to have diluted overall treatment effects but these estimates may be more appropriate given the possibility of response bias and the increased likelihood of women who stopped breastfeeding dropping out before those who continued.</P>
<P>We assessed the four primary outcomes with GRADE criteria. We did not downgrade any evidence for lack of blinding during this assessment; neither did we downgrade trials for other risk of bias domains (our sensitivity analyses were robust, as reported above). We judged all outcomes to be of moderate quality - stopping 'any' breastfeeding at up to six months; 'any' breastfeeding between four to six weeks; stopping exclusive breastfeeding at up to six months; or stopping exclusive breastfeeding between four to six weeks; all analyses had substantial heterogeneity even with a random-effects model. An assessment of moderate quality highlights our uncertainty in the summary estimate presented here. Included trials of breastfeeding support had mixed results for preventing women from stopping exclusive breastfeeding.</P>
<P>In meta-analyses with a large number of trials, as is the case in this review, there is a strong possibility that a large number of small and possibly poor quality trials will have a substantial influence on the result. In such circumstances it is preferable, therefore, to conduct a sensitivity analysis confined to the trials of the best methodological quality, which would be assumed to be the most reliable and unbiased. Apart from allocation concealment, we have not performed such an analysis, since none of the studies were assessed as being low risk of bias across all of the domains of bias we assessed.</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2017-02-02 11:48:57 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is a potential for bias to be introduced at any stage of the review process. In order to minimise the bias in the review process, two review authors independently screened studies for inclusion and any disagreements were resolved by a third review author. Data extraction and risk of bias assessment was performed by one reviewer and then checked by a second review author. Again any discrepancies were resolved by a third review author. It must be stressed that 'Risk of bias' assessment is subjective in nature and therefore another team of review authors may have graded studies differently. It is also worth noting that we did not formerly assess risk of bias in the 15 included cluster-randomized trials. Particular biases are unique to cluster designs, as described in the <I>Handbook </I>[section16.3.2] and formal assessments will be made of these in future updates. To minimise language bias any study not reported in English was translated into English and included in the review provided it met the inclusion criteria. This update was limited to primary outcomes so that it could be completed in time to inform important international guidance on infant feeding. All primary and secondary outcomes will be considered in the next update of this review. The development of a core outcome set for breastfeeding reviews is currently underway and this may influence the choice of outcomes in subsequent updates. This update, consistent with the previous versions of the review, combined different levels of interventions, so that trials in which breastfeeding mothers received the intervention were combined with trials where the intervention was directed at the staff providing the support. We will reconsider this approach in the next update. It is also of concern that there was missing data for 28 studies. Whilst we attempted to identify all the evidence on interventions to support breastfeeding (including published abstracts from conference proceedings) and followed-up ongoing studies, it is feasible that relevant research that is unpublished or not registered in a clinical trials register could have been missed.</P>

<P>The overall findings of this review, that breastfeeding support interventions have been shown to be effective in reducing the risk of cessation of any breastfeeding and of exclusive breastfeeding, are similar to the findings of other reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Rollins-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rollins 2016</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sinha-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sinha 2015</LINK>). We concur with others, e.g. <LINK REF="REF-Hoddinott-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hoddinott 2011</LINK> and <LINK REF="REF-Renfrew-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Renfrew 2007</LINK>, that it is critically important to identify the characteristics of support that may make this important but heterogenous intervention more or less effective in different circumstances and settings. For example, <LINK REF="REF-Jolly-2012b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jolly 2012b</LINK> found that peer support had a greater effect on reducing the risk of non-exclusive breastfeeding in low- and middle-income countries compared to high-income countries, especially in the UK. Other recent reviews have found that interventions to increase breastfeeding duration and exclusivity are more effective when delivered as multi-component structured programmes such as the Baby Friendly Hosptial Initiative/Baby Friendly Initiative (BFHI/BFI), in a combination of settings (<LINK REF="REF-Beake-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beake 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-P_x00e9_rez_x2010_Escamilla-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pérez&#8208;Escamilla 2016</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rollins-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rollins 2016</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sinha-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sinha 2015</LINK>).</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2017-01-05 12:19:44 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Alison McFadden">
<P>When breastfeeding support is offered to women, the duration and exclusivity of breastfeeding is increased. Characteristics of effective support include: that it is offered as standard by trained personnel during antenatal or postnatal care, that it includes ongoing scheduled visits so that women can predict when support will be available, and that it is tailored to the setting and the needs of the population group. Support is likely to be more effective in settings with high initiation rates. Support may be offered either by professional or lay/peer supporters, or a combination of both. Strategies that rely mainly on face-to-face support are more likely to succeed with women practising exclusive breastfeeding.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2017-01-04 12:24:21 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Alison McFadden">
<P>There is a very large number of trials in this field and this number continues to grow. This has resulted in a great deal of research time, energy and funding. While there are still questions to address about how best to provide support, the key messages are clear &#8211; we have ample evidence to know that women need support to be available and to be provided using the characteristics we have identified to increase the duration and exclusivity of breastfeeding. The key research question for the future is to identify how such support can best be provided consistently, for all women, in all countries. This becomes a scaling-up issue, which needs implementation and quality improvement approaches rather than effectiveness studies.</P>
<P>Any future studies should describe in detail the attributes of the intervention (who delivered it, setting, intensity, proactive or reactive); standard care (Baby Friendly accreditation or not, staff trained in breastfeeding or not); the population group studied (low- versus high-income, any selection criteria); and the background breastfeeding rates in the population studies. Studies should also examine the potential for synergy between support and other interventions that aim to increase breastfeeding rates, as it may be that a package of interventions is more effective than single interventions in tackling the multifaceted challenge of increasing breastfeeding rates. Packages to be tested could include peer and professional support along with, for example, antenatal education, staff training, and mother-to-mother support. Studies should also assess the effectiveness of lay, professional and combined support in different settings - in particular in those communities with low rates of breastfeeding initiation. Implementation of the Baby Friendly Initiative should be accompanied by the continued monitoring of breastfeeding rates to explore whether its effect is similar in countries with differing rates of initiation and prevalence of breastfeeding.</P>
<P>Further study is also required to:</P>
<UL>
<LI>test the effectiveness of different training programmes (which should be well-defined and reproducible) and should attempt to address impact on both exclusive and any breastfeeding where possible;</LI>
<LI>analyse and develop the theoretical basis for their approach, and analyse the elements of their approach that appear to have an impact, including training, timing, and intensity of the intervention, and differential impact on different population subgroups;</LI>
<LI>establish the cost-effectiveness of different interventions;</LI>
<LI>investigate appropriate strategies for supporting women who wish to breastfeed for longer than six months;</LI>

<P>In the original protocol, (1998), Odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were specified as being the measure of treatment effect. However, in the first published version of the review, <LINK REF="REF-Sikorski-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sikorski 1999</LINK>, and in all subsequent versions of the review, Risk Ratios (RRs) with 95% CIs have been presented. In the original protocol, the subgroups specified for investigation of heterogeneity were reported as being income group and both ante- and post-natal time periods. Income group was removed from subsequent versions and with the addition of many more studies, the following subgroups have been incorporated:</P>
<OL>
<LI>By type of supporter (professional versus lay person, or both).</LI>
<LI>By type of support (face-to-face versus telephone support).</LI>
<LI>By timing of support (antenatal and postnatal versus postnatal alone) - in original protocol.</LI>
<LI>By whether the support was proactive (scheduled contacts) or reactive (women needed to request support).</LI>
<LI>By background breastfeeding initiation rates (low, medium or high background rates).</LI>
<LI>By intensity of support (number of scheduled contacts.</LI>
</OL>
<P>No sensitivity analyses were specified in the original protocol, 1998. In subsequent versions of the review and in the current update, sensitivity analyses looking at the effect of allocation concealment by comparing results from studies at low risk of bias as opposed to unclear or high risk of bias were incorporated.</P>
<P>The methods section has been updated to the current standard methods for Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth reviews and the review now focuses on healthy mothers with healthy term infants. A 'Summary of findings' table has been incorporated for this 2016 update.</P>
<P>In this update, 2016, we have not included data for the following secondary outcomes. Primary outcomes were recorded for stopping any or exclusive breastfeeding before four to six weeks and before six months postpartum. Other outcomes of interest in previous versions of this review were stopping any or exclusive breastfeeding at other time points (two, three, four, nine and 12 months), measures of neonatal and infant morbidity (where available) and measures of maternal satisfaction with care or feeding method. Secondary outcomes were not considered in this update so that the review could be completed in time to inform the World Health Organisation&#8217;s review of the evidence and update of the WHO recommendations on breastfeeding in maternity facilities. A new set of core outcomes for Cochrane pregnancy and childbirth breastfeeding reviews is currently being developed and the outcomes from this core set may influence future outcomes chosen for this review.</P>
<P>Secondary outcomes included in last update, 2012:</P>
<OL>
<LI>Stopping breastfeeding before two, three, nine and 12 months postpartum.</LI>
<LI>Stopping exclusive breastfeeding before two, three, nine and 12 months postpartum.</LI>
<LI>Maternal satisfaction with care.</LI>
<LI>Maternal satisfaction with feeding method.</LI>
<LI>All-cause infant or neonatal morbidity.</LI>
</OL>
<P>In this update, 2016, "healthy" in terms of types of participants has been more clearly defined: "Participants were healthy pregnant women considering or intending to breastfeed or healthy women who were breastfeeding healthy babies.Healthy women and babies were considered those who did not require additional medical care (e.g. women with diabetes, women with HIV/AIDs, overweight or obese women) or surgical care (e.g. women who required a Caesarean Section). Studies which focused specifically on women with additional care needs were excluded."</P>

Most of the results were not reported according to randomisation group (rather authors described factors and associations with, e.g. breastfeeding). Breastfeeding in the randomized groups at 6 weeks was not reported and it was not possible to contact the authors to obtain this information. It was stated that average breastfeeding duration was 28.6 days in the intervention group vs 21.0 days for controls, but no SDs were reported. It was not clear when or how breastfeeding duration data were collected; if at the 6-week postpartum interviews this suggests that figures for average breastfeeding duration only apply to those women who had discontinued breastfeeding and denominators are therefore not clear.</P>

<P>Intervention (n = 188): delivered by a trained LC. Women were recruited when &lt; 24 weeks pregnant, and had 2 prenatal LC visits scheduled. During late pregnancy there was telephone contact, and hospital and home visits and telephone support (up to 12 months postpartum) were planned for the postnatal period.

<P>Infant health outcomes:</P>
<P>Duration of breastfeeding and exclusive breastfeeding was presented mostly in graphical form and was difficult to interpret. Breastfeeding was categorised on a 7-point scale from 7 = exclusive breastfeeding (which was defined as no other milk or food, but infants may have received water and other liquids) through to exclusive formula, between these extremes of the scale there were various 'intensities' of breastfeeding (e.g. &gt; 50% breast milk). This meant that results were complicated and not easy to interpret. Women were followed up for up to 12 months and detailed (graphical) weekly data were reported for weeks 1-26 postpartum.</P>

<P>Counseling took place through 10 home visits: one in the first 10 days after birth, monthly up to 6 months and then at 8, 10 and 12 months. The dietary recommendations that the mothers were given prioritised exclusive breastfeeding up to 6 months and introduction of complementary foods at the age of 6 months. Mothers were advised not to give their children bottles or pacifiers. 12 undergraduate students of nutrition conducted the home visits in pairs. The entire team was trained in the dietary guidelines and in techniques for counselling mothers about the Ten Steps for Healthy Feeding of Children Younger Than Two Years. Each dietary counselling session lasted 30 min-40 min.</P>

Prenatal visits involved assessment of previous breastfeeding experiences/knowledge, personalised education about breastfeeding logistics, the risks of formula feeding, and anticipatory guidance. During hospitalisation, women received 1 SBFPC visit per day, which were similar in content to those provided by 'Breastfeeding: Heritage and Pride' (BHP) peer counsellors. The SBFPC ensured that intervention participants received a manual breast pump before discharge.</P>
<P>Control: standard breastfeeding support and staff peer counsellors (see below), which involved routine access to breastfeeding support from hospital personnel, including staff peer counsellors, plus prenatal breastfeeding education that included brief breastfeeding discussions during routine clinic appointments and receipt of written educational materials. Staff nurses provided routine perinatal breastfeeding assistance, with LCs available as needed. After discharge, participants could call the hospital telephone hotline with breastfeeding questions.</P>
<P>Standard care also included optional breastfeeding support from Breastfeeding: Heritage and Pride (BHP) peer counsellors (PC), who provided the following: up to 3 prenatal visits (covering breastfeeding benefits, breastfeeding myths, positioning, and common breastfeeding problems and to educate with up to 7 personalised home visits during the first year postpartum; and telephone support. If available, electric breast pumps were loaned as needed. To receive prenatal PC visits, controls could self-refer or be referred to the BHP program.</P>

Labour took place in a comprehensive room with constant care, with early skin-to-skin contact of at least 1 h and encouragement of early initiation of breastfeeding (positive covariates for EBF). During the immediate postpartum period personalised educational support was delivered by the healthcare team. Early discharge with comprehensive intervention (after 24 h) was complemented by a home visit (after 48 h) where the mother's and baby&#8217;s care was reinforced, as well as the breastfeeding technique in a family setting.</P>
<P>Control (n = 386): 'traditional care', i.e. standard care from the public health system. This involved labour management interventions (negative covariates for EBF) with intermittent and passive family participation. Early skin-to-skin contact was performed without any standardised guidelines and mother and child room-sharing began once the newborn had received immediate care.

<P>Intervention (n = 237): the VoorZorg programme - a home visitation programme translated and culturally adapted from the Nurse Family Partnership (NFP) programme. In addition to usual care, women received approximately 10 home visits during pregnancy, 20 during the first life year of the child and 20 during the second by trained, specialised VoorZorg nurses. 6 domains were discussed during the home visits: 1) the health status of the mother, 2) the child's health and safety, 3) the personal development of the mother, 4) the role of the mother, 5) the mother's relation with her partner, family and friends, and 6) the use of (health) care organizations. During pregnancy, women receiving the VoorZorg intervention were encouraged to initiate and continue breastfeeding after childbirth. The VoorZorg nurse also discussed the problems women encountered when breastfeeding their child and worked together with the mother to seek solutions to continue breastfeeding. The VoorZorg nurses also aimed to reduce smoking with the V-MIS smoking cessation programme.</P>
<P>Control (n = 223): usual care provided by the Dutch Youth Health Care Organizations.

<P>Intervention 1 (n = 363): Baby Friendly Hospital Intiative (BFHI) steps 1-9; healthcare staff from antenatal and maternity care (i.e. delivery rooms and postpartum wards) in the intervention facilities were trained using the WHO/UNICEF course. Session 14 of the training on 'Ongoing support for mothers' was limited only to 'Describe how to prepare a mother for discharge'. Session 15 on 'Making your hospital baby friendly' was not covered. Additional material in French developed as part of a different project was distributed to staff in clinics. Implementation of steps 1&#8211;9 was assessed at the end of the study using the hospital self-appraisal questionnaire and each of the clinics randomized to intervention groups met at least 80% of the global criteria for each step.</P>
<P>Intervention 2 (n = 308): BFHI steps 1-10; staff training as for Intervention 1 and staff from well-child clinics also received the same training. Flyers distributed to mothers before discharge from the postpartum ward and during well-child clinic visits. These were developed locally and contained culturally appropriate messages addressing behaviours that had been identified as the main contributors to suboptimum breastfeeding practices (such as giving the baby water in the first 6 months of life) in a pretrial survey. These were published in 2 languages (French and local language).

<P>Intervention not relevant for this review. The intervention was an alternative to standard care. The intervention was not aimed at facilitating breastfeeding, rather the trial compared women who were randomized to early hospital discharge with telephone follow-up (with home visits by nurses only for those women who left hospital within 36 h of the birth &#8220;to encourage them to leave the hospital early&#8221;) versus usual care with later discharge from hospital.
