<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Methaqualone is a potent quinazoline, a class of sedative-hypnotics, that has a high potential for abuse. While the oral use of methaqualone (Quaalude, Mandrax) has waned in western countries since the mid-late 1980's, the practice of smoking methaqualone is a serious public health problem in South Africa, other parts of Africa and India. In the context of diminishing resources devoted to substance abuse treatment in regions affected by methaqualone abuse, it would be desirable to base treatment on the best evidence available. This review aimed to provide health care workers, policy-makers and consumers with the necessary information to make decisions regarding effective treatment of this highly dependence-producing drug.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To compare the effectiveness of any type of pharmacological or behavioural treatment administered in either an in-patient or out-patient setting compared with either a placebo or no treatment or a waiting list, or with another form of treatment administered in either an in- or out-patient setting. </P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-03-28 09:19:09 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Methaqualone is one of the most potent of the quinazolines, a class of sedative-hypnotics that is structurally and functionally related to glutethimide and the barbiturates. Apart from sedative-hypnotic properties, methaqualone has anti-convulsant, antispasmodic, anaesthetic and antihistamine actions. While the oral use of methaqualone (Quaalude, Mandrax, Melsedrin, Somnofac, Nocturne) has waned in western countries since the mid-late 1980's (<LINK REF="REF-Carroll-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carroll 1985</LINK>), the practice of smoking methaqualone is a serious public health problem in South Africa ( <LINK REF="REF-Bhana-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bhana 2002</LINK>), other parts of Africa (<LINK REF="REF-Adelekan-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Adelekan 1998</LINK>) and India (<LINK REF="REF-Indya.com-News-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Indya.com News 2001</LINK>) due to the adverse health and social consequences associated with methaqualone use and the widespread use of methaqualone in these developing countries (<LINK REF="REF-Bhana-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bhana 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>The pharmaco-kinetics of smoked methaqualone differs markedly from that of oral use. When used orally, it is combined with alcohol - a practice known as "Luuding out". "Luuding out" was practiced mainly in the USA and Western Europe in the 1970's to 1980's and is an outdated mode of methaqualone ingestion. With "Luuding out", the onset of the acute effects of methaqualone are slower (30 minutes) and have a shorter duration (two to four hours) compared to the practice of smoking (<LINK REF="REF-Carroll-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carroll 1985</LINK>). When smoked, methaqualone tablets are crushed and used together with cannabis and tobacco (in a broken off bottle neck) - a combination known as a "white pipe". The "white pipe" is usually smoked by a group of people. Immediately after inhaling "white pipe" smoke, the user experiences a short-lived euphoria ("the rush"). A tranquil state follows, that may last up to six hours. Tolerance is shown by a reduction in the duration of the second (tranquil) phase (<LINK REF="REF-McCarthy-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">McCarthy 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>Apart from differences in the modes of use, there are also differences in the demographic profile of oral methaqualone users from the 1970's-80's in the USA and current methaqualone/ white pipe smokers from developing countries. In the 1970's to mid 1980's, oral methaqualone users tended to be young, middle to upper class, of both genders, and educated (<LINK REF="REF-Carroll-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carroll 1985</LINK>). In contrast, "white pipe" users tend to be older, male, less educated, less likely to be gainfully employed, more likely to be involved in criminal activities (e.g. gangs) and originate from deprived socio-economic backgrounds (<LINK REF="REF-Bhana-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bhana 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>While South African treatment centre data suggest that methaqualone abuse is a predominantly male activity (Plüddemann 2002), these statistics may reflect admission policies, differential access to services based on socio-economic status and the limited availability of treatment services for marginalized groups (<LINK REF="REF-Myers-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Myers 2004</LINK>). It is thus questionable whether findings derived from the treatment context can be extrapolated to the general population (<LINK REF="REF-Myers2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Myers2003</LINK>). For example, women's utilization of treatment services may be hampered by the greater stigma associated with substance-related help seeking behaviour among women (<LINK REF="REF-Mphi-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mphi 1994</LINK>), the limited accessibility of services due to a lack of an independent income to pay for treatment, limited resources to arrange for independent childcare (<LINK REF="REF-Booth-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Booth 2000</LINK>), and the lack of women-sensitive treatment programmes with services that focus on the special needs of women such as domestic violence and sexual assault (<LINK REF="REF-Booth-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Booth 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>Little research data exists regarding the nature and outcomes of treatment for methaqualone dependence. In the USA, in-patient detoxification using a tapering course of short acting barbiturates or phenobarbital (a long acting barbiturate), followed by a psychiatric assessment to detect the presence of co-morbid depression or another psychiatric disorder was advocated (<LINK REF="REF-Carroll-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carroll 1985</LINK>). Should a co-morbid psychiatric disorder be detected, the use of anti-psychotics, anti-depressants, lithium or anxiolytics was recommended (<LINK REF="REF-Carroll-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carroll 1985</LINK>). Since the mid - late 1980's, barbiturate use in the USA has given way to benzodiazepines, since the latter have a much better safety- and side-effect profile. Since methaqualone abuse has hardly been prevalent in developed countries post-1985, literature on methaqualone detoxification is rare after the mid-1980's (<LINK REF="REF-McCarthy-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">McCarthy 2000</LINK>). At present, diazepam is the drug of choice for detoxifying people dependent on methaqualone in South Africa. In Sub-Saharan Africa, non-standardised detoxification protocols are often used, usually consisting of diazepam given to out-patients (<LINK REF="REF-McCarthy-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">McCarthy 2000</LINK>). Anecdotal reports of detoxification protocols used by specialist substance abuse treatment facilities in the Western Cape Province of South Africa show that treatment centres generally have their own in-patient detoxification regimens - either no drug detoxification or diazepam tapered over 3-7 days.</P>
<P>This study is restricted to adults since adolescence is a time of experimentation and also because it is more likely that adults will meet DSM-IV-R (<LINK REF="REF-DSM_x002d_IV-R" TYPE="REFERENCE">DSM-IV R</LINK>) or ICD-10 criteria for methaqualone dependence. We anticipate substantial differences in outcome between youth (18 - 21 years of age) and adults (&gt;21 years) with respect to abstinence and retention in the programme. In addition, outcomes for adolescent substance users are confounded by a number of variables, including stage of development, comorbid psychiatric diagnoses, and length of substance use history (<LINK REF="REF-McKay-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">McKay 2001</LINK>). This suggests that adolescents, who are dependent on methaqualone, may be qualitatively different from adults who are methaqualone dependent. A separate review on adolescent users may thus be required. Other factors that may influence treatment outcome include socio-demographic factors such as gender, especially because methaqualone abuse appears to be a predominantly male activity (Plüddemann 2002); fear of job loss; polysubstance use; treatment history; readiness to change; treatment readiness; perceived psychosocial support for abstinence; and ongoing involvement in other antisocial behaviours (e.g. gang membership) (<LINK REF="REF-Joe-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Joe 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McKay-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">McKay 2001</LINK>). The impact of these factors on treatment for methaqualone dependence has not been extensively researched.</P>
<P>In several developing countries in sub-Saharan and East Africa, methaqualone and cannabis place a greater burden on the health, social welfare and criminal justice systems than other illicit drugs (<LINK REF="REF-Adelekan-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Adelekan 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bhana-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bhana 2002</LINK>). For example, according to the United Nations Office for Drug Control and Crime Prevention (<LINK REF="REF-United-Nations-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">United Nations 2000</LINK>), cannabis and cannabis smoked together with Mandrax are South Africa's main illicit problem drugs of abuse. In addition, the South African Community Epidemiology Network on Drug Use (SACENDU) reports that approximately 85% of the world's methaqualone is consumed in South Africa. SACENDU also reports that, after alcohol, "White Pipe" and cannabis smoking are the most frequently reported primary substances of abuse among patients seen at specialist treatment centres in South Africa (<LINK REF="REF-Bhana-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bhana 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>In the context of diminishing resources devoted to substance abuse treatment in South Africa and the African continent, it would be desirable to base treatment on the best evidence available. Yet, to our knowledge, there are no published systematic reviews of treatment for methaqualone abuse and dependence. It is hoped that this review will provide health care workers, policy-makers and consumers with the necessary information to make decisions regarding the treatment of this highly dependence-producing drug.</P>

<P>
<BR/>(1) Residential programmes were defined as programmes where the patient resided at the treatment facility for a pre-determined period (e.g. 4 week or 12 week programme). The type, range and content of treatment offered by residential substance abuse programmes was largely dependent on the treatment model used by individual facilities. Services are generally provided by a multidisciplinary team of professionals. Most residential programmes offer a combination of one of the following types of treatment services: medicated or un-medicated detoxification, group therapy and group activities, individual counselling, and aftercare services.</P>
<P>(2) Therapeutic communities were defined as programmes that consisted of communal living with people in recovery, and a professional programme that tapered in intensity. The therapeutic community model strives to provide a social environment that is conducive to recovery through the provision of life skills and vocational training. Over time, the patient may go out to work during the day, returning to the facility during the evenings. The ability to maintain a drug-free treatment environment is less than that of residential programmes.</P>
<P>(3) Out-patient treatment programmes were defined as programme where the patient attended a facility for daytime groups and individual treatment services but continued to reside at their current domicile. Attendance is often erratic. Unless regular drug testing is conducted, the ability to maintain a drug-free treatment environment is non-existent. Failure at the out-patient level of care is a common indication for in-patient treatment.</P>
<P>We did not consider stand-alone self and mutual-help programmes (e.g. Narcotics Anonymous) in this review.</P>
<P>(4) Pharmacological treatments were defined as treatments which involved the provision of medication to (i) facilitate detoxification and (ii) help maintain abstinence from methaqualone.</P>
<P>(5) Psychosocial treatments were defined as treatment which involves the delivery of a psychosocial intervention programme such as twelve step facilitation therapy, cognitive-behavioural therapy, and/or motivational enhancement therapy that focus on changing the patient's motivation, cognitions, and or behaviour around substance use. These interventions can be delivered in an individual and/or group format.</P>

<B>Manual searches</B>
<BR/>The reference list of relevant articles and textbooks were scanned for references to relevant articles.<BR/>Congress proceedings of the Psychological Association of South Africa (PSYSSA 1980 to 2004); the South African Psychiatric Association (1980 to 2004); Indian Psychopharmacology Association (1960 to 2004); Indian Psychiatric Society (1960 to 2004); The International Conference on the Treatment of Addictive Behaviours (ICTAB 1980 to 2004) and the College of Problems of Drug Dependence (CPDD 1986 to 2004) were handsearched for all references to the treatment of methaqualone-related problems.</P>

<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
<P>We did not find any randomised controlled or quasi-randomised controlled trials of the treatment of methaqualone dependence in adults in MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL databases or through handsearching conference abstracts and proceedings. Personal communication with experts in the substance abuse treatment field from countries where methaqualone use has been known to be a health problem also failed to reveal any published or unpublished studies of treatment for methaqualone abuse or dependence. When we broadened the search to include observational studies, we found little information related to the treatment of methaqualone related problems.</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>Despite extensive electronic and handsearching that was not limited by language, geography, time or publication status, we were unable this to locate any randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials to assess the effectiveness of treatment for methaqualone dependence. Yet methaqualone use remains a serious health problem in sub-Saharan Africa and in the subcontinent of India. Properly conducted RCTs are regarded as the best method of assessing the effectiveness of health care interventions as they generate comparable intervention and non-intervention groups with the only differences between the groups being attributable to the effect of the intervention, or chance (<LINK REF="REF-Kleijnen-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kleijnen 1997</LINK>). This review identifies the need for future randomised controlled trials of current treatment approaches to methaqualone dependence.</P>
<P>Some of the issues that possible randomised controlled trials for the treatment of methaqualone dependence would need to consider include the ethical issue of delaying or denying potential effective treatment to participants in the "control group"; of the way in which random allocation to intervention conditions and the concealment of this allocation would occur in settings where participants would have contact with each other; whether these trials would compare in and outpatient programmes; and whether these trials would require participants to complete detoxification prior to being assigned to a treatment condition. </P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>As no evidence exists for current treatment practices, practitioners should lobby for the development of randomised controlled trials and for clients in their care to be included into such randomised controlled trials. At present there is no evidence for the benefits or arm of one treatment modality over another for methaqualone dependence.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Randomised controlled trials for the treatment of methaqualone dependence are urgently required, especially because methaqualone poses a serious threat to the public health of Southern Africa and in the Indian sub-continent.</P>
