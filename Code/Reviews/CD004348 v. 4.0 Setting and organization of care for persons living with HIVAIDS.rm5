<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Policy makers and health workers need evidence about how and where to provide care for people living with HIV/AIDS. This review identified 28 studies involving 39,776 study subjects that examined these questions. Centres with a lot of HIV/AIDS patients often had lower death rates. The number of patients needed to get these results was very different in each study so it is not clear what the right number is. Settings with case management had fewer deaths and had higher use of antiretroviral medications. There were several other promising interventions to increase antiretroviral use (using several health interventions at the same time and using computerized reminders), to reduce hospital admissions (using multiple health disciplines and increasing hours of operation), and reducing length of hospital stay (telephone notices and advice for providers). Unfortunately, the design of these studies, the small number of studies on each intervention and the lack of standard terms and definitions limits their usefulness to health providers and policy-makers. This is especially true for developing countries as no studies were found from those settings. </P>
</SUMMARY_BODY>
</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Treating the world's 40.3 million persons currently infected with HIV/AIDS is an international responsibility that involves unprecedented organizational challenges. Key issues include whether care should be concentrated or decentralized, what type and mix of health workers are needed, and which interventions and mix of programs are best. High volume centres, case management and multi-disciplinary care have been shown to be effective for some chronic illnesses. Application of these findings to HIV/AIDS is less well understood. </P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>Our objective was to evaluate the association between the setting and organization of care and outcomes for people living with HIV/AIDS. </P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>Computerized searches from January 1, 1980 to December 31, 2002 of MEDLINE, EMBASE, Dissertation Abstracts International (DAI), CINAHL, HealthStar, PsychInfo, PsychLit, Social Sciences Abstracts, and Sociological Abstracts as well as searches of meeting abstracts and relevant journals and bibliographies in articles that met inclusion criteria. Searches included articles published in English and other languages. </P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Articles were considered for inclusion if they were observational or experimental studies with contemporaneous comparison groups of adults and/or children currently infected with HIV/AIDS that examined the impact of the setting and/or organization of care on outcomes of mortality, opportunistic infections, use of HAART and prophylaxis, quality of life, health care utilization, and costs for patient with HIV/AIDS. </P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Two authors independently screened abstracts to determine relevance. Full paper copies were reviewed against the inclusion criteria. The findings were extracted by both authors and compared. The 28 studies that met inclusion criteria were too disparate with respect to populations, interventions and outcomes to warrant meta-analysis. </P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Twenty-eight studies were included involving 39,776 study subjects. The studies indicated that case management strategies and higher hospital and ward volume of HIV-positive patients were associated with decreased mortality. Case management was also associated with increased receipt of ARVs. The results for multidisciplinary teams or multi-faceted treatment varied. None of the studies examined quality of life or immunological or virological outcomes. Healthcare utilization outcomes were mixed. </P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>Certain settings of care (i.e. high volume of HIV positive patients) and models of care (i.e. case management) may improve patient mortality and other outcomes. More detailed descriptions of care models, consistent definition of terms, and studies on innovative models suitable for developing countries are needed. There is not yet enough evidence to guide policy and clinical care in this area. </P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
</ABSTRACT>
<BODY>
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Despite falling prevalence rates in some countries, and advances made in care and treatment, the global HIV/AIDS epidemic continues to surge. At the end of 2005, 40.3 million people were living with HIV infection and in 2005 alone, 3.1 million people died of HIV-related causes (<LINK REF="REF-UNAIDS_x002f_WHO-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">UNAIDS/WHO 2005</LINK>). HIV/AIDS is now the fourth largest cause of death world-wide (<LINK REF="REF-WHO2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO2003</LINK>). Without a concerted global effort, another 45 million persons will be infected with the human immunodeficiency virus by 2010 (<LINK REF="REF-UNAIDS-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">UNAIDS 2004</LINK>). The burden of new infections and of death is highest in developing countries (<LINK REF="REF-UNAIDS_x002f_WHO-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">UNAIDS/WHO 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-UNAIDS-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">UNAIDS 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>In the 1990s, highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) became widely available in many industrialized countries which resulted in a sharp and sustained decline in the incidence of AIDS and AIDS-related mortality in those countries (<LINK REF="REF-Sepkowitz-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sepkowitz 2001</LINK>). The United Nations' 2001 Declaration of Commitment on HIV/AIDS emphasized that all people infected with HIV have the right to treatment (<LINK REF="REF-UN2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">UN2001</LINK>). Furthermore, the Declaration recognized that treatment, care and support, including antiretroviral therapy, are fundamental components of any effective response (<LINK REF="REF-UN2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">UN2003</LINK>). </P>
<P>However, there are substantial challenges to the provision of care and of antiretroviral medications in both developed and developing country settings. Several of the key issues involved relate to where care should be provided and how it should be organized. For example, there is debate about whether care should be concentrated in regional centres or decentralized to communities, what type of health workers and what kind of health worker teams are needed, which interventions and mix of programs are best and what hours of operation are most appropriate. There is evidence from examining other types of health conditions that disease management models for chronic illnesses can improve a variety of health outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-Ofman-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ofman 2004</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Badamgarav-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Badamgarav 2003</LINK>). Case management approaches have been effective for certain chronic diseases including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (<LINK REF="REF-Egan-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Egan 2002</LINK>), congestive heart failure (<LINK REF="REF-Taylor-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Taylor 2005</LINK>) and diabetes mellitus (<LINK REF="REF-Choe-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Choe 2005</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Howe-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Howe 2005</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Krein-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Krein 2004</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Aubert-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aubert 1998</LINK>). Care provided by multidisciplinary teams has been shown to be effective in depression (<LINK REF="REF-Katon-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Katon 2004</LINK>), diabetes mellitus (<LINK REF="REF-Maislos-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maislos 2004</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Majumdar-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Majumdar 2003</LINK>) and COPD (<LINK REF="REF-Rea-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rea 2004</LINK>). Regionalization of care and high volume care have been associated with improved outcomes of several kinds of specialized care and procedures, most likely as a result of accumulated expertise of the health care team and better adherence to evidence-based care (<LINK REF="REF-Glance-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glance 2006</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Battaglia-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Battaglia 2006</LINK>). The application of this evidence to HIV/AIDS is much less well understood. It is also unclear whether settings that teach students and residents or that perform clinical trials provide better HIV/AIDS care. </P>
<P>The purpose of this review is to determine the current state of the evidence on setting and/or organizational interventions to improve healthcare for persons living with HIV/AIDS. An update to April 2006 is in process. An underlying assumption of the review is that certain interventions of setting and organization may have an effect on patient outcomes including mortality and the use of antiretroviral therapy. These outcomes were specifically chosen as the focus for this review because of their importance for patients living with HIV/AIDS. </P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>The objective of this review was to determine the effectiveness of the setting of care (concentration and volume of patients, participation in clinical trials, incorporating trainees, travel time to providers) and the organization of care (case management, multi-disciplinary care, multi-faceted treatment, hours of service, outreach, health information systems) on medical, immunological/virological, psychosocial and/or economic outcomes for persons living with HIV/AIDS.</P>
</OBJECTIVES>
<METHODS>
<SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<CRIT_STUDIES>
<P>Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) controlled clinical trials (CCTs) cohort studies, case control studies, cross-sectional studies and controlled before and after designs. <BR/>Studies without a comparison group were excluded. No geographic or language restrictions were applied. </P>
</CRIT_STUDIES>
<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>Persons known to be infected with HIV/AIDS. Studies of men, women, or both, children, adults, or both, and pregnant women were eligible.</P>
</CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>To be considered, studies had to describe any or more of the following interventions:</P>
<P>1. Setting of care: concentration and volume of HIV patients, participation in clinical trials, incorporating trainees and travel time to providers. Incorporating trainees included health care students, interns or residents.</P>
<P>2. Organization of care: case management, multidisciplinary teams, multifaceted treatment and clinic organization (hours of operation, outreach, health information systems). Case management was often used without any explanation of how care was organized or provided and for that reason we excluded studies if they did not fully describe the term "case management." Multidisciplinary care referred to the use of "two or more providers other than standard physician, nursing or nurse practitioner care". Multi-faceted care referred to the use of "two or more or treatment programs other than standard physician, nursing or nurse practitioner care".</P>
<P>We also excluded studies that used computer-based interventions that did not affect the organization or provision of care. For example, studies that looked at patient use of or access to a computer database that did not otherwise influence care delivery were excluded. This type of intervention, aimed at only the patient, would be part of a review of patient support and education but was not relevant to settings or organization of care.<BR/> <BR/>We excluded studies that had specific programs as the sole intervention, such as methadone maintenance programs and counseling programs, if the organization of care was otherwise the same between the study and control groups. Our rationale was that these programs warranted independent reviews of their own, with revised search criteria specific for each particular program. However, studies with such programs were still eligible for inclusion in this review if these programs were part of a multi-disciplinary or multi-faceted treatment intervention. </P>
<P>Studies that included insurance status only were excluded as this topic warranted separate review. </P>
</CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<CRIT_OUTCOMES>
<P>For the purposes of this study, we were interested in the following outcome measures:</P>
<P>1. Medical outcomes: studies that included mortality, progression to AIDS, opportunistic infections and cancers, hospitalizations, proportion of patients on antiretroviral medications, proportion of patients on indicated prophylaxis, and functional status/disability.</P>
<P>2. Immunological or virological outcomes: studies that measured CD4 and/or viral load.</P>
<P>3. Psychosocial outcomes: studies that included an outcome measure for quality of life (such as MOS-HIV score) and/or illness intrusiveness.</P>
<P>4. Economic outcomes: studies that included information about healthcare utilization (length of hospital stay, emergency department use, visits to providers) and treatment costs.</P>
<P>Studies that examined pregnancy specific outcomes only such as prematurity or low birth weight were excluded.</P>
</CRIT_OUTCOMES>
</SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<SEARCH_METHODS>
<P>Electronic searches were run for the period January 1,1980 to December 2002. This time period will be extended to April 30, 2006 for the next revision which is planned by the end of 2006. We searched the following databases: </P>
<P>MEDLINE, EMBASE, Dissertation Abstracts International (DAI), Cumulative Index to Nursing &amp; Allied Health (CINAHL), HealthStar, PsycInfo, PsycLit, Social Sciences Abstracts, and Sociological Abstracts. Electronic searches were also performed for abstracts from major AIDS conferences such as ICAAC, CROI and international and world AIDS conferences. We also searched the related articles feature of PubMed to help us identify relevant studies. </P>
<P>Reference lists from pertinent articles, books and review articles were scanned to identify further studies for possible inclusion. </P>
<P>Web of Science and Social Sciences Citation Index (SSCI) were searched for authors of key pertinent articles. Internet searches were performed to find web sites describing studies pertinent to the review. </P>
<P>We searched for any unpublished journal articles relevant to the review. Hand searching of tables of contents of the following journals was also performed: Aids Patient Care and STDs, Clinical Infectious Diseases, European Journal of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases, International Journal of STDs and AIDS, Journal of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndromes, Journal of the International Association of Physicians in AIDS Care. </P>
<P>We employed the following librarian-developed search string to identify relevant studies for this review when we performed our electronic searches:</P>

</SEARCH_METHODS>
<DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Studies that met the selection criteria for inclusion were identified according to the selection criteria described above. There were four stages to the review process:</P>
<P>Stage 1<BR/>Titles of studies that were identified by the search were screened independently by two reviewers (AMT, CH, JR, SI) in order to eliminate titles/topics that were not pertinent to the research question. If there was any uncertainty or disagreement between the two reviewers based on the title, a review of the abstract was conducted. </P>
<P>Stage 2<BR/>Following the initial title screen, two reviewers (AMT, CH) independently evaluated each selected abstract using an identical, pre-determined checklist of the inclusion criteria If both reviewers determined that the study was not eligible for inclusion, no further action was taken. If one or both reviewers determined that the study might be eligible for inclusion, the full text of the article was obtained. </P>
<P>Stage 3 <BR/>Each reviewer (AMT, CH) independently read full paper copies of the studies and determined whether they fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Disagreements between the reviewers were resolved either by discussion and consensus or through the involvement of a third, independent reviewer (RG). </P>
<P>Stage 4<BR/>Data were extracted independently by two reviewers (AMT,CH) from the relevant studies using a data extraction tool and then data were compared. Data extracted included: gender of subjects, ethnicity of subjects, total number of subjects included in the study, mean age and range of participants, study design, description of the intervention, and outcomes measured. Study authors were contacted for further information as required. Any disagreements were resolved by discussion or by a third reviewer (RG). Assessment of quality was undertaken independently by two reviewers (AMT, CH, RG).</P>
<P>As the heterogeneity of study design, comparison of groups, intervention types, settings and patients was substantial, an overall estimate of effect would have little practical meaning. Therefore, a qualitative summary of the findings is presented in the Characteristics of Included Studies Table. </P>
</DATA_COLLECTION>
</METHODS>
<RESULTS>
<STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<P>The search of the computerised databases identified a total of 11 266 citations. After excluding duplicates and studies clearly not related to the objective of our review, 1335 abstracts were considered in the selection procedure. Based on full text review, 16 studies were included in the review. Screening of references and re-evaluation of studies with a refined inclusion criteria resulted in another 12 studies that met the inclusion criteria. Consequently, 28 studies were included in the review. </P>
<P>-Included studies:</P>
<P>There were 28 studies that fully met our inclusion criteria and were included in this review. These 28 studies comprised 27 patient samples, as two of the included studies were of the same patient population (<LINK REF="STD-Bennett-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Bennett 1995</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Bennett-1996b" TYPE="STUDY">Bennett 1996b</LINK>). </P>

<P>There were a total of 39 776 study subjects included in this review, all of whom were HIV positive. Most personal characteristics were reported inconsistently across the studies. </P>
<P>-Outcomes of Included Studies:</P>
<P>Twelve of the included studies contained a mortality outcome for various interventions of interest (<LINK REF="STD-Aiken-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Aiken 1999</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Bennett-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Bennett 1992</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Bennett-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Bennett 1995</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Bennett-1996a" TYPE="STUDY">Bennett 1996a</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Bennett-1996b" TYPE="STUDY">Bennett 1996b</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Curtis-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Curtis 1997</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Horner-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Horner 1995</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Laine-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Laine 1998</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Laraque-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Laraque 1996</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Safran-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Safran 1995</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Stone-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Stone 1992</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Turner-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Turner 1992</LINK>).

There were five studies with hospitalization as an outcome (<LINK REF="STD-Katz-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Katz 2001</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Keitz-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Keitz 2001</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Laine-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Laine 1999</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Newschaffer-1998b" TYPE="STUDY">Newschaffer 1998b</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Safran-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Safran 1995</LINK>) Two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Safran-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Safran 1995</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Turner-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Turner 1998</LINK>) had progressing to AIDS as an outcome.

</STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<STUDY_QUALITY>
<P>As the majority of studies were observational rather than experimental, we did not use the methodological criteria developed for randomized trials. Rather, we identified the main threat to validity in these studies as uncontrolled confounding, including age, sex, route of HIV transmission, race, case mix, and insurance status. Each study was rated on each of these six factors by three reviewers independently (CH, AMT, RG) and scores out of six were tallied. Conflicts between reviewers were resolved through discussion or through the intervention of a third reviewer. The scores were not used as continuous measures of quality but rather studies that controlled for case mix (in our judgment the most serious potentially confounding factor) were considered of higher quality as were those that controlled for at least 4 out of 6 factors. </P>
<P>The majority of studies controlled for relevant potentially confounding factors. Only four studies did not control for case mix (<LINK REF="STD-Chan-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Chan 2002</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Holzemer-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Holzemer 1992</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Turner-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Turner 1998</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Markson-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Markson 1998</LINK>) and only four studies controlled for fewer than 4/6 potentially confounding factors (<LINK REF="STD-Bennett-1996a" TYPE="STUDY">Bennett 1996a</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Holzemer-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Holzemer 1992</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Messeri-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Messeri 2002</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Safran-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Safran 1995</LINK>). Omitting the results of these studies would have removed one negative study of the relationship between patient volumes and mortality (<LINK REF="STD-Bennett-1996a" TYPE="STUDY">Bennett 1996a</LINK>) but would not have affected any of the conclusions about mortality or ARV use. Findings about social services case management and entry and continuity in appropriate health care (<LINK REF="STD-Messeri-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Messeri 2002</LINK>) and the relationship between computer prompts and proportion of patients on ARVs and indicated prophylaxis (<LINK REF="STD-Safran-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Safran 1995</LINK>) would have been affected. These results would not have been considered significant if the relevant studies had been removed. See Quality (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>). </P>
</STUDY_QUALITY>
<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
<P>For the purposes of this section we have divided the results between studies that examined the 'setting of care' and studies that examined the 'organization of care'. In some cases studies evaluated both setting and organization. We have listed under each heading the intervention of interest and ordered the outcomes reviewed in each section as: 1) medical outcomes, especially mortality and antiretroviral treatment; 2) psychosocial outcomes; and 3) utilization and economic outcomes. There were no studies that measured immunological or virological outcomes.</P>
<P>A. Setting of Care</P>
<P>Intervention: Concentration of HIV/AIDS Patients</P>
<P>One prospective cohort study (<LINK REF="STD-Aiken-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Aiken 1999</LINK>) demonstrated lower 30-day mortality in groups of AIDS patients that were hospitalized in facilities that contained units dedicated to HIV/AIDS care as compared to patients that were hospitalized in facilities without units dedicated to HIV/AIDS care. The mortality benefit in the facilities with units dedicated to HIV/AIDS care seemed to occur both with patients on the dedicated AIDS units themselves, as well as with HIV positive patients in scattered-bed units elsewhere in the hospital. Patients on both of these units showed more than a 40% lower 30-day mortality as compared to conventional hospitals with no unit dedicated to HIV/AIDS care. However, only the AIDS hospital scattered-bed units achieved statistical significance (OR 0.53, CI 0.36-0.89). The dedicated AIDS units themselves may have failed to achieve statistical significance (OR 0.57, CI 0.25-1.10) due to inadequate power. There were approximately three times the number of HIV patients in the units dedicated to HIV/AIDS care compared to the scattered bed units. In this study, hospitals that did not have a unit that was dedicated to HIV/AIDS care, but that were considered to be 'magnet' hospitals also showed a statistically significant lower 30-day mortality as compared to the conventional scattered-bed hospitals (OR 0.36, CI 0.14-0.92). However, no data on the volume or concentration of HIV patients in these 'magnet' hospitals were provided. </P>
<P>Intervention: Volume of HIV/AIDS Patients</P>
<P>Nine retrospective cohort studies describing eight study samples - <LINK REF="STD-Bennett-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Bennett 1995</LINK> and 1996b were two different papers of the same sample - had patient mortality as one of the outcomes. Five of these studies (<LINK REF="STD-Bennett-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Bennett 1992</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Bennett-1996b" TYPE="STUDY">Bennett 1996b</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Laine-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Laine 1998</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Stone-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Stone 1992</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Turner-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Turner 1992</LINK>) concluded that there was a benefit in terms of mortality for patients who were cared for in high volume institutions. The definition of high volume varied considerably in these studies: &#8805; 43 annual hospital discharges (<LINK REF="STD-Stone-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Stone 1992</LINK>), &#8805; 100 clinic patients from 1986-1992 (<LINK REF="STD-Laine-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Laine 1998</LINK>), &#8805; 160 annual hospital patients (<LINK REF="STD-Bennett-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Bennett 1992</LINK>), and 2798 annual discharges (<LINK REF="STD-Bennett-1996b" TYPE="STUDY">Bennett 1996b</LINK>). </P>
<P>Four of the studies (<LINK REF="STD-Horner-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Horner 1995</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Bennett-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Bennett 1995</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Bennett-1996a" TYPE="STUDY">Bennett 1996a</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Curtis-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Curtis 1997</LINK>) showed no statistically significant benefit in mortality in the high-volume group. The definition of high volume in this group was somewhat different: greater than or equal to 300 hospital patients in 3 years (<LINK REF="STD-Horner-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Horner 1995</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Bennett-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Bennett 1995</LINK>), high volume having four times as many hospital patients as low volume in three years (<LINK REF="STD-Bennett-1996a" TYPE="STUDY">Bennett 1996a</LINK>) and high volume having 5 times the number of hospital patients as low in 3 years. </P>
<P>Three of the four negative studies had small sample sizes (see Characteristics of Included Studies Table), perhaps too small to demonstrate a significant mortality outcome. Despite analyzing the same sample of patients, <LINK REF="STD-Bennett-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Bennett 1995</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Bennett-1996b" TYPE="STUDY">Bennett 1996b</LINK> defines high volume differently in each study, as volume of PCP cases and hospital caseload of people with HIV/AIDS, respectively, thus resulting in one positive and one negative outcome.</P>
<P>Keitz (<LINK REF="STD-Keitz-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Keitz 2001</LINK>), the only RCT in the review, examined the difference between 214 HIV-infected adults who were randomized to either a high-volume HIV infectious diseases practice (1100 HIV-infected patients) or a low-volume (&lt;50 HIV-infected patients) general medicine practice. The proportion of patients on ARVs and indicated prophylaxis and the rate of hospitalization was similar between the two groups. </P>
<P>The <LINK REF="STD-Keitz-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Keitz 2001</LINK> study also showed significantly fewer emergency department (ED) visits (31 vs. 43 visits, p=0.01) and shorter hospital stays (5.3 days vs. 9.0 days, p=0.01) in patients randomized to the high volume practice. There was no difference between the groups in terms of patient visits to the home clinic. There was also no statistically significant difference in psychosocial outcomes between these two groups. Markson (<LINK REF="STD-Markson-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Markson 1998</LINK>) demonstrated that higher volume institutions had significantly fewer patients with 2 or more ED visits (aOR 0.56, 0.44-0.71) when compared with patients from lower volume institutions. </P>
<P>Five of the retrospective cohort studies looked at the effect of HIV-volume on length of hospital stay. Two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Bennett-1996a" TYPE="STUDY">Bennett 1996a</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Stone-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Stone 1992</LINK>) demonstrated longer hospital stays in facilities with higher HIV-volume with differences of 5.0 and 2.7 days, respectively, while three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Bennett-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Bennett 1992</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Bennett-1996b" TYPE="STUDY">Bennett 1996b</LINK> &amp; <LINK REF="STD-Curtis-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Curtis 1997</LINK>) had differences of 2.0 days or less which were not statistically significant. </P>
<P>Intervention: Conducts Clinical Trials</P>
<P>Four studies (<LINK REF="STD-Turner-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Turner 1999</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Turner-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Turner 2000</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Turner-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Turner 2001</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Newschaffer-1998b" TYPE="STUDY">Newschaffer 1998b</LINK>) evaluated clinical trials as a feature of the setting of care. The three Turner studies reported that conducting clinical trials led to a significantly larger proportion of patients being on antiretroviral therapy: (OR 1.78, CI 1.37-2.32 <LINK REF="STD-Turner-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Turner 1999</LINK>; p&lt;0.001 <LINK REF="STD-Turner2000" TYPE="STUDY">Turner2000</LINK>; and OR 1.43, CI 1.01-2.04 <LINK REF="STD-Turner-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Turner 2001</LINK>respectively). However, Newschaffer (<LINK REF="STD-Newschaffer-1998b" TYPE="STUDY">Newschaffer 1998b</LINK>) did not show any difference in the number of patients on HAART (OR 1.24, CI 0.90-1.72) despite having a comparable sample size to the Turner studies. The Newschaffer (<LINK REF="STD-Newschaffer-1998b" TYPE="STUDY">Newschaffer 1998b</LINK>) study also did not show any significant difference in terms of hospitalization rates when clinical trials were conducted. </P>
<P>Intervention: Incorporates Trainees</P>
<P>Three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Bennett-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Bennett 1992</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Bennett-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Bennett 1995</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Horner-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Horner 1995</LINK>) assessed the effect of the incorporation of trainees in the delivery of healthcare. None of these studies demonstrated a statistically significant impact on in-hospital mortality with this feature (OR 1.57, CI 0.94-2.62, OR 0.96, CI 0.68-1.35, and OR 1.58, CI 0.94-2.65 respectively). </P>
<P>B. Organization of Care</P>
<P>Intervention: Case Management</P>
<P>Three studies included a case management intervention. Katz (<LINK REF="STD-Katz-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Katz 2001</LINK>) defined a case manager as "a social worker, nurse, AIDS service organization staff member, staff in other service organizations, or anyone else who is assigned to help [one] get and coordinate care". A case manager in Laraque (<LINK REF="STD-Laraque-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Laraque 1996</LINK>) "assessed the patient's needs and helped in obtaining financial entitlements, such as social security, medical insurance, welfare, food stamps, safe housing, and access to medication. The case manager offered nutritional advice, ensured adequate medical management by monitoring each patient's medical progress, and made certain that all patients were discharged with appropriate housing and support. Finally, the case manager visited the patients and their families to provide psychosocial support." Messeri (<LINK REF="STD-Messeri-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Messeri 2002</LINK>) divided case managers into three types:<BR/>(i) case manager, medical referral: "case manager has referred respondent to a specific medical service"; (ii) case manager, counseling: " case manager has counseled respondent about personal problems, drug use, safe sex, combination therapy and has checked how client is doing"; (iii) case manager, social services: "case manager has developed a care plan, coordinated specific social services, filled out forms for entitlements." </P>
<P>Laraque (<LINK REF="STD-Laraque-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Laraque 1996</LINK>) was the only study that evaluated a mortality outcome. It showed improved two-year survival (86% vs. 64%, p&lt;.001) for patients who were actively involved in an Early Intervention Program (EIP) as compared to patients who were not actively involved in this program. This EIP included case management (as described above). </P>
<P>Katz (<LINK REF="STD-Katz-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Katz 2001</LINK>) showed that contact with a case manager resulted in an increased number of patients on a protease inhibitor (PI) or a non-nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) (aOR 1.29 (CI 1.02-1.64)). Sustained contact (ie. contact both at baseline and at follow up) with a case manager resulted in an even larger effect (aOR 1.53, CI 1.22-1.92). Sustained contact with a case manager also led to a significantly greater number of patients on antibiotic prophylaxis (aOR 1.77, CI 1.28-2.46). </P>
<P>Katz (<LINK REF="STD-Katz-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Katz 2001</LINK>) did not find a difference in hospitalization rates (OR 1.11, CI 0.83-1.50).</P>
<P>Messeri (<LINK REF="STD-Messeri-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Messeri 2002</LINK>) demonstrated that a 'social services' case manager resulted in a statistically significant increase in both entry (OR 3.3, p&lt;0.05) and continuity (OR 2.9, p&lt;0.01) in appropriate medical care. </P>
<P>Katz (<LINK REF="STD-Katz-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Katz 2001</LINK>) showed no significant association between case management and emergency room visits. </P>
<P>Intervention: Multidisciplinary or Multi-faceted Treatment</P>
<P>Six of the twenty-eight studies had interventions under the category of multidisciplinary or multi-faceted treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Le-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Le 1998</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Newschaffer-1998a" TYPE="STUDY">Newschaffer 1998a</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Newschaffer-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Newschaffer 1999</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Chan-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Chan 2002</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Turner-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Turner 1999</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Turner-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Turner 2000</LINK>). All six studies were retrospective cohort studies. </P>
<P>None of these six studies included mortality as an outcome.</P>
<P>Newschaffer (<LINK REF="STD-Newschaffer-1998a" TYPE="STUDY">Newschaffer 1998a</LINK>), Turner (<LINK REF="STD-Turner-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Turner 1999</LINK>) and Turner (<LINK REF="STD-Turner-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Turner 2001</LINK>) looked at antiretroviral (ARV) treatment as an outcome. The multi-faceted interventions differed considerably between the studies. The subjects in these studies were pregnant females and were drawn from New York State Medicaid files. Turner's studies showed a statistically significant association between receipt of comprehensive care and receipt of ARVs (aOR 3.23, CI 2.42-4.31, aOR 1.67, CI 1.24-2.25 respectively). The two Turner studies describe their multifaceted intervention as one that consisted of providers who "guaranteed they would offer certain HIV-specific services, including access to specialists in HIV care; pre- and post-test counseling; referral for special studies, tests, consultations, or psychosocial services; care coordination; and after-hours care."<BR/> <BR/>Newschaffer (<LINK REF="STD-Newschaffer-1998a" TYPE="STUDY">Newschaffer 1998a</LINK>) concluded that participation in a multi-faceted prenatal care assistance program (PCAP) was not associated with increased receipt of ARVs. The PCAP "developed plans of care, coordinated services across a range of providers, provided risk assessment, health education, nutritional counseling, HIV testing and counseling, and psychosocial assessment&#8230; included [were] provisions that clinics [had] plans for referring women to drug treatment, HIV management and genetic and mental health services when necessary." </P>
<P>Le (<LINK REF="STD-Le-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Le 1998</LINK>) concluded there was a decrease in the total number of hospital admissions for patients receiving multidisciplinary treatment vs. non-multidisciplinary treatment (21% vs. 24% respectively, OR 0.63; CI 0.46-0.85). The stated purpose of the interdisciplinary team was to "improve access to health education, nutrition, psychosocial, psychiatric and pharmacy services by personnel specifically trained in the management of HIV-related issues."</P>
<P>Two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Le-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Le 1998</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Newschaffer-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Newschaffer 1999</LINK>) included emergency department (ED) use as an outcome. Le (<LINK REF="STD-Le-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Le 1998</LINK>) showed no difference between multidisciplinary vs. non-multidisciplinary groups in terms of ED use. Newschaffer (<LINK REF="STD-Newschaffer-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Newschaffer 1999</LINK>) indicated that patients enrolled in a multidisciplinary practice had an increased use of the emergency department. According to the authors, the increased use might be explained by the fact that women who had received more education and counseling might be more aware of potentially serious symptoms and thus more inclined to visit an emergency department. Alternate explanations for this association were that the women enrolled in the PCAP program may have been sicker to begin with or may have had a predisposition to higher use of services. </P>
<P>Chan (<LINK REF="STD-Chan-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Chan 2002</LINK>) reported increased primary medical care visits (p &#8804; 0.05 and retention in primary care p &#8804;0.01) in a multifaceted ancillary services group. This multifaceted program provided clients with "a range of services that include[d] case management, dental care, drug reimbursement, health insurance, home health care, hospice care, mental health therapy, nutritional services, rehabilitation services, substance use treatment, and other services of a treatment nature." </P>
<P>Intervention: Health Information Systems</P>
<P>Three studies were available for this comparison (<LINK REF="STD-Smith-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 1996</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Holzemer-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Holzemer 1992</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Safran-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Safran 1995</LINK>). Safran (<LINK REF="STD-Safran-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Safran 1995</LINK>), a controlled clinical trial of 349 HIV positive patients in Israel, demonstrated that using computer alerts and reminders about immunizations, test results and prescribing for primary care providers did not show any benefit in the computer-prompt group (n=191) in terms of mortality (one year survival rate 91% in intervention group vs. 88% in control group, p=0.19). However, the computer prompts did appear to significantly hasten initiation of recommended treatments for patients with HIV/AIDS. Treatments included initiating antiretroviral treatment (median of 7 days vs. 43 days, no p value provided) as well as initiating indicated PCP prophylaxis (median of 11 days vs. 122 days, p&lt;0.0001). This study did not show any difference in hospital admissions between the groups receiving and not receiving prompts.(35% versus 44%, respectively, p=0.47).<BR/> <BR/>Holzemer (<LINK REF="STD-Holzemer-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Holzemer 1992</LINK>), a prospective cohort study, did not show any difference in functional status between patients who were cared for in hospital with a computer-generated nursing pathway vs. a manually- generated nursing pathway. Nursing pathways described interventions and expected outcomes for defined groups of patients.</P>
<P>Smith (<LINK REF="STD-Smith-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 1996</LINK>), a prospective cohort study, concluded that the average length of hospital stay decreased over a two year period in a group of HIV positive patients whose GPs were given discharge information from and 24/7 phone access to an infectious diseases specialist. Mean length of hospital stay in this intervention group decreased from 16.6 days in 1992 to 8.0 days in 1994 (p=0.004). The control group had a decrease of 17.1 days to 13.1 days (p=0.79). </P>
<P>Safran (<LINK REF="STD-Safran-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Safran 1995</LINK>) did not show any differences in healthcare utilization outcomes (physician visits p=0.29 and emergency department visits p=0.24). </P>
<P>Intervention: Hours of Service</P>
<P>None of the twenty-eight studies evaluated the impact of hours of service on mortality, functional status, immunological or virological outcomes. However, three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Laine-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Laine 1999</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Newschaffer-1998b" TYPE="STUDY">Newschaffer 1998b</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Markson-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Markson 1998</LINK>) examined of the effect of clinic hours on healthcare utilization outcomes on patients from NY State Medicaid files. Laine (<LINK REF="STD-Laine-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Laine 1999</LINK>) determined that evening and weekend clinic hours significantly decreased the rate of hospitalization in the year prior to AIDS diagnosis (AOR 0.77, CI 0.63-0.93). </P>
<P>Newschaffer (<LINK REF="STD-Newschaffer-1998b" TYPE="STUDY">Newschaffer 1998b</LINK>) did not detect a significant difference in hospitalization rates in the mid-AIDS interval when clinic hours were 'increased'. It was unclear whether the increased clinic hours in the Newschaffer study were similar to the evening and weekend clinic hours of the Laine (<LINK REF="STD-Laine-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Laine 1999</LINK>) study. Neither of these two studies showed any difference in hospitalization rates when on-call physicians are available by phone. </P>
<P>Markson (<LINK REF="STD-Markson-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Markson 1998</LINK>) showed that evening and weekend clinic hours were associated with fewer emergency department visits (OR 0.77, CI 0.64-0.93). The availability of an on-call physician was also associated with fewer emergency department visits (OR 0.77, CI -0.65-0.92). </P>
</INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>Nine studies examined the relationship between hospital, ward or clinic concentration or volume of patients and the majority of these found lower mortality in settings with greater concentration or volume. Among the studies that showed non-significant results, confidence intervals were wide in three (<LINK REF="STD-Horner-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Horner 1995</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Bennett-1996a" TYPE="STUDY">Bennett 1996a</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Curtis-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Curtis 1997</LINK>) and one was a duplicate report of a study that reported positive results with a different measure of volume (<LINK REF="STD-Bennett-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Bennett 1995</LINK>). </P>
<P>High concentration and high volume were variously defined, not permitting estimation of threshold numbers that would be relevant for practice. Nonetheless, these findings suggest that hospital, ward or clinic experience may be important for reducing mortality. The mechanisms of this potential benefit are not available in the included studies as results for proportion on ARVs or indicated prophylaxis or on health care utilization were examined in only a few of these studies and the results were inconsistent. More experienced health care professionals and teams may have practiced closer to recommended guidelines or been more aggressive, but this cannot be confirmed using available evidence. Although these observational studies attempted to control for potentially confounding factors and all controlled for case mix, residual confounding could still have affected the results. Because high volume settings often are tertiary care centres, it is possible that they attracted sicker patients, thus under-estimating the extent of benefit from high concentration and volume of patients.</P>
<P>Four studies examined use of ARVs in relation to settings that conduct clinical trials and three of these found higher proportions of patients on ARVs in settings that conduct trials. One study that examined hospitalization found no difference between settings that did and did not conduct trials. Patient volumes were not reported for any of these settings but it is likely that some centres both have higher volumes and conduct trials. Many large academic centres would fit this description. Incorporating trainees might also be expected to take place more often in academic centres but there were no relationships found between incorporating trainees and in-hospital mortality. The confidence intervals were very wide in these studies. This evidence suggests that there is higher ARV use in settings that conduct trials, possibly due to the presence of ARV trials or increased comfort with ARVs among providers or patients in those settings. This finding could also be related to volume or concentration of patients or expertise of providers but the included studies do not include that information.</P>
<P>The only study (<LINK REF="STD-Laraque-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Laraque 1996</LINK>) that examined mortality in relation to case management found significantly lower mortality in the case management group. Another study of case management found higher rates of ARVs use and indicated prophylaxis in the case management group but no difference in hospital admission rates (<LINK REF="STD-Katz-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Katz 2001</LINK>). Case management was described somewhat differently in these studies, precluding direct comparisons. Case management was associated with increased entry and continuity of medical care in one study (<LINK REF="STD-Messeri-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Messeri 2002</LINK>), but there is otherwise little indication in these studies of the pathways through which case management may improve outcomes. The small number of studies does not allow any firm conclusions about case management but case management models should be priorities for further research.</P>
<P>The outcomes for other setting of care and organization of care interventions demonstrated mixed results. Multidisciplinary or multi-faceted treatment was associated with increased ARV use by pregnant women in two studies, but not in a third study, and with decreased hospitalization in one study. Health care information systems were not associated with mortality or hospital admission in one study but in the same study computer alerts and reminders for primary care physicians appeared to increase the initiation of ARVs and indicated prophylaxis. Evening and weekend clinic hours were associated with decreased hospitalization rates in one study but another study did not find that relationship with increased hours. It is difficult to draw conclusions for practice from these results but there are enough promising findings to indicate that multidisciplinary and multi-faceted treatments, health information systems and hours of operation should be considered when designing health services and should be research priorities.</P>
<P>The relationship between interventions and health care utilization outcomes was mixed. The only finding that was consistent across multiple studies was decreased ER use in high volume settings (two studies). Interventions that could be considered promising but which were found in only one study each included improved entry and continuity in appropriate medical care with a social services case manager, increased primary medical care visits in a multifaceted ancillary services group, decreased length of hospital stay with discharge information to GPs from and 24/7 phone access to an infectious diseases specialist and a decrease in ER visits in relation to evening and weekend clinic hours and the availability of an on-call physician.</P>
<P>This systematic review has several important limitations including the limited number of studies examining each intervention and outcome, the observational design of most available studies, the possibility of residual confounding being responsible for study results, the lack of ability to perform a meta-analyses due to heterogeneous populations, interventions and outcomes, and the lack of detailed descriptions of many interventions. None of the studies in this review were conducted in resource-poor settings. It may be difficult for policy makers to replicate the setting and/or organization of care in these settings due to the large differences that exist between industrialized and developing world healthcare infrastructures. </P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>Implications for practice and policy</P>
<P>Policy makers and clinicians are faced with a serious gap in evidence about the characteristics of settings that are most effective for HIV/AIDS care and ways in which services should be organized to maximize beneficial outcomes. Existing studies suggest that centralizing care in high concentration high volume centres could lead to improved outcomes including mortality. Unfortunately, this evidence is mixed and is limited to developed country settings. Appropriate care settings in resource poor countries, especially those with large rural populations, cannot be determined from the available evidence. Case management may also associated with improved outcomes but the limited number of studies and the varying definitions of case management leave considerable doubt about how best to implement such programs. Multidisciplinary and multi-faceted treatments, health information systems and extended hours of operation are promising interventions but evidence about their effectiveness is so far lacking.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Whether to centralize care in regional centres or distribute it in the community and what types of health care workers and teams are best able to provide effective care are key questions in the organization of HIV/AIDS care, especially in developing countries. We did not identify sufficient evidence to guide these decisions. Concentration of hospitalized patients and hospital, ward and clinic volume require further research, as does the effectiveness of case management, the use of multidisciplinary teams and multi-faceted interventions, the use of health information systems, hours of operation and other aspects of care settings and organization of care. </P>
<P>Investigators should aim to have control groups whenever possible, to describe interventions fully, to develop common terminology about teams and case management and to measure and control for differences in case mix, age, sex, route of transmission, ethnicity, and insurance status when relevant. </P>
