<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2011-04-23 21:59:43 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Fractures (breaks) of the humerus are commonly treated without an operation. The indications for surgery are not completely clear, but often include open fractures (fractures exposed to contamination through the skin) or unstable fractures such as segmental fractures (where there are two or more fractures in the same bone with a free fragment in between).</P>
<P>When an operation is needed the choice is usually between a plate or an intramedullary nail. Plating is achieved by exposing the fracture site, fixing a plate to the bone and securing it with screws. Intramedullary nailing is performed through small cuts in the skin. The nail is inserted to lie within the central cavity of the bone through a carefully prepared hole, usually at the top end of the humerus. Locking screws in both ends may be used to further stabilize the nail.</P>
<P>Five poor quality trials were included in this review. These involved a total of 260 participants who were randomly assigned to having their humerus fractures fixed with either a plate or a nail. Both nailing and plating had similar fracture union rates. Compared with plating, nailing was associated with an increased risk of shoulder impingement involving shoulder pain and restrictions in shoulder range of movement. Usually because of impingement, nails had to be removed more frequently than plates. The limited available evidence did not show important differences between the two surgical methods in the other outcomes reported by one or more trials. These outcomes included nerve injury, infection, healing time, operating time, blood loss and return to pre-injury occupation. </P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2011-04-23 21:24:28 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Five small trials comparing dynamic compression plates with locked intramedullary nailing were included in this review. These involved a total of 260 participants undergoing surgery for either acute fractures or after early failure of conservative treatment. All five trials had methodological flaws, such as the lack of assessor blinding, that could have influenced their findings. There was no significant difference in fracture union between plating and nailing (five trials, RR 1.05; 95% CI 0.97 to 1.13). There was a statistically significant increase in shoulder impingement following nailing when compared with plating (five trials, RR 0.12; 95% CI 0.04 to 0.38). Intramedullary nails were removed significantly more frequently than plates (three trials, RR 0.17; 95% CI 0.04 to 0.76). There was no statistically significant difference between plating and nailing in operating time, blood loss during surgery, iatrogenic radial nerve injury, return to pre-injury occupation by six months or American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) scores.</P>
<P>Two further small trials are awaiting classification.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2011-04-22 23:02:42 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The available evidence shows that intramedullary nailing is associated with an increased risk of shoulder impingement, with a related increase in restriction of shoulder movement and need for removal of metalwork. There was insufficient evidence to determine if there were any other important differences, including in functional outcome, between dynamic compression plating and locked intramedullary nailing for humeral shaft fractures.</P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2011-05-03 22:14:51 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Lindsey Elstub">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2011-04-23 21:48:03 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2009-02-25 06:26:16 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Fractures of the humerus (upper arm bone) are divided according to site of injury into fractures of the proximal humerus, the shaft of the humerus and the distal humerus. Fractures of the shaft (the middle part of the bone) of the humerus account for approximately 3% of all fractures in adults (<LINK REF="REF-Zuckerman-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zuckerman 1996</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2011-04-23 21:41:55 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Most fractures of the shaft of the humerus are managed nonoperatively (<LINK REF="REF-Sarmiento-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sarmiento 2000</LINK>). Non-operative or conservative treatment may involve the use of casts, functional braces or supervised neglect. Initial or primary surgical treatment is generally indicated for open, segmental or pathological fractures. It is also often considered for bilateral fractures, associated forearm fractures on the same side, poly-trauma, progressive neurological deficit, vascular injury and failed non-surgical treatment leading to delayed or non-union (<LINK REF="REF-Mulier-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mulier 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>Where primary surgical management of humeral shaft fractures is undertaken, it is presently unclear which of the different surgical options is the best. Surgical fixation of a fracture of the shaft of humerus can be achieved by plating, nailing or by external fixation. External fixation is generally indicated for temporary stabilisation of open fractures or in persons with poly-trauma. Plating or intramedullary nailing are the main surgical options available for the management of closed humeral shaft fractures. This review compares the two more commonly used interventions: dynamic compression plating and locked intramedullary nailing.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2011-04-23 21:48:03 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Plate fixation when combined with open reduction, which provides direct fracture visualisation, allows anatomical reduction and rigid fracture fixation (using dynamic compression plates). Intramedullary nails can be either flexible or rigid and locked or not. Flexible nails are not locked but rigid nails are locked at both proximal and distal ends. Nailing is performed by exposing either the upper or lower end of the humerus away from the fracture site and inserting the nail into the medullary canal from the top of the shoulder (antegrade nail) or the bottom (retrograde nail). The nail is then stabilised by interlocking screws in both ends. A statically locked nail (a nail with interlocking screws at either end for rotational stability) provides good rigidity against torsional forces, maintains length and preserves soft tissues at the fracture site. The aim of all currently used fixation systems is stable fixation, allowing early mobilisation and shortened recovery. Both treatment methods have technique-specific complications.</P>
<P>Conservative treatment of humeral shaft fractures achieves union in a great majority of persons. However some people with closed humeral shaft fractures undergoing conservative treatment may not achieve fracture union and will require late surgery. The prognosis and complications in persons who have surgical fixation for established non-union will be different from persons in whom surgery was the primary treatment option.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2011-04-22 21:16:29 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The preferred technique for surgical stabilisation is controversial, with arguments for and against both treatment modalities (<LINK REF="REF-Pickering-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pickering 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sarmiento-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sarmiento 2002</LINK>). This review set out to examine the available evidence from randomised trials comparing these two treatment options in order to see if this would inform practice.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2011-04-23 22:07:02 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Included in this review are five small trials, involving a total of 260 participants, that compared dynamic compression plates with locked intramedullary nailing. Although all studies included only humeral shaft fractures, the indication for surgery was heterogenous, including both open and closed fractures and surgery for acute fractures as well as for early failure of initial conservative treatment. Individually, no trial provided conclusive evidence in favour of either intervention. However, only very limited data were available for functional outcomes. There were insufficient data available to carry out the intended subgroup analysis relating to the timing of surgery.</P>
<P>Pooled data showed a statistically significant increase in shoulder impingement and restriction of shoulder range of movement following nailing compared with plating. Additionally, the need for metalwork removal was significantly less when plates were used. Nails were usually removed following fracture union in order to treat shoulder impingement. Pooled data for fracture union, iatrogenic radial nerve injury, intraoperative fracture comminution and infection did not result in statistically significant findings in favour of one of the two implants. The limited data available for functional outcomes, including the ability to return to pre-injury occupation and functional shoulder scores, showed similar results for the two implants.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2011-04-22 22:48:41 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In view of limited pooling and small sample size, our confidence in the applicability of the evidence is not high. There was notable heterogeneity in the study populations, both in terms of open and closed fractures and timing of surgery, including surgical fixation after early failure of initial conservative treatment. Although all of the included trials reported on fracture union, iatrogenic radial nerve injury and shoulder impingement uncertainty remains regarding a number of clinically relevant and patient reported outcome measures. Overall, the available evidence does not indicate the superiority of either implant although it is not clear if outcomes differ in open versus closed fractures or in early versus delayed surgery. This latter reflects an important limitation of the evidence given the anticipated differences in outcome between surgery for acute fractures and non-union.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2011-04-22 22:50:13 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The overall quality of evidence was low. <LINK REF="STD-Bolano-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Bolano 1995</LINK> presented their findings at a conference but never published the full results of their trial. The main conference abstract provided very limited data on study methodology, and there were discrepancies between the abstract reports of this trial. The method of random sequence generation was not stated in any trials, and insufficient details were provided to confirm adequate concealment of allocation. Variation in the timing of follow-up was a potential source of bias and intention-to-treat analysis was not confirmed in any of the trials. There was no independent or blinded assessment of outcome. We consider that the above factors could have significantly influenced outcome.</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2011-04-23 22:28:17 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Our review was conducted according to the methodology set out in the published protocol. As such it is unlikely that the review was unduly influenced by the available evidence. In spite of a thorough search we identified only one trial published in a non-English language and it is possible that despite our efforts we might have missed other potentially suitable studies. However, our date of last search pertaining to the full processing of included trials was December 2008, and a subsequent search update identified two more recently published small trials (<LINK REF="STD-Putti-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Putti 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Singisetti-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Singisetti 2010</LINK>) that are likely to contribute data in a future update.</P>
<P>Reflecting the mixed populations of some of the included trials, we expanded the scope of the review to include early fracture fixation following failed conservative treatment. This was a pragmatic decision and given the differences between surgery for acute fracture and non-union, we recognise the frustration of some readers of this review that a subgroup analysis by timing of surgery could not be done.</P>

<P>We found three previous systematic reviews. <LINK REF="REF-Bhandari-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bhandari 2006</LINK> included three trials and found that plate fixation may reduce the risk of reoperation and shoulder impingement.

<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Li-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Li 2006</LINK> included three studies: <LINK REF="STD-Chapman-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Chapman 2000</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Chiu-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Chiu 1997</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-McCormack-2000" TYPE="STUDY">McCormack 2000</LINK>. As mentioned above, <LINK REF="STD-Chiu-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Chiu 1997</LINK> is excluded from our review. No useful additional information was available from this review.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2011-04-22 23:01:52 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The available evidence shows that intramedullary nailing is associated with an increased risk of shoulder impingement, with a related increase in restriction of shoulder movement and need for removal of metalwork. There was insufficient evidence to determine if there were any other important differences, including in functional outcome, between dynamic compression plating and locked intramedullary nailing for humeral shaft fractures.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2011-04-21 21:50:03 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Further trials comparing currently used methods of plating and nailing for humeral fractures are required. Researchers should ensure adequate randomisation and allocation concealment and blind outcome assessors. Trial methodology should be well-reported (<LINK REF="REF-Moher-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 2010</LINK>). We suggest that future research should use validated measures of shoulder and elbow function as well as patient satisfaction, return to work, adverse effects and hospital stay, with follow-up of at least one year. Fracture union, delayed union and non-union should be clearly defined and assessed independently. Researchers should also allow for subgroup comparisons (open versus closed fractures, immediate versus delayed surgery, and bone graft versus no bone graft).</P>

<P>The outcome measures were classified as primary outcomes and secondary outcomes in the protocol. The secondary outcomes have been subdivided in the review into operative details, perioperative complications, postoperative complications and final outcomes for ease of discussion and presentation of results. We added four new secondary outcome measures to the ones listed in the protocol. These are operating time, blood loss, intra-operative fracture comminution and ASES score. Blood loss and intraoperative fracture comminution come under perioperative complications listed in the protocol.</P>
<P>The 'Data collection and analysis' section has been adapted to reflect the actual conduct of the review, and revised guidance such as the assessment of threshold values for the I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic.</P>
<P>Since the publication of our protocol, we revised the approach to scoring for the quality assessment tool and no longer calculate total scores.</P>
<P>We did not plan any sensitivity analysis in the protocol but subsequently felt that sensitivity analysis to investigate the role of autogenous bone graft in fracture union would be useful. We will consider the need for further sensitivity analyses in our update.</P>
