<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2008-09-17 15:04:06 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Restricting oxygen supplementation significantly reduces the rate and severity of vision problems (retinopathy) in premature and low birth weight babies. Babies born either prematurely (before 37 weeks) or with a low birth weight often have breathing problems and need extra oxygen. Oxygen supplementation has provided many benefits for these babies but can cause damage to the eyes (retinopathy) and lungs. The review of trials found that unrestricted oxygen supplementation has these potential adverse effects without any clear benefits. Restricted oxygen significantly reduces these risks. More research is needed to find the best level of oxygen supplementation.</P>

<P>While the use of supplemental oxygen has a long history in neonatal care, resulting in both significant health care benefits and harms, uncertainty remains as to the most appropriate range to target blood oxygen levels in preterm and low birth weight infants.

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-11-06 15:40:51 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The administration of supplemental oxygen has a long history in neonatal care (<LINK REF="REF-Wilson-1942" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wilson 1942</LINK>). The use of oxygen in preterm and low birth weight infants suffering respiratory insufficiency has resulted in significant health care benefits, such as reduced mortality and spastic diplegia (<LINK REF="REF-Avery-1960" TYPE="REFERENCE">Avery 1960</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McDonald-1963" TYPE="REFERENCE">McDonald 1963</LINK>), but has also been associated with significant deleterious effects such as retinopathy of prematurity and lung toxicity (<LINK REF="REF-Duc-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Duc 1992</LINK>).</P>
<P>Improvements in technology in the past few decades have led to both the increased survival of preterm and low birth weight infants and an ability to measure their oxygen levels more accurately. Despite the exceedingly common use of supplemental oxygen in this population of infants, there is little consensus as to the optimal mode of administration and appropriate levels of oxygen for maximising short or long-term growth and development, while minimising harmful effects (<LINK REF="REF-Poets-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Poets 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McIntosh-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">McIntosh 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>Uncertainty remains as to the most appropriate range to target blood oxygen levels in preterm and low birth weight infants. Usher (<LINK REF="STD-Usher-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Usher 1973</LINK>) examined the effect of targeting a lower vs. higher range of PaO<SUB>2</SUB> on death, the need for mechanical ventilation and other clinical outcomes and concluded there was no benefit in targeting a higher range, and there may in fact be deleterious respiratory effects (<LINK REF="REF-Coates-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Coates 1982</LINK>). A cohort study by Tin et al (<LINK REF="REF-Tin-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tin 2001</LINK>) also suggested an increase in adverse respiratory outcomes and a significant increase in the incidence of ROP occurred when higher oxygen ranges were targeted in preterm infants. However, Phelps and Rosenbaum (<LINK REF="REF-Phelps-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Phelps 1984</LINK>) demonstrated significantly more severe retinopathy in kittens recovering from hyperoxic-induced disease when allowed to recover in lower levels of ambient oxygen, suggesting that targeting higher blood oxygen levels may be beneficial to visual outcomes. The STOP-ROP trial (<LINK REF="STD-STOP_x002d_ROP-2000" TYPE="STUDY">STOP-ROP 2000</LINK>) found that higher oxygen targeting did not significantly decrease the incidence of pre-threshold ROP progression, but did cause an exacerbation of adverse pulmonary events. The results of this trial are included in a separate Cochrane review entitled: "Supplemental oxygen for the treatment of pre-threshold retinopathy of prematurity" (<LINK REF="REF-Lloyd-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lloyd 2003</LINK>). The effects of either policy of oxygen administration on long-term growth and development in preterm or low birth weight infants remains uncertain.</P>
<P>Two related Cochrane reviews have summarised the findings on gradual vs. abrupt (<LINK REF="REF-Askie-2001a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Askie 2001a</LINK>) and early vs. late discontinuation of oxygen therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Askie-2001b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Askie 2001b</LINK>) in preterm or low birth weight infants.</P>

<P>The standard search strategy of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group was used. This includes searches of the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (CENTRAL/CCTR, The Cochrane Library, Issue 2, 2008), the Oxford Database of Perinatal trials, MEDLINE, previous reviews including cross references, abstracts, conferences and symposia proceedings, expert informants, journal hand searching mainly in the English language.</P>
<P>An additional literature search, using OVID software, was conducted of the MEDLINE (1996 - June, Week 2, 2008), Maternity and Infant Care (1971 - June 2008), and CINAHL (1982 - June 2008) databases in order to locate any trials in addition to those provided by the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (CENTRAL/CCTR, The Cochrane Library, Issue 2, 2008). The search strategy involved various combinations of the following keywords, using the search fields of abstract, MeSH subject heading, exploded subject heading, floating subject heading, publication type, registry number word, subject heading word, text word, and title: oxygen, preterm, premature, neonate, newborn, infant, oxygen saturation, hypoxia, retinopathy of prematurity, retrolental fibroplasia, low birth weight, very low birth weight, extremely low birth weight, randomized controlled trial, controlled clinical trial, clinical trial, random allocation, placebo.</P>

<P>The standard methods of the Cochrane Collaboration and its Neonatal Review Group were used to select trials, assess quality and extract and synthesise data. For each trial, each author independently assessed the methodological quality and extracted the data from the report. Results were compared and differences resolved as required. Level of agreement between the two authors was greater than 90% in all cases. Eligible trials were assessed for the degree of selection, performance, attrition and detection bias. Additional information was requested from authors to clarify methodology or results as necessary.</P>
<P>Meta-analyses were carried out with use of relative risk (RR) and risk difference (RD). When appropriate, number needed to treat (1/RD) was calculated. The fixed effects "assumption free" model was used. Evaluation of heterogeneity, subgroup and sensitivity analyses were undertaken as appropriate.</P>

<P>The systematic review located six trials that addressed the question of targeting oxygen administration in preterm/LBW infants. Fourteen other studies were excluded from the analysis as they either did not address this particular question or did not involve random allocation of one of the interventions under review.</P>
<P>
<B>Participants:</B>
</P>
<P>The enrolment period for five included studies was between 1951 - 1969 (referred to as "pre-1990" trials or studies hereon in) and one (<LINK REF="STD-Askie-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Askie 2003</LINK>) included study was conducted between 1996 -2000 (referred to as "post-1990" trials or studies hereon in). The five pre-1990 studies were done during an early era of neonatal care, with therapies and practices quite different from modern "intensive" care. These studies included only small numbers of survivors with birth weights under 1000 g, the infants who carry the greatest mortality and morbidity burden today. There was a wide range of birth weights among trial participants, from less than 1000 to 2500 g. The largest pre-1990 era trial (<LINK REF="STD-Kinsey-1956" TYPE="STUDY">Kinsey 1956</LINK>) only enrolled infants who survived beyond 48 hours, while the other four trials randomized infants on admission to the neonatal nursery anywhere from two hrs (<LINK REF="STD-Usher-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Usher 1973</LINK>) to &gt; 48 hours (<LINK REF="STD-Kinsey-1956" TYPE="STUDY">Kinsey 1956</LINK>). Infants from these five trials have been categorised as belonging to the early neonatal period (&lt; 1 week postnatal age), which was defined as treatments starting at &lt; 1 week of age. The only post-1990 trial (<LINK REF="STD-Askie-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Askie 2003</LINK>) enrolled infants &lt; 30 weeks gestation who remained dependent on supplemental oxygen at 32 weeks postmenstrual age; therefore, infants in this trial were at least three weeks postnatal age at randomization. Infants in this trial have been defined in this review as belonging to the later neonatal period (&#8805; 3 weeks postnatal age). The five pre-1990 trials used birth weight as inclusion criteria, with the most recent trial using gestational and postmenstrual age as inclusion criteria. Three trials also selected infants for inclusion based on a diagnosis of respiratory distress syndrome (<LINK REF="STD-Usher-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Usher 1973</LINK>) or hypoxia/acidemia (<LINK REF="STD-Sinclair-1968" TYPE="STUDY">Sinclair 1968</LINK>) or continued dependence on supplemental oxygen more than three weeks after birth (<LINK REF="STD-Askie-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Askie 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<B>Intervention:</B>
</P>
<P>Three trials (<LINK REF="STD-Askie-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Askie 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Usher-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Usher 1973</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sinclair-1968" TYPE="STUDY">Sinclair 1968</LINK>) administered oxygen based on actual arterial, saturation or capillary blood oxygen levels. The other three trials were conducted in an era before accurate blood oxygen monitoring in infants was possible. As such, these trials could only test the effects of cruder measures of oxygenation, such as ambient oxygen concentration, and even these in only general terms, labelled "liberal" and "restricted" oxygen administration in this review.

<P>Five of the included trials started the intervention in the early neonatal period (&lt; 1 week postnatal age), but continued it for a wide range of time; from one day to seven weeks. Of these, four studies randomized infants from birth (defined as <U>&lt;</U> 48 hours after birth) (<LINK REF="STD-Lanman-1954" TYPE="STUDY">Lanman 1954</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Patz-1954" TYPE="STUDY">Patz 1954</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sinclair-1968" TYPE="STUDY">Sinclair 1968</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Usher-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Usher 1973</LINK>), while one study did not randomize infants until &gt; 48 hours after birth (<LINK REF="STD-Kinsey-1956" TYPE="STUDY">Kinsey 1956</LINK>). One trial started the intervention in the later neonatal period (from 32 weeks postmenstrual age) (<LINK REF="STD-Askie-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Askie 2003</LINK>), and continued for a median of 17.5 days (IQR 7.0 to 41.0 days) for lower oxygen targeting and a median of 40.0 days (IQR 20.5 to 73.0 days) for the higher oxygen targeting group. When oxygen weaning was indicated, it was done so gradually in two trials, abruptly in one trial, and the method not specified in the remaining three trials.</P>

<B>Outcomes:</B>
</P>
<P>Outcome measures were assessed at time periods ranging from two days to 12 months. Only <LINK REF="STD-Askie-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Askie 2003</LINK> reported the longer term (12 months corrected age) effects of the interventions on growth, neurodevelopment, lung function, or chronic lung disease. <LINK REF="REF-Coates-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Coates 1982</LINK> reported some long-term outcomes on infants from Usher's 1973 study (<LINK REF="STD-Usher-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Usher 1973</LINK>). Unfortunately, he was only able to obtain outcome data for 23% of survivors, and in keeping with our <I>a priori</I> specification of only including outcome measures with 80% or greater ascertainment, these data are not included in the review.</P>
<P>Only one study (<LINK REF="STD-Askie-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Askie 2003</LINK>) reporting eye outcome data used the International Classification of Retinopathy of Prematurity grading system (<LINK REF="REF-ROP-Committee-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">ROP Committee 1984</LINK>). This was assessed by routine ophthalmic examinations at two-week intervals from enrolment until the resolution of retinopathy.</P>
<P>The only other study to report eye outcome data used the retrolental fibroplasia (RLF) classifications (<LINK REF="REF-Reese-1953" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reese 1953</LINK>). Vascular RLF grade 1, vascular RLF grade 2, and cicatricial RLF / RLF grade 3 correspond approximately with retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) stage 3, ROP stage 4, and ROP stage 5 / blindness respectively. These inferred classifications were gathered from references to RLF/ROP cross-classification from the International Classification of Retinopathy of Prematurity system (<LINK REF="REF-ROP-Committee-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">ROP Committee 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-ROP-Committee-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">ROP Committee 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Garner-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Garner 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hindle-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hindle 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hindle-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hindle 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sira-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sira 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Szewcyk-1953" TYPE="REFERENCE">Szewcyk 1953</LINK>). Ascertainment of RLF in the five trials from 1951 - 1969 was by direct ophthalmoscope, visualising the posterior pole only. The only findings that could be identified using this method were dilation and tortuosity of the retinal vessels ("plus disease", using the 1984 and 1987 classifications, as above). The more common findings in the anterior pole that can today be identified with indirect ophthalmoscopy were unable to be identified. Hence, even the least severe eye outcomes reported in this review equate with what today would be described as "threshold" ROP.</P>
<P>The largest trial (<LINK REF="STD-Askie-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Askie 2003</LINK>, n = 358) only enrolled infants who survived and were oxygen dependent beyond three weeks postnatal age. The second largest trial (<LINK REF="STD-Kinsey-1956" TYPE="STUDY">Kinsey 1956</LINK>, n = 212) only enrolled infants who survived beyond 48 hours. Unfortunately, the third largest trial (<LINK REF="STD-Patz-1954" TYPE="STUDY">Patz 1954</LINK>, n = unknown, but greater than 120) did not report any mortality data and these data are not retrievable (<LINK REF="REF-Duc-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Duc 1992</LINK>).</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">RESTRICTED VS. LIBERAL OXYGEN THERAPY (ALL PRETERM/LBW INFANTS) IN EARLY NEONATAL PERIOD (Comparison 1):</HEADING>
<P>In this meta-analysis, restricted compared with liberal oxygen administration when started during the early neonatal period did not have any statistically significant effect on the incidence of death. It should be noted that there were a range of times for enrolment in this early period from two hrs (<LINK REF="STD-Usher-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Usher 1973</LINK>) to &gt; 48 hrs (<LINK REF="STD-Kinsey-1956" TYPE="STUDY">Kinsey 1956</LINK>). However, restricted oxygen administration did significantly reduce the incidence of all forms of retrolental fibroplasia (RLF) in survivors. Cicatricial RLF (any grade) was significantly reduced in surviving infants who were exposed to a restricted oxygen regime (summary RR 0.26, 95% CI 0.11-0.58). There was also a significant reduction in the precursor, vascular RLF (any stage), in surviving infants exposed to restricted oxygen (summary RR 0.34, 95% CI CI 0.25-0.46).</P>
<P>During the early neonatal period, neither restricted compared with liberal oxygen administration nor lower vs. higher blood oxygen levels (where blood oxygen was directly measured) had significant independent effects on death rates, either in all preterm/LBW infants or in a sub-group of infants with birth weights &lt; 1250 g. However, restricted compared with liberal oxygen administration did significantly reduce a combined measure of adverse outcome, death or RLF (vascular, any stage) (summary RR 0.59, 95% CI 0.48-0.72). Thus, one would need to treat only three infants with restricted oxygen to prevent one infant from having the adverse outcome of death or RLF (NNT = 1/RD = 1/0.310 = 3.2). Restricted compared with liberal oxygen administration also reduced the more severe measure of adverse outcome, death or RLF (cicatricial, any grade) (summary RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.56-1.07) for the trial where the intervention was used in the early neonatal period, although this result was not statistically significant.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">SUBGROUP ANALYSIS FOR THE EARLY NEONATAL PERIOD (Comparisons 2-4):</HEADING>
<P>Only one of the <I>a priori</I> stated subgroup analyses was possible with the available data for the early neonatal period.</P>
<P>Subgroup analysis of lower vs. higher blood oxygen levels in the early neonatal period showed that for infants with BW &lt; 1250 g weeks gestational age, there was no significant difference in the incidence of death. However, it should be noted that this trial (<LINK REF="STD-Usher-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Usher 1973</LINK>) only enrolled 45 infants.The only reported effect of restricted vs. liberal oxygen saturation targeting on infants with birth weight less than 1000g was a non-significant decrease in RLF (cicatricial, severe) in the <LINK REF="STD-Patz-1954" TYPE="STUDY">Patz 1954</LINK> trial. The analysis was based on very small numbers, with uneven denominators in each group. This may reflect a difference in the number of survivors in the two groups resulting from deaths which were not accounted for by <LINK REF="STD-Patz-1954" TYPE="STUDY">Patz 1954</LINK>. This result should thus be interpreted with caution as the small numbers in this subgroup (as reflected in the wide confidence intervals) and non-reported deaths make any meaningful interpretation of these data difficult.</P>

<P>Only one study (<LINK REF="STD-Askie-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Askie 2003</LINK>), with 358 infants, contributed to the results in the later neonatal period. There was no significant difference in the incidence of death between lower or higher oxygen saturation targeting when started in the later neonatal period. There were no statistically significant differences in the incidence of ROP (any stage) in survivors, the incidence of ROP &gt; Stage 2 nor ROP Stage 4 or 5 or blindness between the infants receiving lower or higher oxygen saturation targeting. There were no statistically significant differences between intervention strategies for the combined outcomes of death or ROP &gt; Stage 2, nor with death or ROP Stage 4 or 5 or blindness.</P>
<P>Some outcome measures specified <I>a priori</I> as clinically meaningful were reported. There was no statistically significant difference in the incidence of major developmental abnormality at 12 months corrected age between lower or higher oxygen saturation targeting. In relation to lung function, there was a significant reduction on the dependence of supplemental oxygen at 36 weeks of postmenstrual age with using a lower oxygen saturation target (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.59-0.87). There was no statistically significant difference between interventions for the incidence of use of postnatal corticosteroids and diuretics for chronic lung disease with the use of either a lower or higher oxygen saturation targeting.</P>

<P>
<U>Evaluation of heterogeneity:</U>
</P>
<P>No statistical heterogeneity was demonstrated in any of the outcome measures analysed that included more than one trial.</P>
<P>There was considerable clinical heterogeneity amongst the six trials included in this review. All included trials contained a wide range of birth weights, followed infants for a relatively wide ranging period (and all but one in the short-term only), used different definitions of outcome measures (five trials used RLF and one trial used ROP eye outcome definitions), and implemented the interventions in either an early or later neonatal period. There was a very wide range of exposure to the interventions under review (1 day to &gt;10 weeks). Moreover, there were three distinct intervention comparisons included in the review (hence the division of comparisons into restricted vs. liberal oxygen administration in the early neonatal period, lower vs. higher blood oxygen levels in the early neonatal period, and lower vs. higher blood oxygen levels in the later neonatal period). The <LINK REF="STD-Kinsey-1956" TYPE="STUDY">Kinsey 1956</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Lanman-1954" TYPE="STUDY">Lanman 1954</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Patz-1954" TYPE="STUDY">Patz 1954</LINK> trials were conducted in an early (pre-1990) era of neonatal care where methods of oxygen monitoring and administration were crude in comparison to today's techniques and thus only restricted vs. liberal oxygen administration could be compared in these trials. The <LINK REF="STD-Usher-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Usher 1973</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Sinclair-1968" TYPE="STUDY">Sinclair 1968</LINK> trials used more modern techniques (including umbilical artery catheterization, arterialised capillary sampling, micromethods for blood gases and acid-base), so comparison of lower vs. higher blood oxygen levels were possible with these data. The <LINK REF="STD-Askie-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Askie 2003</LINK> trial used pulse oximeters whose algorithm assessed functional oxygen saturation, and thus comparisons of lower vs. higher blood oxygen level via oxygen saturation targets were possible with data from these trials.</P>
<P>
<U>Sensitivity analyses:</U>
</P>
<P>The results of the meta-analyses were tested for robustness with regard to study quality. We had stated <I>a priori</I> that trials containing outcome measures with greater than 20% attrition would not be included in the analysis. In one trial, <LINK REF="STD-Patz-1954" TYPE="STUDY">Patz 1954</LINK>, it was unclear whether outcome ascertainment was complete as attrition due to losses to follow-up and deaths were not reported. This, plus the fact that it was the only trial using a quasi-random method of patient allocation, led us to test the results without the inclusion of this trial.</P>
<P>There were two outcome measures for the early neonatal period analysis that included data from the <LINK REF="STD-Patz-1954" TYPE="STUDY">Patz 1954</LINK> trial. The outcomes to which the Patz trial contributed were RLF (vascular, any stage) and RLF (cicatricial, severe grades). The results for neither of these outcome measures were significantly affected by the exclusion of the Patz trial. Hence, the results of these meta-analyses were not sensitive to the effect of study quality.</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2009-03-12 12:06:00 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The answer to the question of what is the optimal therapeutic range of blood oxygen level for preterm/LBW infants to maximise benefits, while minimising harms, remains uncertain.</P>
<P>To date only two randomized trials (<LINK REF="STD-Askie-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Askie 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Usher-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Usher 1973</LINK>) have attempted to address this question directly. <LINK REF="STD-Sinclair-1968" TYPE="STUDY">Sinclair 1968</LINK> assessed the effects of lower vs. higher blood oxygen levels and other co-interventions in a group of hypoxic, acidaemic low birth weight infants. The related, but now historic, question of restricted vs. liberal oxygen administration was addressed by three randomized trials (<LINK REF="STD-Kinsey-1956" TYPE="STUDY">Kinsey 1956</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lanman-1954" TYPE="STUDY">Lanman 1954</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Patz-1954" TYPE="STUDY">Patz 1954</LINK>) in an era before accurate and/or continuous monitoring of infant blood oxygen levels was possible. Both interventions were included in this review, which addresses the general question of the effect of oxygen dose on outcomes for preterm/LBW infants.</P>
<P>In this analysis, restricting oxygen exposure in the early neonatal period significantly reduced the incidence and severity of RLF without unduly increasing death rates. The results of the largest trial contributing to these outcomes (<LINK REF="STD-Kinsey-1956" TYPE="STUDY">Kinsey 1956</LINK>) have often been misinterpreted, with the resulting extrapolation of aggressive restriction of oxygen from birth leading to a substantial increase in mortality rates among preterm/LBW infants in the years following its publication (<LINK REF="REF-Cross-1973" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cross 1973</LINK>). This trial did not enrol infants until at least 48 hours of age. It should also be noted that the second largest trial, <LINK REF="STD-Patz-1954" TYPE="STUDY">Patz 1954</LINK>, did not report any mortality data and this information is not retrievable (<LINK REF="REF-Duc-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Duc 1992</LINK>). Unfortunately, the confidence intervals around the point estimate for this outcome are quite wide (RR 1.20, 95% CI 0.80-1.80), and the addition of the <LINK REF="STD-Patz-1954" TYPE="STUDY">Patz 1954</LINK> mortality data would have been helpful in resolving this issue. It is possible that the difference in RLF rates seen in survivors may be influenced by the trend toward excess deaths caused by the restricted oxygen policy.</P>
<P>Since the publication of these earlier era trials, other authors have attempted to further investigate the association between RLF/ROP and blood oxygen levels. A large, prospective, non-randomized study (<LINK REF="REF-Kinsey-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kinsey 1977</LINK>) involving a detailed survey across five collaborating centres in the USA was undertaken between 1969 and 1972. No definitive relationship between blood oxygen levels and the occurrence of RLF could be established. It should be noted that this analysis was undertaken using the limited information available from intermittent blood gas sampling. The study did find an association between susceptibility to RLF and decreasing birth weight and increasing time in oxygen. However, no guidelines for the optimal range of blood oxygen level were suggested by this study.</P>
<P>Two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Sinclair-1968" TYPE="STUDY">Sinclair 1968</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Usher-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Usher 1973</LINK>) that addressed the question of low vs. higher blood oxygen levels in the early neonatal period (&lt; 1 week postnatal age) found no significant effect on death in the early neonatal period, but did not report (in sufficient detail to warrant inclusion) the effect of this intervention on eye or other outcomes. The effects of either of these oxygen administration policies on other clinically meaningful outcomes, including chronic lung disease, long-term growth, neurodevelopment, lung or visual function were not reported.</P>
<P>No further trials were undertaken until a prospective, multicenter, double-blind, randomized, controlled trial (<LINK REF="STD-Askie-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Askie 2003</LINK>) involving eight collaborating centres in Australia was conducted between 1996 and 2000. There were no significant differences in the rates of ROP at any stage between the lower and higher oxygen saturation target groups in the later neonatal period (&#8805; 3 weeks postnatal age). There were no significant differences between the groups in mortality rates either. However, this study noted that there was a disadvantage to using higher oxygen saturation targeting because of the increase in the proportion of infants needing oxygen therapy for longer, as well as supplemental oxygen after discharge. Again, this study made no recommendations for an optimal blood oxygen level, but suggested that targeting higher blood oxygen levels may increase the burden of health services for these infants. This trial enrolled oxygen-dependent infants at 32 weeks postmenstrual age who were at least 3 weeks of age. There is therefore a need to evaluate this therapy when commenced soon after birth as this may alter the rates of ROP or death. A number of trials currently underway are examining this (<LINK REF="STD-BOOST-NZ-_x0028_NZ_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">BOOST NZ (NZ)</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-BOOSTII-_x0028_Australia_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">BOOSTII (Australia)</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-BOOSTII-_x0028_UK_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">BOOSTII (UK)</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-COT-_x0028_Canada_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">COT (Canada)</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-SUPPORT-_x0028_USA_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">SUPPORT (USA)</LINK>).</P>
<P>All studies included in this review measured eye outcomes. Unlike the pre-1990 studies, the <LINK REF="STD-Askie-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Askie 2003</LINK> trial also reported the effect of interventions on growth and development. However, these outcomes were not measured beyond 12 months corrected age and thus studies with longer term outcomes will need to be conducted. Since 2001, several observational studies (<LINK REF="REF-Tin-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tin 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Anderson-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anderson 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sun-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sun 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Chow-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chow 2003</LINK>) have been published that have suggested short-term ophthalmic and respiratory outcomes might be significantly improved by a policy of lower oxygen range targeting without causing increases in mortality or long-term morbidity. However, these non-randomized studies lack adequate statistical power to exclude possible small, but important, increases in death and disability that could have major implications if a policy of lower oxygen targeting was implemented worldwide. Currently, there are five ongoing randomized trials being conducted to assess the effects of lower vs. higher oxygen saturation levels in extremely preterm infants from birth. The individual patient data from these trials will be combined in a prospective meta-analysis to help resolve this remaining question.</P>
<P>The role of careful, continuous monitoring of oxygen levels on the incidence of retinopathy of prematurity has also been investigated by several authors since the publication of the earlier studies included in this review. Bancalari and co-workers (<LINK REF="REF-Bancalari-1987a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bancalari 1987a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bancalari-1987b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bancalari 1987b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Flynn-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Flynn 1987</LINK>) conducted the only large randomized trial of continuous transcutaneous PO<SUB>2</SUB> monitoring to date. This study showed no significant difference in the incidence or severity of ROP, mortality or chronic lung disease in the continuously monitored infants compared with those who received standard (intermittent) monitoring of PO<SUB>2</SUB> levels. The utility of pulse oximetry monitoring in preventing adverse neonatal outcomes remains largely untested. The value of pulse oximetry in reducing major hypoxic events during anaesthesia among 152 children undergoing surgery has been assessed in one study (<LINK REF="REF-Cote-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cote 1988</LINK>). Another trial (<LINK REF="REF-Watkin-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Watkin 1999</LINK>) compared near infrared spectroscopy and pulse oximetry in the detection of hypoxaemia in neonates with pauses in nasal airflow. Roemer and colleagues (<LINK REF="REF-Roemer-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roemer 2005</LINK>) examined the diagnostic power of pulse oximetry, other blood oxygen measures and acid-base measurements for hypoxia in term fetuses. However, randomized controlled trial evidence for the effectiveness of pulse oximetry monitoring in the early neonatal period is still unavailable.</P>

<P>As the question of what is the optimal target range for maintaining blood oxygen levels remains unclear, further research should be undertaken to resolve this important clinical question. An ongoing international collaboration is attempting to address this issue. The BOOSTII trials (<LINK REF="STD-BOOST-NZ-_x0028_NZ_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">BOOST NZ (NZ)</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-BOOSTII-_x0028_Australia_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">BOOSTII (Australia)</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-BOOSTII-_x0028_UK_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">BOOSTII (UK)</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-COT-_x0028_Canada_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">COT (Canada)</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-SUPPORT-_x0028_USA_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">SUPPORT (USA)</LINK>) are all assessing the effects of higher oxygen levels on infants 27 weeks or less gestational age in terms of both short and long-term outcomes. Results from these trials will be combined in a prospective meta-analysis (known as the NeOProM Collaboration) and will be incorporated into this systematic review as they become available. The STOP-ROP trial (<LINK REF="STD-STOP_x002d_ROP-2000" TYPE="STUDY">STOP-ROP 2000</LINK>) assessed the effect of higher oxygen levels on the progression of pre-threshold ROP. The results of this trial are included in a separate Cochrane review entitled: "Supplemental oxygen for the treatment of pre-threshold retinopathy of prematurity" (Lloyd J, Askie LM, Smith J, Tarnow-Mordi WO). It should be noted that this trial did not address the effect of oxygen levels administered in the early neonatal period either as infants were 35.6 weeks postmenstrual age at enrolment into this trial.</P>

<P>Askie and Henderson-Smart developed the original protocol for this review, as well as doing the original literature searching, background, data analysis, discussion and conclusions. Askie and Henderson-Smart also contributed to the updated version of the review. Ko updated the review with an updated literature search, background with RLF/ROP cross-classification information and references, data analysis with the new included trial, updated the discussion and conclusions, updated the information on the ongoing clinical trials, and created the GRADE summary of findings tables which will be<BR/>included at a later date. Askie and Henderson-Smart reviewed this.</P>

<P>In the original protocol, visual function was to be recorded only in the first year of life, but in the review it was expanded to measure long-term visual function. The outcomes from long-term visual function observations fit well with the original protocol and subsequent review outcome measures of long-term growth and neurodevelopment.</P>
<P>In the current review, results have been split into observations made in the early neonatal period of life and the later neonatal period of life. This differentiation was not stated in the protocol. The splitting of the observations was due to the large time gap between when infants commenced the different oxygen strategies: either early in the neonatal period (&lt; 1 week) and later in the neonatal period (<U>&gt;</U> 3 weeks postnatal age).</P>
<P>As stated in the review, some long-term growth and development measures could not be measured due to no data being available for those outcomes.</P>
