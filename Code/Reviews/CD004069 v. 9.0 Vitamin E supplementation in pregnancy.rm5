<DESCRIPTION>
<P>There are now data available for over 21,000 women assessing the effects of vitamin E supplementation in combination with other supplements including vitamin C in pregnancy. The new data do not support routine vitamin E supplementation in combination with other agents for the prevention of stillbirth, neonatal death, preterm birth, pre-eclampsia, prelabour rupture of membranes or poor fetal growth. Supplementation was associated with a reduced risk of placental abruption. There was some evidence of harm, as vitamin E supplementation appeared to increase the risk of term prelabour rupture of membranes and self-reported abdominal pain. There were no clear differing patterns in the effects of vitamin E supplementation in subgroups of women based on the timing of commencement of supplementation or baseline risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes.</P>

<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2015-08-24 10:33:25 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Sonja L Henderson">
<P>
<B>What is the issue?</B>
</P>
<P>Does giving vitamin E supplementation, alone or in combination with other vitamins, given to women during pregnancy improve outcomes for their babies by reducing the incidence of pre-eclampsia and the number of babies born too early? Or does it cause harm?</P>
<P>
<B>Why is this important?</B>
</P>
<P>Although vitamin E deficiency is rarely seen in healthy adults, for pregnant women, insufficient dietary vitamin E (found in vegetable oils, nuts, cereals and some leafy green vegetables) may lead to complications such as pre-eclampsia and the baby being born small. In addition, vitamin E deficiency can be made worse by too much iron and so it is important to investigate the optimum amounts for pregnancy.</P>
<P>
<B>What evidence did we find?</B>
</P>
<P>This review included 21 trials involving over 21,000 women. Four trials did not contribute data to the analyses. The trials were generally of variable quality. There were just three studies on vitamin E supplementation alone, but none of these studies contributed data. All other studies included vitamin C, and additional supplements or drugs.</P>
<P>The findings indicate that routine supplementation with vitamin E in combination with other supplements during pregnancy did not improve outcomes for babies or women. There was a reduction in the number of placentas coming away early (placental abruption) in women given vitamin E supplements in combination with other agents, which was rated as high-quality evidence. However, it is unclear whether this finding was due to vitamin E or the other agents used in the supplement. This should be explored in further research examining the mechanisms leading to placental abruption.</P>
<P>The review found there may be harms associated with vitamin E supplements in pregnancy, as there was an increased risk of abdominal pain and term prelabour rupture of fetal membranes in women supplemented with vitamin E in combination with other supplements. There was no increase in preterm prelabour rupture of membranes in women supplemented with vitamin E and other agents.</P>
<P>
<B>What does this mean?</B>
</P>
<P>The large body of evidence does not support taking vitamin E supplements, alone or in combination, during pregnancy. This is because taking vitamin E in combination with other supplements during pregnancy does not help to prevent problems in pregnancy including stillbirth, baby death, preterm birth, pre-eclampsia or low birthweight babies. In fact, it may increase abdominal pain for women and also increase the number of women having early rupture of membranes at term.</P>

<P>Twenty-one trials, involving 22,129 women were eligible for this review. Four trials did not contribute data. All of the remaining 17 trials assessed vitamin E in combination with vitamin C and/or other agents. Overall the risk of bias ranged from low to unclear to high; 10 trials were judged to be at low risk of bias, six trials to be at unclear risk of bias and five trials to be at high risk of bias. No clear difference was found between women supplemented with vitamin E in combination with other supplements during pregnancy compared with placebo for the risk of stillbirth (risk ratio (RR) 1.17, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.88 to 1.56, nine studies, 19,023 participants, I = 0%; <I>moderate quality evidence</I>), neonatal death (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.13, nine trials, 18,617 participants, I = 0%), pre-eclampsia (average RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.06; 14 trials, 20,878 participants; I = 48%; <I>moderate quality evidence</I>), preterm birth (average RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.09, 11 trials, 20,565 participants, I = 52%; <I>high</I> <I>quality evidence</I>) or intrauterine growth restriction (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.06, 11 trials, 20,202 participants, I = 17%; <I>high</I> <I>quality evidence</I>). Women supplemented with vitamin E in combination with other supplements compared with placebo were at decreased risk of having a placental abruption (RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.44 to 0.93, seven trials, 14,922 participants, I = 0%; <I>high</I> <I>quality evidence</I>). Conversely, supplementation with vitamin E was associated with an increased risk of self-reported abdominal pain (RR 1.66, 95% CI 1.16 to 2.37, one trial, 1877 participants) and term prelabour rupture of membranes (PROM) (average RR 1.77, 95% CI 1.37 to 2.28, two trials, 2504 participants, I = 0%); however, there was no corresponding increased risk for preterm PROM (average RR 1.27, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.75, five trials, 1999 participants, I = 66%; <I>low quality evidence</I>). There were no clear differences between the vitamin E and placebo or control groups for any other maternal or infant outcomes. There were no clear differing patterns in subgroups of women based on the timing of commencement of supplementation or baseline risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes. The GRADE quality of the evidence was high for preterm birth, intrauterine growth restriction and placental abruption, moderate for stillbirth and clinical pre-eclampsia, and low for preterm PROM.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2015-08-24 10:48:53 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Sonja L Henderson">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2015-08-13 17:04:09 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>Vitamin E is the generic name given to eight lipid-soluble and plant-derived compounds; four are referred to as tocopherols (alpha, beta, gamma, delta) and four are known as tocotrienols (alpha, beta, gamma, delta) (<LINK REF="REF-Roberts-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roberts 1990</LINK>). Natural source alpha-tocopherol is the most biologically active form of vitamin E, and consequently vitamin E activity is expressed in terms of alpha-tocopherol equivalents (mg alpha-TE). In foods, the main source of tocopherol is wheatgerm oil and other vegetable oils, nuts, in the fat of meat, some cereals and some leafy green vegetables (<LINK REF="REF-NHMRC-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">NHMRC 2006</LINK>). Synthetic forms of vitamin E are also available and commonly used in vitamin preparations; however, these forms have less biological activity than their naturally occurring counterparts (<LINK REF="REF-IOM-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">IOM 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>Vitamin E deficiency is rarely seen in healthy adults and has primarily been characterised in preterm infants, low birthweight infants and those with fat malabsorption disorders. Reported symptoms of deficiency include haemolytic anaemia, reticulocytosis, hyperbilirubinaemia, low haemoglobin levels (<LINK REF="REF-Gross-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gross 1982</LINK>) and peripheral neuropathy (<LINK REF="REF-Roberts-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roberts 1990</LINK>). Vitamin E deficiency is exacerbated in the presence of iron overload and a high dietary intake of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), which is of particular relevance for preterm infants fed formula containing high levels of iron and PUFAs (<LINK REF="REF-Roberts-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roberts 1990</LINK>). Establishing a recommended dietary intake (RDI) of vitamin E has been impeded by the low observance of overt vitamin E deficiency; however, current RDI range from 7 mg to 10 mg alpha-TE (<LINK REF="REF-Roberts-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roberts 1990</LINK>). During pregnancy, losses of vitamin E to the fetus are thought to be minimal and thus the RDI during pregnancy is often unchanged (<LINK REF="REF-NHMRC-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">NHMRC 2006</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2015-04-09 01:57:36 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Vitamin E functions as an antioxidant in the lipid phase, protecting phospholipid fatty acids from oxidation by harmful free radicals (reactive oxygen molecules) and thus stabilising cell membranes. As an antioxidant, vitamin E helps to prevent oxidative stress, which is characterised by an excess of free radicals coupled with decreased antioxidants available to quench these free radicals. Vitamin E interacts synergistically with vitamin C, a water soluble antioxidant, where vitamin C helps to convert oxidised vitamin E back into a useful form (<LINK REF="REF-Packer-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Packer 1979</LINK>). This relationship may account for the limited observation of overt vitamin E deficiency in humans, as vitamin C may aid in recycling vitamin E stores. Vitamin E and vitamin C supplements are often given concurrently to utilise this relationship and to promote antioxidant defences in both the aqueous and lipid phase. Little is known about other potential functions of vitamin E as research to date has focused on its antioxidant properties. Doses of vitamin E required to have an antioxidant effect have been reported at least to 400 international units (approximately 268 mg alpha-TE) (<LINK REF="REF-Devaraj-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Devaraj 1997</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2015-08-24 10:48:53 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Sonja L Henderson">
<P>Oxidative stress has been linked to the development of adult diseases including cardiovascular disease, cancer, chronic inflammation and neurologic disorders, resulting in many large multicentre clinical trials of vitamin E supplementation. However, the results of these large trials of vitamin E supplementation have been disappointing and in fact provide evidence of harm, including an increased risk of mortality (<LINK REF="REF-Bjelakovic-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bjelakovic 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bjelakovic-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bjelakovic 2013</LINK>). During pregnancy, oxidative stress has been implicated in the development of pre-eclampsia (<LINK REF="REF-Roberts-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roberts 1990</LINK>), and proposed in the disease processes of intrauterine growth restriction (<LINK REF="REF-Kingdom-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kingdom 2000</LINK>) and prelabour rupture of membranes(PROM) both preterm and at term (<LINK REF="REF-Woods-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Woods 2001</LINK>). Oxidative stress has also been implicated in many of the disorders common to preterm infants including chronic lung disease, intraventricular hemorrhage, periventricular leukomalacia, retinopathy of prematurity, necrotising enterocolitis and bronchopulmonary dysplasia (<LINK REF="REF-Saugstad-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Saugstad 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Saugstad-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Saugstad 2001</LINK>). Preventing complications in pregnancy like pre-eclampsia, growth restriction, preterm PROM and serious neonatal morbidities would represent significant cost savings in hospital and intensive care unit admissions and the use of other healthcare resources. Other Cochrane reviews are assessing '<I>Antioxidants for preventing pre-eclampsia</I>' (<LINK REF="REF-Rumbold-2005a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rumbold 2005a</LINK>) and '<I>Vitamin C supplementation in pregnancy</I>' (<LINK REF="REF-Rumbold-2005b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rumbold 2005b</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2015-08-13 16:37:41 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>Vitamin E appears to have low toxicity in humans. However there is limited evidence on the safety of using vitamin E in pregnancy. Despite the lack of evidence on safety, the United States Institute of Medicine Food and Nutrition Board has set an upper tolerable limit of vitamin E ingestion in pregnancy at 1000 mg per day (<LINK REF="REF-IOM-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">IOM 2000</LINK>), indicating the highest level of intake that is likely to pose no risk of adverse health effects to almost all women. In non-pregnant adults controlled clinical trials of vitamin E supplementation in a variety of doses have failed to demonstrate any consistent side effects (<LINK REF="REF-Bendich-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bendich 1993</LINK>). Observational studies, however, have reported adverse effects including fatigue, weakness, creatinuria, dermatitis, reduced thyroid function, increased urinary androgen excretion, reduced leukocyte action and altered coagulation factors resulting in increased bleeding in vitamin K deficient individuals (<LINK REF="REF-Bendich-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bendich 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Roberts-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roberts 1990</LINK>). The mechanisms leading to altered coagulation factors are unclear; however, vitamin E has been reported to potentiate the effect of anticoagulant therapy, such as warfarin. Newborn infants have a relative vitamin K deficiency at birth, hence vitamin E supplementation during pregnancy may influence the risk of vitamin K deficiency bleeding or haemorrhagic disease of the newborn unfavourably if vitamin K is not given at birth. In controlled trials of vitamin E supplementation in preterm infants for the treatment of retinopathy of prematurity, vitamin E supplementation has been associated with an increased risk of bacterial sepsis and necrotising enterocolitis (<LINK REF="REF-Johnson-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnson 1985</LINK>). Given the lipid soluble nature of vitamin E, supplementation may result in increased storage of the vitamin in organs such as the liver, muscle and adipose tissue when used in high doses. The need to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of using vitamin E in pregnancy is particularly important when vitamin E is given in high doses.</P>
<P>The aims of this review are (i) to identify all published, unpublished randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials investigating vitamin E supplementation in pregnancy and (ii) to investigate the benefits and hazards of vitamin E supplementation in pregnancy.</P>

<P>Two review authors independently assessed risk of bias for each study using the criteria outlined in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). Any disagreement was resolved by discussion or by involving a third assessor.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(1) Random sequence generation (checking for possible selection bias)</HEADING>
<P>We described for each included study the method used to generate the allocation sequence in sufficient detail to allow an assessment of whether it should produce comparable groups.</P>
<P>We assessed the method as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>low risk of bias (any truly random process, e.g. random number table; computer random number generator);</LI>
<LI>high risk of bias (any non-random process, e.g. odd or even date of birth; hospital or clinic record number);</LI>
<LI>unclear risk of bias.</LI>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">(2) Allocation concealment (checking for possible selection bias)</HEADING>
<P>We described for each included study the method used to conceal allocation to interventions prior to assignment and assessed whether intervention allocation could have been foreseen in advance of, or during recruitment, or changed after assignment.</P>
<P>We assessed the methods as:</P>
<UL>

<P>We described for each included study the methods used, if any, to blind study participants and personnel from knowledge of which intervention a participant received. We considered that studies were at low risk of bias if they were blinded, or if we judged that the lack of blinding unlikely to affect results. We assessed blinding separately for different outcomes or classes of outcomes.</P>

<P>We described for each included study, and for each outcome or class of outcomes, the completeness of data including attrition and exclusions from the analysis. We stated whether attrition and exclusions were reported and the numbers included in the analysis at each stage (compared with the total randomised participants), reasons for attrition or exclusion where reported, and whether missing data were balanced across groups or were related to outcomes. Where sufficient information was reported, or could be supplied by the trial authors, we planned to re-include missing data in the analyses which we undertook.</P>
<P>We assessed methods as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>low risk of bias (e.g. no missing outcome data; missing outcome data balanced across groups);</LI>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">(5) Selective reporting (checking for reporting bias)</HEADING>
<P>We described for each included study how we investigated the possibility of selective outcome reporting bias and what we found.</P>
<P>We assessed the methods as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>low risk of bias (where it is clear that all of the study&#8217;s pre-specified outcomes and all expected outcomes of interest to the review have been reported);</LI>
<LI>high risk of bias (where not all the study&#8217;s pre-specified outcomes have been reported; one or more reported primary outcomes were not pre-specified; outcomes of interest are reported incompletely and so cannot be used; study fails to include results of a key outcome that would have been expected to have been reported);</LI>

<P>We made explicit judgements about whether studies were at high risk of bias, according to the criteria given in the <I>Handbook</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). With reference to (1) to (6) above, we planned to assess the likely magnitude and direction of the bias and whether we considered it is likely to impact on the findings.

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Assessment of quality of the evidence</HEADING>
<P>For this update, we assessed the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach (<LINK REF="REF-Schunemann-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schunemann 2009</LINK>) in order to assess the quality of the body of evidence relating to the following outcomes for the main comparisons:</P>
<OL>
<LI>stillbirth;</LI>
<LI>preterm birth (defined as less than 37 weeks' gestation);</LI>
<LI>development of clinical pre-eclampsia;</LI>
<LI>intrauterine growth restriction (defined as birthweight less than third centile or the most extreme centile reported);</LI>
<LI>preterm prelabour rupture of membranes (PROM) ;</LI>
<LI>bleeding episodes (placental abruption).</LI>
</OL>
<P>We used the GRADE profiler (<LINK REF="REF-GRADE-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">GRADE 2014</LINK>) to import data from Review Manager 5.3 (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2014</LINK>) in order to create a 'Summary of findings&#8217; table. A summary of the intervention effect and a measure of quality for each of the above outcomes was produced using the GRADE approach. The GRADE approach uses five considerations (study limitations, consistency of effect, imprecision, indirectness and publication bias) to assess the quality of the body of evidence for each outcome. The evidence can be downgraded from 'high quality' by one level for serious (or by two levels for very serious) limitations, depending on assessments for risk of bias, indirectness of evidence, serious inconsistency, imprecision of effect estimates or potential publication bias.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Cluster-randomised trials</HEADING>
<P>We did not identify any cluster-randomised trials in this update. In future updates, we will include cluster-randomised trials in the analyses along with individually-randomised trials,we will adjust their sample sizes using the methods described in the <I>Handbook</I> using an estimate of the intracluster correlation co-efficient (ICC) derived from the trial (if possible), from a similar trial or from a study of a similar population. If we use ICCs from other sources, we will report this and conduct sensitivity analyses to investigate the effect of variation in the ICC. If we identify both cluster-randomised trials and individually-randomised trials, we plan to synthesise the relevant information. We will consider it reasonable to combine the results from both if there is little heterogeneity between the study designs and the interaction between the effect of intervention and the choice of randomisation unit is considered to be unlikely.</P>

<P>For included studies, we noted levels of attrition. In future updates, if more eligible studies are included, we will explore the impact of including studies with high levels of missing data in the overall assessment of treatment effect by using sensitivity analysis.</P>
<P>For all outcomes, we carried out analyses, as far as possible, on an intention-to-treat basis i.e. we attempted to include all participants randomised to each group in the analyses. The denominator for each outcome in each trial was the number randomised minus any participants whose outcomes were known to be missing.</P>

<P>We assessed statistical heterogeneity in each meta-analysis using the Tau, I and Chi statistics. We regarded heterogeneity as substantial if an I was greater than 30% and either a Tau was greater than zero, or there was a low P value (less than 0.10) in the Chi test for heterogeneity.

<DATA_SYNTHESIS MODIFIED="2015-08-13 17:09:58 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>We carried out statistical analysis using the Review Manager software (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2014</LINK>). We used fixed-effect meta-analysis for combining data where it was reasonable to assume that studies were estimating the same underlying treatment effect: i.e. where trials were examining the same intervention, and the trials&#8217; populations and methods were judged sufficiently similar.</P>
<P>If there was clinical heterogeneity sufficient to expect that the underlying treatment effects differed between trials, or if substantial statistical heterogeneity was detected, we used random-effects meta-analysis to produce an overall summary, if an average treatment effect across trials was considered clinically meaningful. The random-effects summary was treated as the average range of possible treatment effects and we discussed the clinical implications of treatment effects differing between trials. If the average treatment effect was not clinically meaningful, we did not combine trials. Where we used random-effects analyses, the results were presented as the average treatment effect with 95% confidence intervals, and the estimates of Tau and I.</P>

<SUBGROUP_ANALYSIS MODIFIED="2015-08-13 17:10:08 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>If we identified substantial heterogeneity, we investigated it using subgroup analyses and sensitivity analyses. We considered whether an overall summary was meaningful, and if it was, we used random-effects analysis to produce it.</P>

<OL>
<LI>the dosage of the vitamin E supplement (above or equal to versus below the recommended dietary intake of 7 mg alpha-TE);</LI>

<P>None of the studies reported on adverse events that were sufficient to stop supplementation. Possible side effects of supplementation were poorly reported (<LINK REF="CMP-001.33" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.33</LINK>).

An additional study (<LINK REF="STD-Poston-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Poston 2006</LINK>), reported that there was no clear difference in liver enzymes between treatment groups, however the data could not be included in the meta-analysis. One trial reported an increased risk of abdominal pain in women supplemented with vitamin E in combination with other supplements (RR 1.66, 95% CI 1.16 to 2.37, 1877 participants).

<P>Furthemore, one study (<LINK REF="STD-McCance-2010" TYPE="STUDY">McCance 2010</LINK>), stated in the text that there were "no adverse events or side effects attributable to supplementation."</P>
<P>Substantial heterogeneity for found for outcomes related to use of health service resources for the mother (<LINK REF="CMP-001.34" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.34</LINK>).There was no clear difference between women supplemented with vitamin E in combination with other supplements compared with placebo in the risk of admission to the adult intensive care unit (average RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.16 to 2.30; two trials, 3718, participants; I = 45%), or hospitalisations in pregnancy (average RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.30 to 1.80, two trials, 2407 participants; I = 61%), when using a random-effects model.

When the analyses were restricted to studies at low overall risk of bias, the risks of stillbirth, neonatal death, perinatal death, preterm birth, pre-eclampsia and intrauterine growth restriction did not change substantively to the analyses which included all trials (<LINK REF="CMP-002.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.1</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-002.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.2</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-002.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.3</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-002.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.4</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-002.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.5</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-002.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.6</LINK>). However, for the outcomes preterm birth and clinical pre-eclampsia (<LINK REF="CMP-002.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.4</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-002.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.5</LINK>), restricting the analyses to studies at low risk of bias reduced the heterogeneity, from 52% to 32% and 48% to 25%, respectively, and there was a small reduction in the effect sizes (although both remained not statistically significant), suggesting that variation in trial quality explains some of the heterogeneity detected for these outcomes.</P>

<P>All of the included studies supplemented women with vitamin E in a dosage above the recommended dietary intake (RDI). Therefore, subgroup analyses based on dosage were not performed. Furthermore, there was limited variation in the dosages used above the RDI. For example, 15 trials used the same dose of daily 400 international units (IU) vitamin E, a further three trials gave women either daily 100 mg, 200 IU or 800 IU vitamin E, and the dose was unknown for a further three trials.</P>

For a further four trials (<LINK REF="STD-Anthony-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Anthony 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mahdy-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Mahdy 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nasrolahi-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Nasrolahi 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sawhney-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Sawhney 2000</LINK>), the gestation at trial entry was unknown.</P>
<P>When the analyses were stratified across these groups, the test for subgroup differences was not significant for stillbirth, preterm birth, neonatal death, perinatal death, preterm birth and intrauterine growth restriction (<LINK REF="CMP-003.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.1</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-003.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.2</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-003.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.3</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-003.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.4</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-003.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.5</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-003.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.6</LINK>), and the findings in the subgroups were not substantively different to the main analyses. Subgroup differences were apparent for the outcome pre-eclampsia (Chi = 7.11, P = 0.03, I = 71.9%), indeed the risk of pre-eclampsia was reduced in the two trials that reported pre-eclampsia and where gestation at trial entry was unknown (RR 0.32, 95% CI 0.13 to 0.79, two trials, 693 participants, I = 0%). However, there was no significant difference in risk of pre-eclampsia in the trials that enrolled women prior to 20 weeks' (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.16,five trials, 13,299 participants; I = 0%), or those that enrolled both women before and after 20 weeks' (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.12, seven trials, 6886 participants; I = 57%). As the only significant difference was detected in trials with an unknown gestation at trial entry, the subgroup findings for pre-eclampsia are likely to reflect characteristics related to the quality of the trial, not the timing of commencement of supplementation. Collectively, these findings suggest that the treatment effect does not vary substantively by the gestation at trial entry and that differences in this characteristic do not contribute significantly to the observed heterogeneity.</P>

<P>Three trials supplemented women with vitamin E alone (<LINK REF="STD-Anthony-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Anthony 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sawhney-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Sawhney 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shahraki-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Shahraki 2006</LINK>), however none of these trials reported any clinically meaningful information. Seventeen trials gave women vitamin E in combination with vitamin C, and two of these trials also supplemented women additionally with either allopurinol (<LINK REF="STD-Gulmezoglu-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Gulmezoglu 1997</LINK>), or aspirin and fish oil (<LINK REF="STD-Rivas-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Rivas 2000</LINK>). The remaining trial supplemented women with a vitamin E rich fraction of palm oil, which is likely to have contained other nutritional agents, however, no further information was provided about the content of the supplement. Therefore, as there were no trials available to assess the effect of vitamin E supplementation alone, subgroup analyses were not performed.</P>

For this subgroup analysis, all 14 of these studies were classified as including women at 'high/increased risk' of adverse pregnancy outcomes. Five trials supplemented nulliparous or primiparous women (<LINK REF="STD-Huria-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Huria 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mahdy-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Mahdy 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nasrolahi-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Nasrolahi 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Roberts-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Roberts 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rumbold-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Rumbold 2006</LINK>), one trial supplemented pregnant women with leg cramps (<LINK REF="STD-Shahraki-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Shahraki 2006</LINK>), and a further trial supplemented with planned caesarean section (<LINK REF="STD-Pressman-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Pressman 2003</LINK>). These remaining seven trials were classified as including women at 'low/moderate risk' of adverse pregnancy outcomes.</P>
<P>For the outcomes stillbirth, neonatal death, perinatal death, preterm birth, clinical pre-eclampsia and intrauterine growth restriction, there were no clear differences in the effects of vitamin E supplementation in combination with other supplements versus placebo or no control for women classified as 'high/increased risk' and for those classified as 'low/moderate' risk (<LINK REF="CMP-005.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 5.1</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-005.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 5.2</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-005.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 5.3</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-005.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 5.4</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-005.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 5.5</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-005.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 5.6</LINK>). Furthermore, the tests for subgroup differences were not significant for any of these outcomes. For the outcomes pre-eclampsia and preterm birth, substantial heterogeneity was present in the analyses of both of these subgroups, suggesting that heterogeneity between included studies may be due to other factors rather than just differences in baseline risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-08-24 10:40:55 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Sonja L Henderson">
<P>The results of this review, which included 21 trials involving over 21,000 women and their babies, do not support routine vitamin E supplementation in combination with other supplements in pregnancy. We found no clear differences between women supplemented with vitamin E compared with placebo or control for the risk of any primary maternal or infant outcomes including fetal, perinatal or neonatal death, preterm birth, pre-eclampsia or intrauterine growth restriction. Supplementation was associated with a reduced risk of placental abruption, which warrants further investigation. However, there was also some evidence of harm, as supplementation appeared to increase the risk of term prelabour rupture of membranes (PROM) as well as self-reported abdominal pain. There was no convincing evidence that vitamin E supplementation in combination with other supplements results in any other important benefits or harms.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2015-08-24 10:33:25 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Sonja L Henderson">
<P>In this review, three trials assessed vitamin E supplementation alone in pregnancy; however, the data from these trials could not be used in the meta-analysis. Seventeen trials assessed vitamin E in conjunction with vitamin C, and one further trial gave with a vitamin E rich fraction of palm oil. Therefore, there was no information available to assess whether vitamin E supplementation alone may be beneficial or harmful for women, hence any treatment effects seen here may not be directly attributable to vitamin E.</P>
<P>This review provides reliable information about the impact of vitamin E supplementation in combination with other supplements on a range of maternal, perinatal and infant health outcomes. Pre-eclampsia was the most commonly reported outcome among included studies (14 trials, 20,878 participants). This is not surprising as 14 trials assessed vitamin E supplementation in combination with other supplements for the prevention of pre-eclampsia. Other commonly reported outcomes were preterm birth (11 trials, 20,565 participants), intrauterine growth restriction (11 trials, 20,202 participants), birthweight (10 trials, 16,888 participants), fetal and neonatal death (nine trials, 19,023 participants), eclampsia (eight trials, 19,471 participants), neonatal respiratory distress syndrome (eight trials, 18,574 women) and admission to the neonatal intensive care unit (eight trials, 17,782 participants).</P>
<P>However, no trials reported any maternal and infant haematological measures (except hyperbilirubinaemia reported by one trial), vitamin K deficiency bleeding, peripheral neuropathy, maternal satisfaction with care or any possible long-term benefits or harms of supplementation for the mother. One trial (<LINK REF="STD-Poston-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Poston 2006</LINK>) reported on various measures of respiratory function (wheezing, asthma) in children aged up to two years, however, whether antenatal supplementation influences the health of children beyond two years of age is unknown .There were also scarce available data on side effects of vitamin E supplementation. One trial reported an increased risk of low abdominal pain in the vitamin supplemented group compared with a placebo control. There were no other clear differences between women supplemented with vitamin E compared with placebo or no control for any other potential side effects assessed, including elevated liver enzymes, acne, transient weakness and skin rash.</P>
<P>We detected substantial heterogeneity for the outcomes perinatal death, preterm birth, pre-eclampsia, birthweight, and preterm PROM. For perinatal death, excluding the trial by <LINK REF="STD-Villar-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Villar 2009</LINK> reduced the heterogeneity to zero. Therefore, the observed heterogeneity may reflect different characteristics of participating women or differential access to maternity care, as the <LINK REF="STD-Villar-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Villar 2009</LINK> trial involved women of low income in developing countries at risk of poor nutritional status, who may have a generally higher risk of perinatal mortality than women in the other trials who were predominantly from Western, developed, countries.</P>
<P>For preterm birth and pre-eclampsia, the identified heterogeneity appears to be explained in part by variation in the quality of included studies. For example, in the sensitivity analyses, when studies at high or unclear risk of bias were excluded the magnitude of the heterogeneity was reduced markedly. Furthermore, for preterm birth, removing the trial by <LINK REF="STD-McCance-2010" TYPE="STUDY">McCance 2010</LINK> further reduced the heterogeneity (down to I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 5%). The heterogeneity that appears to be associated with <LINK REF="STD-McCance-2010" TYPE="STUDY">McCance 2010</LINK> may reflect a higher baseline risk of preterm birth among participants in this trial compared with other trials, as <LINK REF="STD-McCance-2010" TYPE="STUDY">McCance 2010</LINK> included women with type 1 diabetes, a known risk factor for preterm birth (<LINK REF="REF-Hanson-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hanson 1993</LINK>). Indeed the rate of preterm birth in the control group of this trial was 41%, the rate in the control group of other included studies ranged from 4% to 45% (median 23%).</P>
<P>In the sensitivity analyses for pre-eclampsia, removing the trial by <LINK REF="STD-Chappell-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Chappell 1999</LINK> reduced the heterogeneity to zero. It is possible that heterogeneity associated with <LINK REF="STD-Chappell-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Chappell 1999</LINK> may reflect differences in underlying risk, however the rate of pre-eclampsia in the control group (17%) was similar to that observed in other included trials (range 3% to 25%, median 15%). As <LINK REF="STD-Chappell-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Chappell 1999</LINK> was a small, positive trial, we explored the possibility of reporting bias for this outcome using a funnel plot (see <LINK REF="FIG-04" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 4</LINK>). The distribution of the results in <LINK REF="FIG-04" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 4</LINK> are skewed, indicating that small studies reporting negative findings may be missing which could indicate reporting bias.</P>
<P>For preterm PROM, removing the trials by <LINK REF="STD-Spinnato-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Spinnato 2007</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Xu-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Xu 2010</LINK> reduced the heterogeneity to zero and the point estimate changed from RR = 1.27 to 1.02. The cause of the heterogeneity associated with these two studies is unclear. Both were judged to be at low overall risk of bias, and participants did not appear to be at high risk of preterm PROM, as the rate in the control group of both trials was lower than the rate observed in other included trials (7% to 18% versus 20% to 37%). One possibility is that there was a greater proportion of women with a history of PROM (either preterm or term) in the vitamin E group; however, this cannot be examined as information about the history of PROM among multiparous participants is not available. As these two trials are the only studies that contribute data for the outcome term PROM, the finding of an increased risk of term PROM among vitamin E supplemented women should be interpreted with caution. It should be noted that another included trial (<LINK REF="STD-Poston-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Poston 2006</LINK>), reported that there was no difference in the risk of either preterm or term PROM between treatment groups, however, individual data were not reported so this trial did not contribute to the meta-analysis for those outcomes. Further observational research investigating the role of vitamin E in the development of preterm and term PROM is warranted.</P>
<P>We also undertook pre-specified subgroup analyses exploring the effect of variation in baseline risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes. Approximately two-thirds of all trials included women considered to be at high or increased risk of adverse outcomes (mostly pre-eclampsia). For all of the primary outcomes, the effect sizes did not vary substantially between women at high/increased risk and women at low/moderate risk, suggesting that there are no benefits of supplementation in particular subgroups based on underlying risk.</P>
<P>We also undertook other subgroup analyses to explore the impact of variation in timing of commencement of supplementation (i.e. gestation at trial entry) and adequacy of dietary intake of vitamin E prior to trial entry. While there was substantial variation in the gestation at trial entry across all of the included studies, the subgroup analyses did not reveal any substantial differences in the effect size between trials enrolling women prior to 20 weeks&#8217;, after 20 weeks&#8217; or that included women both prior to and after 20 weeks&#8217; gestation. This suggests that there is no benefit of commencing supplementation either earlier or later in pregnancy.</P>
<P>Whether vitamin E supplementation is beneficial for women with low or inadequate vitamin E intake is unclear. Only two studies reported information specifically about women's dietary intake of vitamin E at trial entry, and in the subgroup analyses including these trials, there were no apparent benefits of vitamin E supplementation either in women with low or adequate intake. One study (<LINK REF="STD-Villar-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Villar 2009</LINK>) was undertaken in women from populations with a presumed low dietary intake of vitamin E, based on dietary information collected in previous studies of clinic attendees. There was no clear difference in the pattern of risks of adverse outcomes in these women either. One trial (<LINK REF="STD-McCance-2010" TYPE="STUDY">McCance 2010</LINK>), reported information about pre-eclampsia according to baseline plasma vitamin E status. In this trial, there appeared to be a reduced risk of pre-eclampsia in women with a low baseline vitamin E intake, although the result was of borderline statistical significance and should be interpreted with caution due to the small number of women in this subgroup (n = 95).</P>
<P>Subgroup analyses exploring the impact of vitamin E dosage and use of vitamin E combined with other supplements were planned but could not be undertaken due to insufficient data in each subgroup.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2015-08-24 10:33:25 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Sonja L Henderson">
<P>The overall risk of bias is low to unclear for most of the studies, however, there were some high quality, large trials that were heavily weighted in the analysis. Five trials were judged to be at high risk of bias.</P>
<P>The quality of the evidence using GRADE was high for preterm birth, intrauterine growth restriction and placental abruption, moderate for stillbirth and clinical pre-eclampsia, and low for preterm PROM (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>). The outcomes were downgraded due to wide confidence interval crossing the line of no effect, statistical heterogeneity, and publication bias.</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2015-07-07 11:05:51 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We followed the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group search strategies, which includes a search of the Trials Register that is updated weekly to monthly from a range of databases as well as handsearches from selected journals and proceedings of major conferences. Therefore, it is unlikely that studies that have been missed, although it is possible that studies that have not been published could be missing. Should any further studies be identified, we will include them in future updates of the review. We also followed the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group recommended review process to reduce potential biases, which included having at least two review authors independently assessing identified studies, extracting data and evaluating risk of bias.</P>

<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2015-04-08 15:08:03 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The findings of this review are in agreement with several meta-analyses examining the effects of vitamin C and E supplementation for the prevention of pre-eclampsia and other maternal and perinatal complications (<LINK REF="REF-Basaran-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Basaran 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Conde_x002d_Agudelo-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Conde-Agudelo 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>The finding of a 36% reduction in the relative risk of placental abruption among vitamin E supplemented women compared with placebo or no control warrants further investigation. There is some limited evidence of serum markers of oxidative stress as well as low serum levels of vitamin E in women with placental abruption (<LINK REF="REF-Incebiyik-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Incebiyik 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sharma-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sharma 1986</LINK>), suggesting a biologically plausible role for vitamin E supplementation. However, lower serum levels of other antioxidants including vitamin C have also been demonstrated (<LINK REF="REF-Sharma-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sharma 1985</LINK>), therefore, it is unclear whether the result observed in this review is due to vitamin E or C or the combination of both agents. Further observational research examining the underlying pathways to placental abruption is required, before any firm conclusions can be drawn about this finding.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2015-08-24 10:33:25 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Sonja L Henderson">
<P>There is now a large body of evidence from randomised trials involving over 21,000 women assessing the effects of vitamin E supplementation in combination with other supplements including vitamin C in pregnancy. The available data do not support routine vitamin E supplementation in combination with other supplements for the prevention of fetal or neonatal death, preterm birth, pre-eclampsia, or intrauterine growth restriction for all women or for women at high risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes. Supplementation was associated with a reduced risk of placental abruption, this should be explored in further research examining the specific role of vitamin E in the etiology of placental abruption. There was some evidence of harm, as vitamin E supplementation appeared to increase the risk of term PROM and self-reported abdominal pain.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2015-08-11 15:39:50 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>The reduction in placental abruption requires further assessment. Future research should be conducted to examine whether the observed effects for placental abruption are due to vitamin E or the influence of other agents including vitamin C. Long-term follow-up studies of women and children enrolled in the current trials are required to determine whether there are any longer term benefits or harms of vitamin E supplementation. Further research is also required to examine the effect of supplementation in women with a low or inadequate intake of vitamin E prior to and in early pregnancy.</P>

The placebo gel caps contained excipients only and were externally identical to the active drug. Participants were instructed to ingest 2 gel caps daily from enrolment until delivery or until the diagnosis of pre-eclampsia. Compliance with treatment was assessed by counting residual pills at monthly return visits.

The active and placebo tablets for each vitamin were identical in form, colour and taste and were provided in boxes containing 4 blister packs, each marked Monday to Sunday. Custom Pharmaceuticals prepared vitamin C (1000 mg) and identical placebo tablets (microcrystalline cellulose) with addition of tartaric and citric acid to provide similar acidic taste and Banner Pharmacaps prepared identical gelatin capsules containing 400 IU natural source vitamin E (RRR-a-tocopherol) or a placebo (sunflower seed oil) and the tablets and capsules sealed in blister strips, each with a 1-week supply were packaged.

Of the 38 women in the control group, 16 were "lost to follow up" and 22 delivered elsewhere. The reasons for delivery elsewhere were not provided. Although the number of women lost to follow-up in each group was similar, given the magnitude of the effect size for some outcomes (e.g. preterm birth), the review authors suspect that there may be clinically relevant bias. For example, the risk of preterm birth was 14.7% in control and 4.7% in the vitamin group, which could reflect women in the vitamin group who are in preterm labour being transferred to another hospital for delivery.</P>
