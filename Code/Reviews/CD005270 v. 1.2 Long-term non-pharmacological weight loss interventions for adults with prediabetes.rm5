<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Persons with blood glucose levels that are abnormal, but not in the range of persons with diabetes, are said to have prediabetes, which often precedes the development of type 2 diabetes. Most persons with prediabetes are overweight and obesity worsens the blood glucose and other problems associated with prediabetes. In this review we found that dietary, physical activity, or behavioral interventions produced significant improvements in weight among persons with prediabetes and a significant decrease in diabetes incidence. Modest, but not statistically significant improvements were noted in the few studies that examined blood sugar control, blood pressure, and lipid levels. No data on quality of life or mortality were found.</P>
</SUMMARY_BODY>
</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Most persons with prediabetes (impaired glucose tolerance or impaired fasting glucose) are overweight, and obesity worsens the metabolic and physiologic abnormalities associated with this condition. Prediabetes is an important risk factor for the development of type 2 diabetes.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>The objective of this review was to assess the effectiveness of dietary, physical activity, and behavioral weight loss, and weight control interventions for adults with prediabetes.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>Studies were obtained from computerized searches of multiple electronic bibliographic dababases, supplemented by hand searches of selected journals, and consultation with experts in obesity research. The last search was conducted May, 2004.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Studies were included if they were published or unpublished randomized controlled trials in any language and examined weight loss or weight control strategies using one or more dietary, physical activity, or behavioral interventions, with a follow-up interval of at least 12 months.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Effects were combined using a random-effects model.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Nine studies were identified, with a total of 5,168 participants. Follow-up ranged from 1 to 10 years. Quantitative synthesis was limited by the heterogeneity of populations, settings, and interventions and by the small number of studies that examined outcomes other than weight. Overall, in comparisons with usual care, four studies with a follow-up of one year reduced weight by 2.8 kg (95 % confidence interval (CI) 1.0 to 4.7) (3.3% of baseline body weight) and decreased body mass index by 1.3 kg/m<SUP>2</SUP> (95% CI 0.8 to 1.9). Weight loss at two years was 2.6 kg (95% CI 1.9 to 3.3) (three studies). Modest improvements were noted in the few studies that examined glycemic control, blood pressure, or lipid concentrations (P &gt; 0.05). No data on quality of life or mortality were found. The incidence of diabetes was significantly lower in the intervention groups versus the controls in three of five studies examining this outcome at 3 to 6 years follow-up.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>Overall, weight loss strategies using dietary, physical activity, or behavioral interventions produced significant improvements in weight among persons with prediabetes and a significant decrease in diabetes incidence. Further work is needed on the long-term effects of these interventions on morbidity and mortality and on how to implement these interventions in diverse community settings.</P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>

<BODY MODIFIED="2008-10-27 13:06:31 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gudrun Paletta">
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and impaired fasting glucose (IFG), now referred to collectively as prediabetes, dramatically increase the risk for progression to clinical diabetes (<LINK REF="REF-Edelstein-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Edelstein 1997</LINK>), incident cardiovascular disease, and cardiovascular mortality <LINK REF="REF-DECODE-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">DECODE 2001</LINK>. IFG and IGT refer to metabolic stages between normal glucose levels and diabetes. Persons with IGT have blood glucose levels greater than 7.8 mmol/L and less than 11.1 mmol/L two hours after a 75 g glucose load. IFG refers to individuals with a fasting plasma glucose greater than 5.6 mmol/L but less than 7.0 mmol/L (<LINK REF="REF-ADA-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">ADA 2004</LINK>). Data from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination survey (1988-1994) projected to the year 2000 revealed that prediabetes is highly prevalent, affecting almost 12 million overweight persons aged 45-74 years in the United States <LINK REF="REF-Benjamin-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Benjamin 2003</LINK>.</P>
<P>Weight loss and control are key goals for persons with diabetes. Weight loss improves insulin sensitivity and glycemic control (<LINK REF="REF-ADA-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">ADA 2003</LINK>) lipid profiles, blood pressure (<LINK REF="REF-Maggio-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maggio 1997</LINK>), mental health, and quality of life (<LINK REF="REF-Wing-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wing 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wing-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wing 1991</LINK>). Moderate intentional weight loss sustained over time may be associated with reduced mortality (<LINK REF="REF-Williamson-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Williamson 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wing-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wing 1985</LINK>). Similarly, several large randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have shown that weight loss is also a potentially important management strategy for overweight persons with prediabetes, as it may delay or prevent progression to clinically defined type 2 diabetes (<LINK REF="STD-DPP-2002" TYPE="STUDY">DPP 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tuomilehto-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Tuomilehto 2001</LINK>). The American Diabetes Association recently recommended that "individuals at high risk for developing diabetes need to become aware of the benefits of modest weight loss and participating in regular physical activity" (<LINK REF="REF-ADA-2004a" TYPE="REFERENCE">ADA 2004a</LINK>). </P>
<P>Dietary and behavioral treatment for weight loss can produce an average loss of 8% of initial body weight over 3 to 12 months (<LINK REF="REF-NHLBI-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">NHLBI 1998</LINK>). It is difficult to define effective weight control measures for the long term in general populations, however (<LINK REF="REF-NHLBI-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">NHLBI 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Meara-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Meara 1998</LINK>). The majority of obese patients regain most of the weight initially they lost in successful interventions (<LINK REF="REF-Maggio-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maggio 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wadden-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wadden 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wing-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wing 1985</LINK>). Similarly, Skender and colleagues note that most of the weight lost in the early phase (16 to 20 weeks) is regained within two to five years <LINK REF="REF-Skender-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Skender 1996</LINK>. </P>
<P>To assess the effectiveness of dietary, physical activity, and behavioral interventions for weight loss or weight control in adults with prediabetes on the outcomes of weight, other cardiovascular risk factors, and the incidence of diabetes, we conducted a systematic review of RCTs of these interventions. The systematic review and synthesis of all available data allowed us to explore heterogeneity and applicability of interventions and outcomes, potentially achieve pooled estimates of effect with increased precision over single studies, increase the power to explore relationships between intervention characteristics and outcomes, and identify gaps in the existing literature.</P>

<CRIT_STUDIES>
<P>Only RCTs were included in this review, as we identified an adequate number of relevant studies of this design. We, therefore, decided not to include weaker study designs, as originally proposed. </P>
<P>Studies with a follow-up of 12 months or greater were included, as long-term weight loss is needed to produce effects on health outcomes such as cardiovascular disease events <LINK REF="REF-Wing-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wing 1985</LINK>. We defined the follow-up period from the time of randomization until the last measurement in the study. The intervention itself could be of any duration. </P>
<P>Weight or BMI at baseline and follow-up, or percent weight lost must have been presented in the study to be included.</P>
</CRIT_STUDIES>
<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS MODIFIED="2008-10-27 13:05:51 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gudrun Paletta">
<P>Participants must have been aged 18 years or greater and have prediabetes. Prediabetes could have been defined by an abnormal oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), IFG, or a combination of the two. Because criteria for defining IGT and IFG have changed in the last 20 years, we included studies in which participants met criteria for abnormalities at the time of the study, but who would now may be considered in a different category (for example fasting blood sugar 126 to 139 mg/dl is now considered diabetes (<LINK REF="REF-ADA-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">ADA 2004</LINK>), but at the time of many of the studies was considered IFG).</P>
<P>Study participants could be of any weight or BMI at baseline; they did not have to be overweight or obese. Weight loss or weight maintenance decreases cardiovascular risk in persons with a BMI less than 25.0 (the lower limit of overweight) (<LINK REF="REF-Kuller-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kuller 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ornish-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ornish 1998</LINK>).</P>
</CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS MODIFIED="2008-10-27 13:06:00 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gudrun Paletta">
<P>Interventions included in the review had to have weight loss or weight control as one of their primary stated goals; interventions where weight loss was a secondary or unexpected result were excluded. Interventions had to focus on the patient rather than the provider or health care system. Interventions which focused on changing provider behavior were excluded, even when outcomes were measured in the patient (for example, an intervention to educate providers about weight loss counselling, with patient weight change the primary outcome).</P>
<P>Interventions were classified as dietary, physical activity, or behavioral strategies. Dietary programs provided recommendations and/or material support for achieving a specific dietary regime. All types of dietary programs initiated for weight loss or control were examined in this review, including low-calorie diets (800 to 1,500 kcal/day) and very low calorie diets (less than 800 kcal/day) (<LINK REF="REF-NHLBI-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">NHLBI 1998</LINK>). Studies were excluded if the sole purpose of the intervention was nutrition education or to teach about diet (for example, carbohydrate and fat exchanges, food consumption and the relationship to glycemia) and not explicitly to achieve weight loss or weight control.</P>
<P>Physical activity programs were included if one of the primary goals was to achieve weight loss or weight control by increased physical activity. Physical activity interventions included a specific approach to increasing activity levels (including counselling), an exercise prescription, or participation in either a supervised or unsupervised exercise program. Programs in which participants were simply advised to increase their level of exercise, with no details of the intervention provided, were not considered physical activity programs for this review.</P>
<P>Behavioral strategies were based on behavioral and learning principles and addressed barriers to diet or physical activity <LINK REF="REF-NHLBI-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">NHLBI 1998</LINK>. These strategies included one or more of the following interventions: education, cognitive-behavioral therapy (for example stimulus control, reinforcement, goal setting), social support, and psychotherapy. Studies were included that examined the combined effect of two or more of the interventions discussed above.</P>
<P>
<I>Excluded interventions</I>:<BR/>We excluded pharmacologic therapy, surgery, acupuncture, and hypnosis for the purpose of weight loss, as these interventions have very different mechanisms of action and are best dealt with by a separate review. We also excluded herbal remedies and dietary supplements. Studies examining unintentional weight loss were also excluded, as were studies involving binge eating and other eating disorders.</P>
<P>
<I>Types of comparison interventions</I>
<BR/>We included studies with a range of comparison groups to determine which interventions were more effective than others.</P>
<P>The comparison group could have received:<BR/>a. No intervention;<BR/>b. Usual care;<BR/>c. The same intervention at a different intensity (frequency, duration, time frame for delivery);<BR/>d. Any other weight loss or weight control intervention: behavioral strategy, dietary program, physical activity program, drug therapy, surgery.</P>

<P>Using Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) and text words, we searched the following databases between the date indicated and May 2004: MEDLINE (1966), EMBASE (1980), CINAHL (1982), ERIC (1980), PsychINFO (1967), Web of Science (1981), Biosis (1969), and Nutrition Abstracts and Review (1980). We also searched the <I>The Cochrane Library</I> (2004, Issue 2) and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (2004, Issue 2). We manually searched journals expected to have the highest relevance, from 1980: Diabetes Care, International Journal of Obesity and Related Metabolic Disorders, Obesity Research (commenced in 1993), American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, and Journal of the American Dietetic Association. Reference lists of all included studies and relevant reviews were examined and experts in obesity were consulted for additional citations. The 1998 review of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (<LINK REF="REF-NHLBI-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">NHLBI 1998</LINK>) and the 1997 review of the University of York, National Health Centre for Reviews and Dissemination (<LINK REF="REF-UYCRD-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">UYCRD 1997</LINK>) were examined for relevant citations.</P>
<P>There were no language restrictions on our searches. Conference proceedings and abstracts were included in a sensitivity analysis but not in the primary review, because they had insufficient detail to evaluate the intervention and the quality of the study. Dissertations were excluded, as they are difficult to locate in full text.</P>

<DATA_EXTRACTION MODIFIED="2008-10-27 12:33:38 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gudrun Paletta">
<P>For studies that fulfilled inclusion criteria, two reviewers independently abstracted relevant population and intervention characteristics using a standardised template, and consensus was achieved through discussion. Outcomes examined included weight loss, percent weight loss (based on individual data), BMI, fasting blood glucose, GHb, blood pressure, and lipid concentrations. Abstraction of data was not blinded, as there is no evidence that blinding of this process decreases bias in the conduct of systematic reviews and meta-analyses (<LINK REF="REF-Berlin-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Berlin 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Irwig-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Irwig 1994</LINK>). We attempted to contact the authors for missing data or when we needed clarification of the data presented.</P>
<P>For continuous outcomes we abstracted for each study group the baseline sample size, pre and post intervention mean and measure of dispersion (SD [standard deviation], standard error of the mean (SEM), or 95% confidence interval [CI]) for the intervention and comparison groups. When necessary, mean and SD were approximated from figures using an image scanner to optimize resolution.

<P>Funnel plots were used in exploratory data analysis to assess for the potential existence of small sample bias. There are a number of explanations for the asymmetry of a funnel plot, including true heterogeneity of effect with respect to study size, poor methodological design of small studies (<LINK REF="REF-Sterne-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sterne 2001</LINK>), and publication bias. Thus, this exploratory data tool may be misleading (<LINK REF="REF-Tang-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tang 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Thornton-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thornton 2000</LINK>) and we did not place undue emphasis on this tool (<LINK REF="REF-Thornton-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thornton 2000</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Statistical pooling</HEADING>
<P>When data were available which were sufficiently similar with respect to interventions and outcomes, pooled estimates of effect were obtained using Review Manager software. For continuous variables reported on the same scale, the absolute differences in outcome between each follow-up and the baseline measure were reported for each study group (delta I and delta C). The estimate of variance of (delta I) and (delta C) was calculated from the outcome measures in each study group using the formula Vpre+ Vpost - 2r(SDpre*SDpost), where Vpre is the variance of the mean baseline outcome, Vpost is the variance of the mean follow-up outcome, r is the correlation between the baseline and follow-up values, and SDpre and SDpost are the standard deviations of the baseline and follow-up groups, respectively. The variance of (delta) was then calculated as the sum of the variance of (delta I) and the variance of (delta C). Because studies do not report r, and its true value is unknown, a sensitivity analysis was performed using values of 0.25, 0.5, 0.75 and 1.0. tabular data and the figure are presented using r = 0.75, unless otherwise noted.</P>
<P>Data were pooled using the random-effects model, using the DerSimonian and Laird formula to calculate between-study variance (<LINK REF="REF-DerSimonian-1954" TYPE="REFERENCE">DerSimonian 1954</LINK>). Each study was weighted by the inverse of the study variance. Heterogeneity was examined using a standard chi-squared test and a significance level of alpha equals 0.1, in view of the low power of such tests. Heterogeneity was also examined with I<SUP>2 </SUP>, where I<SUP>2</SUP> values of 75% and more indicate a high level of heterogeneity (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2003</LINK>). When heterogeneity was found, we attempted to determine potential reasons for it by examining individual study characteristics and those of subgroups of the main body of evidence.</P>
<P>We analyzed the effects of treatment in individual study arms so as to examine within-group changes for both intervention and comparison groups.

<P>Nine eligible RCTs were identified in the published literature (<LINK REF="STD-DPP-2002" TYPE="STUDY">DPP 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dyson-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Dyson 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jarrett-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Jarrett 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Liao-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Liao 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lindahl-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Lindahl 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mensink-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Mensink 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Page-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Page 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pan-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Pan 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tuomilehto-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Tuomilehto 2001</LINK>). These were all weight loss studies among overweight or obese persons with prediabetes; no study focused exclusively on weight control. No unpublished studies were identified. The study flow diagram is available from the authors. In all, the studies included 5,168 participants (range, 31 to 3,234) and the follow-up interval averaged 3.2 years. The study populations varied somewhat in terms of how abnormal glycemia was defined, with several studies using IGT (variably defined) (<LINK REF="STD-Jarrett-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Jarrett 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lindahl-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Lindahl 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Page-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Page 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pan-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Pan 1997</LINK>). One study (<LINK REF="STD-Dyson-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Dyson 1997</LINK>) specified only fasting glucose, overlapping both normal, IFG, and the current ADA definition of diabetes (<LINK REF="REF-ADA-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">ADA 2004</LINK>) and two other studies (<LINK REF="STD-Mensink-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Mensink 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tuomilehto-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Tuomilehto 2001</LINK>) also overlapped with the current criteria for diabetes (<LINK REF="REF-ADA-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">ADA 2004</LINK>). It was not possible to exclude patients with normoglycemia by current standards from analyses as these populations were not presented as subgroups in the original papers. Some studies combined restrictions on fasting glucose with IGT (<LINK REF="STD-DPP-2002" TYPE="STUDY">DPP 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Liao-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Liao 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mensink-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Mensink 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tuomilehto-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Tuomilehto 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>Mean age, weight, and BMI at baseline, as well as ethnicity and sex all varied considerably among the studies. Overall, the mean age was 51.2 years, and studies contained 50% women, on average. Mean baseline weight was 82.2 kg (range, 69.7 to 94.2), BMI 28.7 (range, 25.8 to 34.0), and GHb 5.8% (range, 5.7 to 5.9%).</P>
<P>The nine interventions included in this review were heterogeneous in components, content, and intensity, but the intervention group used at least one dietary, physical activity, or behavioral intervention. The duration of interventions ranged from four weeks (<LINK REF="STD-Lindahl-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Lindahl 1999</LINK>) to 10 years (<LINK REF="STD-Jarrett-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Jarrett 1987</LINK>), although the latter study involved only annual contacts over the last fife years. Total contacts ranged from four (<LINK REF="STD-Dyson-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Dyson 1997</LINK>) to 78 (<LINK REF="STD-Liao-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Liao 2002</LINK>), and one study (<LINK REF="STD-Lindahl-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Lindahl 1999</LINK>) involved a 28-day in-residence lifestyle intervention. Both individual and group sessions were used. A variety of facilitators or educators were involved, but most studies involved a dietitian as a member of the care team.</P>
<P>Seven of the nine studies involved caloric restriction; one (<LINK REF="STD-Liao-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Liao 2002</LINK>) involved a diet intended to be isocaloric, with specification of the percent of total intake contributed by fats and carbohydrates, and one involved carbohydrate restriction intended to produce weight loss (<LINK REF="STD-Jarrett-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Jarrett 1987</LINK>). Diets often included a weight loss goal (<LINK REF="STD-DPP-2002" TYPE="STUDY">DPP 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mensink-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Mensink 2003</LINK>) or restrictions on fat intake (<LINK REF="STD-DPP-2002" TYPE="STUDY">DPP 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dyson-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Dyson 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mensink-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Mensink 2003</LINK>). The physical activity interventions varied from counselling to encouraging increased activity (<LINK REF="STD-Page-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Page 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pan-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Pan 1997</LINK>) to supervised sessions several times a week (<LINK REF="STD-DPP-2002" TYPE="STUDY">DPP 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Liao-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Liao 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mensink-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Mensink 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tuomilehto-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Tuomilehto 2001</LINK>) to a daily 2.5-hour-per-day aerobic session in an in-residence program <LINK REF="STD-Lindahl-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Lindahl 1999</LINK>. In one study there was no physical activity intervention <LINK REF="STD-Jarrett-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Jarrett 1987</LINK>. Behavioral interventions were used in five studies, and such interventions were very intensive in the Diabetes Prevention Program study <LINK REF="STD-DPP-2002" TYPE="STUDY">DPP 2002</LINK>, which included a variety of behavioral techniques. The other four studies were much less intensive, consisting of goal setting (<LINK REF="STD-Mensink-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Mensink 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tuomilehto-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Tuomilehto 2001</LINK>), self-feedback with food or exercise diaries ( <LINK REF="STD-Dyson-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Dyson 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Liao-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Liao 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tuomilehto-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Tuomilehto 2001</LINK>), stress management, or improved coping skills <LINK REF="STD-Lindahl-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Lindahl 1999</LINK>.</P>
<P>The comparison group interventions were fairly minimal, consisting of "usual care" or general information and counselling on diet and physical activity (<LINK REF="STD-DPP-2002" TYPE="STUDY">DPP 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dyson-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Dyson 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jarrett-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Jarrett 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lindahl-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Lindahl 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mensink-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Mensink 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Page-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Page 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pan-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Pan 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tuomilehto-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Tuomilehto 2001</LINK>). One study (<LINK REF="STD-Liao-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Liao 2002</LINK>) prescribed a diet to the comparison group, but it was less restrictive than that of the intervention group, which also received a supervised physical activity intervention.</P>

Only one trial reported on how the randomization sequence was generated (<LINK REF="STD-Tuomilehto-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Tuomilehto 2001</LINK>) and no studies documented adequate concealment of allocation.

The range of weight loss was 0.2 to 6.0 kg for the six studies with a follow-up of one year. Compared with usual care, the four studies with a follow-up interval of one year and with complete data for obtaining a pooled estimate (<LINK REF="STD-Dyson-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Dyson 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lindahl-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Lindahl 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mensink-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Mensink 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tuomilehto-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Tuomilehto 2001</LINK>) reduced weight by 2.8 kg (95% CI 1.0 to 4.7) (3.3% of baseline body weight) and decreased BMI by 1.3 kg/m<SUP>2 </SUP>(95% CI, 0.8 to 1.9) (<LINK REF="STD-Lindahl-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Lindahl 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lindstrom-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Lindstrom 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mensink-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Mensink 2003</LINK>). Statistically significant heterogeneity was noted for change in weight at one-year follow-up (I²=93.6%).</P>
<P>The pooled weight loss for the three studies that examined outcomes at two years and for which a standard error was reported (<LINK REF="STD-Liao-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Liao 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mensink-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Mensink 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tuomilehto-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Tuomilehto 2001</LINK>) was 2.6 kg (95% CI 1.9 to 3.3). The most marked mean weight change was in the lifestyle arm of the <LINK REF="STD-DPP-2002" TYPE="STUDY">DPP 2002</LINK> with a loss of 5.5 kg at an average follow-up of 2.8 years. This study population was larger than all the other study populations combined, and constituted 63% of the total population examined. Weight loss (in kg) at other follow-up intervals in the DPP was 6.0 at one year; 4.9 at two years, 4.0 at three years, and 3.2 at four years (results obtained from a graphical display of the original data). No measures of uncertainty were available for these estimates, therefore they were not included in the pooled analyses.</P>
<P>Three studies examined BMI, with a pooled effect of -1.3 (95% CI -1.9 to -0.8) at one year, and -0.8 (95% CI -1.2 to -0.5). Heterogeneity was significant at one year, however, with an I² of 87.5% (P value for Q = 0.0003). Weight loss as measured as the percent of baseline weight lost revealed similar small, but statistically significant results (<LINK REF="APP-04" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 4</LINK>).</P>
<P>Only a few studies examined other outcomes, and we believed these were insufficiently representative of all nine studies to justify pooling the effects (<LINK REF="APP-05" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 5</LINK>). Changes ranged from 0.0% to -0.3% for GHb (<LINK REF="STD-Dyson-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Dyson 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Uusitupa-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Uusitupa 2003</LINK>) and generally corresponded to changes in weight. Systolic and diastolic (data not shown) blood pressure were measured in four studies, and a small decrease was noted in most. Lipids were examined in four studies, and minor improvements were noted. There were no data on adverse events, mortality, and quality of life.</P>
<P>Five studies examined the effect of interventions on the incidence of diabetes (<LINK REF="STD-DPP-2002" TYPE="STUDY">DPP 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jarrett-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Jarrett 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Liao-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Liao 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pan-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Pan 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tuomilehto-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Tuomilehto 2001</LINK>), and three of these demonstrated a significant decrease in cumulative incidence (<LINK REF="STD-DPP-2002" TYPE="STUDY">DPP 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Li-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Li 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tuomilehto-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Tuomilehto 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Li-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Li 2002</LINK>) (<LINK REF="APP-06" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 6</LINK>). These three large trials were adequately powered to detect effects and involved intensive, sustained, multicomponent interventions.</P>
<P>We performed sensitivity analyses to examine the effect of different assumed values of the correlation between the study groups before and after the intervention, and no significant changes were noted in pooled estimates and 95% CIs (<LINK REF="APP-03" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 3</LINK>; <LINK REF="APP-04" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 4</LINK>). The characteristics of study quality were not sufficiently heterogeneous for us to examine the effects of randomization procedure, allocation concealment, or blinding on change in weight. No unpublished data were identified, so comparisons were not made among publication status. Study-level characteristics (including length of follow-up, duration of the intervention, and attrition) were examined using meta-regression, and no significant effects on weight change were noted. The total number of intervention contacts correlated positively with a decrease in weight (P value 0.015).</P>
<P>The performance of stratified (subgroup) analyses was limited by sparse data. The number of studies was insufficient to examine whether a physical activity intervention added to the effectiveness of dietary interventions.</P>
</INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>RCTs of weight loss interventions using dietary, physical activity, or behavioral interventions produced statistically significant between-group weight loss of 2 to 3 kg (3% of initial body weight) at one- and two-year follow-up. In two studies where weight was examined at longer follow-up intervals (up to 10 years), similar weight reduction was maintained. The number of intervention contacts with subjects was significantly correlated with weight loss. Data are limited, but the small number of available studies demonstrated improvements in GHb, blood pressure, and triglycerides, although these changes were for the most part not statistically significant. Although the weight loss demonstrated in this review is small, even modest loss in general populations may have health benefits; improvements in blood pressure, blood glucose, and serum lipid concentrations have been associated with weight loss (<LINK REF="REF-Anderson-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anderson 2001</LINK>), including the magnitudes noted here.</P>
<P>The findings in this review are consistent with other reviews of educational interventions for weight loss among persons with diabetes (<LINK REF="REF-Norris-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Norris 2002</LINK>) and in nondiabetic populations where comprehensive, intensive, group dietary and behavioral programs produced a mean loss of 8 -10 kg at six months with a regain of 30% to 35% of weight lost at one year ( <LINK REF="REF-Kramer-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kramer 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wadden-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wadden 2000</LINK>). The number of contacts with patients has also been shown to correlate with glycemic control in diabetes education, where attempts are made to change complex behaviors and lifestyle (<LINK REF="REF-NHLBI-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">NHLBI 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>The three studies with effective interventions for decreasing the incidence of diabetes were associated with weight loss, although the change in BMI in Pan et al. <LINK REF="STD-Pan-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Pan 1997</LINK> was only -0.4 kg/m<SUP>2 </SUP>(95% CI -0.9 to 0.1). These effective interventions demonstrate that diabetes prevention is achievable in a variety of settings in populations with prediabetes, but sustained, long-term, intensive, multicomponent interventions are required. It is noteworthy, however, that Tuomilehto et al. (<LINK REF="STD-Tuomilehto-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Tuomilehto 2001</LINK>) had somewhat fewer contacts with participants (15 over 3.2 years on average), yet achieved a 58% reduction in relative risk (P value &lt;0.001) in diabetes incidence over the course of the study. </P>
<P>Attrition is an important issue in weight-loss studies because of selective loss to follow-up <LINK REF="REF-Kaplan-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kaplan 1987</LINK>. In this review, however, mean attrition was 9.6%, perhaps because participants were most commonly self-selected and thus perhaps more motivated to complete the study. Jarrett and colleagues (<LINK REF="STD-Jarrett-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Jarrett 1987</LINK>) noted sustained weight loss at 10-year follow-up, but their attrition rate was 43%, which likely contributed to the large measured weight loss among participants who persisted with the intervention over the long term.</P>
<P>The successful interventions we examined in this review (<LINK REF="STD-DPP-2002" TYPE="STUDY">DPP 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pan-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Pan 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tuomilehto-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Tuomilehto 2001</LINK>) had prolonged frequent contacts, low attrition rates, and evidence of persisting behavior change, which likely contributed to the effectiveness of the interventions. Few data are available on changes in patterns of behaviors over time. At follow-up of the DPP (<LINK REF="STD-DPP-2002" TYPE="STUDY">DPP 2002</LINK>) (range, 1.8 to 4.6 years), 58% of participants continued to meet the goals of at least 150 minutes of self-reported physical activity per week. Total caloric and fat intake, examined at one year, decreased by 450 kcal/day in the lifestyle group and 249 kcal/day in the placebo group. Tuomilehto et al. (<LINK REF="STD-Tuomilehto-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Tuomilehto 2001</LINK>) also reported significant between-group behavior change at one year. Pan and colleagues (<LINK REF="STD-Pan-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Pan 1997</LINK>) noted no significant differences between treatment groups at six-year follow-up for daily caloric intake and calorie composition, but physical exercise was increased significantly in both the exercise group and the diet-plus-exercise group. In smaller studies, Mensink et al. (<LINK REF="STD-Mensink-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Mensink 2003</LINK>) and Page et al. (<LINK REF="STD-Page-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Page 1992</LINK>) demonstrated improved dietary habits at one and two years, respectively. Considering both attrition from study programs and recidivism with respect to positive lifestyle changes, the applicability of the results of these studies to general populations of persons with prediabetes is unclear. Behavioral (<LINK REF="REF-Jeffery-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jeffery 2000</LINK>) and environmental (<LINK REF="REF-French-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">French 2001</LINK>) barriers to weight loss abound; populations that are not self-selected or participating in a research study might demonstrate less pronounced improvements in behavior and weight.</P>
<P>Lindahl and colleagues had a very successful intervention with 1 year follow-up (<LINK REF="STD-Lindahl-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Lindahl 1999</LINK>), contributing to the high level of heterogeneity noted in the pooled effect at 1 year. This intervention was different from others: it was a residential treatment program with close, daily, supervision and 2.5 hours of physical activity each day. The comparison group was usual care.</P>
<P>With 63% of all participants studied in the meta-analyses from the DPP, that study had the largest impact on the results of the meta-analyses. However, the use of a random-effects model to combine studies accounts for between-study heterogeneity, thus weighting each study more equally than pure sample size would indicate. This approach recognizes potential heterogeneity among the different interventions and settings in which the research was conducted and increases the generalizability of our results. </P>
<P>Pharmacotherapy and surgery have been used to help prevent the progression of IGT to diabetes and may be important adjuncts to lifestyle interventions in the future. In the DPP (<LINK REF="STD-DPP-2002" TYPE="STUDY">DPP 2002</LINK>) the study group receiving metformin lost a mean of 2.1 kg at an average follow-up of 2.8 years, and had a relative decrease in the incidence of diabetes of 31%. These outcomes were less pronounced than those achieved with the lifestyle intervention, however. The weight loss agent orlistat, a pancreatic lipase inhibitor, is currently being studied in the XENDOS study: at four-year follow-up a comparison of a lifestyle intervention with orlistat revealed a significant decrease in weight (2.8 kg compared to the control group) and a relative risk reduction of 37.2% in the cumulative incidence of type 2 diabetes (<LINK REF="REF-Scheen-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scheen 2002</LINK>). The Troglitazone in Prevention of Diabetes (TRIPOD) study has shown a 56% relative reduction in the progression to diabetes in Hispanic women with previous gestational diabetes at median follow-up of 30 months (<LINK REF="REF-Buchanen-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Buchanen 2002</LINK>). In the STOP-NIDDM trial, a 25% reduction in relative risk for progression to diabetes was noted at 3.3 years in the group using the alpha-glucosidase inhibitor acarbose <LINK REF="REF-Chaisson-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chaisson 2002</LINK>. Other drugs have been associated with a decreased incidence of diabetes in <I>post hoc</I> analyses of initially normoglycemic populations, including captopril (<LINK REF="REF-Hansson-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hansson 1999</LINK>), ramipril (<LINK REF="REF-Yusuf-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yusuf 2001</LINK>), and pravastatin (<LINK REF="REF-Freeman-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Freeman 2001</LINK>), and with estrogen-progestin combination therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Kanaya-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kanaya 2003</LINK>). Weight loss from bariatric surgery has also been shown to significantly decrease the progression of IGT to diabetes (<LINK REF="REF-Long-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Long 1994</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Sjostrom-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sjostrom 2000</LINK>). </P>
<P>This review is limited to published studies; although subject experts were contacted for additional unpublished literature, none was obtained. The quality of individual studies in this review varied, and some common deficiencies were noted: in particular, randomization procedures and allocation concealment were rarely reported. In addition, the studies included were heterogeneous with respect to population, setting, and intervention, and the data were very limited for most outcomes. Quantitative synthesis was therefore not justified for most outcomes, and the pooled effect for weight loss at one year must be interpreted with caution. </P>
<P>Whether the benefits of weight loss in persons with prediabetes differ from those in persons with diabetes (<LINK REF="REF-Williamson-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Williamson 2000</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Wing-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wing 1987</LINK>) in terms of macrovascular and microvascular disease remains to be seen. Is primary prevention of diabetes among high risk adults any different from the treatment of diabetes? Certainly, insulin sensitivity and glycemia represent a spectrum, and persons with glucose concentrations below those defined for diabetes have significantly greater risk of cardiovascular disease than persons with normoglycemia (<LINK REF="REF-DECODE-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">DECODE 2001</LINK>). Preventing and treating diabetes are different, however: the current clinical approaches differ by frequency of laboratory and clinical testing, guidelines for blood pressure and lipid values differ, persons with diabetes are at risk for acute complications such as hyperglycemia, and microvascular complications are not well documented in prediabetes <LINK REF="REF-ADA-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">ADA 2004</LINK>. Thus it is as yet unclear whether similar treatment strategies and goals for weight, lipids, glycemia, and blood pressure are warranted in prediabetes.</P>

<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2008-10-27 13:02:30 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gudrun Paletta">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>Small improvements in weight and in other cardiovascular disease risk factors appear achievable in populations with prediabetes. Further research is needed to examine the effect of these interventions on morbidity and mortality and their effectiveness in other high-risk populations. Work is also needed to explore translation and implementation of these results in the community setting.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2008-10-27 13:02:30 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gudrun Paletta">
<P>Future research needs to focus on how best to sustain interventions and behavioral change, and long-term outcomes such as cardiovascular events and mortality need further study. Researchers need to explore the effectiveness of interventions shown to work in populations with IGT and in other populations (for example, those with isolated IFG, the metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes, overweight, or obesity). There is some information available on the effectiveness of these interventions when nonselective community recruitment is used (<LINK REF="STD-Lindahl-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Lindahl 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mensink-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Mensink 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pan-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Pan 1997</LINK>), but further research needs to explore whether and how to translate these results to broadly defined communities. Should interventions focus on diet and physical activity change specifically, or more broadly on the social determinants of behavior and disease, such as social status or empowerment (<LINK REF="REF-Syme-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Syme 2004</LINK>)? The role of diet versus physical activity interventions for weight loss in persons with prediabetes needs additional study. Physical activity interventions demonstrate benefits among persons with diabetes, independent of weight loss (<LINK REF="REF-Boule-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boule 2001</LINK>), and some data support a positive effect of physical activity on the incidence of diabetes that is independent of weight loss (<LINK REF="REF-Kelley-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kelley 2001</LINK>). The role of other weight loss strategies (in isolation or in combination with dietary, activity or behavioral interventions), such as pharmacotherapy (<LINK REF="REF-Norris-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Norris 2004</LINK>), surgical interventions, or public health interventions (such as changes in the physical and social environments), remains to be determined. Further research is needed on weight control strategies and obesity prevention.</P>
