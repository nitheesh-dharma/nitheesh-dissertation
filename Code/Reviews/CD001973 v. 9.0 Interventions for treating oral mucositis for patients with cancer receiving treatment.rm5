<P>Using a low level laser may reduce the severity of ulcers caused by cancer treatment.<BR/>Treatments for cancer can cause severe ulcers (sores) in the mouth. These can be painful and slow to heal. The review found some evidence that using a laser relieves or cures the ulcers. Morphine can control the pain. Although using morphine automatically on a constant drip, or self controlled use, provide similar relief, people use less morphine when they are controlling it themselves.</P>

<P>To assess the effectiveness of interventions for treating oral mucositis or its associated pain in patients with cancer receiving chemotherapy or radiotherapy or both. </P>

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2010-06-10 15:28:44 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Littlewood">
<P>Electronic searches of Cochrane Oral Health Group and PaPaS Trials Registers (to 1 June 2010), CENTRAL via <I>The Cochrane Library</I> (to Issue 2, 2010), MEDLINE via OVID (1950 to 1 June 2010), EMBASE via OVID (1980 to 1 June 2010), CINAHL via EBSCO (1980 to 1 June 2010), CANCERLIT via PubMed (1950 to 1 June 2010), OpenSIGLE (1980 to 1 June 2010) and LILACS via the Virtual Health Library (1980 to 1 June 2010) were undertaken. Reference lists from relevant articles were searched and the authors of eligible trials were contacted to identify trials and obtain additional information.<BR/>
</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>All randomised controlled trials comparing agents prescribed to treat oral mucositis in people receiving chemotherapy or radiotherapy or both. Outcomes were oral mucositis, time to heal mucositis, oral pain, duration of pain control, dysphagia, systemic infection, amount of analgesia, length of hospitalisation, cost and quality of life.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2010-04-08 14:29:36 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Helen Worthington">
<P>Data were independently extracted, in duplicate, by two review authors. Authors were contacted for details of randomisation, blindness and withdrawals. Risk of bias assessment was carried out on six domains. The Cochrane Collaboration statistical guidelines were followed and risk ratio (RR) values calculated using fixed-effect models (less than 3 trials in each meta-analysis).</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2010-07-06 12:11:28 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Thirty-two trials involving 1505 patients satisfied the inclusion criteria. Three comparisons for mucositis treatment including two or more trials were: benzydamine HCl versus placebo, sucralfate versus placebo and low level laser versus sham procedure. Only the low level laser showed a reduction in severe mucositis when compared with the sham procedure, RR 5.28 (95% confidence interval (CI) 2.30 to 12.13).</P>
<P>Only 3 comparisons included more than one trial for pain control: patient controlled analgesia (PCA) compared to the continuous infusion method, therapist versus control, cognitive behaviour therapy versus control. There was no evidence of a difference in mean pain score between PCA and continuous infusion, however, less opiate was used per hour for PCA, mean difference 0.65 mg/hour (95% CI 0.09 to 1.20), and the duration of pain was less 1.9 days (95% CI 0.3 to 3.5).</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2010-08-24 14:58:36 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is limited evidence from two small trials that low level laser treatment reduces the severity of the mucositis. Less opiate is used for PCA versus continuous infusion. Further, well designed, placebo or no treatment controlled trials assessing the effectiveness of interventions investigated in this review and new interventions for treating mucositis are needed.</P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2010-08-24 14:57:34 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2010-07-06 12:14:12 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Treatment of malignant diseases with cytotoxic chemotherapy or radiotherapy or both, is becoming increasingly more effective but it is associated with short and long term side effects. Among the clinically important acute side effects is disruption in the function and integrity of the oral mucosa. The consequences of this include severe ulceration (oral mucositis) and fungal infection of the mouth (oral candidiasis). These disease and treatment induced complications may also produce oral discomfort and pain, poor nutrition, delays in administration of chemotherapy or radiotherapy, reductions in the doses of chemotherapy drugs, increased length of inpatient stays and associated economic costs and in some patients life threatening infection (septicaemia in neutropenic patients).</P>
<P>Oral complications remain a major source of illness despite the use of a variety of agents to prevent them. There are variations in usage between cancer centres in terms of the mouthcare regimen used. Compliance with recommended use of product is variable and there are conflicting reports of the effectiveness of prophylactic agents. The qualitative and quantitative benefits, side effects and costs of oral therapies are of importance to the cancer teams responsible for the treatment of patients.</P>
<P>There have been several traditional reviews published and most of these present a general discussion for both chemotherapy and radiotherapy induced oral side effects (<LINK REF="REF-De-Pauw-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">De Pauw 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Denning-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Denning 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Knox-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Knox 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lortholary-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lortholary 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Plevova-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Plevova 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shaw-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shaw 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stevens-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stevens 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Symonds-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Symonds 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Verdi-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Verdi 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-White-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">White 1993</LINK>). The conclusions drawn and recommendations made vary from advocating a particular therapy to recommending oral care procedures that have not been systematically investigated. Five systematic reviews, which were not Cochrane reviews, have focused on the prevention and treatment of oral mucositis in patients with cancer. One older review published in 1998 concluded that for most strategies reviewed there is insufficient evidence to draw any conclusions regarding their effectiveness (<LINK REF="REF-Kowanko-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kowanko 1998</LINK>). The other three more recent reviews focused on patients with head and neck cancer only (<LINK REF="REF-Shih-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shih 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sutherland-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sutherland 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Trotti-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Trotti 2003</LINK>), and two were unable to draw definite conclusions regarding the effectiveness of any of the agents tested, however in the <LINK REF="REF-Sutherland-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sutherland 2001</LINK> review the main analysis combined all the interventions in one meta-analysis and found a beneficial effect of prophylactic interventions. This pooling of interventions is impossible to interpret and therefore not helpful.</P>
<P>A systematic review looking at antimicrobial therapy to prevent or treat mucositis identified 31 prospective trials (not just randomised trials) of which 13 reported some benefit. The review concludes that there is no clear pattern emerging regarding the benefit or otherwise of antimicrobial use to manage mucositis, and there is limited evidence supporting the use of antimicrobial agents for reducing oral mucositis (<LINK REF="REF-Donnelly-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Donnelly 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>Another review looked at granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) for the prevention and treatment of oral mucositis (<LINK REF="REF-Fung-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fung 2002</LINK>). This review included studies of different types including some with historical controls. The authors conclude that although there are published studies, these studies are limited and the use of systemic or topical GM-CSF cannot be recommended for prevention or treatment of mucositis.</P>
<P>This review is part of a series of four Cochrane reviews looking at the prevention and treatment of oral mucositis and oral candidiasis in patients with cancer receiving treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Worthington-2007a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Worthington 2007a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Clarkson-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clarkson 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Worthington-2007b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Worthington 2007b</LINK>). The review for the prevention of oral mucositis (<LINK REF="REF-Worthington-2007b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Worthington 2007b</LINK>) found 11 out of the 33 interventions investigated showed some evidence of a benefit (albeit sometimes weak) for either preventing or reducing the severity of mucositis. Interventions with more than one trial were amifostine, Chinese medicine, hydrolytic enzymes and ice chips (cryotherapy). Interventions with only one study were: benzydamine, calcium phosphate, etoposide bolus, honey, iseganan, oral care and zinc sulphate. This review is currently being updated and will be published in 2010.</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2010-07-06 12:14:19 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>To assess the effectiveness of interventions (which may include placebo or no treatment) for the treatment of oral mucositis or its associated pain for patients with cancer receiving chemotherapy or radiotherapy or both. The following null hypotheses were tested, against alternative hypotheses of a difference, for comparisons between groups treated for mucositis.<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>There is no difference in the proportion of patients with improvement in mucositis after treatment for mucositis.</LI>
<LI>There is no difference in the proportion of patients with mucositis eradicated after treatment for mucositis.</LI>
<LI>There is no difference in the proportion of patients with severe mucositis (&#8805;grade 3) after treatment for mucositis</LI>
<LI>There is no difference in the mean number of days taken to heal.</LI>
<LI>There is no difference in the mean pain scores after treatment or analgesia for mucositis.</LI>
</UL>
<P>The review is divided into two parts, one concerning interventions for the treatment of mucositis and one concerning the control of the pain in patients with mucositis.<BR/>
<BR/>In this review we also addressed the hypothesis of no difference between groups treated for mucositis for the following outcomes if data were available from studies which included a primary outcome:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>relief of dysphagia (problems during eating);</LI>
<LI>incidence of systemic infection;</LI>
<LI>amount of analgesia;</LI>
<LI>days stay in hospital;</LI>
<LI>cost of oral care;</LI>
<LI>patient quality of life.</LI>
</UL>
<P>The following subgroup analyses were proposed a priori:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>cancer type (head and neck, other solid tumours, leukaemia, and mixed);</LI>
<LI>cancer treatment type;</LI>
<LI>age group (children, adults, children and adults).</LI>

<P>This review is part of a series of four reviews on the prevention and treatment of oral candidiasis and oral mucositis in patients with cancer, and the same search strategies were used for all four reviews.<BR/>The searches attempted to identify all relevant trials irrespective of language. Papers not in English were translated by members of The Cochrane Collaboration. Sensitive search strategies were developed for each database using a combination of free text and MeSH terms. The MEDLINE and CANCERLIT searches combined the subject search with the <I>Cochrane Highly Sensitive Search Strategy (CHSSS) for identifying randomized trials in MEDLINE: sensitivity maximising version (2009 revision) </I>as referenced in Chapter 6.4.11.1 and detailed in boxes 6.4a and 6.4.c of <I>The Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions </I>Version 5.0.2 [updated September 2009] (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2009</LINK>). The EMBASE and CINAHL searches were combined with sensitive search strategies developed by the Cochrane Oral Health Group for identifying RCTs. The LILACs subject search was combined with the Brazilian Cochrane Centre search strategy for identifying RCTs in LILACS.</P>
<P>Electronic searching - the databases searched were:<BR/>Cochrane Oral Health Group Trials Register (to 1 June 2010) (see <LINK REF="APP-01" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 1</LINK>)<BR/>Cochrane Pain, Palliative and Supportive Care (PaPaS) Group Trials Register (to 1 June 2010) (see <LINK REF="APP-01" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 1</LINK>)<BR/>Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (via <I>The Cochrane Library</I> 2010, Issue 2, 1 June 2010) (see <LINK REF="APP-02" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 2</LINK>)<BR/>MEDLINE and MEDLINE Pre-indexed via OVID (1950 to 1 June 2010) (see <LINK REF="APP-03" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 3</LINK>)<BR/>EMBASE via OVID (1980 to 1 June 2010) (see <LINK REF="APP-04" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 4</LINK>)<BR/>CINAHL via EBSCO (1980 to 1 June 2010) (see <LINK REF="APP-05" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 5</LINK>)<BR/>CANCERLIT via PubMed (1950 to 1 June 2010) (see <LINK REF="APP-06" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 6</LINK>)<BR/>OpenSIGLE (1980 to 1 June 2010) (see <LINK REF="APP-07" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 7</LINK>)<BR/>LILACS via The Virtual Health Library (see <LINK REF="APP-08" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 8</LINK>).</P>
<P>Only handsearching carried out by The Cochrane Collaboration was included in the search (<I>see</I> master list <A HREF="http://www.cochrane.org">www.cochrane.org</A>).</P>
<P>The controlled trials database (<A HREF="http://www.controlled-trials.com">www.controlled-trials.com</A>) was also searched to identify ongoing and completed trials and to contact trialists for further information about these trials.</P>
<P>The reference list of related review articles and all articles obtained were checked for further trials. Authors of trial reports and specialists in the field known to the review authors were written to concerning further published and unpublished trials.</P>
<P>The review will be updated every 2 years using the Cochrane Oral Health Group Trials Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, CANCERLIT and LILACS. The search of OpenSIGLE was discontinued as this database ceased being updated in 2005.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Selection of studies</HEADING>
<P>The titles and abstracts (when available) of all reports identified through the searches were scanned by two review authors. Full reports were obtained for trials appearing to meet the inclusion criteria or for which there was insufficient information in the title and abstract to make a clear decision. The full reports obtained from all the electronic and other methods of searching were assessed independently, in duplicate, by two review authors to establish whether the trials met the inclusion criteria or not. Disagreements were resolved by discussion.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Data extraction and management</HEADING>
<P>Data were extracted by two review authors independently using specially designed data extraction forms. The characteristics of the trial participants, interventions and outcomes for the included trials are presented in the study tables. Mucositis may be dichotomised at different levels of severity. In order to maximise the availability of similar outcome data, we recorded the number of patients in each category of mucositis usually on a 0 to 4 scale, and used the following dichotomies: 0 versus 1+, 0-1 versus 2+, 0-2 versus 3+. Pain was assessed on visual analogue scales (0 to 100), the means and standard deviations for each group were recorded. The duration of trials and timing of assessments were recorded in order to make a decision about which to include for commonality. We also recorded the country where the trial was conducted and whether a dentist was involved in the investigation. Authors of full study reports and abstracts identified were contacted for clarification or for further information.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Assessment of risk of bias in included studies</HEADING>
<P>This was conducted using the recommended approach for assessing risk of bias in studies included in Cochrane reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2009</LINK>). It is a two-part tool, addressing the six specific domains (namely sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding, incomplete outcome data, selective outcome reporting and &#8216;other issues&#8217;). Each domain includes one or more specific entries in a &#8216;Risk of bias&#8217; table. Within each entry, the first part of the tool involves describing what was reported to have happened in the study. The second part of the tool involves assigning a judgement relating to the risk of bias for that entry. This is achieved by answering a pre-specified question about the adequacy of the study in relation to the entry, such that a judgement of &#8216;Yes&#8217; indicates low risk of bias, &#8216;No&#8217; indicates high risk of bias, and &#8216;Unclear&#8217; indicates unclear or unknown risk of bias.</P>
<P>The domains of sequence generation, allocation concealment, incomplete outcome data and selective outcome reporting are each addressed in the tool by a single entry for each study. For blinding two entries were used because assessments need to be made separately for a) patients and carers and b) outcome assessor. The final domain (&#8216;other sources of bias&#8217;) was assessed as a single entry for studies as a whole.</P>
<P>The risk of bias assessment was undertaken independently and in duplicate by two review authors as part of the data extraction process.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Summarising risk of bias for a study:</HEADING>
<P>After taking into account the additional information provided by the authors of the trials, studies were grouped into the following categories. We assumed that the risk of bias was the same for all outcomes and each study was assessed as follows:</P>

</TABLE>
<P>A risk of bias table was completed for each included study (<LINK TAG="STUDY_QUALITY" TYPE="SECTION">Risk of bias in included studies</LINK>). Results are presented graphically by study (see <LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>) and by domain over all studies (<LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>) .</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Measure of treatment effect</HEADING>
<P>For dichotomous outcomes, the estimates of effect of an intervention were expressed as risk ratios together with 95% confidence intervals. For continuous outcomes mean differences together with 95% confidence intervals were used.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Dealing with missing data</HEADING>
<P>Intention-to-treat analyses were conducted if possible. Methods outlined the handbook (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2009</LINK>) were used to impute missing standard deviations if these could not be obtained from authors.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Assessment of heterogeneity</HEADING>
<P>The significance of any discrepancies in the estimates of the treatment effects from the different trials was assessed by means of Cochran's test for heterogeneity and quantified by I<SUP>2</SUP> statistics. Heterogeneity was considered statistically significant if P value was &lt; 0.1. A rough guide to the interpretation of I<SUP>2</SUP> given in the Handbook is: 0 to 40% might not be important, 30 to 60% may represent moderate heterogeneity, 50 to 90% may represent substantial heterogeneity, 75 to 100% considerable heterogeneity (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2009</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Assessment of reporting biases</HEADING>
<P>We tabulated all the outcomes considered here.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Data synthesis</HEADING>
<P>Meta-analyses were done only with studies of similar comparisons. Risk ratios were combined for dichotomous data using random-effects models (fixed-effect models used if less than 3 studies in meta-analysis).</P>
<P>It was planned to undertake a sensitivity analysis to examine the effect of concealed allocation and blind outcome assessment on the overall estimates of effect. However there were insufficient trials to undertake this.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity</HEADING>
<P>We proposed a priori to conduct subgroup analyses for different cancer types (head and neck, other solid tumours, haematological and mixed), cancer treatment (chemotherapy, radiotherapy) and age groups (children, adults and mixed).</P>
<P>We planned to investigate clinical heterogeneity by examining the different cancer types and age groups.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2010-08-24 14:56:43 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Oral mucositis is a common and painful complication of cancer chemotherapy and radiotherapy.It can limit the tolerability of therapy, leading to reductions in treatment and, therefore, potentially limiting treatment efficacy (Kowanko 1998).This review updates the evidence for the efficacy of interventions to treat mucositis and another Cochrane review looks at the evidence for preventing mucositis (<LINK REF="REF-Worthington-2007b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Worthington 2007b</LINK>).</P>
<P>Since our original reviews there has been an expansion of evidence in this area of cancer care.The number and range of interventions have increased.In addition, the last 5 years have seen increasingly frequent reporting of outcomes other than the presence or absence of mucositis.As a result, two new outcomes were included in our previous update (2005) of this review: time taken to heal mucositis and duration of pain control therapy.Our current update includes a further outcome: the severity of mucositis.To reflect the increased number and range of studies the review has been split into two parts, one evaluating the effectiveness of agents to treat mucositis and the other the management of pain associated with the condition.There has been increasing recognition that other endpoints, such as oral intake (ability to take fluids or solid food by mouth), quality of life and duration of hospital stay, may be clinically more relevant and more important to patients (<LINK REF="REF-Bellm-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bellm 2002</LINK>).Unfortunately, there was insufficient data to include these more patient-oriented endpoints in this review nor was there data on systemic infection and use of antibiotics. Whilst this latter outcome is often cited as a possible consequence of mucositis it may be due to other causes.</P>
<P>The broad scope of interventions included in this review indicate the importance of this condition to clinicians and the uncertainty of how to manage it optimally.The 32 trials included have recruited 1505 patients and evaluated 27 different interventions.Of all the interventions examined in this review only three mucositis treatments were investigated by more than one trial and only one comparison was significant for one outcome: low level laser treatment was found to reduce the severity of mucositis. There were only three comparisons for pain control which included more than one trial, only one of which showed a statistically significant effect. There was no evidence to suggest that there was a difference in pain control between continuous infusion and patient controlled analgesia (PCA).However, the PCA group required less morphine than the continuous infusion group, and the pain lasted for 2 days less.</P>
<P>For the remainder of the comparisons of treatment and pain control examined in this review, a lack of duplication of studies by independent groups investigating the same interventions limits the strength of evidence and generalisability of the results. Our review agrees with two systematic reviews looking at antimicrobial therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Donnelly-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Donnelly 2003</LINK>) and GM-CSF (<LINK REF="REF-Fung-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fung 2002</LINK>) for the prevention and treatment of oral mucositis. There is no clear pattern emerging regarding the benefit or otherwise of antimicrobial use to manage mucositis.Studies looking at GM-CSF are limited and the use of GM-CSF cannot currently be recommended for the treatment of mucositis.</P>
<P>Several issues identified in this review may have affected the validity of the results.The setting of the included trials varied with the majority being conducted by medical teams who did not report any involvement with a dentist or hygienist (68%).None of the trials assessed the reliability of the outcome measures used, particularly with regard to the presence or absence of oral candidiasis.The appearance of mucositis and oral candidiasis can be similar; leading to potential mis-diagnosis if the assessors were not sufficiently trained or experienced in the diagnosis of these oral lesions. Several different scoring systems were used to assess mucositis severity and in some studies the scoring systems were not defined.This variability may have led to discrepancies between studies.Accepting that caveat, there was consistency in the number of categories used and in every case the lowest score indicated no mucositis.Only four of the included studies reported power calculations a priori (<LINK REF="STD-Genot_x002d_Klastersky-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Genot-Klastersky 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Loprinzi-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Loprinzi 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Masucci-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Masucci 2005</LINK>) and one trial reported a post hoc power calculation as an explanation for their findings (<LINK REF="STD-Schubert-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Schubert 1987</LINK>). It is possible that some studies which found no difference between treatments compared were underpowered. With respect to publication bias, several negative studies for mucositis have been reported and we congratulate the authors and editors for doing so.It was not possible to detect any existing publication bias, as there were insufficient studies in each meta-analysis investigating the same interventions.</P>
<P>The country of conduct, financial support and the design of trials varied greatly between studies.It was especially unfortunate that six studies presented data in an unusable form.We feel that the use of structured abstracts and adherence to the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) guidelines will greatly improve the reporting and hopefully the conduct of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) (<LINK REF="REF-Begg-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Begg 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moher-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>For patients being treated for cancer the decision-making around giving potentially toxic therapy to prevent mucositis versus treating mucositis once it is established can be a clinical dilemma.Our recent review of interventions to prevent mucositis identified a small number of interventions with weak, unreliable evidence of benefit.This review of therapies for established mucositis shows limited evidence, from two small trials including a total of 57 participants, that low level laser treatment reduced mucositis severity, and unreliable evidence that opiate delivered by PCA results in a lower total dose of opiate, and improved duration of pain control compared to delivery by a continuous infusion.Given the pain and inconvenience that mucositis causes to a population of patients receiving treatment for cancer it is important that further, well designed, RCTs should be conducted investigating new treatments for the management of mucositis and new ways of controlling pain.Future studies should include more patient-oriented outcomes in addition to measures of mucositis severity.</P>

<P>There is limited evidence that low level laser treatment is beneficial in reducing the severity of mucositis. There is no evidence that patient controlled analgesia is better than continuous infusion method for controlling pain. However there is unreliable evidence that less opiate is used per hour, and the duration of pain is slightly reduced with patient controlled analgesia.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2010-07-01 16:30:21 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is a need for further, well designed trials, preferably including a placebo or no treatment control, assessing the effectiveness of interventions considered in this review and new interventions for managing oral mucositis. These should be reported according to the CONSORT guidelines. Consideration should be given to the adoption of standard clinical outcome measures, the development of patient based outcome measures and inclusion of the cost of the interventions.</P>

<PUBLIC_NOTES>
<P>Changes from protocol.<BR/>The title has changed.<BR/>The hypotheses have changed. The original first hypothesis has been expanded into two hypotheses one for eradication and one for improvement of mucositis. The second original hypothesis has been changed from "there is no difference in the proportion of patients with relief of pain" to "there is no difference in the mean pain scores". This change was made as all studies reported pain as mean and standard deviations of VAS scores.<BR/>

<P>"I ask you to file and publish the following comment:</P>
<P>There seems to be an imbalance in the way that low level laser therapy (LLLT) is handled in the risk of bias assessment and the review conclusion. The two LLLT-studies receive the highest method scores of the review with 7/7 and 6/7 points, respectively, and no red circles for high bias risk in the assessments. Still in the results section, the Kuhn (6/7) LLLT study is classified as having high risk of bias. Although the scientific evidence may be classified as limited for LLLT in oral mucositis, I cannot see that the published conclusion of weak and unreliable evidence is justified for studies receiving such extraordinarily high method scores. Another matter is that the review only includes less than half of the published LLLT trials in cancer therapy-induced oral mucositis."</P>
</FEEDBACK_SUMMARY>
<FEEDBACK_REPLY MODIFIED="2010-08-24 15:16:19 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The Kuhn 2009 study was correctly assessed as being at unclear risk of bias under the heading Effects of Interventions- Laser versus sham treatment, but was not included in the group at unclear risk of bias, under the heading Risk of Bias. This error has been corrected. </P>
<P>We have amended the text in the Abstract, Results &amp; Discussion sections concerning low level laser therapy, deleting the word unreliable and describing the evidence as limited. The term 'unreliable' has been added to the description of the evidence for patient controlled analgesia as these trials are at either unclear or high risk of bias.</P>
<P>We believe that we have included all of the trials of low level laser therapy for the <I>treatment</I> of oral mucositis that meet the inclusion criteria for this review. An update of a second systematic review of interventions for the <I>prevention</I> of oral mucositis is nearing completion and is due to be published later this year. We would be grateful if Professor Bjordal could send us information about other trials that he believes should be included in these review(s).</P>
<P>We would like to thank Professor Bjordal for taking the time to bring these matters to our attention. </P>
