<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2008-02-07 15:54:47 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is no evidence from trials about the optimum depth for catheter insertion when suctioning clear the endotracheal tube in babies in neonatal intensive care. Babies in neonatal intensive care often need mechanical ventilation to assist breathing. This involves inserting an endotracheal tube (ETT) down the baby's windpipe so that a machine ventilator can help the baby breathe. Lung secretions can build up in the tube and cause blockages. Build-up is minimized by suctioning the ETT clear with a catheter (small tube). One of the variations of technique possible for suctioning is depth of catheter insertion into the ETT. However, the review found no trials to show what depth of insertion of catheter into the endotracheal tube gains optimal clearance without damaging the baby's lungs.</P>

<P>Mechanical ventilation is commonly used in Neonatal Intensive Care Units to assist breathing in a variety of conditions. Mechanical ventilation is achieved through the placement of an endotracheal tube (ETT) which is left <I>in-situ</I>. The ETT is suctioned to prevent a build-up of secretions and blockage of the airway. Methods of suctioning the endotracheal tube vary according to institutional practice and the individual clinician performing the task. The depth of suctioning is one of these variables. The catheter may be passed to the tip of the ETT or beyond the tip into the trachea or bronchi to facilitate removal of secretions. However, trauma to the lower airways may result from the suction catheter being passed into the airway beyond the tip of the endotracheal tube.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2011-06-05 18:35:41 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Mechanical ventilation is commonly used to assist breathing in a variety of conditions in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit. Mechanical ventilation is achieved through the placement of an endotracheal tube that is left <I>in-situ</I>. There are a number of potential problems associated with this intervention. Tube blockage, discomfort, hypoxaemia, hypercapnia and lobar collapse are all possible complications associated with endotracheal tubes.</P>
<P>The presence of the endotracheal tube causes soft tissue irritation and increased secretions due to suppression of normal ciliary action. In addition, the infant is unable to cough (<LINK REF="REF-Sturges-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sturges 1979</LINK>), which reduces the ability to clear secretions. The aim of endotracheal suctioning is to reduce the problems resulting from a build-up of secretions and, therefore, possible tube obstruction. Documented complications associated with endotracheal suctioning include hypoxaemia, bradycardia, tachycardia, atelectasis, pneumonia, fluctuations in blood pressure and intracranial pressure, localised trauma to the airway, sepsis, tube blockage, and tube dislodgement (<LINK REF="REF-Boothroyd-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boothroyd 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Simbruner-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Simbruner 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gunderson-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gunderson 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Brodsky-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brodsky 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Durand-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Durand 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shorten-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shorten 1991</LINK>).</P>
<P>Protocols for maintaining patency of the endotracheal tube vary widely among institutions and are not, in general, based on sound evidence (<LINK REF="REF-Tolles-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tolles 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Copnell-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Copnell 1995</LINK>). Potentially harmful suctioning techniques such as frequent and deep suctioning, head turning, and multiple catheter passes have been questioned (<LINK REF="REF-Wrightson-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wrightson 1999</LINK>). However, much of the practice of suctioning endotracheal tubes appears to be based on ritual rather than a physiological rationale or reliable evidence. Endotracheal tube suctioning remains a routine practice in the neonatal intensive care unit (<LINK REF="REF-Cameron-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cameron 2000</LINK>) with different practices across NICU's. Therefore, it is important that methods of suctioning the endotracheal tube that minimise complications are identified and implemented into practice.</P>
<P>There have been many protocols and guidelines published to assist caregivers in determining the most appropriate method for suctioning endotracheal tubes in neonates (<LINK REF="REF-Hodge-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hodge 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Runton-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Runton 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Knox_x002c_-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Knox, 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Young-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Young 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wrightson-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wrightson 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pollard-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pollard 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-AARC-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">AARC 2010</LINK>). However, surveys from practice indicate that protocols vary widely and are not, in general, based on sound evidence (<LINK REF="REF-Tolles-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tolles 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Copnell-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Copnell 1995</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2011-06-15 20:09:04 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The traditional method of deep suctioning appears to have been based on the concern that shallow suctioning would result in inadequate removal of secretions and subsequent tube blockage has increased the practice of deep suctioning (<LINK REF="REF-Bailey-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bailey 1988</LINK>). Although some research had shown that deep suction into the bronchial tree increases the mucous obtained on suction (<LINK REF="REF-Bailey-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bailey 1988</LINK>), others have reported that the removal of secretions using a dry shallow technique was adequate for obtaining samples of mucous (<LINK REF="REF-Darlow-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Darlow 1997</LINK>). Trauma to the lower airways may result from deep suctioning due to the suction catheter being passed into the airway beyond the tip of the endotracheal tube (<LINK REF="REF-Miller-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Miller 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Brodsky-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brodsky 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bailey-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bailey 1988</LINK>) and from repeated insult from suction catheters (<LINK REF="REF-Grylack-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grylack 1984</LINK>). In addition, deep suctioning has been associated with lobar collapse (<LINK REF="REF-Boothroyd-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boothroyd 1996</LINK>) and pneumothorax (<LINK REF="REF-Jaw-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jaw 1991</LINK>) in paediatric patients. Because of this potential for airway damage, several authors have recommended that shallow suctioning should be used (<LINK REF="REF-Bailey-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bailey 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Runton-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Runton 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Harling-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harling 2000</LINK>), but deep suctioning is still commonly used in the care of neonates and young infants (<LINK REF="REF-Bailey-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bailey 1988</LINK>) and there remains little evidence for the relative benefits and risks of the two types of suctioning (<LINK REF="REF-Morrow-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morrow 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gardner-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gardner 2009</LINK>).</P>

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2011-06-15 19:46:52 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The standard methods of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group were employed. </P>
<P>The reviewers independently assessed risk of bias for each study using the criteria outlined in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of interventions (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). Disagreements were resolved by discussion. </P>
<P>We completed the Risk of Bias table addressing the following methodological issues: </P>
<P>1. Sequence generation: Was the allocation sequence adequately generated? For each included study we described the method used to generate the allocation sequence.We assessed the methods as:</P>
<P>- low risk (any truly random process, e.g. random number table; computer random number generator);</P>
<P>- high risk (any non-random process, e.g. odd or even date of birth; hospital or clinic record number);</P>
<P>- unclear risk.</P>
<P>2. Allocation concealment: Was allocation adequately concealed? For each included study, we described the method used to conceal the allocation sequence and determined whether intervention allocation could have been foreseen in advance of, or during recruitment, of changed after assignment. We assessed the methods as:</P>
<P>- low risk (e.g. telephone or central randomisation; consecutively numbered sealed opaque envelopes);</P>
<P>- high risk (open random allocation; unsealed or non-opaque envelopes, alternation; date of birth);</P>
<P>- unclear risk.</P>
<P>3. Blinding of participants, personnel and outcome assessors: Was knowledge of the allocated intervention adequately prevented during the study? We assessed the methods as:</P>
<P>- low risk;</P>
<P>- high risk;</P>
<P>- unclear risk.</P>
<P>4. Incomplete outcome data: Were incomplete outcome data adequately addressed? For each included study and for each outcome, we described the completeness of data including attrition and exclusions from the analysis. We stated whether attrition and exclusions were reported, the numbers included in the analysis at each stage (compared with the total randomised participants), reasons for attrition or exclusion where reported, and whether missing data were balanced across groups or were related to outcomes. We assessed the methods as:</P>
<P>- low risk;</P>
<P>- high risk;</P>
<P>- unclear risk.</P>
<P>5. Selective outcome reporting: Are reports of the study free of suggestion of selective outcome reporting? For each included study we described how we examined the possibility of selective outcome reporting bias and what we found. We assessed the methods as:</P>
<P>- low risk (where it is clear that all of the study's pre-specified outcomes and all expected outcomes of interest to the review have been reported);</P>
<P>- high risk (where not all the study's pre-specified outcomes have been reported; one or more reported primary outcomes were not pre-specified; outcomes of interest are reported incompletely and so cannot be used; study fails to include results of a key outcome that would have been expected to have been reported);</P>
<P>- unclear risk.</P>
<P>6. Other sources of bias: Was the study apparently free of other problems that could put it at a high risk of bias? For each included study, we described any important concerns regarding other possible sources of bias. We assessed whether each study was free of other problems that could put it at risk of bias:</P>
<P>- low risk;</P>
<P>- high risk;</P>
<P>- unclear risk.</P>

<EFFECT_MEASURES MODIFIED="2011-06-05 18:37:20 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>To measure the effect of the different methods of suctioning the relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were to be calculated for bivariate outcomes. The weighted mean difference (WMD) and its 95% CI was to be calculated for continuous outcomes. In the case of crossover trials, data from both periods were to be used for analysis if possible. The fixed effect model was to be used in the meta-analysis if there was no heterogeneity among studies. Subgroup analyses were to be performed as proposed if data permitted.</P>

<P>To measure the effect of the different methods of suctioning the relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were to be calculated for bivariate outcomes. The weighted mean difference (WMD) and its 95% CI was to be calculated for continuous outcomes. However, as there was only one included study which reported continuous outcomes, only mean differences could be calculated.</P>
<P>In the case of crossover trials, data from both periods were to be used for analysis if possible. Data from the one included study were reported as means and SDs for the two groups prior to, during, and after suctioning. Because data were available for two suctioning periods these data were pooled. Individual or paired analysis data were not reported and because this was the only identified study it was not possible to impute a correlation coefficient. Therefore, data from this study is presented as parallel group data. Because of this, the standard deviation of each group is probably an underestimate and it is, therefore, less likely that any differences between groups would be significant. However, the authors of this study did report using a repeated measures analysis and did not find any significant difference between groups.</P>
<P>The fixed effect model was to be used in the meta-analysis if there was no heterogeneity among studies. As there was only one identified study a fixed effect model was, therefore, used.</P>

<P>The original review search strategy had resulted in 85 references. However, none of these were identified as potentially relevant. A further 149 references were identified in the updated search, of which two were potentially relevant. One small crossover trial of 27 neonates (<LINK REF="STD-Youngmee-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Youngmee 2003</LINK>) of shallow versus deep suctioning met the criteria for inclusion in this review. The reported outcomes were oxygen saturation and heart rate, during and after suctioning. The other identified paper was a duplicate publication of <LINK REF="STD-Youngmee-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Youngmee 2003</LINK>.</P>
<P>The reported outcomes were oxygen saturation and heart rate, at baseline, at two hyperoxygenation/hyperventilation intervals prior to suctioning and for one interval after the first and second suction, during the first and second suction and following the second suction. Each infant received shallow and deep suctioning during the two suctioning phases. The order in which they received deep and shallow suctioning was randomised.There were no significant differences when shallow and deep suctioning methods were compared.</P>
<P>Data was reported for all 27 infants for shallow and deep suctioning at each phase. Therefore, first interval data was not available. The data for the outcomes of oxygen saturation (%) and heart rate during suctioning and post protocol were collected for this review.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2011-06-15 20:22:10 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>As there only one small randomised controlled trial identified in this systematic review it is not possible to determine whether deep or shallow suctioning of the endotracheal tube is more effective or causes less harm for ventilated neonates and infants.</P>
<P>Research describing the potential negative effects of deep suctioning has been reported dating back to the 1960s (<LINK REF="REF-Thambiran-1966" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thambiran 1966</LINK>). Insertion of suction catheters to the end of the endotracheal tube has been recommended based on findings from electron microscopy in young rabbits where there was an increase in the area of tracheal necrosis and inflammation when deep suctioning was performed (<LINK REF="REF-Bailey-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bailey 1988</LINK>). A study comparing uncontrolled deep suctioning to controlled shallow suctioning in low birth weight infants suggested there was more severe tracheal pathology at autopsy in the infants who received deep suctioning (<LINK REF="REF-Brodsky-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brodsky 1987</LINK>). However, these findings were not statistically significant, and this study used historical controls with several confounding factors. In a series of case reports where granulation tissue in the bronchi of premature infants was identified, the authors postulated that these findings were a response to repeated mechanical trauma of endotracheal tube suctioning (<LINK REF="REF-Miller-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Miller 1981</LINK>). The recommendations resulting from all of these findings were for modifications to the suction procedure to avoid the catheter tip extending beyond the tip of the endotracheal tube (<LINK REF="REF-Bailey-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bailey 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Brodsky-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brodsky 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Miller-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Miller 1981</LINK>). Despite these recommendations from the 1980s the practice of deep suctioning continues in some NICU's (<LINK REF="REF-Tolles-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tolles 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Copnell-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Copnell 1995</LINK>). This may be a deliberate practice due to the belief that deep suctioning works better at removing secretions and helps maintain tube patency. However, we could not find any evidence from randomised trials to support or refute this practice. Given that there is some evidence from small observational studies of risk associated with deep suctioning (<LINK REF="REF-Bailey-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bailey 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Brodsky-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brodsky 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jaw-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jaw 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Boothroyd-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boothroyd 1996</LINK>) there appears to be no evidence at this stage to recommend deep suctioning. This is in line with the American Association for Respiratory Care Clinical Practice Guidelines 2010 (<LINK REF="REF-AARC-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">AARC 2010</LINK>) which suggests that shallow suctioning should be used based on the current evidence from infant and paediatric studies.</P>

<P>There is no evidence from randomised controlled trials to refute or support the practice of deep or shallow suctioning of endotracheal tubes in ventilated neonates and infants. However, given the evidence from uncontrolled and observational studies which have compared the techniques, there appears to be a realistic concern regarding the practice of deep suctioning.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2011-06-15 20:23:52 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is no evidence from randomised controlled trials concerning the benefits or risks of deep versus shallow suctioning of endotracheal tubes in ventilated neonates and infants. Further high quality research is required to conclusively establish whether there are any benefits to deep versus shallow suctioning. Given the review authors' concern that a randomised controlled trial comparing deep with shallow suctioning may be considered unethical based on the available anecdotal evidence that deep suctioning results in trauma to the trachea, we would suggest a randomised controlled trial may be possible in a neonatal intensive care unit where the standard suctioning practice includes a deep suctioning technique.</P>
