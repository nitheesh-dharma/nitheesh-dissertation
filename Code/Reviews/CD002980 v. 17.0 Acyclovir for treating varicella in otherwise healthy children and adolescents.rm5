<SUMMARY>
<TITLE>Acyclovir can reduce the number of days with fever in otherwise healthy children with chickenpox, but its effect on sores and itching is not yet certain</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Chickenpox (varicella) is caused by a virus. It begins with a fever, followed by a rash of red pimples which become itchy sores that form scabs. Chickenpox usually affects children from one to 14 years. In young babies, adults or people with impaired immune system, chickenpox is more severe. Treatments include lotions to relieve itchiness, paracetamol (acetaminophen) for fever and the antiviral drug acyclovir. The review of trials found that acyclovir reduces the number of days of fever from chickenpox in otherwise healthy children, usually without adverse effects. It is not clear whether it improves sores and itching.</P>

<P>Acyclovir has the potential to shorten the course of illness which may result in reduced costs and morbidity associated with chickenpox. </P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2008-10-31 09:25:24 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Liz Dooley">
<P>To examine the evidence evaluating the efficacy of acyclovir in alleviating symptoms of chickenpox and shortening the duration of illness.<BR/>To examine complications of chickenpox and adverse effects associated with acyclovir as reported in the relevant trials.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2008-10-31 09:25:58 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Liz Dooley">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (<I>The Cochrane Library, </I>2008, issue 3) which contains the Acute Respiratory Infections Group's Specialized Register, MEDLINE (1950 to Septemer Week 3, 2008), and EMBASE (1974 to September 2008). The reference lists of all relevant articles were reviewed.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomized controlled trials that evaluated otherwise healthy children zero to 18 years of age, with chickenpox.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2008-07-10 12:20:19 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two review authors independently reviewed the studies for eligibility. Two review authors independently assessed methodological quality of the relevant studies using the Jadad scale and allocation concealment. Differences were resolved by consensus. Data were extracted by one review author using a structured form and checked by a second.</P>
<P>Continuous data were converted to the weighted mean difference (WMD). Weighted mean differences were combined into an overall estimate using random effects. There were too few studies to consider exploring statistical heterogeneity between studies (i.e., differences in reported effects), formally, or to assess for publication bias.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Three studies were included. Study quality was three (n = 2) and four (n = 1) on the Jadad scale. Acyclovir was associated with a reduction in the number of days with fever (-1.1 days, 95% CI -1.3 to -0.9) and in reducing the maximum number of lesions (-76 lesions, -145 to -8). Results were less supportive with respect to the number of days to no new lesions and the number of days to the relief of itching. There were no clinically important differences between acyclovir and placebo with respect to complications associated with chickenpox or adverse effects associated with the treatment.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>Acyclovir appears to be effective in reducing the number of days with fever and the maximum number of lesions among otherwise healthy children with chickenpox. The results were less convincing with respect to the number of days to no new lesions and relief of itchiness. The clinical importance of acyclovir treatment in otherwise healthy children remains uncertain.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-08-14 12:03:33 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Liz Dooley">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2008-08-14 12:03:33 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Liz Dooley">
<P>Varicella, or chickenpox, is a common, highly contagious illness caused by the varicella-zoster virus (VZV) (<LINK REF="REF-Brunell-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brunell 1987</LINK>). It is primarily a disease of early childhood with 90% of cases occurring in children 1 to 14 years of age (<LINK REF="REF-Preblud-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Preblud 1984</LINK>). The disease spreads by direct person-to-person contact of open lesions or airborne droplets (<LINK REF="REF-Brunell-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brunell 1987</LINK>) and tends to increase in severity with each subsequent case within a household (<LINK REF="REF-Ross-1962" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ross 1962</LINK>). The period of transmission begins one to two days before any rash appears (<LINK REF="REF-Avery-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Avery 1994</LINK>) and continues for the first five to six days (<LINK REF="REF-Brunell-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brunell 1987</LINK>). The disease is more severe in neonates (<LINK REF="REF-Gershon-1975" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gershon 1975</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Meyers-1974" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meyers 1974</LINK>), adults (<LINK REF="REF-Preblud-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Preblud 1981</LINK>), and individuals who have impaired immune systems (<LINK REF="REF-Feldhoff-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Feldhoff 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Feldman-1975" TYPE="REFERENCE">Feldman 1975</LINK>). After one episode of varicella, individuals usually have lifelong immunity (<LINK REF="REF-Brunell-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brunell 1987</LINK>).</P>
<P>Chickenpox is generally self-limiting in young children and is manifested by fever, mild constitutional symptoms, and an itchy, vesicular rash. Symptoms usually appear 11 to 20 days after exposure to VZV (<LINK REF="REF-Preblud-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Preblud 1984</LINK>). The rash most often appears in three successive crops of lesions numbering on average 300 to 400 (<LINK REF="REF-CDC-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">CDC 2001</LINK>). The lesions progress from macules through to crusted lesions over a three-day period (<LINK REF="STD-Feder-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Feder 1990</LINK>). The rash is most commonly distributed over the trunk, scalp and face. Diagnosis can be made clinically by the rash characteristic of chickenpox (<LINK REF="REF-Preblud-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Preblud 1984</LINK>) and a history of contact (<LINK REF="REF-Brunell-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brunell 1987</LINK>).</P>
<P>Complications of chicken pox are varied and may occur in five to ten per cent of all patients. Complications among otherwise healthy children are rare (<LINK REF="REF-Conway-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Conway 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mouzard-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mouzard 1998</LINK>) but are more common among neonates, adults and immunocompromised individuals (<LINK REF="REF-Preblud-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Preblud 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rotbart-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rotbart 1993</LINK>). Data with respect to complication rates among specific subgroups are lacking. Complications primarily involve the skin, the central nervous system and the respiratory system (<LINK REF="REF-Drwal_x002d_Klein-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Drwal-Klein 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mouzard-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mouzard 1998</LINK>). The most frequent complication is bacterial infection secondary to cutaneous lesions (<LINK REF="REF-Mouzard-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mouzard 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Preblud-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Preblud 1984</LINK>). The most common neurological complications are cerebellar ataxia and encephalitis. Complications of the respiratory system include pneumonia and upper respiratory tract infections (particularly otitis media).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2008-07-10 12:37:01 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Traditional treatment for chickenpox is symptomatic, through the use of lotions to relieve itchiness (<LINK REF="REF-Brunell-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brunell 1987</LINK>) and acetaminophen to reduce fever and pain (<LINK REF="REF-Avery-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Avery 1994</LINK>). Newer treatments include immunoglobulins, vaccines, and anti-viral drugs for the prevention of chicken pox, as well as immunoglobulins and anti-viral drugs to moderate and shorten the course of the disease. As an anti-viral drug, acyclovir prevents the replication of the VZV (<LINK REF="REF-Arvin-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Arvin 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Laskin-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Laskin 1984</LINK>) and has the potential to eradicate VZV and relieve symptoms more rapidly. Since the drug is only absorbed by the cells that are infected with the virus, acyclovir has minimal adverse effects (<LINK REF="REF-Croze-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Croze 1994</LINK>). Some reported adverse effects to the oral administration of acyclovir include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and vertigo (<LINK REF="REF-Croze-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Croze 1994</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2008-07-10 12:36:47 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The economic burden associated with chickenpox results from costs associated with hospitalizations, physician visits, prescription and nonprescription medications, and lost income by caregivers who must remain at home during the course of the child's illness (<LINK REF="REF-Brunell-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brunell 1991</LINK>). It has been estimated that lost wages account for more than 95% of the total costs (<LINK REF="REF-Preblud-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Preblud 1986</LINK>). The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend that children remain at home for six days after the rash onset (<LINK REF="REF-CDC-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">CDC 2001</LINK>). These recommendations vary according to local public health authorities; others advocate return to normal activity earlier, particularly with milder forms of the disease (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 1991</LINK>). The Canadian Pediatric Society recommends that children return to school as soon as they feel well enough to resume normal activities, regardless of the state of the rash (<LINK REF="REF-CPS-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">CPS 1999</LINK>). Because of the potential costs associated with lost time from work by primary caregivers, an intervention that reduces the length of illness may be well received.</P>

Means were calculated from proportions of patients remaining with lesions (<LINK REF="STD-Balfour-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Balfour 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dunkle-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Dunkle 1991</LINK>), fever (<LINK REF="STD-Balfour-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Balfour 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dunkle-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Dunkle 1991</LINK>), and itching (<LINK REF="STD-Dunkle-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Dunkle 1991</LINK>). Day five (fever, pruritis) and day seven (new lesions) were used as the last possible day for the event to occur. These substitutions give less conservative estimates of variance. Inter-quartile ranges, that is, 25th to 75th percentile were converted into standard deviations and pooled for both treatment groups (<LINK REF="STD-Balfour-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Balfour 1990</LINK>). Imputing using upper bound p-values gave conservative variances in both treatment groups (<LINK REF="STD-Balfour-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Balfour 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dunkle-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Dunkle 1991</LINK>) for the maximum number lesions.</P>
<P>Risk ratios were used to combine dichotomous outcomes (such as skin complications). Results were combined into an overall estimate using random effects. Fixed-effect results were presented if statistical significance changed.</P>
<P>Since the adverse event data were not independent (the numbers were reported by event not by patient), risk differences could not be calculated nor any further analysis.</P>

<P>Thirteen studies were identified as being potentially relevant. Nine of the studies were excluded because they were not RCTs; one RCT was excluded because it evaluated immediate versus delayed anti-viral treatment therefore all patients received acyclovir (<LINK REF="STD-Balfour-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Balfour 2001</LINK>). Three studies were included in this review (<I>see </I>'Characteristics of included studies' table). There was 100% agreement between the review authors with respect to study relevance.</P>
<P>The three relevant trials were conducted in the United States and were published in English. All three studies were placebo-controlled and evaluated the efficacy of acyclovir among immunocompetent children in an outpatient setting. The mean age of the children in the three trials ranged from 5.2 to 14.8 years; the minimum age was two years and the maximum was 18 years. The studies varied in size with 105, 815, and 68 patients, respectively (<LINK REF="STD-Balfour-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Balfour 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Balfour-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Balfour 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dunkle-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Dunkle 1991</LINK>).</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Primary outcome (number of days to no new lesions)</HEADING>
<P>Two of three studies found a statistically significant advantage to taking acyclovir. However, overall the number of days to no new lesions was not significant (-0.8 days, 95% CI -1.6 to 0.02). The fixed-effect estimate was significant (-1.0 days, -1.2 to -0.8). Also, removing the study (<LINK REF="STD-Balfour-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Balfour 1990</LINK>) where we substituted the median for the mean gave an overall significant result (-1.2 days, -1.4 to -1.0) and heterogeneity was reduced from 91% to 0%.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Additional outcomes</HEADING>
<P>The results with respect to the maximum number of lesions were consistent in direction, however, only two of three studies reported a significant difference favoring treatment with acyclovir. The overall result was significant (-76 lesions, -145 to -8). Removing <LINK REF="STD-Balfour-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Balfour 1990</LINK> again reduced the heterogeneity from 84% to 0%. This sensitivity result was (-44 lesions, -72 to -16).</P>
<P>The number of days to no fever was reduced by treatment with acyclovir in all three trials: -1.1 days (-1.3 to -0.9). Heterogeneity was absent and the sensitivity result with <LINK REF="STD-Balfour-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Balfour 1990</LINK> removed was largely unmodified.</P>
<P>The number of days to relief of itching was reported in two studies. <LINK REF="STD-Dunkle-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Dunkle 1991</LINK> found a 0.8 day advantage with acyclovir treatment (95% CI -1.0 to -0.7). <LINK REF="STD-Balfour-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Balfour 1990</LINK> found no advantage (0 days; 95% CI -0.6 to 0.6).

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Sensitivity analysis</HEADING>
<P>The <LINK REF="STD-Balfour-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Balfour 1990</LINK> study results were imputed from non-parametric data and may have produced less precise results. If so, as shown above both outcomes that were insignificant became significant when <LINK REF="STD-Balfour-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Balfour 1990</LINK> was removed. Also, in the two outcomes that had results from all three studies, when <LINK REF="STD-Balfour-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Balfour 1990</LINK> was removed, heterogeneity was also removed. This may indicate a stronger advantage for taking acyclovir.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Adverse effects</HEADING>
<P>Reported adverse effects involving the gastrointestinal system included: anorexia (23 acyclovir; 30 placebo); diarrhea (25 acyclovir; 18 placebo); nausea/vomiting (11 acyclovir; 10 placebo); stomachache/abdominal pain (22 acyclovir; 14 placebo); flatulence (two acyclovir; four placebo).<BR/>Those involving the respiratory system included: runny nose (18 acyclovir; 23 placebo); cough (23 acyclovir; 29 placebo); ear pain/redness (five acyclovir; six placebo); sore throat (24 acyclovir; 33 placebo).<BR/>The following adverse effects involving the skin were noted: hives (one acyclovir; one placebo); rash other than varicella (three acyclovir; one placebo).<BR/>Other reported effects were: conjunctivitis (acyclovir eight; placebo 11); headache (acyclovir 21; placebo 22); malaise (acyclovir 25; placebo 28); irritability (acyclovir one); skin odor (acyclovir one); insomnia (acyclovir five; placebo five); nose bleed (acyclovir two; placebo one); dizziness (acyclovir three; placebo two); restlessness (acyclovir one; placebo one); arthralgia (placebo three); frequency (placebo one); night sweats (placebo one); hyperkinesia (acyclovir one; placebo one); pain (acyclovir one); spasmodic hand movements (acyclovir one; placebo one).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Complications</HEADING>
<P>Complications were grouped by those involving the skin, central nervous system, or respiratory system. Fifteen patients developed secondary bacterial skin infections (five acyclovir; 10 placebo).<BR/>Central nervous system complications included cerebellar ataxia (one placebo) and meningoencephalitis (one placebo).<BR/>Respiratory ailments included pneumonia (one acyclovir), otitis media (two acyclovir; four placebo), pharyngitis (two acyclovir; two placebo), and bronchitis (one acyclovir).<BR/>There were no significant differences between the treatment groups with respect to all the grouped complications arising from chickenpox. Skin complications gave the largest simply pooled difference at one per cent. The review is not sufficiently powered to detect this difference; however, the size of difference is not clinically important.

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2008-09-08 09:41:47 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Liz Dooley">
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Efficacy of acyclovir</HEADING>
<P>This systematic review of acyclovir for the treatment of chickenpox in otherwise healthy children supports a reduction in disease severity and a shorter course of disease. This is demonstrated by a one-day reduction in the number of days with fever and significantly fewer lesions. The results for <LINK REF="STD-Balfour-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Balfour 1990</LINK> were imputed from non-parametric data and may therefore be less precise. The evidence is strengthened when this study is removed: a significant one-day reduction in time to no new lesions and in relief of itching. In this situation the median may be an inappropriate substitution for the mean because time to event outcomes are often skewed. The quality of the included studies was relatively good as measured by the Jadad scale thus having a low risk of bias.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Complications and adverse effects</HEADING>
<P>There were no clinically important differences between acyclovir and placebo with respect to complications associated with chickenpox or adverse effects associated with the treatment.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Meta-analysis</HEADING>
<P>We identified only three studies relevant to this review. Because of the small number of studies and their different study populations, we did not feel that it was appropriate to explore heterogeneity formally. Publication bias was also not assessed because of the small number of trials.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Implications for practice</HEADING>
<P>Though these studies have demonstrated the efficacy of acyclovir, the clinical importance of acyclovir treatment in otherwise healthy children remains controversial. The debate in the literature features four common themes.</P>
<P>First, the treatment appears to confer, at best modest benefits for a disease that is self-limiting and has few complications in otherwise healthy children (<LINK REF="REF-Brunell-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brunell 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mouzard-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mouzard 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>Second, the efficacy of acyclovir has been demonstrated when treatment was initiated within 24 hours of rash onset. Various authors have criticized this as being impractical in that many patients may not detect disease onset and not obtain a prescription until well after this 24-hour window (<LINK REF="REF-Brunell-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brunell 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Drwal_x002d_Klein-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Drwal-Klein 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McKendrick-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">McKendrick 1995</LINK>). In a recent trial, Balfour et al showed that patients who initiated acyclovir within 24 hours of rash onset showed better clinical response to therapy compared to those who initiated treatment at 48 or 72 hours (<LINK REF="STD-Balfour-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Balfour 2001</LINK>). Further, patients who began therapy after 48 hours responded more favorably than those who started after 72 hours. Others have questioned the extent of compliance with the study protocols (i.e., four doses per day) (<LINK REF="REF-Balfour-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Balfour 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McKendrick-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">McKendrick 1995</LINK>). Alterations in compliance may dilute already moderate results (<LINK REF="REF-Brunell-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brunell 1991</LINK>).</P>
<P>Third, while no formal cost-benefit analysis has been conducted, various critics have suggested that treatment benefits do not justify the additional costs of the drug as well as the physician visits required to obtain a prescription (<LINK REF="REF-Balfour-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Balfour 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McKendrick-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">McKendrick 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mouzard-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mouzard 1998</LINK>). If treatment with acyclovir does not significantly alter the complication rate of varicella, then the rate of hospitalizations and their associated costs are unlikely to change (<LINK REF="REF-Ghirga-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ghirga 1992</LINK>). In addition, only one study specifically measured the impact of acyclovir treatment on school attendance (<LINK REF="STD-Balfour-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Balfour 1990</LINK>). This study found no difference in the number of days missed from school between the acyclovir and placebo groups. Treatment with acyclovir may not have a substantial impact on the number of days missed from school as public health authorities in some jurisdictions move towards more permissive policies regarding school attendance following VZV infection (<LINK REF="REF-CPS-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">CPS 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>Finally, concerns have been raised regarding the emergence of an acyclovir resistant strain of VZV (<LINK REF="REF-Balfour-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Balfour 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ghirga-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ghirga 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McKendrick-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">McKendrick 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mouzard-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mouzard 1998</LINK>). There is evidence to suggest that resistant strains of VZV do not occur (<LINK REF="STD-Balfour-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Balfour 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cole-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cole 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Englund-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Englund 1990</LINK>).</P>
<P>At present, there appear to be too many unanswered questions to advocate the widespread use of acyclovir in otherwise healthy children. The treatment of chickenpox with acyclovir may become immaterial as public health authorities worldwide move towards adopting the varicella vaccine to protect against VZV (<LINK REF="REF-CDC-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">CDC 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Drwal_x002d_Klein-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Drwal-Klein 1993</LINK>).</P>

</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<UL>
<LI>When initiated within 24 hours after rash onset, treatment with acyclovir shows a therapeutic benefit in reducing the length of time with fever and the number of maximum lesions in immunocompetent children; results are less convincing with respect to the number of days to no new lesions, the maximum number of lesions and relief of itchiness.</LI>
<LI>There were no clinically important differences in the number of complications and adverse effects among the acyclovir and placebo groups.</LI>
<LI>The magnitude of the results does not support the widespread use of acyclovir among young immunocompetent children in which chickenpox is self-limiting and results in few complications.</LI>
</UL>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<UL>
<LI>A comprehensive cost-benefit analysis is required.</LI>
<LI>There were few data available on the impact of acyclovir on the number of days missed from school or work. If one of the more important advantages of acyclovir is to allow individuals to return to their activities sooner, this needs to be specifically evaluated and documented.</LI>
<LI>There is no evidence regarding different doses of acyclovir treatment. Smaller doses may reduce costs and increase compliance.</LI>
<LI>Further research should focus on the identification and treatment of immunocompetent children who are at higher risk of more severe disease (for example, those with chronic respiratory conditions, children exposed through intrafamilial contact).</LI>
<LI>Other antivirals against varicella with improved bioavailability are now available (i.e., valaciclovir and famciclovir) and should be studied in pediatric populations.</LI>
