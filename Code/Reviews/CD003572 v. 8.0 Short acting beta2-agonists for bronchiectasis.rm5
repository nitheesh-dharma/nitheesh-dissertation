<SUMMARY>
<TITLE>No randomised trials were found testing short-acting beta-2 agonists in people with bronchiectasis.</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Bronchiectasis is characterised by the build up of mucus in the lungs which can result from other airways disease such as childhood pneumonia or tuberculosis. Medical treatment for bronchiectasis includes physiotherapy, antibiotics and occasionally mucolytics (drugs which are used to try and clear the mucus in the lungs). Since many people with bronchiectasis show signs of poor airflow, bronchodilator therapy such as reliever inhalers is frequently prescribed. Currently there are no randomised controlled trials that investigate the role of these bronchodilators in bronchiectasis. Since short acting beta-2 agonist therapy is the most frequently used treatment for airflow obstruction in this condition, there appears to be a very great need to investigate the effectiveness of such therapy in clinical trials. </P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Bronchiectasis is a condition characterized by an abnormal and irreversible dilatation of the sub segmental airways and it may be caused by a variety of disease processes. Currently medical treatment includes physiotherapy, antibiotics and occasionally mucolytics. Many people with bronchiectasis receive bronchodilator therapy, since many people with the condition show signs of airflow obstruction and bronchial hyper-responsiveness. Evidence on effectiveness of bronchodilator therapy in bronchiectasis has only recently started to be systematically studied.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>The present review examined the effectiveness of short acting beta-2 agonist therapy in bronchiectasis, as this is the most frequently used treatment for airflow obstruction in people with this condition. </P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2008-05-12 14:21:26 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register. We also checked bibliographies of all identified RCTs to identify potentially relevant citations. Searches are current as of May 2008.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>All randomised controlled trials were considered for inclusion, whether single or double blind. The control group was placebo/no treatment or other drug/physical therapy.

</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>We identified 48 articles by the search, the majority of which could be excluded on the basis of the abstract as they were not RCTs. Six articles were retrieved and were all excluded after careful consideration because they were either not RCTs or they did not deal with the question of interest. </P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>We failed to identify any RCTs investigating the role of short acting beta agonists in bronchiectasis. Since short acting beta-2 agonist therapy is the most frequently used treatment for airflow obstruction in bronchiectasis, there appears to be the need to investigate the effectiveness of this therapy using an RCT.</P>

</ABSTRACT>
<BODY MODIFIED="2008-05-12 14:28:36 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Bronchiectasis is a condition characterized by an abnormal and irreversible dilatation of the subsegmental airways. Bronchiectasis may be caused by a variety of disease processes, including congenital disorders, mechanical obstruction of the bronchi, respiratory infections, immunodeficiencies and idiopathic causes. Many of these conditions lead to impaired tracheobronchial clearance, resulting in recurrent lower respiratory tract infections and inflammation, scarring and bronchial damage. Although some patients may remain clinically stable for many years, the natural history of the condition is usually a slow, progressive deterioration of lung function over time, with the most severe group developing respiratory failure. Symptoms include chronic productive cough, wheeze, and dyspnoea. Infective exacerbations of bronchiectasis are associated with worsening of the symptoms and patients with severe disease may have ventilatory failure. Medical treatment includes physiotherapy, antibiotics and occasionally mucolytics. Since many patients show signs of airflow obstruction and bronchial hyperresponsiveness, many receive bronchodilator therapy.</P>
<P>The rationale behind this review is that evidence on effectiveness of bronchodilator therapy in bronchiectasis has only recently been systematically studied. In fact, two Cochrane reviews have been conducted on the effectiveness of long acting beta-2 agonists and anticholinergic therapy in the treatment of bronchiectasis (<LINK REF="REF-Lasserson-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lasserson 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sheikh-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sheikh 2001</LINK>) and neither found evidence in the form of randomised trials. The present review intends to examine the effectiveness of short acting beta-2 agonist (SABA) therapy in bronchiectasis as this is the most frequently used treatment for airflow obstruction in this condition. A number of studies (<LINK REF="REF-Murphy-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Murphy 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Abu-Hassan-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Abu Hassan 1999</LINK>) have reported significant bronchodilator responsiveness in bronchiectatic populations, but there remains a degree of uncertainty as to whether these patients have two separate conditions, i.e. bronchiectasis and asthma, or whether reversibility of airflow obstruction is a feature of the condition. </P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>Our aim is to determine whether short acting beta-2 agonists:<BR/>(1) are of symptomatic benefit in patients with bronchiectasis;<BR/>(2) improve lung function in patients with bronchiectasis;<BR/>(3) impact on the natural history of the condition.</P>

<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
<P>In the absence of any randomised trials, results from seven non-randomised studies are summarized below.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Harrison-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Harrison 1983</LINK>; Investigation of bronchial hyper reactivity in participants with bronchiectasis. Fourteen participants with bronchiectasis were studied in a non-randomised fashion, by looking at changes in lung function after nebulised salbutamol, saline placebo and cold air inhalation. Twelve normal participants also underwent cold-air challenge. The study was not a RCT and was therefore excluded.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Currie-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Currie 1997</LINK> current knowledge about the use of nebulisers in bronchiectasis was reviewed. This was not a RCT comparing treatments and was therefore excluded. </P>

<LINK REF="STD-De-Luca-1999" TYPE="STUDY">De Luca 1999</LINK>: Assessment of the possible role of high resolution computerized tomography (HRCT) in visualizing the effects on the bronchial tree of beta-2 adrenergic agonist. It was thus excluded because it was not investigating the effect of short-acting beta-2 agonists in bronchiectasis.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Hassan-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Hassan 1999</LINK>: 24 participants with confirmed bronchiectasis were studied. Each participant inhaled fenoterol 400 mcg by metered dose inhaler after a baseline lung function test and then a lung function test 30 minutes later. A second dose of fenoterol 5 mg was administered via nebulizer and a lung function test was repeated after 30 minutes. At least 24 hours later a second test was performed with ipratropium bromide 40 mcg by metered dose in haler (MDI) and 500 mcg by nebulizer. Results were expressed as improvement from baseline values of PEF, FEV1 and forced vital capacity (FVC). Eleven patients responded significantly to one or both bronchodilators, five patients responded to both, three to fenoterol alone and another three to ipratropium bromide alone. The authors concluded that this subset of patients responded significantly to bronchodilators and that patients with bronchiectasis should therefore undergo bronchodilator testing. The study was excluded from our systematic review because it was not a RCT.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Koh-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Koh 2000</LINK>: RCT conducted on 19 children with primary ciliary dyskinesia to determine whether regular treatment with beta-2 agonists induces changes in lung function and bronchial responsiveness in participants with primary ciliary dyskinesia. In fact, the authors state that there is growing evidence that regular beta-2 agonist use in participants with asthma is associated with decreased airway calibre and increased bronchial hyperresponsiveness. Sixteen out of the 19 children had bronchiectasis. Participants received inhaled salbutamol or identical placebo (2 x 100 mcg four times/daily) for periods of six weeks with a washout period of four weeks. Results showed that salbutamol did not cause either a decline in lung function or an increase in bronchial responsiveness in participants with primary ciliary dyskinesia. The study was excluded because its focus was not primarily in bronchiectasis, thus it was not directly relevant to our question.</P>

</INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>No RCT could be identified to answer the effect of short acting beta-2 agonist therapy in bronchiectasis. We identified 48 articles but the majority could be excluded on the basis of the abstract as they were not RCTs. We retrieved six articles but these were all excluded after careful consideration because they were not RCTs (<LINK REF="STD-Harrison-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Harrison 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hassan-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Hassan 1999</LINK>) or they did not deal with our question of interest (<LINK REF="STD-Simson-1966" TYPE="STUDY">Simson 1966</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Currie-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Currie 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-De-Luca-1999" TYPE="STUDY">De Luca 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Koh-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Koh 2000</LINK>). Thus no RCTs have been conducted so far to investigate the role of short acting beta-2 agonist (SABA) therapy in bronchiectasis. </P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>Currently there are no randomised trials assessing the effectiveness of short-acting beta-2 agonists in the treatment of bronchiectasis. Before recommendations can be made about their use in clinical practice, better evidence is required. </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Our results show that no RCTs exist that investigate the role of short acting beta-2 agonists in bronchiectasis. Since short acting beta-2 agonist therapy is the most frequently used treatment for airflow obstruction in bronchiectasis, there appears to be the need to investigate by means of RCTs the effectiveness of such therapy. Long-term studies assessing effectiveness and tolerability would also be appropriate. </P>
