<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2012-12-11 13:31:01 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Prostate cancer is one of the most prevalent forms of cancer in men worldwide. Screening for prostate cancer implies that diagnostic tests be performed in the absence of any symptoms or indications of disease. These tests include the digital rectal examination (DRE), the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) blood test and transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) guided biopsy. Screening aims to identify cancers at an early and treatable stage, therefore increasing the chances of successful treatment while also improving a patient's future quality of life. This review identified five relevant studies, comprised of 341,342 participants in total. Two of the studies were assessed to be of low risk of bias, whilst the remaining three had more substantive methodological weaknesses. Meta-analysis of all five included studies demonstrated no statistically significant reduction in prostate cancer-specific mortality (risk ratio (RR) 1.00, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.86 to 1.17). Meta-analysis of the two low risk of bias studies indicated no significant reduction in prostate cancer-specific mortality (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.30). Only one study included in this review (ERSPC) reported a significant 21% relative reduction (95% CI 31% to 8%) in prostate cancer-specific mortality in a pre-specified subgroup of men. These results were primarily driven by two countries within the ERSPC study that had very high prostate cancer mortality rates and unusually large reduction estimates. Among men aged 55 to 69 years in the ERSPC study, the study authors reported that 1055 men would need to be screened to prevent one additional death from prostate cancer during a median follow-up duration of 11 years. Harms included overdiagnosis and harms associated with overtreatment, including false-positive results for the PSA test, infection, bleeding, and pain associated with subsequent biopsy.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2012-12-11 17:26:55 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="James Tacklind">
<P>Any form of screening aims to reduce disease-specific and overall mortality, and to improve a person's future quality of life. Screening for prostate cancer has generated considerable debate within the medical and broader community, as demonstrated by the varying recommendations made by medical organizations and governed by national policies. To better inform individual patient decision-making and health policy decisions, we need to consider the entire body of data from randomised controlled trials (RCTs) on prostate cancer screening summarised in a systematic review. In 2006, our Cochrane review identified insufficient evidence to either support or refute the use of routine mass, selective, or opportunistic screening for prostate cancer. An update of the review in 2010 included three additional trials. Meta-analysis of the five studies included in the 2010 review concluded that screening did not significantly reduce prostate cancer-specific mortality. In the past two years, several updates to studies included in the 2010 review have been published thereby providing the rationale for this update of the 2010 systematic review.</P>

<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2012-11-16 00:54:49 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>All RCTs of screening versus no screening for prostate cancer were eligible for inclusion in this review.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2012-12-11 13:27:04 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="James Tacklind">
<P>The original search (2006) identified 99 potentially relevant articles that were selected for full-text review. From these citations, two RCTs were identified as meeting the inclusion criteria. The search for the 2010 version of the review identified a further 106 potentially relevant articles, from which three new RCTs were included in the review. A total of 31 articles were retrieved for full-text examination based on the updated search in 2012. Updated data on three studies were included in this review. Data from the trials were independently extracted by two authors.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-12-11 13:28:36 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="James Tacklind">
<P>Five RCTs with a total of 341,342 participants were included in this review. All involved prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing, with or without digital rectal examination (DRE), though the interval and threshold for further evaluation varied across trials. The age of participants ranged from 45 to 80 years and duration of follow-up from 7 to 20 years. Our meta-analysis of the five included studies indicated no statistically significant difference in prostate cancer-specific mortality between men randomised to the screening and control groups (risk ratio (RR) 1.00, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.86 to 1.17). The methodological quality of three of the studies was assessed as posing a high risk of bias. The European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer (ERSPC) and the US Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial were assessed as posing a low risk of bias, but provided contradicting results. The ERSPC study reported a significant reduction in prostate cancer-specific mortality (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.73 to 0.95), whilst the PLCO study concluded no significant benefit (RR 1.15, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.54). The ERSPC was the only study of the five included in this review that reported a significant reduction in prostate cancer-specific mortality, in a pre-specified subgroup of men aged 55 to 69 years of age. Sensitivity analysis for overall risk of bias indicated no significant difference in prostate cancer-specific mortality when referring to the meta analysis of only the ERSPC and PLCO trial data (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.30). Subgroup analyses indicated that prostate cancer-specific mortality was not affected by the age at which participants were screened. Meta-analysis of four studies investigating all-cause mortality did not determine any significant differences between men randomised to screening or control (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.03). A diagnosis of prostate cancer was significantly greater in men randomised to screening compared to those randomised to control (RR 1.30, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.65). Localised prostate cancer was more commonly diagnosed in men randomised to screening (RR 1.79, 95% CI 1.19 to 2.70), whilst the proportion of men diagnosed with advanced prostate cancer was significantly lower in the screening group compared to the men serving as controls (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.73 to 0.87). Screening resulted in a range of harms that can be considered minor to major in severity and duration. Common minor harms from screening include bleeding, bruising and short-term anxiety. Common major harms include overdiagnosis and overtreatment, including infection, blood loss requiring transfusion, pneumonia, erectile dysfunction, and incontinence. Harms of screening included false-positive results for the PSA test and overdiagnosis (up to 50% in the ERSPC study). Adverse events associated with transrectal ultrasound (TRUS)-guided biopsies included infection, bleeding and pain. No deaths were attributed to any biopsy procedure. None of the studies provided detailed assessment of the effect of screening on quality of life or provided a comprehensive assessment of resource utilization associated with screening (although preliminary analyses were reported).</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2012-12-11 13:29:42 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="James Tacklind">
<P>Prostate cancer screening did not significantly decrease prostate cancer-specific mortality in a combined meta-analysis of five RCTs. Only one study (ERSPC) reported a 21% significant reduction of prostate cancer-specific mortality in a pre-specified subgroup of men aged 55 to 69 years. Pooled data currently demonstrates no significant reduction in prostate cancer-specific and overall mortality. Harms associated with PSA-based screening and subsequent diagnostic evaluations are frequent, and moderate in severity. Overdiagnosis and overtreatment are common and are associated with treatment-related harms. Men should be informed of this and the demonstrated adverse effects when they are deciding whether or not to undertake screening for prostate cancer. Any reduction in prostate cancer-specific mortality may take up to 10 years to accrue; therefore, men who have a life expectancy less than 10 to 15 years should be informed that screening for prostate cancer is unlikely to be beneficial. No studies examined the independent role of screening by DRE.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2012-12-11 15:02:31 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Adenocarcinoma of the prostate is common, with it being the second most prevalent cancer in men worldwide and the sixth leading cause of death in men (<LINK REF="REF-Jemel-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jemel 2011</LINK>). Prostate cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in developed countries and the third leading cause of death in men in those countries (<LINK REF="REF-Jemel-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jemel 2011</LINK>). It is the sixth most commonly diagnosed cancer in developing countries (<LINK REF="REF-Jemel-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jemel 2011</LINK>). Advanced age is the primary risk factor, and it is more common in black men and those with a first degree relative who has had prostate cancer (<LINK REF="REF-Gr_x00f6_nberg-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grönberg 2003</LINK>). Prostate cancer is most commonly diagnosed in ageing men, with more than 75% of all prostate cancers diagnosed in men aged 65 years and over (<LINK REF="REF-Parkin-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parkin 2005</LINK>). Prostate cancer incidence is highest in Australia, North America, Northern and Western Europe, as well as the Caribbean (<LINK REF="REF-Jemel-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jemel 2011</LINK>). Conversely, incidence rates are lowest in South-Eastern and South-Central Asia, including China (<LINK REF="REF-Jemel-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jemel 2011</LINK>). This geographic variation may be attributed to racial, dietary, and environmental factors as well as differences in the intensity of cancer detection efforts.</P>
<P>Prostate cancer can cause haematuria or urinary obstruction due to local progression. Cancer that spreads outside the gland may result in lower extremity oedema from regional lymphatic obstruction or pain from bone metastasis. However, the vast majority of men with prostate cancer have no symptoms and their tumours are detected by routine testing. Bothersome lower urinary tract symptoms due to benign prostatic obstruction are common in elderly men and may result in increased concentrations of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) but are not associated with an increased prostate cancer incidence (<LINK REF="REF-Jones-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jones 2010</LINK>). For most men prostate cancer is slow growing and does not result in clinical signs or symptoms during their lifetime (<LINK REF="REF-Berry-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Berry 1984;</LINK> <LINK REF="REF-Holman-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Holman 1999</LINK>). However, in some men prostate cancer progresses and is a leading cause of cancer morbidity and mortality. Efforts to accurately determine prognosis have been problematic. However, high histologic grade, high PSA values, and larger tumour size are associated with worse disease-specific prognosis (<LINK REF="REF-Partin-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Partin 1993</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2012-12-11 14:02:55 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="James Tacklind">
<P>The PSA test and digital rectal examination (DRE) are used as primary screening tools in the early detection of prostate cancer. Transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) and TRUS-guided needle biopsies are performed to confirm diagnosis following PSA or DRE testing, or both. These screening techniques aim to reduce overall and disease-specific morbidity and mortality by identifying prostate cancer more frequently and earlier, and thus they hopefully lead to early treatment regimens that may be more effective when applied to cancer confined to the prostate gland.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2012-12-11 15:04:16 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="James Tacklind">
<P>Screening for any type of cancer aims to increase the chances of successful treatment through early detection of the disease. Screening may be performed by one of three methods, mass (that is large scale screening of an entire population); selective (that is screening high-risk populations); or opportunistic (for example incorporated as part of a medical consultation). Testing for, or diagnosing of, a disease differs from screening. Diagnostic testing attempts to identify the disease in the presence of symptoms, whilst screening is offered to symptom-free individuals. In the case of prostate cancer screening, the presence of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS), typically due to benign prostatic obstruction, are very common in the ageing male and are not considered to increase prostate cancer risk (<LINK REF="REF-Jones-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jones 2010</LINK>). Therefore, PSA testing or DRE in men with LUTS is also considered screening.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2012-12-11 16:22:52 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Prostate cancer is common and a leading cause of morbidity and mortality. Prostate cancer rarely produces reliable early warning clinical signs or symptoms while still confined to the prostate gland. Preventive strategies, such as oral 5-alpha reductase inhibitors, are not widely utilised or effective curative treatments, and do not work for disease that has spread beyond the prostate gland (<LINK REF="STD-Wilt-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Wilt 2008</LINK>). Therefore, effective early detection and treatment strategies in asymptomatic men could potentially provide a large benefit to many men. While the intention of screening for prostate cancer is to decrease mortality and increase quality of life, the true benefit of screening for prostate cancer remains uncertain. Use of the DRE as a screening tool is limited due to poor reliability, sensitivity, and the inability to palpate the entire prostate gland, especially for small tumours that have not reached the prostatic capsule (<LINK REF="REF-Gambert-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gambert 2001</LINK>). However, it has the potential advantage of limiting overdiagnosis by detecting tumours that have grown in size to be detected on physical examination and that may progress to cause clinical signs or symptoms if left untreated. The PSA test produces high false-negative and false-positive results, depending on the thresholds utilised to define abnormality, and may detect prostate cancers that are unlikely to cause future health problems even if left untreated (overdiagnosis) (<LINK REF="REF-Gambert-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gambert 2001</LINK>). Recent data from a nested case-control study, which assessed the validity standards of the PSA test, concluded that the PSA test does not attain the likelihood ratios (that is the likelihood of a given test result in a person with the disease compared to the likelihood that the same result would be apparent in a person without the disease) suitable for a screening test, regardless of what cut-off value for the PSA is assigned (<LINK REF="REF-Holmstr_x00f6_m-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Holmström 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>Additional causes for concern include the cost of follow-up tests, the potentially invasive nature of these tests, and the subsequent use of treatment regimens that may provide additional adverse events. Although a man's risk of prostate cancer diagnosis increases with age, many men will live with undiagnosed prostate cancer only to die from another disorder, as has been confirmed in unselected autopsies (<LINK REF="REF-Berry-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Berry 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Holman-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Holman 1999</LINK>). Screening for prostate cancer in this scenario results in overdiagnosis, thereby exposing a patient to unnecessary treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Draisma-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Draisma 2003</LINK>). Additionally, the long-term prognosis for most men (especially elderly men) with PSA-detected prostate cancer is excellent, even among those treated conservatively, and is superior to that for men diagnosed prior to PSA testing. This may be due in part to additional lead time, overdiagnosis related to PSA testing, grade migration, or advances in other medical care (<LINK REF="REF-Lu_x002d_Yao-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lu-Yao 2009</LINK>). It has been estimated that screening for prostate cancer includes a lead-time bias (that is advancing the time of diagnosis) between five to 13 years (<LINK REF="REF-Draisma-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Draisma 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>The uncertainty about the effectiveness of prostate cancer screening has been further highlighted by the conflicting recommendations made by various medical entities (<LINK REF="REF-ACS-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">ACS 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Burford-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burford 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-AUA-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">AUA 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-RACGP-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">RACGP 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-USPSTF-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">USPSTF 2012</LINK>). Screening for prostate cancer may reduce both morbidity and mortality, yet the best method of screening (if any) is unknown. Equally, screening may promote treatment procedures that are unwarranted or may adversely affect the health outcomes of the patient, resulting in no net benefit or even net harm. The cost-benefits associated with screening and potential follow-up tests and treatment may be justified; however, the economic implication of prostate cancer screening remains unknown. Additionally, only a single trial of treatment versus observation for early stage, screen-detected prostate cancer has been reported (<LINK REF="REF-Wilt-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wilt 2012</LINK>).</P>
<P>Evidence on the effectiveness of treatment for prostate cancer is conflicting. An evaluation of radical prostatectomy versus watchful waiting in early prostate cancer in the Scandinavian Prostate Cancer Group Study Number 4 (SPCG-4) identified that, after 15 years, radical prostatectomy reduced disease-specific mortality, overall mortality, and risk of metastasis (<LINK REF="REF-Bill_x002d_Axelson-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bill-Axelson 2011</LINK>). Reductions in overall and disease-specific mortality and metastatic disease were limited to men less than 65 years of age. Conversely, a similar trial evaluating radical prostatectomy versus observation in localised prostate cancer reported that radical prostatectomy did not significantly reduce all-cause or prostate cancer-specific mortality when compared to observation (<LINK REF="REF-Wilt-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wilt 2012</LINK>). Sakr and colleagues have estimated that close to half of men aged over 50 years have histological evidence of prostate cancer, with this figure rising to close to 80% of men aged up to 80 years (<LINK REF="REF-Sakr-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sakr 1996</LINK>). Despite this high prevalence, prostate cancer is not commonly diagnosed as the primary cause of mortality in these men (<LINK REF="REF-Parkin-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parkin 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sakr-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sakr 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>In addition, there have been a number of population-based studies to examine the potential impact of prostate cancer screening that are frequently cited in favour of prostate cancer screening (<LINK REF="REF-Bartsch-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bartsch 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jacobsen-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jacobsen 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kopec-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kopec 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-van-Leeuwen-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Leeuwen 2010</LINK>). Findings of these studies are not temporally or geographically consistent with a screening effect; for example, the decline in prostate cancer mortality seen in the United States that began shortly after the initiation of widespread PSA screening is likely to predate any plausible impact due to PSA testing given the long time to any potential benefit (that is 10 years). These studies are at high risk for confounding, most notably selection bias and lead and length-time bias, which can only be adequately controlled for in a randomised controlled trial. These factors emphasize the importance of a systematic review of randomised trials for guiding individual patient, provider, and health policy decision-making.</P>
<P>The first version of this Cochrane review (published in 2006) concluded that there was insufficient evidence to either support or refute the use of routine mass, selective, or opportunistic screening for prostate cancer. An update of the review in 2010 identified three additional trials, which were included in the review. Meta-analysis of the five studies included in the 2010 review concluded that screening did not significantly reduce prostate cancer-specific mortality. Since the last update, several studies have provided follow-up data. This 2012 version of the review incorporates the latest updates to the literature to examine the current evidence and evaluate the absolute benefits and harms associated with screening for prostate cancer. We have rated the quality of the evidence by outcome according to GRADE and include a summary of findings table.</P>

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2012-12-11 16:22:52 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="James Tacklind">
<P>In the original review, the risk of bias was assessed by reporting the trial's conduct against the following key criteria:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>randomisation;</LI>
<LI>allocation concealment, as coded according to the criteria described in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2005</LINK>);</LI>
<LI>blinding of participants (graded as yes, no, or unclear);</LI>
<LI>blinding of outcome assessors (graded as yes, no, or unclear);</LI>
<LI>completeness of the follow-up, i.e. description of any numbers of participants lost to follow-up (graded as yes, no, or unclear); and</LI>
<LI>whether or not an intention-to-screen analysis was performed (graded as yes, no, or unclear).</LI>
</UL>
<P>Trials were categorized as attributing a 'low', 'moderate', or 'high' risk of bias (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>In this updated review, assessment of risk of bias was made using the Cochrane Collaboration's tool for assessing risk of bias, as described in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions </I>(<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). Two authors (DI and MMN) independently assessed the susceptibility to bias of the selected trials. Risk of bias in this review was assessed by reporting the trial's conduct against the following key criteria:</P>
<UL>
<LI>sequence generation;</LI>
<LI>allocation concealment;</LI>
<LI>blinding of participants, personnel, and outcome assessors;</LI>
<LI>incomplete outcome data;</LI>
<LI>selective outcome reporting; and</LI>
<LI>other sources of bias (defined as inappropriate data analysis).</LI>
</UL>
<P>Each criterion was assessed by a question-based entry, with the judgement being 'yes' indicating 'low' risk of bias, 'no' indicating a 'high' risk of bias, and 'unclear' (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). Overall risk of bias was summarised with consideration to the relative importance of domains and empirical evidence of bias. Risk of bias for each study was summarised as: (i) 'low' risk of bias, when a low risk of bias was described for all key domains; (ii) 'unclear' risk of bias, when the bias was deemed to be unclear in one or more of the domains; and (iii) 'high' risk of bias, when one or more domains were judged to be of a high risk of bias (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). Included studies were abstracted independently by the two authors using an abstraction form detailing the above mentioned criteria. Any discrepancies were discussed between the authors.</P>
<P>Additionally, the GRADE framework was applied to rate the quality of evidence for each outcome, with results reported in a summary of findings table (<LINK REF="REF-Guyatt-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guyatt 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sch_x00fc_nemann-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schünemann 2011</LINK>). Evidence rated as 'high' quality means that further research is very unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect, while a 'moderate' quality rating means further research is likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and may change the estimate. Similarly, an evidence rating of 'low' quality means that further research is very likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and is likely to change the estimate. A 'very low' quality evidence rating means that we are very uncertain about the estimate.<BR/>

<EFFECT_MEASURES MODIFIED="2012-12-11 15:32:06 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="James Tacklind">
<P>Statistical analysis was performed according to the statistical guidelines referenced in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). For dichotomous outcomes, the measure of effect is expressed as a risk ratio (RR) and absolute risk (AR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI); and for continuous outcomes, the measure of effect is expressed as a weighted mean difference with 95% CI. In the event that continuous data were reported on different continuous scales, outcomes were standardised, where possible, to calculate the standardised mean difference. Where data were available, and if the trial did not report intention-to-screen analysis results, we performed intention-to-screen analyses using the groups to which the participants were originally randomised (that is screening versus control).</P>

<P>Five RCTs were included in the review, with significant differences in the methodological design between them. The <LINK REF="STD-Norrkoping" TYPE="STUDY">Norrkoping</LINK> study recruited men 50 to 69 years of age in Sweden and screened every three years. During the initial phase of the study, only the DRE was offered, however the screening regimen later evolved to include DRE and PSA. A PSA level greater than 4.0 ng/mL was deemed the cut-off for biopsy. Participants were followed up over a 20-year period. The <LINK REF="STD-Quebec" TYPE="STUDY">Quebec</LINK> study recruited men 45 to 80 years of age in Canada and provided annual screening with combination DRE and PSA. A PSA greater than 3.0 ng/mL was deemed the cut-off for biopsy. Participants were followed up over an 11-year period. The <LINK REF="STD-Stockholm" TYPE="STUDY">Stockholm</LINK> study recruited men aged 55 to 70 years in Sweden for a one-time screening using DRE, PSA, and TRUS. A PSA greater than 10.0 ng/mL was deemed the cut-off for biopsy, with repeat TRUS performed for PSA greater than 7.0 ng/mL. Participants were followed up over a 15-year period. The <LINK REF="STD-PLCO" TYPE="STUDY">PLCO</LINK> study recruited men aged 55 to 74 years in the United States for annual screening with DRE and PSA. A PSA greater than 4.0 ng/mL was deemed possibly indicative of prostate cancer and patients were advised to seek diagnostic evaluation. Participants were followed up over a 10- to 13-year period.

<P>A preliminary article on the <LINK REF="STD-ERSPC" TYPE="STUDY">ERSPC</LINK> study reported that a consensus workshop was formed to structure specific components of the study. It was decided that an age range of 55 to 70 years was determined as being the 'core' age group for participants, with the inclusion of higher or lower age groups, or both, being left to the discretion of the participating centres (<LINK REF="REF-Schr_x00f6_der-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schröder 2003</LINK>). Another preliminary paper also stated that the primary endpoint of the <LINK REF="STD-ERSPC" TYPE="STUDY">ERSPC</LINK> study will be the prostate cancer mortality rate in the total study arm compared with the control arm; with one analysis to be conducted for the 'core' age group (men aged 55 to 69 years at entry to the trial) and another for all ages at entry (<LINK REF="REF-de-Koning-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">de Koning 2003</LINK>). It was also described that the <LINK REF="STD-ERSPC" TYPE="STUDY">ERSPC</LINK> study had sufficient power to detect a significant difference in prostate cancer mortality between the total study arm compared with the control arm if the true reduction in mortality by screening was 25% or more, or if contamination was limited to 10% if the true effect is 20% or more (<LINK REF="REF-de-Koning-2002b" TYPE="REFERENCE">de Koning 2002b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schr_x00f6_der-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schröder 2003</LINK>). It has since been estimated that the contamination rate in the <LINK REF="STD-ERSPC" TYPE="STUDY">ERSPC</LINK> study was 30.7%, accounting for 27,431 out of 89,353 men in the control group having at least one PSA test (<LINK REF="STD-Roobol-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Roobol 2009</LINK>). Similarly, the <LINK REF="STD-PLCO" TYPE="STUDY">PLCO</LINK> study reported that 45% of participants entered the study with a history of PSA screening in the three years prior to randomisation, with subsequently 52% of men assigned to the control group undertaking some form of screening during the study period.</P>
<P>There were also changes to the screening protocol of the <LINK REF="STD-ERSPC" TYPE="STUDY">ERSPC</LINK> study, where both the DRE and TRUS ceased to be used as screening tests in 1997 (<LINK REF="REF-Schr_x00f6_der-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schröder 2003</LINK>). The PSA cut-off value was also reduced to 3.0 ng/mL during this time, however several centres continued to use a PSA value of 4.0 ng/mL as the cut-off, or applied ancillary tests if PSA test values were within a certain range (for example men in the Italian centre with a PSA value of 2.5 to 3.9 ng/mL underwent DRE and TRUS) (<LINK REF="STD-ERSPC" TYPE="STUDY">ERSPC</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schr_x00f6_der-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schröder 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>Data were not analysed according to the intention-to-screen principle in the <LINK REF="STD-Quebec" TYPE="STUDY">Quebec</LINK> study. From a total of 31,133 men randomised to the screening group, only 7348 (23.6%) were actually screened (that is all 31,133 men were invited to be screened but only 23.6% took up the invitation and actually were screened). Similarly, of the 15,353 men randomised to the control group, 1122 (7.3%) were screened for prostate cancer at the study site. The data were extracted and re-analysed for this review according to the intention-to-screen principle by the authors of this review.</P>

<P>In total, 26,492 positive PSA tests were recorded in the <LINK REF="STD-ERSPC" TYPE="STUDY">ERSPC</LINK> study, with a further 22,699 biopsies performed. No deaths were reported as a direct complication (from issues such as septicaemia or bleeding) from the biopsy procedure. Causes of death in the 14 men who were biopsied and subsequently died within 120 days included intercurrent death not as a result of biopsy (2), ischaemic heart disease (6), lung cancer (1), pancreatitis and myocarditis (1), subdural haematoma (1), basilar artery thrombosis (1), unknown (1), and a combination of issues (1) (<LINK REF="STD-ERSPC" TYPE="STUDY">ERSPC</LINK>). The most common complications assessed as 'minor' were haematospermia and haematuria for greater than three days, whilst the most common side effects assessed as 'major' complications were pain after biopsy and fever (<LINK REF="REF-Raaijmakers-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Raaijmakers 2002</LINK>). Based on these biopsies, 7938 (9.6%) of 82,816 men in the screening group were diagnosed with prostate cancer; with 2483 (31.3%) of 7938 biopsied men diagnosed with prostate cancer outside of the screening protocol. The false-positive rate for men who had an elevated PSA value (different PSA thresholds were used to define elevated but typically the threshold was defined as &gt; 3.0 ng/mL) was 17.8% for men screened at least once in the <LINK REF="STD-ERSPC" TYPE="STUDY">ERSPC</LINK> study, compared to a detection rate of 3.4% to 3.6% (<LINK REF="STD-ERSPC" TYPE="STUDY">ERSPC</LINK>).

<P>The <LINK REF="STD-PLCO" TYPE="STUDY">PLCO</LINK> study similarly reported on adverse events for screening and treatment, with a false-positive rate of 10.4% and 15.0% for screening with the PSA test and DRE, respectively (<LINK REF="STD-PLCO" TYPE="STUDY">PLCO</LINK>). Pain or bleeding was associated with a rate of 0.3 per 10,000 screenings with DRE. The PSA test had a complication rate of 26.2 per 10,000 screenings (primarily dizziness, bruising, and haematoma; with three episodes of fainting). Medical complications from the diagnostic procedures occurred in 68 of 10,000 evaluations after a positive result from screening. These complications were primarily infection, bleeding, clot formation, and urinary difficulties.</P>
<P>The ongoing <LINK REF="STD-CAP" TYPE="STUDY">CAP</LINK> study also reported a variety of harms associated with screening (<LINK REF="REF-Rosario-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rosario 2012</LINK>).

Authors from the <LINK REF="STD-ERSPC" TYPE="STUDY">ERSPC</LINK> have published quality of life effects based on two participating sites in the study, which were modelled on the presence and absence of annual screening over the lifetime of 1000 men aged between 55 and 69 years (<LINK REF="REF-Heijnsdijk-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heijnsdijk 2012</LINK>). The model predicted a total of 73 life-years gained, with a relative increase of 40% of prostate cancer diagnoses, and relative decrease of 28% of prostate cancer deaths; with harms including 247 additional negative biopsies and 41 additional men receiving treatment. The number of quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained was 56 (range -21 to 97). Results relating to quality of life from both studies are expected to be published upon completion of the analysis and will be included in future updates of this review. None of the included studies provided a comprehensive assessment of resource utilization associated with screening for prostate cancer. However, estimates on the cost-effectiveness of PSA screening from data extrapolated from the <LINK REF="STD-ERSPC" TYPE="STUDY">ERSPC</LINK> study have been published (<LINK REF="STD-Shteynshlyuger-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Shteynshlyuger 2011</LINK>). Estimates from an earlier <LINK REF="STD-ERSPC" TYPE="STUDY">ERSPC</LINK> publication reported that 1410 men would need to be screened (with the number of biopsies needed being 413 and subsequent number needed to treat of 48) to prevent one death from prostate cancer. Based on these figures, it has been estimated that it would cost between USD 262,758 and USD 347,549 per life-year saved (<LINK REF="STD-Shteynshlyuger-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Shteynshlyuger 2011</LINK>), which is not indicative of cost-effective care or high-value care even if overall mortality was reduced to the same magnitude as prostate cancer-specific mortality, an assumption that is unlikely.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-12-11 16:08:35 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="James Tacklind">
<P>A total of five studies were included in this review. The studies differed considerably in their design, screening methodologies, frequencies, thresholds, and analysis, thus limiting the value of strict reliance on pooled estimates. We therefore provide an overview of the individual studies and an overall assessment of their results and potential patterns of findings. Based on evidence from five RCTs, prostate cancer screening that included PSA testing increased the number of men diagnosed with prostate cancer but did not reduce prostate cancer-specific or overall mortality. Findings from a 'core' subgroup enrolled in the ERSPC study indicated a 21% relative reduction in prostate cancer-specific mortality among men aged 55 to 69 years. The absolute effect was 1 per 936 screened and was not observed in other studies of men this age nor in other men enrolled in the ERSPC study. The relative reduction in risk was observed in two of the seven trials that participated in the <LINK REF="STD-ERSPC" TYPE="STUDY">ERSPC</LINK> study, which had large effects that may have driven the findings. When performing a meta-analysis on the only two studies that were assessed to have 'low' risk of bias (<LINK REF="STD-ERSPC" TYPE="STUDY">ERSPC</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-PLCO" TYPE="STUDY">PLCO</LINK>), there was no significant difference in prostate cancer-specific mortality observed (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.35). Screening led to diagnostic procedure-related harms that were generally minor but included pain, infection, and bleeding.</P>
<P>The <LINK REF="STD-ERSPC" TYPE="STUDY">ERSPC</LINK> study consisted of seven sites that varied in the selection of participants with respect to age and length of follow-up. Differences were also apparent in the screening intervention. Sites differed in their use of the PSA test, DRE, and TRUS biopsies; either as standalone tests, or in combination. PSA cut-off values for biopsy also varied (ranging from 2.5 ng/mL to 4.0 ng/mL), along with the number of core biopsies. Screening interval differed between the sites, ranging from every two years, every four years, or between four to seven years. On average, each participant in the &#8216;core age group&#8217; had 2.27 screening tests. Previous publications of the <LINK REF="STD-ERSPC" TYPE="STUDY">ERSPC</LINK> study have reported a benefit for screening for a 'core' group of men. In updated publications, statistically significant results are not only in a 'core' group of men aged 55 to 69 years but are also present when all men that were randomised were evaluated for prostate cancer-specific mortality (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.73 to 0.95) (<LINK REF="STD-ERSPC" TYPE="STUDY">ERSPC</LINK>). It should be noted that the variations in the screening and follow-up methodologies employed across the eight participating sites (although results from the French site were not included in this analysis due to short duration of follow-up) may influence the results. During the 11-year median follow-up duration, it was estimated that a total of 1055 men would need to be invited to undergo screening, and 37 prostate cancers detected, in order to prevent one death from prostate cancer (<LINK REF="STD-ERSPC" TYPE="STUDY">ERSPC</LINK>). Quality of life effects were modelled on two participating sites in the study, which calculated that the number of QALYs gained was 56 (range -21 to 97). The authors concluded that any benefit of screening was diminished by the loss of QALYs due to post-diagnosis effects including overdiagnosis. The QALY data should be interpreted with caution as the modelling was based on annual screening, whilst the <LINK REF="STD-ERSPC" TYPE="STUDY">ERSPC</LINK> study sites used a variety of screening intervals (two years +).</P>
<P>The <LINK REF="STD-Norrkoping" TYPE="STUDY">Norrkoping</LINK> study did not provide a comparison of socio-demographic data between the screening and control groups. It also reported that information regarding the study was distributed through newspaper, radio, and television broadcasting. This raises the potential for contamination and self-selection bias, with participants in the control group choosing to be screened for prostate cancer. Furthermore, the quasi-random method of allocation, lack of allocation concealment, and potentially incomplete outcome data for men who migrated increase the risk of bias of the trial. This study failed to demonstrate a reduction in prostate cancer-specific mortality due to screening (RR 1.16, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.72).</P>
<P>The <LINK REF="STD-PLCO" TYPE="STUDY">PLCO</LINK> study was conducted at 10 sites across the USA. The methodological approach was uniform across all sites, with men aged 55 to 74 years recruited for the trial and the screening group offered annual DRE and PSA testing (with the cut-off being 4 ng/mL). Participants in the screening group were offered annual PSA testing for six years and annual DRE for four years. Totals of 85% and 86% of men randomised to the screening group complied with the screening protocol for PSA testing and DRE, respectively, whereas 52% of men assigned to the control group underwent screening. The <LINK REF="STD-PLCO" TYPE="STUDY">PLCO</LINK> study reports on 10- and 13-year follow-up of participants; however, for the purposes of this review, the 10-year data were abstracted since this captures follow-up of 92% of participants compared to 57% at 13 years. With the exception of the analyses regarding tumour stage, which incorporated data from the 13-year follow up, all other analyses including the <LINK REF="STD-PLCO" TYPE="STUDY">PLCO</LINK> study utilised the 10-year follow-up data. Findings from this study did not identify a significant reduction in prostate cancer-specific mortality (RR 1.15, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.54), with results at 10 years of follow-up indicating no statistically significant increase in prostate cancer-specific mortality among screened individuals. While the high crossover rate is of concern in the PLCO study, the detection of prostate cancer in the screening group was 12% higher relative to the control group and the RRs for prostate cancer-specific mortality remained greater than 1.0 (that is higher in the screened versus the control group) even at 10 years after randomisation. These facts argue against crossover being a major reason why the PLCO study did not find a reduction in prostate cancer-specific mortality due to screening.</P>
<P>The <LINK REF="STD-Quebec" TYPE="STUDY">Quebec</LINK> study was limited by the lack of adherence to screening from participants randomised to the screening group. Although 31,133 men were randomised to receive screening for prostate cancer, only 23.6% of participants in this group actually complied with the randomisation and were screened. Similarly, approximately 7% of men randomised to the control group were screened for prostate cancer. Therefore, crossover between groups was an issue in this pragmatic trial. Data analysis was compromised as mortality data were not analysed according to the intention-to-screen principle. The authors of the trial reported a reduction in prostate cancer-specific mortality by comparing mortality in men who were screened to that of men who were not screened, regardless of their initial randomisation. Conversely, our analysis of the data, according to the intention-to-screen principle, showed no significant difference in mortality between the two groups (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.33).</P>
<P>The <LINK REF="STD-Stockholm" TYPE="STUDY">Stockholm</LINK> study allocated 2374 men to be screened, whilst 24,772 served as controls (that is not invited for screening). Men assigned to be screened received a one-time combination of DRE, PSA test, and TRUS biopsy. A PSA greater than 10.0 ng/mL was deemed the cut-off for biopsy, with repeat TRUS performed for PSA greater than 7.0 ng/mL. This study did not identify a significant reduction in prostate cancer-specific mortality (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.45). Only three cancers were detected after repeat TRUS or after biopsies following increased PSA. Thus, this study is likely to have low applicability to current clinical practice.</P>
<P>Overall, reductions in prostate cancer-specific and overall mortality were not observed. Four of the five included studies in this review reported no significant benefit of screening for prostate cancer when all men that were randomised were analysed. Meta-analysis of eligible studies indicated no significant reduction in prostate cancer-specific mortality, regardless of whether men were screened from 45, 50, or 55 years of age. Both the whole randomised population and the subgroup of men aged 55 to 69 years that were enrolled in the <LINK REF="STD-ERSPC" TYPE="STUDY">ERSPC</LINK> were found to have a significant decrease in prostate cancer-specific mortality following screening. Furthermore, even if assuming an actual overall benefit based on only the findings reported from the <LINK REF="STD-ERSPC" TYPE="STUDY">ERSPC</LINK> (while ignoring the other RCT findings), the absolute magnitude of benefit is small, takes many years to accrue, and is accompanied by considerable overdetection. Any potential benefit of screening needs to be balanced with known harms associated with screening and with subsequent treatment. Several reports have quantified that the risks of screening and follow-up biopsy, while typically transient, are not infrequent and include pain, bleeding, and infection. For any benefit of screening to occur, treatment must be effective. While the SPCG-4 study demonstrated a reduction in prostate cancer-specific mortality and morbidity among men with prostate cancer detected primarily by methods other than PSA testing, the magnitude of benefit for mortality was about 5% and was confined to men aged &lt; 65 years (<LINK REF="REF-Bill_x002d_Axelson-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bill-Axelson 2008</LINK>). Furthermore, several studies have reported on treatment-related morbidity that includes urinary, bowel, and sexual dysfunction (<LINK REF="STD-Johansen-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Johansen 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wilt-2008a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wilt 2008a</LINK>).</P>
<P>A meta-analysis of eligible studies indicated that screening was associated with an increase in the number of men diagnosed with prostate cancer (RR 1.30, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.65). Similarly, the proportion of localised prostate cancer was significantly greater in the screening group, with the proportion of advanced prostate cancer significantly higher in the control group. Despite this difference, a significant decrease in mortality was not demonstrated. Significant heterogeneity was associated with meta-analysis of these outcomes, which may be attributed to the varying PSA test cut-off levels, contamination in the control groups, or follow-up biopsy procedures across the various included studies. There were very limited data on metastatic disease, quality of life, or cost-effectiveness; however, a single quality of life derived model based on the <LINK REF="STD-ERSPC" TYPE="STUDY">ERSPC</LINK> study suggests, at best, a small improvement in QALY that is not cost-effective.</P>

<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2012-12-11 16:12:01 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="James Tacklind">
<P>The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force published an updated recommendation statement on screening for prostate cancer in 2012 (<LINK REF="REF-USPSTF-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">USPSTF 2012</LINK>). The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommended against PSA-based screening (grade D recommendation). This clinical guideline based its recommendation largely on data from the <LINK REF="STD-PLCO" TYPE="STUDY">PLCO</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-ERSPC" TYPE="STUDY">ERSPC</LINK> studies as well as a comprehensive review of the evidence examining the potential benefits and harms of prostate cancer screening.</P>
<P>The European Association of Urology (EAU) 2012 Clinical Practice Guidelines have included information from the <LINK REF="STD-ERSPC" TYPE="STUDY">ERSPC</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-PLCO" TYPE="STUDY">PLCO</LINK>, and <LINK REF="STD-Quebec" TYPE="STUDY">Quebec</LINK> studies (<LINK REF="REF-EAU-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">EAU 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Heidenreich-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heidenreich 2011</LINK>). The EAU guidelines suggest that a baseline PSA determination at age 40 years might be beneficial for risk-stratification of patients, upon which further follow-up intervals can then be based. It states that a screening interval of eight years may be sufficient in men with a baseline PSA of 1 ng/mL or less. The statement concludes that PSA testing is not recommended in men older than 75 years.</P>
<P>The American Cancer Society practice guidelines, published in 2010, recommend that asymptomatic men who have at least a 10-year life expectancy should make an informed decision with their healthcare provider about screening for prostate cancer after they receive information about the uncertainties, risks, and potential benefits associated with prostate cancer screening. Men at average risk should receive this information beginning at age 50 years, whilst men in higher risk groups should receive this information before age 50 years (<LINK REF="REF-ACS-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">ACS 2010</LINK>). This guideline included updated data from the <LINK REF="STD-ERSPC" TYPE="STUDY">ERSPC</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-PLCO" TYPE="STUDY">PLCO</LINK> studies, but not the <LINK REF="STD-Stockholm" TYPE="STUDY">Stockholm</LINK> study.</P>

It states that there are significant gaps in knowledge about the PSA test, prostate cancer, and treatment options. The National Screening Committee does not recommend a prostate cancer screening programme in the UK.</P>
<P>The Japanese Guideline for Prostate Cancer Screening, published in 2009, did not recommend population-based screening for prostate cancer. It also recommended that individual patients requesting screening be given appropriate information about the benefits and limitations of screening to assist their choice. Their recommendations only included preliminary data from the <LINK REF="STD-ERSPC" TYPE="STUDY">ERSPC</LINK> study and did not include data from the <LINK REF="STD-Stockholm" TYPE="STUDY">Stockholm</LINK> or <LINK REF="STD-PLCO" TYPE="STUDY">PLCO</LINK> studies (<LINK REF="REF-Hamashima-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hamashima 2009</LINK>).

<P>The American Urological Association (AUA) published their Best Practice Statement in 2009 recommending that, given the uncertainty, patients need to be informed of the risks and benefits of testing for prostate cancer (<LINK REF="REF-AUA-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">AUA 2009</LINK>). The AUA also recommends PSA screening only for well-informed patients who wish to pursue early diagnosis. This guideline incorporated results from the <LINK REF="STD-ERSPC" TYPE="STUDY">ERSPC</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-PLCO" TYPE="STUDY">PLCO</LINK> studies but not the <LINK REF="STD-Stockholm" TYPE="STUDY">Stockholm</LINK> study.</P>

The RACGP does not recommend routine screening for prostate cancer with DRE, PSA test, or transabdominal ultrasound. Rather, the RACGP concludes that patients should make their own decisions about being tested for prostate cancer after being fully informed of the potential benefits, risks, and uncertainties of prostate cancer testing.</P>
<P>Several systematic reviews have been published. As previously mentioned, a 2010 review by Djulbegovic concluded that there was no evidence to support routine use of screening for prostate cancer (<LINK REF="REF-Djulbegovic-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Djulbegovic 2010</LINK>). A 2012 systematic review also reported that screening demonstrated no significant benefit on reducing prostate cancer-specific mortality (<LINK REF="REF-Lumen-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lumen 2012</LINK>).</P>

</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2012-12-12 08:02:56 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="James Tacklind">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2012-12-12 08:02:56 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="James Tacklind">
<P>A pooled meta-analysis of the five included studies in this review identified that screening does not significantly decrease prostate cancer-specific mortality and is associated with a high degree of overdiagnosis, treatment and screening-related harms. Given the variation in study design and quality across the five included studies, it could be argued that pooling studies is not appropriate. However, assessment of four of the five studies individually using intention-to-screen analysis also indicated no decrease in prostate cancer-specific mortality. The only exception was the <LINK REF="STD-ERSPC" TYPE="STUDY">ERSPC</LINK> study, which reported, in a pre-specified subgroup of men, that 1055 men needed to be invited to screening and 37 additional men subsequently diagnosed with prostate cancer needed to receive early intervention to prevent one additional prostate cancer death at a median follow-up duration of 11 years. The known harms associated with screening (false-positives with PSA testing, complications associated with TRUS-guided biopsies, overdiagnosis and treatment-related harms) suggest that any small mortality benefit of screening at 11 years would be challenged by the occurrence of these harms that occur early and may persist.</P>
<P>For men who express an interest in prostate cancer testing, including those with risk factors such as family history of prostate cancer and African ethnicity, clinicians should adopt a shared, informed approach to decision-making. Men should be informed of the lack of benefit to at least 10 years, and demonstrated adverse effects, when deciding whether or not to undertake screening for prostate cancer. Any benefits from prostate cancer screening may take up to 10 years to accrue (<LINK REF="REF-Bill_x002d_Axelson-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bill-Axelson 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bill_x002d_Axelson-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bill-Axelson 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bill_x002d_Axelson-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bill-Axelson 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Johansson-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johansson 2009</LINK>). Men who have an anticipated life expectancy less than 10 to 15 years (either due to age or co-morbid conditions) should be informed that testing for prostate cancer is unlikely to be beneficial given harms associated with testing.</P>
<P>It should be noted that the available evidence from randomised trials summarised in this review is largely based on men of European descent. In the United States, black men appear to have a higher incidence and higher risk of dying from prostate cancer that is approximately twice that of other men (<LINK REF="REF-Howlader-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Howlader 2012</LINK>); the reasons for this are unknown. Only 4% of men in the PLCO trial were non-Hispanic black men and, although no specific information is available, it can be assumed that few men in the ERSPC trial were non-white. Therefore, there is uncertainty about the benefits and harms of prostate cancer screening in black men and men with a family history of prostate cancer.</P>
<P>Several fundamental issues must be addressed when considering screening for prostate cancer. Screening for prostate cancer is primarily performed using the DRE and PSA test, yet the specificity and sensitivity of both of these modalities are not ideal (<LINK REF="REF-Holmstr_x00f6_m-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Holmström 2009</LINK>). The consequences of heightened anxiety, further examinations through biopsies, and the considerable side effects associated with various prostate cancer treatments must be appreciated. This predicament is further compounded by the inability to understand whether identified neoplasms are clinically significant. Some slow growing tumours may never threaten a man's life, as is represented by the discrepancy between the incidence and deaths attributed to prostate cancer (<LINK REF="REF-Parkin-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parkin 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>A number of principles have been proposed, including the burden of the disease and the effectiveness of diagnostic tests and treatments, to assess whether a screening program is successful (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1968" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1968</LINK>). Prostate cancer is accepted as an important health problem; however, uncertainty exists over the effectiveness of diagnostic tests and treatments available. Much debate exists about use of the PSA test and the implications of potential false-positive and false-negative results. Similarly, although various treatments for prostate cancer are available (for example watchful waiting, radical prostatectomy, hormone and radiotherapy), high quality evidence is still developing (<LINK REF="REF-Bill_x002d_Axelson-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bill-Axelson 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bill_x002d_Axelson-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bill-Axelson 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wilt-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wilt 2012</LINK>). In future years, findings from the current screening RCTs will shed further light on longer-term outcomes from screening for prostate cancer and will document quality of life outcomes. However, until such data is available greater emphasis will be placed on patient and doctor communication. Many medical organisations currently support the concept of patient-informed, shared decision-making, regardless of whether they support or reject screening for prostate cancer. In the absence of definitive evidence from RCTs, a shared approach to decision-making between doctors and patients should be encouraged for men who inquire about prostate cancer screening or who have previously undergone prostate cancer screening. Facilitating this process with the aid of appropriate patient education materials will promote informed patient choice (<LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Connor-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Connor 2009</LINK>) while minimizing workload burden among primary care providers and permitting primary care clinicians to focus on other preventive healthcare strategies of proven effectiveness for other health conditions.</P>
<P>Prior to obtaining a PSA test, men should be informed about the known harms that are frequent, both in the immediate- and long-term, versus the potential for a benefit that may occur many years in the future. Clinicians may adopt either a 'reactive' or 'proactive' method of counselling patients on prostate cancer screening, depending on their attitudes to screening; that is clinicians in favour of screening men of a certain age will adopt a 'proactive' nature to counselling as opposed to those that wait for the patient to raise the topic of screening. We believe that rather than counselling all men (proactive), counselling should be targeted to men who ask about screening, or those who have previously screened, in order to provide updated information. This approach permits clinicians to focus time, effort, and resources on areas of greatest concern to their patients and where there is greatest evidence of effectiveness. Mass screening, selective and opportunistic screening in the absence of patient knowledge and consent should not be performed.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2012-12-11 16:22:52 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Findings from this review support further research across a variety of health disciplines. Further long-term follow-up from existing trials is required to gain a better understanding of the adverse events, quality of life, and economic impact of screening. A longer follow-up period of existing trials with respect to prostate cancer-specific mortality will also provide more robust evidence that can better inform any net benefit of screening for prostate cancer. Future research could incorporate time-to-event analysis to account for the longer duration of follow-up from the included trials. Any additional trials should aim to provide high quality data on the impact of prostate cancer screening on quality of life, potential harms, adverse events, and an economic evaluation in addition to mortality across different populations (for example Asia). Additionally, such studies should be conducted using appropriate, or justified, selection of participants, adequate allocation concealment, adequate blinding of assessors, completeness of follow-up, and analysis of data according to intention-to-screen principles when possible. Prostate cancer-specific mortality is also highly dependent on the effectiveness of treatment regimens. Greater research is required from long-term, high quality trials to inform the effectiveness of current treatment regimens including radical prostatectomy, radiotherapies and active surveillance.</P>
<P>Evidence suggests that the PSA test does not have the required characteristics to be used as a widespread screening test for prostate cancer (<LINK REF="REF-Holmstr_x00f6_m-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Holmström 2009</LINK>). If the PSA test is to be used as a screening tool, greater evidence is needed to establish cut-off values for 'negative' and 'positive' test results to ensure that patients do not undergo unnecessary invasive investigations and, similarly, are able to be referred for further investigations when warranted. A systematic review of diagnostic test accuracy synthesising the current evidence would greatly inform the broader understanding of the PSA test, its characteristics and its value as a screening and diagnostic tool. Whilst the PSA test may be prostate-specific, it is not specific to prostate cancer. Therefore, continued research into alternative prostate-specific markers is required.</P>
<P>Additional research is also required to further identify the psychosocial aspect of screening, patient knowledge and uptake (or tendency for uptake) of screening, as well as clinician perspectives and needs on prostate cancer screening. Such research should include evidence-based strategies for communicating the evidence on the merits of prostate cancer screening to patients and clinicians given the current barriers to uptake of patient and clinician education on this issue.</P>

<P>The ERSPC program was a randomised, multi-centre trial across 9 European countries (The Netherlands, Belgium, Sweden, Finland, Italy, Spain, Switzerland, Portugal, and France). Each country used different recruitment and randomisation procedures. Participants were randomised 1:1 in all sites apart from Finland, which undertook a 2:3 randomisation process. Length of follow-up was dependent on site of randomisation. The trial reports data on 8 countries (data from Portugal was not included in this follow-up period).</P>

<P>The core age group for male participants was 55 to 69 years. In Sweden, study investigators included men between the ages of 50 and 54 years, and investigators in the Netherlands, Italy, Belgium, and Spain included men up to the age of 74 years at entry. In Switzerland, men between the ages of 55 and 69 years were included, with screening up to the age of 75 years. In Finland, men were recruited at the ages of 55, 59, 63, and 67 years. Men with a diagnosis of prostate cancer were ineligible for the study.</P>

<P>Participants in the screening group were offered a combination of PSA testing, DRE and TRUS biopsy. Most sites used a PSA value of 3.0 ng/mL as the cut-off and indication for biopsy. In Finland, a PSA value of 4.0 ng/mL was used for cut-off - men with a value between 3.0 to 3.9 ng/mL underwent a DRE until 1998. In Italy, a PSA value of 4.0 ng/mL was the defined cut-off, but men with a PSA between 2.5 to 3.9 ng/mL underwent a DRE and TRUS. In the Belgian and Dutch sites, a combination of DRE, TRUS and PSA (with a cut-off of 4.0 ng/mL) was used until 1997 - from which PSA testing alone was used. In Belgium, the PSA cut-off value was 10.0 ng/mL initially. The screening interval at 6 of the 7 sites was 4 years - Sweden used a 2 year interval. There was a 7-year interval between 1st and 2nd screening rounds in Belgium.</P>

<P>Crossover and contamination were issues for this pragmatic trial. The compliance and contamination rate within both the screening and control groups was described. From a total of 31,133 men randomised to the screening group, 7348 (23.6%) were actually screened (i.e. all 31,133 men were invited to be screened, but only 23.6% took up the invitation and actually were screened). Similarly, of the 15,353 randomised to the control group, 1122 (7.3%) were screened for prostate cancer at the study site. There was no report of any other withdrawals or whether participants in the control group were screened somewhere other than the study site; hence it is possible that more than 7.3% of the control group were actually screened. The data were re-analysed by the authors of this review according to the intention-to-screen principle.</P>
