<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2016-08-30 12:13:50 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>
<B>Review question:</B>
</P>
<P>For both term and preterm infants we wanted to identify the best method for offering supplemental feeds and asked if cup feeding is a better way to supplementally feed rather than bottle feeding or feeding with a tube, when newborn infants are unable to fully breastfeed.<B>
<BR/>
</B>
</P>
<P>
<B>Background:</B>
</P>
<P>Most infants born at term or slightly preterm can fully breastfeed following birth. However for a number of reasons some term newborns and many preterm newborns may not be able to fully breastfeed and require supplemental feeding by alternative methods, such as a cup, syringe, bottle or feeding tube, until they are able to fully breastfeed.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics:</B>
</P>
<P>Our search for eligible studies conducted on 31 January 2016 revealed five studies, all comparing cup and bottle feeding in newborn infants, which we were able to include in this review. These studies were conducted in neonatal and maternity units in hospitals in Australia, the United Kingdom, Brazil and Turkey. The mean gestational age of the infants in most of the studies were similar at the time of entry into the study. In four of the studies the intervention (cup or bottle) commenced from the time of enrolment into the study, when the infants first needed a supplemental feed and were as young as 30 weeks' gestation. In the study conducted in Turkey, supplemental feeding was not commenced on enrolment into the study and at the time of first supplemental feed but delayed until infants were at least 35 weeks of age.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results:</B>
</P>
<P>For some of the outcomes, the results of the different studies could not be combined. This included not breastfeeding at hospital discharge; not exclusively breastfeeding at three months and at six months; the average time taken for a feed; and the number of days spent in hospital. For each of these outcomes, the results from some studies favoured cup feeding, while the results from other studies favoured bottle feeding.</P>
<P>For some of the outcomes, the results of the different studies could be combined: there was no difference in weight gain or gestational age at discharge between those infants who recieved supplemental feeds by cup compared to bottle. However those infants who received supplemental feeds by cup were more likely to be exclusively breastfeeding at hospital discharge and were more likely to be receiving some breastfeeds at three and six months of age.</P>
<P>As the studies mostly included preterm infants and few term infants, no recommendations can be made for cup feeding term infants.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of evidence:</B>
</P>
<P>The quality of evidence for weight gain, length of stay, not breastfeeding at hospital discharge and at six months of age and exclusively breastfeeding at hospital discharge and at six months of age is graded very low to low. In the studies included in this review, it is reported that many infants who were to receive supplemental feeds by cup received supplemental feeds by other means as either the parents or nurses did not like cup feeding.<BR/>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2016-08-16 18:22:05 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Breast milk provides optimal nutrition for term and preterm infants, and the ideal way for infants to receive breast milk is through suckling at the breast. Unfortunately, this may not always be possible for medical or physiological reasons such as being born sick or preterm and as a result requiring supplemental feeding. Currently, there are various ways in which infants can receive supplemental feeds. Traditionally in neonatal and maternity units, bottles and nasogastric tubes have been used; however, cup feeding is becoming increasingly popular as a means of offering supplemental feeds in an attempt to improve breastfeeding rates. There is no consistency to guide the choice of method for supplemental feeding.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2016-08-16 06:41:23 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>To determine the effects of cup feeding versus other forms of supplemental enteral feeding on weight gain and achievement of successful breastfeeding in term and preterm infants who are unable to fully breastfeed.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2016-08-16 06:54:45 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We used the standard search strategy of the Cochrane Neonatal Review group to search the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2016, Issue 1), MEDLINE via PubMed (1966 to 31 January 2016), Embase (1980 to 31 January 2016), and CINAHL (1982 to 31 January 2016). We also searched clinical trials' databases, conference proceedings, and the reference lists of retrieved articles for randomised controlled trials and quasi-randomised trials.</P>

<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2016-08-16 07:02:03 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Data collection and analysis was performed in accordance with the methods of Cochrane Neonatal. We used the GRADE approach to assess the quality of evidence.</P>
<P>The review authors independently conducted quality assessments and data extraction for included trials. Outcomes reported from these studies were: weight gain; proportion not breastfeeding at hospital discharge; proportion not feeding at three months of age; proportion not feeding at six months of age; proportion not fully feeding at hospital discharge; proportion not fully breastfeeding at three months of age; proportion not fully breastfeeding at six months of age; average time per feed (minutes); length of stay; and physiological events of instability such as bradycardia, apnoea, and low oxygen saturation. For continuous variables such as weight gain, mean differences and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were reported. For categorical outcomes such as mortality, the relative risks (RR) and 95% CIs were reported.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-08-16 07:28:24 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The experimental intervention was cup feeding and the control intervention was bottle feeding in all five studies included in this review. One study reported weight gain as g/kg/day and there was no statistically significant difference between the two groups (MD &#8722;0.60, 95% CI &#8722;3.21 to 2.01); while a second study reported weight gain in the first seven days as grams/day and also showed no statistically significant difference between the two groups (MD &#8722;0.10, 95% CI &#8722;0.36 to 0.16). There was substantial variation in results for the majority of breastfeeding outcomes, except for not breastfeeding at three months (three studies) (typical RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.71 to 0.97) which favoured cup feeding. Where there was moderate heterogeneity meta-analysis was performed: not breastfeeding at six months (two studies) (typical RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.95); not fully breastfeeding at hospital discharge (four studies) (typical RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.52 to 0.71).</P>
<P>Two studies reported average time to feed which showed no difference between the two groups. Two studies assessed length of hospital stay and there was considerable variation in results and in the direction of effect. Only one study has reported gestational age at discharge, which showed no difference between the two groups (MD &#8722;0.10, 95% CI &#8722;0.54 to 0.34).</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2016-08-16 07:52:59 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>As the majority of infants in the included studies are preterm infants, no recommendations can be made for cup feeding term infants due to the lack of evidence in this population.</P>
<P>From the studies of preterm infants, cup feeding may have some benefits for late preterm infants and on breastfeeding rates up to six months of age. Self-reported breastfeeding status and compliance to supplemental interventions may over-report exclusivity and compliance, as societal expectations of breastfeeding and not wishing to disappoint healthcare professionals may influence responses at interview and on questionnaires.</P>
<P>The results for length of stay are mixed, with the study involving lower gestational age preterm infants finding that those fed by cup spent approximately 10 days longer in hospital, whereas the study involving preterm infants at a higher gestational age, who did not commence cup feeding until 35 weeks' gestation, did not have a longer length of stay, with both groups staying on average 26 days. This finding may have been influenced by gestational age at birth and gestational age at commencement of cup feeding, and their mothers' visits; (a large number of mothers of these late preterm infants lived regionally from the hospital and could visit at least twice per week).</P>
<P>Compliance to the intervention of cup feeding remains a challenge. The two largest studies have both reported non-compliance, with one study analysing data by intention to treat and the other excluding those infants from the analysis. This may have influenced the findings of the trial. Non-compliance issues need consideration before further large randomised controlled trials are undertaken as this influences power of the study and therefore the statistical results. In addition larger studies with better-quality (especially blinded) outcome assessment with 100% follow-up are needed.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2016-08-16 08:17:39 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The optimal milk for term and preterm newborn infants is their mother's breast milk; and the ideal way for them to receive breast milk is by sucking on the breast. However, due to a variety of reasons including being born preterm or sick, newborns may not be able to fully breastfeed initially. For these newborns an alternative method for supplemental enteral feeding will be required which may include gastric tube feeding, bottle feeding or cup feeding.</P>
<P>Traditionally, bottles and gastric tubes have been used routinely in neonatal and maternity units to feed newborn infants who are unable to fully breastfeed, particularly at night and when mothers are unable to be present for all feeds (<LINK REF="REF-Lang-1994b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lang 1994b</LINK>). While this may not be desired by either staff or mothers, and gastric tube feeding does not satisfy the infant's psychological and social needs (<LINK REF="REF-Lang-1994b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lang 1994b</LINK>), there are limited options for when the mother is not available to breastfeed. Cup feeding has been suggested as an alternative.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2016-08-16 08:20:37 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Originally, cup feeding was used to feed term infants who were born with oral deformities such as a cleft lip or cleft palate (<LINK REF="STD-Fredeen-1948" TYPE="STUDY">Fredeen 1948</LINK>). Instruments to supplementally feed newborns have existed throughout history and include pap bowls (a bowl with a wide brimmed lip); feeding horns (a bowl with a funnel-like horn); cups with lips; and bottles (<LINK REF="REF-Foote-1944" TYPE="REFERENCE">Foote 1944</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lang-1994a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lang 1994a</LINK>). Cup feeding is successfully used in developing countries where the care and hygiene facilities for bottles and nipples are limited and gastric tubes are not readily available (<LINK REF="STD-Dowling-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Dowling 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lang-1994b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lang 1994b</LINK>). Cup feeding is gaining increased use as an alternative feeding method in neonatal and maternity units for preterm and term infants who are unable to fully breastfeed (<LINK REF="REF-NANN-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">NANN 2004</LINK>). It is argued that because cup feeding only requires the infant to 'lap' the milk and then coordinate swallowing and breathing, infants can be fed using a cup from as early as 30 weeks' gestation. In preterm infants, this is generally before the time that breast and bottle feeding can be introduced as this requires the coordination of sucking, swallowing and breathing, which are often uncoordinated until approximately 32 to 35 weeks of age (<LINK REF="REF-Lang-1994a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lang 1994a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lang-1994b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lang 1994b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Palmer-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Palmer 1993</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2016-08-16 08:28:41 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The theoretical benefits of cup feeding include avoiding the confusion between breast and bottle (<LINK REF="STD-Dowling-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Dowling 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gupta-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Gupta 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Thorley-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thorley 1997</LINK>); enhancing the infants ability to develop a suckling action for breastfeeding (<LINK REF="REF-Thorley-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thorley 2004</LINK>); and facilitating the infants ability to self-regulate feeds and demand feed (<LINK REF="REF-Vallenas-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vallenas 1998</LINK>). The Baby Friendly Hospital Initiative (BFHI) training literature and guideline recommend the use of cup feeding for infants intended for breastfeeding, so that no artificial nipples are introduced to infants (<LINK REF="REF-Lang-1994b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lang 1994b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vallenas-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vallenas 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>The literature suggests that there are many benefits to cup feeding (<LINK REF="REF-Cousins-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cousins 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fredeen-1948" TYPE="STUDY">Fredeen 1948</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gupta-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Gupta 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kuehl-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kuehl 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lang-1994a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lang 1994a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lang-1994b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lang 1994b</LINK>): cup feeding is a simple procedure that can involve both parents; early positive body and eye contact is fostered; the infant receives positive tactile and olfactory stimulation; cardiorespiratory and oxygen saturation can be maintained (<LINK REF="STD-Dowling-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Dowling 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lang-1994a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lang 1994a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lang-1994b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lang 1994b</LINK>); the infant controls the feed and can pace the intake and the total volume of milk taken; and there is minimal risk of aspiration and minimal energy expended (<LINK REF="REF-Lang-1994a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lang 1994a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lang-1994b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lang 1994b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Thorley-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thorley 2004</LINK>). However, many of these benefits could also be claimed of supplemental enteral feeding including bottle and tube.</P>

<P>While there may be many benefits of feeding preterm and term newborn infants with a cup, there are also potential risks that need to be considered when introducing this practice into neonatal and maternity units (<LINK REF="REF-NANN-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">NANN 2004</LINK>). Some authors have reported that cup feeding is awkward and that the infant is at risk of aspiration pneumonia when the improper technique is used resulting in the milk being 'poured into' the infants mouth rather than allowing the infant to 'lap' or sip the milk (<LINK REF="REF-Lang-1994b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lang 1994b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Thorley-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thorley 2004</LINK>). Other potential risks include physiological instability (bradycardia, apnoea, low oxygen saturation) (<LINK REF="STD-Freer-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Freer 1999</LINK>), and choking and poor weight gain (<LINK REF="REF-Kuehl-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kuehl 1997</LINK>), which can result in extended hospitalizations and additional cost of care. Lastly, undesirable outcomes have been reported: nursing workload may be increased as a result of extra nursing time needed to cup feed, and term infants may refuse the breast, becoming addicted to the cup if use is prolonged and they are not given the opportunity to breastfeed (<LINK REF="REF-Lang-1994b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lang 1994b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Thorley-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thorley 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Thorley-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thorley 2004</LINK>). If infants require treatment as a result of an adverse event or if term infants reject the breast, this may result in increased stress and anxiety for the parents and family.</P>
<P>Before the introduction of cup feeding into neonatal and maternity units, this practice must be evaluated for efficacy and safety in terms of clinical outcomes, human resource use, cost and time.</P>

<P>Two authors independently assessed the quality of the evidence for each of the outcomes above. We considered evidence from randomised controlled trials as high quality but downgraded the evidence one level for serious (or two levels for very serious) limitations based upon the following: design (risk of bias), consistency across studies, directness of the evidence, precision of estimates, and presence of publication bias.

<P>Studies enrolled preterm infants with mean gestational ages at birth from 29 to 35 weeks, and all studies compared cup versus bottle feeds as a supplement to breastfeeding when transitioning from full nasogastric feeds to full breastfeeds.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Collins-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Collins 2004</LINK> included 319 preterm infants (mean gestational ages 29.3 and 30.0, mean birth weights 1334 g and 1446 g for the respective study groups 'cup' and 'bottle') of mothers who had indicated that they intended to breastfeed. Infants born at less than 34 weeks' gestational age were eligible for inclusion in the study and were randomised to supplemental feeds either via a cup or via a bottle. This study also randomised infants to either dummy (pacifier) or no dummy within each of the two study groups. The initiation of the allocated supplemental feeds was determined by the attending nurse/midwife or neonatologist and occurred when the mother was unavailable to breastfeed or when additional oral feeds of milk were required after a breastfeed.</P>
<P>The authors report that compliance to the allocated intervention, in particular to cup feeding, was poor and therefore reduced the power to identify a real treatment effect. The tertiary hospital that had previously been using cup feeding was more compliant with the intervention than the other tertiary recruiting hospital (where cup feeding was introduced for the study) or the participating 54 peripheral hospitals (where the use of cup feeding was uncommon).</P>
<P>The main outcome measures were partial or fully breastfeeding or no breastfeeding on discharge home. Secondary outcomes included length of hospital stay and prevalence of breastfeeding at three and six months post discharge.</P>
<P>Participants in <LINK REF="STD-Gilks-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Gilks 2004</LINK> were 54 preterm infants (median gestational ages 31 weeks and 32 weeks, median birth weights 1560 g and 1750 g for the respective study groups 'cup' and 'bottle') of mothers who had indicated an intention to breastfeed. However 14 infants (11 in cup feeding group and 3 in bottle group) withdrew prior to discharge and data is not presented for these infants. For infants to be eligible for the study, they needed to be born at less than 35 weeks' completed gestation and more than 30 weeks' gestation. Once enrolled into the study, the infant was randomised to receive supplemental feeds either by cup or bottle in addition to nasogastric tube feeds and breastfeeds. It is unclear who determined when supplemental feeds by cup or bottle were begun, the criteria for assessing which feed would be given by cup or bottle, and how often the infants received the allocated treatments as opposed to receiving feeds by nasogastric tube or the breast. Cup feeding had been introduced into the hospital six months prior to the initiation of the study, and staff had received information sheets and attended a teaching programme during the introduction phase.</P>
<P>The main outcome measure was partial or exclusively breastfeeding rates at discharge. Secondary outcomes included breastfeeding rates at term, at six weeks post term and postconceptional age at which the nasogastric tube was withdrawn.<BR/>
<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Mosley-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Mosley 2001</LINK> was a pilot study to establish the feasibility of conducting a randomised controlled trial of supplemental feeding methods. Recruitment of infants took place over a three-month period, resulting in the recruitment of 16 preterm infants, only 14 infants of which had data presented. The study compared two methods of supplementary feeding (bottle versus cup) for preterm infants of mothers who indicated a desire to breastfeed. The initiation of oral feeding or supplemental feeding was at the discretion of the physician or advanced neonatal nurse practitioner, which was the normal practice in the study hospital.</P>
<P>The main outcome measure was breastfeeding rates at discharge. Other outcomes were examined retrospectively, following assessment of the data set. These included the use of a pacifier (dummy), influence of assisted delivery on breastfeeding, previous experience of breastfeeding, influence of prematurity on breastfeeding rates, influence of support to breastfeed and the impact of delayed breastfeeding initiation.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Rocha-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Rocha 2002</LINK> was a stratified randomised controlled trial; 83 infants were randomised to either cup or bottle, however data for only 78 infants is reported. Infants were between 32 and 36 weeks' gestation and weighing less than 1700 grams. Stratification encompassed three groups: 500 g to 999 g; 1000 g to 1499 g, and 1500 g to 1699 g. All infants were fed by nasogastric tube until they weighed 1600 grams, at which time breastfeeding was encouraged. If supplemental feeds were required, they were offered feeding by the assigned method. Prior to the study, there was education of all staff about cup feeding technique. After a week of oral feeds, monitoring was begun by an investigator who examined oxygen saturation before, during and after the feed. Weight gain and feed interval were also recorded. Follow-up was conducted until the third month or when the infant weaned.</P>
<P>The main outcome measure was to examine the impact of cup and bottle feeding on subsequent breastfeeding of preterm infants. Secondary outcomes examined the difference between oxygen saturation levels in bottle, cup and breastfed infants.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Yilmaz--2014" TYPE="STUDY">Yilmaz 2014</LINK> conducted a randomised controlled trial in three hospitals in Turkey comparing the effect of cup versus bottle feeding on exclusive breastfeeding rates in infants between 32 and 35 weeks' gestation; however cup feeding was not initiated until infants were 35 weeks of age. Infants became eligible for the study once intermittent feeding by gastric tube had commenced, thus the infants were receiving some breastfeeds. A large number of mothers lived regionally from the recruitment hospitals and were able to visit their infants at least twice per week. Infants were randomised to either bottle or cup feeding and commencement of the allocated feeding method was determined by the attending physician; all infants were late preterm on commencement. A power calculation based on the exclusive breastfeeding rate at six months determined that 766 infants (383 per group) were required. The total number of infants randomised was 607, of which 40 (13%) in the bottle feeding group and 45 (15%) in the cup feeding group were excluded from the analysis due to non-compliance or development of a disease preventing oral feeding. Follow-up was at one week and then monthly until infants were six months of age, at which time breastfeeding status was recorded and compliance to assigned feeding methods was assessed using a questionnaire.</P>
<P>The main outcome measure was weight gain at day seven of the study and the proportion of exclusive or any breastfeeding on discharge. Secondary outcomes included length of stay and prevalence of exclusive or any breastfeeding at three and six months of age.</P>

<P>This review sought to determine the effect of cup feeding as a supplemental feeding method on weight gain and achievement of exclusive breastfeeding in term and preterm infants. We identified five studies that compared cup feeding to other methods of supplemental feeding (e.g. bottle feeding). All five studies enrolled only preterm infants.</P>
<P>Of the five studies, only two reported results for weight gain in the first week (<LINK REF="STD-Rocha-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Rocha 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yilmaz--2014" TYPE="STUDY">Yilmaz 2014</LINK>), which found no significant difference between the groups.</P>
<P>The results of this update demonstrate considerable variation in results for some breastfeeding outcomes while others showed statistically significant differences favouring cup feeding over bottle feeding.

For the important outcomes of exclusive breastfeeding at three and six months the meta-analysis favours cup feeding; however these results should be treated with caution given the high degree of heterogeneity and the very low quality of evidence particularly for these outcomes (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>).</P>
<P>Further secondary outcomes were average time to feed which was reported in two studies and showed no difference between the two groups (<LINK REF="STD-Rocha-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Rocha 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yilmaz--2014" TYPE="STUDY">Yilmaz 2014</LINK>).

</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2016-08-16 11:40:56 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We found no randomised controlled trials that compared the intervention in the term newborn population. Therefore the results of this review are only applicable to preterm infants.</P>
<P>All of the included trials were conducted in upper-middle income and high-income countries, therefore these data are relevant to current clinical practice in the care of preterm infants in such countries. Evidence was provided on the effect on weight gain and breastfeeding outcomes for preterm infants receiving supplemental feeds by cup. In an environment where hospitals are attempting to reduce length of stay, a finding such as this will significantly affect financial and bed-management resources. The cost implications related to length of stay need to be considered against a short-term gain in exclusive breastfeeding at discharge.</P>
<P>It is unclear how applicable this evidence is to neonatal care practices in low-income countries and in those countries culturally familiar with traditional implements, such as the paladai cup, compared to 'cups' used in high-income countries. Additionally in those countries with limited or no clean water supplies, or limited sterilisation equipment, cup feeding may still be the practice of choice.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2016-08-16 11:42:14 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The methodological quality of the included studies was low to very low, suggesting that the results of the meta-analyses need to be treated with extreme caution (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>).</P>
<P>Generally it was not possible to mask caregivers to the nature of the intervention, thus increasing the likelihood of performance bias. Lack of blinding also increases the likelihood of contamination. All studies included in this review had high rates of contamination in the intervention group, with many infants randomised to the cup-feeding group actually receiving bottle feeds. This may have diluted any effects of cup feeding &#8212; both positive and negative. However this may have been due to the impracticality of the intervention: for example in <LINK REF="STD-Collins-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Collins 2004</LINK>, 56% of those allocated to cup feeding had some bottle feeds (with over 90% of those mothers not liking, or having significant problems with, cup feeding).</P>
<P>There was also little blinding of any outcome assessments in four of the five studies (especially the single dominant study by <LINK REF="STD-Collins-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Collins 2004</LINK>). Such blinding could have been possible, and if done would have decreased the likelihood of detection bias.<BR/>

<LINK REF="STD-Abouelfettoh-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Abouelfettoh 2008</LINK> studied cup versus bottle feeding in a preterm population in Egypt. This was a quasi-experimental cohort design. The intention of the study was to report breastfeeding outcomes up to six weeks post hospital discharge. This paper reports a difference between the two groups at one week post discharge only and cites that outcome data up to six weeks was not feasible due to low maternal education. That is, maternal recall regarding breastfeeding practices could not be relied upon over the six weeks. Additionally the authors report that the cup-feeding group displayed more mature breastfeeding behaviours over the six weeks; however this needs to be viewed with caution as only 13 or the 30 infants were assessed at six weeks.</P>
<P>The Baby Friendly Health Initiative (BFHI) is &#8220;a global standard based on evidence&#8221; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1998</LINK>. One of the 10 steps of the BHFI initiative includes the need to offer supplemental feeds without the use of bottles and teats and therefore BFHI promotes cup feeding as the alternative when infants are not able to breastfeed (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1998</LINK>) and that &#8220;current evidence related to alternative methods of feeding undergoes extensive review by the World Health Organization&#8221; (personal communication, Rachel Ford, Australian College of Midwives). Whilst this is appreciated, there is limited evidence and no high-quality randomised controlled trials involving only term infants in either high- or low-resource settings. In addition there are reports in the literature that cup feeding can create problems in the term population. If accreditation processes such as BFHI state evidence as the basis of practice, the interpretation of current evidence about cup feeding is of a biased perspective. Evidence put forward by BFHI is not 'gold standard' and does not address the issue of increased length of stay and parental choice. Organisations and individuals should be supported in choosing alternative supplemental methods, in addition to cup feeding, until successful breastfeeding can be achieved.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Huang-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Huang 2009</LINK>, a longitudinal study undertaken in Northern Taiwan, used questionnaires and telephone calls to obtain information on full-term infant feeding behaviour and mother's milk supply. Exclusively breast-fed infant outcomes were compared to those infants who received supplemental feeds via cup or bottle. Infants were recruited at different times to avoid interaction of the groups. The cup-feeding group was recruited over a one-month period at the end of 2005. The bottle-feeding group was recruited during February 2006. The reported result in the abstract was that "the bottle group was significantly more fretful during breastfeeding". The authors measured negative sucking behaviours, in which there were no difference in negative behaviour on initial feeding or at two and four weeks, only on day 3. Thus it is difficult to ascertain how and when 'fretful' was measured as fretful was not a measured outcome presented in the paper. Additionally the authors conclude that "cup-feeding was better than bottle-feeding", although there is a lack of data in this paper to draw such a conclusion. Furthermore the authors state that they found "no significant correlation between infant feeding method and infant sucking competence". Thus the commentary by <LINK REF="REF-Han-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Han 2010</LINK> reporting that the study by <LINK REF="STD-Huang-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Huang 2009</LINK> showed cup-feeding had beneficial effects over bottle feeding needs to be viewed with caution. Additionally the second study referred to in this commentary (<LINK REF="STD-Gupta-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Gupta 1999</LINK>), conducted in India, may suggest that cup feeding is a viable option in under-resourced countries; however the scientific data are inconclusive and further robust, well-designed studies are needed.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2016-08-16 12:00:56 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>While the limitations of the studies included in the review might lead us to conclude that further large high-quality randomised controlled trials should be undertaken in developed countries, the issue of high rates of non-compliance with the intervention of cup feeding by both practitioners and parents, as reported in the majority of previous studies, may make this a futile undertaking. Should nipple confusion and supplementation with bottles, and impact on breastfeeding rates and duration remain a concern, then this should be the focus for future research rather than cup feeding. Traditional interventions aimed at maintaining breastfeeding longer term (e.g. early breastfeeds, early and regular skin-to-skin contact, rooming in, non-separation of mother and baby as much as possible, non-introduction of supplemental feeds unless medically indicated, and antenatal breastfeeding education as documented in <LINK REF="REF-WHO-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1998</LINK>) should also be given due consideration before further trials of cup feeding are undertaken.</P>

<REFERENCE MODIFIED="2016-02-19 09:54:15 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="Colleen Ovelman" NOTES="&lt;p&gt;A dual intervention study was conducted by &lt;a link_type=&quot;STUDY&quot; href=&quot;Howard 2003&quot; protected=&quot;true&quot;&gt;Howard 2003&lt;/a&gt; to evaluate the effects of pacifier use, cup feeding and bottle feeding on breastfeeding. Women were initially contacted prenatally and those women who intended to breastfeed for at least four weeks, had uncomplicated, singleton pregnancies and who were undecided about pacifier use were eligible. Participants were term infants (median gestational ages 39.7 weeks). On admission, for impending delivery, the unborn infant was randomised to a cup or bottle supplemental group and early (2-5 days) or late (&amp;gt;4 weeks) introduction to a pacifier group. Of a total of 807 infants recruited prenatally, 107 infants were ineligible post delivery as they required admission to the neonatal intensive care unit or because mothers no longer intended to breast feed or declined further participation. Of a total of 700 infants, 364 and 336 were randomised to cup or bottle feeding supplements respectively (before it was known if supplements would be required). Within these two groups, infants were then further randomised to receiving pacifiers early or late. Of the 364 and 336 infants randomised to either cup or bottle supplements, only 251 and 230 infants within each of the respective groups required supplements as the remaining infants randomised initially to cup or bottle did not require supplements as they exclusively breast fed. Mothers and infants were followed up postnatally at 2, 5, 10, 16, 24, 38 and 52 weeks by a nurse masked to group assignment. Mothers were interviewed to assess breastfeeding duration and difficulties experienced. Compliance with follow-up was encouraged by compensation in the form of gifts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The main outcome measures were duration of breastfeeding and breastfeeding associated maternal and infant problems. Sub group analysis was undertaken for primiparity, level of education and caesarean section rates.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" NOTES_MODIFIED="2016-02-19 09:54:15 -0500" NOTES_MODIFIED_BY="Colleen Ovelman" PRIMARY="NO" TYPE="JOURNAL_ARTICLE">

<BR/>Feedback:<BR/>Conclusions of the Cochrane review on cup feeding for newborns unable to fully breastfeed are not supported by the findings </P>
<P>This recently published systematic Cochrane review based on four relatively small studies makes a general conclusion "Cup feeding cannot be recommended over bottle feeding as a supplement to breastfeeding because it confers no significant benefit in maintaining breastfeeding beyond hospital discharge and carries the unacceptable consequence of longer stay in hospital" (1). We feel that the findings of the review do not support this conclusion. Justification for this feeling is provided below. </P>
<P>The risk of infection should be an important consideration in the choice of feeding method. One of the major potential advantages of cup feeding over bottle feeding is in reducing the risk of infection, particularly in developing countries. All studies (2-4) included in the review except a small study from Brazil (5) are from developed countries and none has reported on the risk of infection. Although infection was included as an outcome in the protocol for this Cochrane review, the lack of data on this important outcome is not discussed. </P>
<P>On the outcomes on which data is presented, the number of participants in all studies is small. The total number of infants included in the meta-analysis on any breastfeeding is about 400. For comparison, in another study in term infants, Howard et al estimated that at least 700 infants would be needed to detect a  10% difference in breastfeeding cessation with 90% power and 5% significance level (6). The lack of significant effect on many outcomes could therefore have been just because of lack of statistical power. We think that the "lack of evidence of effect" cannot be taken as the "evidence of lack of effect".</P>
<P>The authors base their conclusions on their findings related to the lack of significant benefit of cup feeding beyond hospital discharge. However, all the studies included in the review were hospital studies with the primary outcomes limited to the time of hospital discharge. Only two studies reported effect at 3 months and one study at 6 months after discharge, as a secondary outcome. It is clear that even in these studies, sample sizes were not calculated, follow up was not complete and the quality of data cannot therefore be considered to be same as that for the primary outcome. Considering only the primary outcomes, there was a 18% non-significant benefit in any breastfeeding and 25% significant benefit in full breastfeeding rates associated with cup feeding. While these findings cannot be considered conclusive in favour of cup feeding, they are certainly indicative of a benefit. In any case, this is clearly not evidence of lack of benefit.  </P>
<P>One of the possible reasons for only a modest benefit of cup feeding on subsequent breastfeeding could be the lack of compliance with the allocated intervention. Although the authors of the Cochrane review have recognized this, we think that they have not discussed it appropriately. For example, the researchers in the largest included study (2) considered the lack of compliance as the main limitation of their study which could have lead to an underestimate of the effect. Indeed, the researchers state in their paper that "Compliance analysis showed a significant increase in the prevalence of any breastfeeding with cup feeding (Odds ratio 21.09, 95% CI 2.62 to 169.75, P = 0.004) with no significant difference in length of hospital stay (hazard ratio 0.82, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.17, P = 0.27). Such compliance analysis needs to be interpreted with caution and highlight the need for further research." Further, they state that "Compliance differed between recruiting hospitals, the hospital with the better compliance has used cup feeding before, in the other it was introduced for the trial. Most peripheral hospitals had not used cup feeding before. Some staff had strong feelings against cup feeding?". The authors of the Cochrane review have not considered the lack of previous experience of staff with a new feeding method as one of the potential causes of lack of compliance with cup feeding. </P>
<P>The finding related to length of hospital stay (about a 15% increase in the duration of stay) needs to be interpreted with caution as it comes from a single study. Further, a possible reason for this could again be the lack of confidence of the treating physicians about the ability of the mother to feed the infant related to less experience in having used cup feeding relative to bottle feeding. </P>
<P>The conclusions and the plain language summary seem to indicate that the findings of this review are generalizable to all infants, in all settings. However, the studies reviewed included only those preterm infants who are not able to fully breastfeed. In this regard, it is important to consider the findings of an excluded study in term, healthy, breast fed infants (Howard et al), which show that for infants who received more than 2 supplemental feeds per day, cup feeding has distinct advantage over bottle feeding on breastfeeding duration. Also the findings may not be applicable to preterm infants in developing country settings. </P>
<P>Finally, we find the authors' conclusion that conducting further large, high quality RCTs on this issue may be a "futile undertaking" highly questionable. As stated above the problem of compliance in previous studies is an argument for doing better designed studies in health facilities that have experience in both cup and bottle feeding. Further, the importance of other factors like skin to skin contact, rooming in etc. should not be used an argument for not conducting research on appropriate feeding methods for infants who are not able to fully breastfeed. In our opinion, this meta-analysis underscores the need for further well-designed studies on this subject, in both developing and developed countries. </P>

<P>Thank you for your comment on our review "Cup feeding versus other forms of supplemental enteral feeding for newborn infants unable to fully breastfeed".</P>
<P>The authors disagree with the statement from Rajiv B et al that the findings from the review do not support the conclusion. The conclusions were drawn from the evidence presented in the four included randomised control trials. </P>
<P>The author&#8217;s acknowledge that infection is important and thus, it was included as an outcome. A thorough literature search was undertaken on all published and unpublished studies and no data from either randomised nor non-randomised trials was found for this outcome. Several other papers from India (<LINK REF="STD-Gupta-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Gupta 1999</LINK>, Malhotrata 1998) were found. Whilst they were not eligible to be included in the review, again neither of these two papers considered or discussed risks of infection, despite one discussing different utensils for delivering milk. Given that milk delivered by any utensil, irrespective of whether it is a bottle, teat, spoon or cup, each require cleaning. The authors do not feel that conducting a trial on comparing different delivery utensils and infection rates is of benefit. Without any supporting evidence or discussion in any papers regarding cup feeding in developing countries, the authors are reluctant to discuss and draw conclusions regarding this outcome We have acknowledged in the text of the review under unreported outcomes, "that none of the following outcomes were reported in any of the included studies". </P>
<P>Rajiv B et al comment on methodological influences which the authors have no impact on, such as sample size calculation. The statement made by the authors in the review is based on the evidence available; inferences cannot be made about design and sample size estimation by the authors. At this point in time there is a lack of evidence of effect. </P>
<P>Rajiv B et al again comment on design and methodology. The authors disagree with the comments and are adamant conclusions can only be based on the evidence found to be included in the review. </P>
<P>It is not the role of authors of Cochrane reviews to hypothesise on potential causes for lack of compliance for any intervention. </P>
<P>Again, the authors have presented the data available from included studies. </P>
<P>In reference to the excluded paper of healthy term newborn infants; this study was excluded because the population studied were healthy, term infants that were able to fully breastfeed; with supplemental feeds being offered as maternal choice, not because these were infants who were unable to fully breastfeed. This review is addressing the issue of supplemental feeds in the population of infants (irrespective of gestational age) who are unable to fully breastfeed. The authors have the view that term infants who can be fully breast fed should not be offered supplemental feeds as per the Baby Friendly Hospital Initiative (WHO1998). In addition, there are reports in the literature that caution needs to be exercised when cup feeding term infants due to the different tongue action required from that of breastfeeding, and term infants may reject the breast. </P>
<P>In the majority of the articles reviewed, the authors of these papers made a comment about the difficulty of ensuring compliance with this intervention. This is often the reality of conducting clinical trials in clinical settings with clinical staff. In this case, the authors do not feel that it was a question of poorly designed clinical trials.</P>
<P>Based on the current literature and the evidence that was reviewed, the authors disagree with the closing comment and maintain their conclusion. </P>
<P>The authors look forward to updating this review should further randomised controlled trials be conducted.   </P>
<P>In conclusion, if WHO have any unpublished data regarding term infants that are unable to fully breastfeed, we would be happy to include it in future updates of the review. </P>

<P>1. Sequence generation: was the allocation sequence adequately generated? For each included study we described the method used to generate the allocation sequence.<BR/>We assessed the methods as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>low risk (any truly random process, e.g. random number table; computer random number generator);</LI>
<LI>high risk (any non-random process, e.g. odd or even date of birth; hospital or clinic record number);</LI>
<LI>unclear risk.</LI>
</UL>
<P>2. Allocation concealment: Was allocation adequately concealed? For each included study, we described the method used to conceal the allocation sequence and determined whether intervention allocation could have been foreseen in advance of, or during recruitment, of changed after assignment.<BR/>We assessed the methods as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>low risk (e.g. telephone or central randomisation; consecutively numbered sealed opaque envelopes);</LI>
<LI>high risk (open random allocation; unsealed or non-opaque envelopes, alternation; date of birth);</LI>
<LI>unclear risk.</LI>
</UL>
<P>3. Blinding of participants, personnel and outcome assessors: was knowledge of the allocated intervention adequately prevented during the study? Of the four included studies blinding of the intervention was not possible for participants or personnel. However blinded assessment of some outcome measures were possible.</P>
<P>4. Incomplete outcome data: were incomplete outcome data adequately addressed? For each included study and for each outcome, we described the completeness of data including attrition and exclusions from the analysis. We stated whether attrition and exclusions were reported, the numbers included in the analysis at each stage (compared with the total randomised participants), reasons for attrition or exclusion where reported, and whether missing data were balanced across groups or were related to outcomes.<BR/>We assessed the methods as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>low risk;</LI>
<LI>high risk;</LI>
<LI>unclear risk.</LI>
</UL>
<P>5. Selective outcome reporting: are reports of the study free of suggestion of selective outcome reporting? For each included study we described how we examined the possibility of selective outcome reporting bias and what we found.<BR/>We assessed the methods as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>low risk (where it is clear that all of the study's pre-specified outcomes and all expected outcomes of interest to the review have been reported);</LI>
<LI>high risk (where not all the study's pre-specified outcomes have been reported; one or more reported primary outcomes were not pre-specified; outcomes of interest are reported incompletely and so cannot be used; study fails to include results of a key outcome that would have been expected to have been reported);</LI>
<LI>unclear risk.</LI>
</UL>
<P>6. Other sources of bias: Was the study apparently free of other problems that could put it at a high risk of bias? For each included study, we described any important concerns regarding other possible sources of bias.<BR/>We assessed whether each study was free of other problems that could put it at risk of bias:</P>
<UL>
<LI>low risk;</LI>
<LI>high risk;</LI>
<LI>unclear risk.</LI>
