<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2017-01-26 10:51:18 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>
<B>What is the issue?</B>
</P>
<P>Is continuous cardiotocography (CTG) to electronically monitor babies' heartbeats and wellbeing during labour better at identifying problems than listening intermittently?</P>
<P>
<B>Why is this important?</B>
</P>
<P>Monitoring babies' heartbeats is used to check wellbeing during labour. Listening and recording the baby's heartbeat aims to identify babies who are becoming short of oxygen and may benefit from an early delivery by caesarean section or instrumental vaginal birth.</P>
<P>A baby's heartbeat can be monitored intermittently using a special trumpet-shaped device, or hand-held Doppler device. The heartbeat can also be checked continuously using a CTG machine. Continuous CTG produces a paper recording of the baby's heart rate and the mother's labour contractions. Although continuous CTG provides a written record, mothers cannot move freely during labour, change positions easily, or use a birthing pool to help with comfort and control during labour. It also means that some resources tend to be focused on the need to constantly interpret the CTG and not on the needs of a woman in labour.</P>
<P>
<B>What evidence did we find?</B>
</P>
<P>We searched for evidence on 30 November 2016, but found no new studies for this update. We included 12 trials that compared continuous CTG monitoring with intermittent listening, and one trial compared continuous CTG with intermittent CTG. Together, the trials involved over 37,000 women. No trial compared continuous CTG with no monitoring. Most studies were undertaken before 1994, and apart from two, were not high quality. The review was dominated by one large, well-conducted trial from 1985 which involved almost 13,000 women who received one-to-one care throughout labour. The mothers' membranes were ruptured artificially as early as possible and about a quarter received oxytocin to stimulate contractions.</P>
<P>Overall, there was no difference in numbers of babies who died during or shortly after labour (about one in 300) (low quality evidence). Fits in babies were rare (about one in 500 births) (moderate quality evidence), but occurred less often when continuous CTG was used to monitor the baby's heart rate. There was no difference in the rate of cerebral palsy (low quality evidence); however, other possible long-term effects have not been fully assessed and need further study. Continuous monitoring was associated with significantly more deliveries by caesarean section (low quality evidence) and instrumental vaginal births (low quality evidence). Although both procedures carry risks for mothers, these were not assessed in the included studies.</P>
<P>There was no difference in numbers of cord blood acidosis (very low quality evidence), or women using any drugs for pain relief (low quality evidence) between groups.</P>
<P>Compared with intermittent CTG, continuous CTG made no difference to how many women had caesarean sections or instrumental births. There was less cord blood acidosis in women who had intermittent CTG but this result could have been due to chance.</P>
<P>
<B>What does this mean?</B>
</P>
<P>Most studies were undertaken many years ago and showed benefits and problems with both methods of monitoring the baby&#8217;s wellbeing in labour. Continuous CTG was associated with fewer fits for babies although there was no difference in cerebral palsy; both were rare events. However, continuous CTG was also associated with increased numbers of caesarean sections and instrumental births, both of which carry risks for mothers. Continuous CTG also makes moving and changing positions difficult in labour and women are unable to use a birthing pool. This can impact on women&#8217;s coping strategies. Women and their doctors need to discuss the woman&#8217;s individual needs and wishes about monitoring the baby&#8217;s wellbeing in labour.</P>
<P>Future research should focus on events that happen in pregnancy and labour that could be the cause of long term problems for the baby.</P>

<P>Cardiotocography (CTG) records changes in the fetal heart rate and their temporal relationship to uterine contractions. The aim is to identify babies who may be short of oxygen (hypoxic) to guide additional assessments of fetal wellbeing, or determine if the baby needs to be delivered by caesarean section or instrumental vaginal birth. This is an update of a review previously published in 2013, 2006 and 2001.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-01-30 14:17:10 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included 13 trials involving over 37,000 women. No new studies were included in this update.</P>
<P>One trial (4044 women) compared continuous CTG with intermittent CTG, all other trials compared continuous CTG with intermittent auscultation. No data were found comparing no fetal monitoring with continuous CTG. Overall, methodological quality was mixed. All included studies were at high risk of performance bias, unclear or high risk of detection bias, and unclear risk of reporting bias. Only two trials were assessed at high methodological quality.</P>
<P>Compared with intermittent auscultation, continuous cardiotocography showed no significant improvement in overall perinatal death rate (risk ratio (RR) 0.86, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.59 to 1.23, N = 33,513, 11 trials, low quality evidence), but was associated with halving neonatal seizure rates (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.80, N = 32,386, 9 trials, moderate quality evidence). There was no difference in cerebral palsy rates (RR 1.75, 95% CI 0.84 to 3.63, N = 13,252, 2 trials, low quality evidence). There was an increase in caesarean sections associated with continuous CTG (RR 1.63, 95% CI 1.29 to 2.07, N = 18,861, 11 trials, low quality evidence). Women were also more likely to have instrumental vaginal births (RR 1.15, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.33, N = 18,615, 10 trials, low quality evidence). There was no difference in the incidence of cord blood acidosis (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.27 to 3.11, N = 2494, 2 trials, very low quality evidence) or use of any pharmacological analgesia (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.09, N = 1677, 3 trials, low quality evidence).</P>
<P>Compared with intermittent CTG, continuous CTG made no difference to caesarean section rates (RR 1.29, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.97, N = 4044, 1 trial) or instrumental births (RR 1.16, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.46, N = 4044, 1 trial). Less cord blood acidosis was observed in women who had intermittent CTG, however, this result could have been due to chance (RR 1.43, 95% CI 0.95 to 2.14, N = 4044, 1 trial).</P>
<P>Data for low risk, high risk, preterm pregnancy and high-quality trials subgroups were consistent with overall results. Access to fetal blood sampling did not appear to influence differences in neonatal seizures or other outcomes.</P>
<P>Evidence was assessed using GRADE. Most outcomes were graded as low quality evidence (rates of perinatal death, cerebral palsy, caesarean section, instrumental vaginal births, and any pharmacological analgesia), and downgraded for limitations in design, inconsistency and imprecision of results. The remaining outcomes were downgraded to moderate quality (neonatal seizures) and very low quality (cord blood acidosis) due to similar concerns over limitations in design, inconsistency and imprecision.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2017-01-30 14:21:51 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>CTG during labour is associated with reduced rates of neonatal seizures, but no clear differences in cerebral palsy, infant mortality or other standard measures of neonatal wellbeing. However, continuous CTG was associated with an increase in caesarean sections and instrumental vaginal births. The challenge is how best to convey these results to women to enable them to make an informed decision without compromising the normality of labour.</P>
<P>The question remains as to whether future randomised trials should measure efficacy (the intrinsic value of continuous CTG in trying to prevent adverse neonatal outcomes under optimal clinical conditions) or effectiveness (the effect of this technique in routine clinical practice).</P>
<P>Along with the need for further investigations into long-term effects of operative births for women and babies, much remains to be learned about the causation and possible links between antenatal or intrapartum events, neonatal seizures and long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes, whilst considering changes in clinical practice over the intervening years (one-to-one-support during labour, caesarean section rates). The large number of babies randomised to the trials in this review have now reached adulthood and could potentially provide a unique opportunity to clarify if a reduction in neonatal seizures is something inconsequential that should not greatly influence women's and clinicians' choices, or if seizure reduction leads to long-term benefits for babies. Defining meaningful neurological and behavioural outcomes that could be measured in large cohorts of young adults poses huge challenges. However, it is important to collect data from these women and babies while medical records still exist, where possible describe women's mobility and positions during labour and birth, and clarify if these might impact on outcomes. Research should also address the possible contribution of the supine position to adverse outcomes for babies, and assess whether the use of mobility and positions can further reduce the low incidence of neonatal seizures and improve psychological outcomes for women.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2017-02-01 14:10:33 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The baby's heart beat was first thought to be heard in utero in the middle of the seventeenth or eighteenth century (<LINK REF="REF-Grant-1989a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grant 1989a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gibb-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gibb 1992</LINK>), but it was not until the early nineteenth century that de Kergeradee suggested that listening to the baby's heartbeat might be clinically useful (<LINK REF="REF-Grant-1989a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grant 1989a</LINK>). De Kergeradee proposed that listening to the baby's heartbeat could be used to diagnose fetal life and multiple pregnancies, and wondered if it would be possible to assess fetal compromise from variations in the fetal heart rate (FHR). Since then, various methods of listening to the fetal heart have been developed and introduced into maternity care (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>), each with the aim of improving outcomes for babies and reducing the heartache for mothers and families when a baby dies or sustains long-term disability. Today, monitoring the fetal heart during labour, by one method or another, appears to have become a routine part of care during labour, although access to such care varies across the world.</P>
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2017-01-17 04:06:06 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Ann Jones">
<P>The incidence of neonatal morbidity and mortality varies around the world, although direct comparisons may be difficult because of varying definitions and classifications. Nevertheless, large differences are reported between high-income countries with average neonatal mortality rates (NMR) of four per 1000 live births) and low- or middle-income countries with average NMRs of 33 per 1000 births) (<LINK REF="REF-Lawn-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lawn 2005</LINK>). Although most perinatal morbidity and mortality may not be prevented by improved fetal monitoring in labour (<LINK REF="REF-Nelson-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nelson 1996</LINK>), failure in identifying abnormal FHR patterns and lack of appropriate actions are considered to be significant contributing factors (<LINK REF="REF-MCHRC-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">MCHRC 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-MCHRC-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">MCHRC 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-MCHRC-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">MCHRC 1999</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2017-02-01 14:10:33 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The baby's heart rate can be monitored either intermittently (at regular intervals during labour) or continuously (recording the baby's heart rate throughout labour, stopping only briefly, such as for visits to the toilet) as follows.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Fetal stethoscope (Pinard) and hand-held Doppler</HEADING>
<P>Intermittent monitoring can be undertaken either by listening to the baby's heart rate using a fetal stethoscope (Pinard), or with a hand-held Doppler ultrasound device, and by palpating the mother's uterine contractions by hand. This is known as intermittent auscultation.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Cardiotocograph (CTG)</HEADING>
<P>The baby's heart rate and the mother's uterine contractions can be recorded electronically on a paper trace known as a cardiotocograph. This is done using a Doppler ultrasound transducer to monitor the baby's heart rate and a pressure transducer to monitor uterine contractions, both of which are linked to a recording device. This is known as external cardiotocography (external CTG) and is usually undertaken continuously in labour, although it is sometimes used intermittently (intermittent CTG). In most units, external CTG requires the mother to wear a belt across her abdomen during monitoring, which restricts her mobility. An alternative means of monitoring the baby's heart rate with the CTG machine is to attach an electrode directly to the baby's presenting part, usually the head. This form of continuous monitoring is known as internal CTG and requires a ruptured amniotic sac (either spontaneously or artificially) and a scalp electrode (clip) attached to the baby's head. This also restricts the woman's mobility.</P>
<P>The term electronic fetal monitoring (EFM) is sometimes used synonymously with CTG monitoring, but is considered to be a less precise term because CTG monitoring also includes monitoring the mother's contractions, and other forms of fetal monitoring might also be classed as 'electronic', such as fetal electrocardiograph or fetal pulse oximetry.<BR/>
<BR/>Intermittent auscultation was the predominant method of monitoring during labour until CTGs became widely used in the latter part of the twentieth century (<LINK REF="REF-Enkin-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Enkin 2000</LINK>). Although there is a lack of empirical evidence on the optimal frequency of intermittent auscultation, there is a consensus in clinical guidelines that the fetal heart should be auscultated at least every 15 minutes in the first stage of labour and at least every five minutes in the second stage of labour (<LINK REF="REF-ACOG-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">ACOG 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Liston-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liston 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NICE-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-RANZCOG-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">RANZCOG 2014</LINK>) with each auscultation lasting at least 60 seconds (<LINK REF="REF-Liston-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liston 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NICE-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2014</LINK>). It appears that these auscultation protocols were developed initially in the context of clinical trials and were based on common sense rather than research evidence. Compliance with these guidelines, whilst maintaining contemporaneous records, poses a significant challenge for caregivers during labour who usually have multiple tasks to fulfil simultaneously.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Information and interpretation</HEADING>
<P>Both intermittent auscultation and CTG provide information on the baseline heart rate (usually between 110 and 160 beats per minute in the term fetus), accelerations (transient increases in the FHR) and decelerations (transient decreases in the FHR). Some aspects of labour cause natural alterations in FHR patterns. For example, the baby's sleep FHR pattern differs from the waking FHR pattern. External stimuli, such as uterine contractions and the mother moving, can cause FHR changes, as can administration of opiates to the mother. Some of these changes are subtle and can only be detected by continuous CTG, such as baseline variability and temporal shape of decelerations. Consideration is needed about whether such information improves detection and outcomes for babies who are truly compromised and if there are technology-related disadvantages for those who are not compromised.</P>

<P>While specific abnormalities of the FHR pattern on CTG are proposed as being associated with an increased risk of cerebral palsy (<LINK REF="REF-Nelson-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nelson 1996</LINK>), CTG specificity to predict cerebral palsy is low, with a reported false positive rate as high as 99.8%, even in the presence of multiple late decelerations or decreased variability (<LINK REF="REF-Nelson-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nelson 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>FHR pattern recognition, including the relationship between uterine contractions and FHR decelerations, are fundamental to the use of continuous CTG monitoring. Algorithms have been developed to assess and record what is normal, what requires more careful attention, and what is considered abnormal requiring immediate delivery of the baby (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2014</LINK>). However, CTG traces are often interpreted differently by different caregivers (inter-observer variation) and even by the same caregiver interpreting the same record at different times (intra-observer variation) (<LINK REF="REF-Devane-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Devane 2005</LINK>). Such variation in interpretation of CTG tracings may result in inappropriate interventions, or false reassurance and lack of appropriate intervention. Although we were unable to find studies that sought to investigate inter- and intra-observer variation in intermittent auscultation, it would seem reasonable to suggest that intermittent auscultation is not immune to similar problems caused by inter- and intra-observer variation. However, given that the FHR parameter of interest in intermittent auscultation is the baseline FHR, it is likely that inter- and intra-observer variation is less in intermittent auscultation than that found in CTG interpretation where other aspects of FHR patterns including variability and assessment and deceleration classification require interpretation.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Additional tests</HEADING>
<P>Fetal blood sampling is a procedure where a small amount of blood is taken from the baby, usually from the scalp. Performing fetal blood sampling and measuring the parameters of acid-base balance (pH, base excess/deficit, etc) seeks to identify those babies who are truly compromised and need to be born immediately. It is important to establish the value of this test as an adjunct to CTG. This question was addressed in a subgroup analysis in this review.</P>
<P>Other methods have been considered as additional tests, but there is little evidence to support their use, for example, vibroacoustic stimulation (<LINK REF="REF-East-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">East 2013</LINK>). Several other methods of fetal monitoring have been proposed, either as an adjunct or an alternative to CTG, such as pulse oximetry (<LINK REF="REF-Carbonne-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carbonne 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-East-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">East 2007</LINK>), near-infrared spectroscopy (<LINK REF="REF-Mozurkewich-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mozurkewich 2000</LINK>), fetal ECG (<LINK REF="REF-Neilson-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Neilson 2015</LINK>), ST segment analysis of the fetal ECG (<LINK REF="REF-Luttkus-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Luttkus 2004</LINK>). and fetal stimulation tests (<LINK REF="REF-Skupski-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Skupski 2002</LINK>).</P>

<OL>
<LI>Continuous CTG is generally recommended for women who are regarded as being at increased risk of perinatal morbidity and mortality (<LINK REF="REF-Liston-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liston 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NICE-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-RANZCOG-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">RANZCOG 2014</LINK>). This review addressed the issue of differential effects of CTG in terms of risk status.</LI>
<LI>Induction of labour is primarily performed where it is anticipated that outcomes for mothers and infants would be improved were labour induced. Given that induction of labour includes iatrogenic stimulation of uterine activity, which puts the baby at greater risk, we determined to perform a subgroup analysis by induction of labour (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2008</LINK>).</LI>
<LI>Preterm birth is associated with an increased risk of mortality and neurological morbidity, and these babies might benefit from being monitored more intensively. Further, there is debate about what is normal for the different parameters of the CTG for preterm infants at varying gestational ages. Therefore, we performed a preterm subgroup analysis.</LI>
<LI>Twin pregnancies carry a higher perinatal mortality rate than singleton pregnancies (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2011</LINK>), thus we conducted a subgroup analysis by twin pregnancy.</LI>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Women's and professional views</HEADING>
<P>Some studies looking at women's preferences found that the support that women received from staff and labour companions was more important to them than the type of monitoring used (<LINK REF="REF-Garcia-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Garcia 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Killien-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Killien 1989</LINK>). A more recent study of women's views of routine continuous CTG in labour in the UK identified a lack of discussion about the need for and appropriateness of CTG. In addition, women felt that CTG limited their mobility and led to an acceptance of the machine's place as the focus of attention for the woman and her partner (<LINK REF="REF-Munro-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Munro 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>In a synthesis of 11 studies on professionals&#8217; views of FHR monitoring during labour, <LINK REF="REF-Smith-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smith 2012</LINK> identified that despite an absence of evidence, maternity care professionals perceived the CTG as offering 'proof' of the compromised baby and that this minimises their exposure to criticism and potential litigation. Nevertheless, professionals also recognised that the CTG offered a false sense of security.</P>

<P>Although monitoring FHR changes during labour, it is hoped to identify those babies who may be compromised, or potentially compromised, by a shortage of oxygen (fetal hypoxia). If the shortage of oxygen is both prolonged and severe, babies are at risk of being born with a disability (physical, mental or both), or death during labour or shortly thereafter. When alterations in the FHR during labour suggest that the baby is hypoxic, or at risk of hypoxia, additional methods of assessment of fetal wellbeing (e.g. fetal blood sampling) may be used. Sometimes FHR alterations trigger delivery by caesarean section or use of instruments, such as forceps or vacuum extractor, even without recourse to additional diagnostic tests.</P>

If we use ICCs from other sources, we will report this and conduct sensitivity analyses to investigate the effect of variation in the ICC. If we identify both cluster-randomised trials and individually-randomised trials, we plan to synthesise the relevant information.

In future updates, to take account of the non-independence of outcomes for babies from multiple pregnancies, we will treat each multiple pregnancy as a cluster and analyse data using methods described for cluster-randomised trials. We will seek ICCs for outcomes for twins and higher multiples from trials (if available) from similar trials or from observational studies.

<P>Levels of attrition were noted for included studies. In future updates, if more eligible studies are included, the impact of including studies with high levels of missing data on the overall assessment of treatment effect will be explored in sensitivity analyses.</P>
<P>For all outcomes, analyses were carried out, as far as possible, on an intention-to-treat basis. That is, we attempted to include all participants randomised to each group in the analyses. The denominator for each outcome in each trial was the number of participants randomised minus any participants whose outcomes were known to be missing.</P>

<HETEROGENEITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2017-01-17 07:19:39 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Ann Jones">
<P>We assessed statistical heterogeneity in meta-analyses using the Tau, I and Chi statistics. We regarded heterogeneity as substantial if I was greater than 30% and either Tau was greater than zero, or there was a low P value (&lt; 0.10) in the Chi test for heterogeneity. If we identified substantial heterogeneity (&gt; 30%), we planned to explore it by pre-specified subgroup analysis.</P>

<DATA_SYNTHESIS MODIFIED="2017-01-17 07:22:01 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Ann Jones">
<P>We carried out statistical analysis using Review Manager software (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2014</LINK>). We used fixed-effect meta-analysis for combining data where it was reasonable to assume that studies were estimating the same underlying treatment effect: that is, where trials were examining the same intervention, and the trials&#8217; populations and methods were judged to be sufficiently similar.</P>
<P>If there was clinical heterogeneity sufficient to expect that the underlying treatment effects differed among trials, or if substantial statistical heterogeneity was detected, we used random-effects meta-analysis to produce an overall summary if an average treatment effect across trials was considered clinically meaningful. The random-effects summary was to be treated as the average range of possible treatment effects and we planned to discuss the clinical implications of treatment effects differing among trials. If the average treatment effect was not clinically meaningful, we did not combine trials. If we used random-effects analyses, the results were presented as the average treatment effect with 95% confidence intervals, and the estimates of Tau and I.</P>

<P>There was no significant difference in perinatal mortality between the groups. Risk ratio (RR) was 0.86 with, 95% confidence intervals (CIs) ranging from 0.59 to 1.24, N = 33,513, 11 trials, (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>). The funnel plot analysis indicated no missing studies (<LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>). The quality of the evidence for this outcome was assessed as moderate (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>).</P>
<P>The use of continuous CTG monitoring in labour halved the risk of neonatal seizures (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.80, N = 32,386, 9 trials, <LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>). The funnel plot indicated no missing studies (<LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK>) and the quality of the evidence was assessed as moderate (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>). This reduction was consistent across the trials and subgroups, although the incidence of neonatal seizures varied considerably among trials. In the two largest trials of 14,618 women (<LINK REF="STD-Dallas-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Dallas 1986</LINK>) and 12,964 women (<LINK REF="STD-Dublin-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Dublin 1985</LINK>), the incidence of neonatal seizures in the intermittent auscultation groups was 0.04% and 0.4% respectively (<LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>). In the two high-quality trials reporting data for this outcome (<LINK REF="STD-Dublin-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Dublin 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Melbourne-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Melbourne 1976</LINK>), the risk of neonatal seizures was RR 0.40, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.77 (<LINK REF="CMP-008.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 8.2</LINK>).</P>
<P>There was no difference in the incidence of cerebral palsy (average RR 1.75, 95% CI 0.84 to 3.63, N = 13,252, 2 trials, random-effects, <LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>). The quality of the evidence was assessed as moderate (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>). The data on cerebral palsy are heavily influenced by one small trial (<LINK REF="STD-Seattle-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Seattle 1987</LINK>) that randomised only very preterm babies (less than 32 weeks) and assessed outcomes for 173 babies of birthweight less than 1750 g with a cerebral palsy rate of 19.5% in the CTG group compared with 7.7% in the controls (RR 2.54, 95% CI 1.10 to 5.86). The other trial in this comparison (<LINK REF="STD-Dublin-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Dublin 1985</LINK>) showed no significant difference in the incidence of cerebral palsy (RR 1.20, 95% CI 0.52 to 2.79, N = 13,079) with a cerebral palsy rate of 0.18% in the continuous CTG group and 0.15% in the intermittently monitored group.</P>
<P>There was no difference in the incidence of cord blood acidosis between the groups (<LINK REF="CMP-001.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.6</LINK>). The quality of the evidence was assessed as very low, mainly due to very significant heterogeneity and design limitations in many of the included studies (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">For the mother</HEADING>
<P>There was a significant increase in the caesarean section rate in the CTG group (average RR 1.63, 95% CI 1.29 to 2.07, 18,861, 11 trials, <LINK REF="CMP-001.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.4</LINK>). However, the quality of this evidence was assessed as low, mainly due to very significant heterogeneity and study design limitations (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>). Risk difference in the caesarean section rate was 5% (95% CI 2% to 8%), with two-thirds of data coming from <LINK REF="STD-Dublin-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Dublin 1985</LINK>, where the overall caesarean section rate was 2.3%. In addition, the funnel plot indicated the possibility of missing studies (<LINK REF="FIG-04" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 4</LINK>).</P>
<P>Although numbers needed to treat to benefit or harm (NNTB/NNTH) analyses remain controversial in the context of meta-analysis and should be interpreted with caution, we calculated that there would be one additional caesarean section for every 44 women monitored continuously (95% CI 26 to 96). This calculation was based on the pooled caesarean section rate of 3.6% (337/9313) in the intermittent auscultation group from this meta-analysis. However, in most settings caesarean section rates are likely to be much higher. Assuming a caesarean section rate with intermittent auscultation of around 15%, there would be an additional caesarean section for every 11 women monitored (95% CI 7 to 23).</P>
<P>Continuous CTG was also associated with an increase in instrumental vaginal birth (<LINK REF="CMP-001.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.5</LINK>). The funnel plot indicated that some studies might be missing (<LINK REF="FIG-05" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 5</LINK>). The quality of this evidence was assessed as low, mainly due to very significant heterogeneity and study design limitations (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>). There was no difference identified in the use of any pharmacological analgesia (<LINK REF="CMP-001.07" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.7</LINK>), with the quality of the evidence assessed as low (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Overall findings</HEADING>
<P>Notwithstanding the caution regarding NNTB/NNTH calculations, when the risk of neonatal seizures is around 3 per 1000, 667 women would have to be continuously monitored during labour to prevent one such seizure (95% CI 484 to 1667). There is an opposite effect on caesarean section. Assuming a 3.6% caesarean section rate with intermittent auscultation, there would be 15 more caesarean sections in this cohort associated with preventing one neonatal seizure. However, if caesarean section with intermittent auscultation is higher (15%), 61 extra caesarean sections would be associated with preventing one neonatal seizure.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-01-25 10:34:14 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The main reason for the introduction of continuous intrapartum cardiotocography (CTG) monitoring in clinical practice was a belief that it would reduce rare but devastating outcomes - perinatal death and neonatal hypoxic brain injury - in otherwise healthy babies. However, we found no clear difference in perinatal deaths between pregnancies monitored during labour with continuous CTG compared to those monitored using intermittent auscultation. The overall quality of evidence that underpins this conclusion has been judged as moderate (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>). It does, however, seem unrealistic to expect that any randomised study of intrapartum interventions in modern maternity care will result in an improvement in perinatal deaths that reaches the conventional level of statistical significance (superiority). For a trial to test a realistic hypothesis that continuous CTG can prevent one death in one thousand births (0.1%), more than 50,000 women would have to be randomised. Therefore, it is more logical to concentrate on short- and long-term childhood morbidity. Unfortunately, very few clinically-relevant neonatal outcomes have been reported consistently in all trials.</P>
<P>For decades, low Apgar scores have been used as a surrogate measure for birth asphyxia and subsequent adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes. Recent evidence has confirmed a strong association between low Apgar score (at five minutes after birth) and cerebral palsy in both low and normal birthweight infants (<LINK REF="REF-Lie-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lie 2010</LINK>). We found no evidence that use of continuous intrapartum CTG monitoring has an impact on Apgar score. However, there were very few babies with clinically significant low Apgar scores in studies that assessed this outcome. Therefore, potentially important differences between the groups cannot be ruled out.</P>
<P>Hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy, a more robust measure of hypoxic brain injury, was reported in only one study (<LINK REF="STD-Athens-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Athens 1993</LINK>). In the absence of any meaningful long-term follow-up data, the impact of continuous CTG monitoring on a neonate can only be evaluated based on data from two clinically important outcomes, that is, neonatal seizures and cerebral palsy.</P>
<P>For both neonatal seizures and cerebral palsy, most data were provided by <LINK REF="STD-Dublin-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Dublin 1985</LINK>. At first glance, the data appear contradictory. There was a significant reduction in neonatal seizures in the continuous CTG group, but no impact on cerebral palsy. If anything, the rates of cerebral palsy appear to be higher in the continuous CTG group, although the pooled result did not reach statistical significance. This apparent increase in cerebral palsy in children monitored by CTG comes from <LINK REF="STD-Seattle-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Seattle 1987</LINK>. However, the results from this study, the only study of CTG monitoring during preterm labour, are not significant using 99% confidence intervals. In addition, this study excluded infants with birthweights of more than 1750 g (34% of randomised cohort), which may be a source of bias. Given that all other outcomes in this trial, including caesarean section rates, neonatal seizures and deaths were almost identical, this may have been a chance finding and should be interpreted with caution.</P>
<P>It is now generally accepted that cerebral palsy is more often caused by antepartum, rather than intrapartum, events (<LINK REF="REF-Palmer-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Palmer 1995</LINK>). Therefore, it may be unrealistic to expect that intrapartum interventions will have the capacity to achieve a significant reduction in cerebral palsy. There are, clearly, some cases of cerebral palsy that are a direct consequence of intrapartum hypoxic injury. These cases are very rare, and systematic reviews of randomised trials are unlikely to have sufficient power to test intrapartum CTG as a method to reduce cerebral palsy caused by acute and avoidable intrapartum events.</P>
<P>The reduction in seizures associated with continuous CTG monitoring is important, but must be interpreted cautiously in the absence of good quality long-term follow-up data. It has been suggested that seizures may be a "sentinel event" of a peripartum adversity that does not necessarily always manifest itself as hypoxic encephalopathy (<LINK REF="REF-Dennis-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dennis 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Derham-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Derham 1985</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Keegan-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Keegan 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lien-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lien 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Spellacy-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spellacy 1985</LINK>). When asphyxia, infection, brain malformations and metabolic causes are excluded, some neonatal seizures are associated with cerebral infarction or neonatal stroke (<LINK REF="REF-Estan-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Estan 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lien-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lien 1995</LINK>). Although the underlying causes are not well understood, neonatal seizures may have long-term consequences other than cerebral palsy. One longitudinal study found that some babies who had neonatal seizures were classified as normal at five years and had normal overall intelligence in adolescence as assessed by IQ tests, but had some abnormal results on detailed neuropsychological testing (<LINK REF="REF-Temple-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Temple 1995</LINK>). Clearly, there is a need for comprehensive long-term follow-up of the randomised cohorts that is not limited to extreme adverse outcomes such as cerebral palsy, but also includes more subtle neuropsychological assessment.</P>
<P>The results of this review demonstrate that continuous CTG monitoring leads to an increase in caesarean sections. Such an effect of continuous CTG is clinically plausible because CTG monitoring leads to more interventions (e.g. fetal blood sampling, amniotomy) and more diagnoses of presumed fetal compromise for which emergency caesarean section is seen as the only safe management option. However, the overall quality of evidence for this outcome was judged as low (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>). Therefore, the observed increase must be interpreted cautiously.</P>
<P>It is noteworthy that size and direction of the effect on caesarean section was consistent for prespecified subgroups, including high-quality trials and trials where clinicians had access to intrapartum fetal blood sampling. Subgroup interaction test was only significant (I = 81.6%) for studies in low-risk, high-risk and mixed risk status, but heterogeneity came from a mixed group. The impact of CTG monitoring on caesarean section in low-risk and high-risk populations appears to be virtually identical, which is contrary to recommendations from many professional bodies providing guidance on intrapartum fetal monitoring.</P>
<P>There was some evidence that labour was more painful in the continuous CTG group, but the statistically significant increase in the need for any analgesia included general anaesthesia. Therefore, it is likely that this difference was caused by an increase in the number of caesarean sections, rather than necessarily more painful labour. Women report more pain when lying on their backs during labour. At the times when the studies in this review were undertaken (between 1976 and 1994), women in the intermittent auscultation group may well also have been on their backs and not using mobility and positions to help them with their labours. There were no data from the trials included in the review to enable analysis of this potential confounder.</P>
<P>We prespecified several subgroups that could have been expected to influence the direction and size of the differences compared with results when all trials were considered together. We were conscious that any differences among subgroups and overall results would have to be interpreted with extreme caution (<LINK REF="REF-Rothwell-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rothwell 2005</LINK>). With this proviso, we found no subgroup differences of clinical importance, but the number of trials and women in subgroups was relatively small.</P>

<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2017-01-17 11:57:47 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Ann Jones">
<P>Clearly, the lack of long-term follow-up data and inadequate reporting of the data according to the clinically important subgroups is regrettable and limits the applicability of the evidence.</P>
<P>There are also two other issues that should be considered in the applicability of the evidence reviewed here:</P>
<OL>
<LI>Methods of intermittent ascultation differed among included trials regarding frequency, duration and timing in relation to contractions; some recorded fetal heartbeat during and after contractions, others immediately following contractions, and others were not specific (<LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK>). The trials also differed in additional assessments of fetal wellbeing. For example, in <LINK REF="STD-Dublin-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Dublin 1985</LINK>, which is a large contributor of meta-analysis weight across most review outcomes, all women had an artifical rupture of membranes performed within an hour of admission. In addition to routine artifical rupture of membranes, in <LINK REF="STD-Dublin-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Dublin 1985</LINK> fetal blood sampling was performed for all women who had not delivered within eight hours (1.2% of women in the CTG group and 2.1% of women in the intermittent auscultation group). Such practices may be less generalisable to current approaches to care of women during labour.</LI>
<LI>With the exception of <LINK REF="STD-New-Delhi-2006" TYPE="STUDY">New Delhi 2006</LINK>, all included studies were conducted in the 1970s, 1980s, and early 1990s. Since then, there have been substantial developments in equipment used to perform cardiotocography and a strong emphasis on education for all those involved in CTG interpretation (which in some jurisdictions is mandatory), and continuous review and refinement of interpretation criteria. Nevertheless, most technological developments in intrapartum assessment of fetal wellbeing, including for example, ST waveform analysis (<LINK REF="REF-Neilson-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Neilson 2015</LINK>), expert systems (<LINK REF="REF-Lutomski-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lutomski 2015</LINK>) and computerised analysis have not shown substantive clinical benefits. In addition, there was insufficient evidence available to demonstrate a substantial benefit for applied artificial intelligence, such as expert systems, in improving interpretation of fetal heart rate tracings (<LINK REF="REF-Lutomski-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lutomski 2015</LINK>). This might suggest that the data related to the impact of CTG monitoring is still relevant to current practice.</LI>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2017-01-17 11:31:40 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Ann Jones">
<P>Translating the evidence from this review into clinical practice poses significant challenges. One would hope that the quality of cardiotocography (CTG) equipment, interpretation and training have improved over the years making the external validity of much of the data included in this review questionable.</P>
<P>In most included studies, intermittent auscultation was carried out according to the strict protocols in hospital settings with quick recourse to continuous monitoring and intervention if required. In some trials, most notably <LINK REF="STD-Dublin-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Dublin 1985</LINK>, intact fetal membranes were ruptured at the earliest opportunity to confirm absence of meconium, and women had one-to-one care from a midwife. This monitoring package differs significantly from practices in some modern birth settings (including, for example, stand-alone midwifery units) where artificial rupture of membranes is avoided as long as possible, and where mobilisation and normality are promoted. In addition, one-to-one care by a midwife, or a nurse-midwife, seems hard to implement in many healthcare settings and is likely to be an important contributory factor for effectiveness (or lack of it) of both types of fetal heart rate monitoring.</P>
<P>With this proviso, women should be informed that continuous CTG during labour is associated with a reduction in the incidence of neonatal seizures, has no obvious impact on cerebral palsy or perinatal mortality, but is associated with an increase in the incidence of caesarean section and instrumental vaginal births. The adverse affects of operative births are well described, albeit that longer term morbidity data are less available than shorter term morbidity data. The possible long-term effects of preventable neonatal seizures remain unknown. Women also need to be informed of the loss of mobility associated with the use of continuous CTG in labour.</P>
<P>Women, practitioners and policy makers need to carefully consider the absence of evidence that continuous CTG monitoring has a different impact on caesarean section and neonatal seizures in low- and high-risk populations and that there is an absence of evidence from included trials of a beneficial effect for fetal blood sampling.</P>
<P>The risk-benefit debate will continue to focus on caesarean section and neonatal seizures. Given the perceived conflict between the risk for the mother (increased caesarean section and instrumental vaginal delivery rate) and benefit for the baby (decreased incidence of neonatal seizures), it is difficult to make quality judgments about which effect is more important. The issue of effectiveness is particularly important. CTG advocates will continue to argue that lack of clear long-term benefit for the child is not proof that intermittent auscultation is safe. However, it would seem reasonable to base clinical decisions on the evidence we currently have rather than on unknown risks of unknown quantity. Obviously, the risk-benefit assessment will vary among individuals, policy makers and healthcare settings. The real challenge is how best to convey this uncertainty to women and help them to make informed choices without compromising the normality of labour.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2017-01-17 08:13:26 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Ann Jones">
<P>A question remains about whether future randomised trials should measure efficacy (the intrinsic value of continuous CTG in trying to prevent adverse neonatal outcomes under optimal clinical conditions) or effectiveness (the effect of this technique in routine clinical practice).</P>
<P>Along with the need for further investigations into the long-term effects of operative births for women and babies, much remains to be learned about the causation and possible links between antenatal or intrapartum events, neonatal seizures and long-term neurodevelopmental outcome, bearing in mind the changes in clinical practice over the intervening years (one-to-one-support during labour, caesarean section rates). The large number of babies randomised in this review will now have reached adulthood, and could potentially provide us with a unique opportunity to clarify if a reduction in neonatal seizures is something inconsequential that should not greatly influence women's and clinicians' choices, or if seizure reduction leads to long-term benefits for babies. Defining meaningful neurological and behavioural outcomes that could be measured in large cohorts of young adults poses huge challenges.</P>
<P>Data should also be collected from this cohort of women and babies, while medical records still exist, to describe, where possible, the women's mobility and positions during labour and birth, and clarify if these might impact on outcomes. Research should also investigate the possible contribution of the supine position to adverse outcomes for the baby, and address the question of whether the use of mobility and positions can reduce the already low incidence of neonatal seizures and improve psychological outcomes for women.</P>

<P>Zarko Alfirevic (ZA) is Director of Harris Wellbeing Preterm Birth Centre which is grant funded by the charity Wellbeing of Women. This grant is administered by University of Liverpool and Zarko Alfirevic is not paid directly. He is the principal investigator or co-investigator on several grants from public funders including National Institute of Health Research, British Medical Association, European Commission and WHO. He has received research support in the past from Perkin Elmer and Alere for research related to pre-eclampsia and preterm birth prevention. These grants were administered by his employers and ZA did not benefit directly. ZA is also a Co-coordinating Editor of Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth.</P>
<P>Declan Devane has conducted a trial, known as the ADCAR Trial, evaluating the effectiveness of the admission cardiotocograph (CTG) compared with intermittent auscultation. This study is funded by the Health Research Board (Ireland). If this trial is eligible for inclusion in the full review, or a subsequent review update, the investigators will not be involved in assessing the trial for inclusion, assessing risk of bias, or data extraction. These tasks will be carried out by two other members of the review team who are not directly involved with the ADCAR Trial. Declan Devane has acted as an expert midwifery witness in legal cases centred around aspects of fetal monitoring and has been paid for same. Declan provides and has been paid to deliver fetal monitoring education programmes, which are organised by a commercial company (Cardiac Service) who provide, among other products, CTG machines.

<P>Fetal stethoscope (Pinard) - for intermittent monitoring (IA)</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>This is a trumpet-shaped device, which is placed on the mother's abdomen and the caregiver listens for the heart beat at the other end. This is a simple instrument of relatively low cost</P>
</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>
<P>Hand-held Doppler ultrasound monitor - for intermittent monitoring (IA)</P>
</TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">
<P>The device is placed on the mother's abdomen with gel smeared on the underside of the ultrasound transducer. This allows the ultrasound beam to travel from the fetal heart to the transducer without interruption</P>
</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">
<P>External cardiotocography - for continuous or intermittent monitoring</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>The fetal heart rate and the activity of the uterine muscle are detected by two transducers placed on the mother's abdomen (one above the fetal heart and the other at the fundus). Doppler ultrasound provides the information which is recorded on a paper strip known as a cardiotocograph (CTG).</P>
</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">
<P>Internal cardiotocography - for continuous monitoring</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>An electrode is placed directly on the baby's presenting part to detect the fetal ECG signal. Again the signals are recorded on a paper strip (CTG). This method can only be used if membranes (fore-waters) have ruptured either spontaneously or artificially</P>

<P>In this review you comment on the significant reduction in neonatal seizures associated with continuous cardiotocography rather than intermittent auscultation, but then put this in opposition to the increase in caesarean section. Yet, more caesarean sections are performed without clinical indication, on maternal `request' than are performed for threatening fetal hypoxia. Moreover, you stress that continuous cardiotocography is not associated with any beneficial effect on the risk of cerebral palsy, because 80%-85% of cases have an antenatal origin and therefore intrapartum CTG can not be expected to have a great impact on the overall figure.</P>
<P>A recent Swedish study (<LINK REF="REF-Lindstr_x00f6_m-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lindstrm 2006</LINK>) reported outcome at 15-19 years of age after moderate hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy (Sarnat II with neonatal seizures in most cases). Of 43 children with moderate hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy, 15 had cerebral palsy. Of the 28 children without encephalopathy, 20 had cognitive problems. Only 8 of the 43 children had no problem later in life. So, a halving in neonatal seizures with continuous cardiotocography seems to me, as an old obstetrician, to be a very good outcome.</P>

<P>Thank you for your comments. In our review, we feel we have clearly articulated the perceived conflict between our findings of increased caesarean section and instrumental vaginal birth and decreased incidence of neonatal seizures associated with continuous CTG when compared with intermittent auscultation.</P>
<P>We are unaware of any high quality evidence that demonstrates a higher rate of caesarean sections due to maternal &#8216;request&#8217; than due to hypoxia. Caesarean sections for maternal &#8216;request&#8217; is a complex issue and there are those who have argued that it is not a significant influencing factor on caesarean rates (<LINK REF="REF-Gamble-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gamble 2007</LINK>) Even if such evidence existed, we believe that this is addressing a different question from that in our review.</P>
<P>The focus of the quoted study by Lindstrm et al (<LINK REF="REF-Lindstr_x00f6_m-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lindstrm 2006</LINK>) is on neonatal encephalopathy. In our review, we highlighted that much remains to be learned about the causation and possible links between antenatal or intrapartum events, neonatal seizures and long-term neurodevelopmental outcome. For this reason we believe it reasonable to base clinical decisions on the evidence we currently have.</P>

<FEEDBACK_SUMMARY MODIFIED="2017-01-17 08:01:01 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Ann Jones">
<P>I have two comments about this review:</P>
<P>1) In the continuously monitored group the relative risk of perinatal mortality is lower rather than in the intermittently monitored group (RR 0.86). This result may be important for women when they choose which method of fetal monitoring to adopt during labour. Is it not more useful to present the absolute and relative risk, so the woman, her midwife and doctor can decide if these are significant to them or not? To consider a result significant only if it is statistically significant (and only if statistically significant at a given level of significance, such as 5%) is an arbitrary decision that needs to be shared with the woman and her clinical team.</P>
<P>2) An interesting question raised by this review is which method of intermittent auscultation is best. The review lumps together different types of intermittent auscultation; for example, auscultation during and after a contraction, and auscultation only after a contraction.</P>
<P>The review assesses the relationship between pH at birth and the method of foetal heart monitoring rate (intermittent or continuous) in two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Athens-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Athens 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dublin-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Dublin 1985</LINK>), and does not find any difference between the two methods as regards neonatal pH at birth. It is interesting to note that in the Dublin trial, which used intermittent auscultation only after a contraction, the pH at birth was worse for woman allocated intermittent auscultation rather than continuous monitoring (RR 0.45, 95% CI 0.16 - 1.29). In contrast, in the Athens trial, which used intermittent auscultation during and after the contraction, pH at birth was better for woman allocated intermittent auscultation (RR 1.58, 95% CI 0.89 - 2.81).</P>
<P>The importance of decelerations during the contraction and their impact on foetal wellbeing is now well known. Therefore the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) (1) considers monitoring to be reassuring only if there are no decelerations. Some guidelines advise monitoring the foetal heart after a contraction (2), others during and after (3), and others again do not specify the timing of auscultation in relation to contraction (4). The review is appropriate in not drawing any conclusions about what is the best method of intermittent monitoring. We think that guidelines should state both that the mode of intermittent monitoring and the choice of one method rather than another is a grade C recommendation (personal opinion) (5) as, in the light of this review, we do not know which method of intermittent monitoring is best (although we could suppose that intermittent auscultation during and after a contraction may be better than auscultation only after a contraction for preventing low pH at birth).</P>

<P>1) We agree that the concept of statistical significance arbitrary and therefore needs to be shared with the woman and her clinical team as such. However, focusing on point estimates of relative or absolute risk reduction is not a solution. Whilst it is correct that the relative risk for perinatal mortality is 0.86, the 95% confidence intervals suggests that use of cardiotocography is compatible with much higher risk reduction (41%), but also with an increase in perinatal mortality (up to 23%). For this reason, we concluded that the observed difference in perinatal death is not significant, both clinical and statistical terms.</P>
<P>2) We agree that the issue of generaliziblity (external validity) of the data from this review is important not just for cardiotocography, but also for intermittent auscultation (IA). The protocols for IA, training and monitoring of adherence varied considerably in the studies and in clinical practice world wide, We have added <LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK> to highlight this issue and discussed further in the section <LINK TAG="APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS" TYPE="SECTION">Overall completeness and applicability of evidence</LINK>.</P>
