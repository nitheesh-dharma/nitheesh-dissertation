<P>
<B>Review question</B>
</P>
<P>This review aims to see whether respite care can reduce caregiver burden and stress, and increase the length of time for which a person with dementia can continue living at home.</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>Caring for someone with dementia can be emotionally and physically demanding. Respite care is any intervention designed to give rest or relief to caregivers and it is not clear what positive and negative effects such care may have on them, or on people with dementia.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>Four studies with 753 participants were included in this review. Three compared respite care to no respite care and one compared respite care to polarity therapy, a type of touch therapy. All studies included people with dementia and their caregivers. We were not able to pool the results of the studies as there were so few studies and they measured the outcomes in different ways. All the studies reported outcomes for the caregiver, but only one reported outcomes for the person with dementia.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>The three studies that compared respite care to no respite care found no evidence of any benefit of respite care for people with dementia or for their caregivers for any outcome, including rates of institutionalisation and caregiver burden. The study that compared respite care to polarity therapy found that polarity therapy decreased caregiver perceived stress but that there was no difference between polarity therapy and respite care for other measures of psychological health and other caregiver outcomes.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
</P>
<P>A host of methodological problems were identified in the available trials. One study did not report data that could be analysed, the remaining three studies were very small and had a very short duration. Further methodologically sound research is needed before any firm conclusions can be drawn.</P>

<P>Two review authors carried out study selection independently and reached a consensus through discussion. Data were extracted by a single review author.

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-01-11 11:54:14 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Four trials are now included in the review, with 753 participants. They were different in many ways including the intervention, duration, outcomes and control group so pooling of data was not possible. Overall, the quality of the evidence was rated as very low. Re-analysis of outcomes using data from the published studies found no significant effects of respite care compared to no respite care on any caregiver variable. When respite care was compared to polarity therapy a significant effect was found in favour of polarity therapy for caregiver perceived stress (n = 38, MD 5.80, 95% CI 1.43 to 10.17), but not for other measures of psychological health and other caregiver outcomes. No studies reported evaluable data on outcomes related to the people with dementia.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2014-01-11 11:55:01 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Current evidence does not demonstrate any benefits or adverse effects from the use of respite care for people with dementia or their caregivers. These results should be treated with caution, however, as they may reflect the lack of high quality research in this area rather than an actual lack of benefit. Given the frequency with which respite care is advocated and provided, well-designed trials are needed in this area.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2014-01-12 06:33:22 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2014-01-12 06:09:22 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Dementia is a common and serious mental health problem affecting 6.4% of the population. It increases in prevalence with age, from 0.8% in 65 to 69 year olds to 28.5% in people aged 90 years or older (<LINK REF="REF-Lobo-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lobo 2000</LINK>). In the coming years an exponential increase in numbers of people who are affected is anticipated as populations age (<LINK REF="REF-Mura-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mura 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>The clinical features of dementia include an acquired global impairment of intellect and memory; there may be changes in personality and most cases of dementia result in progressive impairment of language, insight and judgement (<LINK REF="REF-APA-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">APA 1994</LINK>). Most affected individuals demonstrate difficulties with executive functions and later develop difficulties with activities of daily living. As a result of these impairments, people with dementia require assistance with many aspects of their lives and progressively more care over time. Such care is initially provided by family members (<LINK REF="REF-Karlawish-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Karlawish 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shaji-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shaji 2003</LINK>). Because of the long duration and increasing severity of their disorder, people with dementia may be institutionalised.</P>
<P>Remaining in the community is generally preferable for people with dementia (<LINK REF="REF-Levin-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Levin 1994</LINK>), who may remain more socially connected, have better physical functions and experience higher levels of quality of life (<LINK REF="REF-Nikmat-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nikmat 2013</LINK>) and, when not overly demanding, can be emotionally satisfying and rewarding for caregivers. In some systems of health and social care delaying institutionalisation can also reduce costs to the system (<LINK REF="REF-Johnson-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnson 2000</LINK>). Providing care for a person with dementia in the community commonly places stress on the primary caregiver (<LINK REF="REF-Brodaty-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brodaty 2009</LINK>). The stress can have many causes including the need to be available to the person with dementia at all times as well as problems with communication and behaviour associated with the dementia. It is reported that the primary sources of strain to caregivers of people with dementia are the behavioural problems and incontinence (<LINK REF="STD-Grant-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Grant 2003</LINK>). The stress of caring can also be exacerbated by lack of a supportive response from local health and social services, and by lack of support and sometimes criticism from other family members (<LINK REF="REF-Shaji-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shaji 2003</LINK>). Such stress can have a range of adverse effects including the breakdown of the relationship between patient and caregiver, a poorer quality of care, and physical and psychological morbidity for both the patient and caregiver (<LINK REF="REF-Neufield-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Neufield 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Parks-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parks 2000</LINK>). In extreme cases, violence and other forms of abuse may be precipitated.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2014-01-12 06:14:34 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In an attempt to prolong the time that people with dementia can remain in the community, respite care has been advocated. Respite care is the temporary provision of care for a person with dementia, at home or in an institution, by people other than the primary caregiver. Respite care is a blanket term used to describe a very diverse set of services which vary over a number of dimensions. The first of these dimensions is place; respite care can take place in the home of the person with dementia, a daycare centre or a residential setting. Respite care can also vary in terms of who provides the care; this may be by trained and untrained staff or volunteers. The care provided may also differ in duration, ranging from a couple of hours to a number of weeks. Respite care may be planned or unplanned and may involve overnight care or daytime-only care. Ideally the patient and caregiver should be able to choose the type of respite care that suits them, but in reality often only one type of care is available in any one geographical area.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2014-01-12 06:18:43 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The temporary provision of care is to give primary caregivers respite from their caregiving responsibilities and hopefully ameliorate, to some degree, the stresses associated with being a caregiver. The provision of respite care is based on the assumption that the reduction in the stress of the caregiver produced by a temporary relief from caregiving will allow the person with dementia to remain in the community for longer, to have a better relationship with his or her caregiver, and to receive better care while in the community. In an ideal situation, the periods of respite can also be used to offer professional re-evaluation of the needs of a person with dementia and to provide rehabilitation.</P>
<P>The different types of respite care are so diverse that they are likely to vary in the extent to which they are useful to what is an equally diverse set of users. People with dementia and their caregivers vary in many factors including age, sex, severity of disease, employment status, education, socioeconomic status and physical health. All of these factors could be expected to impact on the type of respite care that may be most desirable and efficacious for any particular person with dementia and their carer.</P>
<P>Increased availability and flexibility of respite care are very common requests in surveys of caregivers (<LINK REF="REF-Levin-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Levin 1994</LINK>). Thus we can assume that caregivers value respite services. Many users report that they would not be able to cope without such support (<LINK REF="REF-Levin-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Levin 1994</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2014-01-12 06:33:22 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Although respite care is advocated by many and has a rational basis, its efficacy has been called into question, particularly because when offered respite care only "slightly over half of caregivers" avail themselves of this service (<LINK REF="STD-Lawton-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Lawton 1989</LINK>). Publications suggest that the limited use of respite care may arise because most families cope reasonably well with the demands of caregiving and therefore do not need this service. Many caregivers may be using informal types of respite care such as help from family and friends. Alternatively, caregivers may think, rightly or wrongly, that respite care has adverse consequences which outweigh its benefits. Reports have found that caregivers regard respite care as providing benefits of self-care and relief to themselves at the cost of the safety and comfort of their family members during the respite care episodes; they feel torn between the necessity to have a break and their anxiety about the impact of institutional respite care on the person with dementia (<LINK REF="REF-Gilmour-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gilmour 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Perry-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Perry 2001</LINK>). Other perceived adverse effects of respite care are the disruption in routine (<LINK REF="REF-Hirsch-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hirsch 1993</LINK>) and the feelings of guilt, despondency, being 'let-down' or emotional devastation some caregivers experience when a respite care period ends (<LINK REF="REF-Strang-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Strang 2000</LINK>). A further possibility is that the type of respite care preferred by the caregiver is not available in their area of residence, implying that it is not respite care in general but the mode of service delivery the efficacy of which may be being questioned. This explanation would fit in with the earlier observation that respite care is a much requested service.</P>
<P>Respite care services are advocated by health and social care providers from a wide range of backgrounds and have been provided for over 20 years around the world. In addition, numerous publications evaluate the effects of respite care (<LINK REF="REF-Gottlieb-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gottlieb 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lawton-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Lawton 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zarit-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Zarit 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zarit-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zarit 1999</LINK>) and have given rise to reviews of caregiver interventions in general and one concerning daycare programmes alone. These papers have focused on outcomes for the caregiver. A systematic review of the literature and data which specifically assess the benefits and adverse effects of respite care on the quality of life, morbidity or mortality of people with dementia and their caregivers has not been published.</P>

<P>NM undertook assessment of the risk of bias of all the included trials according to the methods in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>) and KSW checked these.</P>
<P>The risk of bias tool examines five key domains for bias: selection bias, performance bias, attrition bias, detection bias and reporting bias. We assessed each domain and classified it as either at low or a high risk of bias and where insufficient detail was reported in a study to assess the risk we reported this as 'unclear'. In addition, we reported any other forms of bias noted in the studies.</P>

<P>For continuous outcomes we collected the mean change from baseline, the standard deviation of the mean change, and the number of patients for each treatment group at each assessment. The baseline assessment was defined as the latest available assessment preceding randomisation, but no longer than two months before.</P>
<P>Where changes from baseline were not reported, we extracted the endpoint mean and standard deviation at each time point. We estimated the mean difference (MD) between groups and its 95% confidence interval (CI).</P>
<P>For binary data we sought the numbers in each treatment group and the numbers experiencing the outcome of interest, and calculated a standard estimation of the risk ratio (RR) and its 95% CI.

<UNIT_OF_ANALYSIS MODIFIED="2014-01-12 10:43:01 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The outcomes measured in clinical trials of dementia and cognitive impairment often arise from ordinal rating scales. Where the rating scales used in the trials had a reasonably large number of categories (more than 10) we treated the data as continuous outcomes arising from normal distributions. Summary statistics (n, mean and standard deviation) were required for each rating scale at each assessment time for each treatment group in each trial for the change from baseline.</P>
<P>When changes from baseline results were not reported, we calculated the required summary statistics from the baseline and assessment time treatment group means and standard deviations. In this case a zero correlation between the measurements at baseline and assessment time was assumed. This method overestimates the standard deviation of the change from baseline, but this conservative approach is considered to be preferable in a meta-analysis.</P>
<P>One trial apparently used clustering but did not report enough information for us to be sure and the data were not reported in a usable form. If cluster studies had been appropriately analysed taking into account intra-class correlation coefficients and the relevant data documented in the report, synthesis with other studies would have been possible using the generic inverse variance technique.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">4. Participants</HEADING>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Grant-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Grant 2003</LINK>: the participants were 55 people with probable Alzheimer's disease and their spousal caregivers. Diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease was established through neurological and neuropsychological tests or from an existing diagnosis made by a physician. Baseline information about the people with dementia was limited to a Clinical Dementia Rating: 38% were classified as mild, 44% as moderate and 18% as severe. The caregivers were stratified into two groups according to criteria developed by the investigators, vulnerable and non-vulnerable. The vulnerable classification was made in those persons who provided more than 12 hours of care per day and who had received in-home respite care less than once per month in the six months preceding the baseline. Non-vulnerable caregivers were those who received more respite care than this, although those who received more than eight hours per week were not considered for the study. Caregivers all lived with the person with dementia. There were 21 male and 34 female caregivers.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Korn-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Korn 2009</LINK>: the participants were 42 American Indians or Alaskan natives who were caregivers of family members with dementia. The mean age of the caregivers was 50 years, ranging from 27 to 69 years, and there were 38 women and 4 men. The care recipients' age ranged from 32 to 89 years and 57% were 70 years and older. The two care recipients who were younger than 35 years were diagnosed with dementia due to a stroke and to the sequelae of a failed suicide attempt.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Lawton-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Lawton 1989</LINK>: the participants were 632 people with dementia and their caregivers. Eligibility criteria were that the caregiver took primary responsibility for the care of the patient who was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease or a related disorder by a physician. This diagnosis was confirmed using the Mental Status Questionnaire (<LINK REF="REF-Kahn-1961" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kahn 1961</LINK>). The average age of the care recipients was 76.2 years and of the caregivers it was 59.9 years; 377 people with dementia were female and 255 were male. There were 501 female and 131 male caregivers.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Wishart-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Wishart 2000</LINK>: the participants were 24 people with dementia who were living in the community and their caregivers. Demographic information was not fully reported but the mean ages of the participants for whom the data were available were 80.2 and 57.6 years for the care recipients and caregivers respectively. Correspondence with the author revealed that the diagnosis of dementia was an existing diagnosis made by a physician. Sixteen care recipients were female and 4 were male. There were 18 female and 3 male caregivers.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">5. Interventions</HEADING>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Grant-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Grant 2003</LINK>: the intervention group were entitled to up to 60 hours of respite care over a two-week period. The respite intervention was care of the person with dementia in the home of the caregiver and person with dementia, provided by professionals who were trained in the care of people with Alzheimer's disease. Respite care could total no more than six hours per day. The actual amount of respite care used was up to the discretion of the caregiver. Members of the control group were given no respite care.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Korn-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Korn 2009</LINK>: the respite intervention provided a trained companion to stay at home with the care recipient for eight sessions, and lasted for three hours. The caregivers were encouraged to participate in activities and were given transportation, admission costs and supplies for the activities they chose, which included music therapy, yoga, swimming and basket-making, activities with friends and gardening, and lasted between 60 to 120 minutes. The control group were given polarity therapy, a type of touch therapy that uses gentle pressure on energy points and biofields to help the client achieve physiological relaxation. They were provided with eight 50-minute sessions, and care recipients also received three hours of trained care to allow for travel to and from the therapy.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Lawton-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Lawton 1989</LINK>: experimental participants were given access to three types of respite care, in-home respite, daycare or institutional respite. The different forms were not mutually exclusive as participants were eligible to use any of the different forms in any combination. Funding for the respite care was provided as needed. This meant that those caregivers able to pay for the respite care did so, and those that could not were given a subsidy by the respite programme, government or other organisation. The duration of the intervention was one year. Those in the control group were not given access to respite care but were given a list of services available for those with dementia and their families.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Wishart-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Wishart 2000</LINK>: the respite intervention consisted of a weekly visit by a trained volunteer who provided assistance and companionship to the care recipient through a visiting or walking programme, so relieving the caregiver. The visits lasted an average of 2.5 hours and the intervention was provided for six weeks. Those randomised to the control group received no visits but were given the intervention after the study had finished and so constituted a waiting list control.</P>

<P>No double blinding was reported in any of the studies. Blinding is virtually impossible with this type of intervention for the participants and the experimenters. However, it is feasible for those who are measuring outcomes to be blind to treatment allocation. Lack of blinding in this type of study diminishes the methodological quality due to the possibility that the researchers' or participants' preconceptions about the efficacy of respite care may result in bias when performing the assessments. All studies were rated as unclear for blinding of participants; only <LINK REF="STD-Korn-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Korn 2009</LINK> reported that the outcome assessors were blinded and was rated as low risk, the remaining three trials were rated as at unclear risk of bias.</P>

These outcomes were Caregiver Burden (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>), Hamilton-Depression (<LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>), Hamilton Anxiety (<LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>), Global Severity Index from the Brief Symptom Inventory (<LINK REF="CMP-001.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.4</LINK>), Social Support-Affective Support (<LINK REF="CMP-001.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.5</LINK>) and Social Support-Confidant Support (<LINK REF="CMP-001.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.6</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Wishart-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Wishart 2000</LINK> reported a significant effect in favour of the respite group on caregiver burden; however, using the data reported in the paper we found a non-significant result.

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-01-12 11:38:57 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The aim of this review was to evaluate the benefits and adverse effects of respite care for people with dementia and their caregivers. See <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK> and <LINK REF="SOF-02" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 2</LINK>.</P>
<P>Analysis of the available data showed no significant effects on caregiver outcomes when respite care was compared with no respite care in three studies, and there was no evaluable data for people with dementia. When respite care was compared to polarity therapy, a type of touch therapy that uses gentle pressure on energy points and biofields to help the client achieve physiological relaxation, a significant treatment effect was found in favour of polarity therapy for caregiver perceived stress, however, other measures of psychological health and other outcomes showed no significant effects. Again, there were no evaluable data for people with dementia.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2014-01-12 11:55:05 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There are two possible explanations for these results, firstly, that in reality respite care has no effects on caregivers or, secondly, that any resultant effects are imperceptible due to the small sizes of the trials. In order to establish which of these is the case one must systematically assess the validity of the studies included in the review. There are three main issues to address here, the intervention, the people to whom the intervention was given and the outcomes of the intervention.</P>
<P>The interventions tested in the included studies were very different, although they all met our criteria for respite care by providing relief for the caregiver. The duration of the intervention for three of the trials was extremely short, consisting of two, six and eight weeks for <LINK REF="STD-Grant-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Grant 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Wishart-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Wishart 2000</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Korn-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Korn 2009</LINK>, respectively. Given the prolonged and degenerative course of the diseases that cause dementia, even the year-long study by Lawton and colleagues could be considered too short. The intensity of the intervention also varied between studies. Participants in the Wishart study were provided with respite care for only two hours per week, in <LINK REF="STD-Korn-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Korn 2009</LINK> they received three hours per week, while those in the <LINK REF="STD-Grant-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Grant 2003</LINK> trial had 10 days of care (up to six hours per day). The frequency and amount of respite provided in the <LINK REF="STD-Lawton-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Lawton 1989</LINK> study depended on how much care the caregiver both wanted and felt able to afford. To use an analogy coined by Zarit in his extensive writings on this subject, it is possible that the respite care given in these studies was at a subclinical dosage.</P>
<P>The actual respite care received was also qualitatively different. The intervention in both <LINK REF="STD-Grant-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Grant 2003</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Korn-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Korn 2009</LINK> was in-home respite only, <LINK REF="STD-Lawton-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Lawton 1989</LINK> allowed the choice between in-home, daycare and institutional respite, and in <LINK REF="STD-Wishart-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Wishart 2000</LINK> the person with dementia was taken from the home on a walk. Different kinds of respite care are likely to have very different effects on both the caregivers and recipients and may be used in very different ways. Daycare and in-home respite care are likely to be used on a regular basis whereas institutional care is likely to be used on a more infrequent basis, and can be planned or unplanned in the case of, for example, caregiver illness. In-home respite care is said to be the most requested service while out of home daycare may increase the workload for caregivers by requiring them to prepare and transport the person with dementia (<LINK REF="REF-Berry-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Berry 1991</LINK>). It is recommended that future studies evaluate a single type of respite care and that future reviews consider each type of respite care separately.</P>
<P>A problem specific to the <LINK REF="STD-Lawton-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Lawton 1989</LINK> study was that caregivers were only given the opportunity to purchase respite care and were not provided with it free-of-charge as with the other three studies, although it should be noted that there were means-tested subsidies available. This introduces a further confounding factor to the study as only those who were able to afford respite care may have used it. This may have partly explained the low utilization of the intervention on offer. A further criticism of the <LINK REF="STD-Lawton-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Lawton 1989</LINK> study is that on examination of the range of hours of in-home respite used by participants in the control group in the year preceding baseline, some caregiving dyads were receiving full-time in-home care. This shows that the definition of respite care as being a temporary relief for caregivers was confounded in this study.</P>
<P>The <LINK REF="STD-Korn-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Korn 2009</LINK> study compared respite care to a very specific alternative treatment, and only one of the four caregiver psychological health and stress outcomes were in favour of the alterative therapy, which could mean that either the trial was underpowered to find a difference on these outcomes or that respite care was equally as good as polarity therapy in improving the psychological and physical health of caregivers. It is unclear whether this trial has wider applicability as it was conducted in a very specific population, American Indians and Native Alaskans.</P>
<P>In terms of participants, the sample sizes in three of the studies were small. If an effect of respite care does exist it is likely to be small and may not be identified in studies of such limited size and quality. The samples of people with dementia were poorly defined, with none of the three included studies using any standard diagnostic tools. There was wide variation in the severity of cognitive impairment, which was likely to translate into a similarly large variation in the need for respite care. It has been shown that many caregivers do not make use of respite care early on in their relative's illness but wait until they have been caring for them for many years (<LINK REF="REF-Gottlieb-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gottlieb 2000</LINK>). If a large proportion of the sample were caring for a mildly impaired person then respite care might not have been expected to have a significant impact. Conversely, some researchers have suggested that not using respite care until the care recipients are severely impaired may mean that the caregivers are beyond help. Grant and colleagues split the caregivers in their sample into vulnerable and non-vulnerable subgroups according to the number of hours they spent on caregiving tasks on an average day and the amount of respite they had received in the preceding six months. It is probable that measurable differences in caregiver outcomes are more likely in vulnerable groups.</P>
<P>The relationships between the caregivers and those with dementia also differed among the studies. The caregivers in the <LINK REF="STD-Grant-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Grant 2003</LINK> study were all the spouses of those with dementia and in <LINK REF="STD-Korn-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Korn 2009</LINK> they were spouses and other family members. Caregivers in the <LINK REF="STD-Lawton-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Lawton 1989</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Wishart-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Wishart 2000</LINK> studies were enrolled irrespective of their relationship with the caregiver. Caregivers who are spouses of patients and those who care for their parents are said to have very different needs (<LINK REF="REF-Zarit-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zarit 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>The validity of any randomised controlled trial also depends on the choice of control intervention. <LINK REF="STD-Wishart-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Wishart 2000</LINK> used a wait-list control group. This type of control has been criticised because the participants in the control group know that they will receive the intervention at some time, and this may have an impact upon their psychological wellbeing (<LINK REF="REF-Basham-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Basham 1986</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Grant-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Grant 2003</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Lawton-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Lawton 1989</LINK> both used a no-treatment control. A problem with all of these designs is that the respite care provided as the intervention is not the only respite care available to the caregivers. Some caregivers in the control group of the <LINK REF="STD-Lawton-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Lawton 1989</LINK> study actually received more hours of respite care than those in the intervention group. This has been criticised in the literature as confounding the study (<LINK REF="REF-Gottlieb-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gottlieb 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zarit-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Zarit 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zarit-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zarit 1999</LINK>) but may rather suggest that the way in which respite care was offered in the study was not as effective as the ways in which caregivers located it independently. In this case one would be evaluating a service designed to deliver respite care rather than respite care per se. <LINK REF="STD-Korn-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Korn 2009</LINK> used respite care as the control, with participants engaging in a range of activities, and polarity therapy, a specific form of touch therapy, was the intervention. This is likely to have influenced the results and makes it difficult to compare the effects of respite care in this study with the other included studies.</P>
<P>Regarding outcomes, only one of the studies included any outcomes for the person with dementia (<LINK REF="STD-Lawton-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Lawton 1989</LINK>). One of the most widely quoted statistics in the respite care literature is the reported 22-day increase of days spent in the community by the experimental group in the <LINK REF="STD-Lawton-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Lawton 1989</LINK> study. As already discussed the analysis in this publication was flawed due to the cluster randomisation process. This is one of the few studies to report a positive effect on rates of institutionalisation. <LINK REF="STD-Lawton-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Lawton 1989</LINK> also reported measures of functional status and mortality rates for the people with dementia, none of which were significantly different between the intervention group and the control group. In not reporting outcomes for the care recipient in the other three trials, a lack of consideration for the recipient is reflected in the wider literature of respite care; this point should be noted by researchers designing further trials.</P>
<P>In addition to the limitations of the outcomes measured for people with dementia, some of the measures used for assessment of the caregivers may have been inappropriate for that population. For example, the Hamilton scales were designed to monitor the progress of those diagnosed with depression or anxiety. It is unrealistic to expect a change by measuring populations such as those in the <LINK REF="STD-Grant-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Grant 2003</LINK> study who largely have subclinical scores. A similar objection can be lodged against the use of the Global Severity Index of the Neuropsychiatric Inventory, which showed low baseline values. The Duke UNC Functional Support Questionnaire was also a questionable choice. It measures perceived social support and may not be sensitive enough to pick up changes in these populations.</P>

<P>Overall the quality of the evidence, based on GRADE, was very low. One study did not report data that could be used in the analysis, the remaining three studies were very small and had short lengths of follow-up. Only <LINK REF="STD-Korn-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Korn 2009</LINK> mentioned blinding of the outcome assessor.

<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2014-01-12 12:01:04 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>To counteract the problems regarding insufficient amount of respite and the need for a suitable control group, Zarit and colleagues carried out a quasi-experimental study comparing caregivers living in two different regions of the USA which were similar demographically but which provided different access to daycare facilities (<LINK REF="STD-Zarit-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Zarit 1998</LINK>). The treatment group comprised 121 carers living in New Jersey, which has a well-developed, subsidised daycare programme, who had enrolled their relatives in this programme. The control group comprised 203 caregivers from Ohio and Pennsylvania where there are very limited daycare programmes. The choice of caregivers for the control group was restricted to those who stated that they would use daycare if it was available. Zarit and colleagues claim that the caregivers in the two groups were similar in all respects apart from their access to daycare; the control group also used very small amounts of other types of respite. The treatment group caregivers showed improvements at three months and 12 months on measures of caregiving-related stress and psychological wellbeing. An advantage of this study over some previous research is that large amounts of respite care were utilized by the treatment group, preventing the possibility that respite was received in amounts that were too small to be of value. However, the lack of randomisation to groups means that we cannot be sure that the differences between the groups were due to the daycare or whether they reflected differences between the groups in other ways that might have affected the results. Zarit indicates that the demographic characteristics of the two regions were similar on per capita income, education, proportion of the population over 65 years, unemployment rates, population density and proportion of minorities. The advantage of randomisation is that as well as controlling for factors that are known to affect relevant outcomes it controls for factors that are not known (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2008</LINK>).</P>

<P>No meaningful conclusions for practice can be drawn with the available evidence. This review has raised the possibility that studies of respite care focus too much on caregivers since only one of the four included studies and a minority of the literature reported any outcomes for the care recipient. We must ensure that at the same time as monitoring and nurturing caregivers, the lack of attention paid to people with dementia in the literature does not translate into a similar lack of attention in practice.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2014-01-12 12:03:51 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Current evidence does not allow one to make any reliable conclusions about the efficacy of respite care for people with dementia and their caregivers. This reflects a lack of high quality research in this difficult area. Future research should consider some of the methodological issues discussed and include outcomes for the care recipients as well as their caregivers.</P>
<P>As mentioned previously, utilization of respite care has been very low in many studies; some caregivers in the <LINK REF="STD-Lawton-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Lawton 1989</LINK> study used no respite care at all. As well as establishing any efficacy or harm associated with respite care, future research needs to explore why such services are not utilized when freely available. There are likely to be multiple reasons for this but one important reason may be the caregiver's anxiety that their relative will not receive care of the highest standard. Thus, it remains an imperative part of future research to evaluate whether any actual harm is associated with provision of respite care for people with dementia.</P>
<P>We present suggestions for future research based on this Cochrane review and the thematic synthesis, and using the EPICOT+ structure (<LINK REF="REF-Brown-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brown 2006</LINK>) in <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>.</P>

<P>Dementia is a common and serious mental health problem affecting 6.4% of the population, and increasing in prevalence with age, from 0.8% in 65 to 69 year olds to 28.5% in people aged 90 years or older. In the coming years an exponential increase in numbers of people affected is anticipated as populations age (<LINK REF="REF-Lobo-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lobo 2000</LINK>). Providing care for a person with dementia in the community commonly places stress on the primary caregiver. Such stress can have a range of adverse effects including the breakdown of the relationship between patient and caregiver, a poorer quality of care, and physical and psychological morbidity for both patient and caregiver (<LINK REF="REF-Neufield-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Neufield 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Parks-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parks 2000</LINK>).</P>

<P>The Specialized Register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group (CDCIG) was searched on 10 December 2007 for all years up to December 2005. This register contains records from the following major healthcare databases: <I>The Cochrane Library</I>, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL and LILACS, and many ongoing trial databases and other grey literature sources. The following search terms were used: respite OR daycare OR caregiver* relief.</P>
<P>
<I>The Cochrane Library</I>, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL and LILACS were searched separately on 10 December 2007 for records added to these databases after December 2005 to December 2007. The search terms used to identify relevant controlled trials on dementia, Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impairment for the Group's Specialized Register can be found in the Group's module in <I>The Cochrane Library</I>. These search terms were combined with the following search terms and adapted for each database, where appropriate: respite* OR daycare OR "caregiver* relief.</P>
<P>On 10 December 2007, the Specialized Register consisted of records from the following databases.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Data collection and analysis</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Selection of studies</HEADING>
<P>One review author (HL) studied the titles and abstracts of those references identified by the search, discarding those that were clearly not relevant and retrieving the remaining ones in hard copy. Both review authors independently assessed the resulting references and preliminarily divided them into excluded and included categories on the basis of the predefined inclusion criteria. Additional information was sought from study authors if appropriate. The review authors reached a final consensus through discussion.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Quality assessment</HEADING>
<P>The review authors assessed the quality of the methods used in each selected trial by looking at randomisation, blinding, patient selection, selection of control group, reporting of results and statistical analysis.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Data extraction</HEADING>
<P>One review author (HL) extracted data from the published reports. The summary statistics required for each trial and each outcome for continuous data were the mean change from baseline, the standard error of the mean change, and the number of patients for each treatment group at each assessment. Where changes from baseline were not reported she extracted the mean, standard deviation and the number of patients for each treatment group at each time point. The baseline assessment was defined as the latest available assessment preceding randomisation, but no longer than two months prior.</P>
<P>For binary data the review authors sought the numbers in each treatment group and the numbers experiencing the outcome of interest. If the only data reported were the treatment effects and their standard errors, then these were extracted. For each outcome measure the reviewers sought data on every patient assessed. To allow an intention-to-treat analysis, the data were sought irrespective of compliance, whether or not the patient was subsequently deemed ineligible, or otherwise excluded from treatment or follow-up. If intention-to-treat data were not available in the publications, the reviewers sought 'on-treatment' data, or the data of those who completed the trial, and indicated it as such.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Data analysis</HEADING>
<P>The outcomes measured in clinical trials of dementia and cognitive impairment often arise from ordinal rating scales. Where the rating scales used in the trials had reasonably large number of categories (more than 10) the data were treated as continuous outcomes arising from normal distributions.</P>
<P>Summary statistics (n, mean and standard deviation) were required for each rating scale at each assessment time for each treatment group in each trial for change from baseline.</P>
<P>When changes from baseline results were not reported, the review authors calculated the required summary statistics from the baseline and assessment time treatment group means and standard deviations. In this case a zero correlation between the measurements at baseline and assessment time was assumed. This method overestimates the standard deviation of the change from baseline, but this conservative approach is considered to be preferable in a meta-analysis.</P>
