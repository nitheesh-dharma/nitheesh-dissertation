<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2012-01-17 15:08:27 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>People with dementia and their caregivers are often advised that 'mental exercise' may be helpful in slowing down the decline in memory and thinking experienced by many people with dementia. This review examined the evidence for one form of mental exercise, described as cognitive stimulation. This involves a wide range of activities that aim to stimulate thinking and memory generally, including discussion of past and present events and topics of interest, word games, puzzles, music and practical activities such as baking or indoor gardening. Typically this is carried out by trained staff with a small group of four or five people with dementia for around 45 minutes at least twice a week. Family caregivers have also been trained to provide cognitive stimulation to their relative on a one-to-one basis.</P>
<P>This review included 15 trials with a total of 718 participants. The findings suggested that cognitive stimulation has a beneficial effect on the memory and thinking test scores of people with dementia. Although based on a smaller number of studies, there was evidence that the people with dementia who took part reported improved quality of life. They were reported to communicate and interact better than previously. No evidence was found of improvements in the mood of participants or their ability to care for themselves or function independently, and there was no reduction in behaviour found difficult by staff or caregivers. Family caregivers, including those who were trained to deliver the intervention, did not report increased levels of strain or burden.</P>
<P>The trials included people in the mild to moderate stages of dementia and the intervention does not appear to be appropriate for people with severe dementia. More research is needed to find out how long the effects of cognitive stimulation last and for how long it is beneficial to continue the stimulation. Involving family caregivers in the delivery of cognitive stimulation is an interesting development and merits further evaluation.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2012-01-17 09:59:16 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Cognitive stimulation is an intervention for people with dementia which offers a range of enjoyable activities providing general stimulation for thinking, concentration and memory usually in a social setting, such as a small group. Its roots can be traced back to Reality Orientation (RO), which was developed in the late 1950s as a response to confusion and disorientation in older patients in hospital units in the USA. RO emphasised the engagement of nursing assistants in a hopeful, therapeutic process but became associated with a rigid, confrontational approach to people with dementia, leading to its use becoming less and less common.</P>
<P>Cognitive stimulation is often discussed in normal ageing as well as in dementia. This reflects a general view that lack of cognitive activity hastens cognitive decline. With people with dementia, cognitive stimulation attempts to make use of the positive aspects of RO whilst ensuring that the stimulation is implemented in a sensitive, respectful and person-centred manner.</P>
<P>There is often little consistency in the application and availability of psychological therapies in dementia services, so a systematic review of the available evidence regarding cognitive stimulation is important in order to identify its effectiveness and to place practice recommendations on a sound evidence base.<BR/>

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2012-01-17 11:16:43 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The trials were identified from a search of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group Specialized Register, called <A HREF="http://www.medicine.ox.ac.uk/alois">ALOIS</A> (updated 6 December 2011). The search termsused were: cognitive stimulation, reality orientation, memory therapy, memory groups, memory support, memory stimulation, global stimulation, cognitive psychostimulation.

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-01-17 10:13:06 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Fifteen RCTs were included in the review. Six of these had been included in the previous review of RO. The studies included participants from a variety of settings, interventions that were of varying duration and intensity, and were from several different countries. The quality of the studies was generally low by current standards but most had taken steps to ensure assessors were blind to treatment allocation. Data were entered in the meta-analyses for 718 participants (407 receiving cognitive stimulation, 311 in control groups). The primary analysis was on changes that were evident immediately at the end of the treatment period. A few studies provided data allowing evaluation of whether any effects were subsequently maintained. A clear, consistent benefit on cognitive function was associated with cognitive stimulation (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.41, 95% CI 0.25 to 0.57). This remained evident at follow-up one to three months after the end of treatment. In secondary analyses with smaller total sample sizes, benefits were also noted on self-reported quality of life and well-being (standardised mean difference: 0.38 [95% CI: 0.11, 0.65]); and on staff ratings of communication and social interaction (SMD 0.44, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.71). No differences in relation to mood (self-report or staff-rated), activities of daily living, general behavioural function or problem behaviour were noted. In the few studies reporting family caregiver outcomes, no differences were noted. Importantly, there was no indication of increased strain on family caregivers in the one study where they were trained to deliver the intervention.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2012-01-17 10:17:38 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There was consistent evidence from multiple trials that cognitive stimulation programmes benefit cognition in people with mild to moderate dementia over and above any medication effects. However, the trials were of variable quality with small sample sizes and only limited details of the randomisation method were apparent in a number of the trials. Other outcomes need more exploration but improvements in self-reported quality of life and well-being were promising. Further research should look into the potential benefits of longer term cognitive stimulation programmes and their clinical significance.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2012-01-17 10:56:13 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Interventions with a cognitive focus have long been used in dementia care. They have been developed in parallel with approaches emphasising the stimulation of the senses (<LINK REF="REF-Woods-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Woods 1977</LINK>). Reality Orientation (RO) (<LINK REF="REF-Taulbee-1966" TYPE="REFERENCE">Taulbee 1966</LINK>) was developed in the late 1950s as a response to confusion and disorientation in older patients in hospital units in the USA, and was the prototype of the cognitive stimulation approach. Classes were held for 30 minutes once or twice per day. Basic personal and current information was presented to the patient and a variety of materials used, such as individual calendars, word-letter games, building blocks and large-piece puzzles. A Reality Orientation board would be used in each session and would list the name of the unit and its location, the day, date, weather, current events etc. The approach emphasised the engagement of nursing assistants in a hopeful, therapeutic process.</P>
<P>The first controlled evaluation of RO was reported in the UK by Brook et al (<LINK REF="STD-Brook-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Brook 1975</LINK>). They found positive benefits on ratings of intellectual and social functioning in patients attending RO group sessions for 30 minutes per day, five days per week for four months compared with a control group who visited a special RO room daily but were not given any encouragement to engage with the materials or each other. A spate of controlled studies followed (<LINK REF="REF-Holden-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Holden 1995</LINK>), with outcome measures typically including assessments of orientation, other aspects of cognitive functioning and level of independent functioning. A Cochrane review specifically examining Reality Orientation (<LINK REF="REF-Spector-2000a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spector 2000a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Spector-2000b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spector 2000b</LINK>) concluded that there was some evidence that RO had benefits for people with dementia on both cognition and behaviour. However, outside of a few countries (notably Italy), RO has been little practised or researched since 1990 and has attracted some criticism (<LINK REF="REF-Burton-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burton 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Dietch-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dietch 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Powell_x002d_Proctor-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Powell-Proctor 1982</LINK>), especially for being applied in a mechanical, inflexible, insensitive and confrontational manner. Doubts were also raised about the clinical significance of any improvements; the person with dementia might now know what day of the week it was but would this have any meaningful impact on the person's life? Such was the concern regarding the insensitive use of RO and other cognitive approaches that one influential set of guidelines on the management of dementia (<LINK REF="REF-APA-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">APA 1997</LINK>) cautioned against their use with the possibility of a negative impact on the person's well-being that outweighed any small cognitive improvements.</P>
<P>In addition to the 'classroom' element of RO, from the early days '24 hour RO' was also advocated. This involves staff taking every opportunity to provide current information to the person, outside of the formal setting of the RO group, as well as using environmental features such as sign-posting and orientation boards to assist orientation. There have been some positive evaluations of the effects of training and sign-posting on orientation around a care facility (for example <LINK REF="STD-Hanley-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Hanley 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McGilton-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">McGilton 2003</LINK>) but the effects of 24 hour RO per se have been more difficult to evaluate. This is not least of all because of the difficulty in monitoring its implementation, with informal interactions being much more difficult to document than a formal group meeting. <LINK REF="STD-Williams-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Williams 1987</LINK> reports using a modified form of 24 hour RO where staff were trained to respond appropriately to residents' requests for information, and found that 90% of staff responses to residents' requests complied with the treatment protocol. This study reported improvements in cognition, independent functioning and orientation, compared with a control group on a separate ward, when this form of 24 hour RO was implemented.</P>
<P>Alongside the RO literature, in recent years there has been increasing discussion of 'cognitive stimulation'. In part this reflects a general view that lack of cognitive activity hastens cognitive decline, in normal ageing as well as in dementia (<LINK REF="STD-Breuil-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Breuil 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Small-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Small 2002</LINK>), and in part it is an attempt to make use of the positive aspects of RO whilst ensuring that it is implemented in a properly sensitive and respectful manner (<LINK REF="STD-Spector-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Spector 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Woods-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Woods 2002</LINK>). There has also been growing interest in the application of various forms of cognitive training and in teaching individual people with dementia to use memory aids and strategies to assist with their particular difficulties that have been identified with the person. A Cochrane review of cognitive training and cognitive rehabilitation in early stage dementia has been completed (<LINK REF="REF-Clare-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clare 2003</LINK>) and it is important to ensure that clear definitions are used to avoid confusion between the various cognition-based approaches, as in the past 'training', 'stimulation' and 'rehabilitation' have been used almost interchangeably.</P>
<P>Clare and Woods (<LINK REF="REF-Clare-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clare 2004</LINK>) proposed the following definitions. </P>
<P>Cognitive stimulation is engagement in a range of activities and discussions (usually in a group) aimed at general enhancement of cognitive and social functioning.</P>
<P>Cognitive training is guided practice on a set of standard tasks designed to reflect particular cognitive functions; a range of difficulty levels may be available within the standard set of tasks to suit the individual's level of ability. It may be offered in individual or group sessions, with pencil and paper or computerised exercises.</P>
<P>Cognitive rehabilitation is an individualised approach where personally relevant goals are identified and the therapist works with the person and his or her family to devise strategies to address these. The emphasis is on improving performance in everyday life rather than on cognitive tests, building on the person's strengths and developing ways of compensating for impairments</P>
<P>Using these definitions, this review included studies on RO group sessions but not on 24 hour RO or direct training in spatial orientation. The primary outcomes examined will be in relation to the person's cognitive functioning. It is considered that this is the minimum expectation of a general approach with this focus. However, given the concerns discussed above of a possible negative effect, measures of quality of life, mood and well-being are highly pertinent secondary outcome measures. The effects on the person's general level of function in everyday life also need to be considered in evaluating the meaning of any changes observed for the individual and his or her supporters. The impact on family caregivers and careworkers is also important to consider as they are key partners in the process of care.</P>

<P>Searches were conducted as detailed above to identify all relevant published studies. The date and time of each search, together with details of the version of the database used, were recorded. Additional information was sought, as outlined above, and hard copies of articles were obtained.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Quality assessment</HEADING>
<P>RCTs were identified and the two review authors (BW and EA) worked independently to determine which studies met the criteria for inclusion. Trials that did not meet the criteria were excluded, and reasons for exclusion were noted in the table 'Characteristics of excluded studies'. Review authors' selections of trials were compared and the final list of included studies was reached by consensus.</P>
<P>The selected RCTs were described in tabular form, permitting an evaluation of their methodological quality. Studies were assessed against a checklist of quality requirements using the Cochrane approach (see risk of bias tables).</P>
<UL>
<LI>Grade A, 'Low risk': adequate concealment (randomisation; concealed allocation).</LI>
<LI>Grade B, 'Unclear risk': "randomised", but methods uncertain.</LI>
<LI>Grade C, 'High risk': inadequate concealment of allocation or no randomisation, or both.</LI>
</UL>
<P>Only trials with a grade A or B ranking were included in the review. Again, the review authors worked independently to ascertain which studies met the quality criteria, and consensus was reached through discussion. Attempts were made to obtain additional information from the study authors when further data were needed.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Data extraction</HEADING>
<P>Data from the RCTs selected for inclusion were extracted, recorded and entered into RevMan. The summary statistics required for each trial and each outcome for continuous data were the mean change from baseline, the standard error of the mean change, and the number of patients for each treatment group at each assessment point. Where changes from baseline were not reported, the review authors extracted the mean, standard deviation and the number of patients for each treatment group at each time point, if available. The review authors calculated the required summary statistics from the baseline and post-treatment group means and standard deviations, assuming in this case a zero correlation between the measurements at the baseline and follow-up time points. This method overestimates the standard deviation of the change from baseline but this conservative approach was chosen as it is preferable in a meta-analysis. For binary data, the review authors sought the numbers in each treatment group and the numbers experiencing the outcome of interest. The baseline assessment was defined as the latest available assessment prior to randomisation, but no longer than two months prior.</P>
<P>For each outcome measure, data were sought on every patient randomised. To allow an intention-to-treat analysis, the data were sought irrespective of compliance and whether or not the patient was subsequently deemed ineligible or otherwise excluded from treatment or follow-up. If intention-to-treat data were not available in the publications, 'on-treatment' data or the data of those who completed the trial were sought and were indicated as such. In studies where a cross-over design was used, only data from the first treatment phase after randomisation were eligible for inclusion.</P>
<P>As the outcomes measured in clinical trials of dementia and cognitive impairment often arise from ordinal rating scales, where the rating scales had a reasonably large number of categories (more than 10) the data were treated as continuous outcomes arising from a normal distribution.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Data analysis</HEADING>
<P>The meta-analyses included the combination of data from trials that may not use the same rating scale to assess an outcome. Therefore, the measure of the treatment difference for any outcome used was the weighted mean difference when the pooled trials used the same rating scale or test and the standardised mean difference (the absolute mean difference divided by the standard deviation) when they used different rating scales or tests. The duration of the trials may vary considerably. If the review authors considered the range too great to combine all trials into one meta-analysis, they divided it into smaller time periods and conducted a separate meta-analysis for each period. Some trials may have contributed data to more than one time period if multiple assessments were made.</P>
<P>The meta-analyses presented overall estimates of the treatment difference from a fixed-effect model and a test for heterogeneity was performed using a standard Chi<SUP>2</SUP> statistic. Where there was evidence of heterogeneity of the treatment effect between trials then a random-effects model was utilised (which results in broader confidence intervals than for those of a fixed-effect model).</P>
<P>The review authors discussed and reached consensus on the interpretation of the statistical analyses, seeking specialist statistical advice from CDCIG as required. The review authors discussed and reached consensus on the presentation of the findings in the background to the review.<BR/>

<P>From the initial set of references identified by the updated systematic searches (since our last review, <LINK REF="REF-Spector-2000a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spector 2000a</LINK>), 53 potentially relevant studies were identified. Of these, seven studies met the inclusion criteria (<LINK REF="STD-Baldelli-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Baldelli 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bottino-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Bottino 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chapman-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Chapman 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Onder-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Onder 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Requena-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Requena 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Spector-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Spector 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Spector-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Spector 2003</LINK>) and were included in this review. Our previous review (<LINK REF="REF-Spector-2000a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spector 2000a</LINK>) included eight studies in the meta-analysis, six of which were included in this replacement review (<LINK REF="STD-Baines-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Baines 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Baldelli-1993a" TYPE="STUDY">Baldelli 1993a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Breuil-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Breuil 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ferrario-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Ferrario 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wallis-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Wallis 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Woods-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Woods 1979</LINK>). For the two studies excluded at this stage, the data needed for the current analyses were not available (<LINK REF="STD-Gerber-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Gerber 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hanley-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Hanley 1981</LINK>). Full details of included studies and reasons for exclusion of excluded studies are presented in the tables 'Characteristics of included studies' and 'Characteristics of excluded studies'. The pre-publication search in December 2011 identified 41 further studies for consideration. Two further studies (<LINK REF="STD-Buschert-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Buschert 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Coen-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Coen 2011</LINK>) met the inclusion criteria and have been added to the review, with three further studies awaiting classification (<LINK REF="STD-Buettner-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Buettner 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fernandez_x002d_Calvo-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Fernandez-Calvo 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Niu-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Niu 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>Overall, 718 participants, 407 in the treatment groups and 311 in the control groups, were included in the analyses of the 15 included studies. The included studies varied in many aspects: (1) participant characteristics; (2) number and duration of cognitive stimulation sessions; (3) activities which defined cognitive stimulation; (4) the activity of the control group; and (5) outcome measures. These factors will be considered in turn.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">1) Participant characteristics</HEADING>
<P>Diagnosis: eight of the nine new studies specified the diagnostic criteria used. <LINK REF="STD-Coen-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Coen 2011</LINK> simply described their participants as having mild to moderate dementia; <LINK REF="STD-Spector-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Spector 2001</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Spector-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Spector 2003</LINK> used DSM-IV criteria, but did not break the participants down by dementia subtype; <LINK REF="STD-Baldelli-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Baldelli 2002</LINK> included similar numbers of participants with &#8220;Degenerative senile dementia of the Alzheimer&#8217;s type (SDAT)&#8221; (N = 46) and &#8220;vascular multi-infarct dementia&#8221; (N = 41), although all had experienced at least one cerebrovascular accident resulting in motor deficits; <LINK REF="STD-Bottino-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Bottino 2005</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Buschert-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Buschert 2011</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Chapman-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Chapman 2004</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Onder-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Onder 2005</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Requena-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Requena 2006</LINK> all specified a diagnosis of probable Alzheimer's disease (AD) according to NINCDS-ADRDA criteria linked with either ICD-10 or DSM-IIIR criteria. In these studies, participants were on a stable dose of an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor (ACHEI) (rivastigmine in the <LINK REF="STD-Bottino-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Bottino 2005</LINK> study; donepezil in the remaining studies apart from <LINK REF="STD-Buschert-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Buschert 2011</LINK> where a variety of medications including memantine were being taken). Amongst the earlier studies, <LINK REF="STD-Breuil-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Breuil 1994</LINK> specified DSM-III criteria for dementia and <LINK REF="STD-Baldelli-1993a" TYPE="STUDY">Baldelli 1993a</LINK> stated that their participants were diagnosed with "Alzheimer&#8217;s (SDAT) ". The four studies from 1991 and earlier specified more general criteria using cognitive measures that indicated that dementia diagnoses were justifiable (<LINK REF="STD-Baines-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Baines 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ferrario-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Ferrario 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wallis-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Wallis 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Woods-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Woods 1979</LINK>).</P>
<P>Ten of the 11 most recent studies provided mean baseline scores on the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), and the 11th (<LINK REF="STD-Ferrario-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Ferrario 1991</LINK>) provided the MMSE score range for participants. <LINK REF="STD-Coen-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Coen 2011</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Spector-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Spector 2001</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Spector-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Spector 2003</LINK> were the only studies with a mean MMSE score in the moderate range (10 to 20), perhaps reflecting the upper limit of 24 for participants to be included in these studies. The mean scores (16.9, 13.1 and 14.4 respectively) were several points lower than those in the eleven studies reporting mean scores (mean average 19.7), and outside the range of 18 to 25 specified by <LINK REF="STD-Ferrario-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Ferrario 1991</LINK>. However, those studies where the mean score was in the mild range (&gt; 20) may well have included participants in the moderate or even the severe range, for example the lowest score in the <LINK REF="STD-Breuil-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Breuil 1994</LINK> study was reported to be 9. In general, however, it can be said that the studies included in this review had targeted participants in the mild to moderate range of cognitive impairment.</P>
<P>The average age of participants was over 70 years in all studies (except <LINK REF="STD-Wallis-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Wallis 1983</LINK> where it was 69.8 years); in 6 studies it was over 80 years. The average mean age across the 15 studies was 78.8 years, with the range of ages that were reported from 38 to 97 years. Over half the studies reported inclusion of participant(s) aged 90 years and above.</P>
<P>Participants were resident in care homes, nursing homes or hospitals, apart from six studies (<LINK REF="STD-Bottino-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Bottino 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Breuil-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Breuil 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Buschert-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Buschert 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chapman-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Chapman 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Onder-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Onder 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Requena-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Requena 2006</LINK>) where all the participants were outpatients living in the community. The participants included in the <LINK REF="STD-Spector-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Spector 2001</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Spector-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Spector 2003</LINK> studies were recruited from both residential care homes and day centres, with the former being in the majority.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">2) Length, number and duration of sessions</HEADING>
<P>The length of the intervention varied from four weeks (the minimum for inclusion in the review) to 24 months, with the stated length of sessions varying from 30 minutes to 90 minutes. In general, the sessions of longer duration were associated with the lowest frequency (once a week). The median session length across the studies was 45 minutes, and the median frequency was three times a week, ranging from once to five times a week. The total possible exposure to the intervention varied dramatically, from 10 to 12 hours (<LINK REF="STD-Baines-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Baines 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Breuil-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Breuil 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chapman-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Chapman 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Coen-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Coen 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Spector-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Spector 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Spector-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Spector 2003</LINK>) to 375 hours in the two-year (<LINK REF="STD-Requena-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Requena 2006</LINK>) study. Across the 15 studies, the median exposure time was 30 hours. <LINK REF="STD-Requena-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Requena 2006</LINK> presented data from both the 12 month and 24 months time point in their study. As there was less attrition at the 12 month time point, and this was more comparable (although still longer) in duration to the other studies, the 12 month data were used in combination with other studies in the meta-analyses, with the 24 month data reported separately.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">3) Activities during cognitive stimulation</HEADING>
<P>The level of detail provided in the published papers regarding the activities undertaken varied greatly. All studies used small group sessions, typically with groups of five to seven participants, with the exception of <LINK REF="STD-Onder-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Onder 2005</LINK> where family caregivers were taught to carry out cognitive stimulation with the person with dementia on an individual basis. These individual sessions, led by family caregivers, included current information, topics of general interest, historical events and famous people, attention, memory and visuo-spatial exercises and the use of clocks, calendars and notes.</P>
<P>Early studies described the use of an RO board and discussion of current orientating information through newspapers, photographs, calendars and clocks etc., with materials selected to stimulate all five senses (for example <LINK REF="STD-Baines-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Baines 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wallis-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Wallis 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Woods-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Woods 1979</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Breuil-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Breuil 1994</LINK> introduced a number of more specific cognitive activities including drawing, associating words, object naming and categorising. <LINK REF="REF-Spector-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spector 2006</LINK> provided a detailed session by session treatment manual for the approach used in their studies. Activities in their sessions were designed with four themes: (1) the senses, (2) remembering the past, (3) people and objects, and (4) everyday practical issues. Activities included naming objects and people, association of words, remembering the past, discussion of hobbies, activities and current affairs, using money, knowing the way around and orientation topics. This treatment manual was also used by <LINK REF="STD-Coen-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Coen 2011</LINK>. <LINK REF="STD-Chapman-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Chapman 2004</LINK> reported topics including current events, discussion of hobbies and activities, education regarding Alzheimer&#8217;s disease, life story work, and links with daily life with groups of six to seven participants. <LINK REF="STD-Bottino-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Bottino 2005</LINK> described temporal and spatial orientation, discussion of interesting themes, reminiscence activities, naming people, planning of daily activities and use of calendars and clocks and other external memory aids. <LINK REF="STD-Requena-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Requena 2006</LINK> described, for groups of five people with dementia, visual images being shown on a TV screen from a computer and that reflected seven themes: orientation, bodily awareness, family and society, caring for oneself, reminiscing, household activities, animals, people and objects. These were accompanied by questions for discussion.</P>
<P>None of the included trials adopted 24 hour RO in addition to group sessions, although <LINK REF="STD-Bottino-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Bottino 2005</LINK> described involving family caregivers in encouraging the use of external memory aids at home, <LINK REF="STD-Buschert-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Buschert 2011</LINK> described the use of exercises and tasks to be carried out at home between sessions and <LINK REF="STD-Onder-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Onder 2005</LINK> encouraged family caregivers to informally engage in reality-based communication with the person with dementia two or three times a day.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">4) Control group(s) activities</HEADING>
<P>In the earlier studies, alternative group activities were offered that were of a social (<LINK REF="STD-Woods-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Woods 1979</LINK>) or diversional (<LINK REF="STD-Wallis-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Wallis 1983</LINK>) nature. <LINK REF="STD-Baines-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Baines 1987</LINK> offered an alternative treatment, reminiscence groups, but for the purposes of this review it was the no-treatment group that was included in the analyses. 'Treatment as usual' or no treatment was the control condition in a number of studies (<LINK REF="STD-Baldelli-1993a" TYPE="STUDY">Baldelli 1993a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Breuil-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Breuil 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Coen-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Coen 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ferrario-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Ferrario 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Spector-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Spector 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Spector-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Spector 2003</LINK>). In those studies where participants were also taking ACHEIs, the control group were typically monitored in relation to the medication (<LINK REF="STD-Chapman-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Chapman 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bottino-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Bottino 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Onder-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Onder 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Requena-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Requena 2006</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Requena-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Requena 2006</LINK> reported that their control participants watched TV whilst the cognitive stimulation groups were in session. <LINK REF="STD-Baldelli-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Baldelli 2002</LINK> engaged both the control and cognitive stimulation participants in a physical therapy programme. <LINK REF="STD-Buschert-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Buschert 2011</LINK> asked control participants to complete pencil and paper tasks at home, encouraged by monthly group meetings.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">5) Outcome measures</HEADING>
<P>As a condition of inclusion, cognitive tests were used in all the studies. Eleven studies used the MMSE (<LINK REF="REF-Folstein-1975" TYPE="REFERENCE">Folstein 1975</LINK>) and eight of the more recent studies also used the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale - Cognitive (ADAS-Cog) (<LINK REF="REF-Rosen-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rosen 1984</LINK>). Unfortunately, only the 10 month follow-up data on these and other measures could be utilised from <LINK REF="STD-Chapman-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Chapman 2004</LINK> as it has not proved possible to obtain their data at earlier time points in an extractable form. Four studies used a self-report quality of life measure with participants with dementia (<LINK REF="STD-Buschert-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Buschert 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chapman-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Chapman 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Coen-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Coen 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Spector-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Spector 2003</LINK>), but again the <LINK REF="STD-Chapman-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Chapman 2004</LINK> data was not in a useable form. Five studies used a self-report depression measure (four making use of a version of the Geriatric Depression Scale: <LINK REF="REF-Yesavage-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yesavage 1983</LINK>), and four studies used a depression or anxiety scale completed from carer reports as well as from interviews with the participants (such as the Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia: <LINK REF="REF-Alexopoulos-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alexopoulos 1988</LINK>). A variety of scales have been used to evaluate behaviour, with activities of daily living (ADL) scales used in four studies, general behaviour ratings in seven studies and problem behaviour scales used in three studies. Family caregiver outcome measures were used in three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Bottino-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Bottino 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Onder-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Onder 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Spector-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Spector 2001</LINK>).</P>

<P>For a study to be included in this review, the review authors had to be satisfied that random allocation to treatment conditions had been used. To ascertain this, in several cases it was necessary to seek further information from the study authors (for example <LINK REF="STD-Baldelli-1993a" TYPE="STUDY">Baldelli 1993a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Baldelli-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Baldelli 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ferrario-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Ferrario 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Requena-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Requena 2006</LINK>). Remote or computerised randomisation was only used in four of the most recent studies (<LINK REF="STD-Bottino-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Bottino 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chapman-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Chapman 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Buschert-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Buschert 2011</LINK>). Earlier studies described drawing names from a hat or a sealed container, where it was possible to obtain details of the randomisation procedure.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="6">Performance bias</HEADING>
<P>With psychological interventions, unlike drug trials, it is impossible to totally blind participants and staff to treatment. Participants will often be aware that they are being treated preferentially and the staff involved may have different expectations of treatment groups. There may also be 'contamination' between groups in terms of group sessions not being held in separate rooms and staff bringing ideas from one group to another, so that control participants receive elements of cognitive stimulation. The latter effect would be reduced with clear therapeutic protocols, the existence of which was not clear in most study reports.</P>
<P>In relation to contamination, <LINK REF="STD-Wallis-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Wallis 1983</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Baines-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Baines 1987</LINK> both stated that the staff were unaware of the allocation of participants to groups, as they were removed from the ward setting for treatment, and several other studies described the groups being run in a separate or specific room (for example <LINK REF="STD-Ferrario-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Ferrario 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Spector-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Spector 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Spector-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Spector 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Woods-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Woods 1979</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="6">Detection bias</HEADING>
<P>Most studies took steps to ensure that at least part of the assessment of outcomes was carried out by assessors blind to treatment allocation. Only three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Baldelli-1993a" TYPE="STUDY">Baldelli 1993a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Baldelli-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Baldelli 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ferrario-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Ferrario 1991</LINK>) did not report blinding of assessors. Of course, even independent assessors may be given clues from participants during the assessments, but this was not reported as an issue in the studies reviewed here. Using independent assessors works well for evaluating changes in cognition or self-reported mood, well-being and quality of life. Ratings of day-to-day behaviour and function are typically carried out by care staff, who may be more difficult to keep blind to group allocation, unless the group sessions were carried out in a separate location to which all participants were taken.</P>

In contrast, <LINK REF="STD-Breuil-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Breuil 1994</LINK> stated that "All those who for any reason did not attend all evaluation and training sessions were eliminated", with five participants excluded on this basis (three from the cognitive stimulation group).</P>

<P>The absence of detailed treatment protocols raised queries regarding the extent to which the cognitive stimulation was delivered as intended (having noted that there may have been differences in emphases between studies in any case). Several studies noted that staff received training or supervision, or both, in running the groups and, from an early study, <LINK REF="STD-Woods-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Woods 1979</LINK> stated in a personal communication that "A sample of sessions were tape-recorded and rated to ensure compliance with the therapeutic protocol".

<P>For the overall evaluation of the effects of cognitive stimulation on cognitive function, all 14 RCTs which included useable data immediately post-treatment were included, including a total of 658 people with dementia of whom 377 received cognitive stimulation and 281 received no treatment or a placebo treatment. As most studies included more than one measure of cognitive function, this analysis was conducted on the most extensive assessment included. For seven studies this was the ADAS-Cog, and for two each it was the MMSE and CAPE Information/Orientation scales. The overall effect size, the standardised mean difference (SMD) was 0.41 (95% CI 0.25 to 0.57). This was a statistically significant finding (Z = 5.04, P &lt; 0.00001). For the seven studies, including 434 participants, using the ADAS-Cog as an outcome measure (<LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>), the mean difference between the cognitive stimulation and control groups was 2.27 points (95% CI 0.99 to 3.55), a statistically significant difference (Z = 3.48, P &lt; 0.0005). In total, 10 studies involving 600 participants used the MMSE (<LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK>). The overall mean difference was 1.74 points (95% CI 1.13 to 2.36). Again, this was a statistically significant difference (Z = 5.57, P &lt; 0.00001). These analyses were strongly influenced by two of the more recent studies, <LINK REF="STD-Spector-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Spector 2003</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Onder-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Onder 2005</LINK>, which were relatively large and had smaller confidence intervals around their reported mean differences. Five of the older studies involving 81 participants used other measures of information or orientation (<LINK REF="FIG-04" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 4</LINK>); here the SMD was no smaller (SMD 0.45, 95% CI -0.01 to 0.90) and was just statistically significant despite the much smaller numbers involved (Z = 1.93, P = 0.05).</P>
<P>The largest effect sizes were seen at the 12 month time point in the <LINK REF="STD-Requena-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Requena 2006</LINK> study (SMD 0.70 on ADAS-Cog) and the <LINK REF="STD-Baldelli-1993a" TYPE="STUDY">Baldelli 1993a</LINK> study (SMD 0.99 on MMSE), both of which offered above average durations of exposure to cognitive stimulation. However, <LINK REF="STD-Breuil-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Breuil 1994</LINK>, which offered only 10 hours exposure, also had an above average effect size (0.63 on global cognitive score) and other studies with longer exposure (for example <LINK REF="STD-Ferrario-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Ferrario 1991</LINK>) had below average effect sizes. The 24 month data from <LINK REF="STD-Requena-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Requena 2006</LINK> indicated that effect sizes appeared to be maintained through continued exposure (ADAS-Cog SMD 0.66: MD 11.94 points, 95% CI -0.97 to 24.85; MMSE SMD 0.56: MD 5.99 points, 95% CI -1.58 to 13.56).

<P>Staff ratings of mood and anxiety similarly did not show any benefit from cognitive stimulation. Four studies, involving 239 participants, contributed to this analysis, two using the Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia, a third using a subscale of the MOSES scale and the fourth the Rating of Anxiety in dementia.

Four studies, involving 160 participants, used ADL scales. There was no benefit identified with cognitive stimulation (SMD 0.21, 95% CI -0.05 to 0.47) (Z = 1.56, P = 0.12). Three studies, including 166 participants, used scales evaluating behaviour problems. Again there was no difference related to cognitive stimulation (SMD -0.14, 95% CI -0.44 to 0.17) (Z = 0.86, P = 0.39). General behaviour rating scales showed a similar picture, with no difference emerging.

<P>Three studies reported on outcomes for family caregivers. The largest of these (<LINK REF="STD-Onder-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Onder 2005</LINK>) taught family caregivers to deliver the cognitive stimulation, so the effects on caregivers were especially pertinent for that study. The effect sizes for anxiety, depression and caregiver burden were all close to zero (SMDs 0.11, 0.04, -0.03 respectively), with confidence intervals crossing zero indicating no differences between the caregivers in the cognitive stimulation condition and those in the control conditions.</P>
<P>Only one study (<LINK REF="STD-Baines-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Baines 1987</LINK>) reported outcomes for care staff, so no meta-analysis was possible.

<P>The analyses for assessments carried out after the intervention had been completed were reported in two groups: <LINK REF="STD-Baines-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Baines 1987</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Wallis-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Wallis 1983</LINK> had a one month follow-up, and <LINK REF="STD-Baldelli-1993a" TYPE="STUDY">Baldelli 1993a</LINK> a three month follow-up on certain measures. These three studies represent a short term follow-up; whereas <LINK REF="STD-Chapman-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Chapman 2004</LINK> reported useable data only from a 10 month follow-up, a much longer period in the context of the progression of dementia.</P>
<P>For cognitive measures (<LINK REF="FIG-13" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 13</LINK>), the three older studies with short term follow-up reported data for 52 participants. The significant advantage for cognitive stimulation on cognitive measures seen immediately post-treatment remained at this point (SMD 0.57, 95% CI 0.01 to 1.14) (Z = 2.00, P = 0.05). For the 54 participants included by <LINK REF="STD-Chapman-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Chapman 2004</LINK>, there was no significant effect on either the MMSE (SMD 0.18) or the ADAS-Cog (SMD 0.12) at the 10 month follow-up.</P>
<P>For self-report well-being and quality of life measures (<LINK REF="FIG-14" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 14</LINK>), the only short term follow-up data came from <LINK REF="STD-Baines-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Baines 1987</LINK>, with only 10 participants, and showed no differences. The longer term follow-up from <LINK REF="STD-Chapman-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Chapman 2004</LINK> showed a SMD of 0.34 for the QoL-AD measure but this difference was not significant. No measures of mood were included in the studies reporting follow-up.</P>
<P>For general behaviour rating scales (<LINK REF="FIG-15" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 15</LINK>), two studies reported short term follow-up, with 29 participants. The SMD of 0.44 was not significant. Similarly at 10 months the scale used by <LINK REF="STD-Chapman-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Chapman 2004</LINK> showed a non-significant SMD of 0.43. A similar picture appeared in relation to problem behaviour (<LINK REF="FIG-16" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 16</LINK>), where there was only one small study in the short term follow-up group (<LINK REF="STD-Baines-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Baines 1987</LINK>) and the longer term follow-up reported by <LINK REF="STD-Chapman-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Chapman 2004</LINK> did not show a significant difference on either the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) severity score (SMD 0.29) or the caregiver distress score related to the problem behaviour (SMD 0.41).</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2012-01-17 18:03:28 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In total, 15 RCTs with a total of 718 participants (407 receiving cognitive stimulation, 311 in control groups) met the inclusion criteria for the meta-analyses. The most striking finding reflects the effects of cognitive stimulation on performance in tests of cognitive function. The results of the meta-analyses reported here indicate that cognitive stimulation programmes for dementia have a significant positive effect on cognition, which is evident in the post-2000 studies included in this review as well as in the older studies which were included in our previous review of Reality Orientation. This is perhaps the most consistent finding in the literature on psychological interventions with people with dementia. The studies included here came from a variety of countries and contexts, from France, the UK, Italy, Spain and Brazil; from hospital, care home, nursing home, day centre and outpatient settings; and administered in groups by staff or volunteers, or individually by family caregivers.</P>
<P>The extent to which these changes in cognitive function are clinically important has not been generally addressed. An average benefit of 1.74 points on the MMSE or 2.27 points on the ADAS-Cog can be taken to indicate a slowing down of the rate of decline, which has been estimated, in mild to moderate dementia, to be between 2 and 4 points on the MMSE per annum (<LINK REF="REF-Mohs-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mohs 2000</LINK>). In relation to the number needed to treat (NNT) for one more participant in the treatment group than in the control group to benefit by a certain amount, <LINK REF="STD-Spector-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Spector 2003</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Onder-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Onder 2005</LINK> provide some evidence. For an improvement of 4 or more points on the ADAS-Cog, <LINK REF="STD-Spector-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Spector 2003</LINK> calculated an NNT of 6, and <LINK REF="STD-Onder-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Onder 2005</LINK> 14, figures broadly comparable to those seen in trials of the ACHEIs.</P>
<P>However, as has been pointed out repeatedly over the years (<LINK REF="STD-Woods-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Woods 2006</LINK>), changes in cognition are not sufficient to justify an extensive programme of intervention, unless they are accompanied by other changes, in behaviour and well-being. Here there are two positive findings. Firstly, results from four RCTs (with 223 participants) indicated that positive changes in communication and social interaction were evident in staff ratings outside the context of the cognitive stimulation group sessions. Secondly, results from four RCTs (219 participants) identified a benefit on quality of life and well-being associated with cognitive stimulation.</P>
<P>In contrast, there was no indication that cognitive stimulation was associated with changes in mood, whether self-rated or rated by staff, or in behaviour including activities of daily living and self-care and problem behaviour. It is notable that in general there is much less evidence available regarding these domains compared with that available for changes in cognition. No benefits to family caregivers were identified in terms of mood or caregiver burden. However, it is important to note that in the study where the responsibility for delivering the cognitive stimulation fell on famiy caregivers (<LINK REF="STD-Onder-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Onder 2005</LINK>), this additional task did not appear to add to their stress and strain. One study showed an improvement in care home staff knowledge of residents following participation in cognitive stimulation.</P>
<P>There is little evidence available on the cost-effectiveness of cognitive stimulation (CST). <LINK REF="REF-Knapp-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Knapp 2006</LINK> reported cost-effectiveness acceptability curves for cognition and quality of life from the <LINK REF="STD-Spector-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Spector 2003</LINK> trial and conclude that, for both outcomes, 'under reasonable assumptions, there is a high probability that CST is more cost-effective than treatment as usual'.</P>
<P>These findings all relate to the assessment point immediately after the treatment period has been completed. Only four relatively small studies reported data on whether any changes were maintained after a period of follow-up without further intervention. Here, again, cognition stands out with three RCTs showing a positive effect evident at a follow-up of one to three months after the intervention; this was not evident in the one RCT reporting a 10 month follow-up. Other follow-up data were limited in their extent and scope but there were no indications of benefits in the areas of behaviour and well-being that were evaluated.</P>
<P>A key area of difference between studies relates to the duration and frequency of the cognitive stimulation offered, leading to a wide variation in the 'dosage' of cognitive stimulation received, as indicated by the total number of hours of stimulation offered. As pointed out previously, there does not appear to be a clear relationship between dosage and the effect size on cognitive function in the various studies; the Spearman's correlation was 0.25 (N = 14, P = 0.392). It is difficult to ascertain whether the frequency of sessions per week makes a difference as the study with the largest effect sizes (<LINK REF="STD-Requena-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Requena 2006</LINK>) has five 45-minute sessions per week and has the longest duration. As the duration increases, the anticipated decline associated with dementia should tend to reduce the effects of cognitive stimulation, and so a simple linear relationship is unlikely to hold. One study (<LINK REF="STD-Requena-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Requena 2006</LINK>) continued cognitive stimulation for two years. The decision was made to include one year data from this study in the primary meta-analyses reported here, to reduce the impact of attrition. However, the effects on cognition and self-reported mood appeared to be sustained over a further one year period, although the effects were not statistically significant in our analyses. There is a need for further research on maintenance cognitive stimulation, looking at whether lower-intensity input maintains gains from an initial period of cognitive stimulation (<LINK REF="STD-Aguirre-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Aguirre 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>In five of the included studies all of the participants were prescribed ACHEI medication. For the four of these RCTs providing post-treatment data, the additional effect of cognitive stimulation over and above the medication was 3.18 points on the ADAS-Cog, compared with the overall finding (from seven RCTs) of 2.27 points. This supports the proposition that cognitive stimulation is effective irrespective of whether or not ACHEIs are prescribed, and any effects are in addition to those associated with the medication. One study (<LINK REF="STD-Requena-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Requena 2006</LINK>) reported comparative results from a control group who received neither cognitive stimulation nor an ACHEI, but this was not a randomly allocated condition so that the additive effects of these two treatment approaches were not established compared with no treatment. Such a study would perhaps not now be seen as ethical in a context where ACHEIs are seen as standard treatment for Alzheimer-type dementia.</P>
<P>In general, it appears that outcome measures rated by staff are less likely to indicate positive change than those that are completed by the person with dementia directly with an assessor blinded to the treatment received. In a care home or hospital context, it is well known that achieving consistent staff ratings in research studies such as these is a major challenge. It can often be impossible to have the same staff member rate the person at each time point due to staff turn-over and sickness. There can be a 'drift' in ratings over time, even with the same rater. The observation period and opportunities for observation may vary over time. Maintaining staff blind to treatment allocation is more challenging than for an assessor who only visits the facility to carry out the assessments. The one area of staff-rated behaviour showing change in this review relates to communication and social interaction, an area that has not been highlighted in previous reviews of this type of intervention. Given the social emphasis of cognitive stimulation groups, this is an area of behaviour that is most closely linked to the content of the intervention. Indeed, <LINK REF="REF-Spector-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spector 2010</LINK> have demonstrated that in their study language function was an area of specific cognitive improvement.</P>
<P>Inevitably where the control condition is 'no treatment', the question is raised as to whether any benefits associated with the treatment arise from non-specific effects such as meeting as a group, socialising, increased attention and so on. A few early studies did include an 'attention' control group (<LINK REF="STD-Woods-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Woods 1979</LINK>) or diversional occupational therapy (<LINK REF="STD-Wallis-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Wallis 1983</LINK>) and one study offered physical rehabilitation sessions to both groups (<LINK REF="STD-Baldelli-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Baldelli 2002</LINK>). In the <LINK REF="STD-Requena-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Requena 2006</LINK> study where stimulation materials were presented on a TV screen to the group, control participants watched TV elsewhere. Although we cannot provide a definitive conclusion on this matter, our results did not indicate any effects of these different control conditions on outcome. In a mediation analysis, <LINK REF="STD-Woods-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Woods 2006</LINK> demonstrated that in the <LINK REF="STD-Spector-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Spector 2003</LINK> RCT the improvements in quality of life were mediated by improvements in cognition, suggesting that it is the cognitive focus of the cognitive stimulation therapy programmes (rather than merely the social contact and attention) which lead to improved well-being. Further work is required to explore the relationship between changes in cognition and the changes in well-being and quality of life and communication that are emerging from the current review.</P>
<P>The quality of the included studies is variable, and generally low, with lack of clarity regarding randomisation procedures being evident in around half the studies (including some of the more recent studies). CONSORT type diagrams depicting the flow of participants through the trial are provided by four of the recent studies (<LINK REF="STD-Bottino-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Bottino 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Buschert-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Buschert 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Onder-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Onder 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Spector-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Spector 2003</LINK>) and, along with remote, independent randomisation, will be a minimum expectation in future trials. The number of participants included has increased markedly from an average of 23 per study prior to 2000 to 64 in the nine more recent studies. Larger sample sizes will necessitate multi-centre trials, for example <LINK REF="STD-Spector-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Spector 2003</LINK> recruited from 23 centres. This will have implications for analyses, with cluster effects within a centre, even though participants are individually randomised. <LINK REF="STD-Spector-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Spector 2003</LINK> accordingly included centre as a covariate in their analyses. Studies do not yet appear to have taken account of clustering effects arising from a group intervention. This occurs where changes in group members are not entirely independent. Group leaders often report that some groups seem to work much better than others for example. Intention-to-treat analyses were only described by two (recent) studies, although in most cases details of attrition were reported. The need for assessors to be blind to treatment allocation is widely recognised and attempted in most studies. More attention may need to be given in future studies to demonstrating the extent to which the cognitive stimulation is delivered as planned. Well-developed treatment manuals will help with assuring the replicability of the intervention. In general, there is a clear improvement in overall quality of the included studies over time, for example in the more consistent information given regarding the diagnosis of participants and the criteria used, as well as the use of consistent outcome measures and larger sample size.</P>
<P>The studies included in the review utilised therapists with a variety of backgrounds, experience and training. They included volunteers, family caregivers, speech and language therapists, occupational therapists, nurses, care workers and research staff. There are no indications from this review of the amount or type of training required to deliver cognitive stimulation, although there is broad agreement that whilst training is needed the therapist does not need a professional qualification. Given the concerns regarding RO being delivered in a mechanical, dehumanising fashion (<LINK REF="REF-Dietch-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dietch 1989</LINK>), training and supervision in person-centred care would be seen as a prerequisite for delivery of cognitive stimulation. In this review, there were no reported side effects or adverse effects of any of the cognitive stimulation interventions. Attrition was due to expected reasons in studies of this nature: illness, death, transfer to another facility and occasional refusal to complete follow-up assessments. With only one study utilising an individual approach, in contrast to offering group cognitive stimulation, it is not possible to draw on any evidence on the strengths and benefits of these different treatment modalities.</P>
<P>The range of severity of dementia experienced by patients included in the studies reviewed here ranged from mild to moderate. There was no indication that the two studies with the lowest mean MMSE scores of participants (<LINK REF="STD-Spector-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Spector 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Spector-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Spector 2003</LINK>) had any different effects than those with more mildly impaired participants. Most studies included a mixture of participants with mild and moderate dementia. <LINK REF="STD-Onder-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Onder 2005</LINK> indicated that there was no differential benefit to either group, with no significant interaction between severity of dementia and treatment on change in either MMSE or ADAS-Cog scores. More work may be needed to define if there are people with dementia, or subgroups, who are more or less likely to benefit from a cognitive stimulation intervention. No analyses have been attempted here seeking to establish whether different subtypes of the dementias show specific responses to cognitive stimulation. One study (<LINK REF="STD-Baldelli-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Baldelli 2002</LINK>) included only participants who had had a cerebrovascular accident (CVA), although less than half the participants had a diagnosis of vascular dementia. Most recent studies have included those who are receiving AChEI medication, with a probable Alzheimer's diagnosis, whereas <LINK REF="STD-Spector-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Spector 2003</LINK> included all types of dementia. Given that the average age of participants across the review was almost 80 years (over 85 in the <LINK REF="STD-Spector-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Spector 2003</LINK> study), it is highly likely that neurodegenerative and vascular changes are co-occurring in the majority of participants, and so the distinction may be of limited pragmatic utility.</P>
<P>The findings of this review are broadly in line with other more wide-ranging reviews of non-pharmacological interventions in dementia. <LINK REF="REF-Livingston-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Livingston 2005</LINK> gives a relatively strong recommendation for cognitive stimulation in relation to its effects on neuropsychiatric symptoms, including mood, but notes some inconsistencies in the evidence on these outcomes. <LINK REF="REF-Sitzer-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sitzer 2006</LINK> included 17 studies in their meta-analysis of 'cognitive training' in Alzheimer&#8217;s disease, four of which met our definition of 'cognitive stimulation' and three of which are included in this review. <LINK REF="REF-Sitzer-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sitzer 2006</LINK> concludes that there is a medium effect size (0.47) across all types of 'training' over the whole range of outcome measures, making 'cognitive training' a promising intervention. However, it is noteworthy that general stimulation techniques were prominent in four of the five trials reporting the most beneficial results, with the review describing these as 'restorative strategies'. <LINK REF="REF-Olazaran-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Olazaran 2010</LINK> reviewed 179 RCTs across 26 categories of non-pharmacological interventions. They concluded that there was 'Grade B' evidence (consistent evidence from lower quality RCTs) for cognitive stimulation in relation to cognition, behaviour and psychological well-being. They did not identify any 'Grade A' evidence (consistent evidence from high quality RCTs) for any interventions with people with dementia, although some caregiver interventions did reach this level. The 2011 World Alzheimer's Report (<LINK REF="REF-Prince-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Prince 2011</LINK>) concludes, from a wide-ranging systematic review, "We found strong evidence (multiple RCTs) that acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (for cognitive function, functional impairment), and cognitive stimulation (for cognitive function) are effective interventions in mild dementia" and makes the following recommendation in relation to interventions for early-stage dementia: "Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and cognitive stimulation may enhance cognitive function in people with mild Alzheimer&#8217;s disease, and these interventions should therefore be routinely offered."</P>
<P>Finally, consideration should be given to the possibility of publication bias in this domain. By reviewing only the studies on cognitive stimulation that have been published in peer-reviewed journals, it must be acknowledged that these could represent a biased sample of the studies undertaken world-wide on this topic. In many fields of endeavour, trials that are not successful (that is do not produce the expected positive findings) are less likely to be published. This may be especially the case with smaller trials. The welcome trend to pre-registration of trials, and the publication of trial protocols, makes this less likely to occur in the future in relation to larger, well-funded trials. The meta-analyses here have been influenced strongly by the larger trials included (such as <LINK REF="STD-Spector-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Spector 2003</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Onder-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Onder 2005</LINK>), and a funnel plot of the cognition outcome appears reasonably symmetrical (<LINK REF="FIG-18" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 18</LINK>) suggesting that possible publication bias is not a strong factor for this outcome at least.</P>

<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2012-01-17 18:05:58 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2012-01-17 13:36:15 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The evidence base for the effectiveness of cognitive stimulation therapy for dementia in relation to cognitive function has been consistently demonstrated, with small changes reported in multiple trials on commonly used brief measures of cognitive function; adverse effects have not been reported. There is now evidence from a small number of studies that cognitive stimulation may also be associated with improvements in quality of life and communication. These benefits are over and above any medication effects.</P>
<P>This review is consistent with the <LINK REF="REF-NICE_x002d_SCIE-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE-SCIE 2006</LINK> Guideline recommendation that all people with mild to moderate dementia should have the opportunity to participate in cognitive stimulation groups, irrespective of whether or not they are receiving acetylcholinesterase inhibiting medication (ACHEIs). This recommendation was recently reinforced by the World Alzheimer's Report (<LINK REF="REF-Prince-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Prince 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>Although more research is needed, results from one study suggest that continuing involvement in cognitive stimulation may be beneficial.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2012-01-17 18:05:58 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There are a number of areas, relating to both theory and practice, where further research is required. Now that its effects are becoming better established, the theoretical basis of cognitive stimulation would benefit from fuller investigation. This would involve studying cognitive changes both in relationship to neural processes and pathways; and their linkage, if any, with outcomes such as mood, quality of life, day-to-day function and behaviour.</P>
<P>There is a clear need for more randomised controlled trials of cognitive stimulation exploring the long term benefits of this intervention. The effects of severity of dementia and different modalities (for example group versus with caregiver) need to be systematically evaluated. These RCTs may be of particular value if used in conjunction with more qualitative studies in order to understand the relationships between the different outcome measures. The clinical meaningfulness of any benefits needs to be examined, particularly in relation to the impact of any cognitive changes. Are there benefits in terms of increased participation in activities of importance to the person, increased social inclusion or of individual goals being attained?</P>
<P>Only one cost-effectiveness study has been identified to date and this gap should be addressed, particularly in relation to clinically meaningful benefits.</P>
<P>Finally, the implementation of cognitive stimulation in real-life settings needs to be addressed. The key issue here is whether the results obtained by those who attend brief training in the methods or make use of one of the treatment manuals that have been developed, or both, are comparable to those obtained in the context of research studies and RCTs.</P>
