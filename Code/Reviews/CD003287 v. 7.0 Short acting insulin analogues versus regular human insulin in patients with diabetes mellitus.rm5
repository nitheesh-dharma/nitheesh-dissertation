<DESCRIPTION>
<P>This review is an update of the review published in issue 4, 2004 (second update of the original version).<BR/>
<BR/>A highly sensitive search applying the same search strategy as used for the original review was performed from 01/10/2003 to 21/09/2005 (adding the search terms for glulisine, which is new on the market) : 386 potentially relevant abstracts were identified and screened for retrieval. 375 of these were excluded by consensus. Eleven publications were potentially appropriate to be included in this systematic review, of which further 4 were excluded by consensus because of not being randomised, no comparable insulin regimen were used or analogues were not compared with regular insulin. Finally, seven new studies fulfilled the criteria to be included into this systematic review. For further details see figure 9 presenting the flow chart according the QUOROM statement.<BR/>
<BR/>After including the 7 new studies in the analyses the conclusion drawn from the first systematic review remained unchanged.</P>

<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Short acting insulin analogues (Lispro, Aspart, Glulisine) act more quickly than regular human insulin. It can be injected immediately before meals and leads to lower blood sugar levels after food intake. Our analysis showed that short acting insulin analogues were almost identically effective to regular human insulin in long term glycaemic control and were associated with similar episodes of low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia). No information on late complications such as problems with the eyes, kidneys or feet are existing. Until long term safety data are available we suggest a cautious response to the vigorous promotion of insulin analogues. </P>

<P>Altogether 8274 participants took part in 49 randomised controlled studies. Most studies were of poor methodological quality. <BR/>In patients with type 1 diabetes, the weighted mean difference (WMD) of HbA1c was -0.1% (95% CI: -0.2 to -0.1) in favour of insulin analogue, whereas in patients with type 2 diabetes the WMD was 0.0% (95% CI: -0.1 to 0.0). <BR/>In subgroup analyses of different types of interventions in type 1 diabetic patients, the WMD in HbA1c was -0.2% (95% CI: -0.3 to -0.1) in favour of insulin analogue in studies using continuous subcutaneous insulin injections (CSII), whereas for conventional intensified insulin therapy (IIT) studies the WMD in HbA1c was -0.1% (95% CI: -0.1 to 0.0). <BR/>The WMD of the overall mean hypoglycaemic episodes per patient per month was -0.2 (95% CI: -1.1 to 0.7) and -0.2 (95% CI: -0.5 to 0.1) for analogues in comparison to regular insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes, respectively. <BR/>For studies in type 1 diabetes patients the incidence of severe hypoglycaemia ranged from 0 to 247.3 (median 21.8) episodes per 100 person-years for insulin analogues and from 0 to 544 (median 46.1) for regular insulin, in type 2 the incidence ranged from 0 to 30.3 (median 0.3) episodes per 100 person-years for insulin analogues and from 0 to 50.4 (median 1.4) for regular insulin. <BR/>No study was designed to investigate possible long term effects (e.g. mortality, diabetic complications), in particular in patients with diabetes related complications.<BR/> </P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>Our analysis suggests only a minor benefit of short acting insulin analogues in the majority of diabetic patients treated with insulin. Until long term efficacy and safety data are available we suggest a cautious response to the vigorous promotion of insulin analogues. For safety purposes, we need a long-term follow-up of large numbers of patients and well designed studies in pregnant women to determine the safety profile for both the mother and the unborn child. </P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2008-11-05 13:16:29 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gudrun Paletta">
<P>Diabetes mellitus is a metabolic disorder resulting from a defect in insulin secretion, insulin action, or both. This in turn leads to chronic hyperglycaemia (that is elevated levels of plasma glucose) with disturbances of carbohydrate, fat and protein metabolism. Long-term complications of diabetes mellitus include retinopathy, nephropathy, neuropathy and increased risk of cardiovascular disease. For a detailed overview of diabetes mellitus, please see 'Additional information' in the information on the Metabolic and Endocrine Disorders Group in <I>The Cochrane Library</I> (see 'About The Cochrane Collaboration', 'Cochrane Review Groups (CRGs)'). For an explanation of methodological terms, see the main Glossary in <I>The Cochrane Library</I>.</P>

<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2008-11-05 13:18:00 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gudrun Paletta">
<P>Despite improved purity and stability of the available insulin preparations, it has become apparent that the pharmacokinetics following subcutaneous injection of the currently available structurally unchanged regular insulin preparations make it difficult to achieve day-long normoglycaemia (<LINK REF="REF-Zinman-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zinman 1989</LINK>). In the last decade, considerable attention has been devoted to the development of insulin analogues with pharmacokinetic profiles that differ from those of existing insulin preparations. Compared to regular human insulin, proline at position 28 and lysine at position 29 of the B-region were interchanged in the short acting insulin analogue Lispro (HumalogR). In the short acting insulin analogue Aspart (NovoRapidR), proline at position 28 of the B-region was replaced by aspartic acid and in the short acting insulin analogue Glulisine (ApidraR), the amino acid asparagine was replaced by lysine at position 3 and lysine with glutamic acid at position 29 of the B-chain. Plasma insulin concentrations peak from two to four hours after injection of regular insulin, unlike the much earlier plasma insulin peak in non-diabetic individuals after meal ingestion. This low rise to peak insulin concentration is likely to account for much of the observed hyperglycaemia following meals in people with diabetes. The delay in the absorption of subcutaneously administered regular insulin is due to the fact that in this preparation, insulin tends to associate in 'clusters' of six molecules (hexamers), and time is needed after injection for these clusters to dissociate to single molecules which can be used by the body (<LINK REF="REF-Mosekilde-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mosekilde 1989</LINK>). Short acting insulin analogues with less tendency toward self-association are therefore absorbed more quickly, achieving peak plasma concentrations about twice as high and within approximately half the time compared to regular insulin (<LINK REF="REF-Howey-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Howey 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Torlone-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Torlone 1994</LINK>).</P>
<P>This pharmacokinetic profile leads to lower glucose levels after meals (<LINK REF="REF-Howey-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Howey 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Heinemann-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heinemann 1996</LINK>) and should improve overall glycaemic control. It has been proposed that lower postprandial glucose may be associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular complications in diabetes (<LINK REF="REF-Haffner-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haffner 1998</LINK>). One suggested advantage of short acting insulin analogues is the possibility to inject insulin immediately before meals, even if in daily life most diabetic patients seem to use short or even no injection-meal interval (<LINK REF="REF-Heinemann-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heinemann 1995</LINK>). Further proposed advantages in terms of quality of life are changes in injection modes with the possibility of injecting short acting insulin analogues after meals without deterioration of prandial glycaemic control (<LINK REF="REF-Brunner-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brunner 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schernthaner-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schernthaner 1998</LINK>).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Adverse effects of the intervention</HEADING>
<P>Treatment with the three short acting insulin analogues (Lispro - HumalogR, Aspart - Novo RapidR, Glulisine - ApidraR) available on the market is currently promoted with purported advantages with respect to metabolic control or reduced incidence of hypoglycaemic episodes for patients with diabetes mellitus (<LINK REF="REF-Ahmed-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ahmed 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Anderson-1997b" TYPE="STUDY">Anderson 1997b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Anderson-1997c" TYPE="STUDY">Anderson 1997c</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Holleman-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Holleman 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Martin-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Martin 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vignati-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Vignati 1997</LINK>). On the other hand, several studies failed to show a positive effect on overall blood glucose levels when short acting insulin analogues were compared with regular insulin (<LINK REF="STD-Anderson-1997a" TYPE="STUDY">Anderson 1997a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gale-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Gale 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Garg-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Garg 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Holleman-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Holleman 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jacobs-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Jacobs 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pfuetzner-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Pfuetzner 1996</LINK>). Insulin treatment strategies, where short acting insulin analogues can be used, include intensified insulin therapy (short acting insulin before meals, basal insulin at bedtime or twice daily, including adjustment of insulin dose based on carbohydrate intake) or conventional insulin therapy (basal or premixed insulin up to three times daily with or without oral hypoglycaemic agents). Only patients treated with continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) performing intensified insulin therapy regime showed a significant decrease in HbA1c when short acting insulin analogues were used (<LINK REF="STD-Melki-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Melki 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zinman-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Zinman 1997</LINK>). In the case of hypoglycaemic episodes, two published meta-analyses also reported contradictory results with respect to hypoglycaemic episodes (<LINK REF="REF-Brunelle-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brunelle 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Davey-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davey 1997</LINK>). Insulin analogues are more expensive than regular insulin and in the year 2000, Lispro and Aspart had a 30% share of the market for short acting insulins in most developed countries.</P>
<P>Structural homology of insulin analogues to insulin-like-growth-factor-I (IGF-I) has caused concern regarding the progression of diabetic late complications and potential mitogenic (induction of cell division) effects, especially with long-term use of insulin analogues. IGF-I may affect the progression of retinopathy (<LINK REF="REF-Grant-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grant 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-King-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">King 1985</LINK>) and certain modified insulin analogues have shown a carcinogenic effect in the mammary glands in female rats (<LINK REF="REF-J_x00f8_rgensen-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jørgensen 1992</LINK>) or mitogenic potency in osteosarcoma cells (<LINK REF="REF-Kurtzhals-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kurtzhals 2000</LINK>). Despite these potentially adverse properties of insulin analogues, only very limited data on long term safety are currently available, mainly because patients with clinically relevant microvascular complications have been excluded from most clinical studies.</P>

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2008-11-05 12:26:51 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gudrun Paletta">
<P>Trials fulfilling the review inclusion criteria were assessed independently for methodological quality by two reviewers. Interrater agreements were calculated using the kappa-statistic. In cases of disagreement, the rest of the group was consulted and a judgement was made based on consensus. Assessment for methodological quality was done using a modification of the criteria given in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> and the criteria of Schulz and Jadad (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jadad-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jadad 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>(1) Minimisation of selection bias - a) was the randomisation procedure adequate? b) was the allocation concealment adequate?<BR/>(2) Minimisation of performance bias - a) were the patients and people administering the treatment blind to the intervention?<BR/>(3) Minimisation of attrition bias - a) were withdrawals and dropouts completely described? b) was analysis done by intention-to-treat?<BR/>(4) Minimisation of detection bias - a) were outcome assessors blind to the intervention?</P>
<P>Based on these criteria, studies were broadly subdivided into the following three categories (see C<I>ochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I>):<BR/>A - all quality criteria met: low risk of bias;<BR/>B - one or more of the quality criteria only partly met: moderate risk of bias;<BR/>C - one or more criteria not met: high risk of bias.</P>
<P>For the purpose of the analysis in this review, trials were classified into categories according to criteria A, B or C (Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions) (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2005</LINK>) (see also sensitivity analysis below).</P>

<P>Weighted mean differences (WMD) were calculated for the percentage of glycated haemoglobin and a random effects model was used for the meta-analysis.<BR/>We tried to incorporate the two different study designs used, cross-over and parallel studies, into the meta-analysis (<LINK REF="REF-Curtin-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Curtin 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Elbourne-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elbourne 2002</LINK>). To make use of the cross over design, one prerequisite is that the mean difference (or the difference between means) of the treatments is available. In addition, the standard deviation (SD), standard error (SE) or a confidence interval (CI) for the within-person differences must be given. In some of the studies, these estimates were provided whereas for other studies we had to estimate the SE from the test-statistic or from P-values. If no SE for the within-person differences could be extracted from a trial, the correlation between treatment outcomes was approximated using the lowest observed correlation among the other studies (r = 0.69). The robustness of the results was assessed by repeating the analysis using unpaired analyses and a fixed effects model. Heterogeneity between trials was assessed by the<I> </I>&#967;<SUP>2</SUP> -test and small study bias was tested for by a funnel plot and Eggers' test. The WMD was calculated for overall hypoglycaemic episodes per patient per month using unpaired analysis. The number of severe hypoglycaemic episodes per 100 patient-years was computed by dividing the number of severe hypoglycaemic episodes by the years of exposure and then multiplying by 100.</P>

<P>The electronic search using the search strategy described yielded 1529 studies. No additional trials were retrieved through inquiries addressed to EMEA, FDA, MCA and TGA, all three major insulin manufacturing companies and the experts in this field.

<P>After investigation of the abstracts, 1445 articles were excluded by consensus. Reasons for exclusions were: for example no RCTs, narrative reviews, methodology papers of published and ongoing trials, no comparison between analogues and regular insulin, no comparable insulin regimens, non clinical studies, no diabetic patients included in the study. In four articles differences in opinion existed (<LINK REF="REF-Akalin-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Akalin 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kadiri-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kadiri 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ronnemaa-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ronnemaa 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schmauss-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Schmauss 1998</LINK>) and were resolved by a third party.

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Interventions of included studies</HEADING>
<P>Thirty-seven studies used Lispro, 10 used Aspart, one study used Glulisine and one study used Lispro and Aspart as short acting insulin analogues. Duration of intervention ranged from one to 12 months with a mean follow-up of 3.6 months. Approximately 78% of the trials had an initial phase lasting from two weeks to two months in order to achieve stable metabolic conditions. Diagnostic criteria for entry into the study were specified in 84% of trials. Most studies tried to achieve a comparable insulin regimen throughout the investigation period, and treating physicians tried to achieve optimisation of therapy together with their patients, usually by means of flexible insulin therapy in order to achieve metabolic targets of heterogeneously defined 'good control'. One study with cross-over design used a wash out period before switching to the other treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Heller-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Heller 2004</LINK>).</P>

The test of heterogeneity gave a P value of 0.01.<BR/>In the main analysis we incorporated the studies with parallel and crossover design taking into account the two different study designs (<LINK REF="REF-Elbourne-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elbourne 2002</LINK>).<BR/>In 6 of 13 crossover studies paired analysis had to be approximated by assuming correlation of 0.69 between HbA1c values. Sensitivity analyses were performed to assess the impact of the assumed correlation on the outcome of the meta analysis by repeating the analysis ignoring the crossover design and treating the results of the studies as if they had all come from a parallel design. The pooled result using unpaired analyses from each trial was very similar compared to the main analyses (-0.1%; 95% CI -0.2 to -0.1).<BR/>For parallel group trials, only an investigation of the changes from baseline revealed similar results (-0.1%; 95% CI -0.2 to -0.0; heterogeneity was not significant).The funnel plot did not indicate publication bias with Eggers' test yielding non-significant results (P = 0.41).</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2008-11-05 13:29:44 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gudrun Paletta">
<P>This meta-analysis included 49 studies. In adults with type 1 diabetes the analysis resulted in a small, but statistically significant decrease in HbA1c using short acting insulin analogues. In patients with type 2 diabetes no superiority in HbA1c was observed. In terms of overall hypoglycaemia, the results obtained with short acting insulin analogues and regular insulin were comparable.<BR/>The heterogeneous design of the studies, often of poor methodological quality, allows only a cautious interpretation of the results. In addition, only a small percentage of authors submitted the requested original data and therefore the study quality assessment could not be substantially improved after this communication process. Considering only full published trial for this review publication bias can not be excluded.<BR/>In subgroup analyses we found a more pronounced effect on HbA1c in favour of analogues for patients using CSII and for studies with an intervention period longer than 3 months. The almost identical results for trials with Aspart Lispro or Glulisine are in accordance with controlled clinical clamp studies (<LINK REF="REF-Homko-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Homko 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Plank-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Plank 2002</LINK>). In the sensitivity analysis trials with higher quality (B) revealed no improvement for insulin analogues on HbA1c in contrast to trials of lower quality (C).<BR/>No study designed to investigate possible long term effects was found. Therefore, it remains unclear to what extent the effect of improved glycaemic control, which was observed in analogue treatment (overall minus 0.1% HbA1c), affects the development and progression of microvascular complications compared to results obtained with regular insulin.<BR/>In the DCCT over a period of 6.5 years, a decrease in HbA1c of about 2% resulted in an absolute risk reduction in the development of retinopathy of 20% and of 17% in the progression of retinopathy, which yields numbers needed to treat per year of 32 and 39 (<LINK REF="REF-DCCT-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">DCCT 1993</LINK>). Assuming that a reduction in HbA1c with insulin analogues would result in a similar relative benefit, approximately 650 patients would have to be treated with analogues for one year to prevent the development of retinopathy in one patient and approximately 765 patients treated to prevent a single case of progression of diabetic retinopathy. However, in DCCT the beneficial effect of improved glycaemic control on microvascular complications was not seen before three years of treatment.<BR/>For overall hypoglycaemic episodes, the results of our analysis are in line with a previously published meta analysis (<LINK REF="REF-Davey-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davey 1997</LINK>). There were no significant differences in overall hypoglycaemia when analogues were compared with regular insulin. The estimation that an average type 1 diabetic patient experiences from six to eight mild episodes of hypoglycaemia per month (<LINK REF="REF-Pramming-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pramming 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-DCCT-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">DCCT 1991</LINK>) implies that the reduction of hypoglycaemic episodes with analogues was clinically negligible. <BR/>For severe hypoglycaemia, we expressed the numbers of overall episodes per 100 person-years as median and range. Severe hypoglycaemia occurred less often in the analogue group than in the regular group. The wide range of severe hypoglycaemia in IIT studies resulted mostly from the inclusion of one study with a very short duration (<LINK REF="STD-Home-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Home 1998</LINK>). In this study the definition for severe hypoglycaemia was third party help and the inclusion criteria for patients did not differ from the other included studies. The extraordinarily high number of severe hypoglycaemic episodes may have been caused by the use of the strict dosage algorithm for hyper- and hypoglycaemia. However, the interpretation of the results of the frequency of severe hypoglycaemia in the studies is difficult due to inconsistent and bias-prone definitions. Patients may inappropriately deny severe hypoglycaemia, and in this context "third party help" is a soft and variable description of severity; more robust definitions such as "injection of glucose or glucagon by another person" may result in more reliable data (<LINK REF="REF-Muehlhauser-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Muehlhauser 1998</LINK>). Also, based on the available evidence on this topic, it does not seem plausible that the frequency of severe hypoglycaemia can be reduced without a concomitant reduction in the frequency of overall hypoglycaemic episodes (<LINK REF="REF-Cryer-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cryer 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>Thirteen trials reported data on quality of life. Various instruments and open study design hardly allow an objective interpretation of the data reported in type 1 diabetic patients. When the mostly used instrument, the DTSQ, showed significant improvement for analogues, it was mainly due to changes in the convenience, flexibility and continuation of treatment. According to the study protocols in the open label studies patients were advised to inject regular insulin in average 30 minutes before meal. One may hypothesize, the difference in injection time (analogues: immediately versus regular: ~ 30 minutes before meals) is a major underlying reason for treatment satisfaction improvements in analogues. <BR/>Even in daily life most patients seem to use short or even no injection meal interval (<LINK REF="REF-Heinemann-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heinemann 1995</LINK>). The hypothesis of suggesting a time injection interval for intensified insulin therapy is only based on poorly performed trials and never proven on the basis of controlled studies (see comments Chanteleau E). The only study using a double design (<LINK REF="STD-Gale-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Gale 2000</LINK>) did not find an improvement in any quality of life item, metabolic control and overall hypoglycaemia. In type 2 diabetic studies with open label design no difference was observed (<LINK REF="STD-Kotsanos-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Kotsanos 1997</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Ross-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Ross 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>Owing to the maximum observation period of 12 months and the exclusion of patients with clinically relevant microvascular complications, the overall picture with regard to adverse events did not indicate any substantial difference between analogue and regular insulin treatment. Regarding potentially adverse properties, such as mitogenic effects with possible progression of microvascular complications or development of carcinogenic effects under insulin analogue treatment, this meta-analysis cannot provide any further guidance. </P>
<P>The inclusion criteria for further updates of this review will be changed to studies with a treatment duration of at least 24 weeks. This reflects our efforts to emphasise long-term treatment effects on the outcome measures mentioned above.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>Our analysis suggests only a minor clinical benefit of short acting insulin analogues in the majority of diabetic patients treated with insulin. Until long term efficacy and safety data are available, we suggest a cautious response to the vigorous promotion of insulin analogues. </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>For safety purposes, we need a long-term follow-up of large numbers of patients who use short acting insulin analogues. Due to fears of potentially carcinogenic and proliferative effects, most studies to date have excluded patients with advanced diabetic complications. Furthermore, we need well designed studies in pregnant women to determine the safety profile for both the mother and the unborn child. <BR/>For economic analysis, we need to collect cost data in future RCTs. <BR/> </P>

<P>The review concluded that the "patients who received insulin analogues were more satisfied with the treatment mainly due to greater convenience in the timing of injections"(p4).<BR/>This relates to the peculiarity of the study designs of many analog studies: in the control (human insulin) regular groups, an interval of at least 30 minutes was prescribed between injection and meal intake. However, this interval has never been established on the basis of controlled trials, nor has it been based on insulin pharmacokinetics of regular insulin in relation to gastrointestinal physiology (meal carbohydrate absorption).<BR/>Heinemann (1995) has mentioned that many patients do not use a fixed injection-meal- interval of30 min; moreover, many patients adapt the length of an injection-meal-interval to the premeal blood glucose level.<BR/>Papers concerning injection-meal-interval are scarce, e.g. Sackey AH, Jefferson IG: Interval between insulin injection and breakfast in diabetes. Arch Dis Child 1994;71 :248-250. The patients in this study were in twice daily injections of NPH/Regular mixtures; only 2/64 patients were on intensified insulin therapy using regular and long acting insulin separately. As a result, the authors found that before breakfast a prolonged injection-meal-interval was advisable (because of the high prebreakfast blood glucose, due to insufficient insulin dosage during the night). For supper, no such interval was required.<BR/>In another study (Kinmonth AL, Baum ill: Timing of pre-breakfast insulin injection and postprandial metabolic control in diabetic children. Br Med J 1980; i: 604-606) children were investigated on once-daily injection of Monotard + Actrapid before breakfast, starting their day with a pre-breakfast blood glucose of 180 mg/dl! Again, the recommendation to have a 30 min interval between insulin injection and eating is related only to the breakfast meal (there is no other meal tested), is further related to non-intensive insulin therapy, and is not related to the speed of regular insulin absorption (as suggested by the promoters of insulin analogues 25 years later).<BR/>The same holds true for the study by Lean: t\...:1EJ, Ng LL and Tennison BR: Interval between insulin injection and eating in relation to blood glucose control in adult diabetics. Br Med J 1985; i: 105-108. Again the study participants were not giving regular insulin separately from basal insulin, but were using twice daily injections of a mixture of regular and basal (NPH) insulin. The study quality is limited because 225 study patients were studied only by questionnaire, and 11 patients were studied only at breakfast. The latter showed 1 h pp blood glucose increments between 3.5 and 4.9 mmol/L, and corresponding 2h pp blood glucose increments between 0.56-1.88 mmol/L, with injection-meal-intervals between 15 and 45 min. Hence, the author's recommendation that "increasing the interval between insulin injection and eating to 45 minutes would significantly improve control for at least those patients, who currently delay 15 min or less" is unfounded.<BR/>On the contrary, as Orre-Petterson AC, Lindstrom T, Bergmark Vand Arnqvist HJ (The snack is critical for the blood glucose profile during treatment with regular insulin pre-prandially. Journal Intern Med 1999; 245:41-45) have shown, "the recommended interval of30 min between insulin injection and meal may be too long".<BR/>Finally, Schemthaner et al. have recently demonstrated that HbAlc deteriorates when analogues are given postprandially (Diabetic Medicine 2004, published just before the completion of the Siebenhofer-Cochrane review).<BR/>Why has the Nielsen B 10Asp study (Diabetologia 1995) not been quoted: this is the only study on insulin analogs (except for Gale et a1. 2000 ) that has been performed really double blinded without prescribing an injection-meal-interval- there was no greater patient satisfaction with the analogue (neither was it in the Gale study).<BR/>Finally, why has the review on hypoglycaemia by Heinemann (J Diabetes Compl.1999; 13: 105-114) not been quoted? It contains valuable information from hidden sources.</P>
</FEEDBACK_SUMMARY>
<FEEDBACK_REPLY>
<P>Many thanks for your helpful comments on this important topic.</P>
<P>We agree that the comment on "quality of life" in the synopsis is not appropriate and may be misleading for the general reader. There is no conclusive evidence for requirement of different injection intervals when comparing short acting insulin analogues with regular insulin. We now removed this sentence from the synopsis, because there is - as shown in table 3 - only one double blinded study (Gale) which did not find any differences in terms of quality of life. As you suggested, we have included more information on this topic in the discussion section and, for further detailed information for our readers, we used your comprehensive and detailed comment as a reference. </P>
<P>The study published by Nielson B10Asp. was excluded because, as this analogue is not available on the market, this study does not meet our inclusion criteria. </P>
<P>The review published by Heinemann was cross checked during the process of developing the manuscript. However, no additional "full published" paper could be found, and no abstracts were considered for our review.</P>
