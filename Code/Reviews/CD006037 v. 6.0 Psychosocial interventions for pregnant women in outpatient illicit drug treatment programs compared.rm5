<P>
<B>Review question</B>
</P>
<P>We reviewed the evidence about the effect of psychosocial interventions, such as contingency management (CM) and motivational interviewing based (MIB) techniques vs. usual care for pregnant women in outpatient illicit drug treatment programmes.</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>Women who use illicit drugs while pregnant are more likely to give birth early and have low birthweight infants. A pregnant woman can reduce the risk of these complications by undergoing drug treatment during pregnancy.</P>
<P>Psychosocial interventions, such as CM and MIB techniques, may help them to overcome the many barriers to staying in a drug treatment programme and reduce illicit drug use. CM uses positive supportive reinforcement with incentives, such as monetary vouchers, awarded based on pre-determined endpoints such as treatment attendance or drug abstinence. MIB is a form of patient-centred counselling used to resolve uncertainty in their drug use, treatment, or cessation.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>Researchers from the Cochrane Collaboration examined the evidence published up to January 2015 and included 14 studies with 1298 pregnant women in this Cochrane review. The 1298 pregnant women received either CM or MIB techniques in adjunct to other comprehensive care options; women in the control group received usual care that included pharmacological treatment such as methadone maintenance, counselling, prenatal care, STD counselling and testing, transportation, and/or childcare. Nine studies used CM techniques vs. usual care, while five studies involved MIB techniques vs. usual care.</P>
<P>All of the studies were completed in the United States of America and most participants were African American. Most studies used the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV-R) criteria to determine drug dependence.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>There were no differences in retention or abstinence between CM or MIB techniques and usual care. There were also no differences in birth outcomes between the groups.</P>
<P>Overall, there is low to moderate quality of evidence from the included studies. Allocation methods were often described in very limited manner. Furthermore, many studies lacked attrition information which could have impacted results. While further information related to these methods could be helpful, future randomized trials using psychosocial interventions are unlikely to show a benefit. In addition, there was significant heterogeneity in terms of methods for measuring outcomes.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2015-03-12 11:17:41 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Illicit drug use in pregnancy is a complex social and public health problem. The consequences of drug use in pregnancy are high for both the woman and her child. Therefore, it is important to develop and evaluate effective treatments. There is evidence for the effectiveness of psychosocial interventions in drug treatment but it is unclear whether they are effective in pregnant women. This is an update of a Cochrane review originally published in 2007.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2015-03-16 11:46:55 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>To evaluate the effectiveness of psychosocial interventions in pregnant women enrolled in illicit drug treatment programmes on birth and neonatal outcomes, on attendance and retention in treatment, as well as on maternal and neonatal drug abstinence. In short, do psychosocial interventions translate into less illicit drug use, greater abstinence, better birth outcomes, or greater clinic attendance?</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2015-03-16 12:28:46 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We conducted the original literature search in May 2006 and performed the search update up to January 2015. For both review stages (original and update), we searched the Cochrane Drugs and Alcohol Group Trial's register (May 2006 and January 2015); the Cochrane Central Register of Trials (CENTRAL; the Cochrane Library 2015, Issue 1); PubMed (1996 to January 2015); EMBASE (1996 to January 2015); and CINAHL (1982 to January 2015).</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2015-03-12 11:18:10 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included randomized controlled trials comparing any psychosocial intervention vs. a control intervention that could include pharmacological treatment, such as methadone maintenance, a different psychosocial intervention, counselling, prenatal care, STD counselling and testing, transportation, or childcare.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2015-03-12 11:18:16 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We used standard methodological procedures expected by the Cochrane Collaboration. We performed analyses based on three comparisons: any psychosocial intervention vs. control, contingency management (CM) interventions vs. control, and motivational interviewing based (MIB) interventions vs. control.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-03-23 00:11:41 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In total, we included 14 studies with 1298 participants: nine studies (704 participants) compared CM vs. control, and five studies (594 participants) compared MIB interventions vs. control. We did not find any studies that assessed other types of psychosocial interventions. For the most part, it was unclear if included studies adequately controlled for biases within their studies as such information was not often reported. We assessed risk of bias in the included studies relating to participant selection, allocation concealment, personnel and outcome assessor blinding, and attrition.</P>
<P>The included trials rarely captured maternal and neonatal outcomes. For studies that did measure such outcomes, no difference was observed in pre-term birth rates (RR 0.71, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.34 to 1.51; three trials, 264 participants, <I>moderate quality evidence</I>), maternal toxicity at delivery (RR 1.18, 95% CI 0.52 to 2.65; two trials, 217 participants, <I>moderate quality evidence</I>), or low birth weight (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.36 to 1.43; one trial, 160 participants, <I>moderate quality evidence</I>). However, the results did show that neonates remained in hospital for fewer days after delivery in CM intervention groups (RR -1.27, 95% CI -2.52 to -0.03; two trials, 103 participants, <I>moderate quality evidence</I>). There were no differences observed at the end of studies in retention or abstinence (as assessed by positive drug test at the end of treatment) in any psychosocial intervention group compared to control (Retention: RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.06, nine trials, 743 participants, <I>low quality evidence</I>; and Abstinence: RR 1.14, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.73, three trials, 367 participants, <I>low quality evidence</I>). These results held for both CM and MIB combined. Overall, the quality of the evidence was low to moderate.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2015-03-23 00:13:03 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The present evidence suggests that there is no difference in treatment outcomes to address drug use in pregnant women with use of psychosocial interventions, when taken in the presence of other comprehensive care options. However, few studies evaluated obstetrical or neonatal outcomes and rarely did so in a systematic way, making it difficult to assess the effect of psychosocial interventions on these clinically important outcomes. It is important to develop a better evidence base to evaluate psychosocial modalities of treatment in this important population.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2015-03-12 11:19:31 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Illicit drug use among pregnant women is an important and complex public health concern. Since the early 1990s, there has been a gradual increase in the incidence of illicit drug use in the United States of America (USA), especially among women of reproductive age (http://oas.samhsa.gov/women.htm). The most current data in the USA is from the 2012 National Survey on Drug Use and Health (http://oas.samhsa.gov/nhsda), in which 5.9% of pregnant women reported current illicit drug use. Furthermore, the data showed that 18.3% of pregnant women aged 15 to 17, 9.0% of women aged 18 to 25, and 3.4% of women aged 26 to 44 were current users of illicit drugs. A 2010 Australian survey also found that 4.2% of women who were pregnant, breastfeeding, or both in the past 12 months had used an illicit drug while pregnant (<LINK REF="REF-AIHW-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">AIHW 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>Women who use illicit drugs are more likely to experience adverse obstetrical and perinatal outcomes than women in the general population (<LINK REF="REF-Ludlow-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ludlow 2004</LINK>). Illicit drug use in pregnancy has been associated with preterm delivery, low birth weight infants, placental abruption, neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS), and Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) admission (<LINK REF="REF-Sherwood-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sherwood 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ludlow-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ludlow 2004</LINK>). Cocaine, amphetamines, opioids, and marijuana use has been linked to premature labour, placental abruption, uterine rupture, fetal distress, neonatal addiction syndrome, and delay in cognitive development (<LINK REF="REF-Kuczkowski-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kuczkowski 2007</LINK>). There is also conflicting evidence on long term adverse outcomes, especially among cocaine exposed infants. Although some studies have shown cognitive deficits at two years of life (<LINK REF="REF-Singer-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Singer 2004</LINK>), the bulk of the research points to minimal or absent effects in early childhood, as summarized well in a systematic review (<LINK REF="REF-Frank-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Frank 2001</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2015-03-12 11:19:40 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Drug treatment interventions can be grouped into either pharmacological or psychosocial methods. This Cochrane review focuses only on psychosocial interventions, which involve the use of contingency management (CM) methods, including vouchers and other incentives, as well as manual-based techniques such as motivational interviewing based (MIB) techniques. There are additional psychosocial interventions including cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) and individual psychotherapy. We focused on CM and MIB techniques because they are the most common.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Contingency management</HEADING>
<P>CM treatments are based on the principle of positive reinforcement as a means of operant conditioning that influences behaviour change. It is grounded in the work of Thorndike, especially in his "Law of Effect", which states that behavioural responses which produce a "satisfying" effect are "stamped in" by the experience and likely to occur more frequently than responses which produce an "annoying" effect (<LINK REF="REF-Thorndike-1898" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thorndike 1898</LINK>). This theory was elaborated by B.F. Skinner who examined the relationship between positive vs. negative reinforcement and positive vs. negative punishment in relation to behavioural outcome. Like Thorndike, his research (initially) involved the use of animals (a pigeon in a box rather than a cat in a maze). He demonstrated that punishment, regardless of whether positive or negative, decreases behaviour whereas reinforcement increases behaviour, and he attempted to describe the psycho-dynamic mechanism by which this behaviour change was affected (<LINK REF="REF-Skinner-1947" TYPE="REFERENCE">Skinner 1947</LINK>). The premise behind CM is to systematically use reinforcement techniques to modify behaviour in a positive and supportive manner. It has been used in the treatment of substance abuse since the 1970s (for a good review see <LINK REF="REF-Sitzer-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sitzer 2006</LINK>). The most common form of CM has been the use of monetary vouchers, although prize reinforcers have also been used. CM was first demonstrated to be efficacious in both treatment retention and substance abstinence in cocaine-dependent individuals (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 1991</LINK>), but has subsequently been studied in opioids, marijuana, cigarettes, alcohol, benzodiazepines, and multiple drugs. Recently it has been used in populations of pregnant illicit drug-dependent women.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Motivational interviewing based</HEADING>
<P>MIB techniques are cognitive-behavioural interventions that are standardized and reproducible. They are based on motivational interviewing, a concept initially developed for the treatment of problem drinkers (<LINK REF="REF-Miller-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Miller 2003</LINK>). It is a directive, client-centred counselling style for eliciting behaviour change by helping clients explore and resolve the ambivalence surrounding their substance use (<LINK REF="REF-Rollnick-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rollnick 1995</LINK>). It draws from the trans-theoretical model of change (<LINK REF="REF-DiClemente-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">DiClemente 1998</LINK>) in order to improve treatment readiness and retention. The four included trials each employed a relatively brief MIB intervention. In <LINK REF="STD-Mullins-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Mullins 2004</LINK>, participants in the intervention group received three one-hour MIB sessions. In <LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Neill-1996" TYPE="STUDY">O'Neill 1996</LINK>, the participants received a total of six sessions lasting 60 to 90 minutes each. The first session was MIB, whereas the subsequent sessions addressed strategies for avoiding high risk behaviours, including relaxation techniques and problem-solving techniques. In <LINK REF="STD-Haug-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Haug 2004</LINK>, the most standardized form of MIB was employed: motivational enhancement therapy (MET). This involved four sessions each tailored to the person's stage of change. <LINK REF="STD-Winhusen-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Winhusen 2008</LINK> employed three sessions, the first of which emphasized rapport building, reflective listening, and affirmation. The second session focused on providing feedback to the patient and a discussion of the benefits and consequences of substance use and pregnancy. The final session centred on either planning for behaviour change or strengthening commitment to behaviour change.</P>

<THEORY MODIFIED="2015-03-22 23:42:04 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Drug treatment in pregnancy has been shown to reduce the maternal and fetal complications associated with illicit drug use (<LINK REF="STD-Kukko-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Kukko 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Armstrong-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Armstrong 2003</LINK>). Pregnancy can be considered as a "window of opportunity" for drug treatment intervention (<LINK REF="REF-Daley-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Daley 1998</LINK>). Maternal concern for the pregnancy has been thought of as a motivator to seek drug treatment. Although qualitative studies have documented maternal motivation (<LINK REF="REF-Murphy-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Murphy 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Dakof-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dakof 2003</LINK>), they have also described the many structural and social barriers to both receiving and remaining in treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Boyd-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boyd 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Murphy-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Murphy 1999</LINK>). To date, empirical research has failed to demonstrate better adherence rates to treatment among pregnant women compared with other people in drug treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Hser-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hser 1998</LINK>). In fact, pregnant women may have higher dropout rates (<LINK REF="REF-Howell-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Howell 2000</LINK>). Since length of time in treatment is related to positive outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-Grella-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grella 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Howell-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Howell 2000</LINK>), it is important to identify modalities of treatment retention that are successful in this specific population. Psychosocial interventions can increase individual motivation to remain in treatment and decrease drug use through the use of incentives, or therapeutic techniques, or both (<LINK REF="REF-Amato-2011a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Amato 2011a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Amato-2011b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Amato 2011b</LINK>)</P>

<P>The consequences of drug use in pregnancy are great for both the woman and her child (<LINK REF="REF-Ludlow-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ludlow 2004</LINK>).

As no other systematic reviews have been done on this subject since the first version of this Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-Terplan-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Terplan 2007</LINK>), this update provides a valuable re-evaluation of the effect of such interventions in this important population.</P>

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2015-03-16 12:24:05 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We performed the 'Risk of bias' assessment for included RCTs and CCTs using the criteria recommended by the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). The 'Risk of bias' tool for assessing risk of bias in included studies is a two-part tool, addressing seven specific domains, namely: sequence generation and allocation concealment (selection bias), blinding of participants and providers (performance bias), blinding of outcome assessor (detection bias), incomplete outcome data (attrition bias), selective outcome reporting (reporting bias), and other sources of bias. The first part of the tool involves describing what was reported to have happened in the study. The second part of the tool involves assigning a judgement relating to the risk of bias for that entry, in terms of either low, high, or unclear risk. We used the criteria indicated by the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> adapted to the addiction field.</P>
<P>We assessed the domains of sequence generation and allocation concealment (avoidance of selection bias) using the 'Risk of bias' tool by a single entry for each study.</P>
<P>We considered blinding of participants, personnel and outcome assessor (avoidance of performance bias and detection bias) separately for objective outcomes (e.g. drop out, use of substance of abuse measured by urine-analysis, subjects relapsed at the end of follow-up, subjects engaged in further treatments) and subjective outcomes (e.g. duration and severity of signs and symptoms of withdrawal, patient self-reported use of substance, side effects, social functioning as integration at school or at work, family relationship). Blinding of participants and personnel was generally not feasible given the type of intervention, so we did not consider this item. In addition, we assessed detection bias based on blinding of outcome assessors.</P>
<P>Incomplete outcome data (avoidance of attrition bias) was considered for all outcomes except for drop out from the treatment, which is very often the primary outcome measure in trials on addiction. We also considered whether exclusion criteria could be a source of bias and if intention-to-treat analysis was used.<I>

In <LINK REF="STD-Silverman-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Silverman 2001</LINK>, the concept of abstinent reinforcement contingencies were integrated into an employment setting referred to as the Therapeutic Workplace. The participants received work and salary only when they remained abstinent. For <LINK REF="STD-Jones-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Jones 2011</LINK>, CM methods were applied to housing. A key piece of the treatment plan in this study involved abstinence-contingent housing.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-03-12 11:46:08 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included 14 RCTs, nine that employed a form of CM and five that used a manual-based intervention, namely MIB techniques. We did not identify any trials that assessed other types of psychosocial interventions. All interventions were compared with varied comprehensive usual care control.</P>
<P>Our main interest was in both obstetrical and neonatal outcomes of treatment. Illicit drug use is associated with a myriad of complications for both the pregnant woman and her newborn. These complications are costly and identifying a means of reducing their prevalence would be beneficial. Unfortunately, the included RCTs rarely reported on obstetrical or neonatal outcomes. Furthermore, four trials listed obstetrical events, such as early delivery and miscarriage, as exclusion criteria. Only four trials reported birth outcomes (<LINK REF="STD-Carroll-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Carroll 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Elk-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Elk 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jones-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Jones 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yonkers-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Yonkers 2012</LINK>). The three CM trials showed a benefit with intervention. There was also inconsistency between the studies with regards to the obstetrical outcomes measured. <LINK REF="STD-Carroll-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Carroll 1995</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Jones-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Jones 2011</LINK> measured both mean gestational age and mean birth weight. However, <LINK REF="STD-Elk-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Elk 1998</LINK> counted "adverse perinatal events", a category that included both preterm delivery, a serious obstetrical event, as well as preterm labour, a clinical event of far less significance.</P>
<P>Eleven included trials reported continued illicit drug use, as measured primarily by urine toxicology. All trials had abstinence as a goal of treatment except <LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Neill-1996" TYPE="STUDY">O'Neill 1996</LINK> which employed a harm reduction model. This was also the only study which relied exclusively on client self-report to assess continued drug use. The frequency of urine sampling varied between studies, as did the methods of reporting the results. It was often unclear how the summary proportions had been generated and, with the exception of <LINK REF="STD-Elk-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Elk 1998</LINK>, none mentioned statistical adjustment for multiple testing. Overall, there appears to be little evidence that psychosocial interventions reduce continued illicit drug use in pregnant women enrolled in drug treatment. None of the trials that employed MIB techniques reported an effect of the intervention on drug abstinence. Of the two RCTs that reported an effect, both employed CM. However, the magnitude of the reduction was difficult to assess (<LINK REF="STD-Silverman-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Silverman 2001</LINK>), and its effect was small and temporary (<LINK REF="STD-Jones-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Jones 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>A primary goal of CM is to alter, if not to eliminate, drug use behaviours. Over the last decade, the clinical evidence demonstrating CM efficacy in reinforcing drug abstinence has been established (for a good summary see <LINK REF="REF-Sitzer-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sitzer 2006</LINK>). This Cochrane review is the first to specifically address drug treatment in pregnancy. It appears that the benefits of CM on drug abstinence are not as profound in pregnant women as in the general population of people in drug treatment. MIB methods in contradistinction have not been shown to have consistent effects on subsequent abstinence (<LINK REF="REF-Miller-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Miller 2003</LINK>) in drug treatment. Similarly, our results show no benefit of MI in pregnancy, with a trend towards a negative effect.</P>
<P>Included trials reported retention in treatment most consistently of all outcomes. As with any surrogate outcome, its clinical utility is dependent upon the evidence of it as an intermediary to the important clinical outcome (<LINK REF="REF-Grimes-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grimes 2005</LINK>). In pregnancy, attendance in drug treatment has been shown to lead to increase birth weight, increase in one minute Apgars, and overall lower costs (<LINK REF="REF-Hubbard-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hubbard 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McCaul-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">McCaul 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Svikis-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Svikis 1998</LINK>). We found no difference in treatment retention either by CM or MIB techniques. Psychosocial interventions, either CM or MIB, did not improve treatment retention.</P>
<P>Overall, our Cochrane review identified few experimental studies of psychosocial interventions in pregnancy for illicit drug use. This is surprising given the wide use of such interventions in clinical treatment. Furthermore, it is unlikely that manual based interventions, such as MI, are used in isolation in clinical practice. Counsellors most likely use different parts of multiple modalities simultaneously. Even if a particular psychosocial intervention is found to be beneficial, its application may be limited by the realities of drug treatment.</P>
<P>It is important to note that sites where these psychosocial treatments were delivered also included supplementary services for both the experimental and control groups, including child care services, transportation, and housing. These additional services are likely to have contributed an overall effect to drug treatment outcomes, hence the differential contribution of the psychosocial intervention might have been difficult to observe. The drug treatment locations from where this review's data were obtained are likely more comprehensive than standard drug treatment centres that enrol pregnant women. We cannot assess whether psychosocial interventions in the absence of these additional services are beneficial to pregnant women.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2015-03-12 11:46:21 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There were several limitations of the included RCTs. Overall trials were heterogeneous, differing in the details of both the intervention and the control, and employing different lengths of treatment. Some studies were quite small and likely underpowered, especially for obstetrical outcomes. The study settings were all similar (academic specialist drug dependence units primarily in the USA), as were the included participants. Although this decreases heterogeneity between trials, the results of this review may not be generalizable to other settings.</P>
<P>One of the limitations to CM is the cost. On average, CM participants in the included trials cost up to $1364 per client (<LINK REF="STD-Tuten-2012a" TYPE="STUDY">Tuten 2012a</LINK>). Clearly this limits the applicability of CM on a large scale. For this reason non-cash incentives, such as vouchers, have been used. <LINK REF="STD-Silverman-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Silverman 2001</LINK> extended this concept to include job training.</P>
<P>It is important to acknowledge that many pregnant women are referred to drug treatment from the criminal justice system (<LINK REF="REF-Terplan-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Terplan 2010</LINK>). Unfortunately, no included trials discussed the referral pattern of their respective patient populations. Manual based interventions, such as MI, are likely less effective among coerced people. In fact, they may be counterproductive. Actively engaging a pregnant woman before she is ready to change may be detrimental, especially when the intervention involves MIB techniques (<LINK REF="REF-Hettema-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hettema 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>It is also important to note the characteristics of the included participants. The patients were overwhelmingly unemployed, poor, African American, and with low education levels. This limits the generalizability of the study results. The population of women who use illicit drugs in pregnancy is different from those enrolled in drug treatment, which differs from the population of women in treatment who participate in experimental trials. In general, the efficacy of psychosocial interventions may vary between these different patient subsets.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2015-03-12 11:46:41 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The quality of reporting in the included studies was very poor so that for most items and studies a judgment of unclear risk of bias was given. A recurring issue was an observed heterogeneity between the included trials in terms of outcomes measurements. For example, trials measured urine toxicology differently (and at different time points). Similarly, retention in treatment definitions varied and were assessed at different time points between studies. See also <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>.</P>

<P>The data extraction and input process were consensus driven and several review authors verified this independently. We believe that we identified all relevant studies as we searched the grey literature, and contacted trial authors and field experts. However, we were unable to obtain additional data from some trial authors which would have enriched analysis of neonatal and urine toxicology outcomes. Given the absence of any effect of the interventions on retention or urine toxicology, it is unlikely that these additional data would have changed our summary meta-analysis.</P>

<P>In conclusion, psychosocial interventions when taken in the presence of other comprehensive care options do not translate into better neonatal or obstetrical outcomes, nor are they associated with greater illicit drug abstinence or increased treatment retention among pregnant women. The included trials rarely captured maternal and neonatal outcomes and there was no data on cost benefit. Though psychosocial interventions were found to reduce days neonates were hospitalized after delivery, it is unclear if this observation is reflective of real effect or delivery practices. Therefore, there is insufficient evidence to evaluate the effect of psychosocial interventions on birth or neonatal outcomes among pregnant women in treatment. Overall, the current quality of evidence was low to moderate and future studies should measure these outcomes systematically.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2015-03-12 11:47:12 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Large RCTs with obstetrically meaningful endpoints and longer follow-up times are required to examine whether psychosocial interventions help pregnant women with illicit drug dependence. Poor obstetrical outcomes should not be exclusion criteria to study participation, as these events are essential to capture as they may be related to illicit drug use. Ideally these studies should have multiple sites in order to capture a greater diversity of study patients which would increase the generalizability of the findings. The reporting of criminal justice referral into treatment is especially important, as the efficacy of psychosocial interventions may be different between people who have been coerced into treatment and those who enter voluntarily.</P>
<P>Questions that should be considered include:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Is one psychosocial intervention more effective than another?</LI>
<LI>What covariate, such as drug use history, time in treatment, or gestational age upon enrolment, are associated with treatment effectiveness?</LI>
<LI>What is the optimal reimbursement for CM and its overall cost effectiveness?</LI>
</UL>
<P>Overall the trials should state clearly the method of randomization and allocation concealment. Although blinding of participants is impossible, those assessing outcomes and performing the analyses should be blinded (and this should be clearly stated). Intention to treat (ITT) analysis should be performed and power calculations used a priori.</P>

<P>For the original search executed in May 2006, we searched the Cochrane Drugs and Alcohol Group Register (May 2006); CENTEAL, (The Cochrane Library, Issue 3, 2005); MEDLINE (1996 to August 2006); EMBASE (January 1996 to August 2006); and CINAHL (January 1982 to August 2006). We followed the 'optimal' MEDLINE and EMBASE sensitive search strategies devised by the Cochrane Collaboration for RCTs as published in Section 6.4 of the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>) in order to identify studies relevant to this Cochrane review.</P>
