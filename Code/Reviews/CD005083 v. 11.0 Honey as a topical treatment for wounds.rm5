<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2015-02-09 02:19:51 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="Nicky Cullum">
<P>We reviewed the evidence about the effects of applying honey on the healing of any kind of wound. We found 26 studies involving 3011 people with many different kinds of wounds. Honey was compared with many different treatments in the included studies.</P>
<P>The differences in wound types and comparators make it impossible to draw overall conclusions about the effects of honey on wound healing. The evidence for most comparisons is low or very low quality. This was largely because we thought that problems with the design of some of the studies made their results unreliable and for many outcomes there was only a small amount of information available. In some cases the results of the studies varied considerably.</P>
<P>There is high quality evidence that honey heals partial thickness burns around 4 to 5 days more quickly than conventional dressings. There is moderate quality evidence that honey is more effective than antiseptic followed by gauze for healing wounds infected after surgical operations.</P>
<P>It is not clear if honey is better or worse than other treatments for burns, mixed acute and chronic wounds, pressure ulcers, Fournier's gangrene, venous leg ulcers, minor acute wounds, diabetic foot ulcers and Leishmaniasis as most of the evidence that exists is of low or very low quality.</P>
<P>This evidence is current up to October 2014.</P>

<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2015-02-10 02:56:30 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="Nicky Cullum">
<P>The objective of this review was to assess the effects of honey compared with alternative wound dressings and topical treatments on the of healing of acute (e.g. burns, lacerations) and/or chronic (e.g. venous ulcers) wounds.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2014-11-14 22:39:25 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="Nicky Cullum">
<P>For this update of the review we searched the Cochrane Wounds Group Specialised Register (searched 15 October 2014); The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (<I>The Cochrane Library</I> 2014, Issue 9); Ovid MEDLINE (1946 to October Week 1 2014); Ovid MEDLINE (In-Process &amp; Other Non-Indexed Citations 13 October 2014); Ovid EMBASE (1974 to 13 October 2014); and EBSCO CINAHL (1982 to 15 October 2014).</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2015-02-10 02:25:17 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Randomised and quasi-randomised trials that evaluated honey as a treatment for any sort of acute or chronic wound were sought. There was no restriction in terms of source, date of publication or language. Wound healing was the primary endpoint.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2014-11-22 01:39:22 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="Nicky Cullum">
<P>Data from eligible trials were extracted and summarised by one review author, using a data extraction sheet, and independently verified by a second review author. All data have been subsequently checked by two more authors.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-02-14 04:25:27 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="Nicky Cullum">
<P>We identified 26 eligible trials (total of 3011 participants). Three trials evaluated the effects of honey in minor acute wounds, 11 trials evaluated honey in burns, 10 trials recruited people with different chronic wounds including two in people with venous leg ulcers, two trials in people with diabetic foot ulcers and single trials in infected post-operative wounds, pressure injuries, cutaneous Leishmaniasis and Fournier's gangrene. Two trials recruited a mixed population of people with acute and chronic wounds. The quality of the evidence varied between different comparisons and outcomes. We mainly downgraded the quality of evidence for risk of bias, imprecision and, in a few cases, inconsistency.</P>
<P>There is high quality evidence (2 trials, n=992) that honey dressings heal partial thickness burns more quickly than conventional dressings (WMD -4.68 days, 95%CI -5.09 to -4.28) but it is unclear if there is a difference in rates of adverse events (very low quality evidence) or infection (low quality evidence).</P>
<P>There is very low quality evidence (4 trials, n=332) that burns treated with honey heal more quickly than those treated with silver sulfadiazine (SSD) (WMD -5.12 days, 95%CI -9.51 to -0.73) and high quality evidence from 6 trials (n=462) that there is no difference in overall risk of healing within 6 weeks for honey compared with SSD (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.02) but a reduction in the overall risk of adverse events with honey relative to SSD. There is low quality evidence (1 trial, n=50) that early excision and grafting heals partial and full thickness burns more quickly than honey followed by grafting as necessary (WMD 13.6 days, 95%CI 9.82 to 17.38).</P>
<P>There is low quality evidence (2 trials, different comparators, n=140) that honey heals a mixed population of acute and chronic wounds more quickly than SSD or sugar dressings.</P>
<P>Honey healed infected post-operative wounds more quickly than antiseptic washes followed by gauze and was associated with fewer adverse events (1 trial, n=50, moderate quality evidence, RR of healing 1.69, 95%CI 1.10 to 2.61); healed pressure ulcers more quickly than saline soaks (1 trial, n= 40, very low quality evidence, RR 1.41, 95%CI 1.05 to 1.90), and healed Fournier&#8217;s gangrene more quickly than Eusol soaks (1 trial, n=30, very low quality evidence, WMD -8.00 days, 95%CI -6.08 to -9.92 days).</P>
<P>The effects of honey relative to comparators are unclear for: venous leg ulcers (2 trials, n= 476, low quality evidence); minor acute wounds (3 trials, n=213, very low quality evidence); diabetic foot ulcers (2 trials, n=93, low quality evidence); Leishmaniasis (1 trial, n=100, low quality evidence); mixed chronic wounds (2 trials, n=150, low quality evidence).</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2015-02-10 22:16:31 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>It is difficult to draw overall conclusions regarding the effects of honey as a topical treatment for wounds due to the heterogeneous nature of the patient populations and comparators studied and the mostly low quality of the evidence. The quality of the evidence was mainly downgraded for risk of bias and imprecision. Honey appears to heal partial thickness burns more quickly than conventional treatment (which included polyurethane film, paraffin gauze, soframycin-impregnated gauze, sterile linen and leaving the burns exposed) and infected post-operative wounds more quickly than antiseptics and gauze. Beyond these comparisons any evidence for differences in the effects of honey and comparators is of low or very low quality and does not form a robust basis for decision making.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2014-11-26 12:09:11 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="Nicky Cullum">
<P>Acute and chronic wounds are terms in regular use in clinical practice, yet definition of these terms has received little attention. <LINK REF="REF-Lazarus-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lazarus 1994</LINK> suggested acute wounds proceed through to healing "in an orderly and timely reparative process". Orderliness refers to the healing sequence of inflammation, angiogenesis, matrix deposition, wound contraction, epithelialisation, and scar remodelling. Timeliness is subjective, but refers to a healing time that could be reasonably expected. A chronic wound is, therefore, a wound where the orderly biological progression to healing has been disrupted and healing is delayed.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2012-07-11 02:52:43 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Honey is a viscous, supersaturated sugar solution derived from nectar gathered and modified by the honeybee, <I>Apis mellifera</I>. Honey contains approximately 30% glucose, 40% fructose, 5% sucrose, and 20% water, as well as many other substances, such as amino acids, vitamins, minerals and enzymes (<LINK REF="REF-Sato-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sato 2000</LINK>). Honey has been used in wound care since ancient times and is frequently mentioned in early pharmacopeia, although more usually as an ingredient or carrier vehicle rather than a specific treatment. Dioscorides (40-80 CE) often mentioned honey as a vehicle for carrying therapeutic agents in <I>de materia medicis</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Riddle-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Riddle 1985</LINK>), and Hippocrates (460-377 BCE), who is often cited as advocating honey for wound care, simply listed it as one of many ingredients in a multitude of unguents (<LINK REF="REF-Adams-1939" TYPE="REFERENCE">Adams 1939</LINK>). Probably the first deliberate advocacy of honey as a wound treatment was by the anonymous author of the Edwin Smith papyrus, an Egyptian surgical text written between 2600-2200 BCE (<LINK REF="REF-Breasted-1930" TYPE="REFERENCE">Breasted 1930</LINK>). A dressing made from honey and plant material was also recommended for treating burns in the London Medical Papyrus written around 1325 BCE (<LINK REF="REF-Trevisanato-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Trevisanato 2006</LINK>). Other early medical customs, including Ayurvedic (<LINK REF="REF-Johnson-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnson 1992</LINK>), Chinese (<LINK REF="REF-Fu-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fu 2001</LINK>) and Roman traditions (<LINK REF="REF-Hajar-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hajar 2002</LINK>), also used honey in wound care.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2014-10-10 03:12:14 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="Nicky Cullum">
<P>Between 1996 and 2006 there was a surge in interest about honey as a wound treatment, with 40 case reports or series in 875 patients published (<LINK REF="STD-Jull-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Jull 2008</LINK>). Recent research has tended to concentrate on the antibacterial activity of the many different types of honey, rather than its effect on wound healing (<LINK REF="REF-Molan-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Molan 1999</LINK>). Manuka honey, a monofloral honey derived from the <I>Leptospermum</I> tree in New Zealand and Australia, has been of particular interest, as it has antibacterial activity independent of the effect of honey's peroxide activity and osmolarity (<LINK REF="REF-Molan-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Molan 2001</LINK>). The substance (or substances) responsible for this non-peroxide activity has not been definitively identified, but has been termed Unique Manuka Factor (UMF). Manuka honey with a UMF rating has an antibacterial activity equivalent to a similar percentage of phenolic acid in solution. Recent research suggests methylglyoxal is the substance responsible for the non-peroxide activity (<LINK REF="REF-Mavric-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mavric 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>There is evidence from different animal models that honey may accelerate healing (<LINK REF="REF-Bergman-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bergman 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Oryan-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oryan 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Postmes-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Postmes 1997</LINK>). Fifteen of the 16 controlled trials in five different animal models (mice, rat, rabbit, pig, and buffalo calf) found that honey-treated incisional and excisional wounds, and standard burns, healed faster than control wounds (<LINK REF="STD-Jull-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Jull 2008</LINK>). In addition, a systematic review of honey as a wound dressing found seven randomised trials in humans, six in burns patients and one in infected post-operative wounds (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2001</LINK>). Although the poor quality of the trial reports prevented any recommendations, the findings did suggest an effect in favour of honey.</P>
<P>Honey may exert multiple microscopic actions on wounds. It appears to draw fluid from the underlying circulation, providing both a moist environment and topical nutrition that may enhance tissue growth (<LINK REF="REF-Molan-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Molan 1999</LINK>). Histologically, honey appears to stimulate tissue growth in animal and human controlled trials, with earlier tissue repair noted (<LINK REF="REF-Bergman-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bergman 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Subrahmanyam-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Subrahmanyam 1998</LINK>), fewer inflammatory changes (<LINK REF="REF-Oryan-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oryan 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Postmes-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Postmes 1997</LINK>), and improved epithelialisation (<LINK REF="REF-Oryan-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oryan 1998</LINK>).

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2015-02-18 01:16:12 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>For the first update, one review author (SD) assessed each included study using the Cochrane Collaboration tool for assessing risk of bias (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>), and this assessment was checked by a second (AJ) review author. For this second update two more pairs of review authors/editors checked risk of bias (either MW and JD or JD and NC) and reviewed by the lead review author (AJ). This tool addresses six specific domains, namely sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding, incomplete outcome data, selective outcome reporting and other issues, such as extreme baseline imbalance (see <LINK REF="APP-03" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 3</LINK> for details of criteria on which the judgement was based). Blinding and completeness of outcome data were assessed for each outcome separately. We completed a risk of bias table for each eligible study and discussed any disagreement amongst all review authors to achieve a consensus.</P>
<P>We present an assessment of risk of bias using a 'risk of bias summary figure', which presents all of the judgements in a cross-tabulation of study by entry. This display of internal validity indicates the weight the reader may give the results of each study.</P>

<DATA_SYNTHESIS MODIFIED="2015-02-18 01:16:34 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Where trials were sufficiently alike in terms of population and comparison interventions, their results were combined. Mean differences (MD) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were reported for continuous outcomes, and risk ratio (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were reported for dichotomous variables. Statistical heterogeneity was tested by comparing Cochran's Q statistic and the chi-squared distribution. Heterogeneity was assumed with P values of less than 0.1 (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). In addition, the I<SUP>
<I>2</I>
</SUP> statistic was used to determine the percentage of variation due to heterogeneity rather than chance (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2003</LINK>), and any sources of heterogeneity were explored. Where significant statistical heterogeneity was present, a random-effects model was used when combining trials (<LINK REF="REF-Ioannidis-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ioannidis 2008</LINK>).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Summary of findings</HEADING>
<P>The evidence was summarised in summary of findings tables using the approach of the Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation Working Group (GRADE Working Group) (<LINK REF="REF-Langendam-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Langendam 2013</LINK>). This approach assesses the quality of the body of evidence per comparison and outcome, taking into account five factors: risk of bias across all studies reporting that outcome; indirectness of population, interventions and outcomes, across all studies reporting the outcome; inconsistency amongst studies; imprecision (taking into account the optimum information size and the confidence intervals) and publication bias. The results are reported below according to condition, comparison and outcome and then the different outcomes are brought together in summary of findings tables (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>; <LINK REF="SOF-02" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 2</LINK>; <LINK REF="SOF-03" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 3</LINK>; <LINK REF="SOF-04" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 4</LINK>), which are discussed in the final section (<LINK TAG="DISCUSSION" TYPE="SECTION">Discussion</LINK>).</P>

In the adjunct trials, the comparators were either other dressings plus compression (<LINK REF="STD-Gethin-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Gethin 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gulati-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Gulati 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jull-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Jull 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Robson-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Robson 2009</LINK>) or glucantamine injection alone (<LINK REF="STD-Nilforoushzadeh-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Nilforoushzadeh 2007</LINK>). The comparator for the trial giving honey plus delayed skin grafting was early tangential excision and skin grafting (<LINK REF="STD-Subrahmanyam-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Subrahmanyam 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>In view of the clinical diversity of the evidence, this review is organised by wound type, and then by comparison type.</P>
<P>There was a great deal of variation in the outcomes reported by the included studies which makes the drawing of overall conclusions very difficult. Many of the included studies report "mean time to healing" but it was frequently not clear whether every participant's wound had healed during follow up (in which case the mean time with associated SD or 95% confidence interval would be acceptable). However if all wounds in a study do not heal during the period of observation, simple calculation of the mean (or median) time to healing without accounting for censoring is inappropriate since, by definition, this approach excludes people who did not heal during follow up (as they cannot contribute to the numerator). Importantly excluding people who failed to heal from the data excludes treatment failures and will over-estimate treatment success. Time to healing is a type of "time to event" outcome and should be analysed as such using a survival approach which allows people who did not heal to contribute data to the analysis for the period for which they were observed. Only three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Jull-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Jull 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nilforoushzadeh-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Nilforoushzadeh 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Robson-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Robson 2009</LINK>) analysed time to healing as time to event data. One study (<LINK REF="STD-Shukrimi-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Shukrimi 2008</LINK>) reported time to readiness for wound closure surgery.</P>
<P>The multiplicity of time points at which healing was reported was a further problem which had not been anticipated in the protocol. We opted to analyse the outcomes for the longest point of follow up shared by several trials of the same comparison (since to extract and analyse all time points risks a Type I error).<BR/>

<P>Risk of bias is summarised in the figures (<LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>; <LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>) with judgements explained in the <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>. Risk of bias was a key consideration in assessing the quality of the evidence and used (and justified) in the Summary of Findings Tables to downgrade the evidence where appropriate. Overall the quality of reporting was poor and it was frequently not possible to determine whether allocation was fully concealed. Two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Mphande-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Mphande 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kamaratos-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Kamaratos 2014</LINK>) used quasi-random methods of allocation and these are at high risk of selection bias as a consequence. Most of the included studies were at risk of performance bias as neither participants nor health care providers were blinded to treatment allocation. The main outcomes of complete healing, adverse events and infection have, to varying extents, an element of subjectivity inherent in them and 14 out of 26 included studies reported having used blinded outcome assessment.</P>
</STUDY_QUALITY>
<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS MODIFIED="2015-03-03 05:31:21 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The 26 trials included 3011 participants. The trials were generally small (median sample size 83.5, range 30 to 900), and there was very obvious clinical and methodological heterogeneity. It was not appropriate, therefore, to combine the trials in a single meta-analysis to produce a summary statistic for honey overall, or even subgroup summary statistics for acute, chronic, or mixed wounds. Within the subgroups (acute, mixed acute and chronic, and chronic wounds) trials have been combined in meta-analysis where appropriate. Otherwise the trials have been summarised narratively.</P>
<P>In common with wounds research in general, adverse event reporting was variable in nature and often poor in quality. Five trials did not report adverse events (<LINK REF="STD-Baghel-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Baghel 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kamaratos-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Kamaratos 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Subrahmanyam-1996a" TYPE="STUDY">Subrahmanyam 1996a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Subrahmanyam-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Subrahmanyam 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Weheida-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Weheida 1991</LINK>), and five trials stated that there were no adverse events or no adverse events related to treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Gethin-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Gethin 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gulati-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Gulati 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Marshall-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Marshall 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McIntosh-2006" TYPE="STUDY">McIntosh 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Subrahmanyam-1996b" TYPE="STUDY">Subrahmanyam 1996b</LINK>). One trial reported the number of people with any adverse event (<LINK REF="STD-Jull-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Jull 2008</LINK>), as well as itemising specific types of events. The remaining trials appear to have limited reporting of events to specific types of events, rather than encouraging reports of any event. Adverse events are presented by wound type, and the comparators indicated in footnotes and any meta-analysis uses a random-effects model due to the heterogeneity. Although only one trial explicitly reported frequency of events by participant (<LINK REF="STD-Jull-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Jull 2008</LINK>), it is assumed one event equals one participant in all other trials (this may be an erroneous assumption).</P>
<P>The "infection" data in these studies are not well reported and impossible to analyse in a robust manner and interpret reliably across all wound types. One of the main problems is the lack of a definition of infection within most trial reports and an inconsistency between trials. Most of the burns trials reported "positive" swab cultures at baseline and then the proportion rendered "sterile" at subsequent time points (usually 7 days). However a positive swab culture is NOT the same as a clinical infection (the diagnosis of the latter being dependent on signs and symptoms as well as culture). Consequently we cannot draw conclusions about the treatment effects of honey dressings and comparators from these data. We have confined our analysis of the burns studies to the outcome of "proportion of burns with negative swabs at 7 days" however this is a less clinically relevant outcome than healing, or clinical infection.</P>

<P>Mean time to healing was not published, but was later provided by the author (personal communication: M Subrahmanyam).

The quality of this evidence was downgraded for imprecision on the basis that there is only one trial with a total of 50 participants and whilst the difference in time to healing was statistically significant and clinically important, this is a small single study. We also downgraded the quality of the evidence for indirectness, since honey is not the only systematic difference in the treatments for this comparison as the burn excision and grafting interventions were also different (therefore the trial does not directly address the question of whether honey dressings are effective for burns). <I>Low quality evidence.</I>

The trials used different burn grading systems to report the depth of burns, which reflected the age of the trials and the lack of a clinical consensus on reporting burn depth. The burns, however, did tend towards the less severe end of the spectrum, although early staging systems (e.g. first-, second- and third-degree burns, or superficial, partial-thickness and full-thickness) do not have the sensitivity of more recent systems (i.e. epidermal, superficial dermal, mid-dermal, deep dermal and full-thickness), and participants with deep partial-thickness and deep dermal burns are likely to require skin grafting (<LINK REF="REF-NZGG-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">NZGG 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>Trials recruited participants with superficial and partial-thickness burns (<LINK REF="STD-Baghel-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Baghel 2009</LINK>), superficial burns (<LINK REF="STD-Subrahmanyam-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Subrahmanyam 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Subrahmanyam-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Subrahmanyam 1998</LINK>), superficial, partial- and deep partial-thickness burns (<LINK REF="STD-Mashood-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Mashood 2006</LINK>), and one recruited participants with superficial, dermal, mid and deep dermal burns (<LINK REF="STD-Memon-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Memon 2005</LINK>).

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Outcome: healing</HEADING>
<P>One trial reported mean time to healing and the risk of healing at different times (<LINK REF="STD-Subrahmanyam-2001a" TYPE="STUDY">Subrahmanyam 2001a</LINK>), and five trials reported either mean time to healing without standard deviations (<LINK REF="STD-Baghel-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Baghel 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Memon-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Memon 2005</LINK>), or risk of complete healing (<LINK REF="STD-Mashood-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Mashood 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Subrahmanyam-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Subrahmanyam 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Subrahmanyam-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Subrahmanyam 1998</LINK>), but at different time points i.e., two, four, and six weeks (<LINK REF="STD-Mashood-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Mashood 2006</LINK>), and seven, 10, 15, 21 and 30 days (<LINK REF="STD-Subrahmanyam-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Subrahmanyam 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>Additional information was sought from authors and provided by one author (personal communication: M Subrahmanyam). <LINK REF="STD-Baghel-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Baghel 2009</LINK> reported an exact p-value for the comparison of time to healing and this was used to calculate the standard error for mean time to healing. Thus mean time to healing was used as the outcome, with the result that four trials out of six could be pooled for the outcome of mean time to healing using a random effects model (heterogeneity was extremely high, I² = 93%). In these four trials, people whose burns were treated with honey experienced an average reduction in healing time of 5 days (WMD -5.12 days, 95% CI -9.51 to -0.73) (<LINK REF="CMP-004.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.1</LINK>). This was <I>very low quality evidence </I>(downgraded for inconsistency and imprecision) (<LINK REF="SOF-03" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 3</LINK>).</P>
<P>In the trial that did not report standard deviations with mean time to healing (<LINK REF="STD-Memon-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Memon 2005</LINK>), the honey-treated group had a mean time to healing of 15.3 days and it was 20.0 days in the SSD group (<LINK REF="STD-Memon-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Memon 2005</LINK>). In the remaining trial (<LINK REF="STD-Mashood-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Mashood 2006</LINK>), all 25 participants in the honey-treated group were healed by four weeks, while all patients in the SSD group were healed by six weeks.</P>
<P>All six trials reported the risk of complete healing at either 4 or six weeks (or both) as well as several earlier time points. We wished to reduce the risk of Type I errors inherent in multiple endpoint analysis. We therefore report the pooled risk of complete healing for all six trials at 4 to 6 weeks (<LINK REF="STD-Mashood-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Mashood 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Subrahmanyam-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Subrahmanyam 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Subrahmanyam-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Subrahmanyam 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Subrahmanyam-2001a" TYPE="STUDY">Subrahmanyam 2001a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Baghel-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Baghel 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Memon-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Memon 2005</LINK>) using a random effects model because although the I<SUP>2 </SUP>was 0% these trials are clearly different in terms of frequency of dressing changes, types of burns and duration of follow up. There was no difference in the risk of burns healing by 4 to 6 weeks when treated with honey compared with SSD (RR 1.00 95% CI 0.98 to 1.02). <I>High quality evidence </I>(<LINK REF="SOF-03" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 3</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Outcome: adverse events</HEADING>
<P>Burns trials tended to report the frequencies of hypergranulation, contracture, hypertrophic scarring, minor scarring, itching and burning as adverse events however it was generally unclear if events were reported by individual without double counting, or (more likely) some individuals experienced more than one adverse event. Consequently we are not confident of the accuracy of the adverse events data. The adverse event data across the five trials that reported them (<LINK REF="STD-Baghel-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Baghel 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mashood-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Mashood 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Memon-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Memon 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Subrahmanyam-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Subrahmanyam 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Subrahmanyam-2001a" TYPE="STUDY">Subrahmanyam 2001a</LINK>) were pooled (random effects); importantly <LINK REF="STD-Mashood-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Mashood 2006</LINK> stated that there was "no difference" between groups in rates of contracture and hypertrophic scarring but only reported rates of itching and burning. Overall there were significantly fewer adverse events with honey than SSD (RR 0.29 95% CI 0.20 to 0.42) (<LINK REF="CMP-004.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.3</LINK>). <I>High quality evidence </I>(<LINK REF="SOF-03" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 3</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Outcome: infection</HEADING>
<P>Infection related outcomes were reported in a variety of ways: most consistently five out of six trials reported the proportion of burns yielding negative swabs at Day 7 (<LINK REF="STD-Baghel-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Baghel 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Memon-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Memon 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Subrahmanyam-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Subrahmanyam 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Subrahmanyam-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Subrahmanyam 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Subrahmanyam-2001a" TYPE="STUDY">Subrahmanyam 2001a</LINK>). The report of <LINK REF="STD-Mashood-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Mashood 2006</LINK> merely stated the time to sterility (with no SD or other measure of variance) in each group. There was very high statistical heterogeneity when pooling the five studies (I<SUP>2</SUP>=94%). Overall wound swabs from honey treated burns were more likely to be negative at 7 days than were swabs from SSD treated burns (RR 3.92 95% CI 1.32 to 11.63) (<LINK REF="CMP-004.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.4</LINK>) however this is <I>very low quality evidence </I>(downgraded for inconsistency, imprecision and indirectness) (<LINK REF="SOF-03" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 3</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Outcome: healing</HEADING>
<P>The mean time to healing was reported for both trials without SDs which were subsequently supplied by the author (personal communication: M Subrahmanyam).

<P>For the <LINK REF="STD-Subrahmanyam-1993b" TYPE="STUDY">Subrahmanyam 1993b</LINK> study, information on overall mean time to healing was provided by the author (personal communication: M Subrahmanyam).

Although it was not possible to separate out the results for people with venous leg ulcers that study also found no difference in risk of healing between honey and usual care (see section 3.6 below).</P>

</P>
<P>The <LINK REF="STD-Jull-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Jull 2008</LINK> trial appropriately analysed healing as a time to event outcome using a survival approach. There was no difference in healing between groups treated with honey and usual (non-honey) care (adjusted hazard ratio, HR, 1.1, 95% CI 0.8 to 1.5, P=0.451). There was no difference in the risk of healing at 12 weeks with or without honey (RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.37).</P>
<P>The <LINK REF="STD-Gethin-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Gethin 2007</LINK> study had change in area of slough at four weeks as the primary outcome and proportion of ulcers healed at 12 weeks as a secondary outcome. In this study 24/54 (44.4%) participants in the honey group had healed at 12 weeks compared with 18/54 (33.3%) in the control group (RR of healing 1.33, 95% CI 0.82 to 2.16).</P>
<P>Although the duration of treatment was dissimilar across the two trials, they were considered sufficiently alike to be able to provide meaningful information when combined (I² 0%). Overall it is not clear whether honey increases the healing of venous leg ulcers compared with no honey (RR 1.15, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.38) (<LINK REF="CMP-007.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 7.3</LINK>) (<I>low quality evidence; </I>downgraded for risk of bias due to unblinded outcome assessment and imprecision) (<LINK REF="SOF-04" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 4</LINK>).</P>

<P>The <LINK REF="STD-Jull-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Jull 2008</LINK> trial (368 participants) reported all adverse events, whether or not the event was believed to be related to the treatment, whereas the <LINK REF="STD-Gethin-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Gethin 2007</LINK> trial (108 participants) only referred to events that were attributable to the wound agent, of which there were none (and this approach is subject to ascertainment bias in an open label study). In the <LINK REF="STD-Jull-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Jull 2008</LINK> trial there were significantly more adverse events (including deterioration of the ulcer) reported in the honey-treated group than the control group (RR 1.28, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.56). The frequency of the different adverse events is presented in <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>.

<LINK REF="STD-Jull-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Jull 2008</LINK> and colleagues conducted a full cost-effectiveness analysis using a New Zealand health service perspective. Information was collected on dressings and related products, district nursing time, general practitioner and laboratory time, outpatient consultations, antibiotic use, and hospitalisation. In the base case analysis, the average cost of treatment with honey was NZD 917.00 per participant compared with NZD 972.68 per participant for usual care. This cost was driven by a small difference in hospitalisations that was considered likely to be due to chance variation (three participants in the honey group were hospitalised for ulcer-related reasons for 10 days, compared to six participants hospitalised for 40 days). A sensitivity analysis excluding the hospitalisations found the average cost of treatment was reversed with usual care being cheaper (NZD 811.12 per participant) than treatment with honey (NZD 877.90 per participant).</P>

Two generic instruments (SF-36, EQ5D) and one disease-specific instrument (Charing Cross Venous Ulcer Questionnaire) were used.

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2015-02-28 00:46:10 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This is a complex review addressing a diverse range of wound types and with many trials at high or unclear risk of bias. Generally, the evidence, when assessing using GRADE, is of low or very low quality. This means that new, better quality research is highly likely to change the overall conclusions of this review. The findings are discussed below with respect to specific wound types and using a GRADE approach to addressing the quality of the evidence.</P>
<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-02-28 00:46:10 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">1. Acute wounds</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">1.1 Minor acute wounds</HEADING>
<P>It is unclear, on the basis of the very low quality evidence from three small trials (two in toenail bed avulsion and one in minor traumatic wounds) whether honey affects time to wound healing in minor acute wounds compared with conventional dressings. It is also unclear if honey and conventional dressings have different effects on adverse events or rates of infection in people with minor acute wounds (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">1.2 Burns</HEADING>
<P>The 11 trials of honey for burns used a wide range of comparator treatments, viz. various conventional dressings (<LINK REF="STD-Subrahmanyam-1993a" TYPE="STUDY">Subrahmanyam 1993a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Subrahmanyam-1996a" TYPE="STUDY">Subrahmanyam 1996a</LINK>), early burn excision and grafting (<LINK REF="STD-Subrahmanyam-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Subrahmanyam 1999</LINK>), silver sulfadiazine (SSD) (<LINK REF="STD-Baghel-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Baghel 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mashood-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Mashood 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Memon-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Memon 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Subrahmanyam-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Subrahmanyam 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Subrahmanyam-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Subrahmanyam 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Subrahmanyam-2001a" TYPE="STUDY">Subrahmanyam 2001a</LINK>), amniotic membrane (<LINK REF="STD-Subrahmanyam-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Subrahmanyam 1994</LINK>) and potato peelings (<LINK REF="STD-Subrahmanyam-1996b" TYPE="STUDY">Subrahmanyam 1996b</LINK>).</P>
<P>The evidence for the effects of honey relative to these comparators is mixed, and is generally of low or very low quality. The strongest (high quality) evidence suggests that honey dressings heal partial thickness burns, on average, between 4 and 5 days more quickly than conventional dressings, however it is not clear if there is a difference in the rates of adverse events or infection (<LINK REF="SOF-02" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 2</LINK>).</P>
<P>One trial (low quality evidence) suggests that early excision and grafting heals burns on average 13.6 days more quickly (95% CI 9.82 days to 17.3 days) than honey followed by grafting as necessary, however the relative effects on adverse events and infection rates are unclear (<LINK REF="STD-Subrahmanyam-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Subrahmanyam 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>There is very low quality evidence that honey reduces the time for burns to heal by between 0.73 and 9.51 days (average difference was 5.12 days) compared with SSD dressings/cream and high quality evidence of a reduction in adverse events with honey and more negative wound swabs at day 7. There was no difference for the outcome of risk of complete healing by 4 to 6 weeks (high quality evidence) (<LINK REF="SOF-03" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 3</LINK>).</P>
<P>Perhaps unsurprisingly, the current evidence suggests that burns heal more quickly with honey than with amniotic membranes (by approximately 8 days) (<LINK REF="STD-Subrahmanyam-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Subrahmanyam 1994</LINK>) and approximately 6 days more quickly than with potato peelings (<LINK REF="STD-Subrahmanyam-1996b" TYPE="STUDY">Subrahmanyam 1996b</LINK>) (single small studies, moderate quality evidence). The relative effects of these interventions on adverse events and infection are unclear.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">2. Mixed acute and chronic wounds</HEADING>
<P>The rationale for conducting trials in which the participants have either burns or a mix of chronic wounds is unclear. The aetiologies are so different that no matter what the results, the findings will be difficult to interpret and unlikely to influence clinical practice. Overall we found low quality evidence from two studies <LINK REF="STD-Mphande-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Mphande 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Subrahmanyam-1993b" TYPE="STUDY">Subrahmanyam 1993b</LINK>), that on average honey heals a heterogeneous population of acute and chronic wounds more quickly than sugar dressings or SSD. The comparative rates of adverse events and infection are unclear.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">3. Chronic wounds</HEADING>
<P>Most of the evidence for the effects of honey on chronic wounds is of low or very low quality. Most trials were small, with comparators that may not be relevant to current practice and at high or unclear risk of bias.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">3.1 Infected post-operative wounds</HEADING>
<P>There is moderate quality evidence that honey increases the absolute risk of healing by 35% (95%CI 8.7% to 55.4%) relative to antiseptic (povidone iodine) washes followed by gauze. The single trial (<LINK REF="STD-Al-Waili-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Al Waili 1999</LINK>) was small (50 participants) and the report lacked sufficient detail to permit the risk of bias to be determined accurately for most domains. The comparator was an antiseptic which has been proposed to impair wound healing although clinical evidence for such an effect is lacking (<LINK REF="REF-Leaper-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leaper 1986</LINK>). In the same study there were fewer adverse events and a shorter time to a negative wounds swab with honey.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">3.2 Pressure ulcers</HEADING>
<P>There is very low quality evidence that honey increases the relative risk of healing of pressure ulcers by 41% (95% CI 5% to 90%) relative to saline soaked gauze (<LINK REF="STD-Weheida-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Weheida 1991</LINK>). This equates to an increase in the absolute risk of healing with honey of 30% (95%CI 7.7% to 51.9%). The quality of the evidence for the effect on healing from this trial was downgraded to very low quality for imprecision and possible selection bias. There were no data on adverse events or infection.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">3.3 Fournier's gangrene</HEADING>
<P>There is very low quality evidence that honey healed Fournier&#8217;s gangrene, on average, 8 days more quickly than Eusol soaks (1 trial, WMD -8.00 days, 95% CI -6.08 to -9.92 days). In this small study (30 participants) <LINK REF="STD-Subrahmanyam-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Subrahmanyam 2004</LINK>), 64% (honey group) and 69% (EUSOL group) of participants also required secondary suturing and grafting. In addition, the comparator was EUSOL, an antiseptic that has been shown to impair wound healing in animal model studies (<LINK REF="REF-Brennan-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brennan 1985</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">3.4 Cutaneous Leishmaniasis</HEADING>
<P>It is not clear whether honey influences the healing of lesions caused by Leishmaniasis when used as an adjuvant to meglumine antimoniate. The low quality evidence from a single small trial suggests that honey may impair healing compared with meglumine antimoniate alone (RR 0.72; 95% CI 0.50 to 1.04) (<LINK REF="STD-Nilforoushzadeh-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Nilforoushzadeh 2007</LINK>) however the quality of this evidence for an effect on healing was downgraded for imprecision and high risk of bias. In terms of adverse events, there was one reported withdrawal from the honey group for sensitivity and none in the control group. Infection rates were not reported.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">3.5 Venous leg ulcers</HEADING>
<P>There is currently no clear evidence that honey improves the rate of healing of venous ulcers. Such evidence that there is, from two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Gethin-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Gethin 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jull-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Jull 2008</LINK>) is low quality and finds no overall difference in healing (RR 1.15, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.38) (<LINK REF="SOF-04" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 4</LINK>). The larger of the two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Jull-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Jull 2008</LINK>) analysed healing (appropriately) as a time-to-event outcome which is more informative (and uses more of the information on healing) than crudely analysing the proportions of participants healed at a particular (arbitrary) time point. This study found no difference in the hazard of healing between honey and usual care (hazard ratio 1.1, 95%CI 0.8 to 1.5). These trials reported adverse events differently with <LINK REF="STD-Gethin-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Gethin 2007</LINK> only reporting those they "attributed" to the wound treatment (there were none). This approach has an inherently high risk of ascertainment bias in an open label study. By contrast <LINK REF="STD-Jull-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Jull 2008</LINK> documented and reported all adverse events and there were more in the honey group than the control group, with pain and ulcer deterioration being frequent (absolute increase in risk of adverse events with honey was 12.9%, 95%CI 2.7% to 22.8%).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">3.6 Diabetic foot ulcers</HEADING>
<P>The effect of honey on diabetic foot ulcers cannot be determined.

<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2014-12-31 04:54:03 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="Nicky Cullum">
<P>There are significant weaknesses in the completeness and applicability of the evidence overall. Most of the studies in burns have been conducted by one team in India (10 out of 26 included studies; <LINK REF="STD-Subrahmanyam-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Subrahmanyam 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Subrahmanyam-1993a" TYPE="STUDY">Subrahmanyam 1993a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Subrahmanyam-1993b" TYPE="STUDY">Subrahmanyam 1993b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Subrahmanyam-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Subrahmanyam 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Subrahmanyam-1996a" TYPE="STUDY">Subrahmanyam 1996a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Subrahmanyam-1996b" TYPE="STUDY">Subrahmanyam 1996b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Subrahmanyam-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Subrahmanyam 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Subrahmanyam-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Subrahmanyam 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Subrahmanyam-2001a" TYPE="STUDY">Subrahmanyam 2001a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Subrahmanyam-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Subrahmanyam 2004</LINK>) and we relied on further information supplied by the authors to supplement an absence of detail in the original published trial reports. This review is therefore disproportionately reliant on evidence from one single research team from one part of the world and this evidence may not be applicable elsewhere (particularly since the prevailing microbiological environment, health care facilities and climate are likely to have strong effects on burn outcomes and infection rates).</P>
<P>Only one study (<LINK REF="STD-Jull-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Jull 2008</LINK>) reported costs and quality of life. Clearly any impact of treatments on patients' quality of life is invaluable information for all decision makers but particularly patients. The relative cost-effectiveness of competing treatments is essential information for health care funders and providers. We therefore urge that future research in this field uses contemporary methodologies to measure these outcomes. </P>
<P>There is relatively little replication of studies, with single, small studies for most comparisons. This weak evidence base makes it impossible to draw firm conclusions with confidence.</P>
<P>Some of the comparators chosen have little or no relevance to current clinical decision making (e.g., amniotic membrane, potato peelings). Other comparators will have relevance in some parts of the world but not others. For example antiseptics such as EUSOL and povidone iodine are used less frequently in open wounds than they used to be, in the developed world at least, because <I>in vitro</I> studies were interpreted as evidence that they may impair wound healing (<LINK REF="REF-Leaper-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leaper 1986</LINK>). Silver sulfadiazine, which is commonly used in burns and was the comparator in several of the studies included here, has been shown in a related review (<LINK REF="REF-Wasiak-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wasiak 2013</LINK>) to impair the healing of burns relative to several comparator dressings.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2015-02-14 04:19:26 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="Nicky Cullum">
<P>In common with most wounds-related topic areas, the quality of the evidence in this review was generally low or very low - mainly due to imprecision, risk of bias and inconsistency. Imprecision of effect estimates was usually low because there are only one or two small studies for each comparison. Risk of bias was generally high due to unblinded outcome assessment. Most studies did not guard against performance bias (by blinding participants and health care professionals) however the importance of performance bias in wound care studies is not clear. Blinded outcome assessment is however a substantial threat to validity (<LINK REF="REF-Hr_x00f3_bjartsson-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hróbjartsson 2012</LINK>). We downgraded the quality of the evidence for inconsistency where there was obvious clinical or statistical heterogeneity. Poor reporting is a major issue and the majority of studies were unclear for one or more important bias domains in the risk of bias assessment. We carefully considered downgrading the evidence for risk of bias where trial reports were unclear (most studies, see <LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>). We decided against downgrading for unclear risk of bias (because it does not appear to be the norm) however this means that, if anything, the evidence is lower quality than we have rated it. The importance of following international standards for trial reporting (i.e., CONSORT, <LINK REF="REF-Schulz-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 2010</LINK>), which most of the studies in this review did not adhere to, cannot be over-emphasised .</P>
<P>The reporting of adverse events was poor in most trials, and non-existent in a few trials. This makes accurate assessment of the risk of adverse events associated with honey dressings compared with comparators, difficult. The International Conference on Harmonization's Guideline for Good Clinical Practice (ICH GCP) defines an adverse event as any untoward medical occurrence in a trial subject who has been administered an intervention, whether related to the intervention or not. With the exception of <LINK REF="STD-Jull-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Jull 2008</LINK>, it was not clear if trials reported all adverse events as required by ICH GCP. Therefore the adverse event findings should be interpreted very cautiously, as the full adverse event profile of honey vs. comparators in different wounds is unknown.</P>
<P>The evidence regarding the effect of honey on wound infection rates was poor quality and difficult to interpret. The accurate identification of wound infection is problematic and since wound infection is dependent to some extent on the host response to the micro-organism (e.g., manifesting as inflammation and pain), and the assessment of this is partly subjective, there is no "gold standard" diagnostic tool . Clinical presentation is an important indicator, but presentation may vary with wound type (<LINK REF="REF-Cutting-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cutting 2005</LINK>), therefore, trialists should strive for unambiguous definitions of infection to ensure that study results are interpretable and their meta-analyses both feasible and sensible.</P>
<P>Infection is a significant and threatening consequence of burns. Wound sterility after a burn is maintained by careful attention to asepsis during wound care and the use of preventive agents. Honey dressings appear to increase the probability that a cultured swab from a burn will remain negative compared with a range of control treatments but the clinical importance of negative swabs at day 7 is unclear. Future trialists should identify and use reliable and valid measures of infection that can be applied in a range of settings.</P>
<P>Only one study conducted a full cost-effectiveness analysis using a health services perspective (<LINK REF="STD-Jull-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Jull 2008</LINK>). As the effectiveness of honey was not established by the trial, honey cannot be considered the dominant strategy. In the same vein, this was also the only study that reported health related quality of life.</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2014-11-26 12:18:57 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="Nicky Cullum">
<P>This review has a number of limitations, driven largely by the nature of the included studies. Firstly one of the included studies was led by one of the authors of this review (<LINK REF="STD-Jull-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Jull 2008</LINK>). This situation is not uncommon in Cochrane reviews and there are robust policies in place to reduce or eliminate any bias this may bring. Specifically data extraction, risk of bias assessment and analysis were checked by three further authors or editors (MW, NC, JD).</P>
<P>Secondly, several studies report and analyse mean time to healing as the main effect measure. Time to healing should be treated as a type of time-to-event outcome rather than a continuous measure, as this enables all participants to contribute data to the analysis irrespective of whether they experienced the outcome or remained in the study (only people who healed can contribute data to an analysis of mean time to healing as a continuous outcome). However, we were limited to using a common means of measurement wherever possible. Third, we attempted to contact authors where the original publication did not provide sufficient data, and then incorporate that data into the review. Where authors did not respond, we excluded the studies that did not report sufficient data even to be included in a narrative analysis. Finally it was not possible to evaluate the overall possibility of publication bias, as not all trials reported the same outcomes and overall the trials were too heterogeneous to combine.</P>
</POTENTIAL_BIASES>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2015-02-28 00:46:10 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two relevant systematic reviews have been published since the last update of this review. In 2013 <LINK REF="REF-Vandamme-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vandamme 2013</LINK> concluded that honey stimulates wound healing in human burns, ulcers and other wounds, and that it debrides, removes odour, has anti-inflammatory and pain reducing properties. There are key methodological differences between our review and the review by <LINK REF="REF-Vandamme-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vandamme 2013</LINK>. They did not restrict inclusion to study designs at lowest risk of bias (but included published controlled trials, clinical trials and case reports as well as RCTs). Secondly there appears to have been no systematic assessment of study quality in the review by <LINK REF="REF-Vandamme-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vandamme 2013</LINK>, but rather allusion to strengths and weaknesses of the included studies in an <I>ad hoc</I> way. Thirdly GRADE was not used to assess the quality of the evidence in the <LINK REF="REF-Vandamme-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vandamme 2013</LINK> review and conclusions were reached by vote counting rather than meta-analysis. There is a great deal of overlap of study inclusion however (though we had excluded several studies included in their review e.g., <LINK REF="STD-Malik-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Malik 2010</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Yapucu-Gunes-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Yapucu Gunes 2007</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Oluwatosin-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Oluwatosin 2000</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Lund_x002d_Nielsen-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Lund-Nielsen 2011</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Misirligou-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Misirligou 2003</LINK>). Elsewhere the explanation for excluding studies from our review that were included in <LINK REF="REF-Vandamme-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vandamme 2013</LINK> was the different eligibility criteria for study population (they included studies of oral mucositis and radiation damage to skin). Notwithstanding these differences there was some agreement in the conclusions reached, viz. their conclusion that "<I>Many of the included studies have methodological problems, and the quality of certain studies is low, making it difficult to formulate conclusive guidelines</I>" (<LINK REF="REF-Vandamme-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vandamme 2013</LINK>). Another systematic review was also published in 2013 (<LINK REF="REF-R_x0171_ttermann-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">R&#369;ttermann 2013</LINK>). This review was prepared to support new German wound care guidelines and used the GRADE approach in summarising the quality of the evidence. Again the patient population differed slightly from ours in that they excluded studies in people with burns and other acute wounds. The review by <LINK REF="REF-R_x0171_ttermann-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">R&#369;ttermann 2013</LINK> concluded that honey does not accelerate wound healing and increases pain (a conclusion based solely on the studies of <LINK REF="STD-Gethin-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Gethin 2007</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Jull-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Jull 2008</LINK> included here). There is much agreement therefore between our conclusions represented in this review update and those of other recent systematic reviews.</P>

</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2015-02-14 04:44:34 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="Nicky Cullum">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2014-11-26 11:59:44 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="Nicky Cullum">
<P>The main challenge to practitioners in considering this evidence is deciding whether the patient populations and comparator interventions are clinically relevant to their practice.</P>
<P>There is high quality evidence from two trials that honey dressings heal partial thickness burns more quickly than conventional dressings by around five days however practitioners must consider whether the comparator dressings in these trials are clinically meaningful to them. In one of the two trials the control dressing was a polyurethane film dressing whilst in the other the control group received a range of interventions (polyurethane film, paraffin gauze, sterile linen, framyecetin-impregnated tulle, left exposed). It is unclear whether there is a difference in rates of adverse events (very low quality evidence) or infection (low quality evidence) between honey and conventional dressings for partial thickness burns.</P>
<P>It is unclear whether there is a difference in the effect on the healing of burns between honey and SSD, since the result is very sensitive to the outcome measure used. Furthermore, SSD has been shown to slow the healing of burns relative to other comparators in a related Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-Wasiak-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wasiak 2013</LINK>).</P>
<P>There is low quality evidence from one small trial that early excision and grafting of partial and full thickness burns may be more effective than honey followed by later grafting as necessary.</P>
<P>Low quality evidence from two small trials with different comparators suggests that honey may heal a mixed population of acute and chronic wounds more quickly than SSD or sugar dressings. Again practitioners will need to consider the relevance of this evidence to current practice.</P>
<P>Moderate quality evidence from one trial suggests that honey heals infected post-operative wounds more quickly than povidone iodine washes followed by gauze and is associated with fewer adverse events.</P>
<P>Very low quality evidence from one small trial suggests that honey may heal pressure ulcers more quickly than saline soaks.</P>
<P>Very low quality evidence from one trial suggests that honey may heal Fournier&#8217;s gangrene more quickly than Eusol soaks.</P>
<P>The effect of honey relative to comparators is unclear for: venous leg ulcers (2 trials, low quality evidence); minor acute wounds (3 trials, very low quality evidence); diabetic foot ulcers (2 trials, low quality evidence); Leishmaniasis (1 trial, low quality evidence); mixed chronic wounds (2 trials, low quality evidence).</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2015-02-14 04:44:34 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="Nicky Cullum">
<P>The implications for further research arising from this review fall into two categories: important research questions and improving the conduct and reporting of future research.</P>
<P>An important research question may well be whether honey dressings heal partial thickness burns more quickly than relevant, current comparator dressings, since currently the only evidence compares honey with film dressings or with a range of very different dressings. It is consequently impossible to determine the effectiveness of honey relative to competing dressings. Evidence from this and a related review (<LINK REF="REF-Wasiak-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wasiak 2013</LINK>) is beginning to accumulate that suggests SSD may not be an effective treatment for burns and yet it is still widely used. Given the quality of the existing evidence, substantial doubt remains and therefore there may be an argument for a definitive, high quality three-arm trial comparing honey dressings with SSD and another widely used conventional dressing.</P>
<P>People with surgical wounds that are infected or have broken down may be another patient group in which to evaluate honey dressings since there is some evidence from one study in this review that they may be effective; again the comparator dressing used in this trial (povidone iodine wash followed by gauze) is no longer relevant in some parts of the world.</P>
<P>For those wounds that are a consequence of underlying systemic disease (chronic wounds such as pressure ulcers, venous ulcers and diabetic foot ulcers, and Leishmaniasis) it seems likely that management of the underlying health problem (or reduction of the applied pressure in the case of diabetic foot and pressure ulcers) will make more difference to healing than the type of dressing and we would suggest that these trials are of lower priority.</P>
<P>In terms of improving the quality of future research we would make the following recommendations:</P>
<OL>
<LI>Where trials are measuring a time to event outcome such as time to healing, they should employ survival approaches which account for censoring. </LI>
<LI>Trials should focus on populations that share a single wound aetiology rather people with wounds of different underlying causes.</LI>
<LI>Trials should be appropriately powered based on identifying a clinically important difference for a pre-specified primary outcome.</LI>
<LI>Trials should apply properly random and concealed allocation strategies and these should be clearly reported.</LI>
<LI>Future studies should use either blinded outcome assessment or some form of masked, remote adjudication of outcomes e.g., photography.</LI>
<LI>It is important to follow up as great a proportion of randomised participants for clinical outcomes as possible, even when they withdraw from trial treatments.</LI>
<LI>Analysis should use the intention-to-treat principle and include all participants in the denominator. Where participants have been lost to follow-up, appropriate and valid methods of imputation should be used and reported.</LI>
<LI>The patient should be the unit of randomisation and analysis, rather than individual wounds.</LI>
<LI>Future trials should measure and report health-related quality of life using valid and reliable measures (both generic and wound specific). Similarly future trials should measure the costs of alternative treatments and ideally assess cost-effectiveness.</LI>
<LI>Trialists should ensure that the above elements of trial quality are adequately reported, and journals should require that trial reporting is consistent with the Consolidated Statement on Reporting of Trials. Data for outcomes relevant to wound healing should be reported to support full evaluation and reuse.</LI>
<LI>All trials should be registered with a trials register that meets the WHO criteria, and principal investigators should keep their contact details on the register up to date.</LI>

<PRO_REV_DIFF MODIFIED="2014-09-12 20:55:26 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In the first version of the review, two trials that compared active interventions allocated wounds to the interventions rather than participants (<LINK REF="STD-Oluwatosin-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Oluwatosin 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Okeniyi-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Okeniyi 2005</LINK>). The participants had multiple wounds in many cases, and some participants would have received both interventions. In this update, a trial that required participants to have two burns (<LINK REF="STD-Malik-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Malik 2010</LINK>), and a trial that may have randomised participants but appears to have reported healing by pressure injury rather than by participant (<LINK REF="STD-Yapucu-Gunes-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Yapucu Gunes 2007</LINK>), were excluded. The data in these trials were presented by wound and thus could not be combined (if possible) with trials where data were presented by participant in both the first version of the review and this update. Such methods were not foreseen in the protocol, where it was assumed that data would be presented by participant. Randomising by wound breaches the assumption of independence that underpins inferential testing, increases the weight of a study inappropriately if included in a meta-analysis (by doubling the denominator) and thereby artificially improves the precision of the confidence interval for the summary statistic. Additionally, a trial requiring participants to have two wounds that randomises one wound to each treatment is not clinically generalisable as it has reduced between-patient variability. Between-patient variability in pragmatic trials drives external validity. The inclusion criteria have been adjusted in this update to reflect this change.</P>

<B>Quote: </B>"Blinded outcome assessment is not possible for two reasons. As stated, honey leaves an orange staining on the periwound skin (photo 3.1) which would identify which treatment the patient is receiving and secondly, within the main study centre clinic and in community leg ulcer clinics, a person trained in wound management would not be available toassess wounds. Photographs would not be used for blinded outcome assessment, as the ability to achieve high quality photos from each centre for each patient was not possible. Therefore, the trial would be classified as open label."<BR/>

<P>Thank you for your feedback. this statement has been present in the Authors' conclusions since the review was first published in 2008. However this is a valid point and does contravene Cochrane guidance from the Handbook which states " The primary purpose of the review should be to present information, rather than to offer advice". As a result we have modified this section to read: "There is insufficient evidence to guide clinical practice in other areas, health services may wish to consider avoiding routine use of honey dressings until sufficient evidence of effect is available"</P>

<P>Email received from Barry Wolfenson, Group President, Advanced Wound Care &amp; Drug Development, Derma Sciences.</P>
<P>Q1. Can you please let me know, regarding the 132 Cochrane Reviews on the topic of Wounds, aside from the one titled &#8220;Honey as a topical treatment for wounds&#8221;, how many include studies within the review that are authored by authors of the Cochrane Review itself?</P>
<P>Authors response: This is a very general question; you have not identified the 132 reviews you are referring to and we do not routinely record that information outside of the review. However, any included trial which has a trialist who is also an author of the Cochrane review must declare this in the Declaration of Interests section of the review.</P>
<P>Q2. Given that one of your stated core principles is to minimize bias, can you please let me know your organizational guidelines regarding authorship of reviews and whether or not authors should be able to review their own studies? To a lay person, there seems to be quite a potential for conflict here.</P>
<P>Authors response: In the Cochrane Wounds Group we adhere strictly to the policy that if an author of a Cochrane review is also a trialist of an included trial in that same review they must declare this in the Declaration of Interests section of the review. This declaration is also made in the online Declaration of Interests form which has to be completed by all authors before a protocol or a review can be published on the Cochrane Library.</P>
<P>Q3. As reviewers of the Jull et al study (Randomized clinical trial of honey-impregnated dressings for venous leg ulcers), how did you judge the relative bias of the study author&#8217;s <I>ad hoc</I> decision to remove incidence of infections from the adverse events table?</P>
<P>Authors response: This question is directly with respect to a trial we conducted, not the systematic review. We did not remove incidence of infections from adverse events. The incidence of infection was analysed separately as specified <I>a priori</I> in the protocol and statistical analysis plan in response to interest in whether honey may prevent infections in venous leg ulcers.</P>
<P>Q4. With regard to the above, the removal of infections from the adverse events section somehow allowed the study authors to also remove the costs associated with hospitalizations associated with those infections from their overall cost of care analysis. However, the other costs associated with hospitalization (not having to do with infection) remained. When the costs associated with hospitalizations due to infection were included in the analysis, the honey arm was less expensive. Only after the costs associated with the additional hospitalizations associated with infection were removed (<I>ad hoc</I>) was the honey arm more expensive. Given that the decision to remove infections was <I>ad hoc</I>, how did you judge the relative bias of the statement by the study authors that the honey arm was likely more expensive?</P>
<P>Authors response: This question is directly with respect to a trial we conducted, not the systematic review. Incidence of infection was included in all the cost analyses. An analysis for sensitivity of the base case (all costs for ulcer treatment) to the small number of patients hospitalized for treatment related to their ulcer was undertaken. We do not know what the exact purpose of the hospitalization was i.e. whether it was related to infection or not, only that it was self-reported by the patients as related to their ulcer. As explained in the paper, the difference was likely due to random variability rather than use of honey or not. The decision to sensitivity test the base case was not ad hoc.</P>
<P>Q5. As reviewers of the Jull et al study, how did you judge the relative bias of the study regarding the author&#8217;s conclusion that honey dressings should not be considered for venous leg ulcer healing given that all the primary and secondary endpoints favored the honey arm (although not statistically)? It would seem, based on the results of the study, that honey should be included into the control group of alginate, hydrofiber, hydrocolloid, foam, non-adherent, iodine, and silver-based dressings as dressings that have demonstrated efficacy as adjuvants to compression therapy. Again, given the positive nature of the evidence derived in this study, how did you judge the potential bias within the authors&#8217; conclusion?</P>
<P>Authors response: This question is directly with respect to a trial we conducted, not the systematic review. There were no statistically significant differences between the groups on the primary outcome, nor on any of the secondary outcomes. In fact the results for the blinded verification of healing suggest barely any difference between groups (absolute difference 0.5%, 95%CI -10.6% to 11.3%) on the primary outcome. Routine use of honey dressings is therefore not superior to other dressings for promoting healing compared to usual care. This conclusion does not preclude non-routine use of honey.</P>
<P>Q6. You included a second study in your Cochrane Review to address the management of venous leg ulcers. This second study, by Gethin et al, allowed only those wounds with greater than 50% slough coverage. In the larger Jull et al study of potentially likely to heal venous leg ulcers, the authors stated that the positive results (not statistically significant) favoring honey should be &#8220;generalizable&#8221; to all venous leg ulcers, regardless of wound bed appearance, unless new data shows otherwise. In the Gethin study, the wounds in both arms had average slough coverage ranging from 78% - 86%, and had average wound areas of 9.9cm<SUP>2</SUP> to 10.5cm<SUP>2</SUP>. However, in the Jull study, there is no notation of slough coverage and the wounds ranged in average area from only 2.6cm<SUP>2</SUP> to 2.7cm<SUP>2</SUP>. Thus, the wound bed appearance was dramatically different between these two studies. If the authors of the Jull study thought it was wise to view different wound bed appearance as indicative of a different patient set, why did you chose to combine results of these two vastly different studies? It should be noted that in the Gethin study on harder-to-heal wounds, even a much smaller number of patients resulted in the honey arm providing statistically significant healing benefit over control. Based on what the authors of the Jull et al study stated, shouldn&#8217;t your conclusions from these two studies have been: Honey provides a non-significant healing benefit for routine venous leg ulcers, and provides a significant healing benefit for non-routine venous leg ulcers?</P>
<P>Authors response: The commentator states two studies were &#8220;vastly different&#8221; but mistakenly compares median ulcer size reported in Jull et al to mean ulcer size reported in Gethin &amp; Cowman, two statistics that are not comparable. The median ulcer area reported in Gethin &amp; Cowman was 5.4 and 4.2 cm2. Ulcer duration is also an important consideration when considering likelihood of healing. The mean duration of ulceration prior to enrolment in the Gethin and Cowman study was 39 weeks and 30 weeks, which was similar to the means in Jull et al (39 and 48 weeks). To suggest therefore that Gethin &amp; Cowman recruited harder-to-heal wounds compared to Jull et al is not accurate. These studies were not dissimilar in terms of populations and there is no evidence to suggest that they were different in terms of wound bed appearance &#8211; one trial provided information on this factor, another did not. In the Gethin &amp; Cowman study, the statistically significant difference only emerged in the adjusted analysis. The unadjusted analysis for Gethin and Cowman is presented in the systematic review and shows no significant difference (RR 1.33, 95%CI 0.82 &#8211; 2.16).</P>
<P>Q7. Regarding honey versus SSD, why should the results of these studies be disregarded as you suggest due to other studies having shown benefit of hydrocolloids and silicone based dressings over SSD? Does this mean that you recommend that no other studies be done comparing one arm to SSD in the treatment of partial thickness burns?</P>
<P>Authors response: There is evidence that suggests SSD cream applied from time treatment initiated until healing may delay healing. (Thomas SS et al. J Wound Care 1995;4:218-20. Wyatt D et al. J Trauma 1990;30:857-65. Bugmann P et al. Burns 1998;24:609-12.) It appears the issue may be how SSD cream is used, not whether it is used. Our focus in the review was in trying to understand whether honey conferred a benefit. Using an appropriate comparator is pertinent to such an analysis and it is not clear that SSD applied daily from treatment initiation to healing is an appropriate comparator.</P>
<P>Q8. Regarding the above, which do you think is the more commonly used product on partial thickness burns, SSD or hydrocolloids? Are you aware of the commonplace usage on SSD in burn centers? If so, why would you suggest disregarding the results of studies which show a benefit over SSD? If not, and you find this to be true (that SSD is still commonly used in burn centers), would you change your decision to disregard the evidence derived from studies utilizing SSD as a control arm?</P>
<P>Authors response: See above</P>
<P>Q9. Also regarding the honey vs SSD studies, can you provide a more thorough clarification on why the CHIT method employed by the investigator disqualified these studies from your analysis?</P>
<P>Authors response: The use of the chit method did not disqualify any trial from consideration. Authors of trials that did not describe the method for generating the random sequence were approached for further information. The author of 11 trials replied stating the sequence was &#8220;manually generated random numbers by the chit method&#8221;, without providing any further information about what was meant by this approach with respect to sequence generation. We sought the advice of broadly experienced senior biostatistician who could not infer from this response what method of sequence generation was used. We therefore stated in the Risk of bias tables &#8220;method of generation of random sequence not reported. The author informed us that the sequence was generated by the &#8216;chit method&#8217;, but it is not clear what this method is.&#8221;</P>
<P>Q10. Of the 6 additional studies cited as rationale for this &#8220;updated&#8221; Cochrane Review, 5 out of the 6 are positive in favor of honey. Why is only the one negative study included in your updated conclusion? How did the biases of this study, as well as the overall structure of the study, compare with the other 5 studies which were not included in your updated conclusion? Were these differences the reason you only cited the negative study?</P>
<P>Authors response: When a review is updated we run the searches again and assess the resulting output. For this update we identified six additional studies which met the inclusion criteria published in the review, and all six studies were included in the review with the results of those studies presented.</P>
<P>Q11. Would someone be wrong if they stated it appears as though your inclusion of only the one negative study, and lack of inclusion of the 5 positive studies, appears to be &#8220;cherry picking&#8221;?</P>
<P>Authors response: A systematic review is conducted according to a defined, peer reviewed and published protocol to minimize bias. Any studies which are excluded have to be identified in the Table of Excluded studies and the reasons for the exclusion made clear. I am assuming you are referring to the six additional studies which were included in the last update of this review. All six studies are &#8220;included studies&#8221;.</P>
<P>Q12. Regarding the one negative study, which was on the treatment of cutaneous Leishmaniasis (a wound resulting from a bite from a sand fly indigenous to the Middle East), the study authors note that further studies should be done using standardized medical grade honeys, such as <I>Leptospermum Scoparium</I> (Manuka Honey). They acknowledge the fact that they used plain local honey could have been the reason for not achieving positive results. Why did you not include this in your conclusions or anywhere in your description of the study?</P>
<P>Authors response: The purpose of the review was to summarise the available evidence, not to restate authors&#8217; interpretations.</P>
<P>Q13. Regarding the negative study on honey vs early excision and grafting of mixed partial and full thickness ulcers, to the best of your knowledge, how many studies do you know that compare one dressing vs this surgical standard and show improved results? Given the rest of the consistently positive results of the other honey studies cited for management of partial thickness burns, do you think the results of the early excision and grafting study suggest that honey would in any way be dangerous to use on partial thickness wounds that do not require early excision and grafting? If so, why?</P>
<P>Authors response: This review does not set out to present results of any dressing when compared with early excision and grafting of mixed partial and full thickness ulcers. Clearly there was sufficient equipoise for a trial to be conducted comparing early excision and grafting versus treatment with honey and delayed grafting as necessary. This trial was therefore included in the review.</P>
<P>Q14. Can you please provide the total numbers of the following: How many studies cited in your review had a statistically significantly positive outcome for the honey arm? How many studies cited in your review had a positive outcome (although not significantly) for the honey arm? How many studies had a negative outcome (although not significantly) for the honey arm? How many studies had a statistically significantly negative outcome for the honey arm?</P>
<P>Authors response: The data extracted from the trials and presented in the results section is provided in the review. Counting the number of statistically significant studies is not a sensible approach to summarising evidence when meta-analysis is possible.</P>
<P>Q15. Given the numbers above, why did you feel that it was important to include in your updated conclusion the following statement; &#8220;&#8230;purchasers should refrain from providing honey dressings for routine use until sufficient evidence of effect is available&#8221;? This statement seems cautionary in its advice. What is the caution that you believe purchasing agents should take into account when considering routine use of honey based dressings?</P>
<P>Authors response: In the light of insufficient evidence a cautionary approach is warranted. Routine use of honey dressings refers to use of honey as a first line dressing.</P>
<P>Q16. Given that Andrew Jull is not only is the author of the key study cited in the Cochrane Review, but that he is also on the editorial board for the wounds group reviewing all Cochrane Reviews on wound care, this question is directed specifically to him in his role as an editor: Due to the lack of well controlled RCTs, the vast majority of Cochrane Reviews on wound dressings / technologies (with the exception of total contact casts) have negative conclusions. The majority of these conclusions all seem to have a &#8220;boiler plate&#8221; type of statement, basically stating &#8220;there is not enough evidence to suggest the use of one product over another.&#8221; Given the recent updated conclusion in the review of honey dressings, do you think, if any of the other reviews are similarly &#8220;updated&#8221; (including those on negative pressure, silver based dressings, alginates, hydrocolloids, foams, etc.), without any meaningful positive results from well controlled studies, do you think that clinicians should similarly be advised to refrain from routine use of those dressings/technologies for routine use until sufficient evidence of effect is available? If not, then why?</P>
<P>Authors response: Andrew Jull is an Editor of the Cochrane Wounds Group; he does not review all Cochrane reviews in wound care and reviews are distributed amongst all the editors and each review is peer reviewed by a number of editors and reviewers. It is not appropriate for the authors of this review to suggest how other authors should write their reviews.</P>
<P>Q17. Why was the statement, &#8220;purchasers should refrain from providing honey dressings for routine use until sufficient evidence of effect is available&#8221; subsequently changed?</P>
<P>Authors response: This change was in response to feedback received from Barry Wolfenson on behalf of Derma Sciences (14<SUP>th</SUP> June 2013) expressing concern at the wording of the Authors' conclusions - as follows: &#8220;There is insufficient evidence to guide clinical practice in other types of wounds, and purchasers should refrain from providing honey dressings for routine use until sufficient evidence of effect is available.&#8221; This statement had been present in the Authors' conclusions since the review was first published in 2008. Cochrane guidance from the Handbook states "The primary purpose of the review should be to present information, rather than to offer advice". Having considered the feedback and received the advice of the Cochrane Collaboration, we have modified this section to read: "&#8230;There is insufficient evidence to guide clinical practice in other areas, and health services may wish to consider avoiding routine use of honey dressings until sufficient evidence of effect is available". Although the primary purpose of a review is to present information, rather than to offer advice, review authors are invited to interpret the findings of their review in the "implications for practice" section. This section is clearly labelled as "authors' conclusions".</P>
<P>Q18. Do you believe the following statement is intended to provide advice; &#8220;&#8230;Health services may wish to consider avoiding routine use of honey dressings until sufficient evidence of effect is available&#8221;? If not, how do you interpret this statement to not be providing advice on usage?</P>
<P>Authors response: Review authors are invited to interpret the findings of their review in the "implications for practice" section and these are clearly labelled as "authors' conclusions". It seems perfectly reasonable where no compelling evidence of benefit has been identified to suggest that decision makers consider this finding. The use of the terms "consider" and "routine" clearly indicate that this is not intended to be a didactic recommendation, simply something for consideration by decision makers.</P>
<P>Q19. How many times is this type of advice given in any of the other Cochrane Reviews regarding wound dressings? Please only limit your response to those Cochrane Reviews that had negative conclusions, such as on alginates, foams, silver dressings, negative pressure, etc&#8230; If the answer is 0 (zero), what do you think is the distinction between the evidence presented for honey-based dressings and the evidence presented for these other dressings/technologies?</P>
<P>Authors response: There is no blueprint for the precise wording of this section, and it is not unusual for Cochrane Reviews to present text that provides guidance that decision makers should consider the absence of high quality evidence of benefit when making treatment decisions.</P>
<P>Q20. Specifically regarding your statement in the Cochrane Review that clinicians may consider refraining from routine use on honey-based dressings, can you please clarify:</P>
<P>20.1 For routine venous leg ulcers: Should clinicians refrain from using honey-based dressings? If so, why?<BR/>Authors response: It is reasonable to highlight the apparent failure of routine use honey dressings to deliver such an important outcome as healing rate.</P>
<P>20.2 For chronic/stalled venous leg ulcers: Should clinicians refrain from using honey-based dressings? If so, why?<BR/>Authors response: All venous leg ulcers are chronic. The evidence from the trials does not address &#8220;stalled&#8221; venous ulcers.</P>
<P>20.3 For other routine ulcers such as pressure ulcers: Should clinicians refrain from using honey-based dressings? If so, why?<BR/>Authors response: The results of the review demonstrate clear uncertainty in respect of this outcome.</P>
<P>20.4 For other chronic/stalled ulcers such as pressure ulcers: Should clinicians refrain from using honey-based dressings? If so, why?<BR/>Authors response: The evidence from the single available trial does not address &#8220;stalled&#8221; pressure ulcers.</P>
<P>20.5 For partial thickness burns that do not require early excision and grafting: Should clinicians refrain from using honey-based dressings? If so, why?Authors response: The<BR/> results of the review demonstrate clear uncertainty in respect of this outcome.</P>
<P>20.6 For any challenging wounds where a clinician would typically use negative pressure, silver-based dressings, iodine-based dressings, alginates, or foams: Should clinicians refrain from using honey-based dressings? If so, why?<BR/>Authors response: There were no trials where the wounds were defined as &#8216;challenging&#8217;.</P>
<P>20.7 Do you consider chronic wounds (whether they be venous leg ulcers, diabetic foot ulcers, pressure ulcers, or dehisced surgical wounds) to be &#8220;routine&#8221;?<BR/>Authors response: It is not clear what is meant by &#8220;routine&#8221; in this context &#8211; none of the conditions are uncommon.</P>
<P>20.8 Do you consider partial thickness burns that are treated in a burn center to be &#8220;routine&#8221;?<BR/>Authors response: It is not clear what is meant by &#8220;routine&#8221; in this context.</P>

<P>Comment: I strongly support evidence-based practice and was trained as a Cochrane reviewer in 1995. Am concerned that this SR is eroding Cochrane credibility as so many wound care professionals have asked me to clarify issues in it. Please help correct the following errors as quickly and thoroughly as possible:<BR/>1. Errors in describing the studies (omission of important facts or perspective), <BR/>2. Arbitrary emphasis on non-statistically significant or irrelevant or inappropriate findings in abstract and conclusions <BR/>3. Omitting statistically significant RCT healing results favorable to honey in abstract and conclusions <BR/>4. Statements in the Authors conclusion and Abstract do not seem to reflect the results reported in the body of the SR <BR/>5. Inappropriate recommendations to avoid honey use that usurp clinician's point of care decisions rather than inform them of level of evidence supporting honey use for various indications, which appears no less sufficient than that for many other wound care interventions. <BR/>My Cochrane trainers insisted we avoid recommending and simply describe levels of evidence to empower clinical decision making. Has this changed?<BR/>To clarify the issues Dr. Janice Beitz and I presented a webinar with more detail on each issue accessible at:<BR/>

<P>Dear Editor: As a Certified Wound Specialist, a Doctor of Physical Therapy with a Masters in Healthcare Administration, and a director of both inpatient and outpatient wound care services at Inspira Health Network in New Jersey I have recently read the Cochrane Review &#8220;Honey as a Topical Treatment for Wounds&#8221; by Jull et al, 2013. A sales representative that does not sell honey products pointed out the conclusion of the Cochrane review to me stating &#8220;health services may wish to consider avoiding routine use of honey dressing until sufficient evidence is available&#8221;. For many years I have been using honey dressings on a variety of wounds including pressure ulcers, venous leg ulcers, arterial ulcers, surgical wounds and diabetic foot ulcers. I have authored and presented multiple case series at international wound congresses demonstrating my success with the use of these dressings on a variety of wounds. I have treated hundreds of wounds with honey and have found these dressings to be helpful in the healing of these wounds and have never noted any severe adverse reactions. I was extremely surprised to see that the conclusion to &#8220;avoid&#8221; usage and question how this recommendation can be made when I have not been able to find evidence nor have experienced any negative issues. Upon my concern with the conclusion I then read with great interest the entire published review.<BR/>Pertaining to the author&#8217;s recommendation to &#8220;avoid&#8221; usage seems to indicate a safety or efficacy concern. In the AE table published in the review, &#8220;ulcer pain&#8221; is the only difference in the number of AEs. However, in the review authors&#8217; own study incorporated into the review (HALT study by Jull et al 2007), the authors note that while pain on dressing changes was more frequent in the honey arm, the pain was not severe enough to cause patients to exit the study, suggesting it was well tolerated. This is similar to my own experience, where if a patient does feel pain upon dressing changes, it is short in duration and well tolerated. Additionally, it has been my experience that application of honey helps to reduce the chronic wound pain commonly suffered by venous leg ulcer patients, potentially due to a reduction in inflammation. Thus, I do not see how this could possibly be an issue with regard to use of honey dressings. Can you please clarify what is the reason for authors&#8217; recommendation to avoid usage? There were only four articles out of 25 reviewed that did not favor honey so please clarify what specific concern the authors have that led to that recommendation.<BR/>I would like to commend the Editors of the Cochrane Review on providing the health care community with a balanced review of clinical information that is helpful in making decisions regarding the treatment of our patients with new procedures and medical products. Unfortunately, this review is inconsistent with my clinical experience as well as the long established excellence of the Cochrane Review. I believe the authors&#8217; conclusion needs to be made clearer. I did agree with the vast majority of the studies having more favorable results in the honey arms of the study but I would also note that the recommendation itself seems out of place in a Cochrane review, and I was very surprised to find it in the review at all.</P>

<P>Dear Editor in Chief,<BR/>I am Burn Surgeon and the Director of one of the largest burn centers in the US, which treats thousands of patients annually. I recently had the pleasure of reviewing your 2013 publication Honey as a topical treatment for wounds (Review) written by Drs. Jull, Walker and Deshpande. While I did enjoy reading the review, I would like to express my concern about the Authors&#8217; Conclusions.<BR/>As a clinician who regularly treats patients who have suffered from partial-thickness and full-thickness burns, I do not share the sentiment expressed by the authors that &#8220;health services may wish to consider avoiding routine use of honey dressings until sufficient evidence of effect is available.&#8221; In my personal experience, communication with other physicians and reviews of available literature, I have found that honey dressings are quite effective, especially where previous treatments have failed to provide benefit.<BR/>Additionally, I believe that the authors have put significant weight in their conclusion on one study (<LINK REF="STD-Subrahmanyam-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Subrahmanyam 1999</LINK>) which evaluated the use of honey dressings compared to the industry standard for moderate to severe partial-thickness and full-thickness burns. It is my opinion, given the vast amount of supportive literature from this author as well as others, that although the results of this study were not in favor of the use of honey dressings, results should not be used to discredit their use. As early excision and grafting is an established practice, it is my opinion that the author was attempting to evaluate honey as an alternative remedy for more troublesome burn injuries. The fact that the study failed to show positive results in this setting informs an upper limit for defining honey dressings as a standard of care treatment in burns and validates the practice of grafting rather than discrediting the use of honey dressings in less severe clinical scenarios.<BR/>It is evident that honey dressings are not a panacea for all wound types and severity, however, the recommendation that the medical community avoid the use of such dressings is confusing as it is not founded by the clinical safety and efficacy evidence (or lack thereof) provided in the review. Therefore, I would ask that you consider revising the aforementioned conclusion.<BR/>Thank you for your time and consideration.</P>

<P>To the Editors of the Cochrane Collaboration, <BR/>After reviewing one of your recent publications, Honey as a topical treatment for wounds (Review), I have become very concerned about some of the language used in the Authors&#8217; Conclusions regarding &#8220;avoiding use&#8221; of honey dressings.<BR/>I am a practicing doctor of osteopathy and Medical Director at Wayne Memorial Wound Care Center in North Carolina. Over 120 patients are seen in our clinic on a weekly basis. I regularly use impregnated honey dressings and honey gel for diabetic, venous and pressure ulcers as well as acute and chronic wounds. I have personally experienced positive patient outcomes and no safety or efficacy issues with this intervention. Additionally I have found honey dressings to be cost efficient to go along with a high patient compliance rate.<BR/>In reading the review, the data presented seems to point towards a positive effect of honey, which correlates with my personal experience. For example, in the pressure ulcer study cited (<LINK REF="STD-Weheida-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Weheida 1991</LINK>), the mean time to healing favored honey with statistical significance. Also in the Diabetic foot ulcer study cited (<LINK REF="STD-Shukrimi-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Shukrimi 2008</LINK>) the endpoint of time to healing also favored honey.<BR/>Therefore, it is confusing to see this conclusion and recommendation that &#8220;There is insufficient evidence to guide clinical practice in other areas, and health services may wish to consider avoiding routine use of honey dressings until sufficient evidence of effect is available.&#8221; It inaccurately gives the reader - especially those who do not read the full review - the impression that this intervention is not safe and efficacious; an impression which is not supported by the data presented or my experience in clinical practice.<BR/>It would like to suggest that you consider revising the current conclusion to help readers have a more balanced perspective of the body of evidence supporting honey base wound care.<BR/>I appreciate your consideration of this matter.</P>

<P>Comment: I was handed a copy of the Cochrane Report on medihoney by the Santyl rep in our area. He of course espoused the report's statement that clinicians should cease use of the product as stated in the report. This prompted me to assess carefully tow of the patients which I was overseeing their complex wounds and using medihoney. I can tell you that the wound made outstanding progress with medihoney - in fact remarkable considering both patients were complex and compromised - one with active cancer undergoing radiation and chemontherapy and the other had breast cancer several years before with reconstructive surgery. At no time did they have any failure of their wound care and I have the photos to prove their excellent results. I am appalled at the campaign Smith &amp; Nephew/Healthpoint has directed at medihoney based on the Cochrane Report - a report that is riddled with inconsistencies.</P>

<P>Thank you for your comment. We were aware of the article&#8217;s retraction and the reason for the retraction. As noted in the review history, review notes, and the references, we used Gethin&#8217;s 2007 PhD thesis as a primary source of information for description of the trial, risk of bias assessment, and outcome data on healing rates and infections. It is worth noting that the extracted data for risk of bias assessments, healing rates, and infections is not in dispute. We used Dr Gethin's data as an input into a meta-analysis that produced a summary statistic for the two trials being pooled. Our interpretations are based on our meta-analysis, not any other analyses from primary sources.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">1.  Was the allocation sequence randomly generated?</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Low risk of bias</HEADING>
<P>The investigators describe a random component in the sequence generation process such as: referring to a random number table; using a computer random number generator; coin tossing; shuffling cards or envelopes; throwing dice; drawing of lots.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">High risk of bias</HEADING>
<P>The investigators describe a non-random component in the sequence generation process. Usually, the description would involve some systematic, non-random approach, for example: sequence generated by odd or even date of birth; sequence generated by some rule based on date (or day) of admission; sequence generated by some rule based on hospital or clinic record number.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Unclear</HEADING>
<P>Insufficient information about the sequence generation process to permit judgement of Yes or No, as above.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">2.  Was the treatment allocation adequately concealed?</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Low risk of bias</HEADING>
<P>Participants and investigators enrolling participants could not foresee assignment because one of the following, or an equivalent method, was used to conceal allocation: central allocation (including telephone, web-based and pharmacy-controlled randomisation); sequentially-numbered drug containers of identical appearance; sequentially-numbered, opaque, sealed envelopes.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">High risk of bias</HEADING>
<P>Participants or investigators enrolling participants could possibly foresee assignments and thus introduce selection bias, such as allocation based on: using an open random allocation schedule (e.g. a list of random numbers); assignment envelopes without appropriate safeguards (e.g. envelopes that were unsealed, non-opaque or not numbered sequentially); alternation or rotation; date of birth; case record number; any other explicitly unconcealed procedure.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Unclear</HEADING>
<P>Insufficient information to permit judgement of Yes or No, as above. This is usually the case if the method of concealment is not described, or not described in sufficient detail to allow a definite judgement, for example if the use of assignment envelopes is described, but it remains unclear whether envelopes were sequentially-numbered, opaque and sealed.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">3.  Blinding was knowledge of the allocated interventions adequately prevented during the study?</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Low risk of bias</HEADING>
<P>Any one of the following:</P>
<UL>
<LI>No blinding, but the review authors judge that the outcome and the outcome measurement are not likely to be influenced by lack of blinding.</LI>
<LI>Blinding of participants and key study personnel ensured, and unlikely that the blinding could have been broken.</LI>
<LI>Either participants or some key study personnel were not blinded, but outcome assessment was blinded and the non-blinding of others was unlikely to introduce bias.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">High risk of bias</HEADING>
<P>Any one of the following:</P>
<UL>
<LI>No blinding, or incomplete blinding, and the outcome or outcome measurement was likely to be influenced by lack of blinding.</LI>
<LI>Blinding of key study participants and personnel attempted, but likely that the blinding could have been broken.</LI>

<UL>
<LI>No missing outcome data.</LI>
<LI>Reasons for missing outcome data unlikely to be related to true outcome (for survival data, censoring unlikely to be introducing bias).</LI>
<LI>Missing outcome data balanced in numbers across intervention groups, with similar reasons for missing data across groups.</LI>
<LI>For dichotomous outcome data, the proportion of missing outcomes compared with observed event risk not high enough to have a clinically relevant impact on the intervention effect estimate.</LI>
<LI>For continuous outcome data, plausible effect size (difference in means or standardised difference in means) among missing outcomes not enough to have a clinically relevant impact on observed effect size.</LI>
<LI>Missing data have been imputed using appropriate methods.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">High risk of bias</HEADING>
<P>Any one of the following:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Reason for missing outcome data likely to be related to true outcome, with either imbalance in numbers or reasons for missing data across intervention groups.</LI>
<LI>For dichotomous outcome data, the proportion of missing outcomes compared with observed event risk is high enough to induce clinically relevant bias in intervention effect estimate.</LI>
<LI>For continuous outcome data, plausible effect size (difference in means or standardized difference in means) among missing outcomes enough to induce clinically relevant bias in observed effect size.</LI>
<LI>As-treated analysis done with substantial departure of the intervention received from that assigned at randomisation.</LI>
<LI>Potentially inappropriate application of simple imputation.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5"> Unclear</HEADING>
<P>Either of the following:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Insufficient reporting of attrition/exclusions to permit judgement of Yes or No, as above (e.g. number randomised not stated, no reasons for missing data provided).</LI>
<LI>The study did not address this outcome.</LI>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Low risk of bias</HEADING>
<P>Either of the following:</P>
<UL>
<LI>The study protocol is available and all of the study's pre-specified (primary and secondary) outcomes that are of interest in the review have been reported in the pre-specified way.</LI>
<LI>The study protocol is not available, but it is clear that the published reports include all expected outcomes, including those that were pre-specified (convincing text of this nature may be uncommon).</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">High risk of bias</HEADING>
<P>Any one of the following:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Not all of the study's pre-specified primary outcomes have been reported.</LI>
<LI>One or more primary outcomes reported using measurements, analysis methods or subsets of the data (e.g. subscales) that were not pre-specified.</LI>
<LI>One or more reported primary outcomes not pre-specified (unless clear justification for their reporting is provided, such as an unexpected adverse effect).</LI>
<LI>One or more outcomes of interest in the review reported incompletely so that they cannot be entered in a meta-analysis.</LI>
<LI>The study report fails to include results for a key outcome that would be expected to have been reported for such a study.</LI>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">6.  Other sources of potential bias:</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Low risk of bias</HEADING>
<P>The study appears to be free of other sources of bias.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">High risk of bias</HEADING>
<P>There is at least one important risk of bias. For example, the study:</P>
<UL>
<LI>had a potential source of bias related to the specific study design used; or</LI>
<LI>stopped early due to some data-dependent process (including a formal-stopping rule); or</LI>
<LI>had extreme baseline imbalance; or</LI>
<LI>has been claimed to have been fraudulent; or</LI>
<LI>had some other problem.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Unclear</HEADING>
<P>There may be a risk of bias, but there is either:</P>
<UL>
<LI>insufficient information to assess whether an important risk of bias exists; or</LI>
<LI>insufficient rationale or evidence that an identified problem will introduce bias.</LI>
