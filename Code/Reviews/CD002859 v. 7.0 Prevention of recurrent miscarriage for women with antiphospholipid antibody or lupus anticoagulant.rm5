<P>Treatments for recurrent miscarriage when there are antibodies in the mothers blood.</P>
<P>Miscarriage can be very distressing for parents and their families. Miscarriage is sometimes associated with substances in the mother blood called 'antiphospholipid antibodies' or 'lupus anticoagulant'. These antibodies are associated with clotting and so it is suggested that anticlotting drugs may be helpful. The review found the quality of the included trials was quite variable, and that prednisone appears to have adverse effects so it has no role in the treatment of recurrent miscarriage. However, a combination of unfractionated heparin with aspirin may be helpful but there are potential side-effects for mothers. More research is needed.</P>

<P>Randomised or quasi-randomised, controlled trials of interventions in pregnant women with a history of pregnancy loss and APL.</P>

<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Two review authors independently assessed quality and extracted data for studies up to December 1999. One review author performed this for studies after 1999.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Thirteen studies were found (849 participants). The quality was not high; 50% had clear evidence of allocation concealment. Participant characteristics varied between trials. </P>
<P>Unfractionated heparin combined with aspirin (two trials; n = 140) significantly reduced pregnancy loss compared to aspirin alone (relative risk (RR) 0.46, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.29 to 0.71). Low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) combined with aspirin compared to aspirin (one trial; n = 98) did not significantly reduce pregnancy loss (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.39 to 1.57). There was no advantage in high-dose, over low-dose, unfractionated heparin (one trial; n = 50). Three trials of aspirin alone (n = 135) showed no significant reduction in pregnancy loss (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.68). Prednisone and aspirin (three trials; n = 286) resulted in a significant increase in prematurity when compared to placebo, aspirin, and heparin combined with aspirin, and an increase in gestational diabetes, but no significant benefit. Intravenous immunoglobulin +/- unfractionated heparin and aspirin (two trials; n = 58) was associated with an increased risk of pregnancy loss or premature birth when compared to unfractionated heparin or LMWH combined with aspirin (RR 2.51, 95% CI 1.27 to 4.95). When compared to prednisone and aspirin, intravenous immunoglobulin (one trial; n = 82) was not significantly different in outcomes.</P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2009-09-10 11:27:29 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND>
<P>The association between antiphospholipid antibodies or lupus anticoagulant and recurrent fetal loss has been acknowledged for many years, and various interventions have been recommended to assist in the maintenance of the pregnancy until delivery of a live infant. </P>
<P>Historically, the association between recurrent fetal loss and antiphospholipid antibodies predated the anticardiolipin antibody assay and the diagnosis was reliant on the presence of the lupus anticoagulant and/or a 'false positive' VDRL (a non-specific serological assay for syphilis) test for syphilis (<LINK REF="REF-Laurell-1957" TYPE="REFERENCE">Laurell 1957</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lubbe-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lubbe 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nilsson-1975" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nilsson 1975</LINK>). With advancing technology, it became possible to detect anticardiolipin antibodies. Other antiphospholipid antibodies and beta-2-glycoprotein I antibodies can now be detected, but their role in recurrent miscarriage remains controversial (<LINK REF="REF-Forastiero-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Forastiero 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Higashino-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higashino 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lynch-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lynch 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Yetman-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yetman 1996</LINK>). Consequently, detection of either lupus anticoagulant or anticardiolipin antibodies in women with recurrent miscarriage remains the main diagnostic indicator for intervention. </P>
<P>The prevalence of anticardiolipin antibodies in general obstetric clinics has been reported to be between 2.7% and 7% (<LINK REF="REF-Lockwood-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lockwood 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lynch-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lynch 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Yasuda-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yasuda 1995</LINK>). Prospective studies of low-risk pregnancies have found their presence carried a three to nine times greater risk of fetal loss (<LINK REF="REF-Lockwood-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lockwood 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lynch-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lynch 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lynch-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lynch 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Yasuda-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yasuda 1995</LINK>). Women with a history of at least three prior miscarriages and no abnormality other than the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies are highly likely to have a future miscarriage. In a prospective study of 20 women who declined treatment, 90% miscarried and 94% of the fetal losses occurred in the first trimester (<LINK REF="REF-Rai-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rai 1995</LINK>). This finding is controversial as is the reported association between anticardiolipin antibodies and maternal complications or low birthweight infants (<LINK REF="REF-Lockwood-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lockwood 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lynch-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lynch 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lynch-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lynch 1999</LINK>). </P>
<P>Antiphospholipid antibodies are associated with venous and arterial thrombosis. In pregnancy, thrombosis of placental vessels may result in placental insufficiency, which can lead to fetal death. Placental pathology is variable but can include infarction with utero-placental thrombus, perivillous fibrin deposits, and even chronic inflammatory lesions (<LINK REF="REF-Nilsson-1975" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nilsson 1975</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Salafia-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Salafia 1997</LINK>). Annexin-V, an anticoagulant phospholipid-binding protein found on normal placental villi, appears to be reduced in the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies and it has been postulated that this may play a role in the placental insufficiency and consequent fetal loss (<LINK REF="REF-Rand-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rand 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rand-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rand 1997</LINK>). There is also 'in vitro' evidence that these antibodies may inhibit proliferation of trophoblasts which could result in impaired implantation (<LINK REF="REF-Chamley-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chamley 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>The first successful treatment in 1975 involved preterm caesarean section in a woman who had experienced three prior fetal losses (<LINK REF="REF-Nilsson-1975" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nilsson 1975</LINK>). Subsequently, the combination of prednisone and aspirin was reported, in 1983, to be successful in a case-series of five out of six participants (<LINK REF="REF-Lubbe-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lubbe 1983</LINK>). Concerns with respect to the effect of prednisone on both the mother and the child resulted in exploration of alternative therapy. In 1988, low-dose aspirin alone was reported to have a dramatic effect on pregnancy outcome in women with a poor obstetric history, which included some with anticardiolipin antibody (<LINK REF="REF-Elder-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elder 1988</LINK>). In the same year, three case reports of the successful use of intravenous immunoglobulin therapy were published (<LINK REF="REF-Carreras-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carreras 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Francois-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Francois 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Scott-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scott 1988</LINK>). Unfractionated heparin therapy was promoted in 1990 (<LINK REF="REF-Rosove-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rosove 1990</LINK>) and, in 1992, the use of low molecular weight heparin was described (<LINK REF="REF-Many-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Many 1992</LINK>). In the same year, the successful use of plasmapheresis in one participant was reported (<LINK REF="REF-Kobayashi-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kobayashi 1992</LINK>). </P>
<P>In considering treatment both efficacy and adverse outcomes need to be considered. There is potential for morbidity in both mother and fetus with these treatments, especially prednisone with its effect on blood sugar, blood pressure and bone density. In addition heparin carries potential risks of haemorrhage, thrombocytopenia and osteoporosis. Although there is extensive experience in the use of low-dose aspirin in the treatment and prevention of pre-eclampsia without excessive adverse outcomes in mother or neonate, its safety when used in this setting can not be assumed. Plasmapheresis is invasive and increases the risk of infection while thrombosis in particular is a potential risk with high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin. The best way to assess the balance of benefit and risk is via a systematic review of randomised controlled trials.</P>
<P>A number of relatively small randomised controlled studies have been performed looking at some, but not all, of the proposed treatments. Findings have not always been consistent. Current management generally includes heparin combined with aspirin. There has been a move towards using low molecular weight heparin because of the advantage of once daily dosing and a perception that it may have less effect on bone mineral density (<LINK REF="REF-Nelson_x002d_Piercy-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nelson-Piercy 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shefras-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shefras 1996</LINK>). This systematic review, which looks at all potential therapies, is necessary to highlight the benefits and in particular, the risks, of the different regimens, and to explore the many areas where the evidence is not yet available, and further research is required.</P>

<DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>From the initial search, two review authors independently reviewed the titles and abstracts from the database searches to determine whether the inclusion criteria were satisfied, and agreement was assessed by the kappa statistic. The full text of identified articles, including those where there was disagreement in the initial title/abstract scanning, were then reviewed independently by two review authors to ensure inclusion criteria were met. Where necessary the author was contacted for additional information. Agreement was assessed by the kappa statistic and disagreements were dealt with by consensus and, where necessary, involvement of a third review author. One review author reviewed contents pages of all issues of Lupus. Two review authors independently reviewed abstracts and, as necessary, full articles of the selected titles for fulfillment of the inclusion criteria. One review author scanned conference proceedings and included if adequate information was obtained either from the abstract or from personal communication. One review author identified articles from other sources (experts or reference lists) as possible and then two review authors assessed them independentlay against the inclusion criteria as above. Blinding to authors, journal of origin or institutions did not occur. Two review authors independently assessed abstracts of non-English articles for fulfillment of the inclusion criteria; full article translation was not required as none fulfilled the criteria.</P>
<P>Two independent review authors extracted study characteristics and data from included studies including assessments of quality. Disagreements were resolved by involvement of a third review author and consensus. We contacted trial authors where information was lacking or data insufficient.</P>
<P>We assessed several aspects of study quality in the studies fulfilling the inclusion criteria. These included generation of randomisation sequence, allocation concealment, blinding of participant, investigator, and outcome assessor, less than 20% loss to follow up, and analysis by intention to treat. Each criterion was graded according to the Cochrane recommendations: A - criterion met, B - partially met or unclear and C - not met. Agreement between the two review authors was assessed with the kappa statistic. Despite this quality assessment, no study was excluded on the basis of quality. </P>
<P>One review author performed a subsequent database search from December 1999 to June 2003. The same author applied the inclusion criteria, quality assessment and data extraction in an identical manner to that performed previously but without the second review author. </P>
<P>We reported outcome variables using the random-effects model as a more conservative estimate taking into account between-study variability. All estimates of effect for dichotomous variables are summarised as relative risks, except where there was evidence of heterogeneity (Q statistic exceeding the degrees of freedom). The measure of effect for the continuous variable, birthweight, is a weighted mean difference. We were unable to assess bone mineral densitometry in this way as it was not measured consistently in any study. We assessed heterogeneity of individual studies by visualisation of the summary graphs and assessment of the Q statistic. Due to the low sensitivity of this statistic, heterogeneity was assumed to be present where Q exceeded the degrees of freedom, rather than relying upon statistical significance. Where heterogeneity was present results were not pooled. Exploration of reasons for heterogeneity by subgroup analysis was not possible due to the paucity of studies. Similarly, subgroup analysis to assess the effect of poorer quality studies on the estimate of effect was not possible. Hypothesis-generating subgroup analysis using the following criteria was not possible due to insufficient data: (1) women with three or more embryonic losses compared to those with less; (2) women with moderate or high-positive anticardiolipin antibody (at levels greater than 15 G phospholipid units (GPL) or greater than 6 M phospholipid units (MPL)) compared to those with low level (less than 15 GPL or less than 6 MPL) anticardiolipin antibody and negative lupus inhibitor; (3) women with moderate or high-positive anticardiolipin antibody (at levels greater than 15 GPL or greater than 6 MPL) compared to those with negative anticardiolipin antibody but positive lupus inhibitor; (4) unfractionated heparin compared to low molecular weight heparin; (5) fixed heparin doses compared to doses which vary according to laboratory monitoring and (6) different fixed heparin doses. We were not able to explore meta-regression to explore the effect of baseline risk due to insufficient trials. Publication bias assessment via a funnel plot was also not possible with so few trials.</P>

In the initial computerized database search (up to 1999), 551 studies were identified as potentially relevant (k = 0.62) and a further 24 studies were identified by bibliography checks. Ten studies from this initial search were included (k = 0.92). In the subsequent database search (up to June 2003) an additional 400 studies were identified as potentially relevant; however, a number of these were duplicates. Three additional studies published since 1999 were identified.</P>
<P>(Fifteen reports from an updated search in September 2009 have been added to <LINK TAG="AWAITING_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Studies awaiting classification</LINK>.)</P>
<P>The study designs, inclusion and exclusion criteria and interventions are shown in the 'Characteristics of included studies' table. A total of 849 participants were enrolled in the 13 trials. Three trials compared aspirin with placebo or standard care (n = 135) (<LINK REF="STD-Cowchock-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Cowchock 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pattison-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Pattison 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tulppala-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Tulppala 1997</LINK>). Six explored the efficacy of heparin combined with aspirin; two of these used low molecular weight (LWM) heparin combined with aspirin (n = 140) and compared this to aspirin alone (<LINK REF="STD-Farquharson-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Farquharson 2002</LINK>) or intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) (<LINK REF="STD-Triolo-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Triolo 2003</LINK>). The others used unfractionated heparin combined with aspirin; two compared the combination to aspirin alone (n = 140) (<LINK REF="STD-Kutteh-1996a" TYPE="STUDY">Kutteh 1996a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rai-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Rai 1997</LINK>), one compared low-dose with high-dose heparin both combined with aspirin (n = 50) (<LINK REF="STD-Kutteh-1996b" TYPE="STUDY">Kutteh 1996b</LINK>), and one compared the combination with prednisone and aspirin (n = 45) (<LINK REF="STD-Cowchock--1992" TYPE="STUDY">Cowchock 1992</LINK>). Two trials compared prednisone and aspirin with placebo or aspirin (n = 241) (<LINK REF="STD-Laskin-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Laskin 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Silver-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Silver 1993</LINK>). Three trials used IVIG; in one study all participants received aspirin and heparin with the addition of either IVIG or placebo (n = 16) (<LINK REF="STD-Branch-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Branch 2000</LINK>). Another study included above compared IVIG to LMW heparin and aspirin (n = 42) (<LINK REF="STD-Triolo-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Triolo 2003</LINK>). The third study compared IVIG to prednisone and aspirin (n = 82) (<LINK REF="STD-Vaquero-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Vaquero 2001</LINK>). No trials of plasma exchange were identified.</P>
<P>Two trials that were included had some participants who were antiphospholipid antibody (APL) negative (<LINK REF="STD-Laskin-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Laskin 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tulppala-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Tulppala 1997</LINK>). For the primary outcome, pregnancy loss, subgroup data from the APL positive participants were used (n = 12/66 (<LINK REF="STD-Tulppala-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Tulppala 1997</LINK>) and 88/202 (<LINK REF="STD-Laskin-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Laskin 1997</LINK>)); for all other outcomes including the composite ones, the complete study data were used. Two other trials included some participants who had not experienced a fetal loss, (n = 10/19 (<LINK REF="STD-Cowchock-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Cowchock 1997</LINK>) and 1/16 (<LINK REF="STD-Branch-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Branch 2000</LINK>)). Subgroup data were not available in these studies and therefore data from all participants were used.</P>
<P>Characteristics of the trial participants, summarized in <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>, were not available from all studies. The mean number of pregnancy losses per woman ranged from 0.6 to 4 (<LINK REF="STD-Cowchock--1992" TYPE="STUDY">Cowchock 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cowchock-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Cowchock 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Farquharson-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Farquharson 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kutteh-1996a" TYPE="STUDY">Kutteh 1996a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kutteh-1996b" TYPE="STUDY">Kutteh 1996b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Laskin-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Laskin 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rai-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Rai 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Triolo-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Triolo 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vaquero-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Vaquero 2001</LINK>). The proportion of women with only first trimester pregnancy losses ranged from 49% to 67% in the four studies that described this (<LINK REF="STD-Cowchock--1992" TYPE="STUDY">Cowchock 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kutteh-1996a" TYPE="STUDY">Kutteh 1996a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kutteh-1996b" TYPE="STUDY">Kutteh 1996b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rai-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Rai 1997</LINK>). A previous successful pregnancy had occurred in between 26% and 69% in the five studies that described this (<LINK REF="STD-Cowchock-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Cowchock 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kutteh-1996a" TYPE="STUDY">Kutteh 1996a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kutteh-1996b" TYPE="STUDY">Kutteh 1996b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Laskin-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Laskin 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rai-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Rai 1997</LINK>). Anticardiolipin (ACL) antibody levels ranged from a median of 12.5 to a mean of 60.2 G phospholipid units (GPL) units in five trials reporting this (<LINK REF="STD-Branch-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Branch 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kutteh-1996a" TYPE="STUDY">Kutteh 1996a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kutteh-1996b" TYPE="STUDY">Kutteh 1996b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rai-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Rai 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Triolo-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Triolo 2003</LINK>), reflecting the various definitions of positive ACL antibody used in the inclusion criteria of individual trials. One study reported that 89% of participants had at least moderate level ACL antibodies (greater than 20 GPL/M phospholipid units) (<LINK REF="STD-Vaquero-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Vaquero 2001</LINK>). Ten studies reported the frequency of an isolated lupus anticoagulant; this ranged from 0% (criteria for exclusion in two studies) (<LINK REF="STD-Kutteh-1996a" TYPE="STUDY">Kutteh 1996a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kutteh-1996b" TYPE="STUDY">Kutteh 1996b</LINK>) to 82% (<LINK REF="STD-Farquharson-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Farquharson 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Laskin-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Laskin 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pattison-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Pattison 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rai-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Rai 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Silver-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Silver 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Triolo-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Triolo 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tulppala-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Tulppala 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vaquero-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Vaquero 2001</LINK>).</P>

<STUDY_QUALITY>
<P>The quality of the included trials was variable as shown in <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>. Three quasi-randomised studies did not conceal allocation of therapy (<LINK REF="STD-Kutteh-1996a" TYPE="STUDY">Kutteh 1996a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kutteh-1996b" TYPE="STUDY">Kutteh 1996b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vaquero-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Vaquero 2001</LINK>). Only one study had any loss to follow up (<LINK REF="STD-Triolo-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Triolo 2003</LINK>). Four studies did not analyse by intent to treat (<LINK REF="STD-Cowchock--1992" TYPE="STUDY">Cowchock 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pattison-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Pattison 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Silver-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Silver 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Triolo-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Triolo 2003</LINK>); two stated the analysis was performed both with and without excluded participants but did not publish the data (<LINK REF="STD-Pattison-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Pattison 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Silver-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Silver 1993</LINK>), and one provided outcome data on all participants according to their allocation group so that the data entered for the meta-analysis was by intent to treat (<LINK REF="STD-Cowchock--1992" TYPE="STUDY">Cowchock 1992</LINK>). It was not clear from the information provided in the quasi-randomised studies whether there was loss to follow up or an analysis by intent to treat was performed as the total number of participants presenting during the recruitment phase (the denominator) was not published (<LINK REF="STD-Kutteh-1996a" TYPE="STUDY">Kutteh 1996a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kutteh-1996b" TYPE="STUDY">Kutteh 1996b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vaquero-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Vaquero 2001</LINK>).<BR/>

<P>Thirteen studies, involving 849 participants, were included. The first set of analyses graphs summarises the effects of the different comparisons on the primary outcome (pregnancy loss).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Heparin</HEADING>
<P>Of the interventions examined, only unfractionated heparin combined with aspirin was shown to reduce the incidence of pregnancy loss (relative risk (RR) 0.46, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.29 to 0.71) when compared with aspirin alone. Low molecular weight (LMW) heparin combined with aspirin had no statistically significant effect when compared to aspirin alone (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.39 to 1.57) or intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) (RR 0.37, 95% CI 0.12 to 1.16); however, the point estimates are in the direction of benefit, although the confidence intervals are wide. No head-to-head study comparing LMW and unfractionated heparin met our inclusion criteria and, therefore, the relative effects of unfractionated versus LMW heparin are unknown. The treatment advantage of unfractionated heparin was maintained with the composite adverse pregnancy outcomes of 'pregnancy loss or intrauterine growth restriction' (IUGR) (RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.39 to 0.83) and 'pregnancy loss or premature delivery' (RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.47 to 0.91). The LMW studies did not provide IUGR data but they did include premature delivery data. The risk of 'pregnancy loss or premature delivery' when LMW heparin combined with aspirin is compared to aspirin or IVIG is very similar to the unfractionated heparin studies although they do not reach statistical significance (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.39 to 1.29 and RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.18 to 1.34 respectively). When the LMW and unfractionated heparin studies are pooled there is a 35% reduction in pregnancy loss or premature delivery (RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.86). High-dose unfractionated heparin did not differ from low-dose unfractionated heparin in its effects. Thrombocytopenia was either not reported or did not occur except for in one study where it was described as mild in two participants receiving LMW heparin (<LINK REF="STD-Triolo-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Triolo 2003</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Aspirin alone</HEADING>
<P>Aspirin, when compared to placebo or standard care, had no significant effect on any of the outcomes examined even after exclusion of the study that had participants without antiphospholipid antibodies (<LINK REF="STD-Tulppala-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Tulppala 1997</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Prednisone</HEADING>
<P>Prednisone and aspirin compared to placebo or aspirin alone did not have a significant effect on the risk of pregnancy loss (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.36). A similar lack of effect was found when compared to heparin and aspirin (RR 1.17, 95% CI 0.47 to 2.93). However, there was significant increase in premature delivery in all prednisone groups and when this adverse pregnancy outcome was combined with pregnancy loss the control treatment (aspirin RR 4.89, 95% CI 1.59 to 15.06; placebo RR 1.49, 95% CI 1.19 to 1.86; heparin and aspirin RR 1.99, 95% CI 1.22 to 3.25) was favoured. A summary estimate was not appropriate though because of significant heterogeneity between the aspirin or placebo groups (Q 4.26, df 1) and a clear difference between these and the study using heparin/aspirin in the control group.</P>
<P>Other adverse outcomes were increased in prednisone treated participants. The neonatal intensive care unit admission in one study was nine times more likely in the prednisone treated group than the placebo group (95% CI 2.14 to 37.78) (<LINK REF="STD-Laskin-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Laskin 1997</LINK>). The rate of pre-eclampsia and hypertension was higher in the prednisone treated participants compared to others as documented below. Prednisone was also associated with a 3.3 times (95% CI 1.53 to 6.98) greater risk of gestational diabetes when compared with placebo, aspirin alone, heparin and aspirin, or IVIG (<LINK REF="STD-Cowchock--1992" TYPE="STUDY">Cowchock 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Laskin-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Laskin 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Silver-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Silver 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vaquero-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Vaquero 2001</LINK>). Birthweight was significantly less in the prednisone and aspirin-treated groups compared to aspirin (weighted mean difference (WMD) -552.00, 95% CI -1064.79 to -39.21) (<LINK REF="STD-Silver-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Silver 1993</LINK>) or IVIG (WMD -351.00, 95% CI -587.94 to -114.06) (<LINK REF="STD-Vaquero-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Vaquero 2001</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG)</HEADING>
<P>IVIG studies used a range of treatments in the control groups and it is therefore not appropriate to combine any of these studies together. There was no reduction in pregnancy loss in any of the studies; however, one study had no pregnancy loss in either the treatment group or the control group (<LINK REF="STD-Branch-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Branch 2000</LINK>). This was a small study (n = 16) and all participants received heparin and aspirin in addition to the study/control medication. This study demonstrated a significant increase in premature delivery (RR 3.00, 95% CI 1.19 to 7.56). There was no significant heterogeneity between this study and the study comparing IVIG with LMW heparin and aspirin (<LINK REF="STD-Triolo-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Triolo 2003</LINK>) when the composite outcome pregnancy loss or premature delivery was explored (Q .33, df 1). In these two studies IVIG increased the risk of pregnancy loss or premature delivery two and a half times (95% CI 1.27 to 4.95). In contrast IVIG did not significantly differ from prednisone and aspirin in outcomes (<LINK REF="STD-Vaquero-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Vaquero 2001</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Other adverse outcomes</HEADING>
<P>No participants died in any of the studies and significant hemorrhage did not occur in mother or neonate. Maternal fracture was not reported and this was generally not analyzed. Only two studies performed bone mineral densitometry, and this was restricted to the heparin-receiving participants only (<LINK REF="STD-Rai-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Rai 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Triolo-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Triolo 2003</LINK>). A median decrease of 5.4% of lumbar spine bone mineral densitometry was documented in one study using unfractionated heparin (<LINK REF="STD-Rai-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Rai 1997</LINK>) and no change was noted in the other which used LMW heparin (<LINK REF="STD-Triolo-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Triolo 2003</LINK>). Our definition used for hypertension was not adopted in any trial, but pre-eclampsia, variously defined or undefined, was reported in some trials. Three heparin trials when pooled reported seven cases of pre-eclampsia in 190 women (<LINK REF="STD-Kutteh-1996a" TYPE="STUDY">Kutteh 1996a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kutteh-1996b" TYPE="STUDY">Kutteh 1996b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rai-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Rai 1997</LINK>). The rates were a little higher in two aspirin-only trials with three of twenty in each of the placebo and aspirin groups in one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Pattison-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Pattison 2000</LINK>) and one of 33 compared to three of 33 in the aspirin and placebo groups respectively of another trial (<LINK REF="STD-Tulppala-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Tulppala 1997</LINK>). The rate of pre-eclampsia was higher in the prednisone and aspirin treated participants compared to those receiving heparin and aspirin (32% versus 4%) (<LINK REF="STD-Cowchock--1992" TYPE="STUDY">Cowchock 1992</LINK>). Hypertension was higher in the prednisone and aspirin treated participants compared to placebo (13% versus 5%) (<LINK REF="STD-Laskin-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Laskin 1997</LINK>) and to IVIG (14% versus 5%) (<LINK REF="STD-Vaquero-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Vaquero 2001</LINK>). In the other IVIG studies there were eight cases of pre-eclampsia; 3/7 IVIG participants compared to 1/9 placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Branch-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Branch 2000</LINK>) and 1/21 IVIG compared to 0/19 LMW heparin (<LINK REF="STD-Triolo-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Triolo 2003</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Subgroup analyses</HEADING>
<P>It was not possible to establish whether interventions were of similar efficacy in preventing early (before 14 weeks) compared with later pregnancy losses as there were insufficient losses after 14 weeks in the trials. Likewise, there were insufficient trials per therapeutic group to explore possible effect modification by study quality, varying heparin doses, and participant characteristics such as the number of prior pregnancy losses, or antibody type and level.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>The major finding in this systematic review is that the combination of unfractionated heparin and aspirin reduced pregnancy loss by 54%. However, this is based on only two small trials and one of these lacked adequate allocation concealment. There is a suggestion that low molecular weight (LMW) heparin also has a beneficial effect; however, this finding was not statistically significant and uncertainty remains.</P>
<P>A head-to-head trial comparing LMW and unfractionated heparin for prophylaxis in pregnancy has been published in abstract form only (<LINK REF="STD-De-Veciana-2001" TYPE="STUDY">De Veciana 2001</LINK>). Insufficient information was available to determine whether this study fulfilled our criteria (especially what proportion of women had antiphospholipid antibody syndrome) and an attempt to contact the author for additional information failed. Consequently this trial could not be included; however, the abstract suggests there may be clinical differences between these agents when used prophylactically in thrombophilia associated with pregnancy. The absence of a good head-to-head trial comparing LMW and unfractionated heparin results in uncertainty in the relative effects of these two treatment modalities. There are biological differences in pharmacologic effect of these forms of heparin for example their ability to bind to thrombin and other proteins; however, clinical trials show them to be at least of equivalence as antithrombotic agents in non-pregnant women (<LINK REF="REF-Hirsh-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hirsh 1998</LINK>). During pregnancy the effects of differences in protein binding may be greater; studies here have not been adequate to prove equivalence as antithrombotic agents in this group (<LINK REF="REF-Ensom-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ensom 1999</LINK>). In addition, in recurrent miscarriage due to antiphospholipid (APL) syndrome, the antithrombotic effect of the heparins may not be the main mode of action. There is <I>in vitro</I> evidence that APL antibodies affect trophoblast differentiation, proliferation and invasion all of which may adversely affect the early pregnancy (<LINK REF="REF-Chamley-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chamley 2002</LINK>). In vitro studies have shown that LMW heparin can restore trophoblast function but no comparison with unfractionated heparin has been made (<LINK REF="REF-Di-Simone-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Di Simone 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Di-Simone-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Di Simone 1999</LINK>). Currently, therefore, one can not assume that the LMW heparin and unfractionated heparin have equivalent biological effects. </P>
<P>In addition, there are differences between studies in the diagnostic criteria for lupus anticoagulant (LA) and anticardiolipin (ACL), which determined participant populations. These may have influenced the baseline risk; the control rate of pregnancy loss is lower in the <LINK REF="STD-Farquharson-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Farquharson 2002</LINK> study (28%) in which the majority of participants had low positive ACL antibodies compared to <LINK REF="STD-Kutteh-1996a" TYPE="STUDY">Kutteh 1996a</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Triolo-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Triolo 2003</LINK> and the ratio used to define the LA was lower than that used by <LINK REF="STD-Rai-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Rai 1997</LINK>. The control rates of pregnancy loss in the other three studies were 43% (<LINK REF="STD-Triolo-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Triolo 2003</LINK>), 56% (<LINK REF="STD-Kutteh-1996a" TYPE="STUDY">Kutteh 1996a</LINK>) and 57% (<LINK REF="STD-Rai-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Rai 1997</LINK>) . These differences may have influenced the size of the effect if they are effect modifiers. Unfortunately, there were insufficient studies to address this possibility and individual participant data meta-analysis is required. Thus population differences, rather than biological differences between the drugs, may have influenced the differences in estimates of effect. In addition, one LMW heparin study used intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) instead of aspirin in the control arm, (<LINK REF="STD-Triolo-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Triolo 2003</LINK>) and it may not be valid to combine this study with the other heparin studies. </P>
<P>The improvement in pregnancy outcome with unfractionated heparin is associated with a non-significant increase in risk of prematurity and intrauterine growth retardation (relative risk (RR) 2.2 and 3.0 respectively) but this may be a result of prolongation of pregnancies, which if untreated would have been lost and this could therefore bias the adverse outcomes such as prematurity, intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), etc, to appear more common with the drug most successful in preventing pregnancy loss. An alternative way of assessing these outcomes could be to assess the risk in the subgroup with a live birth. However, baseline risk is unlikely to be similar in the two comparative subgroups with live births. The control subgroup may only contain those with a low baseline risk compared to the effective treatment group where there may be participants with high baseline risk also. Consequently, the effect of randomisation on confounders is lost and the comparison is prone to bias. Therefore we considered it more appropriate to use composite outcomes. All pregnancy related adverse outcomes could not be combined due to overlap in outcomes for example premature babies may also be included in the IUGR and caesarean outcomes etc. Therefore two composite outcomes were used; pregnancy loss or premature delivery, and pregnancy loss or IUGR. </P>
<P>The risk of pregnancy loss or premature delivery is reduced by 35% in those treated with either form of heparin combined with aspirin. The effect of LMW heparin on IUGR could not be assessed as neither study supplied these data; however, unfractionated heparin combined with aspirin reduced pregnancy loss or IUGR by 43%. </P>
<P>Potential heparin related hazards, including significant maternal thrombocytopenia and haemorrhage, did not occur. The possibility of osteoporosis developing while on long-term heparin is of concern. Fractures were not reported but may have been missed. Only one unfractionated heparin trial measured the bone mineral density (<LINK REF="STD-Rai-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Rai 1997</LINK>); controls were not assessed but the finding of a 5.4% decrease in lumbar spine bone mineral density in those treated with heparin is concordant with a prospective study demonstrating a 5% decrease in lumbar bone mineral density in LMW heparin treated pregnant participants, compared to 3% in the pregnant controls (<LINK REF="REF-Shefras-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shefras 1996</LINK>). One LMW heparin study assessed bone mineral density in 12/19 participants receiving heparin but once more did not assess this in the controls (<LINK REF="STD-Triolo-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Triolo 2003</LINK>). Instead the bone mineral density at 14 weeks' gestation was compared to a postnatal assessment and no change was documented.</P>
<P>In determining the potential benefit versus hazard to an individual, baseline risk is important (<LINK REF="REF-Glasziou-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glasziou 1995</LINK>). A prospective cohort of women attending a general antenatal outpatient clinic who were found to be ACL positive, (20% of whom had a previous pregnancy loss) had a subsequent rate of pregnancy loss of 28% (low-risk) (<LINK REF="REF-Yasuda-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yasuda 1995</LINK>). Treatment of 100 women of such risk with combined unfractionated heparin and aspirin would benefit 15. In contrast a high-risk cohort (20 women who refused treatment and were positive for either ACL, LA or both with at least three previous pregnancy losses) had a subsequent pregnancy loss rate of 90% (<LINK REF="REF-Rai-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rai 1995</LINK>). Treatment of 100 would benefit 49. If the baseline risk is taken as a more conservative number, 52% (the mean of the three highest control rates in the heparin trials), treatment would benefit 28 of the 100 treated. Hazards associated with treatment occur infrequently and the risk cannot be assessed in this manner. </P>
<P>The optimal dose of heparin to maximise benefit and minimise harm is unknown. Various regimens were used in these studies but this did not alter the outcomes significantly as demonstrated by the absence of significant heterogeneity. The study which compared high-dose to low-dose heparin had methodological problems (quasi-randomised with lack of allocation concealment) but also lacked the power to detect a significant difference (<LINK REF="STD-Kutteh-1996b" TYPE="STUDY">Kutteh 1996b</LINK>). Similarly it remains unknown whether LMW heparin can be substituted for unfractionated heparin. </P>
<P>A small benefit with aspirin alone or IVIG cannot be excluded on the basis of the available studies. However, what is available suggests that IVIG with or without heparin and aspirin is inferior to LMW heparin combined with aspirin or unfractionated heparin and aspirin alone (pregnancy loss or premature delivery RR 2.5, confidence interval 1.27 to 4.95). The two studies from which this is derived are small and further studies are required. However, given the uncertainty, IVIG treatment for APL antibody associated pregnancy loss should only occur as part of a randomised controlled trial. </P>
<P>In the trials of prednisone and aspirin no benefit was shown irrespective of whether the control group received aspirin, placebo, heparin and aspirin, or IVIG. Any small benefit that may have been missed in this systematic review is likely to be negated by the increase in adverse neonatal and maternal outcomes. When the outcome pregnancy loss or premature delivery was considered all control treatments (aspirin, placebo and heparin and aspirin) with the exception of IVIG, significantly reduced the risk compared to prednisone and aspirin. Gestational diabetes and other adverse outcomes were increased even at doses of prednisone as low as 10 mg/day. Based on these results prednisone appears to have no role in the treatment of recurrent pregnancy loss associated with APL antibodies. However, when other indications are present such as active systemic lupus erythematosus, the potential benefits will need to be weighed against the potential harms.</P>
<P>The terminology and inclusion criteria for this review were broad. One of the aims was to explore various participant characteristics, as subgroups, to look for evidence of effect modification, and as indicators of baseline risk. This was not possible due to the small number of studies retrieved and the aggregate data used. Efficacy studies which focus on the current proposed classification of antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (<LINK REF="REF-Wilson-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wilson 1999</LINK>) which requires at least three consecutive early (less than 10 weeks) fetal losses or at least one late (greater than 10 weeks) fetal loss may limit applicability assessments. Similarly the ACl cut-offs for defining the syndrome are much higher than used in most of these studies. It is not known whether the antibody levels have a modifying effect on the treatment. Women who do not fall into the 'syndrome' classification may still benefit from treatment and this needs to be explored. There is currently no evidence that efficacy is limited to certain subsets of participants only, and the level of baseline risk below which potential harms outweigh potential benefits is unknown. </P>
<P>This systematic review has several potential limitations. The number of trials and enrolled participants were small limiting the precision of all estimates. The partial failure to identify significant effects may be due to a type 2 errors. The quality of trials was variable; three included trials were quasi-randomised only and allocation concealment, a potent source of bias if not incorporated (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>), was adequate in only 50% of all trials. Despite this, the studies within their therapeutic groups were generally consistent but there was evidence of heterogeneity in outcomes particularly in the heparin trials. Two trials included some participants without a history of pregnancy loss but their effect was likely only to reduce the baseline risk rather than introduce bias into the relative effect measure. On the other hand, two studies included participants who were APL antibody negative. Effect-modification by the APL antibody may result in bias from inclusion of these studies but this would not affect the primary outcome, pregnancy loss, where it was possible to extract data for those who were antibody positive. With respect to the other outcome measures, if the effect is purely related to the treatment then no bias is likely. Alternatively if the APL antibody itself has an effect on prematurity and intrauterine growth retardation, then the inclusion of these studies may result in a bias towards the null reducing the apparent efficacy of treatment on their occurrence. Lastly, it is unlikely that selection bias occurred as the search strategy was quite intensive and non-English language studies were not excluded on the basis of language. Formal assessment with a funnel plot was not possible due to the small number of trials. </P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2009-09-10 11:13:24 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>The combination of twice-daily unfractionated heparin and low-dose aspirin appears to be of benefit in pregnant women with antiphospholipid antibodies and recurrent pregnancy loss not related to other causes. The benefits in low-risk participants may not be sufficient to warrant its use. LMW may be of benefit but there is no evidence that it has similar efficacy to heparin and its use as a substitute for unfractionated heparin can not be justified based on present data. There is no evidence that other therapies may provide benefit but there is some evidence of harm with prednisone and intravenous immunoglobulin. </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2009-09-10 11:13:24 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Further large trials of heparin (both unfractionated and LMW) combined with aspirin are needed to reduce clinically important uncertainty about the benefits and harms. A large multicentre study comparing unfractionated heparin and aspirin with LMW heparin and aspirin, and aspirin alone is well overdue. Until this is done, debate about the efficacy of LMW heparin, unfractionated heparin and their interchangability will continue.</P>

<P>Since three randomised trials of aspirin versus placebo showed no benefit, aspirin should be avoided and excluded from future trials.<BR/>
<BR/>The conclusion that heparin added to aspirin increases live births and should become standard care for women with recurrent miscarriages associated with antiphospholipid antibodies is premature. The two small trials included only 140 women. No long term follow up was reported or anticipated. The lack of efficacy of low molecular weight heparin in the only randomised trial suggests that the efficacy of unfractionated heparin may have been a statistical aberration. Safety of heparin (which can lead to osteopenia, bleeding, heparin induced thrombocytopenia, and fetal abnormalities) cannot be determined from these small trials. Even if adding heparin to aspirin does increase the chances of live birth in a single pregnancy, in this situation from 30/70 (43%) to 52/70 (74%), it is not significantly better that the chance of a live birth in two pregnancies with aspirin (or placebo) alone (i.e., 1 x [0.57 x 0.57] = 68%).<BR/>
<BR/>For women with recurrent miscarriages, anticoagulants should not be used outside of randomised trials. Given the risks of anticoagulants, the endpoint of any future trials should be a healthy baby in two or three pregnancies, rather than one pregnancy.</P>

<P>The three trials of aspirin versus placebo were small (total n = 135) and so, as stated in discussion in the review &#8220;A small benefit with aspirin alone ... cannot be excluded on the basis of the available studies&#8221;.  Also, the intervention arm of the heparin trials used a combination of heparin (unfractionated or LMW) with aspirin, and compared this to aspirin in the control group.  It is not known whether there is an interaction between heparin and aspirin that might contribute to the reported benefit, and the only way to assess this would be to compare heparin plus aspirin with heparin alone. No such studies have been performed, and therefore current evidence is that there appears to be some benefit with the combination of aspirin and heparin. There is insufficient evidence to state that aspirin has no benefit. Further studies are needed. Trials of aspirin for the prevention of pre-eclampsia suggests that low dose aspirin is safe for the mother and child (<LINK REF="REF-Duley-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Duley 2007</LINK>). </P>
<P>We completely<B> </B>agree it is premature to claim heparin plus aspirin increases live births and should become standard care for women, and have not stated this. What we do state is: &#8220;The combination of twice-daily unfractionated heparin and low-dose aspirin appears to be of benefit in pregnant women with antiphospholipid antibodies and recurrent pregnancy loss not related to other causes. The benefits in low-risk participants may not be sufficient to warrant its use&#8221;. We agree<B> </B>the trials were small, and hence conclude &#8220;Further large trials of heparin (both unfractionated and LMW) combined with aspirin are needed to reduce clinically important uncertainty about the benefits and harms.&#8221; Potential harms from heparin, including long-term outcome, and the importance of considering baseline risk are discussed in paragraph six and seven respectively of the discussion.</P>
<P>The data for LMW heparin should not be interpreted as &#8216;lack of efficacy&#8217;, as this trial was small and the confidence intervals are wide. Lack of evidence of an effect (as here) is not the same as evidence of lack of an effect. In addition, head to head trials comparing LMW heparin and unfractionated heparin for prophylaxis in pregnancy are inadequate and, as discussed in paragraph two of the discussion, they may not have the same biological effects. Therefore, the results of a LMW study do not refute the results of unfractionated heparin studies.</P>
<P>The calculation of the chance of a live birth in a second pregnancy is based on assuming the same risk for both pregnancies, but it is unclear whether this is a valid assumption.</P>
<P>We agree there is a need for further studies, and the next update of this review which is in preparation will include new trials. Nevertheless, the data in the current review should be discussed with women who are considering these interventions, to help them make an informed decision. The benefits of performing a trial over more than one pregnancy are unclear. This would not be a trial attractive to women, who are concerned about their current pregnancy. It would certainly increase the cost, complexity and attrition.  Information about cumulative safety over more than one pregnancy might come from a prospective cohort, rather than an RCT.</P>
