<P>Not enough evidence that relaxin helps ripen the cervix and induce labour.</P>
<P>Relaxin is a hormone secreted by the placenta in the final stages of pregnancy to ripen the neck of the uterus (cervix) and prepare it for labour. It is used to induce labour and is either made from genetically combined human relaxin or from animal preparations. The role of relaxin treatment remains unclear but it is possible that it may relax the muscle tissue of the uterus and therefore not work as well as other methods of induction. The review of trials found there was not enough research to show the true effect of relaxin. More research is needed.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Relaxin is a protein hormone composed of two amino acid chains. The role played by relaxin in human pregnancy and parturition is unclear. Its use and involvement as a cervical ripening agent has been debated since the 1950s. Because the main source of human relaxin is the corpus luteum of pregnancy much of the early work on induction of labour has focused on porcine or bovine preparations. With the advent of DNA recombinant technology human relaxin has become available for evaluation. Relaxin is thought to have a promoting effect on cervical ripening. Due to a possible inhibitory effect on human myometrial activity, relaxin may not be associated with the concomitant increase in the rate of uterine hyperstimulation seen with other induction agents. This is one of a series of reviews of methods of cervical ripening and labour induction using a standardised methodology.</P>

There was no evidence of a difference between the rate of caesarean section in those women given relaxin compared with placebo (15.3% versus 14.2%; relative risk (RR) 0.79, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.42 to 1.50, 4 trials, 257 women). There was a reduction in the risk of the cervix remaining unfavourable or unchanged with induction with relaxin (21.9% versus 49.3%; RR 0.45, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.72, 3 trials, 371 women).

</CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<CRIT_OUTCOMES>
<P>Clinically relevant outcomes for trials of methods of cervical ripening/labour induction have been prespecified by two authors of labour induction reviews (Justus Hofmeyr and Zarko Alfirevic). Differences were settled by discussion.</P>
<P>Five primary outcomes were chosen as being most representative of the clinically important measures of effectiveness and complications: </P>
<P>(1) vaginal delivery not achieved within 24 hours (or period specified by trial authors);<BR/>(2) uterine hyperstimulation with fetal heart rate (FHR) changes;<BR/>(3) caesarean section;<BR/>(4) serious neonatal morbidity or perinatal death (e.g. seizures, birth asphyxia defined by trialists, neonatal encephalopathy, disability in childhood);<BR/>(5) serious maternal morbidity or death (e.g. uterine rupture, admission to intensive care unit, septicaemia).</P>
<P>Perinatal and maternal morbidity and mortality are composite outcomes. This is not an ideal solution because some components are clearly less severe than others. It is possible for one intervention to cause more deaths but less severe morbidity. However, in the context of labour induction at term this is unlikely. All these events will be rare, and a modest change in their incidence will be easier to detect if composite outcomes are presented. The incidence of individual components will be explored as secondary outcomes (see below).</P>
<P>Secondary outcomes relate to measures of effectiveness, complications and satisfaction:</P>
<P>Measures of effectiveness:<BR/>(6) cervix unfavourable/unchanged after 12 to 24 hours;<BR/>(7) oxytocin augmentation.</P>
<P>Complications:<BR/>(8) uterine hyperstimulation without FHR changes;<BR/>(9) uterine rupture;<BR/>(10) epidural analgesia;<BR/>(11) instrumental vaginal delivery;<BR/>(12) meconium stained liquor;<BR/>(13) Apgar score less than seven at five minutes;<BR/>(14) neonatal intensive care unit admission;<BR/>(15) neonatal encephalopathy;<BR/>(16) perinatal death;<BR/>(17) disability in childhood;<BR/>(18) maternal side effects (all);<BR/>(19) maternal nausea;<BR/>(20) maternal vomiting;<BR/>(21) maternal diarrhoea;<BR/>(22) other maternal side-effects;<BR/>(23) postpartum haemorrhage (as defined by the trial authors);<BR/>(24) serious maternal complications (e.g. intensive care unit admission, septicaemia but excluding uterine rupture);<BR/>(25) maternal death.</P>
<P>Measures of satisfaction:<BR/>(26) woman not satisfied;<BR/>(27) caregiver not satisfied.</P>
<P>'Uterine rupture' includes all clinically significant ruptures of unscarred or scarred uteri. Trivial scar dehiscence noted incidentally at the time of surgery is excluded.</P>
<P>Additional outcomes may appear in individual primary reviews, but will not contribute to the secondary reviews.</P>
<P>While all the above outcomes will be sought, only those with data appear in the analysis tables.</P>
<P>The terminology of uterine hyperstimulation is problematic (<LINK REF="REF-Curtis-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Curtis 1987</LINK>). In the reviews we will use the term 'uterine hyperstimulation without FHR changes' to include uterine tachysystole (more than five contractions per 10 minutes for at least 20 minutes) and uterine hypersystole/hypertonus (a contraction lasting at least two minutes) and 'uterine hyperstimulation with FHR changes' to denote uterine hyperstimulation syndrome (tachysystole or hypersystole with fetal heart rate changes such as persistent decelerations, tachycardia or decreased short term variability). However, due to varied reporting there is the possibility of subjective bias in interpretation of these outcomes. Also it is not always clear from trials if these outcomes are reported in a mutually exclusive manner.</P>
<P>Outcomes were included in the analysis: if reasonable measures were taken to minimise observer bias; and data were available for analysis according to original allocation.</P>

<DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>A strategy has been developed to deal with the large volume and complexity of trial data relating to labour induction. Many methods have been studied, examining the effects of these methods when induction of labour was undertaken in a variety of clinical groups e.g. restricted to primiparous women or those with ruptured membranes. Most trials are intervention-driven, comparing two or more methods in various categories of women. Clinicians and parents need the data arranged according to the clinical characteristics of the women undergoing induction of labour, to be able to choose which method is best for a particular clinical scenario. To extract these data from several hundred trial reports in a single step would be very difficult. We developed a two-stage method of data extraction. The initial data extraction was done in a series of primary reviews arranged by methods of induction of labour, following a standardised methodology. The data was then extracted from the primary reviews into a series of secondary reviews, arranged by the clinical characteristics of the women undergoing induction of labour.</P>
<P>To avoid duplication of data in the primary reviews, the labour induction methods were listed in a specific order, from one to 25. Each primary review included comparisons between one of the methods (from two to 25) with only those methods above it on the list. Thus, the review of intravenous oxytocin (4) included only comparisons with intracervical prostaglandins (3), vaginal prostaglandins (2) or placebo (1). Methods identified in the future will be added to the end of the list. The current list is as follows:</P>
<P>(1) placebo/no treatment;<BR/>(2) vaginal prostaglandins;<BR/>(3) intracervical prostaglandins;<BR/>(4) intravenous oxytocin;<BR/>(5) amniotomy;<BR/>(6) intravenous oxytocin with amniotomy;<BR/>(7) vaginal misoprostol;<BR/>(8) oral misoprostol;<BR/>(9) mechanical methods including extra-amniotic Foley catheter;<BR/>(10) membrane sweeping;<BR/>(11) extra-amniotic prostaglandins;<BR/>(12) intravenous prostaglandins;<BR/>(13) oral prostaglandins;<BR/>(14) mifepristone;<BR/>(15) oestrogens with or without amniotomy;<BR/>(16) corticosteroids;<BR/>(17) relaxin;<BR/>(18) hyaluronidase;<BR/>(19) castor oil, bath, and/or enema;<BR/>(20) acupuncture;<BR/>(21) breast stimulation;<BR/>(22) sexual intercourse;<BR/>(23) homoeopathic methods;<BR/>(24) nitric oxide;<BR/>(25) buccal or sublingual misoprostol<BR/>(26) other methods for induction of labour.</P>
<P>The primary reviews were analysed by the following subgroups:<BR/>(1) previous caesarean section or not;<BR/>(2) nulliparity or multiparity;<BR/>(3) membranes intact or ruptured;<BR/>(4) cervix favourable, unfavourable or undefined.</P>
<P>The secondary reviews will include all methods of labour induction for each of the categories of women for which subgroup analysis has been done in the primary reviews. There will thus be six secondary reviews, of methods of labour induction in the following groups of women:</P>
<P>(1) nulliparous, intact membranes (unfavourable cervix, favourable cervix, cervix not defined);<BR/>(2) nulliparous, ruptured membranes (unfavourable cervix, favourable cervix, cervix not defined);<BR/>(3) multiparous, intact membranes (unfavourable cervix, favourable cervix, cervix not defined);<BR/>(4) multiparous, ruptured membranes (unfavourable cervix, favourable cervix, cervix not defined);<BR/>(5) previous caesarean section, intact membranes (unfavourable cervix, favourable cervix, cervix not defined);<BR/>(6) previous caesarean section, ruptured membranes (unfavourable cervix, favourable cervix, cervix not defined).</P>
<P>Each time a primary review is updated with new data, those secondary reviews which include data which have changed, will also be updated.</P>
<P>The trials included in the primary reviews were extracted from an initial set of trials covering all interventions used in induction of labour (see above for details of search strategy). The data extraction process was conducted centrally. This was co-ordinated from the Clinical Effectiveness Support Unit (CESU) at the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, UK, in co-operation with The Pregnancy and Childbirth Group of The Cochrane Collaboration. This process allowed the data extraction process to be standardised across all the reviews. </P>
<P>The trials were initially reviewed on eligibility criteria, using a standardised form and the basic selection criteria specified above. Following this, data were extracted to a standardised data extraction form which was piloted for consistency and completeness. The pilot process involved the researchers at the CESU and previous reviewers in the area of induction of labour.</P>
<P>Information was extracted regarding the methodological quality of trials on a number of levels. This process was completed without consideration of trial results. Assessment of selection bias examined the process involved in the generation of the random sequence and the method of allocation concealment separately. These were then judged as adequate or inadequate using the criteria described in <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK> for the purpose of the reviews. </P>
<P>Performance bias was examined with regards to whom was blinded in the trials i.e. patient, caregiver, outcome assessor or analyst. In many trials the caregiver, assessor and analyst were the same party. Details of the feasibility and appropriateness of blinding at all levels was sought. </P>
<P>Predefined sub-group analyses are: previous caesarean section or not; nulliparity or multiparity; membranes intact or ruptured, and cervix unfavourable, favourable or undefined. Only those outcomes with data appear in the analysis tables.</P>
<P>Individual outcome data were included in the analysis if they met the prestated criteria in 'Types of outcome measures'. Included trial data were processed as described in the Cochrane Reviewers' Handbook (<LINK REF="REF-Clarke-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clarke 2002</LINK>). Data extracted from the trials were analysed on an intention to treat basis (when this was not done in the original report, re-analysis is performed if possible). Where data were missing, clarification is sought from the original authors. If the attrition was such that it might significantly affect the results, these data were excluded from the analysis. This decision rested with the reviewers of primary reviews and is clearly documented. If missing data become available, they will be included in the analyses.</P>
<P>Data were extracted from all eligible trials to examine how issues of quality influence effect size in a sensitivity analysis. In trials where reporting was poor, methodological issues were reported as unclear or clarification sought.</P>
<P>Due to the large number of trials, double data extraction was not feasible and agreement between the three data extractors was therefore assessed on a random sample of trials.</P>
<P>Once the data had been extracted, they were distributed to individual reviewers for entry onto the Review Manager computer software (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2003</LINK>), checked for accuracy, and analysed as above using the RevMan software. For dichotomous data, relative risks and 95% confidence intervals were calculated, and in the absence of heterogeneity, results were pooled using a fixed effects model.</P>
<P>The predefined criteria for sensitivity analysis included all aspects of quality assessment as mentioned above, including aspects of selection, performance and attrition bias.</P>
<P>Primary analysis was limited to the prespecified outcomes and sub-group analyses. In the event of differences in unspecified outcomes or sub-groups being found, these were analysed post hoc, but clearly identified as such to avoid drawing unjustified conclusions.</P>

The other trial examining the effect of human relaxin (<LINK REF="STD-Bell-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Bell 1993</LINK>) used computer generated lists of random numbers but it appears that the allocation was from an open list. The other two trials (<LINK REF="STD-MacLennan-1980" TYPE="STUDY">MacLennan 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Maclennan-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Maclennan 1986</LINK>) were unclear on both the method of generation of the random sequence or the allocation concealment method used.</P>
<P>
<B>Blinding</B>
<BR/>All four trials included a placebo arm in the trial, and all made specific reference to the fact that both patient and investigator were blinded to the treatment given. </P>
</STUDY_QUALITY>
<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
<P>In total, nine studies were considered; five have been excluded and four included examining a total of 267 women. </P>
<P>The initial analysis compared any relaxin formulation with placebo. We also performed a further analysis in two subgroups according to the type of relaxin used i.e. purified porcine or recombinant human relaxin. However, there was no significant difference between the two subgroups for any of the reported outcomes, as reflected by lack of statistical heterogeneity for all reported outcomes. Hence all data have therefore been reported together regardless of the preparation.</P>
<P>Results presented refer to the 'all women' group and unless stated no difference was seen in any of the predefined sub-groups.<BR/>
<B>
<BR/>Primary outcomes</B>
<BR/>There were no reported cases of uterine hyperstimulation with fetal heart rate (FHR) changes in any of the studies. There was no evidence of a difference between the rate of caesarean section in those women given relaxin compared with placebo (15.3% versus 14.2%; relative risk (RR) 0.79, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.42 to 1.50, 4 trials, 257 women). Two trials reported no cases of neonatal mortality or morbidity; overall there were insufficient data to comment on this outcome or the other outcome of maternal mortality or morbidity.</P>
<P>
<B>Secondary outcomes</B>
<BR/>Compared with placebo there was a reduction in the risk of the cervix remaining unfavourable or unchanged following relaxin administration (21.9% versus 49.3%; RR 0.45, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.72, 3 trials, 371 women). Oxytocin augmentation was not reduced with relaxin in comparison with placebo (53.7% versus 70.6%; RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.06, 3 trials, 196 women). There was some apparent heterogeneity between these studies and the trial by MacLennan 1980, which used porcine relaxin differed from the othere two trials which used recombinant human relaxin. however the numbers included are too small to make any major conclusions. There were no reported cases of uterine hyperstimulation without FHR changes in the two trials reporting this outcome. The use of epidural analgesia or the rate of instrumental delivery was not different between cases induced with relaxin in comparison with placebo. There were insufficient data to comment on other neonatal outcomes. Postpartum hemorrhage was reported in one trial and there was no significant difference between relaxin in comparison with placebo.</P>
</INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>
<B>
<BR/>Outcomes</B>
<BR/>Currently available data do not show any significant difference between relaxin and placebo for induction of labour. The only perceived benefit of relaxin in comparison to placebo is an improvement in cervical favourability. </P>
<P>
<B>Sensitivity analysis</B>
<BR/>One of the included trials administered relaxin via an intracervical route (<LINK REF="STD-Maclennan-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Maclennan 1986</LINK>). This may alter the action/efficacy of relaxin in comparison to vaginal administration. Removal of this trial from the results did not statistically alter any of the results and hence we felt it justified to include this trial alongside the other three trials where relaxin was administered vaginally. Any perceived difference of effect between vaginal and intracervical relaxin could only realistically be detected with much larger numbers of trial participants.</P>

<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2009-08-13 22:21:53 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>The place of relaxin, either purified porcine or recombinant human, as an induction or cervical priming agent is unclear and its use outside of clinical trials should be discouraged.</P>
