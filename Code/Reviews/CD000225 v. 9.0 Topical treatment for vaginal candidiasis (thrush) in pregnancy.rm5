<SUMMARY>
<TITLE>Topical treatment for vaginal candidiasis (thrush) in pregnancy</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Imidazoles are best but pregnant women may need longer (7 not 4 day) courses. Thrush is a common vaginal infection in pregnancy causing itching and soreness. There is no evidence that this yeast infection harms the baby. Antifungal creams are effective. Imidazoles (such as clotrimazole) are more effective than older treatments such as nystatin and hydrargaphen. Longer courses (7 days) cured more than 90% of women whereas standard (4 day) courses only cured about half the cases. </P>

<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Ten trials were included. Based on five trials, imidazole drugs were more effective than nystatin when treating vaginal candidiasis in pregnancy (odds ratio 0.21, 95% confidence interval 0.16 to 0.29). In turn, Nystatin was as effective as hydrargaphen in one trial (odds ratio 0.29, 95% confidence interval 0.05-1.84). A trial of clotrimazole was more effective than placebo (odds ratio 0.14, 95% confidence interval 0.06 to 0.31). Single dose treatment was no more or less effective than three or four days treatment. However, two trials involving 81 women, showed that treatment lasting for four days was less effective than treatment for seven days (odds ratio 11.7, 95% confidence interval 4.21 to 29.15). Based on two trials, treatment for seven days was no more or less effective than treatment for 14 days (odds ratio 0.41, 95% confidence interval 0.16 to 1.05). Terconazole was as effective as clotrimazole (odds ratio 1.41, 95% confidence interval 0.28- 7.10).</P>

</ABSTRACT>
<BODY MODIFIED="2009-10-27 14:07:14 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jill V Hampson">
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Vaginal candidiasis (moniliasis) is a common and frequently distressing complaint for many women. It is even more common in pregnancy.</P>
<P>It is caused by a yeast - Candida albicans. This yeast often inhabits warm moist areas of the body such as the mouth, vagina, perineum and groin. Often it is harmless and causes no symptoms. However, it can cause vaginal soreness and itching sometimes with a white curdy discharge and reddening of the labia. In certain circumstances such as pregnancy or after the use of broad spectrum antibiotics, thrush becomes more common.</P>
<P>It is possible that infection can be passed between the penis and vagina but recurrent infection is more likely to be a result of reinfection from the bowel. Preventive measures can therefore include wiping from front to back and avoiding tight underwear (especially synthetics). Excessive washing, use of bubble baths and perfumed soaps may, like antibiotics, damage the natural protective flora of the vagina and should be avoided. There is no evidence that thrush harms the unborn child.</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>To assess the effects of different topical treatments on vaginal candidiasis in pregnancy.</P>

<METHODS MODIFIED="2009-10-27 14:05:15 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jill V Hampson">
<SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<CRIT_STUDIES>
<P>All randomised controlled trials or 'quasi-randomised' studies (e.g. using alternation) comparing any topical treatment either with placebo or with another topical treatment, or with the same treatment over two different treatment periods.</P>
</CRIT_STUDIES>
<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>Pregnant women with symptomatic vaginal candidiasis proven by culture.</P>
</CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>Nystatin was compared with hydrargaphen.<BR/>Two different imidazoles were compared with nystatin.<BR/>Clotrimazole was compared with placebo.<BR/>One day treatment with imidazole was compared with three days treatment.<BR/>Three or four days treatment with imidazole was compared with seven days treatment.<BR/>Seven days treatment by imidazole was compared with 14 days treatment.<BR/>Terconazole was compared with clotrimazole.</P>
</CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<CRIT_OUTCOMES>

</STUDY_QUALITY>
<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
<P>The earliest study (<LINK REF="STD-Milne-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Milne 1973</LINK>) showed that 14 days treatment with nystatin was as effective as hydrargaphen. All four trials comparing imidazoles (<LINK REF="STD-Davis-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Davis 1974</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McNellis-1977" TYPE="STUDY">McNellis 1977</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Qualey-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Qualey 1975</LINK> used miconazole cream while <LINK REF="STD-Tan-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Tan 1974</LINK> used clotrimazole pessaries) with nystatin pessaries showed imidazoles to be more effective as judged by symptom relief and negative culture (<LINK REF="STD-Davis-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Davis 1974</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McNellis-1977" TYPE="STUDY">McNellis 1977</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Qualey-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Qualey 1975</LINK>) or by negative culture alone (<LINK REF="STD-Tan-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Tan 1974</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Ruiz_x002d_Velasco-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Ruiz-Velasco 1978</LINK> showed that clotrimazole was more effective than placebo. <LINK REF="STD-Pasquale-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Pasquale 1978</LINK> using miconazole and <LINK REF="STD-Rubin-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Rubin 1980</LINK> using econazole both showed that a one week course of treatment is as effective as two weeks. However, the same trial by <LINK REF="STD-Pasquale-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Pasquale 1978</LINK> showed that courses of miconazole of four days were not as effective as a one week course. <LINK REF="STD-Lebherz-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Lebherz 1982</LINK> found the same. A later study by the same author (<LINK REF="STD-Lebherz-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Lebherz 1985</LINK>) showed that one day of high dose clotrimazole is as effective as three days at a lower dose. However, this study included nine non pregnant women among the 101 in the trial and it has not therefore been possible to include the results in the tables as data are not presented separately for the pregnant women. <LINK REF="STD-Del-Palacio_x002d_Hernanz" TYPE="STUDY">Del Palacio-Hernanz</LINK> found that terconazole cream was as effective as clotrimazole cream.</P>
</INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>Vaginal candidiasis becomes more common during pregnancy. Though there are now effective one dose oral treatments, these are not known to be safe or effective in pregnancy. The above trials do show that imidazoles are effective though it seems that longer courses of treatment may be needed in pregnancy (one week) to achieve symptom relief. Though <LINK REF="STD-Ruiz_x002d_Velasco-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Ruiz-Velasco 1978</LINK> looked for the presence of candida on neonatal skin, the importance of such skin contamination is completely unknown. Vaginal thrush in pregnancy is not known to be harmful to the fetus.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2009-10-27 14:07:14 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jill V Hampson">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>Topical imidazoles and not nystatin, should be used if possible for symptomatic vaginal candidiasis in pregnancy. There is no evidence to suggest that asymptomatic women need to be treated. Treatment courses lasting more than one week confer no extra benefit. Four day courses will cure just over half of infections whereas a seven day course cures over 90%. Pregnant women should be offered longer courses of treatment than non-pregnant women. There is no evidence that any one imidazole is any more effective than another. There are no reliable studies on the safety or efficacy of any complimentary therapies for prevention or cure (e.g. live yoghurt). Such treatments cannot therefore be recommended.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2009-10-27 14:07:14 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jill V Hampson">
<P>Studies could be set up to explore whether neonatal contamination with candida is of any clinical importance. Longer acting formulations could be tried to improve compliance. As topical treatment is very rarely ineffective, research into the relative safety of any systemic treatment would appear to be of limited value.</P>

<P>Black pregnant women attending a hospital antenatal clinic in South Africa. All women were culture positive at the start but it is not stated that they were necessarily symptomatic.</P>
</CHAR_PARTICIPANTS>
<CHAR_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>All women used econazole vaginal cream one applicator full at night for 7 days. Women still positive for candida were then either given no treatment or a further 7 days of the cream. Comparison is therefore between 7 days and 14 days of the same treatment.</P>
</CHAR_INTERVENTIONS>
<CHAR_OUTCOMES>
<P>Diminution of symptoms was 'considered a cure'.<BR/>
</P>
</CHAR_OUTCOMES>
<CHAR_NOTES>
<P>Trial entry was by being culture positive for monilia. Cure however was assessed by symptom relief. Treatment in the second week was compared with discontinuation of treatment. A placebo effect might be expected but the results show 2 weeks treatment to be worse than 1 week. This appears inexplicable.</P>
