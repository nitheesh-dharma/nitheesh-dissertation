<P>Cystoid macular oedema (CMO) is the accumulation of fluid in the macula (central retina) due to leakage from capillaries. Clinically significant CMO following cataract surgery is a complication of unknown cause. Acute CMO, defined as oedema of less than four months duration, often gets better spontaneously. This review included seven randomised controlled trials with a total of 266 participants. Four trials studied the effects of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents (NSAIDs) in chronic CMO while the other three examined the effect of NSAIDs in acute CMO. This review found two trials which showed that topical NSAID (0.5% ketorolac tromethamine ophthalmic solution) has a positive effect on chronic CMO and a third trial which was supportive of this finding (albeit not statistically significantly so). One study suggested no effect and our review suggests further work is needed for a more conclusive decision regarding use of NSAIDS in chronic CMO. Similarly, the effects of NSAIDs in acute CMO remain unclear and this too needs further investigation.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Cystoid macular oedema (CMO) is the accumulation of fluid in the central retina (the macula) due to leakage from dilated capillaries. It is the most common cause of poor visual outcome following cataract surgery. The exact cause is unclear. Acute CMO, defined as oedema of less than four months duration, often resolve spontaneously. CMO that persists for four months or more is termed chronic CMO. Different types of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents (NSAIDs) are used in the treatment of CMO which may be delivered topically or systemically.</P>

<P>We searched CENTRAL (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Group Trials Register) (<I>The Cochrane Library</I> 2011, Issue 7), MEDLINE (January 1950 to August 2011), EMBASE (January 1980 to August 2011), Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature Database (LILACS) (January 1982 to August 2011), the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (mRCT) (<A HREF="http://www.controlled-trials.com/">www.controlled-trials.com</A>) (August 2011) and ClinicalTrials.gov (<A HREF="http://www.clinicaltrials.gov">www.clinicaltrials.gov</A>) (August 2011). We searched the reference lists of identified trials. We searched conference abstracts (sessions related to cataract) in The Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology (ARVO) 1975 to 2011. We contacted experts in the field and NSAIDs manufacturers for details on published and unpublished trials.There were no language or date restrictions in the search for trials.

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2011-11-30 13:32:25 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Seven trials involving a total of 266 participants were included. Four trials studied the effects of NSAIDs in chronic CMO while the other three examined the effect of NSAIDs in acute CMO. Of the studies examining chronic CMO, one study enrolled 120 participants, but the remainder had 34 or fewer participants. Four different NSAIDs were used and administered in different ways. Indomethacin was used orally and was found to be ineffective for chronic CMO in one trial. Topical fenoprofen appeared effective but not statistically significantly so for chronic CMO in another small trial. Treatment with topical 0.5% ketorolac for chronic CMO was found to be effective in two trials. Three trials examined the effect of topical NSAIDs on acute CMO. The comparisons among these studies were of an NSAID to placebo, prednisolone or another NSAID. The study design differed between the studies in other important aspects thus they could not be combined in a meta-analysis.</P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2012-01-10 12:23:11 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2011-11-23 12:55:09 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Cystoid macular oedema (CMO) is the accumulation of extracellular fluid between the layers of the neurosensory retina and retinal pigment epithelium in the central retina (the macula) due to leakage from dilated capillaries. Cystoid macular oedema following cataract surgery was first reported in 1953 (<LINK REF="REF-Irvine-1953" TYPE="REFERENCE">Irvine 1953</LINK>). Since then techniques of cataract surgery have become much more sophisticated yet CMO is still recognised as one of the most common causes of poor visual outcome in patients following cataract surgery with or without intraocular lens implantation (<LINK REF="REF-Drolsum-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Drolsum 1995</LINK>).</P>
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2011-11-21 13:18:45 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>Cystoid macular oedema can be classified into two types. Angiographic CMO is diagnosed on fundus fluorescein angiography (FFA) and may not be associated with visual impairment. It has been reported to occur in 3% to 70% of people at four to 16 weeks after cataract surgery. Clinical CMO is characterised by reduced visual acuity accompanied by ophthalmoscopic and angiographic findings and this accounts for 0.1% to 12 % of cases (<LINK REF="REF-Rossetti-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rossetti 2000</LINK>). This wide variation in the reported incidence of CMO is due mainly to the different surgical techniques and methods used for diagnosis, although there are thought to be many other so far unidentified risk factors (<LINK REF="STD-Flach-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Flach 1998</LINK>).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Presentation and diagnosis</HEADING>
<P>Cystoid macular oedema may be asymptomatic but may present with decreased and/or distorted vision. Slit-lamp biomicroscopy may not show any abnormalities in 5% to 10% of eyes (<LINK REF="REF-Desai-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Desai 1993</LINK>). In others, the findings may vary from an altered foveal reflex to a honeycomb appearance at the macula. Many patients have co-existent inflammatory signs. Fundus fluorescein angiography is the diagnostic procedure of choice in case of doubtful clinical CMO. Findings may vary from a mild leakage to a full-fledged flower petal appearance at the macula. The macular findings are associated with leakage from the optic disc. Visual function does not correlate well with the severity of clinical or angiographic changes (<LINK REF="REF-Spaide-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spaide 1993</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2011-05-09 18:59:42 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>The exact cause of CMO remains unclear. <LINK REF="REF-Irvine-1953" TYPE="REFERENCE">Irvine 1953</LINK> attributed it to the incarceration of vitreous in the anterior segment and consequent vitreo-macular traction. This has led investigators to manage CMO with pars plana vitrectomy or neodymium yttrium-aluminum-garnet (YAG) vitreolysis. The use of acetazolamide and hyperbaric oxygen are based on the theory that CMO may be the result of disruption of the blood-retinal barrier.</P>
<P>Most investigators agree that inflammation is the major aetiological factor. The pharmacologic agents used to combat the inflammation and CMO are topical and periocular corticosteroids and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Topical NSAIDs have been used since the 1970s both pre- and postoperatively to prevent and treat CMO following cataract surgery.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2011-11-23 12:55:09 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>One of the postulations for pseudophakic CMO is inflammation with adjunct increased synthesis of prostaglandins. </P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2011-11-21 13:48:23 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>A systematic review on the medical prophylaxis and treatment of CMO after cataract surgery was published in 1998 (<LINK REF="REF-Rossetti-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rossetti 1998</LINK>). The review concluded that when numerous small studies are combined, there was an indication of an effect of NSAIDs both in the prevention and treatment of CMO. However, no conclusion could be safely drawn since the authors commented that many of the trials were of poor quality and may additionally be regarded as too heterogeneous to include in one meta-analysis. Therefore, uncertainty of the effectiveness of NSAIDs in the treatment of CMO persists. A Cochrane review is needed to address this question alone and to update what is currently known using rigorous quality control and conducting meta-analysis only when sufficient homogeneity of studies allows. A separate Cochrane review on NSAID prophylaxis for post-cataract surgery CMO is underway (<LINK REF="REF-Abeysiri-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Abeysiri 2011</LINK>).</P>

<DATA_SYNTHESIS MODIFIED="2012-01-10 12:09:44 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>We were unable to conduct any meta-analyses on acute CMO because of the clinical heterogeneity observed between studies. Different interventions, time points for outcome measures etc. meant that although a forest plot was presented for the effectiveness of NSAID on chronic CMO at the end of treatment and at one month after cessation of treatment, summary effects were not estimated. The two Flach studies (<LINK REF="STD-Flach-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Flach 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Flach-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Flach 1991</LINK>) could perhaps be combined but this would add little to the overall conclusions of the review.</P>
<P>If additional trials become available in future we will analyse them as follows. We will calculate relative risks for dichotomous outcomes. If appropriate, we will combine data in a meta-analysis using the random-effects model. If there are fewer than three studies and results appear homogeneous, we will use a fixed-effect model. We will not rely on statistical significance of a Chi<SUP>2 </SUP>test to indicate heterogeneity but will examine the forest plot of the study results and the overall characteristics of the studies. We will also examine the I<SUP>2</SUP> value and its confidence interval.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2012-01-09 13:10:09 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>This review of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for the treatment of cystoid macular oedema (CMO) following cataract surgery classified CMO into acute CMO (duration of CMO of less than four months) and chronic CMO (more than four months).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Acute CMO</HEADING>
<P>All three randomised controlled trials assessing the effect of NSAIDs in the treatment of acute CMO were small (<LINK REF="STD-Flach-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Flach 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Heier-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Heier 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rho-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Rho 2003</LINK>) and insufficiently powered to detect anything but major effects. Spontaneous resolution and drug effect in acute CMO are hard to distinguish in these studies. Outcomes at seven years in <LINK REF="STD-Flach-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Flach 1998</LINK> suggest the natural history of CMO is spontaneous resolution. <LINK REF="STD-Flach-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Flach 1998</LINK> showed no benefit of NSAIDs alone in the treatment of acute CMO. However, <LINK REF="STD-Heier-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Heier 2000</LINK> found that the combination of topical prednisolone and ketorolac to be synergistic and beneficial. <LINK REF="STD-Rho-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Rho 2003</LINK> noted significant reduction in CMO and improvement of visual acuity with either topical ketorolac or diclofenac sodium.</P>
<P>While <LINK REF="STD-Heier-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Heier 2000</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Rho-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Rho 2003</LINK> showed a statistically significant positive response of acute CMO with combined treatment of ketorolac and steroids, <LINK REF="STD-Flach-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Flach 1998</LINK> did not show a significant effect of ketorolac alone in acute CMO. This difference in effect can be explained by the following facts:</P>
<P>1. All three trials used 0.5% topical ketorolac tromethamine as the NSAID. <LINK REF="STD-Flach-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Flach 1998</LINK> compared the effect of ketorolac with placebo while <LINK REF="STD-Heier-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Heier 2000</LINK> compared ketorolac alone with prednisolone alone and a combination of ketorolac and prednisolone and <LINK REF="STD-Rho-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Rho 2003</LINK> compared ketorolac to diclofenac sodium. <LINK REF="STD-Heier-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Heier 2000</LINK> treated participants for three months while <LINK REF="STD-Flach-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Flach 1998</LINK> did a cross-over study of one month of ketorolac and one month of placebo. <LINK REF="STD-Rho-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Rho 2003</LINK> treated participants for 26 weeks.<BR/>2. The duration of CMO was less than 45 days in <LINK REF="STD-Rho-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Rho 2003</LINK>, 45 to 49 days in <LINK REF="STD-Heier-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Heier 2000</LINK> and 60 to 90 days in <LINK REF="STD-Flach-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Flach 1998</LINK>.<BR/>3. The cataract surgery was different in the three trials. The participants in <LINK REF="STD-Heier-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Heier 2000</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Rho-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Rho 2003</LINK> underwent uncomplicated phacoemulsification and intraocular lens implantation while <LINK REF="STD-Flach-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Flach 1998</LINK> used extracapsular cataract surgery and intraocular lens implantation including complicated cases.<BR/>4. In <LINK REF="STD-Heier-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Heier 2000</LINK>, 50% of the participants in the ketorolac group were already on topical steroids at the time of enrolment, so some of the positive effect noted in this study might be attributed to the combination of NSAIDs and steroids.</P>
<P>We could not conduct a meta-analysis because of the heterogeneity in study design. <LINK REF="STD-Heier-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Heier 2000</LINK> suggested that a combination of topical ketorolac and steroids is beneficial in acute CMO while <LINK REF="STD-Rho-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Rho 2003</LINK> concluded that both ketorolac and diclofenac sodium are equally effective in reducing CMO and improving visual acuity.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Chronic CMO</HEADING>
<P>The four trials on NSAIDs for chronic CMO showed a broad range of therapeutic effects (<LINK REF="STD-Burnett-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Burnett 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Flach-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Flach 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Flach-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Flach 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yannuzzi-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Yannuzzi 1977</LINK>). One trial showed a negative but not statistically significant effect of NSAIDs in chronic CMO (<LINK REF="STD-Yannuzzi-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Yannuzzi 1977</LINK>). It used an oral NSAID which raises doubts about the role of oral NSAIDs in ocular disease; one study found a positive but not significant effect (<LINK REF="STD-Burnett-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Burnett 1983</LINK>) and the other two studies found a statistically significant benefit (<LINK REF="STD-Flach-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Flach 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Flach-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Flach 1991</LINK>).</P>
<P>The two older studies with negative results included only aphakic eyes (intracapsular cataract surgery) while the newer studies included both aphakic and pseudophakic eyes (intracapsular and extracapsular cataract surgery with intraocular lens implantation). The different surgical techniques and associated inflammation and the light transmission characteristics of the various intraocular lenses may be important variables that affected the results. The variability in results can also be explained by the fact that different NSAIDs were used in the various trials. Oral indomethacin was found to be ineffective in the treatment of clinical chronic CMO (<LINK REF="STD-Yannuzzi-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Yannuzzi 1977</LINK>). Topical fenoprofen was not shown to be effective (<LINK REF="STD-Burnett-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Burnett 1983</LINK>). The only NSAID found to be effective is topical 0.5% ketorolac tromethamine (<LINK REF="STD-Flach-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Flach 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Flach-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Flach 1991</LINK>).</P>
<P>Another factor is the small sample size in three of the four studies (<LINK REF="STD-Burnett-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Burnett 1983</LINK> -14 participants, <LINK REF="STD-Flach-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Flach 1987</LINK> - 26 and <LINK REF="STD-Yannuzzi-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Yannuzzi 1977</LINK> - 23). These sample sizes are too small to allow subgroup analysis of the duration of decreased visual acuity and the resultant structural changes at the macula that can influence the initial vision, response to treatment and final outcome.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Comparison of duration of treatment</HEADING>
<P>Duration of treatment differed between the two trials which showed some benefit of NSAIDs (topical ketorolac) for chronic CMO. The treatment lasted for two months in <LINK REF="STD-Flach-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Flach 1987</LINK> and for three months in <LINK REF="STD-Flach-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Flach 1991</LINK>. Three months duration showed better therapeutic response but the study samples were different (30 versus 120 participants respectively).</P>
<P>All studies used angiographic evidence as one of the criteria to confirm clinically significant CMO. Angiographic response to treatment was also an outcome measure in two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Burnett-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Burnett 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Flach-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Flach 1987</LINK>). Improvement in vision did not correlate with angiographic changes, so angiography is of doubtful value as an outcome in future studies.</P>

<P>For acute cystoid macular oedema (CMO), the evidence is insufficient to clearly inform practice. Three small studies which could not be combined indicated that there may be therapeutic benefit especially when used in combination with topical steroids.</P>
<P>In chronic disease, the findings of the two trials by Flach suggest topical NSAID (0.5% ketorolac tromethamine) is effective and that duration of treatment for three months provides a more persistent benefit than two months. One trial reported a negative effect and because the trials are small, we still recommend further work in this area for a conclusive result.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2012-01-09 13:10:11 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>More research is needed to better understand the cause of this condition and its patho-physiology. Risk factors require elucidation so that those at risk can be identified.</P>
<P>The therapeutic effect of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents (NSAIDs) on acute CMO needs to be assessed by larger trials with longer follow up. Further studies are needed to compare various available topical NSAIDs to find the most effective NSAID in the treatment of chronic clinical CMO following cataract surgery. In addition, the optimum duration of treatment cannot be determined at present as the existing trials used different time scales.</P>
<P>The most relevant and pragmatic outcome measure is probably best corrected visual acuity of the affected eye at different time points after initiation of treatment. Contrast sensitivity may be of value but was only looked at in one of the included trials. Measures of retinal thickness using the optical coherence tomography (OCT) may also be of use though the extent to which this correlates with function has so far not been described in randomised controlled trials. Fluorescein angiography may be of value in confirming diagnosis but OCT is probably safer and simpler. As an outcome measure to assess therapeutic response, it is not likely to be justified. Other aspects of visual function and vision related quality of life should be considered.</P>
<P>Given that CMO, though not that common a complication of cataract surgery, affects many thousands of people since cataract surgery is one of the most frequently performed surgical procedures, it is astonishing that there is so little good quality research to answer questions about its treatment. There is clearly an urgent need for this gap in the evidence base to be filled.</P>
