<P>
<B>Review question</B>
</P>
<P>To assess the effect of withholding gonadotrophins (coasting) to prevent ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome in assisted reproduction cycles.</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) is a complication of using hormones to induce ovulation (the release of eggs) in IVF (in vitro fertilization). The hormones can sometimes over stimulate the ovaries. Severe OHSS can be life threatening. One method used to try and reduce the risk of OHSS is 'coasting' or 'prolonged coasting'. This involves withholding one hormone (gonadotrophin) before ovulation.</P>
<P>
<B>Search Date</B>
</P>
<P>We included studies up to 6th of July 2016.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>Eight randomised controlled trials (702 women) were identified that compared withholding gonadotrophins (coasting) with another intervention to prevent ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome. The other interventions included no coasting, early unilateral follicular aspiration (taking follicles from one ovary 10 to 12 hours after the administration of human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG)), gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonist (drugs that block the release of luteinising hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and FSH co-trigger (extra dose of FSH given at the same time as the hCG).</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>There was low-quality evidence to suggest that coasting reduced rates of moderate or severe OHSS more than no coasting. There was no evidence to suggest that coasting was more beneficial than other interventions, except that there was very low-quality evidence from a single small study to suggest that using FSH co-trigger at the time of HCG administration may be better at reducing the risk of OHSS than coasting. There were too few data to determine clearly whether there was a difference between the groups for any other outcomes.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
</P>
<P>The quality of evidence was low or very low. The main limitations were failure to report live birth, risk of bias due to lack of information about study methods, and imprecision due to low event rates and lack of data. Four of the studies were published only as abstracts, and provided limited data.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2017-05-15 08:20:21 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) is an iatrogenic and potentially life threatening condition resulting from excessive ovarian stimulation. Reported incidence of moderate to severe OHSS ranges from 0.6% to 5% of in vitro fertilization (IVF) cycles. The factors contributing to OHSS have not been completely explained. The release of vasoactive substances secreted by the ovaries under human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) stimulation may play a key role in triggering this syndrome. This condition is characterised by a massive shift of fluid from the intravascular compartment to the third space, resulting in profound intravascular depletion and haemoconcentration.</P>

<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2017-05-15 10:29:03 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two review authors independently selected trials and extracted data. They resolved disagreements by discussion. They contacted study authors to request additional information or missing data. The intervention comparisons were coasting versus no coasting, coasting versus early unilateral follicular aspiration (EUFA), coasting versus gonadotrophin releasing hormone antagonist (antagonist), coasting versus follicle stimulating hormone administration at the time of hCG trigger (FSH co-trigger), and coasting versus cabergoline. We performed statistical analysis in accordance with Cochrane guidelines. Our primary outcomes were moderate or severe OHSS and live birth.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-05-18 12:52:27 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included eight RCTs (702 women at high risk of developing OHSS). The quality of evidence was low or very low. The main limitations were failure to report live birth, risk of bias due to lack of information about study methods, and imprecision due to low event rates and lack of data. Four of the studies were published only as abstracts, and provided limited data.</P>
<P>
<B>Coasting versus no coasting</B>
</P>
<P>Rates of OHSS were lower in the coasting group (OR 0.11, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.24; I = 0%, two RCTs; 207 women; low-quality evidence), suggesting that if 45% of women developed moderate or severe OHSS without coasting, between 4% and 17% of women would develop it with coasting. There were too few data to determine whether there was a difference between the groups in rates of live birth (OR 0.48, 95% CI 0.14 to 1.62; one RCT; 68 women; very low-quality evidence), clinical pregnancy (OR 0.82, 95% CI 0.46 to 1.44; I = 0%; two RCTs; 207 women; low-quality evidence), multiple pregnancy (OR 0.31, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.81; one RCT; 139 women; low-quality evidence), or miscarriage (OR 0.85, 95% CI 0.25 to 2.86; I = 0%; two RCTs; 207 women; very low-quality evidence).</P>
<P>
<B>Coasting versus EUFA</B>
</P>
<P>There were too few data to determine whether there was a difference between the groups in rates of OHSS (OR 0.98, 95% CI 0.34 to 2.85; I = 0%; 2 RCTs; 83 women; very low-quality evidence), or clinical pregnancy (OR 0.67, 95% CI 0.25 to 1.79; I = 0%; 2 RCTs; 83 women; very low-quality evidence); no studies reported live birth, multiple pregnancy, or miscarriage.</P>
<P>
<B>Coasting versus antagonist</B>
</P>
<P>One RCT (190 women) reported this comparison, and no events of OHSS occurred in either arm. There were too few data to determine whether there was a difference between the groups in clinical pregnancy rates (OR 0.74, 95% CI 0.42 to 1.31; one RCT; 190 women; low-quality evidence), or multiple pregnancy rates (OR 1.00, 95% CI 0.43 to 2.32; one RCT; 98 women; very low-quality evidence); the study did not report live birth or miscarriage.</P>
<P>
<B>Coasting versus FSH co-trigger</B>
</P>
<P>Rates of OHSS were higher in the coasting group (OR 43.74, 95% CI 2.54 to 754.58; one RCT; 102 women; very low-quality evidence), with 15 events in the coasting arm and none in the FSH co-trigger arm. There were too few data to determine whether there was a difference between the groups in clinical pregnancy rates (OR 0.92, 95% CI 0.43 to 2.10; one RCT; 102 women; low-quality evidence). This study did not report data suitable for analysis on live birth, multiple pregnancy, or miscarriage, but stated that there was no significant difference between the groups.</P>
<P>
<B>Coasting versus cabergoline</B>
</P>
<P>There were too few data to determine whether there was a difference between the groups in rates of OHSS (OR 1.98, 95% CI 0.09 to 5.68; P = 0.20; I = 72%; two RCTs; 120 women; very low-quality evidence), with 11 events in the coasting arm and six in the cabergoline arm. The evidence suggested that coasting was associated with lower rates of clinical pregnancy (OR 0.38, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.88; P = 0.02; I =0%; two RCTs; 120 women; very low-quality evidence), but there were only 33 events altogether. These studies did not report data suitable for analysis on live birth, multiple pregnancy, or miscarriage.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2017-05-22 14:41:06 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="Helen E Nagels">
<P>Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) is an iatrogenic, potentially life threatening condition resulting from excessive ovarian stimulation. The American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM) noted that the incidence of OHSS is difficult to determine, as there is no consensus definition. Estimates of the incidence of moderate to severe OHSS range from 0.6% to 5% of assisted reproduction cycles (<LINK REF="REF-ASRM-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">ASRM 2016</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Calhaz_x002d_Jorge-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Calhaz-Jorge 2016</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kawwass-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kawwass 2015</LINK>). Studies of risk factors for OHSS have identified younger age, black race, ovulation, tubal factor, unexplained infertility, younger age, and possibly a lower body mass index (<LINK REF="REF-ASRM-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">ASRM 2016</LINK>).</P>
<P>In addition, polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) or an ultrasonographic ovarian appearance of polycystic ovaries (presence of multiple, small follicles at the periphery of the ovary with echogenic stroma); establishment of pregnancy during assisted reproduction treatment (ART); human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) supplementation of the luteal phase; and high serum estradiol (E2; higher than 2500 pg/ml) were reported to be associated with OHSS.</P>
<P>Rabau and colleagues originally classified OHSS as mild, moderate or severe (<LINK REF="REF-Rabau-1967" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rabau 1967</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schenker-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schenker 1978</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-Golan-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Golan 1989</LINK> subsequently modified it by incorporating ultrasonographic measurement of the stimulated ovaries (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-Navot-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Navot 1992</LINK> introduced further modification by differentiating between the severe and the life threatening form of OHSS (<LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>). There was further classification from <LINK REF="REF-Rizk-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rizk 1999</LINK> (<LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK>).</P>
<P>The factors leading to this syndrome have not been completely elucidated. It seems likely that the release of vasoactive substances, for example vascular endothelium growth factor (VEGF) secreted by the ovaries under hCG stimulation, play a key role in triggering this syndrome (<LINK REF="REF-Goldsman-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goldsman 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tsirigotis-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tsirigotis 1994</LINK>). As more follicles are recruited in response to gonadotrophin stimulation, the mass of the granulosa cells increases, while at the same time, the cells gain functional maturation. These two factors, acting synergistically, cause a concomitant increase in serum estradiol levels and vasoactive substances (as yet poorly defined (<LINK REF="REF-Agrawal-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Agrawal 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Al_x002d_Shawaf-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Al-Shawaf 2001</LINK>)). This condition is characterised by a massive shift of fluid from the intra-vascular compartment to the third space, resulting in profound intra-vascular depletion and haemoconcentration (<LINK REF="REF-Rabau-1967" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rabau 1967</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schenker-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schenker 1978</LINK>).</P>
<P>Alternative strategies (embryo freezing, antagonist cycles, intravenous albumin infusion, agonist trigger, cabergoline) have been proposed for women undergoing ART who are at high risk of OHSS. Each of these strategies may reduce, but not eliminate, the risk.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2017-05-12 02:57:50 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Coasting, or prolonged coasting, may be defined as a process whereby: (1) gonadotrophin therapy is discontinued while administration of gonadotrophin-releasing hormone agonist (GnRHa) is continued; (2) there is a delay, by a variable number of days, in administering hCG injection to trigger oocyte maturation prior to oocyte retrieval, until safe estradiol levels are attained (<LINK REF="REF-Sher-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sher 1993</LINK>). Coasting should not be initiated too early, or too late. The effective duration of coasting is still to be determined. Many authors believe that each IVF centre should identify its own cut-off limit of serum estradiol, follicle size, or both, at the onset of coasting, and hCG administration (<LINK REF="STD-Al_x002d_Shawaf-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Al-Shawaf 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Waldenstrom-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Waldenstrom 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="TBL-04" TYPE="TABLE">Table 4</LINK>).</P>
<P>It has also been postulated that follicles of varying size have a different threshold to gonadotrophins, and smaller follicles appear to be more susceptible to gonadotrophin deprivation than larger follicles (<LINK REF="STD-Fluker-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Fluker 1999</LINK>). When coasting is initiated prior to 30% of follicles having attained a mean diameter of 15 mm, an abrupt arrest in follicular development and a rapid decline in plasma estradiol usually compromise the oocyte quality. But the quality of the oocytes is also compromised, and large cystic follicles are commonly encountered, if most of the follicles are larger than 15 mm in mean diameter when coasting is implemented (<LINK REF="STD-Sher-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Sher 1995</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2017-05-12 03:01:41 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>It was suggested that this approach prevents severe OHSS by removing the follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) stimulation of granulosa cells, thereby inhibiting their proliferation and reducing the number of granulosa cells available for luteinization (<LINK REF="STD-Sher-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Sher 1995</LINK>). This would allow continued follicular growth and maturation, while reducing the risk of OHSS (<LINK REF="STD-Fluker-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Fluker 1999</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Tortoriello-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Tortoriello 1998</LINK> also suggested that the falling FSH concentration induces an increased apoptosis of granulosa cells, which results in a reduction of chemical mediators or precursors that augment fluid extravasation.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2017-05-12 03:03:34 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome is a potentially life threatening condition associated with super-ovulation in ART. Coasting is a widespread practise, for which evidence is currently lacking. Therefore, it is important to establish, from the scientific literature, whether coasting can reduce the incidence of this condition.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-05-18 13:09:59 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There was low-quality evidence to suggest that coasting reduced moderate or severe OHSS more than no coasting. There was very low-quality evidence suggesting that using FSH co-trigger prevented moderate and severe OHSS better than coasting, but the evidence was derived from only one small trial. There was no clear evidence of any difference in the rate of moderate or severe OHSS or in the achievement of clinical pregnancy when coasting was compared with early unilateral follicular aspiration (very low-quality evidence), GnRH antagonist (low or very low quality evidence), or cabergoline (low or very low-quality evidence). Nor was there evidence to suggest a benefit in live birth from coasting compared with no coasting, although the data were from a single trial only. It was difficult to draw any conclusions about the number of oocytes obtained due to the statistical heterogeneity of the studies. Nor was there any clear evidence of differences between the groups in clinical pregnancy, multiple pregnancies, live births or miscarriage rates.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2017-05-18 13:15:32 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Only eight randomised trials were identified, and four of these were conference abstracts that never became full publications. The completeness and applicability of the data were substantially limited by this factor. Authors were contacted, but did not respond directly, and some missing data were obtained from another Cochrane review. Only one of the trials reported data suitable for analysis on the outcome of live birth. There may be additional interventions that have not been compared yet with coasting, in a randomised controlled trial.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2017-05-15 04:30:09 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The overall quality of the evidence was low or very low. The main limitations were failure to report live birth, risk of bias due to lack of information about study methods, and imprecision due to low event rates and lack of data. Four of the studies were published only as abstracts, with limited data and no evidence of full publication (<LINK REF="STD-Aflatoonian-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Aflatoonian 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dalal-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Dalal 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Egbase-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Egbase 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kamthane-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Kamthane 2007</LINK>). Three to four years is longer than expected to publish a full paper. With the exception of the number of oocytes retrieved, the statistical heterogeneity between studies was acceptable. The inclusion criteria and OHSS classification used varied between the studies.</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2017-05-15 04:31:39 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The authors attempted to identify all potential studies using a variety of methods. One of the main biases, as mentioned above, is that several of the trials were only published as conference abstracts. There may be other relevant data which were not reported. Therefore, the results of the review must be interpreted with caution.</P>
</POTENTIAL_BIASES>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2017-05-15 17:56:22 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="Helen E Nagels">
<P>In some excluded studies, the higher the oestrogen level at the beginning of coasting, the less effective the intervention was at preventing OHSS, regardless of the duration of the coasting period (see <LINK REF="STD-Aboulghar-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Aboulghar 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dhont-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Dhont 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fluker-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Fluker 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lee-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Lee 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sher-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Sher 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Waldenstrom-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Waldenstrom 1999</LINK>). The inclusion criterion for this review was oestrogen levels higher than 2500 pg/ml. The four included trials used a cut-off of 3000 pg/ml, and this may, in part, explain the lack of effect.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2017-05-18 12:54:20 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There was low-quality evidence to suggest a benefit to using coasting rather than no coasting, to reduce rates of moderate or severe OHSS. Evidence did not suggest that coasting was more beneficial than other interventions such as early unilateral follicular aspiration, gonadotrophin-releasing hormone antagonist or cabergoline. There was very low-quality evidence from a single small study to suggest that using FSH co-trigger at the time of HCG administration may be better at reducing the risk of OHSS than coasting. There were too few data to determine clearly whether there was a difference between the groups for any other outcomes. Therefore, at present, clinicians may wish to employ other strategies for preventing OHSS rather than just coasting, until further evidence has accumulated.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2017-04-19 12:11:52 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Given the current practice of "freeze all" and the use of antagonist protocols with agonist trigger, further research into coasting may not be relevant.</P>

<P>The number of embryos transferred was removed as an outcome in the 2010 update. It was not a measure of the treatment effect as the number of embryos transferred is subject to external regulation.</P>
<P>The number of patients admitted to hospital was removed as an outcome in the 2017 update, as this is not a measure of the treatment effect, since management protocols for OHSS may vary in different centres. The number of days to next menstrual period was removed as an outcome in the 2017 update, as this is not a measure of the severity of OHSS. The miscarriage rate was added as an outcome in 2017, as it is a relevant clinical outcome. Multiple pregnancy rate and miscarriage rate were analyzed both per woman randomised and per pregnancy in this update, to explore whether our findings were sensitive to the choice of analysis.</P>
<P>We amended the inclusion criteria for participants, as it was previously unclear whether only women with PCOS were eligible: we have clarified that women with PCOS are eligible, but the review was not restricted to women with PCOS</P>
