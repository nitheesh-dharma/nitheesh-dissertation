<TITLE MODIFIED="2008-10-30 16:20:13 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">A comparison of the healthy donor's experience of donating their blood stem cells to a patient who is to receive a stem cell transplant as treatment for cancer of their blood (e.g. leukaemia)</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2008-10-30 16:56:17 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Blood stem cells are collected from a donor in two ways: either through a bone marrow harvest (direct retrieval of the stem cells from the donor's hip bones, under general anaesthetic) or a peripheral blood stem cell collection (retrieval of stem cells using a blood cell separator machine, following a course of granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) injections). Both these methods of donation are common. Much research has explored which method of donation gives the best outcome to the patient, however there has not been a lot of research exploring these methods of donation from the donor's perspective. Such research is important if there is the possibility of long-term adverse events for the donor. For example, the long-term adverse events of G-CSF are not known, but there is the suggestion of a correlation between G-CSF and development of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). However, in many instances, donors are given a choice as to which method they would like to use to donate their stem cells. The aim of this review was to compare directly these two methods of blood stem cell donation from the donor's perspective, to understand the experiences of the donor. In this review, each donor was a sibling of the patient to whom they were donating blood stem cells.</P>
<P>Six trials (807 donors) were identified for this review. The review found that donors donating via a bone marrow harvest experienced more pain at the donation site (hip bone area) in the days following the donation, more days of restricted activity (e.g. sick days), more days in hospital and more side effects than donors donating through a peripheral blood stem cell harvest. In contrast, peripheral blood stem cell harvest donors experienced more pain prior to the donation of blood stem cells than bone marrow harvest donors. This pain was as a result of G-CSF administration. All donors had increased levels of tiredness and reduced levels of energy and anxiety following their donation.</P>
<P>There were three main limitations of this review. Firstly, in two trials more than 40% of the donors did not complete the trial. Secondly, there was no long-term follow up of the donors in any trial. Thirdly, the trials used different questionnaires to record the donors emotional experience of the donation procedure which made it difficult to compare the results of these measurements across the six trials. Further research, with larger numbers of included donors, would provide a greater understanding of the donation experience.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2008-10-30 16:56:17 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Six trials (807 donors) were eligible: all were substudies, or constituent parts of, larger randomised controlled trials of bone marrow and peripheral blood stem cell allogeneic transplantation. No included trial was designed solely to measure and assess the experience of stem cell donors. The donors in all studies were related to the stem cell recipient. Overall, both types of donors experienced pain subsequent to donation, and psychological morbidity. The trend was for bone marrow donors to experience more pain at the donation site, more overall adverse events, and more days of restricted activity. They were also more likely to require hospitalisation than peripheral blood stem cell donors. In contrast, peripheral blood stem cell donors experienced more pain prior to donation, which may be related to the pre-donation administration of granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF). The methodological quality of the studies was poor and indicated limitations due to the risk of selection and attrition bias. The proportion of donors from the parent trial not included in the donor substudies was also inadequately explained.</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2008-10-30 16:56:17 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The different short-term morbidities associated with each type of haemopoietic stem cell donation were clear, with bone marrow donors experiencing more pain and more restriction post-donation than peripheral blood donors. However, the studies were limited by their methodological quality, failure to provide long-term follow up (for which larger numbers of donors would be required) and a failure to apply consistent measures of quality of life in a way which allows more meaningful evaluation across studies.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-10-30 16:56:17 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Patients with haematological malignancies such as leukaemia, lymphoma and myeloma are often treated with a haemopoietic stem cell transplant (SCT), from either allogeneic or autologous stem cells. The aim of the transplant is to control their disease and possibly cure them. In allogeneic stem cell transplantation, this potentially life saving treatment can only be carried out if haemopoietic stem cells (the cells from which all types of blood cells are derived) are donated by a healthy volunteer (related or unrelated).</P>
<P>Haemopoietic stem cells can be collected from the donor in two ways: a bone marrow harvest (BM) or by peripheral blood (PB) stem cell collection. A bone marrow harvest is performed under general anaesthetic (<LINK REF="STD-Favre-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Favre 2003</LINK>). Haemopoietic stem cells are directly aspirated from both the hip bones (posterior superior iliac crests) under general anaesthesia (<LINK REF="REF-Buckner-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Buckner 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Favre-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Favre 2003</LINK>). The donor may need to stay in hospital overnight. The main sequelae are pain and bruising at the site of aspiration, anaemia and the risks of a general anaesthetic (<LINK REF="REF-Nishimori-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nishimori 2002</LINK>). The donor may require pain killers for a short time following the procedure and some time off work.</P>
<P>Peripheral blood stem cell collection involves administering subcutaneous injections of granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) to the donor for approximately five days. These injections are given once daily and cause the stem cells from the bone marrow to 'mobilise' into the blood stream. The donor is then connected to a blood cell separator machine which collects the bone marrow stem cells and returns all other blood cells back to the donor. The donor can be on the machine for three to five hours for one to three days. Side effects can be divided into those related to the procedure, which are predominantly transient, and those related to the administration of G-CSF. Procedural effects include low blood pressure (hypotension) and a fall in calcium levels (hypocalcaemia) as well as bruising at the sites of venepuncture. G-CSF can cause moderate bone pain due to the mobilisation of stem cells into the circulation (<LINK REF="STD-Favre-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Favre 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Switzer-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Switzer 2002</LINK>). Although this is an outpatient procedure, the donor spends a significant amount of time connected to the cell separator.</P>
<P>These documented side effects are generally thought to be minor and acceptable to donors, given the potential benefit to the recipient (<LINK REF="REF-Switzer-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Switzer 2002</LINK>). However, more significant side effects have been reported with both procedures. Bone marrow harvests have caused mechanical back pain (<LINK REF="REF-Switzer-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Switzer 2002</LINK>), pelvic fractures and sepsis (<LINK REF="REF-Buckner-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Buckner 1984</LINK>). Splenic rupture following G-CSF administration has been reported in five allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell donors (<LINK REF="REF-Balaguer-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Balaguer 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Brown-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brown 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Dincer-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dincer 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Falzetti-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Falzetti 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nuamah-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nuamah 2006</LINK>). It has also been reported in six patients receiving G-CSF for a haematological malignancy (<LINK REF="REF-Arshad-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Arshad 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kasper-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kasper 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kuendgen-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kuendgen 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Malley-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Malley 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Veerappan-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Veerappan 2007</LINK>), small cell lung cancer (<LINK REF="REF-Watring-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Watring 2007</LINK>) and in three cases in the setting of stem cell transplantation (<LINK REF="REF-Kasper-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kasper 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kuendgen-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kuendgen 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Veerappan-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Veerappan 2007</LINK>). There is also a theoretical concern that G-CSF may induce a haematological malignancy such as acute myeloid leukaemia or a myelodysplastic syndrome (<LINK REF="REF-Bennett-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bennett 2006</LINK>). However the influence of G-CSF on future haematological events is not easy to determine, especially in related donors where there may be a genetic predisposition to leukaemia (<LINK REF="STD-Favre-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Favre 2003</LINK>). Moreover, there have been no proven cases to date.</P>
<P>A haemopoietic stem cell transplant may result in long-term survival and perhaps cure for the recipient, but the 'cost' to the donor also needs to be considered. Little is known about the long-term effects on the donor.There are approximately 12 million donors world wide (<LINK REF="REF-www.bmdw.org" TYPE="REFERENCE">www.bmdw.org</LINK>) and this number continues to increase. There is a duty of care to these healthy volunteers to ensure that their future health is not compromised.</P>
<P>Therefore, we have conducted a systematic review of the literature to address the issue of donor safety. The purpose of the review was two-fold. Firstly, to identify the side effects that can occur as a result of haemopoietic stem cell donation with both procedures. We aimed to assess both the physical and psychological effects, as well as the frequency and severity with which they occur. Secondly, based on that information, to determine which procedure is safer, i.e. associated with the least number of side effects and therefore more acceptable for the donor both in the short and long-term. This review will focus only on the donor and there will be no correlation with the recipient's outcome. The source of literature selected for this review was the randomised controlled trial (RCT). This type of trial provides the most robust form of data to compare interventions. Alternative, relevant sources of information could be considered later in subsequent reviews. For example haemopoietic stem cell donation in the UK is usually co-ordinated through one of the following organisations: The British Bone Marrow Registry (BBMR), The Welsh Bone Marrow Donor Registry (WBMDR) or The Anthony Nolan Trust (ANT). International searches are conducted through Bone Marrow Donors Worldwide (BMDW). However, these registries provide a different dataset for appraisal and it was felt that analysis of the relevant RCT literature would best provide an initial evaluation of the safety of the two methods of haemopoietic stem cell donation.</P>

<P>One author (CD) screened all titles and abstracts of papers identified by the review search strategy for relevancy to the review question. Only clearly irrelevant studies were excluded at this stage. We assessed all other studies for inclusion/exclusion on the basis of their full text using the criteria indicated above (<LINK TAG="CRIT_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Types of studies</LINK>, <LINK TAG="CRIT_PARTICIPANTS" TYPE="SECTION">Types of participants</LINK>, <LINK TAG="CRIT_INTERVENTIONS" TYPE="SECTION">Types of interventions</LINK> and <LINK TAG="CRIT_OUTCOMES" TYPE="SECTION">Types of outcome measures</LINK>). At this stage, two authors (SSiddiq, DP) independently assessed eligibility. Disagreements were resolved between the two authors. We recorded details of why studies were excluded.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Evaluation of methodological quality of included studies</HEADING>
<P>The following criteria formed the main evaluation of methodological quality (adapted from <LINK REF="REF-Juni-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Juni 2001</LINK>).</P>
<OL>
<LI>Generation of random sequence.</LI>
<LI>Concealment of treatment allocation schedule.</LI>
<LI>Blinding of clinician (person delivering treatment) to treatment allocation.</LI>
<LI>Blinding of participant to treatment allocation.</LI>
<LI>Blinding of outcome assessor to treatment allocation.</LI>
<LI>The proportion of randomised participants included in the main analysis, noting particularly where more than 20% were lost. Account was also taken of differing levels of loss to follow up affecting the validity of the results for different outcomes to different degrees.</LI>
<LI>Equal use of co-interventions in each trial arm.</LI>
</OL>
<P>We recorded problems in respect of these methodological issues in full.</P>
<P>We documented a narrative summary of these criteria by individual trial. In addition, we rated the criteria of generation of random sequence and concealment of treatment allocation schedule according to criteria identified in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2006</LINK>). This assigned ratings of A (adequate), B (unclear) or C (clearly inadequate) to each specified methodological criteria. We did not use evaluation of the methodological quality of each included trial in any formal statistical analysis within the review. Two authors undertook the assessment of methodological quality independently (SSiddiq, DP). We reported the findings of the methodological quality assessment and discussed the limitations of the methodological quality later in the review. We did not contact any authors requesting missing data for the evaluation of the methodological quality of the included studies.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Data extraction</HEADING>
<P>Aside from details relating to included trial quality, we extracted the following two groups of data.</P>
<OL>
<LI>Trial characteristics: place of publication, date of publication, population characteristics, setting, detailed nature of intervention, detailed nature of comparator, detailed nature of outcomes. A key purpose of these data was to explain clinical heterogeneity in included studies independently from analysis of results.</LI>
<LI>Results of included studies in respect of each of the main outcomes indicated in the review question. For dichotomous outcomes, the numbers of outcomes in treatment and control groups were recorded. For continuous outcomes, mean and standard deviation were recorded. Care was taken to record the number of donors included in each outcome analysis accurately as this number was found to vary within each trial.</LI>
</OL>
<P>Two authors undertook data extraction independently (SSiddiq, DP). We extracted data onto trial specific data extraction forms, which were created and piloted. We contacted three authors by e-mail requesting additional data on the mean scores and effect sizes for specific outcome measures (two trials) and the numbers lost to follow up (one trial). Two authors responded to our enquiries but were unable to provide the data we had requested. We ascertained missing data on the methodological quality and number of donors randomised within the included studies by extracting the data from the 'parent' studies of the included studies. We resolved disagreements by consensus between the authors and, once resolved, recorded the consensus data extracted onto a third data extraction form. One author (SB) transcribed this into the systematic review computer software RevMan 5 (<LINK REF="REF-Review-Manager-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Review Manager 2008</LINK>). Another author (SSiddiq) verified all data entry for discrepancies.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Analysis of data</HEADING>
<P>Extracted data were analysed using the most up-to-date version of RevMan available at the time of analysis (<LINK REF="REF-Review-Manager-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Review Manager 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>Where possible, we stated the overall findings in terms of the number of bone marrow (BM) or peripheral blood (PB) donors experiencing an outcome. We made the main interpretation from a balanced assessment of the pattern of results across the included studies. The intended method of analysis was quantitative. Where pooling of data was not possible, we discussed outcome findings by individual trial. The preferred form of summary result was a summary risk ratio (RR) for dichotomous outcomes, and weighted mean difference (WMD) for continuous data, both with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI).</P>
<P>However, quantitative meta-analysis was only possible for two outcomes: donor mortality and the number of donors returning to normal activity at seven days after donation. In both analyses, data was only available from two studies. No other meta-analysis was possible due to the different tools used to measure each outcome, the differing time-points for outcome assessment and the presentation of data as median in a number of included studies. Moreover, it was inappropriate to include three studies in any pooled analysis of outcome data. These three studies lacked sufficient details on the numbers of donors included in the main analysis and one trial failed to provide details of the number of donors randomised to the trial arms. The outcome data for these three studies have been discussed separately for each individual trial within the review (see below).</P>
<P>Given the lack of meta-analysis, we did not formally explore statistical heterogeneity in this review. We did not formally assess clinical heterogeneity, although it is clear from the '<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>' table and outcome data that there is wide clinical diversity between the included studies. We did not undertake any sensitivity analyses in this review as there was no difference in the rating of generation of random sequence between the included studies. Moreover, there was not enough similarity in the type of data reported for each outcome measure or the timing of the assessment of each outcome measure to enable any sensitivity analysis to be appropriate.</P>
<P>We had intended to examine the dose of G-CSF received and relation to symptom reporting in a subgroup analysis, however there was insufficient data from the included studies to make this analysis relevant. Finally, we had intended to assess publication bias using funnel plots. Again, there were an insufficient number of included studies to make such analysis meaningful.</P>

<P>Summary details are given in the '<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>' section.</P>
<P>Four hundred and ninety-five citations were identified from the searches. One hundred and twenty-eight from EMBASE, 95 from MEDLINE, 118 from the National Research Register, 56 from the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (clinical trials) and 62 from the National Blood Service register of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) . The remaining 36 were identified from a mix of www.ClinicalTrials.gov (17), the NHS Economic Evaluation Database (six), Zetoc (four), Cambridge Science Abstracts (four), CINAHL (two), ISI Web of Science (two) and the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE) (one). We identified no additional studies through contact with national bone marrow donor registries or through the reference lists of identified studies.</P>
<P>Initial screening of the citations and studies for relevance excluded 478 papers. The remaining 17 papers were assessed on the basis of their full text for inclusion or exclusion using the criteria indicated above (see <LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK>).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Studies excluded from the review</HEADING>
<P>Following full text eligibility assessment, 11 papers (representing 10 separate studies) were excluded from the review. See the '<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_EXCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of excluded studies</LINK>' table for further details. In summary, five did not randomise donors between donation of stem cells peripherally or from their bone marrow; three did not enrol the donors as their participant group; two randomised donors to different doses of G-CSF and in one trial donors donated both peripheral blood stem cells and bone marrow.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Studies included in the review</HEADING>
<P>Six trials were included in this review (see '<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>'). All studies were substudies, or constituent parts, of larger RCTs of bone marrow and peripheral blood stem cell allogeneic transplantation. No included trial was designed solely to measure the experience of stem cell donors. For the purposes of distinction between the two sets of studies within this review, larger studies looking at the outcomes of the recipient will be referred to as 'parent studies' and the studies upon which this review is based will be referred to as 'donor experience' studies. Full details of the parent studies are reported in <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>.</P>
<P>All included studies were parallel RCTs comparing donation by bone marrow (BM) with donation by peripheral blood stem cells (PB). Eight hundred and seven donors (range 59 to 329 donors) were included in the donor experience studies. These studies were undertaken between 1994 and 1999 and conducted in six countries: one each in Canada, France, Norway, Australia, USA and one as a multicentre Europe-wide trial. All studies were published as full journal articles and in English.</P>
<P>There were no significant differences in age (bone marrow range 16 to 63 years; peripheral blood range 14 to 66 years), or sex between the two groups of donors. All donors were either human leukocyte antigen (HLA) matched or one antigen mismatched with the recipient. All donors were related to the recipient (mostly siblings; two donors were parents (<LINK REF="STD-Heldal-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Heldal 2002</LINK>)). Fifteen (4%) donors required central venous access for apheresis. Although one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Favre-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Favre 2003</LINK>) excluded donors who had poor peripheral venous access, nine (2%) donors that were initially randomised to donate peripheral blood had to go on to have a bone marrow harvest due to an inadequate number of CD34 positive stem cells.</P>
<P>The dose of G-CSF administered varied from 10 mcg/kg body weight/day for four to five days (<LINK REF="STD-Favre-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Favre 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fortanier-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Fortanier 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Heldal-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Heldal 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kennedy-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Kennedy 2003</LINK>), 5 to 8 mcg/kg/day banded according to weight (<LINK REF="STD-Bredeson-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Bredeson 2004</LINK>) and 16 mcg/kg/day (<LINK REF="STD-Rowley-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Rowley 2001</LINK>). A mixture of lenograstim and filgrastim was used. All donors received the prescribed doses of G-CSF. No donor withdrew early because of side effects related to G-CSF.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Generation of the randomisation sequence</HEADING>
<P>No donor was randomised directly into the 'donor experience' trial. All randomisations were undertaken for the parent trial.</P>
<P>One donor experience trial (<LINK REF="STD-Kennedy-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Kennedy 2003</LINK>) reported the methods for the generation of randomisation sequence. This trial reported adequate methods for the generation of randomisation sequence and used "permuted blocks of 4 donors stratified according to risk of disease recurrence in the recipient".</P>
<P>The remaining five studies, although described as randomised controlled trials, were assessed to have unclear (B) methods of randomisation sequence generation. Information on the generation of randomisation sequence and concealment of treatment allocation was subsequently extracted from the parent trial for each of these five studies. This information is reported in <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>. Using the information from the parent trial, all five studies had adequate (A) methods of randomisation that were deemed sufficient to conceal treatment allocation from the investigator.</P>
<P>Three studies did not include all donors from the parent trial in the donor experience trial (<LINK REF="STD-Bredeson-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Bredeson 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fortanier-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Fortanier 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rowley-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Rowley 2001</LINK>). Only one of these (<LINK REF="STD-Bredeson-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Bredeson 2004</LINK>) reported the baseline characteristics of the donors in the parent trial as well as the donor experience trial.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Concealment of treatment allocation schedule</HEADING>
<P>Concealment of treatment allocation from the investigator was deemed adequate in the one trial that reported their methods for the generation of randomisation sequence (<LINK REF="STD-Kennedy-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Kennedy 2003</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Blinding of clinician, donor or outcome assessor to treatment allocation</HEADING>
<P>No trial reported that the assessors of outcome were blinded to treatment allocation or the generation of the randomisation sequence. It would be impossible to blind either the donors or clinicians to treatment allocation in this trial setting.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Minimum proportion of randomised participants included in the main analysis</HEADING>
<P>Only four studies had greater than 80% of randomised donors included in the main analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Favre-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Favre 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Heldal-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Heldal 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kennedy-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Kennedy 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rowley-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Rowley 2001</LINK>). In two of these studies (<LINK REF="STD-Kennedy-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Kennedy 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rowley-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Rowley 2001</LINK>), where the numbers included for analysis at each data point were reported, a minimum number of 80% was only available for the early data collection points: day 28 (<LINK REF="STD-Kennedy-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Kennedy 2003</LINK>) and day seven in the bone marrow arm and day one in the peripheral blood arm (<LINK REF="STD-Rowley-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Rowley 2001</LINK>). In the other two included studies (<LINK REF="STD-Bredeson-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Bredeson 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fortanier-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Fortanier 2002</LINK>), between 34% and 58% of randomised donors were included in the main analysis in one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Bredeson-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Bredeson 2004</LINK>). In the second trial (<LINK REF="STD-Fortanier-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Fortanier 2002</LINK>) the number of donors randomised was not reported in either the parent or donor experience trial.</P>
<P>Given that all included studies were substudies, or constituent parts of a larger RCT, a further aspect of methodological quality was explored. This aspect was the proportion of donors included in the donor experience trial in comparison to the parent trial, and the reasons for the non-inclusion of donors in the donor experience trial. See <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK> for full details. Two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Heldal-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Heldal 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kennedy-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Kennedy 2003</LINK>) included 100% of donors randomised in the parent trial in the donor experience trial and a third trial (<LINK REF="STD-Favre-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Favre 2003</LINK>) included 94% of randomised donors in both the parent and donor experience trial and provided an adequate and acceptable explanation for the loss.</P>
<P>Two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Bredeson-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Bredeson 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rowley-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Rowley 2001</LINK>) included less than 80% of donors randomised in the parent trial in the donor experience trial but do not clearly explain the reasons for doing this. It is therefore unclear whether the donors who were not included in the donor experience trial were in any way different (for example, clinically, in terms of their satisfaction or perception of the donor experience, or in the incidence of adverse events) to the donors included. Non-inclusion of 'different' donors may lead to misinterpretation of the findings for the donor experience trial and the drawing of inappropriate conclusions.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Equal use of co-interventions in each trial arm</HEADING>
<P>No included trial reported the use of co-interventions. Where reported, analgesics were available as required (<LINK REF="STD-Rowley-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Rowley 2001</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Detail of deviations from the protocol and of loss to follow up</HEADING>
<P>No trial reported details of deviations to protocol.</P>
<P>As noted above, the number of donors included in the analysis of each outcome varied within each trial (see <LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK>). No trial included all randomised donors in all outcome analyses. Four studies (<LINK REF="STD-Bredeson-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Bredeson 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Favre-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Favre 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Heldal-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Heldal 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kennedy-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Kennedy 2003</LINK>) did not report whether any donors had been lost to follow up. One trial (<LINK REF="STD-Fortanier-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Fortanier 2002</LINK>) did not provide enough details to assess what percentage of donors had been lost to follow up during the trial. One trial (<LINK REF="STD-Rowley-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Rowley 2001</LINK>) reported ten bone marrow donors (26%) and nine peripheral blood donors (29%) were lost to follow up by trial day +28.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Power calculation</HEADING>
<P>No trial determined sample size using a power calculation. One trial (<LINK REF="STD-Favre-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Favre 2003</LINK>) carried out an interim analysis after 20% of the desired number of donors had been randomised to assess safety and the adverse event episodes. This analysis revealed no concerns regarding the safety of the trial and no unexpected adverse events.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Pain</HEADING>
<P>Pain was assessed by questionnaire with responses recorded by the donor on a linear scale. See <LINK REF="TBL-04" TYPE="TABLE">Table 4</LINK> for full details.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Pain prior to the donation procedure</HEADING>
<P>Three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Favre-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Favre 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fortanier-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Fortanier 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rowley-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Rowley 2001</LINK>) reported pain prior to donation. This was recorded as the number of donors experiencing any pain (<LINK REF="STD-Favre-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Favre 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rowley-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Rowley 2001</LINK>) or as a mean pain score (<LINK REF="STD-Fortanier-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Fortanier 2002</LINK>). See <LINK REF="TBL-05" TYPE="TABLE">Table 5</LINK> for full trial details.</P>
<P>The majority of donors experienced pain prior to the donation procedure due to the administration of G-CSF. Favre (<LINK REF="STD-Favre-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Favre 2003</LINK>) reported musculoskeletal pain in 71 (43%) peripheral blood donors. Rowley (<LINK REF="STD-Rowley-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Rowley 2001</LINK>) reported that over 92% of peripheral blood donors experienced pain on days three to five of G-CSF administration. Fortanier (<LINK REF="STD-Fortanier-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Fortanier 2002</LINK>) reported the mean pain score as 3.2 cm (SD 2.8) (scores ranged from 0 cm = no pain to 10 cm = worst possible pain). The site of pain was not stated. In these three studies, pain prior to donation was experienced by peripheral blood donors only.</P>
<P>One study (<LINK REF="STD-Fortanier-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Fortanier 2002</LINK>) measured baseline levels of pain in bone marrow and peripheral blood donors in this study. Both bone marrow and peripheral blood donors reported low levels of pain prior to donation: the mean pain score was not significantly different between the donors (WMD 3.00 mm, 95% CI -6.52 to 12.52; see <LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>). The source and severity of the pain was not reported in this study.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Pain at donation site</HEADING>
<P>Five studies (<LINK REF="STD-Bredeson-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Bredeson 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Favre-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Favre 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fortanier-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Fortanier 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kennedy-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Kennedy 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rowley-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Rowley 2001</LINK>) reported the number of donors experiencing pain at the donation site. See <LINK REF="TBL-05" TYPE="TABLE">Table 5</LINK> for full trial details. Out of a total of 458 donors, 39% (91/234) of bone marrow donors experienced pain at the donation site compared to only 4% (9/224) of peripheral blood donors. Fortanier (<LINK REF="STD-Fortanier-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Fortanier 2002</LINK>) measured mean pain score during the collection procedure (N = 64). There was no difference in mean pain score between the two groups (WMD 5.00 mm, 95% CI -6.06 to 16.06; see <LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Pain subsequent to donation</HEADING>
<P>All six studies (<LINK REF="STD-Bredeson-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Bredeson 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Favre-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Favre 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fortanier-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Fortanier 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Heldal-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Heldal 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kennedy-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Kennedy 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rowley-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Rowley 2001</LINK>) measured pain subsequent to donation. Four studies reported the number of donors experiencing pain by site of pain (<LINK REF="STD-Bredeson-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Bredeson 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Favre-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Favre 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Heldal-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Heldal 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kennedy-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Kennedy 2003</LINK>) and two studies reported mean pain score (<LINK REF="STD-Fortanier-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Fortanier 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rowley-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Rowley 2001</LINK>). The time-point at which this outcome was measured differed across the studies. See <LINK REF="TBL-05" TYPE="TABLE">Table 5</LINK> for full trial details.</P>
<P>In the four studies reporting the numbers of donors experiencing pain subsequent to donation, more peripheral blood donors experienced pain at one week (<LINK REF="STD-Bredeson-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Bredeson 2004</LINK>) and two weeks (<LINK REF="STD-Heldal-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Heldal 2002</LINK>) in comparison to bone marrow donors. At one month, more bone marrow than peripheral blood donors reported experiencing pain (<LINK REF="STD-Favre-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Favre 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kennedy-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Kennedy 2003</LINK>). Across all studies back pain was the commonest site of pain and was consistently reported by more bone marrow (23%) than peripheral blood (14%) donors.</P>
<P>The source of the pain was far more varied in the peripheral blood donors than bone marrow donors. In two studies, peripheral blood donors reported bone pain, injection site pain, joint pain (<LINK REF="STD-Bredeson-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Bredeson 2004</LINK>), myalgia, skeletal, abdominal and chest pain (<LINK REF="STD-Heldal-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Heldal 2002</LINK>). In these studies, no bone marrow donor experienced any of these symptoms.</P>
<P>In the two studies reporting mean pain score, one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Fortanier-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Fortanier 2002</LINK>) measured mean pain score a few hours after stem cell donation. There was no difference in mean pain score between the two groups (WMD -6.00 mm, 95% CI -16.84 to 4.84; see <LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>). The source of pain was not stated. Rowley (<LINK REF="STD-Rowley-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Rowley 2001</LINK>) reported mean scores for worst pain, average pain, pain duration, pain interfering with sleep from baseline through to day 14 on an 11-point scale, where 0 = no pain and 10 = maximal pain. There was no significant difference between bone marrow and peripheral blood donors or between time-points measured on any assessment.</P>
<P>
<B>In all six studies, pain subsequent to donation was experienced by both groups of donors. Overall, peripheral blood donors experienced more pain up to 14 days following donation whilst bone marrow donors experienced more pain at one month following donation. Back pain was the commonest source of pain and was reported by more bone marrow than peripheral blood donors. </B>

</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Any adverse events</HEADING>
<P>All six studies reported the occurrence of other adverse events. See <LINK REF="TBL-06" TYPE="TABLE">Table 6</LINK> for full details. In four studies, pre-specified adverse events were listed on a questionnaire (<LINK REF="STD-Bredeson-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Bredeson 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fortanier-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Fortanier 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kennedy-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Kennedy 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rowley-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Rowley 2001</LINK>). In the other two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Favre-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Favre 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Heldal-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Heldal 2002</LINK>) donors were able to list the adverse events they experienced. Data were not pooled in a meta-analysis due to differing time-points used to measure the occurrence of adverse events across the studies. No trial reported exactly when the adverse events occurred or the duration of the adverse events.</P>
<P>Non-pain adverse events generally occurred in &lt; 10% of donors and were clearly of limited significance with regard to the donor's future health. Bone marrow donors reported more "any harvest related adverse event", e.g. nausea, vomiting and limpness/weakness, whereas more peripheral blood donors reported sleep disturbance. The number of donors reporting syncope and dyspnoea was similar between the two groups.</P>
<P>The following symptoms were only reported in bone marrow donors: vomiting, chills, pain on swallowing, tinnitus and pruritis. The following were only reported in peripheral blood donors: palpitations, fever, hypoglycaemia, hypocalcaemia, increased lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and alkaline phosphatase levels.</P>
<P>In Favre (<LINK REF="STD-Favre-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Favre 2003</LINK>) the number of donors reporting any adverse event was greater in the peripheral blood donors (peripheral blood: N = 107, 65%; bone marrow: N = 95, 57%). Favre (<LINK REF="STD-Favre-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Favre 2003</LINK>) reported that 96% of all reported adverse events were mild to moderate, and transient. More severe adverse events were reported in 4% of donors. For peripheral blood donors, these included: thrombocytopenia (two), chest pain (one), hypertension (one), hypoglycaemia (one), somnolence (one) hypocalcaemia and tetany (one); for bone marrow donors, severe vomiting post-general anaesthetic (one) and anaemia requiring transfusion (one).</P>
<P>Rowley (<LINK REF="STD-Rowley-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Rowley 2001</LINK>) reported the hospitalisation of one patient who developed a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) six days after bone marrow harvest. One peripheral blood donor developed superficial phlebitis of an arm vein and another peripheral blood donor developed a large painful haematoma at the site of the femoral vein apheresis catheter. Both of these resolved with symptomatic treatment only.</P>
<P>There were no life threatening adverse events reported.<B>
<BR/>
</B>
</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Haemorrhage, anaemia and hypotension</HEADING>
<P>We evaluated three adverse events more closely, on the basis of clinical significance: haemorrhage, anaemia and hypotension. With the exception of haemorrhage in one peripheral blood donor (no specific details given) (<LINK REF="STD-Kennedy-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Kennedy 2003</LINK>), these adverse events only occurred in bone marrow donors. Haemorrhage was reported in two (8%) bone marrow donors in Kennedy (<LINK REF="STD-Kennedy-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Kennedy 2003</LINK>) and five (13%) bone marrow donors in Rowley (<LINK REF="STD-Rowley-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Rowley 2001</LINK>). There are no indications to suggest that the haemorrhage was life threatening nor that it required admission to hospital.</P>
<P>Favre reported anaemia in 17 (10%) bone marrow donors (<LINK REF="STD-Favre-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Favre 2003</LINK>) although only one donor required a red cell transfusion (two units). Heldal reported one female donor with a significant anaemia post-harvest (7.4 g/dL), who needed nine days in hospital because of weakness and dizziness (<LINK REF="STD-Heldal-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Heldal 2002</LINK>). Hypotension was reported in 13 (34%) bone marrow donors in the few days post-donation (<LINK REF="STD-Rowley-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Rowley 2001</LINK>).</P>

<P>Two studies reported the number of donors experiencing restricted activity at seven days following donation (<LINK REF="STD-Favre-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Favre 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kennedy-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Kennedy 2003</LINK>). There was no significant difference between the donor arms in terms of the numbers experiencing restricted activity (RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.36; see <LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-002.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.1</LINK>). One trial (<LINK REF="STD-Favre-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Favre 2003</LINK>) reported data beyond seven days following donation. No peripheral blood donor reported restricted activity beyond day 23. In the bone marrow group, all donors resumed normal activity before day 100, except one woman who suffered severe back pain, especially in cold weather, until day 192.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Severity of discomfort</HEADING>
<P>One trial (<LINK REF="STD-Heldal-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Heldal 2002</LINK>) reported severity of discomfort following donation. Ten peripheral blood donors (33%) graded their limitations as severe compared to 23 (82%) bone marrow donors. The severity of discomfort associated with 10 common activities was measured. For all activities, the mean discomfort score was greater in the bone marrow donors. This difference was statistically significant for five activities: running; using stairs; bending, carrying or lifting; walking on level ground and sitting (P &lt; 0.001).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Difficulty walking</HEADING>
<P>Difficulty in walking was reported by two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Kennedy-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Kennedy 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rowley-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Rowley 2001</LINK>). Rowley (<LINK REF="STD-Rowley-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Rowley 2001</LINK>) reported 22 (73%) bone marrow donors and (9%) peripheral blood donors had difficulty walking at day seven. Kennedy (<LINK REF="STD-Kennedy-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Kennedy 2003</LINK>) found no statistically significant difference between the two groups in relation to difficulty walking at day 28.</P>

<B>Across the five studies, BM donors tended to experience more days of restricted activity, had more mean discomfort and a greater number were still experiencing restricted activity at 7, 14 and 28 days post-bone marrow harvest.

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Psychological morbidity</HEADING>
<P>Three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Bredeson-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Bredeson 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fortanier-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Fortanier 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rowley-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Rowley 2001</LINK>) reported data on psychological morbidity. Each trial used a different tool to measure psychological morbidity. See <LINK REF="TBL-08" TYPE="TABLE">Table 8</LINK> for full details of the results.</P>
<P>Bredeson (<LINK REF="STD-Bredeson-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Bredeson 2004</LINK>) measured psychological morbidity using the Short Form 36 (SF-36) and Profile of Mood States (POMS) quality of life questionnaires. Data were only reported for those donors who had completed both pre- and post-donation questionnaires (bone marrow: 55% and peripheral blood: 34% of donors randomised into the trial). Overall at four weeks from donation, only two dimensions on the SF-36 questionnaire were statistically significant between the two groups. Bone marrow donors experienced more role limitation due to physical health problems and bodily pain compared to peripheral blood donors.</P>
<P>The POMS questionnaire provides an overall total mood disturbance (TMD) score and individual scores on six dimensions. Overall, bone marrow donors reported increased mood disturbance between pre-donation and one week following donation (result significant at P = 0.02), whilst mood disturbance was marginally reduced for peripheral blood donors. With the exception of anger, the trend for change in individual mood state from pre- to post-donation was the same in both groups. Mean change from pre to post-donation was greatest for both donor groups in the dimensions of fatigue (increased), anxiety (decreased) and energy (decreased).</P>
<P>Fortanier (<LINK REF="STD-Fortanier-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Fortanier 2002</LINK>) measured psychological morbidity using a modified version of the Spielberger's 40-item State-Trait Anxiety Inventory. Levels of "state anxiety" before the collection procedure were higher in the peripheral blood group (45 +/- 29) than in the bone marrow group (35 +/-13) but were of no difference at the end of the procedure. However, state anxiety levels decreased immediately after donation in both trial arms. In addition, 90% of bone marrow donors and 73% of peripheral blood donors stated that they had found the procedure "quite" or "very easy".</P>
<P>Rowley (<LINK REF="STD-Rowley-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Rowley 2001</LINK>) measured psychological morbidity by assessing donors' emotional status at day 14 following stem cell donation on an 11-point scale (0 = poor to 10 = excellent). No statistically significant difference in mean "emotional status" at day 14 following stem cell donation was found (P = 0.40).</P>

No deaths were reported in two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Favre-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Favre 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rowley-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Rowley 2001</LINK>). In the other two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Heldal-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Heldal 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kennedy-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Kennedy 2003</LINK>), three deaths occurred, all in peripheral blood donors. One death at 23 months was due to a myocardial infarction, the second at 28 months due to a subarachnoid haemorrhage (<LINK REF="STD-Kennedy-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Kennedy 2003</LINK>). The third death occurred at 26 months due to a pulmonary embolism (<LINK REF="STD-Heldal-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Heldal 2002</LINK>). There was no statistical significance in mortality rate: RR 0.25 (95% CI 0.03 to 2.15; see <LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-003.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.1</LINK>). This donor had donated stem cells both peripherally and through a bone marrow harvest. However, his blood counts one year post-harvest were within the normal range.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Other outcomes</HEADING>
<P>Two studies reported the willingness of donors to donate again (<LINK REF="STD-Bredeson-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Bredeson 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Heldal-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Heldal 2002</LINK>). In one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Bredeson-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Bredeson 2004</LINK>), more bone marrow donors than peripheral blood donors would be willing to donate again (bone marrow: 81%; peripheral blood: 71%). In the second trial (<LINK REF="STD-Heldal-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Heldal 2002</LINK>) all donors would be willing to donate again if asked. Of peripheral blood donors, 98% would be happy to donate by the same method whilst 34% of bone marrow donors would prefer to donate by an alternative method if one was available. The reasons for this were side effects of the general anaesthetic, inability to visit the recipient on the day of transplantation and the need for sick leave following donation.</P>
<P>Heldal (<LINK REF="STD-Heldal-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Heldal 2002</LINK>) reported donor requirements for analgesics following the procedure. The requirement for analgesics was greater in the peripheral blood donors (median four tablets) compared to bone marrow donors (median 0 tablets). This difference was statistically significant at P = 0.003.</P>
<P>Heldal (<LINK REF="STD-Heldal-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Heldal 2002</LINK>) also assessed blood counts in peripheral blood donors at baseline, 28 days and one year post-harvest. There was a six-fold increase of leukocytes on days four and five of G-CSF administration. Two days after stopping the injections, the value had more than halved. Twenty-eight days after the procedure the median leukocyte count was back to pre-treatment level. Platelet counts always dropped and the decrease was proportional to the number of leukaphereses. In 13 cases, it dropped below 100 x 10<SUP>9</SUP>/L. In one donor a count of 49 was recorded two days after the third leukapheresis. However, there was no bleeding and platelet transfusion was not necessary.</P>
<P>At day 28, all PB donors had a bone marrow aspirate performed to assess the effect of G-CSF on morphology and differentiation. There were no morphological abnormalities seen. A transient rise of serum alkaline phosphatase, lactic dehydrogenases and uric acid was observed during mobilisation of peripheral blood donors. The values were within the reference range by three weeks post-harvest. Unfortunately, these values are only reported for the peripheral blood group (<LINK REF="STD-Heldal-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Heldal 2002</LINK>). The two groups were compared at one year and there was no difference in the blood counts at that time (<LINK REF="STD-Heldal-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Heldal 2002</LINK>).</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2008-10-30 16:56:17 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Whilst, understandably, much of the literature is focused on outcomes for the haemopoietic stem cell transplant recipient, it is important not to forget the risks for the donors. Both techniques of haemopoietic stem cell donation are associated with recognised adverse events. Some of these events can be readily recorded as pain or bruising at the site of marrow aspiration, but other risks are more difficult to quantify accurately, e.g. the use of granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF). Whilst not shown to have a causative role in the development of myelodysplasia or acute myeloid leukaemia (MDS/AML), it may be associated with a small but presumably finite risk of precipitating MDS/AML in susceptible individuals. Donors must be counselled about this (<LINK REF="REF-Bennett-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bennett 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Goldman-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goldman 2006</LINK>). The aim of this review was to identify and compare the adverse events associated with both methods of haemopoietic stem cell donation systematically, based on the randomised controlled trial literature.</P>
<P>We identified six randomised controlled trials that met the inclusion criteria. However, none of these studies was designed with the sole aim of recording outcomes and experiences of the donors. They were substudies of larger trials of stem cell transplantation. There was significant difficulty in comparing the results from different studies due to the lack of common assessment tools or definitions of events. This lack of consistency meant that the results of this review were largely limited to a descriptive analysis.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Summary of main findings</HEADING>
<P>The main overall findings of the review were as follows.</P>
<UL>
<LI>Donors in both arms (peripheral blood stem cell collection or bone marrow aspiration) experienced pain subsequent to donation, with evidence of psychological morbidity.</LI>
<LI>Bone marrow donors experienced more pain at the donation site, more overall adverse events, more days of restricted activity and were more likely to require hospitalisation.</LI>
<LI>Peripheral blood stem cell donors experienced more pain prior to donation which may be related to the pre-donation administration of G-CSF.</LI>
</UL>
<P>It is not unexpected that bone marrow donors have more symptoms and restriction of activity than peripheral blood donors, due to the actual method of donation involving multiple punctures of the iliac crests. This, together with the need for general/spinal anaesthesia might explain the increase in days of restricted activity and need for hospitalisation. Although the tests used to assess psychological morbidity were different in each of the three studies that reported this, there was no clear evidence that one form of intervention was more deleterious to psychological health.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Methodological quality</HEADING>
<P>The methodological quality of the studies was difficult to assess. Assessment of the parent studies from which these donor studies originated was required to fully understand the methodological quality. Patients requiring stem cell transplant were presumably asked to participate in a trial assessing their outcome relative to the method of stem cell collection; if they consented to this parent trial, the donor was then asked to participate in this secondary trial assessing the donor morbidity.</P>
<P>The methodological quality of the studies was generally poor with only one trial using adequate methods to generate the randomisation sequence and only four of the six studies including more than 80% of randomised donors in the outcome analysis. This is surprising given that long-term follow up was a maximum of seven days post procedure in four of the six donor studies. By far the most overwhelming concern is the proportion of donors from the parent trial not included in the donor trial and the lack of explanation given for this difference. This is an issue because the demographic and clinical characteristics of the non-included donors could differ from those of the included donors with a significant risk of selection bias.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Other adverse events</HEADING>
<P>With the exception of one deep vein thrombosis, no immediate life threatening events were reported, but the numbers were small. No serious long-term effects, such as development of leukaemia, particularly in donors receiving G-CSF, were reported. However, follow up would almost certainly have ceased by the time that such an event occurred. The incidence in the general population is so low that many thousands of donors would need to be followed up in order to identify an increased risk due to the donation procedure. For acute myeloid leukaemia, based on an annual incidence in the US of 5/100,000, which translates into a cumulative incidence of 0.05% at 10 years, it has been estimated that even if the risk was increased ten-fold by G-CSF, it would be necessary to follow up over 2000 donors for a period of 10 years to identify the increase (<LINK REF="REF-Hasenclever-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hasenclever 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>Other reported rare side effects of G-CSF administration have included spontaneous rupture of the spleen, precipitation of severe sickle crisis and flare-ups of autoimmune disease (e.g. exacerbation of ankylosing spondylitis and ulcerative colitis) (<LINK REF="REF-Pamphilon-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pamphilon 2008</LINK>). None of these adverse events were reported in the studies that we reviewed.</P>
<P>Three deaths occurred in peripheral blood donors at 23, 26 and 28 months post-donation. It is unlikely that stem cell donation contributed to any of these deaths as they all occurred about two years later.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">The donors</HEADING>
<P>In all six studies the donor was related to the recipient. Related donors have a stronger motivation and may under report symptoms as well as accept a greater level of morbidity than unrelated donors. It is possible that unrelated volunteer donors are rejected if they have any clinically significant problems at pre-donation evaluation which may not always be the case in related donors. It is also possible that related donors will be accepted with conditions such as diabetes or mild heart disease after a full discussion and having given written informed consent. Therefore pre-donation morbidity may differ significantly between related and unrelated donors. This distinction is important as an increasing proportion of donors are now unrelated volunteer donors. In 2005, 8890 allogeneic stem cell transplants were reported to the European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) and 41% of these used unrelated donors; about 70% of these transplants received peripheral blood stem cells (<LINK REF="REF-Gratwohl-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gratwohl 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>It should also be acknowledged that the expectations of donors may play a role in the emotional and physical status reported after donation. For example, one report stated "It is possible that PBSC donors expect minimal side effects and their emotional status might have suffered when symptoms were worse than expected. Marrow donors by contrast perhaps had more realistic expectations of the procedure and may have felt relatively better for meeting the challenges of donation" (<LINK REF="STD-Rowley-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Rowley 2001</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Conclusions</HEADING>
<P>The aim of this systematic review was to evaluate the comparative risks of hematopoietic stem cell donation between bone marrow harvesting and peripheral blood collection. Six randomised trials were eligible for appraisal. However, the analysis of combined data was limited by heterogeneity in methods of outcome assessment, including definitions of endpoints. Based on a descriptive analysis, the different morbidities associated with each type of donation were clear and bone marrow donors experienced more pain and have more restriction post-donation than peripheral blood donors. No donor appears to have any long-term sequelae from the process of donating stem cells, but the small numbers preclude meaningful assessment.</P>
<P>It is unfortunate that all studies collected their data in different ways and at differing time-points. Further studies should use global measures of quality of life to measure outcomes in donor studies. These measures, e.g. SF-36, are developed for a non-diseased population and are therefore potentially very relevant to this group of participants. In addition, a specific pain measure could then be added, which would allow an evaluation of the donor's perception of their quality of life, including pain, at baseline, during the procedure and at follow up. The baseline measurement is paramount as it is from these pre-procedural measures that any significant differences between the two groups can be determined.</P>
<P>Alternative designs of large observational studies or registries might also be expected to provide complimentary information to understand the relative risks associated with both methods of stem cell donation, particularly if the events are low frequency or long-term. A significant issue for this review was the small size of the trials identified, since by contrast Bone Marrow Donors Worldwide holds data on over 12 million donors. However, the randomised controlled trial provides a means of directly comparing adverse events in the context of a trial design which can be appraised from a methodological perspective.</P>

<P>Given the limitations of our data, there does not seem to be any reason to promote one method of donation as safer than the other. They have different side effect profiles and all donors should have the nature of the procedure and its possible adverse effects explained to them. All adult donors must give valid informed consent.  However, the method of donation is usually specified by the transplant centre and is selected on the basis of best predicted outcome for the recipient.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2008-10-30 16:56:17 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The lessons from this review, including the need for common and standardised methods of recording outcomes, such as psychological morbidity or differences in functioning, need to be considered in new studies. Long-term adverse events, for example development of myelodysplastic syndrome or acute myeloid leukaemia, need to be considered and evaluated through Research on Adverse Drug Events and Reports (RADR). A method for recording these long-term outcomes should be built into new studies. New studies should also evaluate outcomes for unrelated donors, and these studies should preferably be designed in their own right, rather than as substudies of recipient trials. This may have been one factor contributing to the variable proportions of donors from the parent trial not included in the donor trial of the trials identified in this systematic review.</P>
