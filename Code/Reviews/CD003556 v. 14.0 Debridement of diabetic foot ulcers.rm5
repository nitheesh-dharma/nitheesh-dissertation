<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2010-02-17 14:26:11 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>People with diabetes often develop foot ulcers (open sores on the feet that go through the skin), which are a serious complication and can themselves result in serious consequences such as amputation. Cleaning and removing dead tissue and callus from the ulcers is a common procedure also know as "debridement" and can be done in several ways, including surgery and special dressings and gels (such as hydrogels). The review found that hydrogel results in faster healing than gauze or standard care. The evidence for other debriding strategies is unclear.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2010-02-17 10:23:57 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Six RCTs of debridement were identified: four assessed hydrogels, with an additional study evaluating larval therapy against hydrogel and one evaluated surgical debridement. Pooling the three RCTs which compared hydrogel with gauze or standard care suggested that hydrogels are significantly more effective in healing diabetic foot ulcers (Relative Risk 1.84, 95% Confidence Interval (CI)1.3 to 2.61). Surgical debridement showed no significant benefit over standard treatment. One small trial, available in abstract form only, suggested that larvae resulted in a greater reduction in wound area compared with hydrogel, but this evidence has not been confirmed by publication of full trial results. Other debridement methods such as enzyme preparations or polysaccharide beads have not been evaluated in diabetic foot ulcers.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2010-02-17 14:25:10 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is evidence to suggest that hydrogel increases the healing rate of diabetic foot ulcers compared with gauze dressings or standard care. There is insufficient evidence (one small trial, abstract only) of the effects of larval therapy on diabetic foot ulcers. More research is needed to evaluate the effects of a range of widely used debridement methods and of debridement per se.</P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2011-12-05 19:07:19 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2009-10-23 11:18:51 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Approximately 2% of the UK population is estimated to have diabetes, of whom approximately 200,000 have Type 1 diabetes and more than a million have Type 2 diabetes (<LINK REF="REF-Calman-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Calman 1998</LINK>). Foot ulceration is thought to affect 15% of people with diabetes at some time in their lives (<LINK REF="REF-Spencer-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spencer 2000</LINK>). The complications of diabetes are not limited to the foot; other complications can affect the eyes (cataracts, retinopathy or neurological disturbances), kidneys (due to sclerotic renal disorder peculiar to diabetes), vascular and neurological complications. In addition diabetes renders people more prone to pulmonary tuberculosis, Candida skin infections and other opportunistic infections (<LINK REF="REF-Davies-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davies 1989</LINK>). People with diabetes are between 15 and 70 times more likely to undergo lower limb amputations than people without diabetes (<LINK REF="REF-SIGN-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">SIGN 1997</LINK>). Prevalence of amputations due to diabetes (excludes loss of toes or single metatarsals) in Scotland is 1% of people with diabetes (<LINK REF="REF-SIGN-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">SIGN 1997</LINK>); the total UK figure is thought to be similar (<LINK REF="REF-Macleod-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Macleod 1991</LINK>). However there is some uncertainty as to the true incidence and prevalence of diabetic foot ulcers as much of the treatment is delivered within the community and outpatients departments where data collection is patchy and surveillance is limited. The cost of the amputation itself is only a small part of the total care, since most patients who have an amputation have many admissions before and after surgery with the average length of stay over 200 days (<LINK REF="REF-SIGN-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">SIGN 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>The cost to the UK National Health Service of diabetic foot ulcers is thought to be about £13 million per year (<LINK REF="REF-King_x0027_s-Fund-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">King's Fund 1996</LINK>). However, such costings do not take into account the personal costs to the patient, e.g. a reduction in ability to work; time taken off work; altered body image; worry and threat of amputation; dressing regimens and hospital visits.</P>
<P>Health professionals with an interest in diabetes met in St Vincent over 10 years ago to review the problem of diabetes complications. Many standards for diabetes care were agreed at this meeting, including a 50% reduction in lower limb amputations by the year 1995 (<LINK REF="REF-SVD-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">SVD 1990</LINK>).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Aetiology of Diabetic Foot Ulcers</HEADING>
<P>The breakdown of the diabetic foot has traditionally been considered to be the result of peripheral vascular disease, peripheral neuropathy and infection. More recently, other contributory causes, such as psychosocial factors have been implicated (<LINK REF="REF-Boulton-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boulton 2000</LINK>).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Vascular Pathology</HEADING>
<P>Disease of blood vessels is a major cause of complications in diabetes and affects all types of vessel (<LINK REF="REF-Faris-1991a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Faris 1991a</LINK>). The Framingham study reported that more than 50% of men and women with diabetes had absent foot pulses (<LINK REF="REF-Abbott-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Abbott 1990</LINK>). Peripheral vascular disease (PVD) tends to occur at a younger age in people with diabetes and is more likely to involve smaller blood vessels further away from the heart. Reports from USA, UK and Finland (<LINK REF="REF-Pecoraro-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pecoraro 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Reiber-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reiber 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Siitonen-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Siitonen 1993</LINK>) have confirmed that PVD is a major contributory factor in the pathogenesis of foot ulceration and subsequent major amputations (<LINK REF="REF-Boulton-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boulton 2000</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Neuropathy</HEADING>
<P>Impairment of nerve function is an important and frequent complication of diabetes. All types of nerve fibres can be involved including motor, sensory and autonomic nerves and the associated functions affected. Impaired nerve function in the foot is common in people with diabetes although the person themselves may be unaware of its presence. Neuropathy remains one of the major factors leading to the development of foot lesions in people with diabetes (<LINK REF="REF-Le-Quesne-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Le Quesne 1991</LINK>).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Sensory neuropathy</HEADING>
<P>Damage to the nerves carrying signals from the foot renders the foot insensitive to temperature, vibration, pressure and pain and is referred to as sensory neuropathy. The loss of sensation means that small injuries often go undetected.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Motor neuropathy</HEADING>
<P>Denervation of muscles has important effects on the function of the foot. The small muscles of the foot, the extensor digitorum brevis, lumbrical and interosseus muscles are commonly affected. Paralysis of these small muscles results in the metatarsophalangeal joints becoming hyper extended and the interphalangeal joints becoming flexed. The joints initially remain mobile but later degenerative changes occur and the joints become fixed (<LINK REF="REF-Le-Quesne-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Le Quesne 1991</LINK>). The consequence of such muscle wastage is a foot shape that increases foot pressures.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Autonomic neuropathy</HEADING>
<P>Autonomic neuropathy is thought to contribute to the pathogenesis of ulceration, neuropathic oedema and Charcot arthropathy (<LINK REF="REF-Le-Quesne-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Le Quesne 1991</LINK>). Impairment of sweating is suggested to contribute, through dehydration, to the formation of hyperkeratotic plaques and fissures in the skin. If this callus (increased glycation of keratin) is allowed to become too thick, it presses on the soft tissues underneath causing ulceration (<LINK REF="REF-Edmonds-2000a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Edmonds 2000a</LINK>). Callus is defined as a build up of keratinised skin, in reaction to persistent pressure (<LINK REF="REF-Cutting-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cutting 1999</LINK>), and will itself exert pressure.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Pathway to Ulceration</HEADING>
<P>Despite the presence of predisposing factors such as peripheral vascular disease and peripheral neuropathy, an uninjured foot may not develop serious problems. However physical trauma is a potent cause of trouble e.g. a puncture wound, localised pressure, repeated mechanical trauma, heat or chemical injury (<LINK REF="REF-Faris-1991b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Faris 1991b</LINK>). Where there is sensory impairment, a small lesion may progress because it is not recognised and the source of injury not removed. Impairment of the blood supply may result in delayed healing. Infection is also an important factor responsible for increasing the amount of damaged tissue (<LINK REF="REF-Faris-1991b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Faris 1991b</LINK>). It is the infection, which increases the amount of damaged tissue present at the initial site of the damage. An ulcer is the result of a break in the dermal barrier, with subsequent erosion of underlying subcutaneous tissue. In severe cases, the breach may be extended to muscle and bone. Lack of sensation allows the damage to progress to ulceration. The progression to ulceration can be attributed to an impaired arterial supply, neuropathy, musculo-skeletal deformities, or a combination of these factors (<LINK REF="REF-Bauer-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bauer 2000</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Current practice</HEADING>
<P>Debridement is the removal of devitalised, contaminated or foreign material from within or adjacent to a wound, until surrounding healthy tissue is exposed and it is widely practised in diabetic foot care (<LINK REF="REF-Dorland_x0027_s-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dorland's 1998</LINK>). Debridement is also widely regarded as an effective intervention to speed up ulcer healing. It is widely believed that sharp debridement of an ulcer, including the removal of callus (which may surround or 'roof over' the ulcer) and all devitalised tissue is essential to healing, though direct evidence of this is lacking. Once an ulcer has developed the aim is to heal it in as short a time period as possible and prevent recurrence. Margolis conducted a meta analysis of the control group healing of 10 treatment trials in people with diabetic neuropathic foot ulcers and estimated that 24% heal within 12 weeks and 31% by 20 weeks with good wound care (<LINK REF="REF-Margolis-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Margolis 1999</LINK>). High quality management of the diabetic foot is generally regarded as requiring multidisciplinary input and good communication between primary and secondary care providers (<LINK REF="REF-Young-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Young 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>Edmonds (<LINK REF="REF-Edmonds-2000b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Edmonds 2000b</LINK>) suggests six aspects of "control" to be addressed when caring for people with diabetes, particularly in relation to foot health:</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Debridement</HEADING>
<P>Debridement (<I>see</I> <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK> Methods of debridement)<B> </B>is recommended by the SIGN diabetic foot guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-SIGN-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">SIGN 1997</LINK>) alongside antibiotic therapy for infection and pressure relief as a treatment for patients who have developed ulceration or gangrene with risk of amputation. The Royal College of General Practitioners' Guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-RCGP-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">RCGP 2000</LINK>) also recommend debridement as a treatment of the ulcerated foot alongside local wound management and appropriate dressings. Neither of the guidelines recommend a specific method of debridement.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Edmonds-2000b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Edmonds 2000b</LINK> gave the following rationale for debridement of neuropathic ulcers; it:</P>
<UL>
<LI>enables the true dimensions of the ulcer to be perceived</LI>
<LI>allows drainage of exudate and removal of dead tissue, both render infection less likely</LI>
<LI>enables a deep swab to be taken for culture</LI>
<LI>encourages healing.</LI>

<P>Six eligible randomised control trials (RCTs) were identified. Five out of six evaluated the effectiveness of a hydrogel as a method of debridement against a range of comparators.</P>
<P>The first hydrogel trial compared the effectiveness of sodium carboxymethylcellulose (NaCMC) aqueous based-gel (hydrogel) plus good wound care with good wound care alone (<LINK REF="STD-D_x0027_Hemecourt-1998" TYPE="STUDY">D'Hemecourt 1998</LINK>). In this trial good wound care for all groups consisted of initial and ongoing sharp debridement of ulcers when necessary to remove nonviable tissue, daily saline dressing changes, off loading of pressure and systematic control of infection if present. One trial compared a hydrogel wound dressing (HWD) with wet-to-moist saline gauze (<LINK REF="STD-Jensen-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Jensen 1998</LINK>). The third hydrogel trial compared an "immunomodulating" hydrogel, containing 65% glycerin (giving it a bacteriostatic action), with dry gauze (<LINK REF="STD-Vandeputte-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Vandeputte 1997</LINK>). A fourth hydrogel trial compared the effectiveness of hydrogel with larval therapy (<LINK REF="STD-Markevich-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Markevich 2000</LINK>). A fifth hydrogel trial compared the effectiveness of two alternative hydrogels (<LINK REF="STD-Whalley-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Whalley 2001</LINK>) although the extent to which the composition of the different hydrogels differed is unclear from the reports.</P>
<P>The sixth trial compared surgical debridement with conservative, non-surgical debridement (consisting of weight-bearing relief and regular dressings) (<LINK REF="STD-Piaggessi-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Piaggessi 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>Only two trials identified neuropathy as the primary aetiology of the included wounds (<LINK REF="STD-Markevich-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Markevich 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Piaggessi-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Piaggessi 1998</LINK>). Four trials did not report on the primary aetiology and classified the wounds merely as "diabetic foot ulcers".</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Inclusion / exclusion criteria</HEADING>
<P>The reporting of inclusion and exclusion criteria was extremely variable amongst the six trials with only. <LINK REF="STD-D_x0027_Hemecourt-1998" TYPE="STUDY">D'Hemecourt 1998</LINK> reporting precise inclusion and exclusion criteria. Although <LINK REF="STD-Jensen-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Jensen 1998</LINK> had clear inclusion criteria, no exclusion criteria were listed: in such cases where criteria were not listed, it was presumed that all people with diabetic foot ulcers were eligible for inclusion in the trial. <LINK REF="STD-Markevich-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Markevich 2000</LINK> makes no reference to inclusion or exclusion criteria. Three trials (<LINK REF="STD-Markevich-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Markevich 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Piaggessi-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Piaggessi 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vandeputte-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Vandeputte 1997</LINK>) entered people with diabetic foot ulcers into their trials regardless of ulcer size, depth, duration or blood supply. <LINK REF="STD-Vandeputte-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Vandeputte 1997</LINK> had a single exclusion criterion of patients receiving systemic antibiotics. <LINK REF="STD-Whalley-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Whalley 2001</LINK> has only been reported as a series of conference abstracts with limited data available: authors were contacted for more information which was not forthcoming (see <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Sample size</HEADING>
<P>Small sample size was the major deficiency of most of these trials. Two of the trials (<LINK REF="STD-D_x0027_Hemecourt-1998" TYPE="STUDY">D'Hemecourt 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Markevich-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Markevich 2000</LINK>) recruited 140 patients or more. <LINK REF="STD-D_x0027_Hemecourt-1998" TYPE="STUDY">D'Hemecourt 1998</LINK> conducted a three arm trial, involving 172 patients and was the largest study included. One trial (<LINK REF="STD-Whalley-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Whalley 2001</LINK>) recruited 74 patients; the other three trials each recruited fewer than 50 patients.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Study Settings</HEADING>
<P>The study setting was described in two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Jensen-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Jensen 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Piaggessi-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Piaggessi 1998</LINK>) where patients were seen in the outpatients' department. Only one trial stated that the source of patients was the diabetic foot clinic (<LINK REF="STD-Piaggessi-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Piaggessi 1998</LINK>); the five remaining trials did not state where participants were recruited from. The primary outcome of all six trials was complete wound closure, either the time taken to achieve complete wound closure or the proportions of wounds achieving complete wound closure were reported. Three of the trials reported healing rates as an outcome (<LINK REF="STD-D_x0027_Hemecourt-1998" TYPE="STUDY">D'Hemecourt 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jensen-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Jensen 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Piaggessi-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Piaggessi 1998</LINK>).</P>

<P>A risk of bias assessment was conducted for each of the included trials (see <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>). Reporting of the conduct of trials was poor across all six included studies, so that it was difficult to evaluate each trial for potential sources of bias. Sequence generation and allocation concealment were not reported for any of the six trials. Blinding of outcome assessors was only reported by <LINK REF="STD-D_x0027_Hemecourt-1998" TYPE="STUDY">D'Hemecourt 1998</LINK>.

<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>)</P>
<P>Random allocation to intervention groups remains the only method of ensuring that the only systematic difference between the treatment groups is the intervention itself, thus eliminating selection bias. The success of randomisation depends on two interrelated processes. The first entails generating a sequence by which participants in a trial are allocated to intervention groups. To ensure unpredictability of that allocation sequence, investigators should generate it by a random process (e.g. computer generated numbers, random number tables or coin flipping) (<LINK REF="REF-EBN-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">EBN 2001</LINK>). Sequence generation was not reported for any of the six included trials.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Allocation concealment</HEADING>
<P>This is the part of the allocation process and shields those involved in the trial from knowing upcoming assignments in advance. Without this protection, investigators have been known to change who gets the next assignment, thus introducing selection bias (<LINK REF="REF-EBN-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">EBN 2001</LINK>). Because of poor reporting, we could not be confident that allocation was concealed in any of the included trials.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Blinding</HEADING>
<P>Blinding of participants and of personnel delivering the intervention was not clear across all included studies. Of the six RCTs in this review, we could be confident that blinded outcome assessment had been used in only one trial (<LINK REF="STD-D_x0027_Hemecourt-1998" TYPE="STUDY">D'Hemecourt 1998</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Markevich-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Markevich 2000</LINK> reported that the study was double blinded, although they did not report who was blinded (it may be any or all of outcome assessor, patient, clinician or data analyst - see <LINK REF="REF-Devereaux-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Devereaux 2002</LINK>). The other three trials (<LINK REF="STD-Jensen-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Jensen 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Piaggessi-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Piaggessi 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vandeputte-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Vandeputte 1997</LINK>) did not appear to use blinded outcome assessments. <LINK REF="STD-Vandeputte-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Vandeputte 1997</LINK> photographed the wounds every four weeks although it was unclear if and how these photographs were used in the analysis. <LINK REF="STD-Whalley-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Whalley 2001</LINK> reported no information on blinding.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Incomplete outcome data</HEADING>
<P>Four of the six trials addressed loss to follow up. Two studies reported no withdrawals (<LINK REF="STD-Piaggessi-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Piaggessi 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vandeputte-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Vandeputte 1997</LINK>) and two studies accounted for the withdrawals which had taken place (<LINK REF="STD-D_x0027_Hemecourt-1998" TYPE="STUDY">D'Hemecourt 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jensen-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Jensen 1998</LINK>). This is important because excluding those people who withdrew from a study may lead to a misleading estimate of effectiveness as patients withdraw for non random reasons, including treatment failure.</P>
<P>An intention-to-treat analysis analyses participants in the groups to which they were randomised, irrespective of the treatment received. Three of the six trials (<LINK REF="STD-D_x0027_Hemecourt-1998" TYPE="STUDY">D'Hemecourt 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Markevich-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Markevich 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vandeputte-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Vandeputte 1997</LINK>) explicitly used an intention-to-treat analysis.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Selective reporting of outcomes</HEADING>
<P>Three of the included trials pre-specified study outcomes, all of which were reported (<LINK REF="STD-D_x0027_Hemecourt-1998" TYPE="STUDY">D'Hemecourt 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Piaggessi-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Piaggessi 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vandeputte-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Vandeputte 1997</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Jensen-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Jensen 1998</LINK> did not clearly pre-specify study outcomes nor did the two conference reports (<LINK REF="STD-Markevich-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Markevich 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Whalley-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Whalley 2001</LINK>). Therefore, selective reporting of outcomes was not discernible in these three trials.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Other bias</HEADING>
<P>It is essential that the trials involving diabetic foot ulcers ensure baseline comparability of the treatment groups for initial area of ulceration (see <LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-Margolis-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Margolis 1999</LINK> has demonstrated that baseline wound area is an important prognostic variable for foot ulcer healing. Trials involving diabetic foot ulcers (as with any other wound healing trials) often express the change in wound area as the percentage change, which takes into account the initial size of the wound, unlike the absolute change in area (<LINK REF="REF-Margolis-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Margolis 1999</LINK>). For two wounds healing at the same linear rate (as measured by diameter reduction), percentage area calculations will show a larger change for a smaller wound than a big wound. The converse is true when the absolute change in area is measured, since for any unit reduction in wound radius a bigger area reduction will occur for a larger wound (<LINK REF="REF-Bradley-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bradley 1999</LINK>). This has important consequences for the validity of trial results where there is poor comparability of wound size at baseline between the treatment groups. In large trials random allocation should ensure that the average wound size and variance in each group is similar. In a small trial random allocation is unlikely to result in an even distribution of wound sizes. In a trial where there is poor comparability between groups for wound size at baseline, and the outcome is based on the change in area, the result can only be considered valid if it is obtained either: against the anticipated direction of the bias for wound size, or where percentage area change and absolute area change are in the same direction. If baseline data are not given, then it is not possible to determine the direction of bias and the validity of the result cannot be determined.</P>
<P>Of the trials included, one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Markevich-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Markevich 2000</LINK>) demonstrated their treatment groups were balanced for ulcer area at baseline. <LINK REF="STD-D_x0027_Hemecourt-1998" TYPE="STUDY">D'Hemecourt 1998</LINK> reported that the ulcers in group treated with Becaplermin gel were different with respect to mean ulcer area, depth and duration of ulcer than were the ulcers in the other two groups (NaCMC gel comparator group and 'good wound care' control group); also sharp debridement was employed as deemed appropriate by the study investigator (see <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>). In the trial by <LINK REF="STD-Piaggessi-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Piaggessi 1998</LINK> the surgical debridement intervention group only were given antibiotics five days after surgery. In addition, one study (<LINK REF="STD-Jensen-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Jensen 1998</LINK>) was supported by an educational grant from the manufacturer of the hydrogel under assessment.</P>

<P>Results of dichotomous variables are presented as relative risk (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Relative risk has been used rather than odds ratios as the event rates are high in these trials and odds ratios would give an inflated impression of the magnitude of effect (<LINK REF="REF-Deeks-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deeks 1998</LINK>). Relative risk of healing is the healing rate in the experimental group divided by the healing rate in the control group.

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2009-11-03 16:54:21 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Debridement is practised as an intervention because clinicians believe that it promotes wound healing. It is because of this belief that an outcome measure based on wound healing is valid. The common outcome identified by all the trials was complete wound healing. Methods of debridement employed in the six included trials were surgical debridement, hydrogel and larval therapy. However, the confidence with which we can draw firm conclusions from this review is greatly tempered by:</P>
<OL>
<LI>the fact that the trials are at high risk of bias;</LI>
<LI>the diversity of the debriding agents being compared;</LI>
<LI>small sample sizes; and</LI>
<LI>lack of replication studies.</LI>
</OL>
<P>Most of the trials undertaken were small and under powered, running a risk of failing to detect clinically significant differences as statistically significant. Other common methodological flaws such as open randomisation, lack of baseline comparability and lack of blinded outcome assessment further reduce the confidence with which we can regard many of the individual study findings. It is possible to minimise bias in outcome assessment by having an assessor who is unaware of the treatment allocation, either in person, or by presenting photographic evidence of the ulcer. Future trials should address these deficiencies.</P>
<P>Firstly, debridement by surgical treatment compared with conventional non surgical management was considered by one small study (<LINK REF="STD-Piaggessi-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Piaggessi 1998</LINK>). Whilst the study authors concluded that surgical treatment of neuropathic foot ulcers in diabetic patients is more effective compared with conventional treatment, this conclusion was not based on a statistically significant effect and the study was low in power due to its small size. Therefore there is no evidence from RCTs that surgical debridement heals diabetic foot ulcers more rapidly than conservative care.</P>
<P>Secondly, the three trials comparing the effects of hydrogels with gauze or standard care were considered. These trials were generally at moderate to high risk of bias although the largest trial in the review (<LINK REF="STD-D_x0027_Hemecourt-1998" TYPE="STUDY">D'Hemecourt 1998</LINK>) (172 patients) did report using blinded outcome assessment. When these three trials (<LINK REF="STD-D_x0027_Hemecourt-1998" TYPE="STUDY">D'Hemecourt 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jensen-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Jensen 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vandeputte-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Vandeputte 1997</LINK>) were pooled, we demonstrated a statistically significant benefit for healing associated with hydrogel however confidence in this finding should be tempered by the risk of bias in the primary studies.</P>
<P>One trial (<LINK REF="STD-Whalley-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Whalley 2001</LINK>) compared two different hydrogels but reported only limited data and therefore the relative effectiveness of the different hydrogels is still unclear. </P>
<P>The comparison of larvae with hydrogel in 140 patients, is reported in abstract form only, and found no difference in complete wound healing between the two groups but did demonstrate a significant difference in the number of wounds that reduced in area of over 50% (<LINK REF="STD-Markevich-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Markevich 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>A trial by <LINK REF="STD-Steed-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Steed 1996</LINK>, which was excluded from the review on the grounds that it was not a randomised comparison of debridement strategies, raises some important issues. The trial makes a connection between debridement and an increased rate of wound healing. The trial was designed to assess the effects of topically applied growth factor with regard to the healing of diabetic foot ulcers. Before randomisation, all patients underwent aggressive, sharp debridement of callous and necrotic tissue. The influence of this debridement was evaluated by correlating healing rates with debridement. Whilst the results showed that, in general, there was a lower rate of healing in centres where less frequent debridement was performed, these results must be viewed with caution, as they constitute a post hoc analysis of a non-randomised comparison and it cannot be concluded that the only difference between the patients who healed was the extent of debridement received (<LINK REF="STD-Steed-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Steed 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>In summary, this review has demonstrated that hydrogel appears to result in better healing rates for diabetic foot ulcers than gauze or standard care. However, since hydrogel functions by increasing the moisture of the wound environment, it is not clear whether this effect is mediated through debridement per se. This review also demonstrated that larvae halved the wound area in just over 50% of the patients, but there is concern that the study data was reported at 10 days only in a trial of 30 months duration. More rigorous research is required to clarify whether debridement aids the healing of diabetic foot ulcers and if so which is the optimum method.</P>

<P>The RCTs on debridement of diabetic foot ulcers are in general small and of poor methodological quality. The evidence suggests that hydrogel increases the healing of diabetic foot ulcers compared with gauze or standard wound care. It is not clear whether this effect is due to debridement. The evidence also suggests that larvae achieve a reduction in wound area.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2009-11-03 23:04:38 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Well-designed RCTs of sufficient size and with a long enough duration of follow up are needed to assess the effectiveness of debridement of diabetic foot ulcers. Future trials evaluating debridement need to be properly randomised with concealed allocation, adequate sample size, blinding of outcome assessors, unbiased, and objective in their assessment of ulcer healing. The review strongly suggests that more good quality RCTs are needed to determine the clinical effect of debridement on healing.</P>

<P>Feedback submitted by Ronald Sherman - as follows:<BR/>My concerns center around the inclusion of Markevich's study of maggot therapy for debriding diabetic foot ulcers, which really does not belong in a Cochrane review claiming to examine the effect of diabetic foot ulcer debridement on wound healing.</P>
<P>Let us closely examine Markevich's study and the misleading or inaccurate statements in Edwards' review:</P>
<P>Point 1:<BR/>Most egregious is the suggestion that Markevich's study was designed to investigate the effect of maggot therapy on wound healing. Markewich's paper clearly describes the study period as being only 10 days. No wound care professional would seriously believe that a 10-day study was designed to measure wound closure. For this reason alone it does not belong in this review of "wound healing after debridement" studies. All other studies in this analysis clearly measured healing after 10-26 weeks, as a specific study endpoint.  It is inappropriate and irresponsible for Edwards to point to Markevich's 10-day study as evidence that maggot debridement results in "no statistically significant difference" in the proportion of ulcers completely healed.</P>
<P>Point 2:<BR/>What does Edwards have to say about the outcomes which Markevich's study was designed to measure? What does Edwards' review state about Markewich's primary results? Markewich's primary results were that, within 10 days, 60% of maggot-treated wounds were debrided and at least 50% covered by granulation tissue, vs 33.4% of control wounds (p &lt; 0.001). Also by day 10, 51% of the maggot-treated wounds had decreased in size by at least 50%, compared to only 27% of the control wounds (p &lt; 0.05). Edwards mentions nothing about these primary findings. In the detailed review of all other studies included in Edwards' paper, primary and secondary outcomes are discussed under headings so labelled. But in the discussion of Markewich's study, Edwards omitted a "primary outcomes" heading, and avoided any mention of the primary outcome measures altogether. The only finding for this study that was mentioned was that 5/70 (7%) maggot-treated wounds healed, vs 2 of 70 (3%) control wounds; and that this was not a significant difference. The impression is that this is the primary outcome measure; the primary result of the Markevich's study. This is not just my impression, but the interpretation of other authors who have since cited Edwards' paper as the source for their incorrect statement that failure to improve wound healing was the primary outcome of Markevich's study. What does Edwards have to say about the fact that this measurement was on day 10?  Edwards states that "it is unclear from the abstract how long it took to achieve wound healing." It is very clear to me that the assessment of wound healing was made at day 10, as were the other findings in the report (despite the fact that English is not the primary language of the study's author). But if the results were "not clear" to me, I certainly would not have included Markevich's study abstract (the full study has never been published) in a review about wound healing, in which every other study clearly measured healing endpoints at 10-26 weeks!</P>
<P>Point 3:<BR/>What are some other examples of inappropriately strong and erroneous statements? As I have noted, Markevich's study demonstrated the efficacy of maggot therapy for debridement, if not wound healing. Other controlled clinical studies published after 2000 have similarly demonstrated the efficacy and safety of maggot therapy for debridement of diabetic foot ulcers (Sherman, 2003), pressure ulcers (Sherman, 2002), venous stasis ulcers (Wayman et al, 2000) and other foot and leg wounds. Yet, Edwards states in <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK> ("Methods of Debridement") that one of the disadvantages of maggot therapy is that  "there is at present no conclusive evidence of [debridement] effectiveness in foot ulcers." That conclusion was not well founded in 2002, and clearly is not defendable now.</P>
<P>Point 4:<BR/>In the abstract (Main Results), Edwards states that "Surgical debridement and larval therapy showed no significant benefit over standard treatment and hydrogel respectively in these small trials."  Again, this study of larval therapy (here described as "small," but in fact one of the largest studies in Edward's review) DID show significant benefit over standard treatment as a method of debridement. Concluding that this 10-day study demonstrates no benefit in wound closure rate from maggot therapy is a serious misinterpretation of Markevich's study.</P>

<P>Reply from Jude Edwards, review author - as follows:<BR/>
</P>
<P>Thank you for your comment which we have considered carefully, please find below our point by point responses to the issues raised:</P>
<P>The Cochrane review,  &#8216;Debridement of diabetic foot ulcers&#8217;, follows the principles of all Cochrane systematic reviews in that it aims to provide a summary of the best available evidence. Cochrane reviews include data from randomised controlled trials; when properly randomised, they do not suffer from selection bias and so provide the best estimates of treatment effects. </P>
<P>Point 1:<BR/>Firstly, the primary study authors&#8217; objectives for the primary study are largely irrelevant when conducting a systematic review, provided the primary study meets all the pre-specified eligibility criteria. In other words, original authors&#8217; study objectives do not contribute to eligibility or selection decisions. We cannot from the abstract judge quite what the objective was in the Markevich study but since they randomised a debriding agent and measured wound healing in people with diabetic foot ulcers, we are happy to include it in this review. The eligibility criteria for this review, which were pre-specified in the protocol before the review was conducted, stated that studies which measured the rate of change of wound size were eligible for inclusion, not just studies which measured time to complete healing. By these prespecified criteria, the Markevich study should be included, though we agree, 10 days is insufficient time to observe complete wound healing.</P>
<P>Point 2:<BR/>We are extremely grateful to you for bringing to our attention the omission of the healing rate data from the review. This was an accidental oversight which we have now corrected in the updated review. It is correct, however, that the review also presents the complete healing findings as this was also prespecified in the protocol.</P>
<P>Point 3: <BR/>This review has recently been updated and the comprehensive searches are current to June 2009.  We identified no other RCTs of larval therapy for diabetic foot ulcer, and we have a policy of not including quasi randomised or non-randomised controlled studies in the presence of RCTs since they are far more susceptible to selection bias. We cannot include trials that relate to other types of wounds in a review of treatments for diabetic foot ulcers however another Cochrane review is considering the same question in people with venous leg ulcers<B>.</B>
</P>
<P>Point 4: <BR/>We have amended the abstract, results and conclusions of the review to reflect the inclusion of the data on reduction in wound area.</P>
<P>Thank you for your observations which have undoubtedly helped improve the quality of this review.</P>

<P>Comments from: Dr Heike Heuer on the consideration to include recently published trials (VenUS I and VenUS II). In addition the consistency in the conclusions regarding the strength of evidence contributed by the Markevich trail in the abstract compared with the text of the review. As follows:</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Initial comment from: Dr Heike Heuer</HEADING>
<P>We have seen your papers on maggot therapy (leg ulcers), published last year and we were, as everybody using medicinal larvae, surprised on the results you published. Even though, we are strong followers of evidence based medical treatments and your work gives evidence. Although and as many others we hoped to have more evidence for wound healing, we accept the finding on evidence for debridement only.<BR/> <BR/>Today we found the review cited in the title of Dr. Edwards and Dr. Stapley (foot ulcer). This review claims to up-to-date to October  2009. As you may see in the mail we foreward to your hands, we are somewhat surprise since we read it.<BR/> <BR/>To have reliable information available is most important for any therapy including maggot therapy. Do you believe that there is a significant difference between leg and foot ulcers regarding maggot therapy. In this case we are wondering why Dr. Edwards did not even mention the results published by VenUS I and VenUS II, as these give evidence where the study of <LINK REF="STD-Markevich-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Markevich 2000</LINK> is judged by Edwards as unclear in all points of possible bias. In<BR/>addition Edwards wrote that Markevich could not even be contacted for further questions.<BR/> <BR/> As the full paper costs the reader about $ 30, most interested readers will read only the free abstract. In that abstract the authors` conclusion is: ... and larval therapy resulted in significantly greater reduction in wound area than hydrogel.<BR/>Could you pls. commend and help us understanding this confusion.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Further response from Dr Heike Heuer</HEADING>
<P>Thank you very much for your answer and your kind mail. I do accept when foot and leg is argued to be different populations of diabetic ulcers. Although I believe, that with regards to debriding both will behave more or less similar.<BR/> <BR/>As there are no new facts from studies on maggot debridement of diabetic foot ulcers, the results of Markevich (2000) are summed up to a different conclusion. The study of Markevich is marked with lots of possible bias in the full text but very much optimistic in the abstract. In fact, the major different in the first and in the last COCHRANE is only one RTC study on hydrogels. There are no new data on maggots available but a different view on these (in the abstract).<BR/>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Response to initial comment from the Cochrane Wounds Group Managing Editor:  Sally Bell-Syer</HEADING>
<P>The Cochrane review you have cited by  Edwards J, Stapley S. Debridement of diabetic foot ulcers, is indeed recently updated and aims to assess the effects of debridement interventions on the healing of  foot ulcers in people with diabetes.  The population of interest for this review are people with diabetes who have a foot ulcer and the study you refer to - Markevich (2000) - states that they included people with diabetic neuropathic foot lesions.</P>
<P>In addition you have highlighted two recent papers published in the BMJ which report on a randomised controlled trial which compared the clinical effectiveness of larval therapy with a standard debridement technique (hydrogel) for sloughy or necrotic leg ulcers. The participants eligible for inclusion in this trial had venous or mixed venous and arterial leg ulcers.</P>
<P>Essentially these are two different populations. The review by Edwards would not consider the RCT conducted in people with venous leg ulcers as eligible for inclusion as their population of interest is people with diabetes who have a foot ulcer. However you may be interested to know that there is an ongoing Cochrane review of 'Debridement for venous leg ulcers' which is at draft protocol stage and this review will consider the RCT by Dumville et al which has participants with venous leg ulcers.</P>
<P>I hope this explain how the Cochrane reviews are dealing with these two distinct populations. If you have any further queries please let me know.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Further response from the Cochrane Wounds Group Managing Editor:  Sally Bell-Syer</HEADING>
<P>Thank you for your response and further comments of clarification.<BR/>
<BR/>As you are aware the Markevich study is in abstract form only and whilst we have contacted the author in an effort to obtain a full trial report and more information we have received no reply. You quite correctly point out that the message given in the abstract "One small trial<BR/>suggested that larvae resulted in a more than 50% reduction in wound area compared with hydrogel" is more positive than the message given by the results presented in the text of the review.<BR/>
<BR/>We are very grateful that you have taken the time to contact us and we will now revisit the abstract of this review and revise the text to ensure that the message is more in line with the results that were available to the review authors and are presented in the text of the review.<BR/>
<BR/>This feedback is very important to us, whilst we do spend a great deal of time in an effort to ensure that all aspects of the review are accurate and consistent the observations and comments of our peers are valuable. Thank you for taking the time to contact us and we will amend the review in time for the next submission to the Cochrane Library.<BR/>
