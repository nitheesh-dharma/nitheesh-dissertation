<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2013-10-30 09:28:10 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Acute diarrhoea, typically due to bacterial or viral infection, is a common childhood illness and, in low-income countries, remains an important cause of death. Over two million children under five years of age die each year in poorer countries because of acute diarrhoea. In richer countries, it does not usually cause death but it is a common reason for young children needing medical advice or hospital admission.</P>
<P>Young children with acute diarrhoea may temporarily be unable to digest lactose, the most common type of sugar in milk. Inability to digest and absorb lactose can make the diarrhoea worse and last longer. We looked for evidence that reducing children's lactose intake, either by feeding lactose-free milk or by diluting lactose-containing milk, shortens the duration of diarrhoea and prevents complications such as dehydration.</P>
<P>We looked for research up to 13 May 2013 and included 33 trials in our analyses. Twenty-two trials compared outcomes for children given a lactose-free feed with those for children given a lactose-containing feed and 11 trials compared outcomes for children fed a diluted milk feed with those for children given an undiluted milk feed.</P>
<P>We found evidence that feeds that do not contain lactose may reduce the duration of diarrhoea by an average of about 18 hours (<I>low quality evidence</I>). Lactose-free feeds probably lower the risk of children having prolonged or worsening diarrhoea (<I>moderate quality evidence</I>).</P>
<P>We did not find any evidence that diluted milk feeds reduce the duration of diarrhoea (<I>low quality evidence</I>) but these feeds may lower the risk of children having prolonged or worsening diarrhoea (<I>low quality evidence</I>).</P>
<P>The majority of trials excluded breast fed infants, and none were conducted in low-income countries where diarrhoea can cause death, so the review is relevant to infants and young children who are receiving formula or are weaned in high- and middle-income countries.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2013-10-22 17:09:54 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Young children with acute diarrhoea, typically due to infectious gastroenteritis, may temporarily stop producing lactase, the intestinal enzyme that digests lactose. This means they may not digest lactose, the main sugar in milk, and this may worsen or prolong the diarrhoeal illness. However, there is uncertainty whether avoiding lactose-containing milk or milk products helps young children recover from acute diarrhoea more quickly.</P>

<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2013-10-22 17:10:49 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>To assess if avoiding or reducing intake of lactose-containing milk or milk products shortens the duration and severity of illness in young children with acute diarrhoea. We also sought other indicators of morbidity and overall mortality. </P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2013-10-30 13:34:54 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register (14 May 2013), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) published in <I>The Cochrane Library</I> (Issue 4, 2013), MEDLINE (1996 to 14 May 2013), EMBASE (1974 to 14 May 2013), and LILACS (1982 to 14 May 2013), and the reference lists of potentially relevant trials, key conference proceedings, and wrote to individuals and organizations in the field.</P>

<P>Randomized or quasi-randomized controlled trials that assessed the effects of avoiding or reducing exposure to lactose in young children under five years with acute diarrhoea.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2013-10-22 17:03:04 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We extracted data using the standard methods of the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group, and two review authors independently evaluated trial quality and data extraction. Continuous outcomes were compared using mean difference (MD), and dichotomous outcomes using the risk ratio (RR). We presented all results with 95% confidence intervals (CI) and assessed the quality of evidence using the GRADE approach.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-10-30 09:01:29 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included 33 trials enrolling 2973 children with acute diarrhoea. Twenty-nine trials were exclusively conducted on inpatients, all from high- or middle-income countries. Fifteen trials included children aged below 12 months, and 22 excluded children who were being breast-fed.</P>
<P>Compared to lactose-containing milk, milk products, or foodstuffs, lactose-free products may reduce the duration of diarrhoea by an average of about 18 hours (MD -17.77, 95% CI -25.32 to -10.21, 16 trials, 1467 participants, <I>low quality evidence</I>). Lactose-free products probably also reduce treatment failure (defined variously as continued or worsening diarrhoea or vomiting, the need for additional rehydration therapy, or continuing weight loss) by around a half (RR 0.52, 95% CI 0.39 to 0.68, 18 trials, 1470 participants, <I>moderate quality evidence</I>).</P>
<P>Diluted lactose-containing milk has not been shown to reduce the duration of diarrhoea compared to undiluted milk or milk products (five trials, 417 participants, <I>low quality evidence</I>), but may reduce the risk of treatment failure (RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.94, nine trials, 687 participants, <I>low quality evidence</I>).</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2013-10-30 09:02:24 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In young children with acute diarrhoea who are not predominantly breast-fed, change to a lactose-free diet may result in earlier resolution of acute diarrhoea and reduce treatment failure. Diluting lactose-containing formulas may also have some benefits but further trials are required to have confidence in this finding. There are no trials from low-income countries, where mortality for diarrhoea is high, and malnutrition is more common.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2013-10-23 14:26:44 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2013-10-23 14:26:44 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Acute diarrhoea, most commonly due to infectious gastroenteritis, is common throughout the world. In high-income countries, acute diarrhoea is a common reason for primary care consultation and hospital referral. In the United Kingdom, up to one in six children each year see their general practitioner because of an episode of acute diarrhoea (<LINK REF="REF-Djuretic-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Djuretic 1999</LINK>). About 5% to 10% of hospital admissions of young children are for acute diarrhoeal illnesses (<LINK REF="REF-Armon-2001a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Armon 2001a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Malek-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Malek 2006</LINK>). In developing countries, infectious gastroenteritis is a common cause of morbidity and death in young children (<LINK REF="REF-Black-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Black 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Santosham-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Santosham 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>Transient deficiency of lactase, the enzyme present in the upper small intestine that digests lactose, may occur following acute diarrhoea (<LINK REF="REF-Sunshine-1964" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sunshine 1964</LINK>). Lactose is the most abundant sugar in animal milk, including human breast milk, and in adapted cow's milk formulas. If young children are unable to digest and absorb lactose because of lactase deficiency then continuing to ingest lactose-containing milk or milk products may worsen acute diarrhoea because of osmotic effects. This may exacerbate dehydration, malabsorption, malnutrition, and growth failure, and ultimately may contribute to child deaths in areas of the world where severe diarrhoeal illness is common.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2013-10-23 09:56:23 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Due to these potential adverse consequences of lactase deficiency, some practitioners advise reduced exposure of young children with acute diarrhoea to lactose-containing milk and milk products. As an alternative, children may be fed with lactose-free milk (for example, soy-based milk), milk with a reduced lactose content (for example, hydrolysed or lactase-treated cow's milk formula), or non-milk-based foodstuffs. Lactose exposure may also be reduced by diluting lactose-containing milk. However, lactose-free or lactose-reduced formula is not always available or affordable, especially in low-income settings. Feeding young children with diluted milk may reduce the intake of energy, protein, and other nutrients, and may have an adverse impact on illness recovery and growth, especially in infants for whom milk is the principal source of nutrients. If breastfeeding is interrupted because of a diarrhoeal illness then it may be difficult to re-establish after recovery, thus removing the advantages of breastfeeding for the mother and child.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2013-10-22 17:03:05 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Clinical guidelines based on literature evaluation and expert consensus offer conflicting advice regarding whether lactose avoidance should be advised for young children with acute diarrhoea (<LINK REF="REF-AAP-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">AAP 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Murphy-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Murphy 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Armon-2001b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Armon 2001b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-AAP-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">AAP 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Dalby_x002d_Payne-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dalby-Payne 2011</LINK>). A systematic review published in 1994 found some evidence that lactose avoidance improved important clinical outcomes for young children with acute diarrhoea, especially for children who were severely dehydrated as a consequence of the acute diarrhoeal illness (<LINK REF="REF-Brown-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brown 1994</LINK>). Several relevant randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have since been published. Furthermore, the review did not include any trials found by handsearching journals not covered by the electronic databases and did not attempt to find unpublished trials. There is a risk that important evidence may be missing because of publication bias.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-10-23 12:28:17 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included 33 trials (from 32 reports), enrolling 2973 children. Trials varied regarding the age of participants, the income of the country where the trial took place, and the types of interventions. Most participants were inpatients rather than outpatients.</P>
<P>None of the included trials reported mortality as an outcome.</P>
<P>Compared to lactose-containing milk, milk products, or foodstuffs, lactose-free products may reduce the duration of diarrhoea by about18 hours (MD -17.77, 95% CI -25.32 to -10.21, 16 trials, 1467 participants, <I>low quality evidence</I>). Lactose-free products probably also reduce the risk of treatment failure (typically defined as continued or worsening diarrhoea or vomiting, the need for additional rehydration therapy, or on-going weight loss) by around a half (RR 0.52, 95% CI 0.39 to 0.68), 18 trials, 1470 participants, <I>moderate quality evidence</I>).</P>
<P>Diluted lactose-containing milk has not been shown to reduce the duration of diarrhoea compared to undiluted milk or milk products (MD -2.01 hours, 95% CI -9.71 to 5.68, five trials, 471 participants, <I>low quality evidence</I>), but may reduce the risk of treatment failure by around a third (RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.94, nine trials, 687 participants, <I>low quality evidence</I>).</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2013-10-23 13:00:51 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The included trials come from a variety of inpatient settings in high-, middle-, and low-income countries. Notably, only one trial was conducted in sub-Saharan Africa.</P>
<P>Mortality, one of our primary outcomes given the high mortality from acute diarrhoea in low- and middle-income countries, was not reported by any of the trials. This is probably due to most trials limiting inclusion to clinically stable infants, and excluding those at higher risk of death (those severely dehydrated or malnourished).</P>
<P>Also, most trials specifically excluded breast-fed infants from participation, and consequently the findings of this review cannot be applied to this group. A consensus view prevails that any disadvantage related to continued lactose exposure from breastfeeding during diarrhoeal illness is likely to be outweighed by the immunological, anti-infective and nutritional benefits of breast milk. In addition, there are concerns that interruption of breastfeeding during an acute diarrhoeal illness may lead to cessation of breastfeeding completely, so it is generally not advised.</P>
<P>Most trials were conducted in secondary or referral healthcare settings, predominantly hospital inpatient wards, and may not be directly applicable to the community or primary care settings where most diarrhoea is treated. However, in general the level of illness severity of most participants in these trials was similar to that of children who could be safely cared for at home. Most trials did not recruit severely malnourished or dehydrated infants or children. The available trial data, however, do not provide adequate evidence to evaluate any effect of the interventions on the need for consequent hospital admission.</P>
<P>Most trials reported that rotavirus infection was the most commonly identified cause of acute diarrhoea in trial participants. Given plans to implement a rotavirus vaccination programme in many countries over the next few years, the infectious epidemiology of acute diarrhoea is likely to change. It is uncertain how applicable the evidence from this review will be when rotavirus is no longer the commonest infectious agent, especially since rotavirus infection may be more strongly associated with transient lactase deficiency than other, particularly bacterial, causes of infectious gastroenteritis (<LINK REF="REF-Saavedra-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Saavedra 1989</LINK>).</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2013-10-23 12:30:50 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We assessed the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach and presented the basis for the judgements in two summary of findings tables (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>; <LINK REF="SOF-02" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 2</LINK>).</P>
<P>The evidence that lactose-free milk or milk products reduces the duration of diarrhoea is of low quality, meaning we can have only limited confidence in this result. The evidence was downgraded due to the high level of heterogeneity in the magnitude of the observed effect that was not adequately explained by pre-specified subgroup analyses and because many of the included trials were at unclear or high risk of bias. However, we also noted that the result remained statistically significant in sensitivity analyses where only the trials at low risk of bias were included. The funnel plot contained some minor asymmetry but this was not considered substantial enough to downgrade for risk of publication bias. The evidence for a reduction in treatment failure is of moderate quality, meaning we can have reasonable confidence in this result.</P>
<P>Of note, a post-hoc subgroup analysis suggested that the unexplained heterogeneity may be due to differences in the types of interventions. In some trials, the comparisons differed not only regarding lactose content of the formula but also in other aspects of the diet. Mostly, these were comparisons of soy-based with cow's milk-based formulas. Some trials also compared mixed diets (cereals, rice, vegetable oils) with or without milk, milk products, or foodstuffs. A subgroup analysis restricted to those trials which compared the same formula, with or without lactose, found a reduction in diarrhoea duration of around 20 hours with no statistical heterogeneity.</P>
<P>Evidence for the effect of diluted lactose-containing products on diarrhoea duration was of low quality due to concerns about the risk of bias of the included trials (with only one trial taking adequate steps to reduce the risk of selection bias, and only two trials conducting any blinding), and imprecision of the result with very wide CIs. The evidence for a reduction in treatment failure was of moderate quality, again downgraded due to concerns about the risk of bias of the included trials.</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2013-10-22 17:30:33 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The main concern with the review process is the possibility that the findings are subject to publication and other reporting biases, including better availability of numerical data for inclusion in meta-analyses from trials which reported statistically significant or clinically important effects (<LINK REF="REF-Hopewell-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hopewell 2009</LINK>). We attempted to minimize this threat by searching the proceedings of the major international conferences to identify trial reports that are not (or not yet) published in full form in academic journals. We cannot be sure that other trials have been undertaken but not reported, thus the concern remains that such trials are less likely than published trials to have detected statistically significant or clinically important effects.</P>
<P>We were not able to obtain the full text of two reports that were cited in a previous systematic review (<LINK REF="REF-Brown-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brown 1994</LINK>), despite seeking them via the British Library international search facility (<LINK REF="STD-Chiriboga-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Chiriboga 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Madkour-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Madkour 1986</LINK>). In the previous review, these reports were described as RCTs of diluted versus undiluted milk for young children with acute diarrhoea. Neither found a statistically significant effect on the duration of diarrhoea. If we obtain these articles, we will assess them for eligibility for inclusion in an update of this review.</P>

<P>The available evidence indicates that for young children who are predominantly bottle-fed or weaned, a change to a lactose-free diet probably results in earlier resolution of acute diarrhoea. Applicability of these findings to community-settings is uncertain as most participants in the included trials were inpatients. Alternatively, diluting lactose-containing formulas may have some benefits but further trials are necessary to have confidence in this finding.</P>

<P>We did not perform the planned subgroup analysis of trials that included participants who were moderately or severely malnourished because this participant characteristic was not consistently reported or described (in standard way). Instead, we undertook subgroup analyses by income level of country (low- or middle-income versus high-income countries). </P>
<P>An additional post-hoc subgroup analysis (suggested by external referee, not stated in the protocol) was conducted, which was identified clearly as a post-hoc analysis.</P>

<SUP>2</SUP> Downgraded by 1 for serious inconsistency: A high level of heterogeneity between trials was found which could not be fully explained through subgroup analyses by age, setting, or income level of the country.<BR/>
<SUP>3</SUP> No serious indirectness: The included trials were mainly conducted in inpatient settings, but came from a mix of high- and low-income countries. Subgroup analyses did not find any significant differences in estimate size based on age, setting, income level of the country, or differences in feed type apart from the lactose content.<BR/>
<SUP>4 </SUP>No serious imprecision: The result is a statistically significant effect in favour of lactose-free, with a narrow CI.<BR/>
<SUP>5</SUP> Downgraded by 1 for serious risk of bias: Many of the trials were at high or unclear risk of selection, performance, and attrition bias. In a sensitivity analysis limited to the three trials at low risk of selection bias, no statistically significant effect was seen.<BR/>
<SUP>6 </SUP>No serious inconsistency: Statistical heterogeneity was low.<BR/>
<SUP>7</SUP> Downgraded by 1 for serious indirectness: Only a single trial from a single setting evaluated this outcome.<BR/>
<SUP>8 </SUP>Downgraded by 2 for very serious imprecision: There were few participants and few events. The CIs were very wide for this outcome and the 95% CIs around the pooled effect estimate included both significant benefit and harm of intervention.<BR/>
