<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2011-02-28 14:39:24 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Gail Quinn">
<P>In women with locally advanced vulval cancer (vulval cancer extending to urethra, vagina, perineum, anus, bladder, rectum, fixed to bones and enlarged fixed lymph glands) there was no significant difference in overall survival or treatment-related adverse events when primary chemoradiation or neoadjuvant chemoradiation (chemoradiation followed by less radical surgery) were compared with primary surgery. Women requiring extensive surgery (urinary and or feacal stoma formation) or with inoperable tumour were predominantly given primary chemoradiation in the two retrospective studies identified, making the available evidence weak (although we only included studies that used statistical adjustment). There was no data on quality of life. There is a great need for good quality studies comparing various primary treatments in locally advanced vulval cancer which are either inoperable at presentation or operable but would require extensive surgery.</P>

<P>Vulval cancer is a rare gynaecological cancer. There is no standard approach for treating locally advanced primary vulval cancer (FIGO stage III and IV). Combined treatment modalities have been developed using radiotherapy, chemotherapy and surgery. The advantages and disadvantages of such treatment is not well evaluated.</P>

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2010-11-26 23:47:31 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (<I>The Cochrane Library</I> 2009, Issue 3), Cochrane Gynaecological Cancer Group Trials Register, MEDLINE and EMBASE (to July 2009). We also searched registers of clinical trials, abstracts of scientific meetings, reference lists of included studies and contacted experts in the field.</P>

<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2010-11-26 23:48:22 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two review authors independently abstracted data and assessed risk of bias. An adjusted hazard ratio (HR) for overall survival was calculated for one non-randomised study and risk ratios (RRs) were used in an RCT to compare five-year death rates and adverse events in women who received neoadjuvant, primary chemoradiation or primary surgery. Adverse events were also reported more extensively in a further non-randomised study. All results were displayed in single study analyses.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2011-02-28 14:42:03 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Gail Quinn">
<P>One RCT and two non-randomised studies that allowed for multivariate analyses met the inclusion criteria and included a total of 141 women.</P>
<P>One RCT found that neoadjuvant chemoradiation did not appear to offer longer survival compared to primary surgery in advanced vulval tumours (RR = 1.29, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.87 to 1.91). There was also no statistically significant difference in survival between primary chemoradiation and primary surgery in a study that included 63 women (pooled adjusted HR= 1.09, 95% CI 0.37 to 3.17) and in another study that only included 12 eligible women and compared the same interventions (HR was non-informative when statistical adjustment was made).</P>
<P>Adverse events were extensively reported in only one study, which found no statistically significant difference in risk of adverse events between primary chemoradiation and primary surgery due to the very small numbers in each group. In the RCT there was no observed statistically significant difference between neoadjuvant chemoradiation and primary surgery. Adverse events were not reported in the largest study of 63 women. Quality of life (QoL) was not reported in any of the included studies. All studies were at high risk of bias.

<P>Women with advanced vulval tumours showed no significant difference in overall survival or treatment-related adverse events when chemoradiation (primary or neoadjuvant) was compared with primary surgery.</P>
<P>The retrospective studies had a high risk of bias as the entry criteria for primary chemoradiation was based on inoperability or tumour requiring exenteration.The radiochemotherapy regimens varied widely. There was no data on QoL.</P>
<P>There is no standard terminology for 'operable and inoperable vulval cancer', and for 'primary and neoadjuvant chemoradiation'. Stratification according to unresectability of the primary tumour and/or lymph nodes is needed, for good quality comparison.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2011-02-28 14:40:23 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Gail Quinn">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2011-02-15 11:35:55 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Vulval cancer is predominantly a disease of elderly women, with a mean age at diagnosis of approximately 70 years (<LINK REF="REF-Jemal-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jemal 2006</LINK>). According to population-based studies, about 75% of vulval malignancies are squamous cell carcinomas (<LINK REF="REF-Platz-95" TYPE="REFERENCE">Platz 95</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Velden-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Velden 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stroup-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stroup 2008</LINK>). In advanced stage vulval cancer (FIGO stage III and IV) there can be extension of the vulval tumour to the adjacent genitourinary system and anorectum, and fixity to bones with or without enlarged fixed pelvic or groin lymph nodes. Thirty to forty per cent of squamous carcinoma of the vulva are in advanced stages at presentation. Treatment in these cases is individualised.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2011-02-28 14:40:23 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Gail Quinn">
<P>In women presenting with locally advanced tumour, treatment ranges from radical vulvectomy and bilateral inguinofemoral lymphadenectomy with or without partial resection of urethra, vagina or anus to exenteration. This is followed by adjuvant radiotherapy or chemoradiotherapy depending on the residual disease or risk of recurrence. Plastic reconstruction procedures are considered following excision of large vulval tumours (see <LINK TAG="CRIT_INTERVENTIONS" TYPE="SECTION">Types of interventions</LINK> for detailed description of surgical procedures).</P>
<P>For women presenting with locally advanced inoperable tumours, chemoradiation followed by no surgery or less radical surgery is generally advocated (see <LINK TAG="CRIT_INTERVENTIONS" TYPE="SECTION">Types of interventions</LINK> for description of types of chemoradiation). In the 1980s, both <LINK REF="REF-Boronow-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boronow 1982</LINK> and <LINK REF="REF-Hacker-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hacker 1984</LINK> presented the results on neoadjuvant radiation therapy in vulval cancer. The results were promising as pelvic exenteration did not appear to be necessary and survival was excellent. In the same time period chemoradiation was developed for anal cancer (<LINK REF="REF-Cummings-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cummings 1984</LINK>). In view of the promising results, various treatment modalities such as chemoradiation alone, neoadjuvant chemoradiation followed by less extensive surgery or surgery followed by adjuvant postoperative radiation or chemoradiation have been developed in this group of women (<LINK REF="REF-Gaffney-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gaffney 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Landoni-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Landoni 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>All types of treatment are associated with high morbidity, treatment-related deaths and varying but unsatisfactory overall survival rates. In particular, women undergoing exenterative procedure have higher surgical complication rates, including a mortality of 2% to10% (<LINK REF="REF-Maggioni-A-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maggioni A 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moore-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Moore 1998</LINK>). Such radical surgery is often inappropriate for the elderly due to severe psychological and physical morbidity (<LINK REF="REF-Andersen-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Andersen 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moore-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Moore 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Maggioni-A-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maggioni A 2009</LINK>). Even though the incidence of vulval cancer is lower in the younger age group, such surgery is also inappropriate for young women as it causes severe psychosexual problems (<LINK REF="STD-Gadducci-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Gadducci 2006</LINK>). Chemoradiation is often associated with extensive desquamation of vulval skin leading to treatment breaks, and is also associated with long term side effects of chemoradiation. There is mortality associated with chemoradiation as well.</P>
<P>There are few studies on the effectiveness of neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by surgery in this group of women (<LINK REF="STD-Benedetti_x002d_Panici--1993" TYPE="STUDY">Benedetti-Panici 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Geisler-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Geisler 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wagenaar-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Wagenaar 2001</LINK>) and they have varying results.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2011-02-28 14:40:23 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Gail Quinn">
<P>Traditionally, primary vulval cancers have been managed by radical surgery followed by adjuvant radiation or chemoradiation (<LINK REF="REF-Ansink-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ansink 1999</LINK>). Inoperable tumours at initial presentation are treated with chemoradiation. Inoperability in advanced vulval cancer is determined based on the extent of local tumour and or the extent and fixity of nodal disease. The combination of clinical presentations makes comparison between surgery and radiation or chemoradiation in locally advanced vulval disease difficult. The decision to move away from standard management (e.g. primary surgery where possible) in advanced vulval disease is driven by the need to reduce the mortality and morbidity associated with extensive surgery, especially in elderly patients. Extensive surgery also affects the quality of life for younger patients, in terms of body image and psychosexual morbidity. The use of neoadjuvant chemoradiation in vulval cancer stems from the positive influence of this modality of treatment in anal cancer. On the contrary, in locally advanced cervical cancer combined treatment (surgery and chemoradiation) is generally not advised as it causes more adverse effects than single treatment. However the management of advanced vulval cancer is heterogenous and individualised.</P>
<P>The efficacy and safety of alternative treatment in advanced vulval cancer is mostly based on good quality feasibility studies, case series and case reports with no comparisons. Chemoradiation is also associated with treatment-related morbidity and mortality. The indications and optimal regime for this treatment have not been completely evaluated. A recent survey from the Gynecologic Cancer Intergroup study on patterns of care for radiation and chemotherapy in vulval cancer confirms the fact that there is a difference in the indications for treatment, treatment fields and use of chemotherapy among various members of the Gynecologic Cancer Intergroup, even though the doses of radiation were similar among the members (<LINK REF="REF-Gaffney-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gaffney 2009</LINK>). Hence we aimed to search for good quality comparative studies in this review.</P>

<P>Studies regarding patients with histologically proven, locally advanced primary squamous cell carcinoma of the vulva were considered for this review. It was anticipated that only a very small number, if any, randomised controlled trials (RCTs) would have been conducted on chemoradiation treatment in vulval cancer. We therefore also considered non-randomised studies with concurrent comparison groups:</P>
<UL>
<LI>quasi-randomised trials, non-randomised trials, prospective and retrospective comparative cohort studies, and case series of 10 or more patients that allowed concurrent comparisons of chemoradiation with different treatments.</LI>
</UL>
<P>Case-control studies, uncontrolled observational studies and case series of fewer than 10 patients were excluded.</P>
<P>In order to minimise selection bias, we decided to include only studies that used statistical adjustment for baseline case mix using multivariable analyses (for example age, performance status, grade) if any constraints were placed on treatment allocation (for example women with poor performance status would not be given chemoradiation or surgery, women who needed exenterative surgery would be allocated to primary chemoradiation treatment (CRT) rather than primary surgery), or treatment was based on clinician preference.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Surgery</HEADING>
<P>Radical local excision of vulva: excision of the tumour carried down to the fascia lata with a circumferential tumour-free margin of at least one centimetre.</P>
<P>Vulvectomy (radical, simple, modified, hemi): radical vulvectomy is defined as excision of the complete vulval skin and subcutaneous tissue down to the fascia lata. Simple and modified vulvectomy is similar but with preservation of varying amounts of vulval skin and subcutaneous tissue. Hemivulvectomy is removal of vulval skin and subcutaneous tissue down to the fascia lata on the affected side. The purpose of the modifications is to achieve a tumour-free margin of at least one centimetre with preservation of some vulval tissue.</P>
<P>Lymphadenectomy (inguinofemoral or deep, inguinal or superficial, ipsilateral, pelvic): inguino femoral lymphadenectomy is defined as removal of all inguinal and femoral lymph nodes. It is achieved by removing lymph nodes bearing fatty tissue between the inguinal ligament, the sartorius muscle and the adductor longus muscle, as well as dissection of the femoral lymph nodes located in the fossa ovalis medial to the femoral vein. Inguinal lymphadenectomy is defined as removal of all lymph node bearing fatty tissue between the inguinal ligament, the sartorius muscle and the adductor longus muscle above the level of the fascia lata. Ipsilateral lymphadenectomy is removal of inguinofemoral lymph nodes on the side of the tumour. Pelvic lymphadenectomy is removal of iliac and obturator lymph nodes in the pelvis.</P>
<P>Exenteration (anterior, posterior, total): total pelvic exenteration is removal of bladder, urethra, rectum, vulva, vagina, and uterus. It might leave the patient with a urinary or feacal conduit. Anterior exenteration is removal of the bladder, vagina and uterus and the development of a bladder conduit. Posterior exenteration involves removal of vagina, uterus and rectum and the development of a faecal stoma.</P>
<P>Reconstructive surgery: the vulval defect is closed with flaps (fascio, myocutaneous etc.).</P>

<P>The title and abstract screening of references using the original search strategy identified 21 studies as potentially eligible for this review. The updated search strategy identified 78 references in MEDLINE, 201 in EMBASE, none in CENTRAL and three in the Specialised Register. When the search results were merged into Endnote and the duplicates removed there were 229 unique references. The title and abstract screening of these references identified 39 references as potentially eligible for the review. Overall, the full text screening of these 39 references excluded 36 for the reasons described in the table <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_EXCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of excluded studies</LINK>.

All of them had advanced stage primary vulval cancer. Women with recurrent disease or early stage cancer were excluded in this review. In the <LINK REF="STD-Landrum-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Landrum 2008</LINK> study, four women had stage 4b disease but this only accounted for less than 3% (4/141) of the total number of women analysed in the review so the study was included.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Study design</HEADING>
<P>Two of the studies were retrospective and one was an RCT, but only the abstract of the RCT was available. The authors of the RCT kindly provided additional information on request.</P>
<P>In terms of the intervention, the two retrospective studies (<LINK REF="STD-Landrum-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Landrum 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mulayim-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Mulayim 2004</LINK>) looked at primary chemoradiation versus primary surgery and <LINK REF="STD-Maneo-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Maneo 2003</LINK>, which was an RCT, looked at neoadjuvant chemoradiation versus primary surgery.</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Landrum-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Landrum 2008</LINK> 43% had adjuvant radiation, 20% had adjuvant chemoradiation after primary surgery. In <LINK REF="STD-Mulayim-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Mulayim 2004</LINK> all six women had adjuvant chemoradiation after primary surgery. In <LINK REF="STD-Maneo-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Maneo 2003</LINK> 15 women (15/27) had adjuvant radiotherapy after primary surgery.</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Landrum-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Landrum 2008</LINK> the median follow up was 31 months, in <LINK REF="STD-Mulayim-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Mulayim 2004</LINK> the median follow up was 20 months. The mean and median follow up was 42 months and 40 months respectively in the RCT by <LINK REF="STD-Maneo-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Maneo 2003</LINK>.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Participant characteristics</HEADING>
<P>Both retrospective studies subgrouped the patients into stage III and stage IV, <LINK REF="STD-Mulayim-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Mulayim 2004</LINK> also reported the TNM classification of malignant tumours whereas for the RCT of <LINK REF="STD-Maneo-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Maneo 2003</LINK> the data on TNM staging was provided by the authors.</P>
<P>In the two non-randomised studies, the number of women with stage III and stage IV was 57 and 19 respectively. Four of them had stage IVb disease and were included in the analysis as the overall percentage was less than 2.5% of the total number of women included. One study quoted the grade of the cancer (<LINK REF="STD-Mulayim-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Mulayim 2004</LINK>). The median age at diagnosis was 64 and 73 years in <LINK REF="STD-Landrum-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Landrum 2008</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Mulayim-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Mulayim 2004</LINK> respectively. The mean age in the RCT (<LINK REF="STD-Maneo-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Maneo 2003</LINK>) was 74 years at the time of diagnosis in both the arms.</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Landrum-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Landrum 2008</LINK> all patients that had a primary tumour that was inoperable or would require exenterative procedure underwent primary chemoradiation. Similarly in <LINK REF="STD-Mulayim-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Mulayim 2004</LINK>, patients with locally advanced disease that required extensive resection received primary chemoradiation. So in both retrospective studies, the decision to administer primary chemoradiation was largely based on prevention of exenterative surgery.However, in <LINK REF="STD-Landrum-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Landrum 2008</LINK> the clinical practice was to perform inguinofemoral lymphadenectomy to evaluate the node status and debulk the enlarged nodes prior to primary chemoradiation.</P>
<P>In the RCT by <LINK REF="STD-Maneo-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Maneo 2003</LINK>, all operable cases were randomised. The number of cases needing extensive resection before randomisation was eight in the neoadjuvant chemoradiation arm and five in the surgery arm.</P>
<P>With regards to adjuvant treatment following primary treatment, in <LINK REF="STD-Landrum-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Landrum 2008</LINK> eight (24%) patients underwent adjuvant surgery following primary chemoradiation and 19 patients (63%) underwent either adjuvant radiation or adjuvant chemoradiation following primary surgery. In <LINK REF="STD-Mulayim-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Mulayim 2004</LINK> one patient in the primary chemoradiation group underwent adjuvant surgery and all the patients who underwent primary surgery underwent adjuvant chemoradiation.</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Maneo-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Maneo 2003</LINK>, in the primary surgery arm, 15 (15/37) patients underwent adjuvant radiation. Surgery was feasible in 24 out of 28 patients in the neoadjuvant arm.</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Landrum-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Landrum 2008</LINK> there were a total of 12 recurrences, five in the primary chemoradiation group and seven in the primary surgery group. In <LINK REF="STD-Mulayim-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Mulayim 2004</LINK> there were four recurrences, one in the primary chemoradiation group and three in the primary surgery group.</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Maneo-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Maneo 2003</LINK> there were 30 recurrences, 13 in the neoadjuvant chemoradiation arm and 17 in the primary surgery arm.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Outcomes</HEADING>
<P>Overall survival (OS) was discussed in all the papers. The authors of <LINK REF="STD-Landrum-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Landrum 2008</LINK> provided us with an adjusted hazard ratio for overall survival, and individual patient data were presented in the <LINK REF="STD-Mulayim-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Mulayim 2004</LINK> study so it was possible to attempt our own adjusted hazard ratio estimate. <LINK REF="STD-Landrum-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Landrum 2008</LINK> adjusted the hazard ratio for overall survival for important prognostic factors which included age, FIGO stage, size of tumour and nodal status. The RCT of <LINK REF="STD-Maneo-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Maneo 2003</LINK> reported 5-year survival rates in each treatment arm so it was possible to estimate a risk ratio for risk of death. Progression-free survival was reported in the <LINK REF="STD-Landrum-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Landrum 2008</LINK> study, but this was not examined as an outcome in any multivariate analyses. The <LINK REF="STD-Mulayim-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Mulayim 2004</LINK> study reported recurrence-free survival times for each patient, so it was possible to attempt our own adjusted hazard ratio estimate. Quality of life data were not reported in any of the trials and the reporting of adverse events was incomplete. The <LINK REF="STD-Landrum-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Landrum 2008</LINK> study did not report adverse events, <LINK REF="STD-Maneo-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Maneo 2003</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Mulayim-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Mulayim 2004</LINK> reported an extensive range of adverse events for all their patients.</P>

These criteria were not relevant to the two non-randomised studies (<LINK REF="STD-Landrum-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Landrum 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mulayim-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Mulayim 2004</LINK>) so these studies were at high risk of bias for these individual quality items. Blinding of the outcome assessor was not carried out in the trial of <LINK REF="STD-Maneo-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Maneo 2003</LINK> and was not reported in any of the other studies. There was insufficient information to make judgement on whether any additional risk factor for bias existed or whether there had been selective reporting of outcomes, in all three studies. The <LINK REF="STD-Landrum-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Landrum 2008</LINK> study did not analyse progression-free survival in a multivariate analysis, but the main outcome was overall survival. This was reported and was not statistically significant so it seems unlikely progression-free survival was not reported in a multivariate analysis because it was not significant. All of the studies assessed an adequate proportion of their recruited women, as at least 94% of eligible women were assessed at the endpoint for all outcomes.</P>
<P>Both non-randomised studies fully reported details of the assignment of women to the two methods of treatment, but the two groups were not representative of the wider population of women with locally advanced vulval cancer as interventions were decided depending on particular disease characteristics. The data were too sparse in the <LINK REF="STD-Mulayim-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Mulayim 2004</LINK> study to assess comparability of treatment groups as there were only 12 women who met the inclusion criteria. Women in the <LINK REF="STD-Landrum-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Landrum 2008</LINK> study appeared to be comparable as the only predictor of overall survival was found to be age in a multivariate Cox model and age was not significantly different between the two groups at baseline (P = 0.09).</P>

However, the <LINK REF="STD-Landrum-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Landrum 2008</LINK> study found no statistically significant difference in the risk of death in women with locally advanced primary vulval cancer between women who received primary chemoradiation and those who received primary surgery, after adjustment for important prognostic factors which included age, FIGO stage, size of tumour and nodal status (HR 1.09, 95% CI 0.37 to 3.17).

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2011-02-15 11:35:55 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We found one RCT and two retrospective studies that met our inclusion criteria. These studies assessed the effectiveness and safety of primary chemoradiation, neoadjuvant chemoradiation and primary surgery in women with locally advanced primary vulval cancer.</P>
<P>All comparisons were restricted to single study analyses, where we found no evidence that any form of chemoradiation prolonged the survival of women or was associated with greater safety in terms of adverse events in women with locally advanced primary vulval cancer when compared to primary surgery. There were also insufficient data or no reporting of recurrence-free survival in the three studies. This review was based on only 141 women and meta-analyses were not possible, so it was not adequately powered to detect differences in survival.</P>
<P>Despite the fact that vulval cancer is predominantly a disease of elderly women (<LINK REF="REF-Jemal-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jemal 2006</LINK>), the RCT and two retrospective studies all had a relatively short follow-up period. The RCT had a mean follow up of 42 months and the studies of <LINK REF="STD-Landrum-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Landrum 2008</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Mulayim-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Mulayim 2004</LINK> had median follow ups of 31 and 20 months respectively. Adverse effects of treatment were reported in the two retrospective studies and there was no statistically significant difference in adverse events between the different treatments.</P>
<P>Quality of life (QoL) was not reported in any of the studies.
 
QoL may be of additional importance to both elderly and young women who may be psychologically scarred as well as having obvious physical limitations to their life after developing the disease and receiving treatment.
 
We did not find any studies that directly compared primary versus neoadjuvant chemoradiation or any form of chemoradiation with primary or neoadjuvant radiation.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2011-02-28 11:07:21 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>From this review, the evidence that chemoradiation(primary or neoadjuvant) and primary surgery are useful modalities of treatment for locally advanced vulval cancer is relevant. This can be applied to women with locally advanced vulval cancer. Whether one treatment modality is better or worse than the other in terms of overall survival is not completely conclusive as the numbers of women included in the review are small. Although individual patient data were presented in the two retrospective studies, the criteria for assignment of patients to treatment was selective so statistical adjustment was necessary to minimise bias. Unfortunately the data were too sparse to offer any satisfactory conclusions in the multivariate analyses that were performed.</P>
<P>The studies were incomplete in terms of comparing all available primary modalities of treatment for locally advanced vulval cancer, for example there were no studies comparing primary chemoradiation versus neoadjuvant chemoradiation or neoadjuvant chemotherapy.</P>
<P>Two studies in the review addressed the adverse effects of various treatments, but again the numbers were small and no meta-analyses were possible to make definite conclusions.</P>
<P>The data on QoL was incomplete, hence conclusions cannot be drawn on QoL for the various treatments.</P>
<P>Overall the evidence, though weak, does not favour one primary treatment over the other.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2011-02-15 11:35:55 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The two retrospective studies have a higher degree of bias due to the methodology (retrospective) and the entry criteria for the various treatments. The exact reasons for preferring one treatment over the other were not well documented.The RCT did not report a hazard ratio, which is the best statistic to summarise the difference in risk between two treatment groups over the duration of a trial when there is 'censoring', that is the time to death (or disease progression) is unknown for some women as they were still alive (or disease free) at the end of the trial. It instead reported 5-year survival rates in each group. Adjustments for type of surgery were not very obvious in all the studies. The details of extensive surgery, which was prevented or could have been prevented, was not well documented. A meta-analysis could not be carried out as the numbers in the studies were small and for overall survival an adjusted estimate could not be obtained in either of the clinically similar studies. The reporting of the methodological quality of the studies showed that two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Landrum-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Landrum 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mulayim-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Mulayim 2004</LINK>) were at high risk of bias as they only satisfied two of the criteria used to assess risk of bias, while the trial of <LINK REF="STD-Maneo-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Maneo 2003</LINK> was at moderate risk of bias as it only satisfied three of the six core criteria used to assess risk of bias in RCTs. Hence the evidence is weak and incomplete and does not allow for a robust conclusion based on the objectives.</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2010-11-27 01:57:55 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>A comprehensive search was performed, including a thorough search of the grey literature, and all studies were sifted and data extracted independently by two review authors. We were not restrictive in our inclusion criteria with regards to types of studies as we included non-randomised studies with concurrent comparisons groups that used multivariate analyses, as we suspected that we would not find any relevant RCTs. Therefore we attempted to ensure that we did not overlook any relevant evidence and searched a wide range of reasonable quality non-randomised study designs (case-control studies and case series of fewer than 10 patients were excluded).</P>
<P>The greatest threat to the validity of the review is likely to be publication bias; that is studies that did not find the treatment to be effective may not have been published. We were unable to assess this possibility as we did not find an adequate number of studies that met the inclusion criteria.</P>
</POTENTIAL_BIASES>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2011-02-28 11:15:23 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There were many prospective phase II studies which had good methodological quality but were excluded as there were no comparison groups (<LINK REF="STD-Landoni-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Landoni 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Montana-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Montana 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moore-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Moore 1998</LINK>). The review article by <LINK REF="STD-Moore-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Moore 1998</LINK> concluded that on the basis of many good phase II studies, chemoradiation therapy is now inherent to the clinical management of vulval cancer and international collaboration is needed to conduct prospective RCTs due to the rarity of the disease. The review article by <LINK REF="STD-Gadducci-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Gadducci 2006</LINK> also proposed chemoradiation followed by tailored surgery as an attractive option based on available evidence. Even though this seems to be a logical conclusion, as chemoradiation reduces the need for extensive surgery,clearly there is a lack of evidence as to which type of chemoradiotherapy (primary versus neoadjuvant) is best suited. The stratification of disease based on inoperability due to lymphnodes or local tumour is not very clear in many excluded studies, and the available evidence for primary surgery and neoadjuvant chemoradiation is not strong enough to recommend any one primary treatment over combined treatments, or vice versa.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2011-02-15 11:35:55 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There was no evidence of a survival advantage when chemoradiation (primary or neoadjuvant) was compared to primary surgery for women with locally advanced vulval cancer. There was no statistically significant difference in treatment-related adverse effects with the above mentioned methods of treatment. Due to sparse data and the relatively high risk of bias in the included studies, we are unable to reach definite conclusions about the relative benefits and harms of the different forms of treatment, and we are unable to identify subgroups of women who are likely to benefit from one form of treatment to the other.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2011-02-28 10:28:53 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The evidence is weak. There is a great need for an RCT or, at the very least, comparative non-RCTs that include multivariate analysis or statistical adjustments. There is a need to find a suitable radiosensitising chemotherapeutic agent or agents for this tumour type. Finding the right radiotherapeutic dose,regime and type to minimise the adverse effects is also essential. The quality of life issues with extensive surgery versus various chemoradiation therapeutic treatments should be addressed. International collaboration is needed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of various treatments due to the rarity of the tumour.</P>

<P>Primary chemoradiation therapy (PCRT): 33 patients who otherwise would have required exenterative surgery to obtain adequate tumour free surgical margin were treated with PCRT. Concurrent chemoradiation(platinum and 5- flurouracil) with a variety of radiation techniques and doses to suit the disease characteristics and individual needs of the patient were administered. 25 patients underwent lymphadenectomy prior to PCRT, 6 patients who had gross nodes underwent lymphadenectomy after PCRT, 2 patients did not have suspicious nodes so did not undergo lymphadenectomy at any point. 8 patients underwent surgical excision of residual disease following PCRT out of whom 2 required posterior exenteration.</P>
<P>Primary surgery (PS): 30 patients were treated with primary surgery (radical/modified radical vulvectomy). This group underwent radical or modified vulvectomy. 19 of 25 patients who had positive lymph nodes following primary surgery completed adjuvant radiation or chemoradiation.</P>

<P>Significant improvements in OS (P=0.002) and PFS (P=0.03) were noted in younger patients compared to older patients.</P>
<P>No difference in OS and PFS groups with other prognostic factors like lesions size, nodal metastasis, stage, treatment group.</P>
<P>Dr Landrum kindly presented us with an estimate of the adjusted HR for OS from the Cox model, corresponding to the following text, "When clinical size of lesion, stage, treatment group and number of positive lymph nodes were accounted for in a multivariate analysis, the only predictor of OS was age. In a separate model in which size, stage, treatment group and number of positive lymph nodes were accounted for, there were no significant predictors for OS".</P>
