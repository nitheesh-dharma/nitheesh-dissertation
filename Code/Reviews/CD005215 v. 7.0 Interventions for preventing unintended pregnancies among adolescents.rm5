<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2016-01-14 13:43:51 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Interventions for preventing unintended pregnancy include any activity (health education or counselling only, health education plus skills-building, health education plus contraception education, contraception education and distribution, faith-based group or individual counselling) designed to increase adolescents' knowledge and attitudes relating to risk of unintended pregnancies; promote delay in initiation of sexual intercourse; encourage consistent use of birth control methods and reduce unintended pregnancies.</P>
<P>This review included 53 randomised controlled trials comparing these interventions to various control groups (mostly usual standard sex education offered by schools). The search for trials was not limited by country, though most of the included trials were conducted in high-income countries, with just four trials in middle- and low-income countries, mainly representing the lower socio-economic groups. Interventions were administered in schools, community centres, healthcare facilities and homes. Meta-analysis was performed for studies where it was possible to extract data.</P>
<P>Only interventions involving a combination of education and contraception promotion (multiple interventions) was seen to significantly reduce unintended pregnancy over the medium-term and long-term follow-up period. Results for behavioural (secondary) outcomes were inconsistent across trials.</P>
<P>Limitations of this review include reliance on programme participants to report their behaviours accurately and methodological weaknesses in the trials.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2016-01-14 14:42:16 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Unintended pregnancy among adolescents represents an important public health challenge in high-income countries, as well as middle- and low-income countries. Numerous prevention strategies such as health education, skills-building and improving accessibility to contraceptives have been employed by countries across the world, in an effort to address this problem. However, there is uncertainty regarding the effects of these interventions, hence the need to review the evidence-base.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2008-08-03 06:26:17 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>To assess the effects of primary prevention interventions (school-based, community/home-based, clinic-based, and faith-based) on unintended pregnancies among adolescents.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2016-01-14 13:43:42 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We searched all relevant studies regardless of language or publication status up to November 2015. We searched the Cochrane Fertility Regulation Group Specialised trial register, The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (<I>The Cochrane Library</I> 2015 Issue 11), MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS, Social Science Citation Index and Science Citation Index, Dissertations Abstracts Online, The Gray Literature Network, HealthStar, PsycINFO, CINAHL and POPLINE and the reference lists of articles.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2016-01-14 13:43:42 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included both individual and cluster randomised controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating any interventions that aimed to increase knowledge and attitudes relating to risk of unintended pregnancies, promote delay in the initiation of sexual intercourse and encourage consistent use of birth control methods to reduce unintended pregnancies in adolescents aged 10 years to 19 years.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2016-01-14 13:43:42 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two authors independently assessed trial eligibility and risk of bias, and extracted data. Where appropriate, binary outcomes were pooled using a random-effects model with a 95% confidence interval (Cl). Where appropriate, we combined data in meta-analyses and assessed the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-01-14 13:43:51 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included 53 RCTs that enrolled 105,368 adolescents. Participants were ethnically diverse. Eighteen studies randomised individuals, 32 randomised clusters (schools (20), classrooms (6), and communities/neighbourhoods (6). Three studies were mixed (individually and cluster randomised). The length of follow up varied from three months to seven years with more than 12 months being the most common duration. Four trials were conducted in low- and middle- income countries, and all others were conducted in high-income countries.</P>
<P>
<I>Multiple interventions</I>
</P>
<P>Results showed that multiple interventions (combination of educational and contraceptive-promoting interventions) lowered the risk of unintended pregnancy among adolescents significantly (RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.50 to 0.87; 4 individual RCTs, 1905 participants, <I>moderate quality evidence</I>. However, this reduction was not statistically significant from cluster RCTs. Evidence on the possible effects of interventions on secondary outcomes (initiation of sexual intercourse, use of birth control methods, abortion, childbirth, sexually transmitted diseases) was not conclusive.</P>
<P>Methodological strengths included a relatively large sample size and statistical control for baseline differences, while limitations included lack of biological outcomes, possible self-report bias, analysis neglecting clustered randomisation and the use of different statistical tests in reporting outcomes.</P>
<P>
<I>Educational interventions</I>
</P>
<P>Educational interventions were unlikely to significantly delay the initiation of sexual intercourse among adolescents compared to controls (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.27; 2 studies, 672 participants, <I>low quality evidence).</I>
</P>
<P>Educational interventions significantly increased reported condom use at last sex in adolescents compared to controls who did not receive the intervention (RR 1.18, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.32; 2 studies, 1431 participants, <I>moderate quality evidence).</I>
</P>
<P>However, it is not clear if the educational interventions had any effect on unintended pregnancy as this was not reported by any of the included studies.</P>
<P>
<I>Contraceptive-promoting interventions</I>
</P>
<P>For adolescents who received contraceptive-promoting interventions, there was little or no difference in the risk of unintended first pregnancy compared to controls (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.26; 2 studies, 3,440 participants, <I>moderate quality evidence</I>).</P>
<P>The use of hormonal contraceptives was significantly higher in adolescents in the intervention group compared to those in the control group (RR 2.22, 95% CI 1.07 to 4.62; 2 studies, 3,091 participants, <I>high quality evidence</I>)</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2016-01-14 13:43:51 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>A combination of educational and contraceptive-promoting interventions appears to reduce unintended pregnancy among adolescents.  Evidence for programme effects on biological measures is limited. The variability in study populations, interventions and outcomes of included trials, and the paucity of studies directly comparing different interventions preclude a definitive conclusion regarding which type of intervention is most effective</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2016-01-14 13:44:29 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The World Health Organization defines adolescents as individuals between 10 years and 19 years of age (<LINK REF="REF-WHO--1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1980</LINK>). Adolescence is a period of transition, growth, exploration and opportunities. During this phase of life, adolescents experience physical and sexual maturation and tend to develop an increased interest in sex, with attendant risks of unintended pregnancies, health risks associated with early childbearing, abortion outcomes, and sexually transmitted infections, including HIV/AIDS.</P>
<P>Adolescents who have an unintended pregnancy face a number of challenges, including abandonment by their partners, inability to complete school education (which ultimately limits their future social and economic opportunities), and increased adverse pregnancy outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-Henshaw---2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Henshaw 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Koniak_x002d_Griffin--2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Koniak-Griffin 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kosunen--2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kosunen 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moore--1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Phipps--2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Phipps 2002</LINK>;, <LINK REF="REF-Upchurch--1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Upchurch 1990</LINK>).</P>
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2016-01-14 13:44:01 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Unintended pregnancy among adolescents is a common public health problem in industrialised, middle- or low-income countries (<LINK REF="REF-WHO--1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1995</LINK>). The number of unintended pregnancies is reported to be on the decline in the US, with the Office of Adolescent Health reporting a 10% drop from 2012 to 2013, and more than a 50% drop between 1991 and 2013 (<LINK REF="REF-Hamilton-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hamilton 2014</LINK>). The same decline was seen across all racial groups but some disparities remain: Black and Hispanic teens make up a large proportion of teen births in the US (<LINK REF="REF-Hamilton-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hamilton 2014</LINK>). The same trend is reported in most countries (<LINK REF="REF-World-Bank-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">World Bank 2014</LINK>): in sub-Saharan Africa, there was a decline in the fertility rate among adolescents from 134 live births per 1000 in 2000 to 115 live births per 1000 in 2010, although these rates are still high when compared to the world standard; in India, adolescent pregnancies constitute 19% of total fertility (<LINK REF="REF-Mehra--2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mehra 2004</LINK>) but this rate has been declining with 77 live births per 1000 in 2010 as compared to 109 live births per 1000 in 2000; and an Israeli study estimated the incidence of teenage pregnancy in Israel to be 32 live births per 1000 adolescent girls (<LINK REF="REF-Sikron--2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sikron 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>Repeat pregnancies among adolescents are also common and are associated with increased risks of adverse maternal and child health outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-Nelson--1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nelson 1990</LINK>). Unintended pregnancy is not only costly to the teenagers and their families, it is also a huge financial burden to the state, borne by taxpayers in high-income nations. It was estimated that spending on medicaid-subsidised medical care related to unintended pregnancy totals more than USD 12 billion annually (<LINK REF="REF-Thomas-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thomas 2009</LINK>). These costs include welfare support for mothers experiencing financial difficulties, implementation of programmes (educational and skills training) to empower mothers to gain financial independence, and lost tax revenues arising from reduced employability and earnings (<LINK REF="REF-Burt--1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burt 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Haveman--1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haveman 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Maynard--1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maynard 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rich_x002d_Edwards--2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rich-Edwards 2002</LINK> ).</P>
<P>Adolescent mothers are more likely to perform poorly in school, come from low socio-economic homes and a less advantageous environment; and be themselves children of mothers with limited school education and a history of unintended teenage pregnancies (<LINK REF="REF-Elfebein--2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elfebein 2003</LINK>). Children born to adolescent mothers are more likely to have low birth weight, and become victims of physical neglect and abuse (<LINK REF="REF-Elfebein--2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elfebein 2003</LINK>), more likely to end up as school-dropouts like their mothers, or engage in delinquent behaviours (<LINK REF="REF-Monea-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Monea 2011</LINK>).</P>

<THEORY MODIFIED="2016-01-14 13:44:15 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Interventions that are designed to reduce teen pregnancy appear to be most effective when a multifaceted approach is used, as the problem is multiple determined  and multidimensional. The interventions should not only focus on sexual factors and related consequences, they should also include non-sexual factors such as skills training, and personal development. Further, stakeholders including pregnant teens, parents, the health sector, schools and churches should work together to devise programmes that are practical, evidence based, culturally appropriate and acceptable to the target population.</P>
<P>Some interventions focus primarily on changing the psychosocial risk and protective factors that involve sexuality. One such is <I>Safer Choices</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Coyle-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Coyle 2001</LINK>) which improves teens&#8217; knowledge about the risks and consequences of pregnancy and STDs, values and attitudes regarding sex, perceptions of peer norms about sex and contraception, self-efficacy (ability to say &#8216;no&#8217; to unwanted sex), consistent use of contraception including condoms, and their intentions regarding sexual behaviours.  Some interventions promote abstinence only (<LINK REF="REF-Denny-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Denny 2006</LINK>), and others add a comprehensive, health-education approach wherein safer sexual practices are also included (<LINK REF="STD-Jemmott-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Jemmott 1998</LINK>). Sex and STD/HIV education programmes for parents and teens seek to improve parent/child communication regarding sexual health and sexuality, and promote connectedness (<LINK REF="STD-Dilorio-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Dilorio 2006</LINK>). Clinic protocols and one-on-one programmes promote practices that provide advance supplies of emergency contraceptives to high risk adolescents (<LINK REF="REF-Lindberg-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lindberg 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Orr-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Orr 1996</LINK>), as well as providing health counselling for young men (<LINK REF="STD-Danielson-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Danielson 1990</LINK>).</P>
<P>Other interventions, such as youth development endeavours, focus on non-sexual factors, which aim to engender positive values in adolescents, inspire hope for the future, improve performance in school and bolster family relationships. They also aim to reduce risky behaviours such substance abuse and violence; promote service-learning programmes which provide supervised voluntary community-service opportunities, as well as mentoring opportunities on skills-building (<LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Donnell-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Donnell 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Philliber-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Philliber 1992</LINK>). Some make use of trained peer educators to conduct the health-education sessions serving as mentors or role models in achieving sustained behavioural changes (<LINK REF="STD-Borgia-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Borgia 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>Experts suggest that in order to reduce teenage pregnancies, interventions should be designed to address multiple sexual and non-sexual antecedents that correlate with adolescent sexuality, and which may be related to the adolescents, their families, schools, communities and cultural factors - notably religion (<LINK REF="STD-Kirby-2002a" TYPE="STUDY">Kirby 2002a</LINK>). Interventions should also include publicly-financed mass media campaigns and expanding government-subsidised family-planning services (<LINK REF="REF-Thomas-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thomas 2012</LINK>).</P>
<P>With regard to cultural factors, while one Israeli study showed that the incidence of pregnancy was three times higher among Muslims than among Jews (<LINK REF="REF-Sikron--2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sikron 2003</LINK>), another showed that women with no religious affiliation had the highest unintended pregnancy rate compared to women with religious affiliation, and that these women were also most likely to end the pregnancy by abortion (<LINK REF="REF-Finer-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Finer 2006</LINK>). This raises questions about the possible impact of faith-based interventions, which tend to start early and are often sustained for long periods at the home and community levels. In some communities, premarital or extra-marital sex, whether in young or older people, is seen by the larger society as a violation of morality. Most moral codes and laws that prescribe acceptable conducts of sexual relationships have their origin in major religions.</P>

<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2016-01-14 13:44:29 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Evaluation studies of specific interventions as well as reviews and meta-analyses of the effects of current strategies show discrepant evidence of effectiveness (<LINK REF="REF-DiCenso--2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">DiCenso 2002</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Fullerton--1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fullerton 1997</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Maness-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maness 2013</LINK>). For example, a review of 73 studies reported that four intervention programmes resulted in delay in initiation of sexual intercourse, increased condom and contraceptive use, and reduced unintended teenage pregnancy (<LINK REF="REF-Kirby---2002b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kirby 2002b</LINK>). The interventions identified as being effective in that review were sex and HIV education curricula; one-on-one clinician-patient protocols in healthcare settings; service learning programmes; and intensive youth development programmes (<LINK REF="REF-Kirby---2002b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kirby 2002b</LINK>).</P>
<P>Another systematic review of randomised controlled trials showed that several primary prevention measures did not delay the initiation of sexual intercourse nor reduce the number of pregnancies among adolescents (<LINK REF="REF-DiCenso--2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">DiCenso 2002</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Maness-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maness 2013</LINK>). As this review demonstrated, a small number of programmes actually led to an increase in the number of pregnancies among partners of male participants of abstinence programmes (<LINK REF="REF-DiCenso--2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">DiCenso 2002</LINK>). One author had attributed the small decline in the level of adolescent pregnancy in the US to a decrease in sexual activity and an increase in contraceptive use, especially long-term contraceptive injectables and implants (<LINK REF="REF-Pettinato--2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pettinato 2003</LINK>), fear of contracting HIV/AIDS, health education programmes, a changing moral climate, new contraceptives, and improved economic climate (<LINK REF="REF-Klerman---2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Klerman 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>It is possible that discrepancies in results of existing reviews and meta-analyses may partly be explained by design flaws in the evaluation of studies and reviews. For example, most reviews included non-randomised and observational studies; most were limited in scope through their exclusion of unpublished studies; very few included rigorous statistical analysis, and some were based on surveys (<LINK REF="REF-Franklin--1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Franklin 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>This calls for rigorous reviews to more clearly elucidate the effects of these interventions, taking cognizance of the complex and multi-factorial nature of adolescent sexuality and pregnancy.</P>
<P>Moreover, most of the reviews were limited to industrialised nations (<LINK REF="REF-DiCenso--2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">DiCenso 2002</LINK>), and thus could not account for any influences of social, cultural, and economic factors in diverse populations. Such reviews have limited value to bilateral agencies and international NGOs working in the field of adolescent health promotion. In light of this, the Cochrane systematic approach was used to limit bias (systematic errors) and reduce chance effects, thereby providing more reliable results upon which to draw conclusions and make rational and evidence-based recommendations (<LINK REF="REF-Antman--1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Antman 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Oxman--1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oxman 1993</LINK>). This review draws from the expertise and resources already developed within Cochrane in general and Cochrane Fertility Regulation in particular.</P>
<P>In this review, we assessed and summarised the effects that adolescent pregnancy prevention interventions have on: [i] adolescents' knowledge and attitudes relating to risks of unintended pregnancies, [ii] delay in initiation of sexual intercourse, [iii] consistent use of birth control methods, and [iv] reduction in unintended pregnancies. To reduce publication bias (<LINK REF="REF-Cook--1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cook 1993</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Dickersin--1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dickersin 1990</LINK>), we considered all published and unpublished randomised controlled studies that assessed the effectiveness of interventions to reduce unintended pregnancy among adolescents, written in any language. Studies conducted in both high-income and middle- and low-income countries were also considered (<LINK REF="REF-WHO--1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1995</LINK>). This body of evidence will help to elucidate what works, and what does not in the efforts to reduce unintended pregnancies among adolescents, and thus help to justify the use of scarce resources, train public health professionals, and facilitate the design of interventions that are effective.</P>

Blinding was not reported in the remaining 42 studies. The impossibility of blinding intervention staff may have given rise to performance bias.</P>
<P>Contamination or 'exchange of information' of the control group might have occurred as the intervention and control groups sometimes attended different programmes at the same site. This is more likely to be present in trials that randomised participants by individual or classroom, rather than by entire community centre, school or neighbourhood. This, however, leads to bias in the findings in the direction of no effect rather than in the direction of significance.</P>

<P>Apart from the primary outcome, most included studies reported a range of outcomes (sexual behaviour), using different recall periods and grouping outcomes such as initiation of intercourse at three months and six months, and use of condoms at last sex, thus suggesting no standard set of outcomes for evaluation, preventing a comprehensive meta-analysis.</P>
<P>Results were also analysed based on subgroups of participants, for example, measuring initiation of intercourse among virgins and non-virgins at baseline. However, more often, sexual initiation was often assessed only among participants who reported never having had sexual intercourse at baseline.</P>

<P>The lack of statistical controls for cluster-randomised data, is a limitation for this study.

<HEADING LEVEL="6">Limitations of self-report and behavioural outcome data</HEADING>
<P>Most of the studies made use of self-reported data which is an inevitable source of bias for studies evaluating sexual behaviours (as there is the tendency for respondents to agree with statements associated with healthier behaviours or attitudes). However, the veracity of the self-reported behaviours was improved by privacy and confidentiality in most studies.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Heterogeneity in programme design and implementation across trials</HEADING>
<P>A major source of bias in this review is a high degree of heterogeneity in the ways programmes were designed and implemented across trials. This can be seen in some of the meta-analyses carried out. Our inclusion criteria specified that we would accept interventions that aimed to prevent unintended pregnancy while promoting safer-sex strategies such as condom use or contraceptive use but it is unclear how much emphasis was put on these goals. An example is <LINK REF="STD-Eisen-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Eisen 1990</LINK> that offered almost the same intervention to both groups differing only in the level of emphasis and duration of the intervention, or studies offering same intervention but administered differently such as peer-counsellor facilitators versus adult staff (<LINK REF="STD-Ferguson-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Ferguson 1998</LINK>) and <LINK REF="STD-Downs-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Downs 2004</LINK>, interactive video versus book form or brochure of the same intervention.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Finding relevant trials</HEADING>
<P>Though the search for relevant trials was comprehensive, it is likely that relevant trials may have been omitted from this review, if the specified search terms were not mentioned in the title and abstracts but most likely due to inability to assess all unpublished trials.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Underreporting of implementation data</HEADING>
<P>Inadequate description of programme design and implementation made the assessment of heterogeneity challenging. Differences in the way that programmes were designed, delivered, and taken up may have made the studies too heterogeneous to permit comparisons across trials; however, these differences are difficult to determine from the available data and could have influenced the meta-analyses. Few studies reported strategies to monitor and promote the extent to which programmes were delivered by facilitators and taken up by participants as planned. Such strategies include take-home assignments, keeping attendance records, conducting interviews with programme staff and participants, bringing in independent raters (<LINK REF="STD-Morrison_x002d_Beedy-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Morrison-Beedy 2013</LINK>), conducting exit interviews with participants, and communication with participants by phone (<LINK REF="STD-Herceg_x002d_Brown-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Herceg-Brown 1986</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Dilorio-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Dilorio 2006</LINK>). One study regularly trained all programme staff, visiting each site regularly (<LINK REF="STD-Philliber-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Philliber 2002</LINK>). Though these strategies were put in place, most trials rarely stated the extent of implementation fidelity. One study <LINK REF="STD-Morberg-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Morberg 1998</LINK>, reported difficulties for community-based programme activities to convey programme messages related to sexual behaviour due to vocal opposition; at one programme site, a member of the community opposition group attended every programme session related to sexual behaviour, potentially affecting programme delivery.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-01-04 13:00:16 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Denise M Mitchell">
<P>Limited information suggests that programmes that involve concurrent application of multiple interventions (educational, skill building and contraception promotion) can reduce rates of unintended pregnancies in adolescents. Reviews done by <LINK REF="STD-Kirby-2002c" TYPE="STUDY">Kirby 2002c</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Manlove-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Manlove 2002</LINK>; National Research Council (<LINK REF="REF-NRC-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">NRC 1987</LINK>) have also highlighted the need for multiple strategies to address this public health challenge. Sensitivity analyses including trials with lower risk of bias showed that more cases of unintended pregnancy were reported in the control group than those that received multiple preventive interventions. Promoting the use of contraceptive measures alone did not appear to reduce the risk of unintended pregnancy. There was insufficient data to show whether education as a single intervention would reduce the risk of unintended pregnancy.</P>
<P>The possible effects of these preventive interventions on secondary outcomes such as time of initiation of sexual intercourse, risk of sexually transmitted infections and use of contraceptive measures like condoms and pills were not conclusively determined because of insufficient data and variation in methods of reporting.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">External validity</HEADING>
<P>Some of the limitations of this review include the relatively small data sets available for the main outcomes of interest, and the likelihood of incomplete reporting of such outcomes as abortion, which have the potential to affect the rate of unintended pregnancy reported.</P>
<P>Furthermore, most of the trials were conducted in high-income countries, thus this may limit the applicability of the results in middle- or low-income countries.</P>
<P>Another limitation is the small number of studies with a true control group (without any intervention capable of reducing the incidence of unintended pregnancy). Because most of the trial settings already had community-wide interventions (primarily in schools) aimed at improving adolescent sexual behaviours, it was difficult to find trials that had a control arm that was totally devoid of any form of educational intervention. The situation is likely to be different in low-income countries, where such interventions may not be as widespread, making it more feasible to set up trials with true control arms.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Evidence in the practice context</HEADING>
<P>The evidence provided in this review shows that concurrent application of preventive interventions such as education, skills-building and contraception promotion could lower the incidence of unintended pregnancies in adolescents but the fact that most of the trials were conducted in industrialised countries (especially the USA) and among the lower socio-economic populations, raises issues about applicability. The socio-cultural context as well as cost implications of these interventions should be considered in efforts to introduce such measures in low-income countries. Many low- and middle-income countries may lack the infrastructure and resources to successfully implement these interventions. Trials in such resource-poor settings would be needed to address some of these contextual and location-specific issues.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Summaries for stakeholders</HEADING>
<P>Application of the findings of this review should be approached with caution given the methodological deficiencies of included trials, the substantial heterogeneity across trials in the ways programmes were delivered and the frequent omission of methodological details and implementation information from primary trial reports.</P>

<P>We assessed the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach (<LINK REF="REF-Sch_x00fc_nemann-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schünemann 2011</LINK>) and have presented it in four &#8217;Summary of findings&#8217; tables (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>; <LINK REF="SOF-02" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 2</LINK>; <LINK REF="SOF-03" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 3</LINK>; <LINK REF="SOF-04" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 4</LINK>). We assessed the evidence for the following outcomes: reduction of unintended pregnancy; reduction in the initiation of sexual intercourse; and increase in the use of birth controls (condoms or hormonal contraceptives, or both) for the different groups of interventions.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Unintended Pregnancy</HEADING>
<P>We considered the evidence for a reduction in unintended pregnancies to be moderate quality, and low quality for both the contraceptive-promoting interventions (downgraded for imprecision) and for multiple interventions (downgraded for risk of bias (ROB), imprecision and inconsistency) (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>; <LINK REF="SOF-03" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 3</LINK>

<P>Evidence for the reduction in the initiation of intercourse was considered low quality (downgraded for ROB and imprecision); while evidence for use of condom at last sex was considered moderate quality (downgraded for ROB only). (<LINK REF="SOF-02" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 2</LINK>)</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Multiple interventions</HEADING>
<P>Evidence for studies that employed multiple interventions was grouped into individual and cluster randomised controlled trials (<LINK REF="SOF-03" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 3</LINK>; <LINK REF="SOF-04" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 4</LINK>). For Individual RCTs, evidence for reduction in initiation of intercourse and condom use at last sex was considered moderate quality (downgraded for ROB only); evidence for consistent use of condoms and reduction in sexually transmitted diseases was considered low quality (downgraded for ROB and inconsistency) and very low quality (downgraded for ROB, inconsistency and imprecision) respectively. Evidence from cluster RCTs was considered moderate quality (downgraded for ROB only) for condom use at last sex, low quality (downgraded for ROB and imprecision) for consistent condom use and reduction in sexually transmitted diseases; and very low quality (downgraded for ROB, imprecision and inconsistency) for reduction in initiation of intercourse and use of hormonal contraception.</P>
<P>Overall, the studies had several important strengths: most had large sample sizes, long-term follow-up, described the development of data collection instruments, used techniques to promote the validity of self-reported data, controlled for baseline differences in statistical analyses, and reported the causes and possible impacts of attrition.</P>
<P>Methodological quality was sometimes difficult to judge due to incomplete reporting of key methodological features and it was often difficult to obtain additional information by contacting the trial authors due to data loss and non-response. Weaknesses include the underreporting of key methodological features; few of the trials specified the procedures used for assigning participants, or concealed allocation, blinded outcome assessors or separated programme facilitators between the intervention and control groups.</P>
<P>Five studies reported adequate allocation concealment using sealed, opaque envelopes (<LINK REF="STD-Diclemente-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Diclemente 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jemmott-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Jemmott 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Raine-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Raine 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Raymond-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Raymond 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Philliber-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Philliber 2002</LINK> ).

<HEADING LEVEL="6">Attrition at last follow-up</HEADING>
<P>Sixteen studies included more than 90% of randomised participants in the analysis (defined in the review methods as adequate), thirty-seven had greater than 10% attrition and accounted for less than 90% of randomised participants in the data analysis (inadequate), and two studies did not mention number of participants lost to follow up.

While one study (<LINK REF="STD-Kirby--1997a" TYPE="STUDY">Kirby 1997a</LINK>) explained that using individuals as the unit of analysis gave no significant results thus no need for adjusting for clusters. These studies are potentially vulnerable to bias due to incorrect analysis and could result in one or more statistically significant effect occurring by chance.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Limitations of outcome measures:</HEADING>
<P>All outcome data in this review are vulnerable to self-report bias except for pregnancy and STDs in the following studies: <LINK REF="STD-Jemmott-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Jemmott 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Raine-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Raine 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Raymond-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Raymond 2006</LINK>. These studies used biological outcomes which are better indicators for pregnancy and STDs. Self-reported behavioural outcomes unavoidably introduce self-report bias. Most behavioural outcomes were reported in subgroups and varied greatly such as initiation of intercourse ("last sex", "sex in the last three months", "sex among virgins"). Follow-up periods also varied greatly. Likewise the use of contraceptives; while some studies used the term "contraceptive", others differentiated it into condom use, hormonal contraceptives, pills. The reporting of sub-groups also varied. The results of this review highlight the need for a standardised set of outcome measures with explicit definitions, consistent follow-up times and recall periods to enable comparisons across primary trials. Long-term follow-up data are also particularly relevant for studies of unintended pregnancy and sexual behaviour, although these studies tend to lose large numbers of study participants to follow up. One study (<LINK REF="STD-Guilamo_x002d_Ramos-2011b" TYPE="STUDY">Guilamo-Ramos 2011b</LINK>), reported "had vaginal intercourse" as one of its outcomes but did not indicate if individuals analysed excluded those who reported any sexual intercourse.</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2016-01-14 13:47:37 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There are several potential biases in the review process. Our search strategy, though exhaustive may have not been enough to identify all potentially important unpublished data, thus the review is not without publication bias. Several randomised controlled trials that we included did not measure unintended pregnancy which is the primary outcome in this review.</P>
<P>While assessing trials for inclusion, we might have omitted trials that aimed at preventing unintended pregnancy as they may not have included any of the search terms in their title or abstract. We hope to correct this in future updates.</P>
<P>Another source of bias is our inability to obtain relevant missing data, including methodological characteristics and outcome data leading to the exclusion of a number of trials from the meta-analysis. Twenty studies were included in the meta-analysis, of which the majority had various methodological limitations capable of increasing the risk of bias and definitely compromising the strength of evidence.</P>
<P>We encountered some difficulty finding a reliable intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) when computing the design effect for cluster randomised trials. Using the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011c" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011c</LINK>), we were able to run a sensitivity analysis for some of the data that provided enough information to calculate average cluster size using a range of possible ICC values. This could have affected the significance of results for isolated pair-wise comparisons in the direction of insignificance.</P>

<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2016-01-14 13:47:37 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Evidence about the prevention of unintended pregnancy in adolescence differed from a previous systematic review carried out (<LINK REF="REF-DiCenso--2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">DiCenso 2002</LINK>) as this reported that the interventions had no effect on the incidence of unintended pregnancy. The review did not include the recent trials, which reported a reduction in the incidence of unintended pregnancy in the intervention group (<LINK REF="STD-Cabezon-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Cabezon 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Philliber-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Philliber 2002</LINK>). Outcomes such as the initiation of sexual intercourse and contraceptive use showed no significant difference between intervention and control irrespective of intervention, a finding consistent with the previous review.</P>

<P>The results of this review suggest that the concurrent use of interventions such as education, skills-building and contraception promotion reduces the risk of unintended pregnancy in adolescents but offers little evidence about the effect of each of these interventions offered alone. Overall, the evidence remains inconclusive, and could not be the basis for recommending the use or discontinuation of any of these interventions where they are already in use.</P>

<P>The trials included in this review reported outcomes in different ways and were largely based in industrialised countries. There is a need to develop a uniform approach to reporting outcomes in these types of trials to make for comparability across studies and geographical context. More trials need to be conducted in low income countries to provide a balance of evidence with regard to the obvious disparities in socio-cultural and economic situations.</P>
