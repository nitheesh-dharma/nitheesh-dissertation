<SUMMARY>
<TITLE>Laser photocoagulation for treating neovascular age-related macular degeneration</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Laser photocoagulation was the first treatment introduced to try to halt the progression of neovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD), in which newly formed vessels or choroidal neovascularisation (CNV) grow under the macula leading to the occurrence of a scotoma or blind spot in the central visual field. One disadvantage is that it causes a dark spot in the visual field. This is of concern when the lesion is in the centre of the macula. Fifteen trials involving a total of 2064 participants were included. Three types of photocoagulation were used in the trials: direct photocoagulation of the entire CNV, perifoveal photocoagulation and grid photocoagulation. Control groups in the trials included observation only, submacular surgery and different lasers. This review found that the use of photocoagulation is effective for people with lesions that are outside the centre of the macula. However, these types of lesions are less common in AMD. Severe loss of vision can be prevented in about one in six people.</P>

<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Laser photocoagulation was the first treatment introduced to try to halt the progression of neovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD), in which newly formed vessels or choroidal neovascularisation (CNV) grow under the macula leading to the occurrence of a scotoma or blind spot in the central visual field.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>The aim of this review was to examine the effects of laser photocoagulation for neovascular AMD.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>We searched the CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS, NRR and ZETOC in March 2007. </P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>We included randomised trials of laser photocoagulation in people with CNV due to AMD.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Two authors independently extracted the data. The risk ratio (RR) of severe visual loss (loss of six or more lines of visual acuity) was estimated at three months and two years after treatment. </P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Fifteen trials were included in the review (2064 participants). Three types of photocoagulation were used in the trials: direct photocoagulation of the entire CNV (11 trials), perifoveal photocoagulation (one trial) and grid photocoagulation (three trials). In 12 trials the control group was observation only. One trial compared photocoagulation to submacular surgery and two trials compared different lasers. Data on the progression of visual loss could be extracted from five of the eight trials of direct photocoagulation of the CNV versus observation. The treatment effect was in the direction of harm in all studies at three months follow up (RR 1.41, 95% confidence intervals (CI) 1.08 to 1.82). After two years the treatment effect was in the direction of benefit (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.53 to 0.83). These studies were clinically heterogenous with participants having CNV lesions in different locations and different baseline visual acuities. There was little evidence of statistical heterogeneity at three months but substantial statistical heterogeneity at two years. However, all treatment effects in the individual trials were in the direction of benefit. One study comparing perifoveal photocoagulation or observation of subfoveal CNV found benefits that were statistically significant only at two years (RR 0.36, 95% CI 0.18 to 0.72). Other comparisons did not demonstrate differences.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>In the medium to long term laser photocoagulation of CNV slows the progression of visual loss in people with neovascular AMD. However, it is associated with an increased risk of visual loss immediately after treatment and this period may be longer in people with subfoveal AMD. With the advent of modern pharmacological therapies, and concern for the impact of iatrogenic scotoma in subfoveal CNV, laser photocoagulation of subfoveal CNV is not recommended. No studies have compared photocoagulation with modern pharmacological agents for AMD for non-subfoveal CNV.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Introduction</HEADING>
<P>Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a leading cause of visual loss among older people in industrialised countries. It is the late or advanced stage of a broader disease called age-related maculopathy or ARM (<LINK REF="REF-IAE-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">IAE 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Klein-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Klein 1991</LINK>). There are two types of AMD. Neovascular (or wet) AMD occurs more commonly. A central blind spot in the visual field is caused by the occurrence of abnormal vessels, or new vessels, growing near or in the centre of the macula. These vessels come from the choroid (choroidal neovascularisation or CNV). They cause the formation of a fibrovascular scar that destroys the central retina. The second type of AMD, geographic atrophy, occurs less commonly. Atrophic changes of retinal and choriocapillaris tissues occur in the macula. This review is concerned with the treatment of neovascular AMD.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Epidemiology</HEADING>
<P>A recent study that pooled three large population-based studies from different continents found that the ratio between the prevalence of neovascular AMD and geographic atrophy was about 2:1 (<LINK REF="REF-Smith-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smith 2001</LINK>). Overall, AMD was present in 0.2% of the combined population aged 55 to 64 years, rising to 13% of the population older than 85 years. Because of longer life expectancy and the rarity of AMD among black people (<LINK REF="REF-EDPRG-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">EDPRG 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Friedman-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Friedman 1999</LINK>), this disease will have a greater impact on industrialised countries, especially those of the western world. Age-related macular degeneration was reported to be rare among Asians in population-based studies conducted in China and Japan (<LINK REF="REF-Iwase-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Iwase 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Li-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Li 2006</LINK>), however, it is common in people of Chinese origin living in USA (<LINK REF="REF-Klein-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Klein 2006</LINK>) .</P>
<P>Early ARM is a common condition in the elderly. Its typical features are visible fundus lesions, such as various types of drusen and retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) hypo- and hyperpigmentation. People who have early ARM with extensive fundus lesions, such as large and numerous drusen, have a substantial risk of developing AMD. This has been demonstrated in many cohort studies. For example, in the Age-Related Eye Disease Study (<LINK REF="REF-AREDS-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">AREDS 2001</LINK>) those participants who had a few, small drusen had a very low five-year cumulative incidence of AMD, about 1%, whereas this was 18% among those participants with at least one large drusen in the macula. People who had AMD in one eye had the highest risk of having the fellow eye affected (42% at five years).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Presentation and diagnosis</HEADING>
<P>Early symptoms due to CNV include blurred central vision and metamorphopsia (objects appear distorted) (<LINK REF="REF-Fine-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fine 1986</LINK>). Because AMD often becomes a bilateral disease, the resulting central visual loss will impair activities such as driving, reading, recognising faces and finding small objects. Orientation is usually only mildly impaired, except in the most severe cases.</P>
<P>Clinical diagnosis is usually simple, with a fundus examination. In neovascular AMD, the CNV is often seen as a subretinal mound, with a various degree of pigmentation, associated with subretinal fluid and haemorrhage; a serous pigment epithelial detachment may develop and hard exudates can be seen in some chronic lesions. After several weeks or months the CNV often evolves to a subretinal fibrotic scar. Fluorescein angiography is required in neovascular AMD in order to characterise the neovascular lesion. In fact, the natural course of the disease and the technique and outcome of treatment may vary according to the location of the CNV with respect to the centre of the macula (foveola) and commonly identified as the centre of the foveal avascular zone (FAZ). They also may vary according to the type of CNV, also assessed with fluorescein angiography and subdivided as well-defined versus poorly defined lesions in early studies conducted by the Macular Photocoagulation Study Group (<LINK REF="STD-MPS-Argon-Extra" TYPE="STUDY">MPS Argon Extra</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MPS-Krypton-Juxta" TYPE="STUDY">MPS Krypton Juxta</LINK>). This classification evolved in the current angiographic concept of classic versus occult CNV (<LINK REF="STD-MPS-Krypton-Juxta" TYPE="STUDY">MPS Krypton Juxta</LINK>). In recent studies that demonstrated the effectiveness of photodynamic therapy (PDT) in reducing visual loss in some patients with neovascular AMD (<LINK REF="REF-TAP-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">TAP 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-TAP-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">TAP 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-VIP-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">VIP 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wormald-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wormald 2003</LINK>), the proportion of the overall lesion area which is occupied by classic CNV was also a fundamental criterion for establishing the indication to treatment of subfoveal lesions.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Treatment options</HEADING>
<P>Until PDT was made commercially available in 2000, laser photocoagulation was the only available treatment for CNV in AMD. Other treatment modalities, such as transpupillary thermotherapy (<LINK REF="REF-Gustavsson-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gustavsson 2005</LINK>) or macular translocation (<LINK REF="REF-Fujii-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fujii 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lambert-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lambert 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vander-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vander 2000</LINK>), have not gained popularity because their effectiveness has not been demonstrated in large randomised controlled studies (RCTs) and because of safety concerns. Submacular surgery was not found beneficial as compared to observation for some types of CNV in the Submacular Surgery Trial (SST) (<LINK REF="REF-SST-2004a" TYPE="REFERENCE">SST 2004a</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-SST-2004b" TYPE="REFERENCE">SST 2004b</LINK>). Radiotherapy for CNV in AMD has been evaluated in some RCTs which yielded inconsistent results (<LINK REF="REF-Sivagnanavel-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sivagnanavel 2004</LINK>). Studies have been published (<LINK REF="REF-Brown-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brown 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-D_x0027_-Amico-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">D' Amico 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Eyetech-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eyetech 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gragoudas-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gragoudas 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rosenfeld-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rosenfeld 2006</LINK>) or are being conducted on several antiangiogenic drugs trying to arrest CNV before it leads to end-stage disease.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Rationale for a systematic review</HEADING>
<P>Since its introduction, PDT has become the main technique for treating neovascular AMD due to the fact that most lesions are subfoveal at presentation. Many clinicians believe that laser photocoagulation has a role in the treatment of non-subfoveal lesions in this disease (<LINK REF="REF-Verteporfin-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Verteporfin 2002</LINK>). A systematic review of this topic will be useful to patients, ophthalmologists and other professionals involved in providing eye health care.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>The primary objective of this review was to examine the effects of laser photocoagulation for CNV associated with AMD. A secondary objective was to compare the effects of different photocoagulation techniques and location of lesion.</P>

<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>We included trials in which laser photocoagulation was compared with no treatment or sham treatment. We also included trials that compared the different photocoagulation techniques, for example, different laser wavelengths. We included any type of laser photocoagulation, whether directed to the entire CNV or to part of it, such as is done with treatments less commonly employed (such as grid photocoagulation or perifoveal photocoagulation). During the search for trials we found a study comparing photocoagulation to submacular surgery (<LINK REF="STD-SST-2000" TYPE="STUDY">SST 2000</LINK>). We decided to modify the protocol to include this type of comparison, since this pilot trial is useful to assess the need for further research.</P>

<CRIT_OUTCOMES MODIFIED="2008-10-16 13:34:46 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>The preservation of vision-related quality of life is the main goal of any treatment. However, questionnaires to assess vision-related quality of life (QOL) have been developed only in recent years and most studies on photocoagulation for neovascular AMD were conducted before these instruments had been developed. Direct measures of visual performance in real life or with laboratory testing have never been standardised. For this reason, visual acuity and contrast sensitivity were considered as primary outcome measures and QOL was considered as a secondary outcome measure. Standard instruments to measure visual acuity and contrast sensitivity have been available from the early 1980s (<LINK REF="REF-Ferris-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ferris 1982</LINK>). Both measures have been shown to be highly correlated with vision-related quality of life, as assessed by questionnaires in later studies (<LINK REF="REF-Mangione-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mangione 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McClure-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">McClure 2000</LINK>). The lack of standard instruments makes it difficult to report on reading ability, which represents one of the principal tasks allowed by central vision. Reading difficulty has been the first complaint reported by people with visual loss in a QOL study (<LINK REF="REF-Mangione-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mangione 1998</LINK>) and it was strongly associated with quality of life in another (<LINK REF="REF-McClure-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">McClure 2000</LINK>).</P>
<CRIT_OUTCOMES_PRIMARY MODIFIED="2008-10-16 13:33:49 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>(1) Visual acuity. This is usually measured with a standard chart, the ETDRS (Early Treatment of Diabetic Retinopathy Study) chart, and scored in letters. There are five letters per line in this chart. Dichotomous outcomes, such as moderate (three or more lines or 15 ETDRS letters) and severe (six or more lines or 30 ETDRS letters) visual loss were extracted when possible. Continuous visual acuity was not extracted since means and standard deviation were rarely available. Where studies did not use ETDRS charts, visual acuity was converted to logMAR (logarithm of the Minimum Angle of Resolution) for pooling data. This is necessary because this scale allows maintaining proportional changes of the visual angle for each unit.</P>
<P>(2) Contrast sensitivity. This is usually measured with the Pelli-Robson chart. Scores are collected in letters or as logarithm of contrast sensitivity. We planned to extract both continuous and dichotomous measures if possible. For dichotomous data, we planned to record the proportion of participants with a change of at least 0.3 or 0.6 log-units, corresponding to a two-fold or a four-fold change respectively. Since these data were not available, we extracted the number of participants with a contrast threshold worse than 10%, which is believed by practitioners to be a critical level for low-vision rehabilitation.</P>
</CRIT_OUTCOMES_PRIMARY>
<CRIT_OUTCOMES_SECONDARY MODIFIED="2008-10-16 13:34:46 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>(1) Reading ability measured with any reading chart. If data can be pooled in future updates of the review, measures will be converted to logMAR for reading acuity, whereas reading speed will be considered as the logarithm of the number of words read in a minute.<BR/>(2) Performance in real-world or laboratory vision-related tasks other than reading.<BR/>(3) Score obtained with QOL vision-specific questionnaires.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Adverse effects (severe, minor)</HEADING>
<P>Inadvertent photocoagulation of the foveola is a rare but known complication of CNV photocoagulation that can cause immediate visual loss. In eyes with subfoveal lesions, foveal treatment is indicated (<LINK REF="STD-MPS-Subf.-New" TYPE="STUDY">MPS Subf. New</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MPS-Subf.-Recurrent" TYPE="STUDY">MPS Subf. Recurrent</LINK>). Early visual loss is likely to be a major complication of photocoagulation in these cases. Another event leading to immediate visual loss soon after photocoagulation may be subretinal haemorrhage. The main adverse effect of photocoagulation, independently of the mechanism, is visual loss. The comparison of treated and control eyes, especially during the first months for subfoveal lesions (<LINK REF="STD-MPS-Subf.-New" TYPE="STUDY">MPS Subf. New</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MPS-Subf.-Recurrent" TYPE="STUDY">MPS Subf. Recurrent</LINK>), will be useful to evaluate safety. Moreover, the benefits of photocoagulation may be lost in cases with CNV recurrence or persistence. The hypothesis that eyes suffering from such complications have a worse outcome with respect to untreated eyes was considered as a possible adverse event and was evaluated by comparing their visual outcome both during the first and the late follow up phases of the studies.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Economic data</HEADING>
<P>Data on costs sustained during the studies was described if available. If no trials including economic outcomes are found, we will incorporate results from studies modeling cost-effectiveness of laser photocoagulation of CNV in the discussion (<LINK REF="REF-Brown-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brown 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Busbee-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Busbee 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<B>
<I>Follow up</I>
</B>
<BR/>A follow up of two years was considered sufficient for evaluating the effectiveness of the treatment. Data up to five years were collected if available. Outcomes were assessed at three months to evaluate effectiveness but also to detect early adverse effects due to treatment, especially in cases with subfoveal lesions. Thereafter, treatment outcomes were summarised yearly from one year after the first treatment.</P>

<P>Two review authors assessed the titles and abstracts resulting from the electronic searches. The full copies of all relevant or potentially relevant trials were obtained and assessed according to the 'Criteria for considering studies for this review'. Only trials meeting these criteria were assessed for methodological quality. The review authors were not masked to the names of the authors, the institutions, journal of publication or results when making their assessments. Disagreements about whether a trial should be included were resolved by discussion and consensus. In cases where additional information was needed before a decision could be made whether to include a trial, an attempt was made to obtain this information by contacting the trialists.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Assessment of methodological quality</HEADING>
<P>Two review authors assessed trial quality according to the methods set out in Section 6 of the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (</I>
<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2006</LINK>) and the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Group review development guidelines. All full copies for inclusion in the review were assessed for methodological quality. Four parameters were considered that relate to the following types of potential bias: selection bias, performance bias, detection bias and attrition bias. Each parameter of trial quality was graded: A (adequate); B (unclear); C (inadequate). We contacted study authors for clarification on any item graded B. Authors were not masked to the report authors and trial results during the assessment.</P>
<P>Selection bias was graded based on the question 'Was the sequence of allocation of participants to groups concealed until after treatments were allocated?' Grade A (adequate) was given when the study used: randomisation by a central office; on-site computer system, provided that the computer file containing the assignments was locked; serially-numbered, sealed, opaque envelopes or sequential administration of pre-numbered or coded containers to enrolled participants; or other approaches that appear to offer adequate concealment combined with the statement that the person who generated the allocation did not administer it. Grade B (unclear) was assigned when a list or a table was used and envelopes but without a qualifying statement. It was also given if concealment was apparently adequate but other information in the trial indicated that concealment may not have been adequate. Grade C (inadequate) corresponded to assignment based on alternation, case record numbers, dates of birth or days of the week, or any allocation that is entirely transparent before allocation.</P>
<P>Performance bias was graded in response to the questions 'Were the recipients of care unaware of their assigned treatment?', 'Were persons providing care unaware of the assigned treatment?'. We suggest that this would be possible for participants when studying photocoagulation using a sham laser treatment e.g. setting power at zero. However, the effect of laser photocoagulation is visible on the retina, especially with fluorescein angiography, and therefore masking of care providers was not considered.</P>
<P>Detection bias was graded based on the question 'Were persons assessing outcome unaware of the assigned treatment?' We considered that this could be achieved for visual acuity examiners. On the other hand, masking cannot be achieved for anatomic outcome assessors, since the evaluation of fluorescein angiography, which is the main method of anatomic follow up of CNV after photocoagulation, can usually identify the laser scar. Grade A was assigned when visual acuity examiners were masked to allocation status, grade B (unclear) was assigned when masking was not described and grade C (inadequate) was assigned when visual acuity examiners were aware of allocation or coincided with the care provider.</P>
<P>Attrition bias was graded based on the questions: 'Were rates of follow up similar in the comparison groups?', 'Was the analysis 'intention-to-treat' (were all patients analysed as randomised)? No formal criterion was adopted as a definition of similar follow up and the judgment was based on the authors' agreement on the similarity in the two groups. Grade B (unclear) was assigned if information on follow up was insufficient. The analyses were considered 'intention-to-treat' only if this was clearly detailed or declared in the article. When no statement was provided, this parameter was graded B (unclear).</P>

<BR/>To characterise lesion type with fluorescein angiography (<LINK REF="REF-Verteporfin-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Verteporfin 2002</LINK>), we considered the presence and characteristics of the neovascular and non-neovascular lesion components as well as lesion location with respect to the centre of the foveal avascular zone (FAZ).</P>
<P>
<I>Lesion components<BR/>
</I>Neovascular lesion components are classic and occult CNV defined as follows.<BR/>(1) Classic CNV. A pattern characterised by a well-demarcated area of bright hyperfluorescence in the early phase with leakage through the mid- and late- fluorescein angiographic phases, which obscures the boundaries of the area.<BR/>(2) Occult CNV. Pathologic hyperfluorescence divided in two patterns:<BR/>(a) fibrovascular pigment epithelial detachment, or an irregular elevation of the retinal pigment epithelium that shows stippled or non-homogeneous fluorescence usually within one to two minutes of fluorescein injection, with well- or poorly demarcated boundaries;<BR/>(b) late-phase leakage of undetermined source, or leakage at the level of the RPE in late angiographic phases, in which the source of the late leakage cannot be determined from early-phase frames and does not correspond to classic CNV.<BR/>Stereoscopic images are necessary to fully apply these definitions, but an overall distinction between classic and occult CNV may be clinically achieved even without them.</P>
<P>Non-neovascular lesion components include either blocked fluorescence associated with CNV, such as by blood, fibrin or turbid fluid, or pathologic hyperfluorescences such as serous pigment epithelial detachment, which commonly appears as a well defined, bright and homogeneous fluorescence with no leakage.</P>
<P>
<I>Demarcation of CNV borders<BR/>
</I>We also recorded a distinction between well and poorly demarcated lesions, depending on the demarcation between the boundary of the lesion and uninvolved retina. This definition does not coincide with that opposing classic to occult CNV, and was initially adopted by the MPS Group (<LINK REF="STD-MPS-Argon-Extra" TYPE="STUDY">MPS Argon Extra</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MPS-Krypton-Juxta" TYPE="STUDY">MPS Krypton Juxta</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<I>Lesion location with respect to the FAZ centre<BR/>
</I>The following definitions were adopted to characterise the position of the lesion (including neovascular and non-neovascular components) with respect to the fovea (<LINK REF="STD-MPS-Krypton-Juxta" TYPE="STUDY">MPS Krypton Juxta</LINK>).<BR/>(1) Extrafoveal lesion: posterior edge of the lesion 200 microns or more from the centre of the FAZ.<BR/>(2) Juxtafoveal lesion: posterior edge of the lesion between 1 and 199 microns from the centre of the FAZ.<BR/>(3) Subfoveal lesion: lesion involving the centre of the FAZ.</P>
<P>
<B>
<I>Interventions<BR/>
</I>
</B>We provided a description of the photocoagulation technique adopted in the study, particularly with respect to:<BR/>(1) distance of the lesion from the centre of the FAZ;<BR/>(2) area of the lesion which was photocoagulated (usually direct treatment of the entire lesion, or less commonly other types of photocoagulation such as perifoveolar, grid or feeder vessel treatment);<BR/>(3) type of wavelength used to achieve photocoagulation (blue-green argon, green argon, red krypton, near-infrared diode or others);<BR/>(4) intensity of photocoagulation, expressed as intensity of the retinal whitening that was achieved (mild photocoagulation: grey discoloration of the overlying retina; heavy photocoagulation: intense white discoloration of the overlying retina). Laser settings allowed in the study (laser power, spot size and duration), as outlined in the protocol for this review, were not collected since they were inconsistently described in the manuscripts as compared to photocoagulation intensity.</P>
<P>We reported on the modalities with which the sham (control) treatment was performed, when applicable. If a different photocoagulation technique is used as a control in future studies, both techniques will be described as reported above. Criteria used to decide on whether and when applying further photocoagulation, such as follow up schedule and criteria for evaluation of treatment success (usually absence of dye leakage with fluorescein angiography) were summarised.<BR/>
<B>
<I>
<BR/>Outcomes<BR/>
</I>
</B>We collected data relative to the visual acuity and, secondarily, to contrast sensitivity and reading ability. We intended to collect data on real-world or laboratory vision-related tasks and vision-related QOL questionnaires.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Data extraction and entry</HEADING>
<P>Both review authors extracted data. We planned to obtain mean and standard deviations for continuous variables such as logMAR visual acuity, the logarithm of contrast sensitivity, reading acuity in logMAR, and reading speed as a crude value or as the logarithm of words read in a minute. The proportion of participants suffering from the adverse event was recorded for dichotomous outcomes, specifically the proportion of participants suffering from a loss of at least three lines or at least six lines of visual acuity. If necessary in future updates of this review, means will be computed from frequency distributions when only the latter will be available. Individuals rather than eyes were the unit of analysis. Data were entered into RevMan by both review authors, using the double data-entry facility to check for errors and inconsistencies.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Data synthesis</HEADING>
<P>For dichotomous data we present the risk ratio. We chose not to present the risk difference for all comparisons, as initially stated in the protocol, due to the large number of analyses in this review. We decided to provide the risk difference expressed as its reciprocal, the number needed to treat to benefit (NNTB) or the number needed to treat to harm (NNTH), only when a statistically significant difference was found. When percentages of participants with visual loss were available in survival curves or from estimates of longitudinal data models, the cross-tabulation of treatment groups and outcome was reconstructed using the percentages and the total of participants in each group. The reason for this choice is that the reader can choose the measure of effect in <I>The Cochrane Library</I> if data are input as dichotomous. This is not possible if the original percentages are input using the inverse variance method after estimating their standard errors. Since the dataset reconstruction was needed only for large MPS studies, the approximation due to rounding of the percentages to an integer count of participants was negligible.</P>
<P>In updates to this review, we will calculate the mean difference for continuous data. If the outcome is measured using different instruments, but if they are similar enough to be combined, we will present the standardised mean difference. We will only analyse the means if the data are approximately normally distributed.</P>
<P>We anticipated that there would be heterogeneity between studies due to differences in study design and conduct (i.e. study quality) and differences in the effectiveness of laser photocoagulation in the different study populations. We estimated the level of heterogeneity using the I<SUP>2</SUP> value (calculated in RevMan). If substantial heterogeneity was detected (i.e. a high I<SUP>2</SUP> value) we pooled the results of the studies if examination of the forest plot indicated that the individual trial results were all consistent in the direction of the effect (i.e. the risk ratios and confidence intervals largely fall on one side of the null line).</P>
<P>We planned to explore the sources of heterogeneity using the following subgroups.<BR/>(1) Study quality.<BR/>(2) Distance of the lesion from the foveola: (subfoveal, juxtafoveal, extrafoveal).<BR/>(3) Lesion composition with respect to presence of classic and/or occults CNV components.<BR/>(4) Demarcation of lesion borders (well versus poorly defined).<BR/>(5) Baseline visual acuity.</P>
<P>Since we found only one trial per class of distance from the fovea, the assumption that any statistical heterogeneity was due to this factor is unrealistic. In fact, other baseline characteristics of the sample in each study and especially visual acuity could be relevant, despite the importance of the distance from the FAZ centre on the use of laser photocoagulation is widely recognised in clinical practice. Therefore, data on clinical heterogeneity are presented in the <I>Results</I> and discussed in the <I>Discussion</I> sections of this review.</P>
<P>We used the following models for calculating summary measures:<BR/>(1) fixed-effect model when the number of trials in the comparison was three or less. We compared the fixed-effect and random-effects models in this case,<BR/>(2) random-effects model if the number of trials was greater than three. In updates to this review we will check that the funnel plot is symmetrical if at least 10 studies are pooled.</P>
<P>Confidence intervals at 95% level were reported for all summary measures.</P>
<P>We used additional figures (x axis = time, y axis = relative risk (risk ratio), vertical bars represent 95% confidence intervals) to allow for a graphical exploration of the change of the treatment effect during follow up.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Sensitivity analysis</HEADING>
<P>Sensitivity analyses were planned as follows but were not necessary in the current version of the review:<BR/>(1) excluding studies of lower methodological quality (i.e. graded C on any parameter);<BR/>(2) excluding unpublished studies;<BR/>(3) excluding industry-funded studies;<BR/>(4) excluding studies that have assumed that eyes within an individual are independent.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Participants</HEADING>
<P>All the participants were affected by AMD. Five studies required an age of 50 or more and the presence of drusen or RPE abnormalities in the study or in the fellow eye as inclusion criteria (<LINK REF="STD-Arnold-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Arnold 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Coscas-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Coscas 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moorfields-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Moorfields 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MPS-Argon-Extra" TYPE="STUDY">MPS Argon Extra</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MPS-Krypton-Juxta" TYPE="STUDY">MPS Krypton Juxta</LINK>). A definition of AMD could not be found in the other studies. The main difference among studies concerning the disease characteristic was CNV location with respect to the fovea. As seen in <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>, in MPS studies of direct CNV photocoagulation, extrafoveal lesions had the highest baseline visual acuity, and subfoveal lesions the worst. In fact, the proportion of eyes with visual acuity of 20/40 or more was 62% for extrafoveal lesions in <LINK REF="STD-MPS-Argon-Extra" TYPE="STUDY">MPS Argon Extra</LINK>, 32% for juxtafoveal lesions in <LINK REF="STD-MPS-Krypton-Juxta" TYPE="STUDY">MPS Krypton Juxta</LINK> and zero for subfoveal lesions in MPS Subfoveal.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Interventions</HEADING>
<P>Eleven studies compared laser photocoagulation and observation in participants with different location of the CNV with respect to the fovea: extrafoveal in one study (<LINK REF="STD-MPS-Argon-Extra" TYPE="STUDY">MPS Argon Extra</LINK>), juxtafoveal in two studies (<LINK REF="STD-MPS-Krypton-Juxta" TYPE="STUDY">MPS Krypton Juxta</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yassur-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Yassur 1982</LINK>), a mix of extrafoveal and juxtafoveal lesions in three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Coscas-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Coscas 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moorfields-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Moorfields 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Versteeg_x002d_Tijmes-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Versteeg-Tijmes 1982</LINK>), and subfoveal in six studies (<LINK REF="STD-Arnold-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Arnold 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bressler-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Bressler 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cardillo-P.-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Cardillo P. 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Coscas-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Coscas 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MPS-Subf.-New" TYPE="STUDY">MPS Subf.

Different photocoagulation techniques were used when the lesion was subfoveal: treatment of the entire lesion including the FAZ (<LINK REF="STD-MPS-Subf.-New" TYPE="STUDY">MPS Subf. New</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-MPS-Subf.-Recurrent" TYPE="STUDY">MPS Subf. Recurrent</LINK>), treatment of the margin of the lesion excluding the FAZ (<LINK REF="STD-Coscas-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Coscas 1991</LINK>), and different types of grid photocoagulation directed to or around the neovascular lesion or both (<LINK REF="STD-Arnold-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Arnold 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bressler-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Bressler 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cardillo-P.-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Cardillo P. 1993</LINK>). Three studies compared the efficacy of different types of laser wavelength. <LINK REF="STD-Canadian-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Canadian 1993</LINK> compared argon green and krypton red for treatment of extrafoveal CNV. <LINK REF="STD-Duch-Mestres-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Duch Mestres 1993</LINK> compared argon green and dye red (630 nm) in a mix of extrafoveal and juxtafoveal CNV. Two MPS studies (<LINK REF="STD-MPS-Subf.-New" TYPE="STUDY">MPS Subf. New</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-MPS-Subf.-Recurrent" TYPE="STUDY">MPS Subf. Recurrent</LINK>) compared argon and krypton laser for treatment of either new or recurrent subfoveal CNV as a secondary study objective. Finally, a pilot study conducted by the Submacular Surgery Trial (<LINK REF="STD-SST-2000" TYPE="STUDY">SST 2000</LINK>) compared laser photocoagulation with surgical excision in participants with subfoveal CNV which had recurred after earlier photocoagulation of a non-subfoveal lesion.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Outcome measures</HEADING>
<P>All the trials reported visual acuity. <LINK REF="STD-Moorfields-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Moorfields 1982</LINK> used a scoring system of visual acuity and we calculated that most units corresponded to a change of two to three Snellen lines in the range of vision that was included in the study. Therefore we assumed that one unit could be used as an approximation of a three Snellen lines (15 ETDRS letters) change, a measure used by other studies. Visual acuity could not be extracted from some studies for various reasons. In <LINK REF="STD-Yassur-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Yassur 1982</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Duch-Mestres-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Duch Mestres 1993</LINK> and partly in <LINK REF="STD-Coscas-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Coscas 1983</LINK> we could not extract data because initial values were compared to final values at different follow up points. Because at least for one participant in <LINK REF="STD-Versteeg_x002d_Tijmes-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Versteeg-Tijmes 1982</LINK> the interval between visual acuity measurement and photocoagulation was several weeks, we decided that the quality of visual acuity assessment was too low to extract data from this small study. Three studies recorded contrast sensitivity (<LINK REF="STD-Bressler-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Bressler 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MPS-Subf.-New" TYPE="STUDY">MPS Subf.

<P>Visual acuity data could be extracted from six out of eight studies comparing photocoagulation of the entire CNV surface with observation (<LINK REF="STD-Coscas-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Coscas 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MPS-Argon-Extra" TYPE="STUDY">MPS Argon Extra</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moorfields-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Moorfields 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MPS-Krypton-Juxta" TYPE="STUDY">MPS Krypton Juxta</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MPS-Subf.-New" TYPE="STUDY">MPS Subf. New</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MPS-Subf.-Recurrent" TYPE="STUDY">MPS Subf. Recurrent</LINK>). Data up to five years were obtained for the four MPS studies (<LINK REF="STD-MPS-Argon-Extra" TYPE="STUDY">MPS Argon Extra</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MPS-Krypton-Juxta" TYPE="STUDY">MPS Krypton Juxta</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MPS-Subf.-New" TYPE="STUDY">MPS Subf. New</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MPS-Subf.-Recurrent" TYPE="STUDY">MPS Subf. Recurrent</LINK>) including 647 laser-treated eyes and 648 observed eyes with various CNV location with respect to the FAZ. The most commonly reported outcome was visual loss of six or more lines, which often was referred to as severe visual loss. The control event rate was about 55% in MPS studies including participants with extrafoveal and juxtafoveal CNV (<LINK REF="STD-MPS-Argon-Extra" TYPE="STUDY">MPS Argon Extra</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MPS-Krypton-Juxta" TYPE="STUDY">MPS Krypton Juxta</LINK>) and was close to 40% for subfoveal lesions (<LINK REF="STD-MPS-Subf.-New" TYPE="STUDY">MPS Subf. New</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MPS-Subf.-Recurrent" TYPE="STUDY">MPS Subf. Recurrent</LINK>) at two years. For this and for other outcomes, the treatment effect was often statistically homogeneous during follow up. However, there was clinical heterogeneity at baseline among the studies, particularly regarding CNV location and visual acuity, an issue that will be commented on in the <I>Discussion </I>section. Therefore, we recommend considering the estimates of effect from the individual studies and to examine the I<SUP>2</SUP> value to estimate how much the effect varies across studies. At three months (Analysis 01.01), comparisons were in favour of observation, but these reached statistical significance only in <LINK REF="STD-MPS-Subf.-New" TYPE="STUDY">MPS Subf. New</LINK> (NNTH 11, 95% CI 6 to 50). The pooled estimate was an NNTH of 20 (95% CI 13 to 100).</P>
<P>At two years (Analysis 01.02), a statistically significant advantage was recorded in <LINK REF="STD-MPS-Argon-Extra" TYPE="STUDY">MPS Argon Extra</LINK> (NNTB 6, 95% CI 3 to 20), in <LINK REF="STD-MPS-Subf.-New" TYPE="STUDY">MPS Subf.

The benefit was smaller and of borderline statistical significance in <LINK REF="STD-MPS-Krypton-Juxta" TYPE="STUDY">MPS Krypton Juxta</LINK>. Treatment was also beneficial, but not to a statistically significant extent, in <LINK REF="STD-Moorfields-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Moorfields 1982</LINK>, a smaller study including a mix of extra- and juxtafoveal lesions. Statistical heterogeneity was significant at two years but, as per protocol, we calculated a pooled estimate in Analysis 01.02 because all studies favoured photocoagulation (NNTB 6, 95% CI 5 to 9). Figures 01 to 05 (<LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>; <LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>; <LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK>; <LINK REF="FIG-04" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 4</LINK>; <LINK REF="FIG-05" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 5</LINK>) present the risk ratio of losing six or more lines during follow up in each study. It can be seen that the benefit was delayed in <LINK REF="STD-MPS-Subf.-New" TYPE="STUDY">MPS Subf. New</LINK>, being statistically significant only at 24 months. Data on the percentage of eyes with visual acuity worse than 20/200, a level corresponding to legal blindness in the USA, were available from one small study (<LINK REF="STD-Coscas-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Coscas 1983</LINK>) at one year and from two MPS studies (<LINK REF="STD-MPS-Argon-Extra" TYPE="STUDY">MPS Argon Extra</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MPS-Krypton-Juxta" TYPE="STUDY">MPS Krypton Juxta</LINK>), at three and five years of follow up (<LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK>).

<P>
<B>
<I>Direct photocoagulation of extrafoveal, juxtafoveal or subfoveal CNV<BR/>
</I>
</B>Laser photocoagulation of the entire surface of the CNV is a well known technique and has been used worldwide since the 1970s. To comment on the findings of the analyses presented in the <I>Results</I> section, we will discuss the issues of clinical and statistical heterogeneity among included studies, clinical impact of photocoagulation, patient selection based on MPS studies post hoc analyses, and finally the use of direct CNV photocoagulation after the advent of pharmacological treatments in different healthcare contexts.<BR/>
<I>
<BR/>Clinical and statistical heterogeneity across studies</I>
<BR/>There were important baseline differences in the clinical characteristics of the people included in the MPS studies (<LINK REF="STD-MPS-Argon-Extra" TYPE="STUDY">MPS Argon Extra</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MPS-Krypton-Juxta" TYPE="STUDY">MPS Krypton Juxta</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MPS-Subf.-New" TYPE="STUDY">MPS Subf. New</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MPS-Subf.-Recurrent" TYPE="STUDY">MPS Subf. Recurrent</LINK>). The most important difference was CNV location with respect to the FAZ centre, which is a study-specific characteristic due to explicit inclusion criteria. Baseline visual acuity is another important difference, as can be seen in <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>. It is associated with CNV location, since most eyes with extrafoveal CNVs had very good vision (<LINK REF="STD-MPS-Argon-Extra" TYPE="STUDY">MPS Argon Extra</LINK>), while most of those with subfoveal CNVs in MPS studies (<LINK REF="STD-MPS-Subf.-New" TYPE="STUDY">MPS Subf. New</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MPS-Subf.-Recurrent" TYPE="STUDY">MPS Subf. Recurrent</LINK>) had severe visual impairment at baseline, with juxtafoveal CNVs (<LINK REF="STD-MPS-Krypton-Juxta" TYPE="STUDY">MPS Krypton Juxta</LINK>) being in the middle. In the last three decades ophthalmologists have identified each MPS study with a specific class of CNV location in the macula, but at least baseline vision is an important determinant to apply the results to clinical practice. As an example, mean visual acuity was 20/50 (6/15) for occult subfoveal lesions in the VIP study on PDT (<LINK REF="REF-VIP-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">VIP 2001</LINK>) and no one would consider photocoagulation an alternative to PDT for these patients, since laser was harmful when vision is still good by the MPS Study Group (<LINK REF="STD-MPS-Subf.-New" TYPE="STUDY">MPS Subf. New</LINK>).</P>
<P>In our review, results were statistically heterogeneous at some points during follow up. While photocoagulation was not beneficial in any study at three months, there was a moderate to high degree of heterogeneity thereafter. More consistent benefits were found in <LINK REF="STD-MPS-Argon-Extra" TYPE="STUDY">MPS Argon Extra</LINK> and in <LINK REF="STD-MPS-Subf.-Recurrent" TYPE="STUDY">MPS Subf. Recurrent</LINK>, while the benefit was delayed or modest in <LINK REF="STD-MPS-Krypton-Juxta" TYPE="STUDY">MPS Krypton Juxta</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-MPS-Subf.-New" TYPE="STUDY">MPS Subf. New</LINK>. It must be kept in mind that there was only one study for each type of lesion, apart from <LINK REF="STD-Moorfields-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Moorfields 1982</LINK> which was a smaller study including a mix of extra- and juxtafoveal CNVs with results very similar to <LINK REF="STD-MPS-Krypton-Juxta" TYPE="STUDY">MPS Krypton Juxta</LINK>. Although we tend to identify each study with CNV location, other known or unknown patient characteristics in a study could affect statistical heterogeneity, especially baseline vision.</P>
<P>
<I>The impact of direct CNV photocoagulation on treated participants</I>
<BR/>The profile of the benefit with photocoagulation can be better understood if mean visual acuity is described. Although we did not extract continuous data for this outcome, since standard deviations or standard errors of the differences were not published, it is useful to report on the means in this discussion. Mean baseline visual acuity was about 20/40 (6/12) for eyes with extrafoveal CNV in <LINK REF="STD-MPS-Argon-Extra" TYPE="STUDY">MPS Argon Extra</LINK> and decreased to 20/125 (6/38) in treated eyes and 20/200 (6/60) in observed eyes after five years, with a mean loss of 5.2 and 7.1 Snellen lines respectively. In eyes with juxtafoveal CNV enrolled in <LINK REF="STD-MPS-Krypton-Juxta" TYPE="STUDY">MPS Krypton Juxta</LINK>, mean visual acuity was approximately 20/60 (6/18) for treated and control eyes at baseline and was 20/200 (6/60) for treated eyes and 20/250 (6/75) for observed eyes at five years, a drop of five and six lines respectively. In <LINK REF="STD-MPS-Subf.-New" TYPE="STUDY">MPS Subf. New</LINK>, mean visual acuity was about 20/125 (6/38) for treated and control eyes at baseline and decreased to 20/230 (6/96) and 20/500 (6/150) respectively after four years, with a mean drop of 3.5 and five lines respectively. In <LINK REF="STD-MPS-Subf.-Recurrent" TYPE="STUDY">MPS Subf. Recurrent</LINK>, baseline mean was about 20/125 (6/38) for treated and control eyes and it was 20/250 (6/75) and 20/320 (6/96) after four years respectively, a loss of three and four lines. Therefore, <LINK REF="STD-MPS-Subf.-New" TYPE="STUDY">MPS Subf. New</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-MPS-Subf.-Recurrent" TYPE="STUDY">MPS Subf. Recurrent</LINK> enrolled eyes with large initial visual deterioration. It is therefore clear that participants experienced mean visual deterioration in MPS studies. However, decades of clinical experience have taught us that photocoagulation is characterised by a dichotomised outcome at least for non-subfoveal CNVs, i.e. nearly stable visual acuity when CNV leakage is suppressed early during follow up or large deterioration when treatment fails, an outcome believed to be similar to the natural course by clinicians. In fact, the risk of visual loss of six or more lines at two years was 57% for treated eyes with recurrence compared to 8% among those without recurrence in <LINK REF="STD-MPS-Argon-Extra" TYPE="STUDY">MPS Argon Extra</LINK> and was 55 to 58% among treated eyes with persistence-recurrence compared to 14% for those with no leakage in <LINK REF="STD-MPS-Krypton-Juxta" TYPE="STUDY">MPS Krypton Juxta</LINK>. The rate of persistence or recurrence increased up to two years and showed a relative stabilisation later, the long-term success being about 1/2 for extrafoveal CNV and 1/4 for juxtafoveal CNV in <LINK REF="STD-MPS-Argon-Extra" TYPE="STUDY">MPS Argon Extra</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-MPS-Krypton-Juxta" TYPE="STUDY">MPS Krypton Juxta</LINK> respectively. These data are useful for presenting treatment outcomes to the few patients for which photocoagulation could be considered today.</P>
<P>Other outcome measures showed a different pattern across studies with respect to visual acuity. The harmful effect of photocoagulation was found again for reading speed at three months in <LINK REF="STD-MPS-Subf.-New" TYPE="STUDY">MPS Subf. New</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-MPS-Subf.-Recurrent" TYPE="STUDY">MPS Subf. Recurrent</LINK>, while after three months a benefit of borderline significance was found for new subfoveal CNV but not for recurrent CNV. A possible explanation for this is that further laser treatment after recurrent subfoveal CNV can increase the size of the absolute iatrogenic scotoma, which was found to inversely correlate with reading speed in a microperimetric study (<LINK REF="REF-Ergun-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ergun 2003</LINK>). Considering the percentage of participants with low contrast sensitivity, photocoagulation was not harmful and was indeed beneficial for all types of lesions in <LINK REF="STD-MPS-Subf.-New" TYPE="STUDY">MPS Subf. New</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-MPS-Subf.-Recurrent" TYPE="STUDY">MPS Subf. Recurrent</LINK> both at three months and at two years. The reason for this difference is difficult to interpret and highlights the complexity of the relationship between macular scotoma morphology and psychophysical measures of visual function associated to daily living tasks.<BR/>
<I>
<BR/>Improving efficacy with patient selection: post hoc analyses in MPS studies </I>
<BR/>The results of MPS studies can be applied to patients that are similar to those included, especially regarding CNV location, lesion composition and demarcation of its borders, and visual acuity. Nonetheless, post hoc analyses performed by the MPS Study Group have suggested that photocoagulation may be more effective for some patients. A publication by the MPS Study Group in 1996 (<LINK REF="STD-MPS-Krypton-Juxta" TYPE="STUDY">MPS Krypton Juxta</LINK>) suggested that the outcome of photocoagulation of juxtafoveal CNV might actually be better if the concept of classic and occult CNV is considered, which was not known when the studies were planned. The authors suggested that complete coverage of the neovascular lesion was associated with a better outcome and was more frequently achieved when the CNV was classic and no occult CNV was recognised at baseline, comprising approximately half of the sample. In this subgroup, the authors reported an adjusted odds ratio of 2.2 (95% CI 1.4 to 3.4) for avoidance of severe visual loss with photocoagulation, whereas no benefit was found when occult was also present. We could not extract data for this subgroup analysis, and it is difficult to evaluate the clinical impact of this post hoc analysis. Nonetheless, this suggestion agrees with a common clinical opinion that it is not appropriate to treat juxtafoveal lesions in which occult CNV is suspected even if the overall borders are well-defined.</P>
<P>In 1994, the MPS Group (<LINK REF="STD-MPS-Subf.-New" TYPE="STUDY">MPS Subf. New</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MPS-Subf.-Recurrent" TYPE="STUDY">MPS Subf. Recurrent</LINK>) published a report suggesting that categories of subfoveal lesions based on various combinations of small (up to one MPS disc areas) and medium (up to two MPS disc areas) lesion size with poor (20/200 or less) or moderate (20/125 to 20/160) visual acuity could suggest a larger benefit and no early visual loss due to photocoagulation (<LINK REF="REF-MPSG-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">MPSG 1994</LINK>). We could not extract data for this post hoc analysis. Despite the MPS guidelines, the acceptance of laser treatment to the centre of the FAZ has been sparse, especially in Europe, due to concern about the potential immediate occurrence of a iatrogenic absolute central scotoma. This is in spite of long-term benefit, especially for recurrent subfoveal lesions.</P>
<P>
<I>Photocoagulation in the era of new pharmacological therapies</I>
<BR/>This review showed that photocoagulation confers a definite advantage for extrafoveal CNV with well-defined borders such as those included in <LINK REF="STD-MPS-Argon-Extra" TYPE="STUDY">MPS Argon Extra</LINK>, as well as for recurrent subfoveal CNV that fits the criteria of <LINK REF="STD-MPS-Subf.-New" TYPE="STUDY">MPS Subf. New</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-MPS-Subf.-Recurrent" TYPE="STUDY">MPS Subf. Recurrent</LINK>, especially smaller size. The most important limitation of photocoagulation of extrafoveal CNVs is that such lesion location is very rare in AMD and therefore recurrent subfoveal CNVs are rare too. Patients with extrafoveal CNV can be offered this option, and should be informed that treatment may yield very good results in the half of cases that do not suffer from recurrence. <LINK REF="REF-Guyer-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guyer 1996</LINK> observed that 29% of the lesions in a series of 1000 consecutive patients with an occult CNV, which was not treatable based on fluorescein angiography, were small (less than one disc diameter) and well-defined with indocyanine green angiography (focal spots). They suggested that such lesions could be treated with photocoagulation. However, we could not find studies that randomised patients to photocoagulation or control based on indocyanine green rather than fluorescein angiography. Therefore, the efficacy of indocyanine green guided photocoagulation remains unknown.</P>
<P>We could not find trials comparing photocoagulation to new pharmacological therapies for extrafoveal neovascular lesions. If pharmacological treatments should prove to be able to prevent CNV growth in most cases, they might be an attractive option because macular scotoma is rarely induced, especially with antiangiogenic drugs. Another option could be to use laser first, and use new but expensive pharmacological therapies in case of recurrent CNV that approaches the FAZ. Since the benefit in treating juxtafoveal CNVs such as those in <LINK REF="STD-MPS-Krypton-Juxta" TYPE="STUDY">MPS Krypton Juxta</LINK> or new subfoveal lesions such as in <LINK REF="STD-MPS-Subf.-New" TYPE="STUDY">MPS Subf. New</LINK> is delayed and could actually be very limited, PDT and antiangiogenic therapy might be preferred because the risk of iatrogenic scotoma is very low. However, no trials comparing photocoagulation to pharmacological therapies for juxtafoveal and subfoveal CNV were found in this review and therefore no evidence-based recommendation can be made. Since our search strategy specified photocoagulation as an intervention but did not define any comparator, we would expect that studies comparing it with drugs would be found if included in the resources searched.</P>

<I>Perifoveal photocoagulation of subfoveal CNV<BR/>
</I>
</B>Laser photocoagulation of the border of the CNV with foveal sparing was proposed in <LINK REF="STD-Coscas-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Coscas 1991</LINK>. The results of this study suggested a benefit, but a statistically significant effect was found at two years but not at one year and three years. The sample size of this study was not large and the potential benefit with this technique cannot be confirmed by this study.<BR/>
<B>
<I>
<BR/>Grid photocoagulation of subfoveal CNV<BR/>
</I>
</B>The pooled estimate from three small or relatively small studies (<LINK REF="STD-Arnold-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Arnold 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bressler-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Bressler 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cardillo-P.-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Cardillo P. 1993</LINK>) did not suggest a benefit with different types of grid photocoagulation to the CNV area or around it. Furthermore, they suggested some harm at three months and therefore its use is not recommended.</P>
<P>
<B>
<I>Photocoagulation versus submacular surgery for recurrent subfoveal CNV</I>
</B>
<BR/>One pilot study (<LINK REF="STD-SST-2000" TYPE="STUDY">SST 2000</LINK>) did not suggest that photocoagulation was significantly better than submacular surgery for recurrent subfoveal CNV. Nonetheless, comparisons at various points of follow up were in favour of photocoagulation, suggesting that further research is not needed.<BR/>
<B>
<I>
<BR/>Argon versus krypton lasers<BR/>
</I>
</B>There was no suggestion of superiority of argon or krypton photocoagulation for extrafoveal (<LINK REF="STD-Canadian-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Canadian 1993</LINK>) or subfoveal (<LINK REF="STD-MPS-Subf.-New" TYPE="STUDY">MPS Subf. New</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MPS-Subf.-Recurrent" TYPE="STUDY">MPS Subf. Recurrent</LINK>) CNV. Again, the estimate of the difference between these wavelengths was imprecise and could not rule out meaningful differences. In fact, the largest risk difference allowed by the confidence intervals was about 20% in favour of argon, which is close to the advantage found for argon photocoagulation compared to observation in <LINK REF="STD-MPS-Argon-Extra" TYPE="STUDY">MPS Argon Extra</LINK>. Therefore, <LINK REF="STD-Canadian-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Canadian 1993</LINK> is not sufficient to prove the equivalence of the two wavelengths.</P>

<I>Economic evaluation<BR/>
</I>
</B>
<LINK REF="REF-Busbee-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Busbee 2003</LINK> conducted a cost-utility analysis of photocoagulation of extrafoveal CNV based on <LINK REF="STD-MPS-Argon-Extra" TYPE="STUDY">MPS Argon Extra</LINK> data. They assumed that the utility for one individual was determined by the visual acuity of the better eyes, so that photocoagulation gave no benefit until the second eye became affected. The baseline percentage of eyes with unilateral disease (59%) in the Markov model was also derived from <LINK REF="STD-MPS-Argon-Extra" TYPE="STUDY">MPS Argon Extra</LINK>. The study used a five-year perspective. The cost-utility of photocoagulation (in US dollars) was $23,176 per quality adjusted life year (QALY) saved in 2001, with an upper estimate in sensitivity analyses of $49,766 per QALY. <LINK REF="REF-Brown-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brown 2000</LINK> used a design similar to <LINK REF="REF-Busbee-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Busbee 2003</LINK> to estimate the cost-utility of photocoagulation of subfoveal CNV based on <LINK REF="STD-MPS-Subf.-New" TYPE="STUDY">MPS Subf. New</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-MPS-Subf.-Recurrent" TYPE="STUDY">MPS Subf. Recurrent</LINK> with a perspective of four years. The cost-utility of photocoagulation (in US dollars) was $4974 per QALY saved, with an upper limit in sensitivity analyses of $11,633. These studies suggest that laser photocoagulation is a cost-effective treatment.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>Laser photocoagulation of extrafoveal CNV is an effective and economical method to try to halt visual loss in patients with extrafoveal well-defined CNV in AMD. The benefits of photocoagulation are limited or delayed for juxtafoveal and subfoveal lesions. Among the latter, they are larger for recurrent lesions. If laser is chosen for subfoveal CNV the patient should be informed about the high risk of early visual loss. Patients should be informed that no studies can be found that compare photocoagulation with modern pharmacological agents for AMD.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Laser photocoagulation should be preferred to observation as a control group in any study of new treatments for extrafoveal and juxtafoveal CNV. </P>
