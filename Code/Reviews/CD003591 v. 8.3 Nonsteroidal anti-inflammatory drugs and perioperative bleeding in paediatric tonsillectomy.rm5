<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2013-07-02 10:55:51 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are used for pain relief following tonsillectomy in children. Bleeding is a recognized complication of this procedure and NSAIDs can interfere with blood clotting, so there has been concern that these drugs will increase the risk of bleeding. If bleeding is severe this may result in the child being re-admitted to hospital, having a blood transfusion or returning to theatre. It was therefore important to establish whether these drugs are safe to use in children having their tonsils out. The review focused on clinically significant bleeding that results in the child requiring additional treatment rather than the measured blood loss. We also wanted to establish whether NSAIDs affect the incidence of other postoperative complications such as nausea and vomiting when compared to other forms of analgesia. Additionally we aimed to investigate whether different types of NSAIDs were more likely to lead to bleeding. </P>
<P>The main limitation of our updated review was that bleeding following tonsillectomy is an uncommon event (occurring in 3% to 5% of children). We found all the data from randomized controlled trials that are currently available (15 trials studying approximately 1000 children). Our results were consistent with both an increased and decreased risk of bleeding. There were insufficient data to compare the risk of bleeding with each individual type of NSAID. However, we were able to compare ketorolac, which has been perceived as having a greater risk of bleeding, with the other NSAIDs and found no increased risk of bleeding. There was less nausea and vomiting when NSAIDs were used as part of the pain relief regime than when NSAIDs were not used.</P>
<P>There is insufficient evidence to exclude an increased risk of bleeding when NSAIDs are used in paediatric tonsillectomy. They do, however, confer the benefit of a reduction in vomiting.</P>

<P>We included 15 studies that involved 1101 children in this updated review. One study was added as a result of our 2012 search, another previously included study was removed due to lack of randomization. Fourteen included studies compared NSAIDs with other analgesics or placebo and reported on bleeding requiring surgical intervention. The use of NSAIDs was associated with a non-significant increase in the risk of bleeding requiring surgical intervention: Peto odds ratio (OR) 1.69 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.71 to 4.01). Ten studies involving 365 children reported perioperative bleeding requiring non-surgical intervention. NSAIDs did not significantly alter the number of perioperative bleeding events requiring non-surgical intervention: Peto OR 0.99 (95% CI 0.41 to 2.40) but the confidence intervals did not exclude an increased risk. Thirteen studies involving 1021 children reported postoperative vomiting. There was less vomiting when NSAIDs were used as part of the analgesic regime than when NSAIDs were not used: Mantel Haenszel (M-H) risk ratio (RR) 0.72 (95% CI 0.61 to 0.85).</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2013-07-01 13:53:55 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2013-06-30 12:33:09 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>Tonsillectomy is one of the most common surgical procedures for children, both in the UK and globally. The most recent figures are set at over 45,000 tonsillectomies per year in the UK<B>
<I> </I>
</B>(<A HREF="http://www.hesonline.nhs.uk">www.hesonline.nhs.uk</A>).<B>
<I> </I>
</B>Indications for tonsillectomy are recurrent throat infections, recurrent tonsillitis, peritonsillar abscess or obstructive sleep apnoea.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2013-06-30 12:35:42 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>Effective pain relief is important for the management of the paediatric tonsillectomy patient and opioid analgesics are often selected for this purpose. However, opioids may increase the occurrence of nausea and vomiting, respiratory depression and excessive sedation, and urinary retention.</P>
<P>Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are also<B>
<I> </I>
</B>used for pain relief following tonsillectomy in children. They are proven analgesics (<LINK REF="REF-Langford-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Langford 2006</LINK>) and reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Kokki-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kokki 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Romsing-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Romsing 1997</LINK>) have shown that they are effective in the management of mild to moderate postoperative pain in children. NSAIDs may also reduce postoperative nausea and vomiting (<LINK REF="STD-_x00d6_ztekin-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Öztekin 2002</LINK>) as well as the time to adequate oral intake and time to discharge (<LINK REF="STD-Tawalbeh-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Tawalbeh 2001</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2013-06-30 12:53:52 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>NSAIDs work by interfering with cyclo-oxygenase, which reduces the production of prostaglandins leading to a reduction in swelling and pain. Used as an alternative to opioids for pain relief they can avoid side effects such as nausea and vomiting, which could make NSAIDs a more suitable choice of analgesic for the paediatric tonsillectomy patient.</P>
<P>However, NSAIDs also inhibit platelet aggregation and may prolong bleeding time. This potential increased risk of bleeding has been a concern in the postoperative use of NSAIDs.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2013-07-01 13:53:55 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>Bleeding after tonsillectomy is a well recognized and potentially serious complication. Estimates of the incidence of bleeding requiring treatment vary from 2% to 10%, and bleeding requiring re-operation from 1% to 5.5%<B>
<I> </I>
</B>(<LINK REF="REF-Marret-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marret 2003</LINK>). This has raised concerns that NSAID use may lead to increased perioperative bleeding following tonsillectomy and concerns about increased rates of primary haemorrhage (bleeding within 24 hours of surgery) that may require operative intervention.</P>
<P>Two meta-analyses (<LINK REF="REF-Marret-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marret 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moiniche-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moiniche 2003</LINK>) reviewed the use of NSAIDs and the risk of bleeding after tonsillectomy in both adult and paediatric patients. Marret et al concluded that NSAIDs increased the risk of re-operation for haemostasis after tonsillectomy but Moiniche et al concluded that NSAIDs should be used cautiously until further data were available.</P>
<P>Our original review (<LINK REF="REF-Cardwell-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cardwell 2005</LINK>) concluded that there is currently no evidence that using NSAIDs caused any statistically significant increase in bleeding requiring further clinical intervention. However, as bleeding requiring further surgical intervention following tonsillectomy is an uncommon event (<LINK REF="REF-Collison-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Collison 2000</LINK>), a large number of participants are required to provide an adequate number of events to give a significant result. The numbers required are increased further because this is a non-inferiority research question, with the aim being to show that the NSAIDs are not worse than other analgesic methods. It remains unknown whether the various NSAIDs may have different tendencies to cause bleeding following tonsillectomy in children.</P>

<P>We included studies in which patients had been given NSAIDs compared to either a placebo or other analgesics. NSAIDS could have been given pre-, intra- or postoperatively and by any route. Doses prescribed were on a mg/kg basis, as recommended by the British National Formulary (<LINK REF="REF-BNF-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">BNF 2010</LINK>). We excluded any trials that included aspirin as aspirin is no longer recommended for use in children. We did not include the cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors because these are known to have no effect on platelets (<LINK REF="REF-Meade-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meade 1993</LINK>).

In the majority of papers postoperative nausea and vomiting were measured as the number of patients having at least one emetic episode, although vomiting is unlikely to occur without nausea. Some papers (<LINK REF="STD-Kokki-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Kokki 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-_x00d6_ztekin-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Öztekin 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rawlinson-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Rawlinson 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-St-Charles-1997" TYPE="STUDY">St Charles 1997</LINK>) attempted to separate nausea and vomiting, with nausea being measured by nurse questioning or observation, or discussion with the primary care giver. In the interests of clarity we changed our third outcome measure to 'vomiting'.</P>
<P>The outcome measure of increased hospital stay was not specifically reported, although it is implied by the need for further intervention. Our pain data were not fully comprehensive as we only included those papers that had bleeding as an outcome. Also, pain was measured in a variety of different ways making direct comparisons impossible. There is already good evidence (<LINK REF="REF-Kokki-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kokki 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Romsing-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Romsing 1997</LINK>) to show that NSAIDs provide good postoperative analgesia. After discussion with the Cochrane Anaesthesia Review Group we decided to exclude pain from our results and focus this meta-analysis on the risk of bleeding associated with the use of NSAIDs in paediatric tonsillectomy. Other side effects of NSAIDs were not mentioned in any of the included trials.</P>
<P>Therefore, our revised outcome measures were the following.</P>

<P>In the papers we identified with respect to the different NSAIDs, we were unable to perform subgroup analysis on all the individual NSAIDs as there were insufficient trials to do this.

<P>In the 2012 update we performed a subgroup analysis based on whether the intervention was administered pre- or postoperatively.

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-07-01 11:41:08 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The focus of our review was clinically relevant outcomes that affect patients, and to investigate whether there was an increased risk of bleeding associated with the use of NSAIDS at the time of paediatric tonsillectomy. Our first outcome was bleeding requiring surgical intervention and our results are consistent with both a decreased and an increased risk of bleeding in the intervention group. Our second outcome was bleeding requiring non-surgical intervention. This included methods of non<B>
<I>-</I>
</B>surgical haemostasis, intravenous fluid therapy and increased hospital stay.</P>
<P>As for bleeding requiring further surgical intervention, our results do not exclude an increased risk of bleeding associated with NSAID use. We therefore cannot draw any conclusions about the effect of NSAIDs on bleeding. Our subgroup analyses suggested an increased risk of bleeding requiring surgical intervention with ketorolac but the statistical test for differences between subgroups was not significant and this pattern was not seen with Outcome 2, bleeding requiring non-surgical intervention. There was some evidence of a difference in Outcome 2 with an increased risk of bleeding for those studies comparing NSAIDs against a placebo, rather than another analgesic treatment, but again this difference was not significant.</P>
<P>Our third outcome measure was vomiting. Our results suggest that children who receive NSAIDs are 25% less likely to vomit postoperatively than children who did not receive NSAIDs. The difference was statistically significant (P &#8804; 0.001). There are two possible mechanisms for this observed effect, both related to better pain control in the NSAIDs group. Many of the included studies had opioids available as a rescue analgesic. If children on NSAIDs received less opioid analgesic due to better pain control, this might explain the reduction in vomiting since opioids are known to lead to nausea and vomiting. If an opioid-sparing effect is assumed then in those studies in which less rescue analgesic was given to the intervention group the results would show a larger reduction in vomiting. Our sensitivity analysis showed no difference in the results when studies were removed in which less rescue analgesic was given.</P>
<P>Apart from an opioid-sparing mechanism, it is also possible that the reduction in vomiting seen in the NSAID group could be explained by a reduction in pain for those patients in the intervention group, since pain can lead to vomiting and nausea. We did not consider pain in this review due to the differences in reporting between studies, and therefore we were unable to consider a possible correlation between vomiting and pain.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2013-07-02 10:50:17 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The objective of our review was to assess the effects of NSAIDs on bleeding with paediatric tonsillectomy. We were able to identify 15 studies with 1101 patients undergoing tonsillectomy surgery from our searches. All of these studies compared the use of NSAIDs with either another analgesic or a placebo. Bleeding, either requiring surgical or non-surgical intervention, was considered as an outcome in all the studies.</P>
<P>Bleeding requiring further surgical intervention is an uncommon event following tonsillectomy. Assessing the pooled numerical values for the number of events, we have approximately 500 patients in each group and only a very small number of bleeding events. The results of the pooled data, shown on the forest plot in <LINK REF="FIG-04" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 4</LINK>, showed no statistically significant increase in bleeding. However, power calculations indicated that 1469 patients in each group would be needed to detect a risk ratio of 1.5, a 5% assumed risk of bleeding in the control group and a 7.5% assumed risk in the NSAID group, with 80% power (&#945; 0.05, two-tailed). Since this a non-inferiority research question, perhaps the more relevant power calculation is to exclude a 2.5% difference in bleeding with a one-sided &#945; 0.025 and this would require 1194 patients in each group. This review, therefore, had insufficient numbers to be able to exclude an increased risk of bleeding associated with the use of NSAIDs in paediatric tonsillectomy.</P>
<P>We considered whether NSAIDs affect the incidence of postoperative vomiting, and 13 of our included studies reported on this outcome. Postoperative nausea and vomiting is a much more common event and this was reflected in our results. Again we had approximately 500 patients in each group and our results demonstrated a significant reduction in the risk of vomiting for the NSAIDs group. Power calculations for this outcome indicated that 354 patients in each group would be needed to detect a risk ratio of 0.75, a 40% assumed risk of vomiting in the control group and a 30% risk of bleeding in the NSAIDs group, with a power of 80% (&#945; 0.05, two-tailed). This review, therefore, had sufficient numbers to potentially demonstrate that the use of NSAIDs for paediatric tonsillectomy reduces the risk of vomiting.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2013-07-02 10:50:17 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We considered the quality of the studies using the 'Risk of bias' assessment tools. There were no studies that had a low risk of bias in all the domains, however our sensitivity analysis suggested that these biases did not affect the overall result. A funnel plot (see <LINK REF="FIG-05" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 5</LINK>) suggests an absence of bias across 10 included studies for our first comparison (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>). No outcome was graded down for quality in the 'Summary of findings' table.</P>
<P>The included studies date back to 1995 and we considered the directness of evidence and whether the interventions tested were still clinically relevant. Three papers studied ibuprofen (<LINK REF="STD-Harley-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Harley 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pickering-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Pickering 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-St-Charles-1997" TYPE="STUDY">St Charles 1997</LINK>) but used doses of 5 mg/kg. However, ibuprofen is now prescribed to children in a dose of 10 mg/kg so the doses studied are half that now given, which may have an effect on the potential to cause bleeding.</P>
<P>Another study (<LINK REF="STD-Thiagarajan-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Thiagarajan 1993</LINK>) used papaveretum as the comparison drug, which is no longer commonly used for children. Five studies (<LINK REF="STD-Rawlinson-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Rawlinson 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Splinter-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Splinter 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sutherland-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Sutherland 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sutters-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Sutters 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Thiagarajan-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Thiagarajan 1993</LINK>) administered either the intervention or comparison drug, or both, intramuscularly, which is also no longer commonly used for children. However, these are not variables that are likely to affect the results and we did not downgrade the evidence for indirectness.</P>

<P>This review considered studies of paediatric tonsillectomy patients. Although we attempted to account for different surgery types and to aim for balance, it must be acknowledged that some patients also underwent additional surgeries (commonly adenoidectomy) and this could have potentially affected the bleeding outcomes. We attempted to address this in the sensitivity analysis. There were also different surgical techniques used between studies, as well as different anaesthetics, which we did not consider in our subgroup analysis. These differing techniques and drugs could affect bleeding outcomes.</P>
<P>We also did not consider age or gender in our review, for which there may be risks associated with postoperative haemorrhage (<LINK REF="REF-Tomkinson-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tomkinson 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>For our analysis we combined studies comparing different NSAIDs (ketorolac, ibuprofen, diclofenac, ketoprofen and tenoxicam) against different controls (placebo, morphine, fentanyl, codeine, acetominophen, tramadol and papaveretum). We considered subgroup analysis according to the intervention drug but we were only able to consider ketorolac for subgroup analysis. Within this subgroup ketorolac was considered against a variety of controls. The intervention and control drugs were also given by different routes (intravenously, intramuscularly or orally).</P>
<P>Our second subgroup analysis considered the timing of administration of the intervention drug. We were unable to perform this meta-analysis using data within study populations as there were only two studies for which this would have been possible. We chose to combine the data between those studies in which the intervention drug was given preoperatively and those studies in which it was given postoperatively. The differences between estimates may therefore be due to differences in the study populations or trial design, unrelated to timing of NSAID administration. However, we did not find any differences between the timing subgroups.</P>
<P>We limited our included study eligibility criteria to those studies which reported on perioperative bleeding requiring surgical or non-surgical interventions, as justified by our main objective to consider the effect of NSAIDs on bleeding. However, this meant that some studies were excluded from our review which could have potentially been included in our meta-analysis of the effect of NSAIDs on the incidence of vomiting. We did not include a measure of millilitres of blood as this was less relevant in paediatric cases. However, there were studies that measured such intraoperative blood loss and our definitions of perioperative bleeding requiring surgical or non-surgical bleeding did not allow for this. Our review did not, therefore, consider whether there may be a difference in the amount of bleeding that is subclinical.</P>

<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2013-07-01 12:04:32 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two meta-analyses (<LINK REF="REF-Marret-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marret 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moiniche-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moiniche 2003</LINK>) reviewed the use of NSAIDs and the risk of bleeding after tonsillectomy in both adult and paediatric patients. Marret et al concluded that NSAIDs increase the risk of re-operation for haemostasis after tonsillectomy. Moiniche et al concluded that NSAIDs should be used cautiously until further data are available.</P>
<P>The first review (<LINK REF="REF-Marret-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marret 2003</LINK>) studied paediatric and adult data but only included trials published in English. The paper has not been updated. Our review includes a further two papers which have been published since that review. The outcome measures in that review were the need for surgical electrocautery to stop the bleeding and postoperative bleeding requiring a change in postoperative management. The primary outcome, which required a return to theatre, was different from ours; and the need for surgical electrocautery probably overestimated the bleeding as this can be part of the primary surgical procedure. The papers included in the review were not exactly the same as ours as the review included two that only studied adult participants and the review did not include eight papers which we included. It is unclear from the review why these were not included but three papers (<LINK REF="STD-Kokki-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Kokki 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-_x00d6_ztekin-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Öztekin 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pickering-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Pickering 2002</LINK>) do not appear to have been reviewed at all as they are not mentioned or referenced. We considered all three of these studies to be of sufficient quality to include in our review.</P>
<P>In the second review (<LINK REF="REF-Moiniche-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moiniche 2003</LINK>) the papers reviewed were similar to ours except adult studies were also included and no papers published after December 2001 were included. The significance of their results was dependent on the method used. They found that re-operation because of bleeding occurred more often with NSAIDs. The Peto OR was statistically significant (Peto OR 2.33, 95% CI 1.12 to 4.83) and was of borderline significance using the method described by Shadish and Haddock (<LINK REF="REF-Sadish-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sadish 1994</LINK>) (OR 1.92, 95% CI 1.00 to 3.71); the NNT was 60 (95% CI 34 to 277). However, they did not find interoperative blood loss, postoperative blood loss or hospital admission to be more common with NSAIDs and therefore concluded that NSAIDs could be used cautiously until further data became available.</P>
<P>A Cochrane systematic review (<LINK REF="REF-Standing-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Standing 2009</LINK>) considered diclofenac for acute pain in children (perioperative pain, migraine, renal colic and soft tissue injury and fractures). This paper included two studies from our review (<LINK REF="STD-_x00d6_ztekin-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Öztekin 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Thiagarajan-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Thiagarajan 1993</LINK>) and included outcomes of bleeding requiring surgical intervention and nausea or vomiting, or both. The authors concluded that diclofenac did not appear to increase the incidence of perioperative bleeding (Mantel-Haenzel RR 1.25, 95% CI 0.31 to 4.97). They also conclude that there is a reduction in nausea and vomiting (Mantel-Haenzel RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.47 to 0.73).</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2013-07-01 12:07:07 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The objective of this review was to assess the effects of NSAIDs on bleeding with paediatric tonsillectomy. From the data available to date, there is no evidence that using NSAIDs caused any statistically significant increase in bleeding that required further clinical intervention. Bleeding requiring further surgical intervention is an uncommon event following tonsillectomy. Although not statistically significant, our results showed an increased risk of bleeding requiring surgical intervention with a large confidence interval (95% CI 0.71 to 4.01). This indicates that the total number of participants studied is inadequate and further studies need to be performed. This is also shown in our power calculations. This limitation of our original review remains as only one paper was added to this updated review. There was less vomiting when NSAIDs were used as part of the analgesic regime compared to when NSAIDs were not used.</P>
<P>We therefore conclude that there is insufficient evidence to exclude an increased risk of bleeding when NSAIDs are used in paediatric tonsillectomy. They do, however, confer the benefit of a reduction in vomiting.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2013-07-01 12:10:47 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Further studies are required assessing the impact of NSAIDs on bleeding in paediatric tonsillectomy. Future studies should be sufficiently powered to consider the relatively uncommon risk of bleeding. They should be sufficiently blinded and avoid the bias introduced by opioid rescue analgesics, different surgical techniques and surgeries in addition to tonsillectomy. Stratifying by age and gender would also be considered for this potential difference in bleeding outcomes.</P>
<P>Currently none of the selective COX-2 inhibitors are approved for use in children and there remains limited information to support their use in treating pain following paediatric tonsillectomy. This would be a further potential topic for research in this field.</P>

<P>In our protocol, we stated that if there were enough data we would create subgroups for individual drugs. After our search, we found that we had inadequate numbers of papers to do this for all the NSAIDs. However, we were able to do this for ketorolac.</P>
<P>In the 2012 update we renamed the original outcomes. In particular the second outcome was changed from 'bleeding not requiring surgical intervention' to 'perioperative bleeding requiring non-surgical intervention'. Although we considered the same types of examples given in the original protocol (intravenous fluid therapy, prolonged observation and non-surgical haemostasis), this change in the wording improved clarity for data extraction purposes. We also changed the third outcome to only include reported data on vomiting and added the time to event as within 24 hours.</P>
