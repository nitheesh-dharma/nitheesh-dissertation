<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2011-05-12 13:19:56 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Dimitrinka Nikolova">
<P>The majority of liver diseases are caused by alcohol in the Western world. Propylthiouracil - an antithyroid drug that is used for patients with raised metabolism - has been suggested as a potential treatment for alcoholic liver disease. Six randomised clinical trials with a total of 710 patients were included in this systematic review. The trials were generally with high risk of bias. We could not demonstrate any significant effect of propylthiouracil on all-cause mortality, liver-related mortality, liver complications, or liver histology of patients with alcoholic liver disease. Although propylthiouracil was not associated with a significant increased risk of non-serious adverse events, there were occasional instances of serious adverse events (leukopenia, generalized bullous eruption). The trials included a small number of patients, and so, the risk of random error (error due to play of chance) is high. There seems to be no evidence for using propylthiouracil for alcoholic liver disease outside randomised clinical trials.</P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2011-05-12 13:29:48 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Dimitrinka Nikolova">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2011-05-12 10:25:42 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Dimitrinka Nikolova">
<P>Liver fibrosis and liver cirrhosis are common reactions to a number of hepatotoxic substances, hepatotropic viruses, autoimmune liver diseases, metabolic liver diseases, etc. Alcohol and hepatotropic viruses are the cause of the majority of liver fibrosis and cirrhosis in the Western world. For example, the attributable risk for symptomatic liver cirrhosis in Italy explained by alcohol consumption, hepatitis B virus, and hepatitis C virus was 98.1% in men and 67.0% in women (<LINK REF="REF-Corrao-1998a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Corrao 1998a</LINK>).</P>
<P>Alcohol is a major hepatotoxin (<LINK REF="REF-Morgan-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morgan 1999</LINK>). Alcohol leads to fatty liver (<LINK REF="REF-Rubin-1968" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rubin 1968</LINK>), alcoholic hepatitis, fibrosis, and cirrhosis (<LINK REF="REF-Morgan-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morgan 1999</LINK>). Alcoholic hepatitis is associated with peripheral leukocytosis and marked hepatic portal and parenchymal inflammatory infiltration predominantly by neutrophils (<LINK REF="REF-Hill-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hill 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sheron-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sheron 1993</LINK>). Data from long-term studies in which patients with alcoholic fatty change and alcoholic hepatitis were followed for up to 13 years demonstrates that alcoholic hepatitis is a predictor of a later development of liver fibrosis and cirrhosis (<LINK REF="REF-S_x00f8_rensen-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sørensen 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Marbet-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marbet 1987</LINK>). Alcohol-induced necrosis and inflammation may trigger the scarring and the development of fibrosis, and later on of the development of cirrhosis. In fact, about 70% of patients with clinical alcoholic hepatitis also have alcoholic cirrhosis at the time of diagnosis (<LINK REF="REF-Mendenhall-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mendenhall 1984</LINK>). Five-year survival rates in patients with alcoholic cirrhosis who stop drinking are of order of 50% to 75%; whereas survival rates in patients continuing to drink rarely exceed 40% (<LINK REF="REF-Powell-1968" TYPE="REFERENCE">Powell 1968</LINK>). The progression of liver fibrosis and cirrhosis in patients with alcohol problems is enhanced by the presence of hepatitis B and hepatitis C virus markers (<LINK REF="REF-Chang-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chang 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Corrao-1998b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Corrao 1998b</LINK>).</P>
<P>Propylthiouracil (PTU) may reduce alcohol induced hepatocyte damage by acting as an antioxidant (<LINK REF="REF-Hicks-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hicks 1992</LINK>) and suppressing alcohol induced hepatic necrosis (<LINK REF="REF-Israel-1975a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Israel 1975a</LINK>). Studies have found a 'hypermetabolic state', with an increase in hepatic oxygen consumption in rats chronically treated with alcohol (<LINK REF="REF-Israel-1975a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Israel 1975a</LINK>) as well as in alcoholic patients (<LINK REF="REF-Iturriaga-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Iturriaga 1980</LINK>). PTU, an antithyroid drug (<LINK REF="REF-Kampmann-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kampmann 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Klein-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Klein 1994</LINK>), reacts with some of the oxidizing species derived from the respiratory burst in neutrophils (<LINK REF="REF-Imamura-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Imamura 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Carmichael-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carmichael 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ross-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ross 1998</LINK>). PTU protects rat liver and isolated hepatocytes from ischaemic damage (<LINK REF="REF-Israel-1975b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Israel 1975b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Younes-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Younes 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gonzalez_x002d_Reimers1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gonzalez-Reimers1988</LINK>). Therefore, PTU could slow the progression of alcoholic liver disease.</P>
<P>Several randomised clinical trials have addressed the question whether PTU has any efficacy in patients with alcoholic liver disease. The results of these trials have been contradictory (<LINK REF="REF-Orrego-1979a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Orrego 1979a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hall_x00e9_-1982a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hallé 1982a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Orrego-1987a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Orrego 1987a</LINK>). Some investigators found beneficial effects of PTU on all-cause mortality, complications, and biochemistry (<LINK REF="REF-Orrego-1979a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Orrego 1979a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Orrego-1987a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Orrego 1987a</LINK>). Others found no significant effect on all-cause mortality (<LINK REF="REF-Hall_x00e9_-1982a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hallé 1982a</LINK>). Based on a questionnaire survey among European hospital-based specialists in gastroenterology/hepatology, 15% of the specialists considered using PTU for alcoholic hepatitis (<LINK REF="REF-Gluud-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gluud 1993</LINK>). The present systematic review examines the beneficial and harmful effects of PTU for alcoholic liver disease.</P>

<BR/>The risk of bias in the randomised clinical trials was assessed using generation of allocation sequence, allocation concealment, blinding, incomplete outcome data, selective outcome reporting, baseline imbalance, early stopping, academic bias, source of funding (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moher-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kjaergard-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kjaergard 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wood-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wood 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gurusamy-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gurusamy 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gluud-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gluud 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>).

<P>We classified trials as trials with low risk of bias if they were judged with low risk of bias in all the above domains. Otherwise, the trials were classified as trials with high risk of bias.<BR/> <B>
<BR/>Statistical methods<BR/>
</B>All analyses were performed according to the intention-to-treat method including all randomised patients. Patients without the outcome variable were included in two analyses; one in which patients without the outcome were considered as failures, and one in which patients without the outcome were considered as successes.</P>
<P>The statistical package Review Manager provided by The Cochrane Collaboration was used (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2011</LINK>). For all analyses we used both random-effects (<LINK REF="REF-DerSimonian-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">DerSimonian 1986</LINK>) and fixed-effect (<LINK REF="REF-DeMets-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">DeMets 1987</LINK>) models. In case of discrepancy between the two models (one showing a significant intervention effect and the other no significant intervention effect) we reported both results. Otherwise, we reported only the results from the fixed-effect model. Discrepancy only occurred when there was heterogeneity (please see below). In case of discrepancy between the two models, we put most weight on the results of the fixed-effect model if the meta-analysis included one or more large trials with adequate methodology. Large trials were defined as trials that included more than half of all included events and participants in the meta-analysis. Otherwise, we put most weight on the random-effects model. The reason for this is that the random-effects model puts more weight on small trials. Small trials are more often than large trials conducted with unclear or inadequate methods (<LINK REF="REF-Kjaergard-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kjaergard 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>Dichotomous data were analysed by calculating the relative risks (RR) and continuous outcomes as mean difference (MD) both with 95% confidence intervals.</P>
<P>We conducted trial sequential analysis in order to estimate how far we had come in our development of the cumulative evidence (<LINK REF="REF-Wetterslev-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wetterslev 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Thorlund-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thorlund 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Brok-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brok 2009</LINK>). We based our trial sequential analysis on all-cause mortality using an outcome proportion of 15% in the control group; an assumed relative risk reduction of 20%; an alpha of 5%; a beta of 20%; and a heterogeneity correction for the calculation of the required information size (<LINK REF="REF-Wetterslev-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wetterslev 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<B>
<I>Heterogeneity and funnel plot asymmetry<BR/>
</I>
</B>Heterogeneity in the results of the trials was initially assessed by the inspection of graphical presentations and by calculating a test of heterogeneity (Chi-square) as well as level of inconsistency (I<SUP>2</SUP>). We anticipated between-trial variation in estimation of morbidity and all-cause mortality for those patients who presented with advanced liver disease (<LINK REF="REF-DerSimonian-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">DerSimonian 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-DeMets-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">DeMets 1987</LINK>). Subgroup analyses were performed in order to assess the impact of these possible sources of heterogeneity on the main results.</P>
<P>Potential causes for heterogeneity were explored by performing sensitivity analyses. We performed sensitivity analyses with regard to methodological quality of included randomised clinical trials (analysing separately randomised clinical trials with adequate quality components, ie, low risk of bias, and inadequate quality components, high risk of bias, and duration of treatment. We also planned analyses regarding way of administration of PTU as well as preparation and dose of PTU, but all trials used per oral PTU 300 mg per day.</P>
<P>Due to the risk of chance statistical findings, such findings were interpreted conservatively.</P>
<P>Potential publication bias (<LINK REF="REF-Vickers-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vickers 1998</LINK>) and other sources of bias were planned to be investigated by funnel plots (<LINK REF="REF-Egger-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Egger 1997</LINK>), but due to the few randomised clinical trials identified, we did not perform such analyses.</P>

<P>
<B>All-cause mortality</B>
<BR/>Combining the results of the six randomised clinical trials demonstrated no significant effect of PTU versus placebo on all-cause mortality (risk ratio (RR) 0.93, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.66 to 1.30). In the PTU group, 50/353 (14.2%) patients died versus 54/357 (15.1%) patients in the placebo group (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>).</P>
<P>Sensitivity analysis stratifying the randomised clinical trials according to the risk of bias in the trials (trials at low risk of bias versus high risk of bias for each domain, excluding the report 'free of source of funding' which was unclear in all trials) did not demonstrate differences regarding the intervention efficacy of PTU on all-cause mortality between randomised clinical trials at low risk versus high risk of bias (<LINK REF="CMP-003.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.1</LINK>).</P>
<P>Sensitivity analysis stratifying the randomised clinical trials according to the duration of treatment did not change this estimate significantly. The RR of death of the randomised trials with a short-term treatment (within 46 days) was 1.19 (95% CI 0.78 to 1.81) and the RR of the randomised trial with a treatment duration of 24 months was 0.63 (95% CI 0.35 to 1.13) (<LINK REF="CMP-003.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.2</LINK>). Stratifying the randomised clinical trials according to a worst-best case scenario analysis (all patients who dropped-out or were withdrawn were considered dead), or a per-protocol analysis did not change this estimate significantly (<LINK REF="CMP-003.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.3</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-003.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.4</LINK>).</P>
<P>Trial sequential analysis based on a heterogeneity-corrected information size of 4908 patients shows that with only 706 patients randomised, we are still very early in the development of evidence regarding this intervention (<LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>).</P>

<B>Liver-related mortality</B>
<BR/>Combining the results of four randomised clinical trials, which provided data on liver mortality, showed no significant effect of PTU versus placebo on this outcome (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.40) (<LINK REF="STD-Orrego-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Orrego 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hall_x00e9_-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Hallé 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Orrego-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Orrego 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rodriguez-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Rodriguez 1993</LINK>).

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2011-05-12 13:21:48 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Dimitrinka Nikolova">
<P>We could not demonstrate any significant effects of PTU on all-cause mortality, liver-related mortality, and liver complications when tested against placebo in patients with alcoholic liver disease. However, absence of evidence is not evidence of absence of effect.</P>
<P>The lack of effect of PTU on all-cause mortality was robust to sensitivity analyses taking the risk of bias in the randomised clinical trials into consideration. The sensitivity analyses contrasting trials of low risk of bias versus trials of high risk of bias as judged by the single domain did not reveal any significant influence on the RR of all-cause mortality. This is in contrast to studies examining the association between intervention effects and risk of bias of randomised clinical trials (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moher-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kjaergard-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kjaergard 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wood-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wood 2008</LINK>). However, one should notice that two randomised clinical trials at high risk of bias were only reported as abstracts. First, the brevity of abstracts may make it difficult to report the risk of bias in a trial in sufficient detail. Second, the association between the risk of bias and intervention effects previously reported rests mainly or exclusively on trials reported as full articles (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moher-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kjaergard-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kjaergard 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wood-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wood 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>Sensitivity analysis taking duration of treatment into consideration showed no significant difference on the RR of all-cause mortality. The worst-best case scenario analysis and the per-protocol analysis did not show any significant effect of PTU on all-cause mortality.</P>
<P>Our trial sequential analysis demonstrates that we are very early in our development of evidence on PTU for all-cause mortality in alcoholic liver disease with only 706 patients randomised. We are still far from obtaining conclusive evidence on the effect of PTU for patients (<LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>).</P>
<P>We were unable to detect any significant influence of PTU on liver histology due to the paucity of data. Only one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Pierrugues-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Pierrugues 1989</LINK>), reported as an abstract, provided data on histological changes (which were similar in PTU and placebo group). In three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Orrego-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Orrego 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hall_x00e9_-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Hallé 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Orrego-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Orrego 1987</LINK>), a liver biopsy was done at the beginning of the trial or at some time after in a subgroup of patients, but no data on liver histology at the end of the follow-up were reported.</P>
<P>Although propylthiouracil was not associated with a significant increased risk of non-serious adverse events, there were occasional instances of serious adverse events: one patient with leukopenia and one patient with generalised bullous eruption, and the latter patient died during the randomised clinical trial. Few patients with PTU induced fulminant hepatitis and a number of adverse events have been reported in the literature during PTU treatment for hyperthyroidism (<LINK REF="REF-Deidiker-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deidiker 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ichiki-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ichiki 1998</LINK>), eg, transient asymptomatic PTU hepatotoxicity occurs in one-third of patients (<LINK REF="REF-Huang-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Huang 1994</LINK>) together with acute cases of interstitial nephritis, vasculitis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and other adverse events (<LINK REF="REF-Dysseleer-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dysseleer 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Morita-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morita 2000</LINK>). Indeed, hypothyroidism was a non-serious adverse event in some patients, and it could have been the reason of some dropouts in the trials (<LINK REF="STD-Hall_x00e9_-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Hallé 1982</LINK>).</P>
<P>The rationale behind PTU for alcoholic liver disease has been said to be via an effect on hepatic oxygen consumption (eg, <LINK REF="REF-Yuki-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yuki 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Carmichael-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carmichael 1993</LINK>). Contrary to observations in normal rats (<LINK REF="REF-Kawasaki-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kawasaki 1989</LINK>), however, PTU 300 mg or 600 mg intravenously were without significant effects on arterial and venous oxygen content in patients with alcoholic cirrhosis with or without alcoholic hepatitis (<LINK REF="STD-Sogni-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Sogni 1997</LINK>). Furthermore, the latter study was unable to demonstrate any effects of PTU on systemic and splanchnic haemodynamics of these patients (<LINK REF="STD-Sogni-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Sogni 1997</LINK>). These findings are contradictory to some extent to the Rojeter et al study (<LINK REF="STD-Rojter-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Rojter 1995</LINK>), which examined haemodynamics measured by the Doppler technique. According to the latter study, PTU administration caused a significant increase in portal blood flow in patients with alcoholic cirrhosis.</P>
<P>We could not demonstrate any significant effect of PTU on any clinically important outcomes of patients with alcoholic liver disease. Accordingly, there seems to be no evidence for using PTU for alcoholic liver disease. The absence of evidence for an effect of PTU on clinically relevant outcome variables, however, does not exclude the possibility that PTU may possess effects. Ioannidis and Lau recently applied 'recursive cumulative meta-analyses' of randomised clinical trials to evaluate the relative change in the pooled treatment effect over time for 60 medical interventions within pregnancy/perinatal medicine and cardiology (<LINK REF="REF-Ioannidis-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ioannidis 2000</LINK>). With 500 accumulated patients, the pooled relative risk may change by about 0.6 to 1.7 fold in the immediate future. When 2000 patients have been randomised, the pooled relative risk may change by 0.7 to 1.3 fold. With only 710 patients with alcoholic liver disease randomised to PTU versus placebo and the wide confidence intervals of the estimates we cannot rule out a potential efficacy of PTU for alcoholic liver disease. However, if clinicians wish to treat patients with alcoholic liver disease with PTU, they must first conduct new randomised clinical trials. Such randomised clinical trials ought to be large, conducted with adequate methodology, the treatment period ought to be several years, and efficacy and harmful effects ought to be closely monitored by an independent data monitoring and safety committee.</P>
<P>A number of medical interventions has been used for alcoholic liver disease (<LINK REF="REF-Gluud-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gluud 1993</LINK>), including colchicine (<LINK REF="REF-Rambaldi-2005a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rambaldi 2005a</LINK>), glucocorticosteroids (<LINK REF="REF-Christensen-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Christensen 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gluud-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gluud 2001</LINK>), anabolic-androgenic steroids (<LINK REF="REF-Gluud-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gluud 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rambaldi-2006a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rambaldi 2006a</LINK>), insulin/glucagon (<LINK REF="REF-Trinchet-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Trinchet 1992</LINK>), milk thistle (<LINK REF="REF-Flora-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Flora 1998</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Rambaldi-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rambaldi 2007</LINK>), parenteral amino acid supplementation (<LINK REF="REF-Mezey-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mezey 1991</LINK>), S-adenosyl-L-methionine (<LINK REF="REF-Mato-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mato 1999</LINK>), and polyenylphosphatidylcholine (<LINK REF="REF-Lieber-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lieber 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lieber-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lieber 2003</LINK>). None of these interventions have been demonstrated effective in systematic reviews of randomised clinical trials. S-adenosyl-L-methionine may be a promising intervention for alcoholic liver disease (<LINK REF="REF-Mato-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mato 1999</LINK>), but more randomised clinical trials are needed before this treatment can be recommended (<LINK REF="REF-Rambaldi-2006b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rambaldi 2006b</LINK>). Pentoxiphylline has only been assessed in one small trial (<LINK REF="REF-Akriviadis-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Akriviadis 2000</LINK>), and liver transplantation has never been assessed in randomised trials. Based on a matched and simulated control study, liver transplantation seems to work for patients with Child-Pugh C class cirrhosis, but not significantly so for Child-Pugh A and B class cirrhosis (<LINK REF="REF-Poynard-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Poynard 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Poynard-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Poynard 1999</LINK>). The results of more randomised clinical trials must be awaited before we may have an efficient medical intervention for alcoholic liver disease.<BR/>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2011-05-12 10:25:42 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Dimitrinka Nikolova">
<P>This systematic review could not demonstrate any significant beneficial effect of PTU on any clinically meaningful outcomes (all-cause mortality, liver-related mortality, and liver complications) of patients with alcoholic liver disease. PTU is associated with serious adverse events. Accordingly, there is no indication for using PTU for alcoholic liver disease outside randomised clinical trials.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>The absence of evidence for an effect of PTU on clinically relevant outcome variables, however, does not exclude the possibility of an effect. If researchers wish to conduct new randomised clinical trials they ought to be large, conducted with adequate methodology, the treatment period ought to be several years, and efficacy and harmful effects ought to be closely monitored by an independent data monitoring and safety committee. Such trials ought to follow the Consolidated Standards for Reporting Trials (CONSORT) Statement (www.consort-statement.org).</P>

<P>A total of 143 patients (69 in the PTU and 74 in placebo group) were included in the trial.</P>
<P>Inclusion criteria: excessive drinking, and well-documented history of spree-drinking. The criteria for diagnosing liver disease required one or more of the following clinical findings: hepatomegaly, tender liver, jaundice, ascites, collateral circulation, spider nevi, and splenomegaly. Further, at least two of the following abnormal laboratory tests were required: s-aspartate aminotransferase, s-alanine aminotransferase, s-gamma glutamyltranspeptidase, s-alkaline phosphatase, s-total bilirubin.<BR/>In 79 patients in whom the prothrombin time permitted, liver biopsies were performed at 7.6 ± 0.1 day after admission. All biopsy specimens were classified in: fatty liver, alcoholic hepatitis, and cirrhosis without hepatitis. The three histologically diagnosed groups were analysed separately.</P>
<P>Exclusion criteria: hypothyroidism; diabetes; other therapies that contraindicated the use of PTU; congestive heart failure.<BR/>The indications for being withdrawn from the study were massive gastrointestinal bleeding, incapacity to ingest drug, leukopenia, or adverse reactions.</P>

<P>A Composite Clinical and Laboratory Index was developed for assessing efficacy. The scoring system was based on the concept that the severity of the disease was proportional to the number of abnormal clinical and laboratory findings. The index included signs and symptoms (hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, ascites, encephalopathy, bleeding tendency, spider naevi, palmar erythema, collateral circulation, peripheral edema, anorexia, and weakness) and laboratory tests (s-bilirubin, prothrombin time, s-albumin, s-gamma glutamyltranspeptidase, s-glutamic oxalacetic transaminase) and depending on the finding, a score (0 to 27) was added for each patient.</P>
