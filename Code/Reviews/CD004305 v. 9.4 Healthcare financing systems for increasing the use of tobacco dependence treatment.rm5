<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2017-09-05 10:17:16 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jonathan Livingstone-Banks">
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>Interventions that reduce or cover the costs of smoking cessation medication and behavioural support could help smokers quit. We reviewed the evidence about the effects of financial interventions directed at smokers and healthcare providers on medication use, quit attempts and successful quitting.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>We searched all relevant studies that involved financial interventions directed at smokers and healthcare providers. For smokers, the aim of the healthcare financing interventions had to be to encourage the use of smoking cessation treatment or making successful quit attempts. For interventions directed at healthcare providers, the intervention had to stimulate the healthcare provider to assist people with quitting smoking, for example by prescribing smoking cessation treatment.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>For the update of this review, we searched studies on the effect of financial interventions on smoking cessation treatment and success in September 2016. We found six new relevant studies, resulting in a total of 17 studies.</P>
<P>We found 15 studies directed at smokers. Covering all the costs of smoking cessation treatment for smokers (free treatment) when compared to providing no financial benefits increased the number of smokers who attempted to quit (4 studies, 9065 participants), used smoking cessation treatments (7 studies, 9455 participants), and succeeded in quitting (6 studies, 9333 participants).</P>
<P>We found three studies directed at healthcare providers. The two studies that investigated the effect of a financial intervention on quit success (2311 participants) did not clearly show an increase in quit rates. Financial interventions directed at healthcare providers also did not have an effect on the use of smoking cessation medication (2 studies, 2311 participants). However, financial interventions did increase the number of smokers who used smoking cessation counselling (3 studies, 25,820 participants).</P>
<P>Information on the costs of the intervention was available for eight studies (33,488 participants). The economic evaluation of the individual studies showed that although the absolute differences in quitting were small, the costs per person successfully quitting were low or moderate.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
</P>
<P>We concluded that financial interventions directed at smokers increase the proportion of smokers who attempt to quit, use smoking cessation treatments, and succeed in quitting. We did not detect a clear effect on smoking cessation from financial incentives directed at healthcare providers. This review has some limitations that affect how confident we can be in the conclusions. The included studies varied substantially in quality and in methods and design, which makes it difficult to compare results.</P>

<ABSTRACT MODIFIED="2017-09-05 13:37:39 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jonathan Livingstone-Banks">
<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2017-09-05 13:37:39 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jonathan Livingstone-Banks">
<P>Tobacco smoking is the leading preventable cause of death worldwide, which makes it essential to stimulate smoking cessation. The financial cost of smoking cessation treatment can act as a barrier to those seeking support. We hypothesised that provision of financial assistance for people trying to quit smoking, or reimbursement of their care providers, could lead to an increased rate of successful quit attempts. This is an update of the original 2005 review.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2017-09-05 10:13:05 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jonathan Livingstone-Banks">
<P>The primary objective of this review was to assess the impact of reducing the costs for tobacco smokers or healthcare providers for using or providing smoking cessation treatment through healthcare financing interventions on abstinence from smoking. The secondary objectives were to examine the effects of different levels of financial support on the use or prescription of smoking cessation treatment, or both, and on the number of smokers making a quit attempt (quitting smoking for at least 24 hours). We also assessed the cost effectiveness of different financial interventions, and analysed the costs per additional quitter, or per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-08-31 16:43:45 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In the current update, we have added six new relevant studies, resulting in a total of 17 studies included in this review involving financial interventions directed at smokers or healthcare providers, or both.</P>
<P>Full financial interventions directed at smokers had a favourable effect on abstinence at six months or longer when compared to no intervention (RR 1.77, 95% CI 1.37 to 2.28, I² = 33%, 9333 participants). There was no evidence that full coverage interventions increased smoking abstinence compared to partial coverage interventions (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.48, I² = 64%, 5914 participants), but partial coverage interventions were more effective in increasing abstinence than no intervention (RR 1.27 95% CI 1.02 to 1.59, I² = 21%, 7108 participants). The economic evaluation showed costs per additional quitter ranging from USD 97 to USD 7646 for the comparison of full coverage with partial or no coverage.</P>
<P>There was no clear evidence of an effect on smoking cessation when we pooled two trials of financial incentives directed at healthcare providers (RR 1.16, CI 0.98 to 1.37, I² = 0%, 2311 participants).</P>
<P>Full financial interventions increased the number of participants making a quit attempt when compared to no interventions (RR 1.11, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.17, I² = 15%, 9065 participants). There was insufficient evidence to show whether partial financial interventions increased quit attempts compared to no interventions (RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.31, I² = 88%, 6944 participants).</P>
<P>Full financial interventions increased the use of smoking cessation treatment compared to no interventions with regard to various pharmacological and behavioural treatments: nicotine replacement therapy (NRT): RR 1.79, 95% CI 1.54 to 2.09, I² = 35%, 9455 participants; bupropion: RR 3.22, 95% CI 1.41 to 7.34, I² = 71%, 6321 participants; behavioural therapy: RR 1.77, 95% CI 1.19 to 2.65, I² = 75%, 9215 participants.</P>
<P>There was evidence that partial coverage compared to no coverage reported a small positive effect on the use of bupropion (RR 1.15, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.29, I² = 0%, 6765 participants). Interventions directed at healthcare providers increased the use of behavioural therapy (RR 1.69, 95% CI 1.01 to 2.86, I² = 85%, 25820 participants), but not the use of NRT and/or bupropion (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.18, I² = 6%, 2311 participants).</P>
<P>We assessed the quality of the evidence for the main outcome, abstinence from smoking, as moderate. In most studies participants were not blinded to the different study arms and researchers were not blinded to the allocated interventions. Furthermore, there was not always sufficient information on attrition rates. We detected some imprecision but we judged this to be of minor consequence on the outcomes of this study.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2017-08-30 09:22:18 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Full financial interventions directed at smokers when compared to no financial interventions increase the proportion of smokers who attempt to quit, use smoking cessation treatments, and succeed in quitting. There was no clear and consistent evidence of an effect on smoking cessation from financial incentives directed at healthcare providers. We are only moderately confident in the effect estimate because there was some risk of bias due to a lack of blinding in participants and researchers, and insufficient information on attrition rates.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2017-08-31 17:15:31 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Tobacco smoking is a major risk factor for non-communicable diseases. A range of interventions such as pharmacotherapy and counselling are currently in use to treat nicotine dependence (<LINK REF="REF-Aveyard-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aveyard 2007</LINK>). Although the majority of smokers attempt to quit unassisted (<LINK REF="REF-Edwards-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Edwards 2014</LINK>), treatments are recommended, as they can increase quit success (<LINK REF="REF-West-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">West 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Aveyard-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aveyard 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nides-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nides 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lancaster-2017" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lancaster 2017</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stead-2017" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stead 2017</LINK>). Existing management strategies for smoking cessation remain limited in effectiveness since a significant majority of smokers attempting to quit either fail to quit or relapse after a successful quit (<LINK REF="REF-Foulds-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Foulds 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mitrouska-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mitrouska 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-West-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">West 2015</LINK>). Apart from counselling and pharmacotherapy, strategies such as financial interventions may be useful to address the problem in a multifaceted manner and increase cessation rates (<LINK REF="STD-Coleman-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Coleman 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Benowitz-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Benowitz 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>Regardless of scientific acceptability, treatment utilisation by smokers and selection of treatment strategies by healthcare providers and insurance companies are influenced by cost considerations, as documented in non-experimental studies (<LINK REF="STD-Cox-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Cox 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gencarelli-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gencarelli 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Briesacher-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Briesacher 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Goto-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goto 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hollenbeck-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hollenbeck 2011</LINK>). As a result, costs and a variety of financial interventions are becoming increasingly important considerations in medical practice to improve patient outcomes and quality of service (<LINK REF="REF-Cheung-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cheung 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Peckham-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Peckham 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Van-Herck-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van Herck 2010</LINK>). For instance, an international survey reported that in several countries a larger proportion of physicians are likely to receive financial incentives based on quality improvement targets: the percentage of physicians provided with incentives was 89% in the UK; 81% in the Netherlands; 70% in Italy; and 65% in Austria (<LINK REF="REF-Schoen-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schoen 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>Despite their popularity, financial interventions are shown to have at best weak or mixed impacts on service quality and patient outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-Steel-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Steel 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Peckham-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Peckham 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-De-Bruin-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">De Bruin 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Flodgren-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Flodgren 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ryan-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ryan 2016</LINK>). In a review of 128 studies that implemented financial incentives in healthcare, Van Herck and colleagues indicated that, for incentive schemes to be effective, they need to be applied to individuals or teams and have prior set targets for quality and patient outcome improvements (<LINK REF="REF-Van-Herck-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van Herck 2010</LINK>). Reviews also indicate that there is little or no information on the cost-effectiveness of these incentives (<LINK REF="REF-Van-Herck-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van Herck 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-De-Bruin-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">De Bruin 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Scott-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scott 2011</LINK>). </P>
<P>According to reports, smoking cessation treatments are highly cost effective compared to other, commonly implemented preventive interventions, such as hypertension and cholesterol-lowering treatments (<LINK REF="REF-Cheung-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cheung 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Parrot-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parrot 2004</LINK>). In a systematic review of the literature, Ronckers and colleagues reported that in spite of lack of standardised reporting by the included studies, smoking cessation treatments aimed at reducing smoking prevalence are cost-effective (<LINK REF="REF-Ronckers-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ronckers 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>In light of limited resources and the increasing cost of health care, it is pertinent to examine the impact of financial interventions provided to smokers and healthcare providers on treatment and process-related outcomes such as smoking cessation service use. We hypothesised that provision of financial assistance for smokers trying to quit, or reimbursement of their healthcare providers, could lead to an increased rate of quit attempts, utilisation of smoking cessation treatments, and successful quitting. This review evaluates financial interventions directed at individual smokers regardless of whether they achieve cessation and also evaluates financial interventions directed at healthcare providers. A separate Cochrane Review evaluates competitions and incentives to reward smokers who achieve cessation or abstinence in smoking cessation schemes (<LINK REF="REF-Cahill-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cahill 2015</LINK>).</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2017-08-30 09:45:50 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The primary objective of this review was to assess the impact of reducing the costs of providing or using smoking cessation treatment by healthcare financing interventions on abstinence from smoking. The secondary objectives were to examine the effects of different levels of financial support on the use or prescription of smoking cessation treatment, or both, and on the number of smokers making a quit attempt (quitting smoking for at least 24 hours). We also assessed the cost effectiveness of different financial interventions, and analysed the costs per additional quitter, or per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained.</P>

<P>We included those studies in which the study population consisted of smokers or healthcare providers. We assessed the primary and secondary objectives from either a smoker&#8217;s or a healthcare provider&#8217;s perspective. For smokers, the aim of the healthcare financing interventions had to be to encourage the use of smoking cessation treatment and successful quit attempts. When the intervention was directed towards healthcare providers, the intervention had to aim to affect the prescribing of smoking cessation treatment or the smoking behaviour of the participants, or both, by offering assistance to quit smoking.</P>
</CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS MODIFIED="2017-08-31 17:17:18 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included trials that studied the effects of healthcare financing interventions directed at smokers or healthcare providers for increasing the use of smoking cessation treatment (e.g. delivered by government, healthcare insurance plans, or other institution-arranged interventions).</P>
<P>We classified patient-centred financial interventions as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Health insurance coverage - changes to the level of benefit available for smoking cessation treatments, including changes to copayment or out-of-pocket payments made by people receiving treatment.</LI>
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>Direct coverage - changes to the direct cost to the smoker of using smoking cessation treatment, for example by provision of a prescription for free pharmacotherapy.</LI>
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>Health insurance cost - changes to the premiums or user fees paid for health insurance.</LI>
</UL>
<P>We defined healthcare provider-centred financing interventions as:     </P>
<UL>
<LI>Salary - payment for a set number of working hours or sessions per time unit.</LI>
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>Capitation - a set amount of payment per patient for providing specific care. </LI>
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>Fee-for-service - payment for every item of service or unit of care provided. </LI>
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>Target payment (pay for performance, P4P) - payment only made with respect to achievement of an agreed target.</LI>
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>Fund holding- and organisation-level payment systems - which can improve the working conditions within an organisation, and can indirectly influence the salary of a healthcare provider.</LI>
</UL>
<P>We differentiated between healthcare financing interventions for individual smokers and for healthcare providers. In patients, for example, comparisons can be made between full financial coverage and partial financial coverage. For healthcare providers, a maximum target payment can be compared with no target payment. There were no restrictions on the type of smoking cessation treatment for which the financial benefit could be offered. This could include pharmacotherapy (e.g. nicotine replacement therapy, varenicline or bupropion), behavioural support, or a combination thereof. When the financial intervention of a study was aimed at more than one type of smoking cessation treatment, the effect of the financial intervention could be spread out over the different types of products. Studies of financial interventions that are aimed at more than one type of smoking cessation treatment therefore cannot formally be compared with studies that offer coverage for only one product. This is the reason for differentiating between partial and full interventions as discussed in the next paragraph. As a result we focused on full and partial financial interventions. As a smoker could use more than one type of product, summing the use of the different types of smoking cessation treatment could overestimate the number of smokers who used smoking cessation treatment.</P>
<P>We classified the patient-directed financial benefits as full, partial or no intervention, based on theoretical and practical considerations. We considered an intervention that covered the cost of both pharmacotherapy and behavioural support to be a full financial intervention. Full financing need not come from the trial. If there were already existing provisions (e.g. insurance) for partial coverage of smoking cessation treatment (pharmacotherapy or behavioural support) and a trial&#8217;s intervention(s) complemented this benefit by financing either a pharmacotherapy or behavioural support leading to full coverage of smoking cessation treatment, we classified it as a full-coverage intervention. In this case we considered the control group to be partial financial intervention. More specifically, if an intervention provided coverage for either pharmacotherapy or behavioural support, we considered it partial financial coverage. If a study involved gradations of partial financial intervention, we considered the one with more benefits from the trial&#8217;s perspective to be the intervention group while the group receiving lesser benefits was the control group. If, in a given study, a control group received neither trial-based nor already existing financing arrangements for smoking cessation treatment, we considered it a no-financing intervention. On these bases, we employed further stratification depending on the availability of study data.  </P>

<P>We included studies when they used at least one of the following outcome measures to describe the effects of the intervention. The primary outcome measure of this review was:</P>
<UL>
<LI>abstinence from smoking. We included studies reporting abstinence from smoking at least six months after the start of the intervention, and we used the longest available follow-up as the preferred outcome measure (<LINK REF="REF-SRNT-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">SRNT 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hughes-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hughes 2003</LINK>).

</UL>
<P>The secondary outcome measures were:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>number of participants making a quit attempt, defined as the number of participants who attempted to quit at least once. A quit attempt is defined as not having smoked for at least 24 hours.</LI>

<P>We identified eligible studies for the current update by electronic search of the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group Specialised Register, limited to records added since April 2012. This Register includes citations identified via highly sensitive searches for potential reports of controlled trials and other evaluations of interventions for smoking cessation and prevention. At the time of the search on 1 September 2016, the Register included the results of searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled trials (CENTRAL; 2016, issue 7) in the Cochrane Library; MEDLINE (via OVID), to update 20160729, Embase (via OVID), to update week 201639 and PsycINFO (via OVID) to update 20160725. See the <A HREF="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/o/cochrane/clabout/articles/TOBACCO/frame.html">Tobacco Addiction Group Module</A> in the Cochrane Library for full search strategies and list of other resources searched. The search strategy (<LINK REF="APP-01" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 1</LINK>) included MeSH and text terms related to health care costs, health insurance coverage, reimbursement, remuneration, incentives, salaries and fees.</P>
<P>There was no limitation on language. The Cochrane Tobacco Addition Group's Information Specialist performed the register search, and also prescreened retrieved records for relevance to the topic.</P>
<P>In order to retrieve unpublished studies, we contacted experts in the field via a standardised email. We included unpublished studies or abstracts only when sufficient data were available.</P>
<P>For the original review and first update, additional searches of MEDLINE (<LINK REF="APP-02" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 2</LINK>) and Embase were conducted that combined topic-related terms with the same smoking- and design-related terms used in the regular searches for the Register. Since these records are a subset of the records retrieved and screened during regular searches we judged this no longer necessary.</P>

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2017-08-30 10:59:37 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We assessed the risk of bias of the included studies using criteria from Cochrane included in the Review Manager (RevMan) 5 software (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2014</LINK>). The criteria have three levels (low risk of bias, high risk of bias, unclear risk of bias) and the judgement on each item could be complemented using quotes from the study report and the raters&#8217; comments. We rated the following criteria: sequence generation; allocation concealment; blinding of intervention; issues of incomplete data and loss to follow-up; and other unclassified bias identified by the review authors. We summarised findings from these criteria in <LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>.</P>
<P>The reviewers assessing risk of bias were not blinded to the authors, institution or journal title. Two reviewers (FB and GN) independently rated the studies. We held a consensus meeting to discuss and resolve disagreements between the two reviewers. If a study did not contain sufficient information on methodological criteria or the information was unclear, we contacted the study authors for additional information.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Economic Evaluation</HEADING>
<P>We assessed the quality of the economic evaluations using the Consensus Health Economic Criteria (CHEC) list (<LINK REF="REF-Evers-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Evers 2005</LINK>). As its name indicates, the CHEC list was produced based on expert consensus. It consists of 19 items as listed in <LINK REF="APP-04" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 4</LINK> and incorporates the following aspects: clearly described study population (age, gender and educational level), a description of the intervention and the alternatives, a well-defined research question, an economic study design in which the costs and effects of two or more interventions are compared, a time horizon and perspective of the evaluation, the identification of relevant costs and consequences for each alternative, the measurement of costs and consequences, appropriately valued cost and consequences, the performance of an incremental analysis, the performance of discounting and sensitivity analysis, the conclusions following from the data reported, the generalisability of results, statement of conflict of interest and appropriate discussion of ethical and distributional issues. SE independently assessed the quality of the economic evaluations. Items scored as 'yes' received one point. Items scored as 'unclear' or 'no' received no points. We calculated a total score by summing the score of the 19 items (range 0 to 19).</P>

<EFFECT_MEASURES MODIFIED="2017-08-31 16:45:00 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We used only intention-to-treat analyses. If the study did not present an intention-to-treat analysis then we recalculated the published data on an intention-to-treat basis. We counted all dropouts and participants lost to follow-up as continuing smokers or making no quit attempt or not having used smoking cessation treatment. For each study outcome we calculated the risk ratio (RR) and the corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI) as a measure of intervention effect. Since the outcomes (abstinence, quit attempts and use of treatment) were favourable, a ratio greater than unity indicates an outcome favouring financial intervention. Where we calculated pooled effects, we used a Mantel-Haenszel method to estimate the RR using a random-effects model. We considered pooling when at least two trials assessed the effects of healthcare financing interventions and reported data on the same outcome measure. We conducted a formal statistical test for between-studies variance, and assessed whether the observed variability in effect sizes was greater than would be expected to occur by chance (sampling error). We used the I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic, given by the formula ((Q-df)/Q)*100%, to investigate heterogeneity (where Q represents Cochrane&#8217;s Chi<SUP>2</SUP> statistic and df is the degree of freedom, <LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2003</LINK>). We considered a pooled analysis to have moderate and high heterogeneity when the I<SUP>2 </SUP>statistic was more than 50% and 75% respectively.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Economic Evaluation</HEADING>
<P>The transferability of cost estimates of different economic evaluations is mostly restricted by differences in setting. These differences can be related to patient characteristics, incidence of smoking-related diseases, availability of health resources, variations in clinical practice, incentives to healthcare providers and relative prices or costs (<LINK REF="REF-Drummond-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Drummond 2015</LINK>). Pooling of the different economic evaluations is only permissible when there is no interaction between the setting and the effect of the intervention on medical consumption (<LINK REF="REF-Drummond-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Drummond 2015</LINK>). Where pooling was allowed, the volumes of medical consumption, like the use of smoking cessation treatment, were to be pooled and multiplied with the pooled costs per unit consumption. The total costs were calculated in US dollars (USD). When the cost estimates of the different economic evaluations were not transferable, we presented cost data of the individual studies. When no incremental ratios were presented, we calculated the incremental cost effectiveness ratios ourselves. First, we calculated the total costs per group. We then divided the difference in costs between the groups by the difference in number of quitters between the groups. The authors of the studies involved checked the calculation. When currencies other than USD were involved, we used the exchange rates provided by study authors.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Outcomes</HEADING>
<P>Abstinence from smoking after six months or more from the start of the intervention was the primary and preferred outcome. <LINK REF="STD-Boyle-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Boyle 2002</LINK> presented self-reported continuous (more than six months) abstinence rates. The longest follow-up report comes from <LINK REF="STD-Kaper-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Kaper 2006</LINK> in which biochemically validated continuous abstinence was reported at 12 months, while <LINK REF="STD-Selby-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Selby 2014</LINK> reported biochemically validated continuous abstinence for weeks 26-52 and <LINK REF="STD-Twardella-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Twardella 2007</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Papadakis-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Papadakis 2011</LINK> reported biochemically validated continuous abstinence at six months' follow-up.

In <LINK REF="STD-Hughes-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Hughes 1991</LINK>, observers named by the participants were asked to verify reported smoking status of participants. <LINK REF="STD-Dey-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Dey 1999</LINK> assessed abstinence from smoking at 14 weeks after the start of the reimbursement period and <LINK REF="STD-Jardin-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Jardin 2014</LINK> at 12 weeks; therefore, we did not include data from these studies in the analysis of the effects of reimbursement on abstinence rates. <LINK REF="STD-Pakhale-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Pakhale 2015</LINK> had problems with data collection and therefore measured point prevalence abstinence at different endpoints between 26 and 52 weeks, with an average of 33 weeks after baseline.</P>
<P>One of the secondary outcome measures was the number of participants who made a quit attempt. Eight studies presented data on this outcome (<LINK REF="STD-Hughes-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Hughes 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schauffler-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Schauffler 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Boyle-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Boyle 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Halpin-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Halpin 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kaper-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Kaper 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Papadakis-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Papadakis 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jardin-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Jardin 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Selby-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Selby 2014</LINK>).

The cost effectiveness ratio was presented in terms of costs per user who quit smoking or costs per participant enrolled. No study presented data in terms of quality-adjusted life years (QALY) saved. For <LINK REF="STD-Kaper-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Kaper 2006</LINK>, additional information on outcomes on quit attempts, use of treatment and cost were collected from two other related reports (<LINK REF="REF-Kaper-2005a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kaper 2005a</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Kaper-2006a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kaper 2006a</LINK>).</P>

Although the exact method for generating the randomisation sequence was generally not reported, we classified all these 14 studies as having a low risk of bias for this part of the design. Three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Curry-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Curry 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Boyle-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Boyle 2002</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Willemsen-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Willemsen 2013</LINK>) were not randomised trials and did not involve experimental manipulation of conditions. <LINK REF="STD-Willemsen-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Willemsen 2013</LINK> used a natural on-off design in the entire Dutch population and we classified it as having an unclear risk of bias. <LINK REF="STD-Boyle-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Boyle 2002</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Curry-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Curry 1998</LINK> made use of natural experiments in which different insured groups were receiving different smoking cessation benefits.

All studies had interventions directed at smokers and <LINK REF="STD-Twardella-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Twardella 2007</LINK> also included an intervention directed at physicians. As pooling of the different economic evaluations is only allowed when there is no interaction between the setting and the effect of the intervention (<LINK REF="REF-Drummond-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Drummond 2015</LINK>), we did not pool the results of the individual studies.

The calculated financial gain per participant enrolled was USD 1120 with full coverage when gum was provided free, USD 280 when gum was provided at a cost of USD 6 per box and USD 413 when gum cost USD 20. For the incremental analyses, we calculated the costs per additional quitter for the different comparisons. When we compared a full incentive with a partial incentive, the costs per additional quitter were USD 260. When we compared a full incentive with no incentive, the costs were USD 716.

Indirect costs were not registered. With full coverage, the average costs per benefit user who quit were USD 21 for users and USD 1117 for the health plan. With partial coverage, the costs per benefit user who quit were respectively USD 326 and USD 801. We also calculated the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio: if full coverage were introduced instead of partial coverage, the financial gain for users would be USD 5316 for each benefit user who quit.

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2017-09-05 12:28:16 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jonathan Livingstone-Banks">
<P>We identified 14 RCTs, two controlled natural experiments and an ITS study to answer questions on the importance of financial interventions directed at smokers and healthcare providers in increasing abstinence from smoking, quit attempts by smokers, and the use of smoking cessation treatment, and where possible to assess their cost effectiveness. We investigated the effect of financial interventions by identifying comparison subcategories between full, partial, and no financial intervention. Full financial benefits directed at smokers provided very positive outcomes compared to no benefits on continuous abstinence, point prevalence abstinence, and utilisation of smoking cessation treatment. When compared to no benefits, full financial coverage showed a modest but positive effect on quit attempts. Though not consistently, full financial benefits seem to also have more beneficial effect than partial coverage. We detected a mixed effect of the different levels of financial interventions with regard to the different endpoints with low to high levels of between-studies variance (heterogeneity). There is scant evidence to pass judgement on financial interventions directed at healthcare providers, but the available evidence shows only limited impact on smoking cessation.</P>
<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-08-31 16:15:53 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We detected a statistically significant, positive effect of full financial interventions targeting smokers with regard to abstinence from smoking compared to provision of no financial intervention at six months' follow-up or more (all abstinence measures: RR 1.77, 95% CI 1.37 to 2.28, I² = 33%, 9333 participants). The effect of full financial interventions was also extended to favourable outcomes on the use of smoking cessation treatments: the pooled effect of full coverage compared with no financial intervention on the use of smoking cessation treatments was highly significant for each treatment type (NRT, bupropion, and behavioural interventions). Full financial interventions had a small, significant effect on quit attempts (RR 1.11, CI 1.04 to 1.17, I²= 15%, 9065 participants).</P>
<P>When full coverage was compared to partial coverage, results showed no significant additional effect of full coverage on smoking cessation or quit attempts. Pooling together results from four trials, full coverage did increase the use of NRT when compared with partial coverage, though the level of heterogeneity was high (I² = 87%). There were not enough data to investigate the effects of full coverage versus partial coverage on the utilisation of bupropion or behavioural therapy. These findings could mean that full financial interventions may have a significant effect over partial interventions regarding the use of treatment. However, these findings should be interpreted with caution given the high heterogeneity, which reflects the reality that partial interventions could come in various shapes and combinations.</P>
<P>Upon pooling, we found a small positive effect of partial financial interventions compared to no interventions on abstinence (RR 1.27, CI 1.02 to 1.59, I² = 21%, 7108 participants). We did not detect an effect of partial financial interventions compared to other partial or no financial interventions on attempts at quitting. There may be an effect of partial financial interventions when compared to no interventions with regard to the use of pharmacotherapy. Upon the pooling of three studies, the use of bupropion was increased (RR 1.15, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.29, I² = 0%, 6765 participants), The use of NRT was also increased but pooling of the studies just failed to reach statistical significance (RR 1.37, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.91, I² = 91%, 6944 participants). The single study that investigated varenicline (<LINK REF="STD-Selby-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Selby 2014</LINK>) showed a positive effect on its use (RR 1.85, 95% CI 1.68 to 2.03, 1380 participants).</P>
<P>Only three included studies were directed at healthcare providers, which should be considered when interpreting the results. We detected no effect of healthcare provider-directed benefits on continuous abstinence, point prevalence abstinence or on the use of NRT. However, healthcare provider-directed interventions compared to no intervention increased the use of behavioural therapy (RR 1.69, 95% CI 1.01 to 2.86, I² = 85%, 25,820 participants). Financial benefits may induce healthcare providers to provide behavioural-intervention support to smokers, though the high level of heterogeneity suggests results should be interpreted carefully. It should also be borne in mind that financial resource should not be invested merely for increasing smoking cessation treatments unless it can be translated into favourable quitting rates. Generally speaking, our findings seem to support the general trend of mixed and non-conclusive findings on healthcare provider-directed financial interventions for improving patient outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-Steel-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Steel 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Peckham-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Peckham 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Van-Herck-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van Herck 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-De-Bruin-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">De Bruin 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Flodgren-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Flodgren 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ryan-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ryan 2016</LINK>).  </P>
<P>Eight studies (<LINK REF="STD-Hughes-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Hughes 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Curry-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Curry 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schauffler-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Schauffler 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Halpin-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Halpin 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kaper-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Kaper 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Twardella-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Twardella 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-An-2008" TYPE="STUDY">An 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Joyce-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Joyce 2008</LINK>) presented data on cost effectiveness. When full benefit was compared with partial or no benefit, the costs per quitter ranged from USD 97 to USD 7646.</P>
<P>We conclude that full financial interventions directed at smokers when compared to no financial interventions can increase the rate of successful quitting, quit attempts and utilisation of pharmacotherapy in smokers. Although the absolute differences were small, the costs per additional quitter were low. We did not detect a difference in effect between full and partial financial interventions in abstinence from smoking or increased quit attempts, but we did find a significant difference in effect between full and partial interventions in use of NRT and behavioural therapy. Partial versus no financial coverage showed an increase in abstinence and quit attempts and in the use of bupropion and varenicline. There is inadequate evidence to determine the effect of partial financial interventions when compared to other partial financial interventions or no financial interventions on the other outcomes. The conclusions need to be interpreted in light of the reservations discussed below with regard to comparability, classification and methodological quality.</P>

<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2017-09-05 11:25:42 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jonathan Livingstone-Banks">
<P>Despite the creation of relatively homogeneous subcategories for analyses based on theoretical and practical considerations, the studies are still heterogeneous with respect to the study setting, motivation to participate in the study and motivation to quit smoking. Because of such sources of heterogeneity, the results of the meta-analysis have to be interpreted with care. The setting of the included studies ranged from family practices and hospital clinics in the UK, USA and Canada, to health insurance organisations in the USA, Germany and the Netherlands. As each country has a different healthcare system, comparisons between studies in various settings should be made in the knowledge of these differences. In <LINK REF="STD-Dey-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Dey 1999</LINK>, for example, participants had to be motivated to quit in order to participate. On entry into the study, motivated participants received free prescriptions for nicotine patches, and as a result, 97% of the participants in the full incentive group used at least one prescription. Such differences potentially limit the interpretability of the effect size estimates that come out of pooling. On the other hand, <LINK REF="STD-Kaper-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Kaper 2006</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Schauffler-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Schauffler 2001</LINK> offered coverage in a general population. As participants were not enrolled based on motivation to quit smoking, the use of NRT among the intervention groups was 20.6% in <LINK REF="STD-Schauffler-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Schauffler 2001</LINK> and 4% in <LINK REF="STD-Kaper-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Kaper 2006</LINK>. Furthermore, the interventions varied in the extent of financial benefit, the methods of smoking cessation treatment for which the benefit was available, the conditions for receiving the benefit and the information concerning the new benefit. In 12 of the 14 patient-directed financial intervention studies, a financial benefit was available for different types of smoking cessation treatment. In two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Halpin-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Halpin 2006</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Twardella-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Twardella 2007</LINK>), the trial arms did not enable us to examine the independent effect of financial interventions and hence were excluded from the analysis. In <LINK REF="STD-Twardella-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Twardella 2007</LINK>, one of the arms involved both patient-directed and healthcare-directed interventions, while in <LINK REF="STD-Halpin-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Halpin 2006</LINK>, special constraints were put on participants where they were required to attend counselling before free medications were financed.</P>
<P>During subgroup analyses, the main emphasis was on the level of access to smoking cessation treatments: full, partial or no access through financing to enable smokers to quit. Partial interventions could refer to either pharmacotherapy or counselling only. In our subgroup analyses no further stratification was considered for partial interventions for smoking cessation since, in all studies, partial interventions included pharmacotherapy only except <LINK REF="STD-Joyce-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Joyce 2008</LINK>. As a result there is limited confounding by type of treatment provided in the partial intervention group. However, future systematic reviews, with the hope that additional studies would accumulate, need to further stratify partial treatment benefits highlighting the type of smoking cessation treatments covered, at least based on behavioural interventions and pharmacotherapy. This is due to the fact that there could be differences in effect between counselling and pharmacotherapy. It is fair to expect that the kind of pharmacotherapy covered could also influence the outcomes of the financing interventions. All patient-directed studies included in this review covered NRT while nine studies (<LINK REF="STD-Boyle-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Boyle 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Halpin-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Halpin 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kaper-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Kaper 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Twardella-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Twardella 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Joyce-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Joyce 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Papadakis-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Papadakis 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Willemsen-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Willemsen 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Selby-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Selby 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pakhale-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Pakhale 2015</LINK>) also covered bupropion therapy and four studies additionally covered varenicline (<LINK REF="STD-Papadakis-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Papadakis 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Willemsen-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Willemsen 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Selby-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Selby 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pakhale-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Pakhale 2015</LINK>).</P>
<P>An example of different conditions for receiving a financial benefit is related to voluntary or obligatory visits to healthcare providers. In <LINK REF="STD-Kaper-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Kaper 2006</LINK>, participants received coverage after a statement of contact with a healthcare provider was sent to the health insurance company. The use of behavioural support in <LINK REF="STD-Kaper-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Kaper 2006</LINK> is therefore not comparable with <LINK REF="STD-Schauffler-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Schauffler 2001</LINK> or <LINK REF="STD-Joyce-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Joyce 2008</LINK>, in which some or all of the participants voluntarily chose to participate in a behavioural support intervention. There were also differences in the information provided to participants about their benefit and the extension of the benefit. In <LINK REF="STD-Boyle-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Boyle 2002</LINK>, for example, participants were not explicitly informed of the intervention, and as a result only 30% of smokers in the treatment group knew about the offer of financial benefit. This may be the reason for the statistically non-significant effects found in <LINK REF="STD-Boyle-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Boyle 2002</LINK> when compared with other studies, in which participants were informed about their new benefit. Participants&#8217; awareness of the available benefits could contribute significantly to an increase in the effect of the intervention, as it would likely increase the use of smoking cessation treatments and hence increase the absolute number of quitters.</P>
<P>The term 'full intervention' should be interpreted with caution as it is not synonymous with optimal level of care. Furthermore, an intervention classified as partial does not exclude the possibility that some motivated participants may have used additional treatment to complement those financed (e.g. <LINK REF="STD-Schauffler-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Schauffler 2001</LINK>). This phenomenon has also been documented by other investigators (<LINK REF="REF-Hall-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hall 2002</LINK>). As utilisation of smoking cessation treatment was loosely investigated using patient and physician reports or care provider registries, the actual utilisation rates of the services may be lower or higher. It is also difficult to estimate adherence to a prescribed pharmacotherapy from the included studies. As a result, such complexities could have influenced the efficacy of the interventions.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2017-08-31 08:34:31 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>An important limitation of the included studies was that not all used random or concealed allocation. Twelve studies randomly allocated the participants to the treatment or control groups, and only five of these employed concealed allocation. Particularly in <LINK REF="STD-Boyle-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Boyle 2002</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Curry-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Curry 1998</LINK>, there is the possibility of selection bias as the studies were natural experiments. In the remaining studies, the possibility exists that the effect is biased. Furthermore, not all of the studies blinded the participants, healthcare providers or outcome assessors. In studies that assess the effect of a financial intervention, blinding the control group may be important, since control participants who knew that they would not receive a financial benefit for treatment might have felt disadvantaged and changed their behaviour. Such a change would be a threat to the validity of the study. We therefore could not rule out the possibility of biased results in the unblinded studies. However, we also acknowledge that financial interventions may be more difficult to blind than drug interventions.</P>
<P>Another methodological issue in the included studies is the low follow-up rate, which was below 80% in most of the included studies. This may be related to the type of intervention. If, for example, participants are less interested in the financial intervention when they do not want to use smoking cessation treatments or are not motivated to quit, then the number of dropouts could increase. In a conservative analysis, dropouts would be considered to be continuing smokers. However, such analyses were not performed in five studies ( <LINK REF="STD-Dey-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Dey 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schauffler-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Schauffler 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Boyle-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Boyle 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Roski-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Roski 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Twardella-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Twardella 2007</LINK>). For this review, we have rectified the problem by recalculating the results of the studies using an ITT analysis that counted dropouts and participants lost to follow-up as continuing smokers who had not attempted to quit and not used the treatment(s) offered.</P>
<P>Eight studies reported abstinence outcomes based on self-reported smoking status, although guidelines recommend the use of biochemically validated outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-West-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">West 2005</LINK>). Only six studies reported biochemically validated smoking cessation (<LINK REF="STD-Dey-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Dey 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kaper-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Kaper 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Twardella-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Twardella 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Patel-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Patel 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Papadakis-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Papadakis 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Selby-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Selby 2014</LINK>), but <LINK REF="STD-Dey-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Dey 1999</LINK> was not eligible for inclusion into the meta-analysis for the abstinence comparison because follow-up was terminated at 14 weeks. Fortunately, the two studies that assessed the effect of full financing interventions (<LINK REF="STD-Kaper-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Kaper 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Twardella-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Twardella 2007</LINK>) (for which the effect of financial interventions was significant) reported longer-term biochemically validated abstinence rates, and hence, have lower risk of bias in this respect. It is possible that reliance on self-report could have introduced bias in the rest of the studies, as participants who were benefiting from free treatment might be more likely to give socially desirable answers than those in the control group.</P>
<P>From the methodological quality assessment of the economic evaluations, it became clear that only one of the studies reporting on cost effectiveness had performed a full economic evaluation (<LINK REF="STD-Kaper-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Kaper 2006</LINK>). Results were presented in terms of costs per additional quitter or costs per person enrolled. Only one study examined cost effectiveness in terms of quality-adjusted life years (QALY) saved (<LINK REF="STD-Kaper-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Kaper 2006</LINK>).

<P>This is the only review to assess the effects of financial interventions directed at healthcare providers and smokers to encourage the prescription and use of smoking cessation treatments. We found four reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Bains-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bains 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hamilton-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Hamilton 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cahill-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cahill 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cahill-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cahill 2015</LINK>) examining the effects of financial interventions, but they included studies that offered a financial benefit for abstinence rather than coverage of the cost of smoking cessation treatment. <LINK REF="REF-Bains-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bains 1998</LINK> and <LINK REF="REF-Cahill-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cahill 2015</LINK> discussed the use and impact of incentives in population-based smoking cessation programmes. Smokers participated in contests and lotteries or received financial incentives. <LINK REF="REF-Cahill-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cahill 2014</LINK> addressed the effectiveness of workplace interventions for smoking cessation. <LINK REF="STD-Hamilton-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Hamilton 2013</LINK> examined the effect of providing financial incentives to healthcare professionals on the provision and impact of smoking cessation interventions. They did not find sufficient evidence to show an effect of financial incentives for healthcare professionals on a reduction in smoking rates.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2017-08-31 08:37:33 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In this review, covering the full cost to smokers of using smoking cessation treatment increased the number of participants making a quit attempt, the use of smoking cessation treatment, and the number of successful quitters, when compared with no financial coverage. As the majority of the studies were rated at high or unclear risk of bias in three or more domains, and there was variation between the settings, interventions and participants of the included studies, the results should be interpreted cautiously. The differences in self-reported abstinence rate, number of participants making a quit attempt and use of smoking cessation treatments were modest. However, considering the large population of smokers worldwide and the severe health risks of smoking, even modest effects of financial coverage of treatment on smoking cessation could have a substantial effect on public health. The results of this review suggest that full interventions, which cover the cost of pharmacotherapy in combination with behavioural therapy are most promising. This review did not detect an effect of financial interventions directed at healthcare providers on smoking cessation, which suggests that financial interventions may be more beneficial when allocated to smokers directly. However, due to the small number of studies on financial interventions directed at healthcare providers included in this review it may be premature to draw conclusions based on these results.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2017-08-31 08:38:59 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>More randomised controlled trials should be performed that are comparable with the studies that are included in this review so that future analyses can be stratified by setting, intervention and participants. This is also true for interventions directed at healthcare providers as only three randomised trials are available thus far. More emphasis needs to be put on appropriate reporting of the primary endpoint of smoking cessation, particularly biochemical validation and long-term quitting rates (six months or longer). More randomised trials should assess whether financial interventions aimed at healthcare providers can affect the prescribing pattern and uptake of smoking cessation treatments in addition to the smoking behaviour of their participants. Furthermore, full economic evaluations need to be performed to aid academics, policy makers and stakeholders alike. To assess the financial impact of healthcare financing interventions for smoking cessation, it is important to determine the cost effectiveness of these interventions more precisely. A full economic evaluation is needed to enable comparison of cost effectiveness with other preventive healthcare treatments. We also recommend use of a standard definition and classification of healthcare financing interventions, particularly those directed at healthcare providers, as this could facilitate future intervention research, between-studies comparison, and rational allocation of resources.</P>

There were baseline differences; "regarding the stage of change for smoking cessation: in arms TM and TI+TM, the proportion of participants in the pre-contemplation stage - that is, participants with no concrete intention to stop smoking - was lower, and the proportion of participants in both the contemplation and preparation stages was higher than in the usual care and TI arms"</P>

<TH>
<P>Term</P>
</TH>
<TH>
<P>Definition</P>
</TH>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>
<P>Abstinence</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>A period of being quit, i.e. stopping the use of cigarettes or other tobacco products, may be defined in various ways; see also: point prevalence abstinence; prolonged abstinence; continuous/sustained abstinence<BR/>
</P>
</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>
<P>Biochemical verification</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>Also called 'biochemical validation' or 'biochemical confirmation'.<BR/>A procedure for checking a tobacco user's report that he or she has not smoked or used tobacco. It can be measured by testing levels of nicotine or cotinine or other chemicals in blood, urine, or saliva, or by measuring levels of carbon monoxide in exhaled breath or in blood.<BR/>
</P>
</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>
<P>Bupropion</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>A pharmaceutical drug originally developed as an antidepressant, but now also licensed for smoking cessation; trade names Zyban, Wellbutrin (when prescribed as an antidepressant)</P>
</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>
<P>Carbon monoxide (CO)</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>A colourless, odourless highly poisonous gas found in tobacco smoke and in the lungs of people who have recently smoked, or (in smaller amounts) in people who have been exposed to tobacco smoke. May be used for biochemical verification of abstinence.</P>
</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>
<P>Cessation</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>Also called 'quitting'<BR/>The goal of treatment to help people achieve abstinence from smoking or other tobacco use, also used to describe the process of changing the behaviour<BR/>
</P>
</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>
<P>Continuous abstinence</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>Also called 'sustained abstinence'<BR/>A measure of cessation often used in clinical trials involving avoidance of all tobacco use since the quit day until the time the assessment is made. The definition occasionally allows for lapses. This is the most rigorous measure of abstinence<BR/>
</P>
</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>
<P>'Cold turkey'</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>Quitting abruptly, and/or quitting without behavioural or pharmaceutical support</P>
</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>
<P>Craving</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>A very intense urge or desire [to smoke].<BR/>See: Shiffman et al 'Recommendations for the assessment of tobacco craving and withdrawal in smoking cessation trials'<BR/>Nicotine &amp; Tobacco Research 2004: 6(4): 599-614<BR/>
</P>
</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>
<P>Dopamine</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>A neurotransmitter in the brain that regulates mood, attention, pleasure, reward, motivation and movement</P>
</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>
<P>Efficacy</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>Also called 'treatment effect' or 'effect size'<BR/>The difference in outcome between the experimental and control groups<BR/>
</P>
</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>
<P>Harm reduction</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>Strategies to reduce harm caused by continued tobacco/nicotine use, such as reducing the number of cigarettes smoked, or switching to different brands or products, e.g. potentially reduced exposure products (PREPs), smokeless tobacco</P>
</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>
<P>Lapse/slip</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>Terms sometimes used for a return to tobacco use after a period of abstinence. A lapse or slip might be defined as a puff or two on a cigarette. This may proceed to relapse, or abstinence may be regained. Some definitions of continuous, sustained or prolonged abstinence require complete abstinence, but some allow for a limited number or duration of slips. People who lapse are very likely to relapse, but some treatments may have their effect by helping people recover from a lapse.</P>
</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>
<P>nAChR</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>Neural nicotinic acetylcholine receptors<BR/>Areas in the brain that are thought to respond to nicotine, forming the basis of nicotine addiction by stimulating the overflow of dopamine</P>

<P>An alkaloid derived from tobacco, responsible for the psychoactive and addictive effects of smoking.</P>
</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>
<P>Nicotine replacement therapy (NRT)</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>A smoking cessation treatment in which nicotine from tobacco is replaced for a limited period by pharmaceutical nicotine. This reduces the craving and withdrawal experienced during the initial period of abstinence while users are learning to be tobacco-free. The nicotine dose can be taken through the skin, using patches, by inhaling a spray, or by mouth using gum or lozenges.</P>
</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>
<P>Outcome</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>Often used to describe the result being measured in trials that is of relevance to the review. For example smoking cessation is the outcome used in reviews of ways to help smokers quit. The exact outcome in terms of the definition of abstinence and the length of time that has elapsed since the quit attempt was made may vary from trial to trial.</P>
</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>
<P>Pharmacotherapy</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>A treatment using pharmaceutical drugs, e.g. NRT, bupropion</P>
</TD>

<P>Point prevalence abstinence (PPA)</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>A measure of cessation based on behaviour at a particular point in time, or during a relatively brief specified period, e.g. 24 hours, 7 days. It may include a mixture of recent and long-term quitters. See prolonged abstinence, continuous abstinence</P>
</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>
<P>Prolonged abstinence</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>A measure of cessation which typically allows a 'grace period' following the quit date (usually of about two weeks), to allow for slips/lapses during the first few days when the effect of treatment may still be emerging.<BR/>See: <LINK REF="REF-Hughes-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hughes 2003</LINK>
