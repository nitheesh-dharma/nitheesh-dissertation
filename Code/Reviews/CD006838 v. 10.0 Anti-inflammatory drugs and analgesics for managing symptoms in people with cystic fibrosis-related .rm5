<TITLE>The use of drugs to manage symptoms in people with arthritis related to cystic fibrosis</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2016-01-20 13:23:44 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>Arthritis is not a common complication of cystic fibrosis, but it can be a major complication when it does occur. There are two distinct types of arthritis in cystic fibrosis: cystic fibrosis-related arthropathy and hypertrophic pulmonary osteoarthropathy. The best treatment for these conditions is not clear because of the underlying disease and its intense treatment. We planned to report evidence from clinical studies to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of different anti-inflammatory analgesic drugs compared with placebo, with each other or with no treatment. However, we were disappointed that we could not find any completed randomised controlled studies of these treatments or any evidence from non-randomised controlled studies. One study in cystic fibrosis-related arthropathy has finished and may provide some evidence when published. We suggest that there should be a randomised controlled study to look at the effects and the safety of using anti-inflammatory drugs or painkillers or both to manage the symptoms of cystic fibrosis-related arthritis. This is an update of a previously published review (date of last search 19 January 2016). Since no studies have been included in the review up until January 2016, we will still search for studies every two years, but will not publish an updated version of this review until we can include any new studies.</P>

<P>Although it is generally recognised that CFA may be episodic and resolve spontaneously, treatment with analgesics and anti-inflammatory agents may be needed. While this approach may be sufficient to manage symptoms, it is disappointing that no randomised controlled trials to rigorously evaluate these agents were found, nor could the authors identify any quasi-randomised. This systematic review has identified the need for a well-designed adequately-powered randomised controlled trial to assess the efficacy and safety of pharmacological agents for the symptomatic management of cystic fibrosis-related arthritis (CFA and HPO) in adults and children with cystic fibrosis. Studies should also better define the two conditions. A study has recently been conducted in CFA and may help fill this gap when analysed and published.</P>
<P>There are no trials included in the review up to January 2016. We will continue to run searches to identify any potentially relevant studies; however, we do not plan to update other sections of the review until new studies are published.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2016-01-20 13:18:18 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2008-04-22 13:35:30 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>Arthritis in cystic fibrosis (CF) was first described by Ansell and Newman in 1979 when they reported five children with recurrent episodes of joint pain swelling and stiffness (<LINK REF="REF-Newman-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Newman 1979</LINK>). Arthritis remains a relatively infrequent complication of CF but is a cause of significant morbidity when it does occur. Two distinct types of arthritis are described in CF: cystic fibrosis-related arthropathy (CFA) and hypertrophic pulmonary osteoarthropathy (HPO).</P>
<P>CFA is the most common form of joint disease in CF (<LINK REF="REF-Johnson-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnson 1994</LINK>), but relatively few cases have been described. Two studies reported 71 (<LINK REF="REF-Turner-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Turner 1997</LINK>) and 72 (<LINK REF="REF-Botton-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Botton 2003</LINK>) individual cases of CFA in adults and children. The prevalence of CFA is uncertain but it has been estimated as between 2% and 8.5% (<LINK REF="REF-Botton-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Botton 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Johnson-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnson 1994</LINK>). The mean age at onset has been reported as 13.6 years (<LINK REF="REF-Turner-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Turner 1997</LINK>) and 17 years (<LINK REF="REF-Merkel-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Merkel 1999</LINK>); however, Merkel stated that this may have been overestimated if the arthritis had been present but undiagnosed for some years. As people with CF are living longer (<LINK REF="REF-Lewis-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lewis 1999</LINK>), the prevalence of CFA may be increasing (<LINK REF="REF-Merkel-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Merkel 1999</LINK>). There is no formal definition of CFA but it consists of distinct group of symptoms (<LINK REF="REF-Merkel-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Merkel 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Turner-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Turner 1997</LINK>) such as recurrent episodes of joint pain, swelling, tenderness and limitation of movement which may be disabling (<LINK REF="REF-Johnson-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnson 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Merkel-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Merkel 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rush-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rush 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Turner-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Turner 1997</LINK>). Joint pains develop over approximately 12 to 24 hours and episodes last less than one week (<LINK REF="REF-Turner-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Turner 1997</LINK>). Symptoms can disappear completely between attacks (<LINK REF="REF-Turner-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Turner 1997</LINK>). One or more joints may be affected and involvement is often asymmetric. There may also be fever and skin manifestations. Radiographs tend to be normal (<LINK REF="REF-Johnson-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnson 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Turner-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Turner 1997</LINK>); only one study reported abnormalities on X-rays of affected joints (<LINK REF="REF-Rush-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rush 1986</LINK>). In general, there are no differences in lung function, respiratory pathogens, gastrointestinal symptoms or treatment between people with CF with and without arthritis and exacerbations of joint symptoms are generally not associated with exacerbations of pulmonary disease (<LINK REF="REF-Johnson-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnson 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Turner-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Turner 1997</LINK>). CFA may become persistent and disabling (<LINK REF="REF-Johnson-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnson 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Merkel-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Merkel 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Turner-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Turner 1997</LINK>). The pathogenesis and aetiology of CFA are unclear. CFA appears to be clinically distinct from most recognised forms of joint disease and even when it develops into persistent disease, it may not fulfil the criteria for rheumatoid arthritis (<LINK REF="REF-Dixey-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dixey 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Johnson-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnson 1994</LINK>). There could be a genetic predisposition for CFA, but little genotyping has been done and no human leukocyte antigen (HLA) association with CFA has been reported (<LINK REF="REF-Johnson-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnson 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Merkel-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Merkel 1999</LINK>). CFA could be another phenotypic expression of the underlying defect in CF (<LINK REF="REF-Merkel-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Merkel 1999</LINK>). In addition, CFA may be a reactive arthritis (<LINK REF="REF-Johnson-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnson 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Merkel-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Merkel 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rush-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rush 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Turner-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Turner 1997</LINK>). Doyen reported on three people who presented with a <I>Staphylococcus aureus</I> infection before rheumatoid arthritis occurred which was consistent with the American College of Rheumatology criteria (<LINK REF="REF-Doyen-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Doyen 2005</LINK>). CFA has also developed after treatment with fluoroquinolone antibiotics, but results from studies examining this association are equivocal (<LINK REF="REF-Turner-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Turner 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>In people with CF, HPO is less common than CFA with a prevalence of between 2% and 7% (<LINK REF="REF-Botton-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Botton 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Braude-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Braude 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Johnson-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnson 1994</LINK>). HPO is defined as the occurrence of periosteal proliferation of long bones in association with digital clubbing (<LINK REF="REF-Merkel-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Merkel 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Turner-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Turner 1997</LINK>). It usually starts as a dull bone pain or episodic joint pain (<LINK REF="REF-Turner-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Turner 1997</LINK>) and is usually seen in people with CF with more severe lung disease; it worsens during intercurrent pulmonary infection and often presents at this time (<LINK REF="REF-Johnson-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnson 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Merkel-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Merkel 1999</LINK>). People with HPO are more likely to be colonised with <I>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</I> and have a worse prognosis than people without HPO (<LINK REF="REF-Johnson-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnson 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rush-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rush 1986</LINK>). The median age onset in CF is older than for CFA, at around 20 years of age (<LINK REF="REF-Botton-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Botton 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Johnson-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnson 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Turner-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Turner 1997</LINK>). The causes of HPO are unknown (<LINK REF="REF-Turner-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Turner 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>Arthritis in CF can also consist of other conditions such as co-existent rheumatoid arthritis. Doyen reported on three people with CF with rheumatoid arthritis (<LINK REF="REF-Doyen-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Doyen 2005</LINK>). There was a strong association between respiratory status and rheumatoid activity in these people. However, rheumatoid arthritis and the other connective tissue disorders are well known to be independently associated with respiratory complications and this likely represents a distinct complicated group that are not necessarily representative of CF arthropathy in general. In addition exposure to medications may also lead to arthritis and this has been described with quinolones, antibiotics and cimetidine (<LINK REF="REF-Johnson-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnson 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Merkel-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Merkel 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Turner-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Turner 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Warren-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Warren 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>The initial diagnosis depends on the clinical presentation (<LINK REF="REF-Turner-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Turner 1997</LINK>). Turner suggested that if a single joint is involved, a full blood count, measurement of acute phase reactants, radiograph of the affected joint and examination of synovial fluid should be performed (<LINK REF="REF-Turner-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Turner 1997</LINK>). In people with polyarticular involvement, the extent of the disease should be assessed, its functional consequences measured and the joint(s) should be X-rayed. The distinction between CFA and HPO may be made radiographically. Clinicians should also look for an exacerbation of pulmonary infection, skin involvement (vasculitis rash or erythema nodosum) and consider other causes of inflammatory joint diseases along with the development of gout or pseudogout.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2008-04-02 15:26:45 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>Management of arthritis in people with CF is uncertain and complex because of the underlying disease and its intense treatment and to date there has been no formal assessment of the available evidence. Acute attacks of CFA may resolve spontaneously and treatment is limited to alleviation of pain and stiffness, including bed rest and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (<A HREF="johnson%201994">Johnson 1994</A>; <A HREF="turner%201997">Turner 1997</A>). Oral prednisolone or intra-articular corticosteroids such as triamcinolone are sometimes needed. When episodic symptoms progress to persistent disease, disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs such as methotrexate or azathioprine may be tried or gold and hydroxychloroquine (<A HREF="johnson%201994">Johnson 1994</A>). These interventions will be the subject of a further Cochrane Review. In rare cases where arthritis is linked to lung function, antibiotic treatment of the chest may help (<A HREF="johnson%201994">Johnson 1994</A>). However, HPO generally responds to treatment of the chest with intravenous (IV) antibiotics and the resulting improved pulmonary status, rest and NSAIDs help to relieve pain (<A HREF="merkel%201999">Merkel 1999</A>; <A HREF="turner%201997">Turner 1997</A>).</P>

<EFFECT_MEASURES MODIFIED="2012-01-19 13:40:35 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>For continuous outcomes, we plan to record either mean relative change from baseline for each group or mean post-treatment or intervention values and standard deviation. If standard errors are reported, and where possible, these will be converted to standard deviations. We will calculate a pooled estimate of treatment effect by calculating the weighted mean difference.</P>
<P>For binary outcome measures, we aim to calculate a pooled estimate of treatment effect for each outcome across studies using relative risk where appropriate.</P>
<P>Where studies measure data longitudinally, we plan to base our analysis on the final time-point results, which is a common method used in Cochrane Systematic Reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Jones-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jones 2005</LINK>). We accept that this analysis would treat the data as independent, although in reality they are not. However, methods are not yet available to carry out a meta-analysis of aggregate longitudinal data, unless we are able to obtain any individual patient data (IPD).</P>
<P>If we find any count data, we will decide whether to treat this as dichotomous, continuous, time-to-an-event or a rate. Although we accept that it is preferable to decide how count data will be analysed in advance, we think our choice will be determined by the format of the available data and thus can not be decided until most studies have been reviewed.

<P>When conducting a meta-analysis combining results from cross-over studies we plan to use the methods recommended by Elbourne (<LINK REF="REF-Elbourne-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elbourne 2002</LINK>). However, if only limited data are available, we will only be able to either use the first-arm data only or to treat the cross-over studies as if they are parallel studies. Elbourne states that this approach will produce conservative results as it does not take into account within-patient correlation (<LINK REF="REF-Elbourne-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elbourne 2002</LINK>). Also each participant will appear in both the treatment and control group, so the two groups will not be independent.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2008-04-22 12:24:17 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>Cystic fibrosis-related arthropathy (CFA) and hypertrophic pulmonary osteoarthropathy (HPO) are relatively infrequent complications of cystic fibrosis (CF) and few cases have been described in the literature (<LINK REF="REF-Botton-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Botton 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Turner-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Turner 1997</LINK>). It is disappointing that there are no randomised controlled trials to rigorously evaluate the efficacy and safety of pharmacological agents for the management of symptoms of CFA and HPO. The authors investigated whether any other evidence is available for the use of these agents, but found no quasi-randomised nor non-randomised trials; although there have been several case reports published to date (<LINK REF="REF-Benjamin-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Benjamin 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bowler-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bowler 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Braude-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Braude 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Garske-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Garske 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jones-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jones 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lampert-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lampert 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sagransky-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sagransky 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Soden-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Soden 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Summers-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Summers 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vaze-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vaze 1980</LINK>) as well as several case series (<LINK REF="REF-Athreya-1975" TYPE="REFERENCE">Athreya 1975</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bourke-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bourke 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Crawford-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Crawford 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Dixey-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dixey 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lawrence-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lawrence 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Massie-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Massie 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mathieu-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mathieu 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Matthay-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Matthay 1976</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McGuire-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">McGuire 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nathanson-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nathanson 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Newman-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Newman 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pertuiset-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pertuiset 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rush-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rush 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schidlow-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schidlow 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Taccetti-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Taccetti 1995</LINK>). In general, these reports find that CFA is generally episodic and resolves spontaneously but that treatment with analgesics and anti-inflammatory agents may be needed and these are sufficient to manage symptoms. Analgesics and anti-inflammatory agents also help in the management of HPO; but here control of the underlying disease process may be of more help.</P>

<P>No conclusions can be made about the efficacy and safety of pharmacological agents for the symptomatic management of CF-related arthritis in adults and children with CFA and HPO from the information currently available. Clinicians must balance potential benefit against the possible risk of complications in each case.</P>
<P>There are no trials included in the review up to January 2012. We do not plan to update this review until new trials are published, although we will search the Group's Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register on a two-yearly cycle.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2012-01-18 21:40:34 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>This systematic review has identified the need for a multi-centred trial to assess the efficacy and safety of pharmacological agents for the symptomatic management of cystic fibrosis-related arthritis in adults and children. The trial should take into account both subgroups of arthritis (CFA and HPO) and the state of pulmonary and hepatic involvement. A study has been conducted in CFA and may help fill this gap but has not yet been published (<LINK REF="REF-Merkel-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Merkel 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>Early diagnosis of CF-related arthritis is important. Management in early stages where it is self-limiting may be achieved with simple anti-inflammatory and analgesic agents as for arthritis in non-CF patients but management when disease becomes persistent and disabling is of more concern for future research. Given the infrequency of CF-related arthritis and the range of symptoms and severity, RCTs may not be feasible to study such long term management and well-designed non-randomised observational studies may be more appropriate.</P>
<P>Further research is also needed to better characterise CFA and HPO and their outcomes, we suggest:</P>
<OL>
<LI>studies be undertaken to better define CFA and HPO;</LI>
<LI>that researchers should use national databases to determine the extent of the CFA and HPO;</LI>
<LI>that the potential for adverse events, including gastrointestinal effects, associated with the long-term use of NSAIDs needs to be determined; and also how this may impact on the need to use acid suppressive therapy.</LI>
