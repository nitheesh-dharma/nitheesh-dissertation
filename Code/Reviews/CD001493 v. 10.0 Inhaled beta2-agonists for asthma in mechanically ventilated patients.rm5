<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2011-10-11 10:25:15 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>During an asthma attack, the airways narrow, causing breathing problems, wheezing and coughing. A small number of people with asthma need medications given by tubes during mechanically assisted breathing (ventilation). Inhaled bronchodilators help relieve asthma attacks in people who can breathe on their own. However, it is not known if inhaled beta2-agonists (commonly used as bronchodilators), work well for people on ventilation. This review of trials did not find enough evidence to show the effect of inhaled beta2-agonists on people who have mechanically assisted breathing or tubes. More research is needed.<BR/>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2011-10-11 11:00:14 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>A small number of patients with acute severe asthma require intubation and positive pressure ventilation (PPV). The beneficial effects of inhaled bronchodilators on acute asthma in spontaneously breathing subjects are well established, but there remain important questions regarding inhaled beta2-agonists for patients who are intubated and receiving PPV. In such patients, there are questions regarding the effectiveness of medications delivered through an endotracheal tube. The non-physiologic ventilatory pattern imposed by a mechanical ventilator may impair the delivery of medications and the patient-ventilator interface adds a number of variables that may influence the delivery of inhaled medications to the airways. These include the endotracheal tube as a barrier to aerosol penetration (<LINK REF="REF-Ahrens-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ahrens 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Crogan-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Crogan 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Taylor-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Taylor 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Taylor-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Taylor 1991</LINK>), the PPV inspiratory flow pattern and rate (<LINK REF="REF-Fink--1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fink 1996</LINK>), and artificial gas conditioning (<LINK REF="REF-Fuller--1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fuller 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Riordan-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Riordan 1992</LINK>). Most recently, <LINK REF="REF-Rau-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rau 1998</LINK> found differential deposition of aerosols in a mechanically ventilated lung model attributable to different drugs and metered dose inhaler (MDI) actuators and spacers.</P>
<P>There are clinical trials examining the efficacy of inhaled beta2-agonists in intubated patients (<LINK REF="STD-Dhand-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Dhand 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gay-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Gay 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ikeda-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Ikeda 1990</LINK>). However, controversy exists regarding the efficacy and magnitude of effect for specific beta2-agonists, dosages, delivery devices and PPV modes. This review undertook the task of clarifying the effects related to those specifics.</P>
<P>Current state of the literature<BR/>To date there have been no systematic reviews of the literature on this topic. A comprehensive, but non-systematic, narrative review (<LINK REF="REF-Dhand-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dhand 1997</LINK>) concluded that inhaled bronchodilators are effective with PPV. They identified disparity among trials, but did not quantify the effects. Another review by <LINK REF="REF-Lacasse-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lacasse 1996</LINK> addressed comparisons of metered-dose, versus nebulizer delivery for ventilated patients. These authors concluded that RCTs on that topic are warranted.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2011-10-11 11:00:14 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>The aim of this review was to determine the effects of inhaled beta2-agonists on intubated asthmatic patients requiring mechanical ventilation. We specifically sought to quantify the effects of inhaled beta2-agonists on physiologic variables, such as airway resistance and expiratory flow rate, and on patient outcomes, such as duration of intubation.</P>
<P>Although inhaled beta2-agonists are considered standard therapy in this setting, a comprehensive search of the literature failed to locate any published or unpublished RCTs in which inhaled beta2-agonists were compared to placebo in mechanically ventilated asthmatic subjects. A plausible explanation for the lack of trials is that practitioners consider this therapy to be standard practice. Consequently, they may consider it unethical to withhold inhaled beta2-agonists from such patients. Moreover, the rarity and severity of patient presentation may preclude clinical trials in this setting.</P>
<P>On the other hand, studies involving beta2-agonists in severe asthma are possible. For example, comparisons of aerosol versus parenteral routes of administration would not constitute withholding treatment. Results from trials examining parenteral versus inhaled beta2-agonists with non-intubated patients have provided mixed results. A systematic review seeking to clarify the effects of parenteral versus inhaled beta2-agonists in acute asthma failed to find sufficient evidence to recommend the intravenous route over inhaled beta2-agonists (<LINK REF="REF-Travers-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Travers 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>Despite the lack of data generated from this systematic review, there is some evidence to support administration of aerosolised beta2-agonists to intubated patients. Two trials have examined the effects of aerosolised albuterol (salbutamol) on intubated patients, delivered by metered-dose inhalers (MDI). In a randomized cross-over trial, <LINK REF="STD-Gay-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Gay 1991</LINK> compared the effects of MDI versus nebulizer therapy on a mixed population of ventilator-dependent patients. They found significant increases in iso-recoil flow for both MDI and nebulizer groups with no between-group differences.</P>
<P>The other trial, by <LINK REF="REF-Bernasconi-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bernasconi 1990</LINK>, found that nebulised fenoterol decreased resistance to flow, end-expiratory lung volume and intrinsic positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) for intubated patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). <LINK REF="STD-Dhand-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Dhand 1996</LINK> also studied dose responses of MDI therapy with albuterol in intubated patients. Whilst not a randomized trial, in their sample of COPD patients, four puffs of albuterol reduced airway resistance by a magnitude comparable to eight or sixteen puffs.</P>
<P>A review (<LINK REF="REF-Lacasse-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lacasse 1996</LINK>) summarised trials comparing MDI versus nebulised treatment for ventilated patients, and failed to identify any important differences between the delivery methods. Their conclusion is similar to that of a recent Cochrane review which compared nebulizer versus MDI delivery for non-hospitalized asthmatic patients (<LINK REF="REF-Cates-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cates 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>The data from the aforementioned studies suggest that aerosolised beta2-agonists reduce airway resistance and increase expiratory airflow in some intubated patients. Yet findings from another non-randomized trial (<LINK REF="REF-Nassari-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nassari 1981</LINK>) question the need for delivering aerosols down endotracheal tubes at all. In a group of COPD patients, the effects of fenoterol nebulised to deposit above the endotracheal tube cuff or delivered by MDI through the endotracheal tube lumen was compared. Both groups experienced decreases in airway resistance which were of comparable magnitudes.</P>
<P>Despite the evidence that intubation and mechanical ventilation hamper aerosol deposition (<LINK REF="REF-Ahrens-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ahrens 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Crogan-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Crogan 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Taylor-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Taylor 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Taylor-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Taylor 1991</LINK>), we found no RCTs that compared aerosolised versus parenteral routes of administration, specific agents, or delivery devices for these patients.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2011-10-11 10:25:15 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There are no data from well designed RCTs to provide evidence for or against the current practice regarding use of inhaled beta2-agonists in intubated patients.</P>
<P>In view of the lack of evidence from RCTs, should this practice be stopped? The answer to this question is 'no,' because ancillary evidence suggests that beta2-agonist treatment in intubated patients may be beneficial. Until large RCTs are conducted, the practice should not be abandoned.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2011-10-11 10:25:15 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
