<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2014-03-12 15:03:38 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Kurinchi Selvan Gurusamy">
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>The liver produces bile, which has many functions, including elimination of waste processed by the liver and digestion of fat. Bile is temporarily stored in the gallbladder (an organ situated underneath the liver) before it reaches the small bowel. Concretions in the gallbladder are called gallstones. Gallstones are present in about 5% to 25% of the adult Western population. Between 2% and 4% become symptomatic within a year. Symptoms include pain related to the gallbladder (biliary colic), inflammation of the gallbladder (cholecystitis), obstruction to the flow of bile from the liver and gallbladder into the small bowel resulting in jaundice (yellowish discolouration of the body usually most prominently noticed in the white of the eye, which turns yellow), bile infection (cholangitis), and inflammation of the pancreas, an organ that secretes digestive juices and harbours the insulin-secreting cells that maintain blood sugar level (pancreatitis). Removal of the gallbladder (cholecystectomy) is currently considered the best treatment option for patients with symptomatic gallstones. This is generally performed by key-hole surgery (laparoscopic cholecystectomy). Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is generally performed by inflating the tummy with carbon dioxide gas to permit the organs and structures within the tummy to be viewed so that the surgery can be performed. The gas pressure used to inflate the tummy is usually 12 mm Hg to 16 mm Hg (standard pressure). However, this causes alterations in the blood circulation and may be detrimental. To overcome this, lower pressure has been suggested as an alternative to standard pressure. However, using lower pressure may limit the surgeon's view of the organs and structures within the tummy, possibly resulting in inadvertent damage to the organs or structures. The review authors set out to determine whether it is preferable to perform laparoscopic cholecystectomy using low pressure or standard pressure. A systematic search of medical literature was performed to identify studies that provided information on the above question. The review authors obtained information from randomised trials only because such types of trials provide the best information if conducted well. Two review authors independently identified the trials and collected the information.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>A total of 1092 patients were studied in 21 trials. Patients were assigned to a low pressure group (509 patients) or a standard pressure group (583 patients). The choice of treatment was determined by a method similar to the toss of a coin. Most of the trials included low surgical risk patients undergoing planned laparoscopic cholecystectomy.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>Laparoscopic cholecystectomy could be completed successfully using low pressure in approximately 90% of people undergoing this procedure. No deaths were reported in either low pressure or standard pressure groups in eight trials that reported deaths (total of 434 patients in both groups). Seven trials with 394 patients described complications related to surgery. One participant experienced the outcome of serious adverse events (low pressure group 1/179, 0.6%; standard pressure group 0/215, 0%). Quality of life, return to normal activity, and return to work were not reported in any of the trials. The difference in the percentage of people undergoing conversion to open operation (from key-hole operation) between the low pressure group (2/269; 0.8%) and the standard pressure group (2/287; 0.7%) was imprecise. This was reported in 10 studies. No difference was noted in the length of hospital stay between the groups. Operating time was about two minutes longer (very low quality evidence) in the low pressure group than in the standard pressure group. Currently no evidence is available to support the use of low pressure pneumoperitoneum in low surgical risk patients undergoing planned laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The safety of low pressure pneumoperitoneum has to be established.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of evidence</B>
</P>
<P>Only one trial including 140 participants was at low risk of bias (low chance of arriving at wrong conclusions because of study design). The remaining 20 trials were at high risk of bias (high chance of arriving at wrong conclusions because of trial design). The overall quality of evidence was very low.</P>
<P>
<B>Future research</B>
</P>
<P>Further well-designed trials are necessary, particularly in high surgical risk patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy.<BR/>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-03-12 15:03:20 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Kurinchi Selvan Gurusamy">
<P>A total of 1092 participants randomly assigned to the low pressure group (509 participants) and the standard pressure group (583 participants) in 21 trials provided information for this review on one or more outcomes. Three additional trials comparing low pressure pneumoperitoneum with standard pressure pneumoperitoneum (including 179 participants) provided no information for this review. Most of the trials included low anaesthetic risk participants undergoing elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy. One trial including 140 participants was at low risk of bias. The remaining 20 trials were at high risk of bias. The overall quality of evidence was low or very low. No mortality was reported in either the low pressure group (0/199; 0%) or the standard pressure group (0/235; 0%) in eight trials that reported mortality. One participant experienced the outcome of serious adverse events (low pressure group 1/179, 0.6%; standard pressure group 0/215, 0%; seven trials; 394 participants; RR 3.00; 95% CI 0.14 to 65.90; very low quality evidence). Quality of life, return to normal activity, and return to work were not reported in any of the trials. The difference between groups in the conversion to open cholecystectomy was imprecise (low pressure group 2/269, adjusted proportion 0.8%; standard pressure group 2/287, 0.7%; 10 trials; 556 participants; RR 1.18; 95% CI 0.29 to 4.72; very low quality evidence) and was compatible with an increase, a decrease, or no difference in the proportion of conversion to open cholecystectomy due to low pressure pneumoperitoneum. No difference in the length of hospital stay was reported between the groups (five trials; 415 participants; MD -0.30 days; 95% CI -0.63 to 0.02; low quality evidence). Operating time was about two minutes longer in the low pressure group than in the standard pressure group (19 trials; 990 participants; MD 1.51 minutes; 95% CI 0.07 to 2.94; very low quality evidence).<BR/>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2014-03-12 15:03:40 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Kurinchi Selvan Gurusamy">
<P>About 5% to 25% of the adult Western population have gallstones (<LINK REF="REF-GREPCO-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">GREPCO 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-GREPCO-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">GREPCO 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bates-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bates 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Halldestam-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Halldestam 2004</LINK>). The annual incidence of gallstones is about one in 200 people (<LINK REF="REF-NIH-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">NIH 1992</LINK>). Only 2% to 4% of people with gallstones become symptomatic with biliary colic (pain), acute cholecystitis (inflammation), obstructive jaundice, or gallstone pancreatitis within a year (<LINK REF="REF-Attili-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Attili 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Halldestam-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Halldestam 2004</LINK>). Cholecystectomy (removal of the gallbladder) is the preferred option in the treatment of symptomatic gallstones (<LINK REF="REF-Strasberg-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Strasberg 1993</LINK>). Every year, more than 0.5 million cholecystectomies are performed in the US and 60,000 in the UK (<LINK REF="REF-Dolan-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dolan 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-HES-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">HES 2011</LINK>). Approximately 80% of cholecystectomies are performed laparoscopically (by key-hole surgery) (<LINK REF="REF-Ballal-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ballal 2009</LINK>). Biliary colic (pain in the right upper abdomen lasting longer than half an hour) is one of the symptoms related to gallstones (<LINK REF="REF-Berger-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Berger 2000</LINK>) and is the most common indication for cholecystectomy (<LINK REF="REF-Glasgow-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glasgow 2000</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2014-03-12 15:03:47 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Kurinchi Selvan Gurusamy">
<P>Traditionally, one of the first steps in laparoscopic cholecystectomy is the creation of pneumoperitoneum (<LINK REF="REF-Russell-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Russell 1993</LINK>) using carbon dioxide (CO<SUB>2</SUB>) through a Veress needle (<LINK REF="REF-Casati-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Casati 1997</LINK>) or through a port (hole) (<LINK REF="REF-Alijani-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alijani 2004</LINK>) in the abdominal wall. Traditionally, the pressure used is around 15 mm Hg (<LINK REF="REF-Russell-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Russell 1993</LINK>). The created pneumoperitoneum allows visualisation and manipulation of instruments inside the abdominal cavity. Increased intra-abdominal pressure due to the pneumoperitoneum causes several cardiopulmonary changes. The increased intra-abdominal pressure increases the absorption of CO<SUB>2</SUB>, causing hypercapnia and acidosis, which must be avoided by hyperventilation (<LINK REF="REF-Henny-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Henny 2005</LINK>). It also pushes the diaphragm upwards, decreasing pulmonary compliance (<LINK REF="REF-Alijani-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alijani 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Henny-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Henny 2005</LINK>), and increases the peak airway pressure (<LINK REF="REF-Galizia-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Galizia 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Alijani-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alijani 2004</LINK>). Increased intra-abdominal pressure increases the venous return due to blood compressed out of the splanchnic vasculature (<LINK REF="REF-Henny-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Henny 2005</LINK>). Pneumoperitoneum also increases systemic vascular resistance (<LINK REF="REF-Galizia-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Galizia 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mertens-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mertens 2004</LINK>) and pulmonary vascular resistance (<LINK REF="REF-Galizia-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Galizia 2001</LINK>). Carbon dioxide pneumoperitoneum predisposes to cardiac arrhythmias (<LINK REF="REF-Egawa-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Egawa 2006</LINK>). During the early phase of pneumoperitoneum, cardiac output is reduced (<LINK REF="REF-Galizia-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Galizia 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Alijani-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alijani 2004</LINK>) by decreasing venous return (<LINK REF="REF-Neudecker-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Neudecker 2002</LINK>). Although these cardiorespiratory changes may be tolerated by healthy adults with adequate cardiopulmonary reserve, people with cardiopulmonary diseases may not tolerate these cardiopulmonary changes. About 17% of patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy have an American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) status of III or IV (<LINK REF="REF-Giger-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Giger 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-ASA-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">ASA 2007</LINK>). Abdominal wall lift, using a special device (eg, Laparolift (<LINK REF="REF-Egawa-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Egawa 2006</LINK>), Laparo-tensor (<LINK REF="REF-Alijani-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alijani 2004</LINK>)) introduced through a port in the abdominal wall, has been used to decrease the cardiopulmonary changes and has been considered in a different review (<LINK REF="REF-Gurusamy-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gurusamy 2012</LINK>). Helium insufflation is an alternative to CO<SUB>2</SUB> insufflation (<LINK REF="REF-Neuhaus-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Neuhaus 2001</LINK>) and has been reported to have little or no effect on pulmonary function in pigs (<LINK REF="REF-Junghans-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Junghans 1997</LINK>). However, concerns about the solubility of helium in the blood and hence the risk of gas embolism have precluded its routine use in humans (<LINK REF="REF-Neuhaus-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Neuhaus 2001</LINK>).</P>

</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2014-03-12 15:03:52 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Kurinchi Selvan Gurusamy">
<P>In our previous version of the review, we found evidence from trials with high risk of bias showing that low pressure pneumoperitoneum decreased pain scores (<LINK REF="REF-Gurusamy-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gurusamy 2009</LINK>). However, pain scores are unvalidated surrogate outcomes for pain in people undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy, and several Cochrane systematic reviews have demonstrated that pain scores can be decreased with no clinical implications in people undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy (<LINK REF="REF-Gurusamy-2014a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gurusamy 2014a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gurusamy-2014b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gurusamy 2014b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gurusamy-2014c" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gurusamy 2014c</LINK>). In addition, no study has evaluated the level of pain scores that people undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy or any other elective or emergency operation consider as important. The minimal clinically important difference in pain scores has also not been established in people undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy or any other elective or emergency operation.

<P>We included all randomised clinical trials that compared different pressures of pneumoperitoneum in participants undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy (irrespective of language, blinding, publication status, or sample size, or whether the trials were adequately powered). We did not consider randomised trials that compared abdominal wall lift in combination with pneumoperitoneum versus pneumoperitoneum alone. Such trials were included in the review in which abdominal lift and pneumoperitoneum were compared (<LINK REF="REF-Gurusamy-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gurusamy 2012</LINK>).</P>

<P>For binary outcomes, we calculated the risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI). We also planned to report the risk difference if the conclusions would have changed by using risk difference, because risk difference allows meta-analysis including trials with zero events in both groups. For continuous variables, we calculated the mean difference (MD) with 95% CI for hospital stay as well as standardised mean difference (SMD) with 95% CI for variables such as quality of life.</P>

<P>We performed an intention-to-treat analysis (<LINK REF="REF-Newell-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Newell 1992</LINK>) when possible for binary outcomes. For continuous outcomes, we used available-case analysis in the presence of missing data unless the study authors reported an intention-to-treat analysis based on an appropriate method of imputation of data such as multiple imputation. We planned to use intention-to-treat analysis if such analysis was available. We imputed the standard deviation from P values according to instructions given in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Intervention</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>) and used the median for the meta-analysis when the mean was not available. If it was not possible to calculate the standard deviation from the P value or the CIs, we imputed the standard deviation as the highest standard deviation in the other trials included under that outcome, fully recognising that this form of imputation would decrease the weight of the trial for calculation of mean differences and would bias the effect estimate to no effect in the case of standardised mean differences (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Trial sequential analysis</HEADING>
<P>We planned to use trial sequential analysis to control for random errors due to sparse data and repetitive testing of accumulating data (<LINK REF="REF-CTU-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">CTU 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Thorlund-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thorlund 2011</LINK>). The underlying assumption of trial sequential analysis is that testing for significance may be performed each time a new trial is added to the meta-analysis, resulting in an increased risk of random errors. We planned to add the trials according to the year of publication, and if more than one trial was published in a year, we planned to add the trials alphabetically according to the last name of the first author. We planned to construct trial sequential monitoring boundaries on the basis of the required information size. These boundaries determine the statistical inference one may draw regarding the cumulative meta-analysis that has not reached the required information size; if the trial sequential monitoring boundary is crossed before the required information size is reached, firm evidence may perhaps be established and further trials may turn out to be superfluous. On the other hand, if the boundary is not surpassed, it may be necessary to continue doing trials to detect or reject a certain intervention effect (<LINK REF="REF-Brok-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brok 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wetterslev-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wetterslev 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Brok-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brok 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Thorlund-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thorlund 2009</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Wetterslev-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wetterslev 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Thorlund-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thorlund 2010</LINK>).   </P>
<P>We planned to apply trial sequential analysis (<LINK REF="REF-CTU-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">CTU 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Thorlund-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thorlund 2011</LINK>) using a diversity-adjusted required information size (DARIS) calculated from an alpha error of 0.05, a beta error of 0.20, a control event proportion obtained from the results, and a relative risk reduction of 20% for binary outcomes with two or more trials to determine whether more trials on this topic are necessary. Trial sequential analysis cannot be performed for standardised mean difference. So, we did not plan to perform a trial sequential analysis for quality of life. For hospital stay, return to normal activity, and return to work, we planned to calculate the DARIS from an alpha error of 0.05, a beta error of 0.20, the variance estimated from the meta-analysis results of low risk of bias trials (if available), and a minimal clinically relevant difference of one day. For operating time, we planned to calculate the DARIS using a minimal clinically relevant difference of 15 minutes, with remaining parameters the same as for hospital stay.</P>

No mortality was reported in either the low pressure group (0/199; 0%) or the standard pressure group (0/235; 0%). As no mortality was reported in either group, we were unable to use the control group proportion for calculation of the required information size of the trial sequential analysis. Instead, we used a proportion of 0.2% in the control group based on data from approximately 30,000 patients included in a database in Switzerland (<LINK REF="REF-Giger-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Giger 2011</LINK>). The proportion of information accrued was only 0.12% of the DARIS, and so the trial sequential monitoring boundaries were not drawn (<LINK REF="FIG-04" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 4</LINK>).

No significant difference was noted in the proportions of participants with serious adverse events between the low pressure group (1/179; 0.6%) and the standard pressure group (0/215; 0%) (RR 3.00, 95% CI 0.14 to 65.90) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>). As only serious adverse events were reported in only one trial, the issue of fixed-effect model versus random-effects model does not arise. As no serious adverse events were reported in the control group, we used the overall proportions in both groups as the control group proportion for performing trial sequential analysis. The proportion of information accrued was only 0.14% of the DARIS, and so the trial sequential monitoring boundaries were not drawn (<LINK REF="FIG-05" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 5</LINK>). The cumulative Z-curve does not cross the conventional statistical boundaries.</P>

No significant difference in the conversion to open cholecystectomy was observed between the low pressure group (2/269; 0.7%) and the standard pressure group (2/287; 0.7%) (RR 1.18, 95% CI 0.29 to 4.72) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>). The trial sequential analysis revealed that the proportion of information accrued was only 0.55% of the DARIS, and so the trial sequential monitoring boundaries were not drawn (<LINK REF="FIG-06" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 6</LINK>).

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Hospital stay</HEADING>
<P>None of the trials reported the proportion discharged as day-procedure laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Length of hospital stay was reported in five trials (<LINK REF="STD-Unbehaum-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Unbehaum 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wallace-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Wallace 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Barczynski-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Barczynski 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Joshipura-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Joshipura 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sandhu-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Sandhu 2009</LINK>). Hospital stay was statistically shorter in the low pressure group than in the standard pressure group by the fixed-effect model (MD -0.27 days, 95% CI -0.36 to -0.17) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>). This difference was not clinically significant. No significant difference was noted between the groups using the random-effects model (MD -0.30 days, 95% CI -0.63 to 0.02). No imputation of mean or standard deviation was performed, and so the sensitivity analysis was not performed. The trial sequential analysis suggested that it is unlikely that future trials will demonstrate any significant difference in length of hospital stay between low pressure groups and standard pressure groups as the cumulative Z-curve has crossed the DARIS but does not cross the conventional statistical boundaries (<LINK REF="FIG-07" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 7</LINK>).</P>

Excluding these trials from the analysis did not alter the results. The trial sequential analysis revealed that the DARIS has been crossed. The conventional statistical boundaries were crossed by a cumulative Z-curve favouring standard pressure pneumoperitoneum.

<P>This review compared the safety and effectiveness of low pressure pneumoperitoneum versus standard pressure pneumoperitoneum. No mortality was noted in either group in the eight trials that reported mortality (<LINK REF="STD-Wallace-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Wallace 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dexter-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Dexter 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Perrakis-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Perrakis 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hasukic-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Hasukic 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chok-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Chok 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Karagulle-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Karagulle 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sandhu-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Sandhu 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Celik-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Celik 2010</LINK>). Serious adverse events were reported in seven trials only (<LINK REF="STD-Wallace-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Wallace 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dexter-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Dexter 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hasukic-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Hasukic 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chok-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Chok 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Karagulle-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Karagulle 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sandhu-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Sandhu 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Celik-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Celik 2010</LINK>). No statistically significant difference was seen in the proportion of participants with serious adverse events between the low pressure group (1/179; 0.6%) and the standard pressure group (0/215; 0%). Conversion to open cholecystectomy was reported in 10 trials (<LINK REF="STD-Dexter-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Dexter 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Barczynski-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Barczynski 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Perrakis-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Perrakis 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sefr-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Sefr 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chok-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Chok 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ibraheim-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Ibraheim 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Karagulle-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Karagulle 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Joshipura-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Joshipura 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sandhu-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Sandhu 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Celik-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Celik 2010</LINK>). In many of these trials, the reason for conversion and the outcomes of participants who underwent conversion to open cholecystectomy were not reported (<LINK REF="STD-Barczynski-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Barczynski 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Perrakis-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Perrakis 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sefr-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Sefr 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ibraheim-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Ibraheim 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Joshipura-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Joshipura 2009</LINK>). A small proportion of participants who underwent conversion to open cholecystectomy (and for whom the reason for conversion or the outcome was not available) may have been converted to open cholecystectomy because of procedure-related injuries such as injuries to the viscera or bile duct. This possibility has not been ruled out in this review. In addition, the confidence intervals of serious adverse events are wide, and significant increases or decreases in complications due to low pressure pneumoperitoneum cannot be ruled out. Hence, no conclusion can be made about the safety of low pressure pneumoperitoneum.</P>
<P>The potential benefit of using low pressure pneumoperitoneum is reduced cardiopulmonary complications. However, even in trials that reported morbidity, no cardiopulmonary complications were described. This is likely to be due to inclusion of only low anaesthetic risk participants in the trials, as well as the low overall incidence of cardiopulmonary complications (0.5% in a case series of 400 patients, 70% of whom were low anaesthetic risk patients) (<LINK REF="REF-Dexter-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dexter 1997</LINK>). Information on whether low pressure could be beneficial in patients with cardiopulmonary disease is not available from the trials included in this review and requires investigation in further trials.</P>
<P>Operating time was two minutes longer in the low pressure group, and this finding is not clinically significant. Hospital stay was not different between the two groups using the random-effects model. Although the fixed-effect model showed significantly shorter hospital stay in the low pressure group than in the standard pressure group, this difference is not clinically significant.</P>
<P>Thus no clinical benefit of low pressure pneumoperitoneum is apparent, and information about its safety is lacking.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="2">Differences between first and second versions</HEADING>
<P>The methods of the review have been revised according to version 5.1.0 of the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>)<I>. </I>This resulted in a change in outcomes and in risk of bias. Outcomes related to pain scores were excluded from the revised version, as the clinical implication of reduction in pain is not clear. A clinically significant reduction in pain score is likely to result in shorter hospital stay, earlier return to normal activity, and earlier return to work, all of which have been included in the revised version.</P>

<B>Trial sequential analysis of mortality</B>
<BR/>The diversity-adjusted required information size (DARIS) was calculated to 352,564 participants, based on the proportion of participants in the control group with the outcome of 0.2%, for a relative risk reduction of 20%, an alpha of 5%, a beta of 20%, and a diversity of 0%. After accrual of 434 participants in the eight trials, only 0.12% of the DARIS has been reached. To account for zero event groups, a continuity correction of 0.01 was used in the calculation of the cumulative Z-curve (blue line). Accordingly, the trial sequential analysis does not show the required information size and the trial sequential monitoring boundaries. As shown, not even the conventional boundaries (dotted red line) were crossed by the cumulative Z-curve.</P>

<B>Trial sequential analysis of serious adverse events </B>
<BR/>The diversity-adjusted required information size (DARIS) was calculated to 281,924 participants, based on the proportion of participants in the control group with the outcome of 0.25%, for a relative risk reduction of 20%, an alpha of 5%, a beta of 20% and a diversity of 0%. To account for zero event groups, a continuity correction of 0.01 was used in the calculation of the cumulative Z-curve (blue line). After accrual of 394 participants in the seven trials, only 0.14% of the DARIS has been reached. Accordingly, the trial sequential analysis does not show the required information size and the trial sequential monitoring boundaries. As shown, not even the conventional boundaries (dotted red line) were crossed by the cumulative Z-curve.</P>

<B>Trial sequential analysis of conversion to open cholecystectomy </B>
<BR/>The diversity-adjusted required information size (DARIS) was calculated to 100,279 participants, based on the proportion of participants in the control group with the outcome of 0.70%, for a relative risk reduction of 20%, an alpha of 5%, a beta of 20%, and a diversity of 0%. To account for zero event groups, a continuity correction of 0.01 was used in the calculation of the cumulative Z-curve (blue line). After accrual of 556 participants in the 10 trials, only 0.55% of the DARIS has been reached. Accordingly, the trial sequential analysis does not show the required information size and the trial sequential monitoring boundaries. As shown, not even the conventional boundaries (dotted red line) were crossed by the cumulative Z-curve.</P>

<B>Trial sequential analysis of hospital stay</B>
<BR/>The diversity-adjusted required information size (DARIS) was 183 participants based on a minimal relevant difference (MIRD) of one day, a variance (VAR) of 0.47, an alpha (a) of 5%, a beta (b) of 20%, and a diversity (D<SUP>2</SUP>) of 91.83%. Neither the conventional statistical boundaries (dotted red line) nor the trial sequential monitoring boundaries (red line) are crossed by the cumulative Z-curve (blue line), although the DARIS has been reached. The findings are consistent with no significant difference in length of hospital stay between low pressure and standard pressure pneumoperitoneum with low risk of random errors.</P>

<B>Trial sequential analysis of operating time</B>
<BR/>The diversity-adjusted required information size (DARIS) was 37 participants based on a minimal relevant difference (MIRD) of 15 minutes, a variance (VAR) of 258.34, an alpha (a) of 5%, a beta (b) of 20%, and a diversity (D<SUP>2</SUP>) of 0%. The conventional statistical boundaries (dotted red line) are crossed by the cumulative Z-curve (blue line) after the fourth trial. The trial sequential monitoring boundary (red line) is crossed by the cumulative Z-curve after the second trial. The findings are consistent with low pressure pneumoperitoneum associated with a longer operating time than standard pressure pneumoperitoneum with low risk of random errors.</P>
