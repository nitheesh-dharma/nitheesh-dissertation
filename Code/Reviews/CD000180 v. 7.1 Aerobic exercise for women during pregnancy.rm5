<P>Regular aerobic exercise during pregnancy appears to improve physical fitness, but the evidence is insufficient to infer important risks or benefits for the mother or baby.</P>
<P>Aerobic exercise is physical activity that stimulates a person's breathing and blood circulation. The review of 14 trials, involving 1014 pregnant women, found that pregnant women who engage in vigorous exercise at least two to three times per week improve (or maintain) their physical fitness, and there is some evidence that these women have pregnancies of the same duration as those who maintain their usual activities. There is too little evidence from trials to show whether there are other effects on the woman and her baby. The trials reviewed included non-contact exercise such as swimming, static cycling and general floor exercise programs. Most of the trials were small and of insufficient methodologic quality, and larger, better trials are needed before confident recommendations can be made about the benefits and risks of aerobic exercise in pregnancy.</P>

<P>We included 14 trials involving 1014 women. The trials were small and not of high methodologic quality. Of the nine trials reporting on physical fitness, six reported significant improvement in physical fitness in the exercise group, although inconsistencies in summary statistics and measures used to assess fitness prevented quantitative pooling of results. Eleven trials reported on pregnancy outcomes. A pooled increased risk of preterm birth (risk ratio 1.82, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.35 to 9.57) with exercise, albeit statistically non-significant, does not cohere with the absence of effect on mean gestational age (mean difference +0.10, 95% CI -0.11 to +0.30 weeks), while the results bearing on growth of the fetus are inconsistent. One small trial reported that physically fit women who increased the duration of exercise bouts in early pregnancy and then reduced that duration in later pregnancy gave birth to larger infants with larger placentas.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2009-12-22 14:09:40 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Physically demanding work during pregnancy has been associated with an increased risk of preterm birth (<LINK REF="REF-Henriksen-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Henriksen 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mamelle-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mamelle 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mozurkewich-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mozurkewich 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Saurel-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Saurel 2004</LINK>), prolonged labour (<LINK REF="REF-Magann-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Magann 2002</LINK>), and reduced fetal growth (<LINK REF="REF-Perkins-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Perkins 2007</LINK>) in some observational studies. Moreover, numerous reports (<LINK REF="REF-Brenner-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brenner 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Clapp-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clapp 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hatoum-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hatoum 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pijpers-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pijpers 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Veille-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Veille 1985</LINK>) have documented fetal physiological responses (especially increase in the fetal heart rate) to single, brief bouts of maternal exercise. The impact of prolonged and repeated aerobic exercise on outcomes of clinical importance for mothers and infants is unknown, however. Two published meta-analyses (<LINK REF="REF-Leet-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leet 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lokey-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lokey 1991</LINK>) and a narrative review (<LINK REF="REF-Dye-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dye 2003</LINK>) have attempted to summarize the evidence but included observational studies as well as randomized trials. The 2000 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, a national population health survey in the United States, the most common leisure-time physical activities during pregnancy included walking, swimming, and aerobics (<LINK REF="REF-Evenson-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Evenson 2004</LINK>). Given the important health benefits of regular physical activity (e.g., reduced blood pressure, improved well-being) for non-pregnant women (<LINK REF="REF-Manson-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Manson 1999</LINK>), many pregnant women may wish to continue exercising during pregnancy. Evidence-based recommendations for exercise during pregnancy are therefore important.</P>

<P>Overall, the trials are quite small, and none are of high methodologic quality. In most of the trials, the method of treatment allocation was either by alternation or was not described. Most did not specify the number of women originally allocated and the numbers of, and reasons for, losses to follow up. Very few provided data on compliance with the prescribed exercise program, and three excluded non-compliers from the analysis. Those studies excluding non-compliers also excluded women developing obstetric contraindications (e.g., bleeding, intrauterine growth restriction, preterm birth). These exclusions did not appear to have substantially biased the overall results, however. Nor did we identify other sources of bias in any of the included studies that could impact results apart from those already mentioned.</P>

Inconsistency in the measures used to measure physical fitness across studies (e.g., aerobic capacity, cardiopulmonary measures, or physical work capacity) and the absence of 'change' data made it difficult to statistically combine the results on physical fitness.</P>
<P>Results on pregnancy outcomes in the above trials are limited to <LINK REF="STD-Bell-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Bell 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Clapp-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Clapp 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Clapp-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Clapp 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Collings-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Collings 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Erkkola-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Erkkola 1976</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lee-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Lee 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Marquez-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Marquez 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Memari-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Memari 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Prevedel-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Prevedel 2003</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Santos-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Santos 2005</LINK>. As shown by the wide confidence intervals, the small size of these trials permits exclusion of only extremely large effects for most of the reported outcomes. Increasing exercise in sedentary women had no significant effect on mean birthweight (mean difference (MD) +49.49, 95% confidence interval (CI) -27.74 to +126.73 g). The data are somewhat reassuring (albeit based only on two small trials) that increasing exercise in sedentary women does not result in a clinically important shortening of gestation (MD +0.10, 95% CI -0.11 to +0.30 weeks). Despite that result, increasing exercise was associated with a non-significant increase in the risk of preterm birth (risk ratio (RR) 1.82, 95% CI 0.35 to 9.57). No significant effects were observed on mean five-minute Apgar score (MD 0.15, 95% CI -0.10 to 0.39) or on risk of cesarean delivery (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.60 to 1.53). Data on stillbirth, neonatal death, pre-eclampsia, and cesarean section are limited to one or two trials each, with small sample sizes and hence inconclusive results.</P>
<P>Other than outcomes related to maternal physical fitness, consistency of results across these trials is evaluable for preterm birth, cesarean delivery, gestational (maternal) weight gain, gestational age, birthweight, and five-minute Apgar score, each of which was reported by at least three trials. Within these limits and those imposed by small sample sizes, the results appear reasonably consistent except perhaps for five-minute Apgar score. Because of the small sample sizes and other methodologic limitations of the reported trials, however, heterogeneity is difficult to assess. Despite not contributing quantitative data for pooling, the results by <LINK REF="STD-Wolfe-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Wolfe 1999</LINK> are in line with those already described.</P>
<P>The single trial (<LINK REF="STD-Bell-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Bell 2000</LINK>) investigating the effects of reducing high-frequency (at least five times per week) to lower-frequency (no more than three times per week) aerobic exercise is too small to make confident inferences about the benefits or risks of such a reduction.</P>
<P>One small trial (<LINK REF="STD-Clapp-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Clapp 2002</LINK>) reported that physically fit women who increased the duration of their exercise bouts in early pregnancy, then reduced the duration in later pregnancy ('Hi-Lo' pattern), gave birth to much larger infants (difference in mean birthweight 460.00, 95% CI 251.63 to 668.37 g) with larger placentas than control women who maintained a moderate exercise duration throughout gestation. Women with the opposite pattern ('Lo-Hi') had similar outcomes to those in the control group.</P>
<P>One small trial (<LINK REF="STD-Santos-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Santos 2005</LINK>) in overweight women (body mass index 25 to 30 kg/m2) found no significant difference in risk of preterm birth (RR 1.89, 95% CI 0.18 to 19.95) or mean birthweight (MD -5.00, 95% CI -241.27 to +231.27 g) associated with the intervention.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2009-11-14 20:18:53 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Future trials will require much larger sample sizes to detect potential effects on maternal and infant health. The suggestion that regular exercise may increase the risk of preterm birth (despite its inconsistency with the absence of effect on mean gestational age) requires further study, especially in light of the results of some observational studies of heavy work or prolonged standing (<LINK REF="REF-Henriksen-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Henriksen 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mamelle-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mamelle 1984</LINK>). The report of large increases in birthweight and placental size in physically fit women who prolonged their bouts of exercise in early pregnancy followed by reduction in later pregnancy requires confirmation in larger trials. Besides the traditional focus on fetal growth and gestational duration, future trials should assess the potential impacts on pain and duration of labour and on the risk of cesarean section, as well as possible reduction in risks of pregnancy-induced hypertension and pre-eclampsia (<LINK REF="REF-Weissgerber-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weissgerber 2004</LINK>). Given the differential risks and benefits of weight-bearing versus nonweight-bearing aerobic exercise for women in general and during pregnancy (<LINK REF="REF-Artal-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Artal 1989</LINK>), future trials should also compare types of aerobic exercise.</P>

<P>The Abstract for this review is misleading. It comments that 11 studies are included, and then states that five reported increased physical fitness. No data are presented and it is unclear why the authors conclude that aerobic exercise increases physical fitness.</P>
</FEEDBACK_SUMMARY>
<FEEDBACK_REPLY MODIFIED="2009-11-26 21:35:52 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In the Abstract, we clearly indicate that the measures of physical fitness were highly heterogeneous, and thus data presentation would require separate tables for all measures in all studies reporting on fitness.</P>

<P>Both review authors independently evaluated trials under consideration for methodological quality and appropriateness for inclusion without consideration of their results. Any disagreement was resolved through discussion.</P>
<P>We assessed the validity of each study using criteria outlined in the Cochrane Reviewers' Handbook (<LINK REF="REF-Alderson-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alderson 2004</LINK>). We operationalized selection bias using quality scores for allocation concealment: adequate (A), unclear (B), or inadequate (C). We assessed attrition bias in terms of percentage loss of participants (dropouts, withdrawals) and whether the losses were asymmetric, that is, different in the randomized groups. Attempts were made to contact study authors to provide missing data.</P>
<P>Both review authors independently extracted study data. RevMan5 was used for data entry and meta-analysis; reported effect measures are relative risks and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for dichotomous outcomes and weighted mean differences and their 95% CIs for continuous outcomes. We report outcomes within data type (dichotomous versus continuous), with dichotomous outcomes presented first. Results are reported for three different comparisons, based on the types of participants and specific nature of the trial interventions: (1) increase in exercise among sedentary pregnant women; (2) initial increase followed by reduction in exercise among fit pregnant women; and (3) initial reduction followed by increase in exercise among fit pregnant women.</P>
<P>All analyses were based on the principle of intention to treat, whether or not the original studies presented their results as such.</P>
