March 10. ****sections need attention***&lt;br&gt;Synopsis: Is there a combined Salmeterol and IPB. I did not know about it. The pasting seems to have gone astray in the middle of the synopsis. It needs revision.&lt;br&gt;Abstract: LABA costs more than IpB so this does not read well at present. Conclusions clash with clinical practice as Salmeterol is not standard Rx. I think the single treatment comparison needs to be reported in terms of the possible advantages of swapping LABA for salmeterol or adding the latter (not the IpB). The clinical questions are which drug do you start with, and then do you add the other or swap!&lt;br&gt;Backgroung: I do not think preventing exacerbations is a primary effect of bronchodilators. It exacerbation is defined to include increased use of rescue medication it may appear that this is a benefit, but this is not how readers will understand this and I would remove this? &lt;br&gt;Description of studies: Wadbo seems to have lost its link to the reference. Isn't it fascinating to see how the goalposts differ in terms of excluding reversibility in the the studies! Well spotted.&lt;br&gt;Methodological quality. Van Molken is in the list of 4 studies with power calculation but it not an included studies.&lt;br&gt;Results: CRQ in the single comparison should not include the report of which individual arm reached clinical significance (cut this and stick to the between group results in the rest of the paragraph please). Interesting that lung function benefits of Salmeterol do not translate into any other benefits for Salmeterol over IpB! Please check P value for final Formoterol result as it was scrambled.&lt;br&gt;Discussion: Fine&lt;br&gt;I have run spellcheck&lt;br&gt;Toby you have done an excellent job on this review and it will be ready for submission when the final points above are sorted. Can you let me know when it is ready on Archie?&lt;br&gt;Chris.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;***************************888888888888888888888888888888888***********************&amp;#163;$%&lt;br&gt;SA response: 01022006&lt;br&gt;I am excedingly happy with both versions. Thank god we have split the reviews- what a monstrosity it was. The only comment i have refers to the IpBr vs SABA review: the 5th paragraph form the end of the discussion starting &amp;quot;The present analysis shows that ipratropium and combination therapy was comparable to SABA therapy&amp;quot; can go west as this is covered in your earlier additions &amp;quot;...that ipratropium as monotherapy resulted in less adverse events and need for oral steroids........&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;======================================&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Review split by TJL (27012006)&lt;br&gt;Sarah has agreed that splitting the review is a sensible option. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;----------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br&gt;25/1/06 CJC edit following Peer review responses.&lt;br&gt;I am afraid that both Peer reviewers found the review to be very long and quite difficult to read. I suspect that this is because the review has grown from the protocol (IPB v SABA) to now include LABA as well. Since these are both compared v each other and as IpB add on the review actually addresses 4 separate questions. I think for the sake of the readers these need to be separated out much more clearly. I have gone back to the protocol which clearly addressed IpB v SABA and in addition to SABA. &lt;br&gt;As this review will need a good deal of editing from the present version I think that the best way forward might be to simplify this review by restricting it to SABA and generating a new review for IpB v LABA or in addtion to LABA. Toby is ready with the new trial data to update the LABA question (which really cannot be answered from the small number of studies in the current review).&lt;br&gt;Toby could you contact Sarah to see if she would be happy for us to rework this topic on the basis of separate reviews for SABA and LABA. I think we could aim for the SABA review and LABA protocol for this submission and the LABA review for the next submission?&lt;br&gt;Cheers,&lt;br&gt;Chris.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;*********************************************************************************&lt;br&gt;20/12/05&lt;br&gt;CJC edit&lt;br&gt;Apart from a couple of typos that I have changed this looks good and can go forward. It will be very interesting to see how the data from the two unpublished studies compare and contrast to the published data - but this can go in the next update or we may miss the deadline. Toby can you send this for peer review please?&lt;br&gt;Chris.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++&lt;br&gt;22/11/2005&lt;br&gt;1. Thanks for sending the raw data - I assume the figures in brackets are standard errors and multiplying these by SQRT(N) = 13.5 for first arm I get slightly different SD for Rennard1996:627D so could you just let me know how you did the calculations in relation to change from baseline FEV1 as I make the SD 0.18 not 0.14? HAve I made a mistake?&lt;br&gt;2. The combivent cough symptoms have a very tight SD but this may reflect the way the outcome was measured. Does not matter too much but I would take more not of the quality of life scores which may be better validated.&lt;br&gt;Chris.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;===============================================================&lt;br&gt;2/11/2005&lt;br&gt;Thanks for tidying this up Toby. I would still be grateful if the the authors could recheck the SDs as outlined in my comment on Oct 6th. This does not seem to come from the paper in the case of Rennard so must be from manufacturers and I would like the see the derivation of the SD entered into RevMan as it is so low! I am happy with the new discussion section and when the above has been checked this can out for peer review.&lt;br&gt;Chris.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;==========================================================&lt;br&gt;131005&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear Sarah and Phillippa,&lt;br&gt; A few additional musings in the attached file.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Essentially this is the detail of the changes I have made:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1) Funnel plot of FEV1 - this is added as a graphic in the review. See the symbol under figures 'Additional figures'. I have edited this image in photoshop for clarity (RevMan is incredibly unhelpful and does not always convey the exact meaning of what is labelled).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2) Sensitivity analysis - I have removed Friedman from the outcomes where there is some disharmony, and reported the different effect sizes in an additional table (Table 01).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3) Discussion - I have also alluded to the possible difference in effect sizes between Friedman and the other studies by explaining the differences in terms of adverse events related to metaproteronol. Who knows for sure what is going on here? It is possible that the consistently positive effect in the Friedman study reflects poor uptake of metaproteronol (see comment on adverse events), or that the difference is not necessarily indicative of a different true effect for that trial, and in fact could simply be an artefact of the reduction in requirement of oral steroids which although consistent across the studies may have given a more exagerated effect on health status measurement in this study (see reference to Spencer 2004 (i.e. Mrs Steve Milan) in the review).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All new text in the review is in red. I have kept a back-up of the review in case you thick wot I have written is duff. Chris did mention his concerns about the discrepancy between the Friedman study and the others to me, and I think that (hopefully!) the additional text strikes a balance between having to go through the studies with a fine toothcomb and giving a sensible treatment of the statistically heterogeneous outcomes in the review. Let me know what you reckon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cheers,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Toby &lt;br&gt;=========================================&lt;br&gt;CJC editing 6 October 2005&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Authors' Contribution - fine, but I have taken my name off the list as I did not contribute in a major way to this review.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Objectives: simplified in abstract and methods. Thanks for making clear the changes from protocol (very sensible move). I have shortened this in the interventions paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Table of included studies: ***Could you review the allocation concealment for Friedman. The paper reports that the patients were randomized by order of admission. I would regard this as inadequate and you may need to change the Allocation concealment and Jadad scores accordingly!**** This will also need to be changed in the methodological quality of studies. Where does 'computer generated' come from? Correspondence with BI? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Metaview Labels: ***Toby could you go through and switch off totals for single study outcomes please****&lt;br&gt;Comparison 1 - Looks as if there is an error in SD for Combivent 94 symptom scores cough as this is much smaller than the other studies. Please check and amend this if appropriate. Similarly Rennard in Fatigue for CRQ has very low SD.&lt;br&gt;Comparison 2 - Title is via nebuliser but some of these studies are MDI ? change title please?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Synopsis: fine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abstract: fine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: I have removed the mention of direction of effect on the graphs as we no longer need to point this out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Fine but Friedman seems to stick out as different in several outcomes. ? There was a big differential dropout in this study which is only mentioned in passing in methodological quality but could have altered the results. I think this needs discussion in results or mention in the discussion section.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Discussion: See re Friedman above.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Contentious issues: What is different about the Friedman 1996 study? It seems to stand apart from the other results?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spellchecked: done&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next action: Back to Toby to turn off totals and ask authors to attend to a couple of issues as above.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;==============================================&lt;br&gt;PP 2nd October&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well done the Poms, and well done Sarah- what a marathon. This is still valuable esp for guiding choice of therapy in early COPD when PRN dosing required. In more severe COPD agree that Tiotropium will over as patients require regular therapy for symptoms and / or to reduce exacerbations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Review now includes another study. Taskkin (1986)-only reported lung function, and adverse events. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have gone through an tidied a few typos, and amended some sentences for clarity, but not changing any meaning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Havw changed the reference to Barr to update it to 2005 review&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think it is ready to go to Chris. and have sent it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;---------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br&gt;Exported from Review Manager 4.2&lt;br&gt;SA 13/09/05 marking the decline of Australian test cricket supremacy, finally. &lt;br&gt;In re: &lt;br&gt;1. &lt;br&gt;in comparison 03 03, change from baseline FVC, the 0.18 is the value extracted from the graph for the salmeterol group only as AJRCCM accepted a paper that presented the data from only one of two treatment arms! (?dodgey). The equivalent data from the Mahler study is missing becasue they commented that FVC outcomes were similar to those for FEV1. In re 0301: Change from baseline FEV1, the Mahler ipratropium data looks like it is missing but the change = 0.0ml (extracted from the graph).&lt;br&gt;I'm not sure where the rogue data came from in 0307, it has been deleted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. On close inspection of the guideline criteria, I am not too bothered by the new NICE criteria. They are essentially the same as the 1997 BTS- which also says obstruction is partially reversible = not fully reversible (NICE). For this review reversibility isn't an issue, wasn't an exclusion criteria and the studies did not specify that COPD was classified according to any criteria in particular, but rather subjects had to have a ratio &amp;lt; 70%, an FEV1 &amp;lt;65% predicted, 10 pack year smoking history and no history of asthma or eosinophilia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PP 09/05&lt;br&gt;Notes in PP ACBA0405 (attached)&lt;br&gt;1. Please look at analyses 0303 and 0307. There is one isolated mean value&lt;br&gt;in each of these (0.18 and 3.0 respectively). Are these suposed to be there?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. you say that COPD has to be defined by BTS British Thoracic Society. See&lt;br&gt;below that there has been quite a shift from &amp;quot;fixed' in 1997 to &amp;quot;not fully&lt;br&gt;revesible&amp;quot; in 2004. Have you enforced the 1997 defintion strictly or have&lt;br&gt;you allowed trials over time with more reversibility? if so, should probably&lt;br&gt;amend the definiton of COPD for inlcusion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Old BTS definition 1997&lt;br&gt;Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a chronic, slowly&lt;br&gt;progressive disorder characterised by airflow obstruction re&lt;br&gt;duced FEV1 and FEV1/VC ratio) that does not change markedly over several&lt;br&gt;months. Most of the lung function impairment is fixed, although&lt;br&gt;some reversibility can be produced by bronchodilator (or other) therapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Usually a cigarette smoking history of more than 20 pack-years is obtained,&lt;br&gt;although COPD does occur rarely in non-smokers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Recent BTS NICE guidelines 2004&lt;br&gt;COPD is characterised by airflow obstruction, which is&lt;br&gt;usually progressive, not fully reversible and does not change&lt;br&gt;markedly over several months. The disease is predominantly&lt;br&gt;caused by smoking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SA comments to Phillippa 03/05&lt;br&gt;I asked Toby about the equivalence limits issue and he has suggested that we say we are comparing the relative efficacy and safety of AC and BA. I made changes accordingly, but he said that Chris will no doubt have a go at the objectives anyway.&lt;br&gt;What I haven't done is replace all references to IpB with shorter acting AC. I'm not sure if this is what you meant anyway.&lt;br&gt;I have dealt with the statistical heterogeneity issue and have put the n's in for the Gross and Campbell studies as suggested. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exported from Review Manager 4.2.3&lt;br&gt;PJP notes 14 March 2005&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bit of a rush sorry! Is looking pretty good&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have made red text changes in the text and left notes in the text where more clarification required &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some random things:&lt;br&gt;1. Toby is Graham Barr's tio review now on the library ? If so change the Barr reference to 2005 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Need to consider the wording of the objective to determine if AC &amp;quot;is as effective as&amp;quot; BA. Toby does this imply that are looking to see if equivalent to, in which case should use equivalence limits and don't want to do that! Perhaps &amp;quot;compare the effects of AC and BA&amp;quot; , . Remember you are also comparing adverse effects!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. suggest switch off totals in comparisons 0316, 0403&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;4. suggest Call Ipra a shorter acting AC ( as opoosed to tiotropium which is a long acting AC) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;5. suggest consistency/readability in format for reporting results- I started to do!!!!&lt;br&gt;suggest (Peto OR = 0.42, 95% CI:0.18, 0.96).&lt;br&gt;(WMD = 0.42, 95% CI:0.18, 0.96). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;6. The discussion is very long and a little repetitive with the results, nonetheless it reads OKl. I have made soem minor changes but not major surgery- will take a bit of time if you do decide to cut it !&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;7. Haven't had time to check refs&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;please get back if comments above or in the text are not clear&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Phillippa&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Exported from Review Manager 4.2&lt;br&gt;SA comments 24/01/04&lt;br&gt;Last search August 2004. &lt;br&gt;Number of trials clarified - In results: The review contains results from 15 trials presented in 16 published papers. Two papers presented different outcome measures generated by the same trial (van Noord 2000; R. -van Molken 1999). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-In re &amp;quot;These trials are listed as having n=1 in Metaview&amp;quot; : I have inserted sample sizes and means where possible. SOme of the outcomes for Mahler say results for FVC were similar to those for FEV1 and therefore I cant include means where none were given, but the n is shown at least. &lt;br&gt;-I think I have subscripted all of the FEV1s now. Sorry about that.&lt;br&gt;-The numbering is sorted out and comparison 05 is now 03.&lt;br&gt;-In re reduced CS use in those recieving IpB alone or in combination- I have made some small additions in red but I'm not able to make clinical statements re this and would appreciate your help as to whether you could reccommend Rx based on this in absence of subjective/objective improvements.&lt;br&gt;-All drugs are in lower case in analyses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exported from Review Manager 4.2.3&lt;br&gt;PP notes 4/10/04&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wow!pretty darn good! You have done so much good work. Very little that I can see to change this time thru'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have tried to highlight in red text areas I changed (apart from minor typos, the odd hyphen).-&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Comments/questions to address:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When did you conduct do the last search?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Please clarify number of trials included in the systematic review (as well as number of paper reports). 15 and 16 are mentioned. It might help to indicate more clearly which are the reports of the same study&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Think we leave out any ref to tiotropium and the reasons why. I have already moved your rationale up earlier. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;These trials are listed in Metaview as having n of 1 and in this case these studies are not included in the meta-analysis&amp;quot;. &lt;br&gt;PP Why don't you put the proper n's in? It tells the readers the size of the trials that have not been able to be included in the metaaanalysis.They still won't go into the metaanalysis if there is no mean or measure of spread. If there were means and no SDs good to put them in the anaysis table -then we could see, and you might discuss whether the means are consistent with other results you find by metanalysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drug names are out of synopsis. May make this even simpler.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FEV1 should really have 1 as a subscript ( as you have done variably), but I couldn't get &amp;quot;find and replace&amp;quot; to work! Over to you&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Take off the (!) next to Brian's name in coauthors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Numbering- I renumbered for clarity in the results section. Currently the Analysis comparisons don't line up with this-minor change only required-05 should be 03 I think (Ipb vs LABA).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fact that subjects on IpB or IpB/SABA were less likely to go onto systemic steroids is a very important finding , given the terrible adverse effect of long term use of oral steroids. It also might mean less exacerbations which is important. More needs to be made of this point in abstract/discussion/clinical implications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analyses: the headings (pharmaceutical names)-you variably use title and lower case- suggest use all lower case (e.g ipratropium rather than Ipratropium)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's about all for now! Look forward to your responses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regards&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Phillippa&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Exported from Review Manager 4.2&lt;br&gt;Comments SLA 16/2/04&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Title changed from &amp;quot;anti-cholinergic therapy versus ........&amp;quot; to &amp;quot;Ipratropium bromide versus.......&amp;quot; because there is currently a review of tiotropium bromide underway. THis decision was made after correspondence with Toby Lasserson&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Comments by PJP 28th October 2001&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well done Sarah. I have been through again and made very minor changes to test -typos, grammar, clarity. Took drug names out of synopsis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Appreciate Chris and Paul's comments on how to best handle the BI lack of data issue. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks to all involved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Comments by Sarah Appleton, 25 October 2001.&lt;br&gt;Thanks for your changes. The Synopsis and implications read really well now.&lt;br&gt;1. Have corrected Meta-view titles- treatment and axis labels where necessary.&lt;br&gt;2. Have added a tile of anti-cholinergic + LABA vsLABA, then sub title IpB + LABA....etc, where required.&lt;br&gt;we state in the Description of Studies that Ipratropium was the only anti-chol medication used in these studies.&lt;br&gt;3. Deseslected totals in comparison 04 04. yes looks much better.&lt;br&gt;4. RE the Oxitropium study- I have only seen an abstract, and although it says RCT, double blind etc I am loathe to put in the included studies without seeing the full text. Besides, the abstract lists 95 people- which are distributed across 3 treatment groups and therefore not enough info to include even &amp;quot;N=....&amp;quot;.&lt;br&gt;5. Re drug costs- I feel that what we have said is enough probably as costs will certainly vary across continents. If you want to put in costs per puff then please go ahead, but I don't think it is worth spending a lot of time chasing the data.&lt;br&gt;6. Detailing my correspondence would take a long time- searching through old emails etc. This is partly troublesome as I didn't realise that Microsoft Outlook was dropping off messages older than 9 months old so I have lost some. I know I should have had hard copies but I didn't make any. Frankly, I would rather wait until we get hassled about this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;re comments 5 Sept 2001&lt;br&gt;Where n= 1 in Colice, it means that I wasn't able to input the data- eg they measured but didn't report. I put a comment in the review explaining this a while ago.&lt;br&gt;Have added hypertext links in the Description of studies explaining drug doses.&lt;br&gt;Re Results- &amp;quot;Day 85 Peak change from baseline- please explain.&amp;quot; - I can't find this in the text- SORRY! It means peak change of that parameter on day 85 from day 85 baseline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Comments PJP 12 October 2001&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have gone through again and made minor changes for clarity. This is a great amount of work, very well done. We are nearly there ? another publication by Christmas?.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have a read through and see what you think- I have altered mainly the discussion and the implications&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The synopsis and abstract have been tidied up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Main tasks for you: &lt;br&gt;(i) to go through metaview and label the treatments and axes in a consistent way- some are ipra vs beta-2 ag, some e.g. 0105 0106 etc are treatment vs control. As the readers may be looking at the group means and not WMDs ( as there are so few) it would help to have that done to guide the reader. So on each metaview the axes are labelled and the treatments are labelled with the drugs. Scroll through them all- some need both doing, some axes, some treatments, some neither e.g.0101.&lt;br&gt;(ii) ensure consistency in spelling of beta-2 agonist in the metaview - I think I got all the text changes&lt;br&gt;(iii) ipra and beta-2 agonist do not have capitals as generic names or classes ( except where is is abbreviated to IpB).&lt;br&gt;(iv) do you think the titles in description and results should be anticholinergic, rather than ipratropium?&lt;br&gt;do you have any data on the oxitroptium study in 2)- should it go in the comparison tables (as a study) to remind us of its existence&lt;br&gt;(iv) comparison 0404 shouldn't have a total selected - makes it look better than it is&lt;br&gt;(v) are you able to check the cost of combivent in Australia say 2 puffs qid vs ipra 0.2 2 puffs qid vs salb 2 puffs qid- I will check NZ data when I get back and try to inlcude to strengthen the point about cost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do you want to detail exactly how many times you contacted BI and when (and clarify if it was BI Australia) as they may deny they were contacted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Comments PJP 5 Sept 2001&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sarah have made lots of little grammar style syntax changes - hope that's OK&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Can you check reviewer details for contract reviewer- it has had Sonia Cendon's name on? why&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;the abstract search strategy and main search strategy are different - can you make these the same&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;scrolling through metaview- many of the studies appear to have only one patient ( e.g. COLICE) in some of the comparisons but in others it is OK - perhaps check data tables&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some bits that could be more clearly expressed-&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Description of studies: when you detail the doses used it is a bit unclear which doses of b2 agonist relate to whcih study. perhaps put the hypertext link next to the dose.&lt;br&gt;Results: day 85 peak change from baseline - can this be defined &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Comments PJP 14 July 2001&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. WOW! enormous review lots of work. FAntastic effort I'm not sure that we do need to split into 2 however, although one could argue that we are lumping together IB vs BA and IB (+ BA) vs placebo (+BA) and if the two are to be together maybe it makes more sense to put the IB +BA vs BA with the IB vs placebo review! The third alternative is to make a sep review of IB +BA vs BA. This may happen in the future, but for now leave together. It is hard to keep a track of sometime- all efforts need to be directed towwards making it as readable and useful as possible-esp discussion . Has Brian or anyone else had a look and thought about splitting it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. I need to go through and make some stylistic/ grammar changes e.g in the synopsis/ abstract /discussion which I haven't yet done. e.g don't really think the statement &amp;quot;inconsistent&amp;quot; is helpful-the effect was either significant or not. If not-either not enough studies, no effect, not clinically relevant, studies reaching significantly opposite conclusions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Things I would suggest in the body of the review need a little more work include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;a.description of studies- needs hypertext links inn paras 1 and 2 for clarity&lt;br&gt;b. any details on % smokers, range of severity within the trial ( not just mean FEV1), ?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;c. Main check- Analyses ( Metaview) : Can you check all outcomes that all the data possible is entered-e.g. there is no data in Outcomes 0104 0105, 0106, 0110, ) 0201 has some n's of 1 etc.&lt;br&gt;Is comparison O5 all forms ( i.e. inhaled and nebulised) IB? add this for clarity&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Numbering of outcomes seems a little confusing some are the same as earlier and some not. ? renumber 1,2,3,4,5, etc for all outcomes e.g 0901 and 0902 rather 0909 and 0912 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Include in the review somewhere paper I think from this reference ( do you have and can you check? If not I can insert soemwhere later) - that half patients preferred IB and half BA. Were there any other papers which reported the patient preference?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;a randomised db crossover study comparing the effects of ipratropium 2 puffs qid and salbutamol 2 puffs qid for 7 days in 15 patients with COPD, there was no difference in exercise tolerance or breathlessness scores at the end of the treatment interval Blosser SA, Maxwell SL, Reeves-Hoche MK, Localio AR, Zwillich CW. Is an anticholinergic agent superior to a beta 2-agonist in improving dyspnea and exercise limitation in COPD? Chest 1995;108:730-5.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Need to discuss the place of giving patients a therapeutic trial of one and then the other and allow them to choose which one is best&lt;br&gt;Agree little evidence for combination on benefit. Trials haven't really looked at step therapy as they may yet show that the addition of a second agent may be better than increasing the dose of one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Add details of cost of IB vs BA, also cost of LABA in Aust or NZ. I would have thought that a decrease in steroid use is worth having. Need to include pharmacoeffectiveness. health care ultisation measures , exacerbation frequency. in future studies&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;? define tachyphylaxis &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. I wonder whether we need to think about and make a statement about equivalence limits (the differnece statistically exceeding the MCID)- with the lack of useable data not really an issue right now but if BI suddenly come in with data was are going to have to know how we say they are equivalent or different.

<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>This review looks at studies that compare the regular use for at least four weeks of different types of bronchodilator medicine (long acting beta-2 agonist medicines and ipratropium) in people with stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD, or emphysema/chronic bronchitis). <BR/> <BR/>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a condition associated with high morbidity, mortality and cost to the community. Patients often report symptomatic improvement with long acting beta-2 agonists (LABAs) and anticholinergic bronchodilator medications (ipratropium). These medications have different mechanisms of action and therefore theoretically could have an additive effect when combined. As these medications are prescribed in COPD as long term therapy, it is important to know what benefit there are, if any, of prescribing ipratropium alone or as combination therapy over LABAs. Seven studies (2652 participants) were included. Salmeterol was more effective than ipratropium on lung function, but there were no major differences seen between the responses to ipratropium and salmeterol on symptoms. When we compared the combination of these two drugs with salmeterol, combination was superior to salmeterol in terms of quality of life, but the differences between these two treatments on other measurements were small and inconsistent. The findings of the review would not support a general recommendation for the use of ipratropium bromide over a beta-2 agonist alone in COPD, but the combination does confer greater benefit in health status. At this stage, people with COPD should use the bronchodilator that gives them the most improvement in their symptoms. Combination therapy should be considered, but the relative effects of this therapy in relation to other forms of inhaled therapy such as inhaled steroids and tiotropium are unknown. Cost considerations also need to be taken into account as there are considerable variations in price of bronchodilators. </P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a condition associated with high morbidity, mortality and cost to the community. Patients often report symptomatic improvement with long acting beta-2 agonists (LABAs) and anticholinergic bronchodilator medications, both of which are recommended in COPD guidelines. These medications have different mechanisms of action and therefore theoretically could have an additive effect when combined.

</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To compare the relative efficacy and safety of regular long term use (at least four weeks) of ipratropium bromide and LABA in patients with stable COPD. Comparisons were made between single agents and in combination versus LABAs alone. </P>

<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>All randomised controlled trials comparing treatment for at least four weeks with an anticholinergic agent (ipratropium bromide) alone or in combination with LABA versus LABA alone, delivered via metered dose inhaler or nebuliser, in non-asthmatic adult subjects with stable COPD. </P>

<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Seven studies met the inclusion criteria of the review (2652 participants). <U>Monotherapy comparison (six studies)</U>: There was a significantly greater change in favour of salmeterol in morning PEF and FEV1. There were no significant differences in quality of life, exacerbations, or symptoms. Formoterol appeared to confer some benefits over ipratropium treatment in terms of morning peak flow. <U>Combination comparison (three studies)</U>: There was a significant improvement in post-bronchodilator lung function, supplemental short-acting beta-agonist use and HRQL in favour of combination therapy compared with salmeterol alone. </P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2008-07-03 16:13:11 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>The available data from the trials suggest that there is little difference between regular long term use of IpB alone and salmeterol if the aim is to improve COPD symptoms and exercise tolerance. However, salmeterol was more effective in improving lung function variables. In terms of post-bronchodilator lung function, combination therapy conferred modest benefits, a significant improvement in HRQL, and reduced supplemental short-acting beta-agonist requirement, although this effect was not consistent. Additional studies are needed to assess the relative effects of combining therapies, using validated subjective measurements, and should consider concordance and the convenience of people having to use different inhaler devices.</P>

</ABSTRACT>
<BODY MODIFIED="2008-07-04 14:24:37 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND>
<P>This review has been created from an original protocol which was initiated to assess the relative effects of ipratropium bromide and short-acting beta-agonists. However, after the initial registration of this topic, a newer class of long acting beta-agonists (LABA) were developed, and there has been debate comparing the clinical benefit of both treatments in people with severely compromised lung function and daily activity (<LINK REF="REF-Appleton-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Appleton 2001</LINK>). </P>
<P>Despite the lack of major reversibility of airways obstruction, patients often report symptomatic improvement with bronchodilator therapy, and such agents are widely recommended in management guidelines for symptomatic COPD (<LINK REF="REF-ATS_x002f_ERS-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">ATS/ERS 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NICE_x002f_BTS-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE/BTS 2004</LINK>), even though they do not slow the decline in lung function. </P>
<P>Anticholinergic medicines (such as ipratropium bromide) act on muscarinic receptors, whereas LABAs (salmeterol or formoterol) act via the adrenergic system to cause bronchodilation. These bronchodilators can be delivered in several ways, e.g. by metered dose inhaler, dry powder device or by nebulisation. Some studies demonstrate that ipratropium bromide is at least as effective as short acting beta-2 agonists (<LINK REF="REF-Chapman-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chapman 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Matera-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Matera 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nisar-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nisar 1992</LINK>). Ipratropium bromide may be more efficacious than beta-2 agonists in the predominantly elderly COPD patient population, as there may be a decline in response to beta-2 agonists with increasing age, possibly due to reduced receptor numbers (<LINK REF="REF-Ullah-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ullah 1981</LINK>). In addition, beta-2 agonists potentially have more side effects such as tachycardia and tremor than anticholinergic medicines. </P>
<P>The principal goals of bronchodilator therapy are to alleviate dyspnoea and symptoms, and improve exercise performance. Their main effect is to modify lung ventilatory mechanics and gas exchange. Anticholinergic-mediated bronchodilation occurs predominantly in the large conducting airways and beta-2 agonists act in the peripheral conducting airways. Theoretically, anticholinergic drugs could be more effective in patients with stable COPD than beta-2 adrenergic receptor agonists because of the increased cholinergically- mediated smooth muscle tone which occurs in COPD. It has been suggested that this may be the only reversible component of airways narrowing in COPD (<LINK REF="REF-Barnes-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barnes 1993</LINK>). Anticholinergics may have additional effects other than bronchodilation in that they may reduce mucous secretion. Also, the action of beta-2 agonists may be impaired due to restricted access of these drugs to their receptors due to bronchoconstriction in the peripheral airways. </P>
<P>The aim of this review was to compare the relative efficacy and safety of regular long term use of shorter-acting anti-cholinergic medications alone or in combination with a long-acting beta-2 agonist compared with the long-acting beta-2 agonist alone, for people with stable COPD. </P>

<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>Non-asthmatic adults with stable COPD as defined by the British Thoracic Society (<LINK REF="REF-BTS-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">BTS 1997</LINK>). These guidelines specify COPD as a tobacco smoking related, chronic, slowly progressive disorder characterised by airways obstruction (FEV1 &lt; 80% predicted and FEV1/FVC ratio &lt; 70%) which does not change markedly over several months and where the impairment is largely fixed but is partially reversible by bronchodilator or other therapy. </P>
<P>'Stable' was defined as no recent infections, exacerbations, hospitalisation in the past month. </P>
<P>Studies which included participants with severe, concurrent other diseases, including cardiac, liver and renal disease were excluded. </P>
</CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>This review is limited to studies considering ipratropium bromide only, used regularly for at least four weeks in a stated dose, delivered via metered dose inhaler (MDI) or nebuliser, in an outpatient setting, in a randomised comparison with a LABA. Studies were included if they compared: </P>
<P>1) Ipratropium bromide versus LABA. <BR/>2) Ipratropium bromide + LABA versus LABA alone </P>
<P>The review protocol specified anticholinergic bronchodilators, and the study duration criteria had originally stipulated eight weeks, but this was revised down to four weeks minimum duration. This review was intended to examine all anti-cholinergic agents (including ipratropium bromide, oxitropium bromide, atropine methonitrate) versus LABA (including salmeterol and formoterol). The comparison with short-acting beta-2-agonists is considered in a separate Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-Appleton-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Appleton 2006</LINK>). </P>
<P>The efficacy of tiotropium bromide in comparison with LABA is examined in a separate Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-Barr-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barr 2005</LINK>). </P>

<P>We retrieved twenty-six studies (32 references). Of these nineteen were excluded for the following reasons: comparison with placebo and not beta-2 agonist (2), review articles (2), studies were of too short a duration (10), not RCTs (4), study participants had asthma only (1). Seven studies (presented in 13 published and unpublished references) recruiting a total of 2652 participants met the inclusion criteria. Two unpublished studies were identified from the online register of trials by GSK (<LINK REF="STD-SMS40314" TYPE="STUDY">SMS40314</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-SMS40315" TYPE="STUDY">SMS40315</LINK>).

</B>
<BR/>Four large studies (two published and two unpublished) comprising 1641 participants were identified which compared the effects of ipratropium bromide (42 mcg) with salmeterol (50 mcg) and placebo. Data from 1365 participants are included in the review (ipratropium N = 682, salmeterol N = 683). All medication was delivered by MDI for 8 to 12 weeks. A history of asthma was an exclusion criterion only in <LINK REF="STD-Mahler-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Mahler 1999</LINK>. In both published studies, participants were stratified and analyses were conducted according to their post-bronchodilator reversibility (FEV1 increase &lt; 12% and 200 mls after albuterol administration). Although baseline reversibility tests were not reported in the unpublished studies, we have opted to include them in this review and we have performed sensitivity analyses to see whether data from these studies could influence the size and direction of the summary estimates (<LINK REF="STD-SMS40314" TYPE="STUDY">SMS40314</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-SMS40315" TYPE="STUDY">SMS40315</LINK>).</P>
<P>Mean baseline FEV1 in <LINK REF="STD-Rennard-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Rennard 2001</LINK> was 1.22 litres and 1.28 litres in the salmeterol and ipratropium groups respectively. In <LINK REF="STD-Mahler-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Mahler 1999</LINK>, the baseline FEV1 in the salmeterol group was 1.36 litres (42.1% predicted) but it was 1.18 litres (37.0% predicted) in the ipratropium group. This difference between treatment groups was significant (P = 0.016). Current smoking status was not reported. Participants had a mean age of 63 years in both studies and there was a higher prevalence of males in <LINK REF="STD-Mahler-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Mahler 1999</LINK> (74%) than in <LINK REF="STD-Rennard-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Rennard 2001</LINK> (63%).

<I>Formoterol </I>
</B>
<BR/>Two studies were identified which compared formoterol with ipratropium.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Stahl-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Stahl 2002</LINK> randomised 183 participants for a 12 week comparison of ipratropium (80 mcg three times daily) with formoterol (18 mcg twice daily) and placebo (using a double dummy design). Measurements reported were health related quality of life (SGRQ scores), lung function, symptom scores, shuttle walking test distance and Borg dyspnoea scores. Unpublished data (standard errors) were obtained for the trial outcomes from one of the authors for the study. Mean baseline FEV1 of the patient group was 33% predicted. Participants in this study had non-reversible airways obstruction as defined as an increase in FEV1&lt; 12% of predicted normal value (and not of baseline) after inhalation of formoterol and ipratropium. Adult asthma was an exclusion criterion in this study. Mean age of participants was 64 years and males comprised 53%.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Dahl-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Dahl 2001</LINK> compared two doses of formoterol (12 mcg and 24 mcg) with ipratropium (40 mcg qid) and placebo (using a double dummy design) in 780 participants, over 12 weeks. Standard deviations were unpublished and not able to be obtained from the authors or drug company. Mean baseline FEV1 of the patient group was 1.30 litres or 45% predicted, current smoking ranged from 42 to 52.6%. Current or past diagnosis of asthma was an exclusion criterion. For comparison with the Stahl study, approximately 60% of participants presented with a change in FEV1 &lt; 15% and 200 ml after inhalation of salbutamol. Mean age of participants was 63 years and males comprised 75%.</P>
<P>
<B>Ipratropium bromide plus long acting beta-2 agonist versus long acting beta-2 agonist </B>
<BR/>Data for one published (<LINK REF="STD-van-Noord-2000" TYPE="STUDY">van Noord 2000</LINK>) and two unpublished studies (<LINK REF="STD-SMS40314" TYPE="STUDY">SMS40314</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-SMS40315" TYPE="STUDY">SMS40315</LINK>) comparing ipratropium in addition to salmeterol versus salmeterol were identified. These studies recruited 991 participants, and assessed treatment for between 8 to 12 weeks. Mean baseline FEV1 of the study population as reported in <LINK REF="STD-van-Noord-2000" TYPE="STUDY">van Noord 2000</LINK> was 1.33 litres. No baseline lung function data were available for the unpublished studies. In <LINK REF="STD-van-Noord-2000" TYPE="STUDY">van Noord 2000</LINK>, 57% of people in the combination therapy group were current smokers compared with 49% in the salmeterol group. <LINK REF="STD-van-Noord-2000" TYPE="STUDY">van Noord 2000</LINK> compared MDI delivered salmeterol (50 mcg bid) plus ipratropium (40 mcg qid) with salmeterol (50 mcg bid) and placebo using a double dummy design. In these two studies, participants had no history of asthma, allergic rhinitis or atopy. Participants demonstrated mean FEV1 reversibility of 6% of predicted value, or 13% of baseline.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2008-07-03 16:12:04 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>We have analysed evidence from seven studies in this review. The information available on the methodological design of the studies suggested that they were of high quality. The disparate reporting of outcome and limited availability of outcome data from these studies have limited the number of pooled analyses that we have been able to conduct. Evidence from these studies indicates that whilst salmeterol led to a greater improvement in one lung function variable, the effect was not consistent. The difference between salmeterol and ipratropium as monotherapies on subjective outcome was not significant. The combination of ipratropium and salmeterol was significantly more effective than salmeterol alone. There was evidence of improved quality of life with combination therapy over salmeterol alone, and reduced requirement for supplemental short-acting beta-agonist.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Effects of ipratropium bromide alone versus a long-acting beta-2 agonist </HEADING>
<P>Pooled analysis for a limited number of outcomes of all four studies which measured effectiveness of ipratropium in comparison with salmeterol (and placebo) over 12 weeks (<LINK REF="STD-Mahler-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Mahler 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rennard-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Rennard 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-SMS40314" TYPE="STUDY">SMS40314</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-SMS40315" TYPE="STUDY">SMS40315</LINK>), was possible after unpublished data were identified and analysed. This showed a benefit of salmeterol over ipratropium on certain lung function outcomes (change in morning PEF, FEV1) but no significant differences on subjective, validated measurements of health status or symptoms. The likelihood of study withdrawal due to adverse events or lack of efficacy was not significantly different between the two therapies, and the frequency of any adverse event was also not significantly different.</P>
<P>Although the 12-week data significantly favoured salmeterol over IpB, <LINK REF="STD-Mahler-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Mahler 1999</LINK> reported that at week 12, the FEV1 response over the pretreatment baseline to a single dose of salmeterol over 12 hours was not significantly different to the response to two doses of ipratropium except at time = 0, 4 and 6 hours. The differences at the 4 and 6 hour time points probably reflect the short duration of action of ipratropium and comparisons between salmeterol and the long-acting tiotropium are probably more appropriate. The treatment difference of approximately 150 ml at time zero- i.e. day 84 trough compared to the day 1 FEV1 baseline suggests a clinically meaningful benefit of salmeterol. This conferred few other benefits. The four studies did not show a significant difference in Transition Dyspnoea Index scores. However, <LINK REF="STD-Mahler-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Mahler 1999</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Rennard-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Rennard 2001</LINK> found no difference between treatments in six minute walk distance or post walk dyspnoea (Borg scores) and haemodynamic effects.</P>
<P>Two studies have compared the effects of formoterol and IpB but pooled analysis was not possible as the missing data were not obtainable. <LINK REF="STD-Dahl-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Dahl 2001</LINK> compared formoterol at 12 and 24 mcg, whereas <LINK REF="STD-Stahl-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Stahl 2002</LINK> compared the 24 mcg dose only with IpB. Both studies showed that the drugs were comparable in terms of the adverse events and haemodynamic effects, and formoterol treatment was associated with statistically significant higher morning PEF compared with ipratropium. Comparisons of the results of the studies show inconsistencies with the 24 mcg formoterol dose with respect to lung function, and SGRQ scores. Considered in isolation, and therefore with caution, the findings from <LINK REF="STD-Dahl-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Dahl 2001</LINK> suggest that the 12 mcg dose of formoterol has benefits over ipratropium. These inconsistencies highlight the need for meta-analyses to explore the size and consistency of an effect across different studies.</P>
<P>There was some variation in the inclusion criteria between these studies. Participants in <LINK REF="STD-Stahl-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Stahl 2002</LINK> had no history of adult asthma and exhibited bronchodilator reversibility of FEV1 &lt; 12% of predicted normal value after inhalation of formoterol and ipratropium. This allows for a relatively large reversibility however, but it is possible that the limited benefits in the study may reflect this inclusion criteria. Participants in <LINK REF="STD-Mahler-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Mahler 1999</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Rennard-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Rennard 2001</LINK> were stratified and analyses were conducted according to their post-bronchodilator reversibility of FEV1 (= 12% and = 200 mls). There is clearly a body of opinion (<LINK REF="REF-Anthonisen-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anthonisen 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Calverly-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Calverly 2003</LINK>) that suggests that a bronchodilator response should not be used as a criterion on which to base decisions about long-term treatment of COPD patients with bronchodilator drugs. However, there is also evidence emerging from studies that compare the effects of bronchodilators in participants with and without bronchodilator responses and it is apparent that firstly non-responsive participants comprise a significant proportion of the COPD population (around 50% of the recruited patients) (<LINK REF="REF-Mahler-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mahler 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rossi-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rossi 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tashkin-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tashkin 2003</LINK>) and while a non-responsive fraction experience some significant benefits, the benefits are in the order of half the magnitude of those experienced by the responsive patients (<LINK REF="STD-Mahler-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Mahler 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rossi-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rossi 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mahler-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mahler 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tashkin-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tashkin 2003</LINK>). Given that the clinical benefits may become marginal for the non- or poorly responsive group, it is arguable that there is a need to determine the benefits in this and other sub-groups of COPD (based upon severity for example).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="2">Effects of ipratropium bromide in combination with a long-acting beta-2 agonist </HEADING>
<P>To date, one published and two unpublished studies have been conducted to determine the benefits of IpB-salmeterol combination therapy versus salmeterol alone in people with COPD. While no benefit of either treatment was observed in participants' morning pre-medication PEF values, clinic measured pre-bronchodilator lung function tests may have provided more accurate data of the effect of treatment. Combination therapy (<LINK REF="STD-van-Noord-2000" TYPE="STUDY">van Noord 2000</LINK>) resulted in significantly higher increases in post-bronchodilator lung function compared with the salmeterol treatment which may confer some clinical benefit (mean difference % predicted FEV1: 3%, approximately 130 ml, and mean difference in FVC: 5%). The post-bronchodilator benefits suggest a possible role for combination therapy in subjects with relatively fixed airways obstruction (mean FEV1 reversibility was 13%). However the treatments were comparable in terms of symptom reduction, rescue salbutamol use, and frequency of adverse events and COPD exacerbation rate and therefore the cost of the combination must be considered in light of this.</P>
<P>The quality of life data available indicate that there was a significant difference in the change in total SGRQ score in favour of combination therapy. Given that the comparison was between active treatments, this difference may be of some value when making a choice between these two therapies. The CRQ data available in <LINK REF="STD-van-Noord-2000" TYPE="STUDY">van Noord 2000</LINK> showed no clinically relevant improvements (0.5 units per question per domain) in any domain with either treatment. There were however, a significantly higher proportion of participants on combination therapy (approximately 39%) achieving clinically meaningful improvements in the Total CRQ score, compared with salmeterol therapy (13%). Furthermore, the prevalence of significant worsening of scores was 13% in the combination group and 26% in the salmeterol group and 21% in the placebo group. The deterioration in the CRQ Total score in the salmeterol group is difficult to explain given that the adverse event rate was similar across treatment groups and that salmeterol has been previously shown to be well tolerated (<LINK REF="REF-Boyd-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boyd 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ulrik-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ulrik 1995</LINK>). Until more studies are available which may enable meta-analyses, these data suggest that treatment should be targeted at those who demonstrate improvement in HRQL using validated disease specific instruments. It is also arguable that 12 weeks therapy is not long enough to detect HRQL changes in stable patients who, as the author claims, are being optimally managed (<LINK REF="STD-van-Noord-2000" TYPE="STUDY">van Noord 2000</LINK>). The small improvements in lung function obtained with combination therapy over LABA treatment may correlate with the significant effects in the SGRQ score. However, the lack of an effect and the low statistical power for the CRQ scores need to be interpreted with caution as they are drawn from a single study. Additional studies in this area would help to explore the effects of these drugs on different quality of life instruments.</P>
<P>It is difficult to draw conclusions about the relative efficacy of IpB alone or in combination with salmeterol or formoterol versus the LABA alone. Generally, objective benefits such as an increase in FEV1 of around 150 ml occurred in the absence of subjective benefits such as improved quality of life or symptom scores. When objective improvements conferred subjective improvements, this was the result of one study and the conclusions are limited. The additional cost of adding salmeterol or formoterol to ipratropium becomes an important issue to consider. Although the impact of the costs in terms of "who pays" varies between countries, and the costs of the drugs themselves will vary, it is clear that there are significant additional costs of ipratropium and LABA treatment over SABA treatment. In Australia, for example, the predicted government costs of supplying one month of treatment (MDI delivered) of salmeterol and ipratropium are eight fold and seven fold respectively over the cost of one months salbutamol supply (<LINK REF="REF-Cwealth-of-Aust-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cwealth of Aust 2000</LINK>). Nebulised therapy is more costly again and therefore the significant additional costs require consideration when benefits are of marginal clinical significance. This again highlights the need to identify individual patients who do benefit from these therapies.</P>
<P>A role for "N = 1 randomised trials" to identify patients who actually benefit from anticholinergic therapy has been suggested (<LINK REF="REF-van-Weel-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Weel 1998</LINK>). Patient preference, acquired with methodological validity, may be valuable to determine which drug or drug combination is appropriate for which patient. The relevance of patient preference has been demonstrated in a randomised double-blind crossover study (<LINK REF="REF-Blosser-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blosser 1995</LINK>) comparing the effects of ipratropium 36 mcg qid and salbutamol 180 mcg qid for seven days in 15 participants with COPD, which reported that the mean FEV1 after seven days therapy was not significantly different between the treatments. No difference in exercise tolerance or dyspnoea scores were reported at the end of the treatment interval. However, in a subjective evaluation of the treatments, seven participants favoured ipratropium, seven favoured albuterol and one had no preference. Importantly, only 5 of the 15 participants preferred the drug to which they showed greatest reversibility in FEV1. As this review has shown that there is little objective difference between any of the bronchodilator strategies, therapy should be targeted to those patients shown to benefit from it.</P>
<P>There is currently no evidence that bronchodilator therapy reduces the rate of decline in lung function which occurs in COPD (<LINK REF="REF-Anthonisen-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anthonisen 1994</LINK>), although there is some evidence of a significant change in FEV1 over a short term (<LINK REF="REF-Appleton-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Appleton 2006</LINK>). According to a review of COPD management guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-Ferguson-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ferguson 2000</LINK>), guidelines are inconsistent in their recommendations for the pharmacological management of COPD. While all recommend inhaled bronchodilators as first-line therapy, the BTS and ERS do not recommend preferential use of anticholinergic agents over beta-2 agonist as initial therapy (<LINK REF="REF-ATS_x002f_ERS-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">ATS/ERS 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NICE_x002f_BTS-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE/BTS 2004</LINK>). GOLD suggests that the choice between drugs and their combination depends upon availability of the drug and each patient's response but claims that long-acting bronchodilators are more effective than short-acting bronchodilators (<LINK REF="REF-GOLD-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">GOLD 2003</LINK>). Recently, the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Workshop Report (updated 2004) recommended the use of the longer acting anticholinergic medication- tiotropium for moderate to very severe COPD (<LINK REF="REF-GOLD-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">GOLD 2004</LINK>). All guidelines discuss the value of combination therapy but <LINK REF="REF-Pauwels-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pauwels 2000</LINK> states that there is no clear indication whether either type of agent or a combination of the two is the first choice. However, where implications for health care resources are considered, guidelines need to recommend a safe and cost-effective approach to the pharmacological management of COPD in the absence of evidence of clear benefits of one agent over another.</P>
<P>Given the general acceptance and recommendation of IpB/beta-2 agonist combination therapy for the treatment of patients with COPD, the superiority of the type of a LABA remains to be determined. To date only one study (<LINK REF="REF-D_x0027_Urzo-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">D'Urzo 2001</LINK>), a randomised, double blind, cross-over trial, has been reported, comparing IpB (40 mcg qid) plus formoterol (12 mcg bd) and IpB plus salbutamol (200 mcg qid). Evaluation after 3 weeks of treatment demonstrated statistically significant increases in mean pre-bronchodilator PEF (12 litres/min) and FEV1 (0.120 litres) values with the formoterol/ipratropium combination compared with the salbutamol/ipratropium combination. Post-bronchodilator FEV1 values were also shown to be significantly increased with the formoterol combination (in the order of 0.150 litres). These marginal clinical benefits will need to be weighed against the additional costs of adding a long-acting beta-2 agonist to ipratropium.</P>
<P>The findings of this review should be seen in a general context and not limited to the consideration of single variables. There is accumulating evidence which suggests that spirometric measurements of FEV1 and FVC may not be the best measures of bronchodilator response in COPD, and there is evidence of a relationship between exacerbations and the deterioration in health-related quality of life in COPD (<LINK REF="REF-Spencer-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spencer 2004</LINK>). The findings on some of the subjective outcomes, whilst apparently unsupported by the lung function data, do nevertheless give some guidance on the use of these bronchodilating agents. The role of spirometry in evaluating therapeutic responses has been reviewed (<LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Donnell-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Donnell 2000</LINK>). In advanced COPD, exertional dyspnoea has been correlated with the level of dynamic lung hyperinflation (DH) (<LINK REF="REF-Belman-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Belman 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Donnell-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Donnell 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Donnell-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Donnell 1998</LINK>) as measured by inspiratory capacity (IC). Furthermore, a RCT using cross-over study design with three week treatment arms of ipratropium and placebo (<LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Donnell-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Donnell 1999</LINK>) showed that of the available spirometric parameters which indirectly measure reduced lung hyperinflation, IC correlated better than expiratory flow measurements, with reduced dyspnoea and improvements in exercise tolerance. An increases in IC of 10% predicted (0.3 L) was associated with a significant increase (&gt; 25%) in exercise endurance time. Perhaps, most significantly, the improvements in IC and exercise tolerance after ipratropium treatment occurred in a proportion of participants (31%) who showed little or no improvement in FEV1 (&lt; 10% predicted). Future critical evaluation of the benefits of bronchodilator therapy will require the incorporation of measurements of lung hyperinflation in spirometric assessments, in addition to measures of symptoms, exercise tolerance and HRQL and longer trial duration to detect critical events such as hospitalisations due to exacerbations.</P>

</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>Results from the trials included in the review indicate that when assessed as a monotherapy, salmeterol confers benefit in terms of lung function over ipratropium bromide, but the effects on subjective measurements are more equivocal. While studies showed that ipratropium and long-acting beta-2 agonists yielded benefits, there is currently insufficient evidence to make conclusions about the superiority of ipratropium versus either salmeterol or formoterol, given the inconsistent results reported across studies. There was evidence of benefit of ipratropium in combination with salmeterol, with significant improvements in post-bronchodilator FEV1, in addition to some HRQL benefits, and a reduced requirement for supplemental short-acting beta-agonist over salmeterol alone. </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>The relative value of ipratropium therapy alone or in combination with long acting beta-2 agonists needs still to be determined in studies which measure outcomes such as measures of inspiratory capacity or dynamic hyperinflation in combination with other measures such as exercise tolerance, dyspnoea scores, HRQL and effects on exacerbation rates. Studies should incorporate measures of health utilisation measures and need to be of longer duration to capture effects on exacerbation rates. The important issue of patient preferences need to be considered in future studies, the convenience of having to manipulate more than one inhaler device (with potentially different dosing regimens), as does the question of how therapy is escalated in COPD. It is arguable however that given the emergence of the long-acting anticholinergic tiotropium on to the market, future studies should focus on the evaluation of this therapy using relevant outcomes, for long term use in COPD, including comparisons with existing effective therapies. Its relative cost effectiveness also needs to be considered. </P>
