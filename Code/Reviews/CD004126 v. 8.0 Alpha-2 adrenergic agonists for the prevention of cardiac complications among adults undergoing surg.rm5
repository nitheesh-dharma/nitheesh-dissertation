Each year, about 300 million people undergo major surgery, of whom nine million experience serious heart complications. These complications may occur, in part, because surgery places a large stress on the heart. This stress can lead to high blood pressure and high heart rates during surgery, neither of which are good for the heart. Alpha-2 adrenergic agonists are a group of medicines that can prevent the blood pressure and heart rate from increasing during surgery. Thus, these medicines may also protect the heart from the stress of surgery. We wanted to find out if giving these medicines around the time of surgery could protect the heart from the stress of surgery and thus prevent major heart complications.</P><P><B>Study characteristics</B></P><P>We found 47 studies that were published up to May 2017. These studies involved 17,039 adults who had major surgery. Twenty-four studies involved 2672 adults having heart surgery. Twenty-three studies involved 14,367 adults undergoing major operations other than heart surgery. Forty studies compared alpha-2 adrenergic agonists to dummy treatment (placebo). The other seven studies compared them to other medicines. Twenty-one studies tested an alpha-2 adrenergic agonist medicine called clonidine, 24 studied another medicine called dexmedetomidine and two studied another medicine called mivazerol. The duration of alpha-2 adrenergic agonist medicine studied varied from one dose before surgery to three days of treatment. Most people who took part in these studies were men, and their average age was 60 to 70 years old. Fourteen studies reported receiving money from the company that manufactured the medicine being tested in the same study. Another 15 studies did not report where they received the money needed to fund the study. The number of people who took part in each study varied between 20 participants to as many as 10,000 participants. Nineteen studies included more than 100 participants.</P><P><B>Key results</B></P><P>We found that alpha-2 adrenergic agonists generally had no clear benefits for preventing death or major complications after surgery. For people having major operations other than heart surgery, alpha-2 adrenergic agonists did not lower their chances of dying, having a heart attack or having a stroke after surgery. We did not find sufficient evidence that, in people having heart surgery, alpha-2 adrenergic lowered the risk of dying or having a heart attack after surgery. There was some very limited evidence that these medicines might prevent strokes after heart surgery. Nonetheless, more research is needed before we can be certain that alpha-2 adrenergic agonists truly have this benefit. These medicines also had some important side effects. People who received alpha-2 adrenergic agonists were much more likely to have low blood pressures or low heart rates during or after surgery.</P><P><B>Quality of evidence</B></P><P>We assessed the quality of all studies we identified using a specialized tool called the GRADE criteria. In general, we found that most of the evidence in these studies was moderate or high quality. Thus, based on our results, we can be reasonably certain that alpha-2 adrenergic agonists are not helpful for reducing the numbers of deaths or major heart complications that happen after surgery.</P></SUMMARY_BODY></SUMMARY><ABSTRACT MODIFIED="2018-03-02 15:16:01 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2016-10-20 19:41:05 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>The surgical stress response plays an important role on the pathogenesis of perioperative cardiac complications.

Additionally, the risk of cardiac mortality was similar between treatment groups (0.8% with &#945;-2 adrenergic agonists versus 1.0% with control; RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.60 to 1.23; participants = 12,525; studies = 5, high quality evidence).

For example, about 3% of people who undergo major non-cardiac surgery experience perioperative myocardial infarction (MI) (<LINK REF="REF-VISION-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">VISION 2014</LINK>). Major cardiac complications, such as MI, lead to increased mortality, hospital stay and costs (<LINK REF="REF-Fleischmann-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fleischmann 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Force-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Force 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-VISION-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">VISION 2014</LINK>). The surgical stress response may play an important role in the pathogenesis of these complications. Specifically, surgical stress stimulates the sympathetic nervous system, which in turns leads to increased plasma levels of norepinephrine and epinephrine (<LINK REF="REF-Halter-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Halter 1997</LINK>). These effects increase blood pressure and heart rate, which can predispose the myocardium to ischaemia, especially in people with decreased coronary blood flow reserve.</P></CONDITION><INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2018-02-26 03:13:22 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Alpha-2 (&#945;-2) adrenergic agonists selectively bind to presynaptic &#945;-2 adrenergic receptors to activate a negative feedback mechanism that inhibits central sympathetic outflow (<LINK REF="REF-Muzi-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Muzi 1992</LINK>). These receptors are mainly located in the central nervous system, specifically in the brain stem and locus coeruleus. Activation of these receptors lead to hypotension, bradycardia, central sedation, anxiolysis and analgesia. Three specific &#945;-2 adrenergic agonists that have been evaluated in people undergoing surgery, namely clonidine, dexmedetomidine and mivazerol. Clonidine and dexmedetomidine are available for clinical use, while the use of mivazerol has been restricted to clinical trials. Clonidine has a half-life of 12 to 18 hours with excellent bioavailability, lending to its suitability for once daily administration in oral tablet or transdermal patch forms. An intravenous (IV) formulation of clonidine is also available. Dexmedetomidine has a shorter half-life of only two hours and variable bioavailability, consequently making it more suited for administration as a continuous IV infusion (<LINK REF="REF-Flood-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Flood 2015</LINK>). Similarly, mivazerol is also administered as a continuous IV infusion (<LINK REF="STD-Oliver-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Oliver 1999</LINK>).</P></INTERVENTION><THEORY MODIFIED="2018-02-26 03:13:46 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>As indicated above, &#945;-2 adrenergic agonists inhibit central sympathetic outflow. Hence, they can attenuate perioperative haemodynamic abnormalities (<LINK REF="STD-Ellis-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Ellis 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McSPI_x002d_Europe-1997" TYPE="STUDY">McSPI-Europe 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Talke-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Talke 1995</LINK>), and perhaps also prevent cardiac complications. Furthermore, clonidine has the unique ability to reduce sympathetic activity without blunting the baroreflex, which is critical for responding to the fluctuations in circulating blood volume often encountered during surgery (<LINK REF="REF-Muzi-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Muzi 1992</LINK>). Nonetheless, &#945;-2 adrenergic agonists have important adverse effects, including hypotension and bradycardia (<LINK REF="REF-Biccard-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Biccard 2008</LINK>). These haemodynamic effects may have clinically important consequences for people undergoing surgery. For example, in the Perioperative Ischemic Evaluation - 1 (POISE-1) randomized controlled trial (RCT), acute perioperative &#946;-blockade increased risks of bradycardia, hypotension, acute stroke, and death (<LINK REF="REF-POISE-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">POISE 2008</LINK>). Given that &#945;-2 adrenergic agonists have both potential benefits and adverse effects, a quantitative systematic review may help determine their overall efficacy and safety.</P></THEORY><IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2018-02-26 03:13:59 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Previous systematic reviews of perioperative &#945;-2 adrenergic agonists have been published (<LINK REF="REF-Biccard-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Biccard 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nishina-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nishina 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stevens-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stevens 2003</LINK>). However, two of them were restricted to individual &#945;-2 adrenergic agonists, namely clonidine (<LINK REF="REF-Nishina-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nishina 2002</LINK>), and dexmedetomidine (<LINK REF="REF-Biccard-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Biccard 2008</LINK>). The other review was restricted to studies published before 2002 (<LINK REF="REF-Stevens-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stevens 2003</LINK>). A systematic review according to the Cochrane methodology is therefore justified. The current review is an update to a previous Cochrane Review that included studies published before August 2008 (<LINK REF="REF-Wijeysundera-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wijeysundera 2009</LINK>). This update was deemed necessary, in part, given the publication of the largest RCT to-date of perioperative &#945;-2 adrenergic agonists, the Perioperative Ischemic Evaluation - 2 (POISE-2) trial (<LINK REF="STD-Devereaux-2014a" TYPE="STUDY">Devereaux 2014a</LINK>).</P></IMPORTANCE></BACKGROUND><OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2018-02-26 03:14:39 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>To determine the efficacy and safety of &#945;-2 adrenergic agonists for reducing mortality and cardiac complications in adults undergoing cardiac surgery and non-cardiac surgery. </P></OBJECTIVES><METHODS MODIFIED="2018-03-02 10:27:11 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2018-02-26 03:15:48 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><CRIT_STUDIES MODIFIED="2018-02-26 03:14:44 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>We included published RCTs.</P></CRIT_STUDIES><CRIT_PARTICIPANTS MODIFIED="2018-02-26 03:14:54 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>We included adults (aged 18 years or older) undergoing surgery under general anaesthesia, neuraxial anaesthesia, or both.

We generated 'Summary of findings' tables that separately presented pooled treatment effect estimates for the subgroups of participants who underwent non-cardiac surgery and cardiac surgery.

The GRADE approach rates quality of evidence as high, moderate, low or very low (<LINK REF="REF-GRADE-Handbook-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">GRADE Handbook 2013</LINK>). Since all data included in this review were from RCTs, the quality of evidence for each outcome of interest was initially rated as high level, and then potentially downgraded up to three levels based on any deficiencies in the quality of the underlying evidence. The quality of evidence underlying each pooled treatment effect estimate was assessed with respect to the risk of bias, inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision and publication bias (<LINK REF="REF-Balshem-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Balshem 2011</LINK>). The anticipated risk for comparison of each outcome was determined based on the event rate in the control group. Only outcomes judged as critically important, based on their impact on patient health or clinical decision-making, were chosen for presentation in the 'Summary of findings' tables. In this present review, we included the following outcomes in the 'Summary of findings' tables, provided that relevant estimated pooled treatment effects were present: all-cause mortality, cardiac mortality, MI, acute stroke, bradycardia and hypotension.</P></SUBSECTION></SENSITIVITY_ANALYSIS></DATA_COLLECTION></METHODS><RESULTS MODIFIED="2018-03-02 10:35:50 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><STUDY_DESCRIPTION MODIFIED="2018-03-02 10:28:27 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><SEARCH_RESULTS MODIFIED="2018-02-26 03:21:15 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Our search results are presented in <LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>.

These findings remained stable in sensitivity analyses restricted to studies that either demonstrated low risks of bias or employed strict definitions of MI. Aside from lacking any beneficial effect on these clinical outcomes, &#945;-2 adrenergic agonists also conferred important risks, specifically increased rates of hypotension and bradycardia. While these haemodynamic effects were not associated with an increased risk of acute stroke, the 95% CIs for this pooled effect were wide (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.56), thereby not excluding the possibility of a moderate increase in stroke risk with perioperative &#945;-2 adrenergic agonists.</P></SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS><APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2018-02-26 17:20:00 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>The 47 RCTs included in this systematic review encompassed 17,039 participants, a wide range of relevant surgical procedures performed in several different countries internationally and clinically relevant dosing regimens of currently available &#945;-2 adrenergic agonists (i.e. clonidine, dexmedetomidine). Furthermore, a significant number of participants from the included studies underwent surgery within the past decade. Thus, we are confident that the overall findings of our systematic review, namely that &#945;-2 adrenergic agonists do not significantly reduce risks of cardiovascular complications or mortality when given prophylactically before major non-cardiac or cardiac surgery, can be reasonably extrapolated to contemporary perioperative practice.</P><P>Nonetheless, there were insufficient participants within specific subgroups to conclusively evaluate several potential benefits of &#945;-2 adrenergic agonists, namely prevention of stroke, myocardial ischaemia and all-cause mortality after cardiac surgery. The subgroup analysis evaluating effects on stroke during cardiac surgery was small, with only seven included studies that encompassed 1175 participants (<LINK REF="CMP-002.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.6</LINK>). The pooled estimate was based on low-quality data, calculated using very few outcome events (i.e. 18 strokes). Previous research has found that treatment effects are generally overestimated in meta-analyses that include relatively few outcome events (<LINK REF="REF-Thorlund-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thorlund 2011</LINK>). Consistent with this possibility, the magnitude of the pooled estimate was somewhat implausible (RR 0.37, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.93), in that it suggested a 63% relative reduction in the risk of stroke from a single perioperative intervention. Therefore, further research is needed to determine whether &#945;-2 adrenergic agonists can truly reduce the risk of acute stroke after cardiac surgery.</P><P>Similarly, the statistically significant pooled treatment effect on all-cause mortality was observed only in a post-hoc subset analysis restricted to cardiac surgery trials conducted after 1997 (<LINK REF="CMP-010.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 10.1</LINK>). This subset was relatively small (13 studies encompassing 1782 participants), the pooled estimated was calculated using very few outcome events (i.e. 28 deaths) and the magnitude of the pooled estimate was somewhat implausible (RR 0.47, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.97) for a single intervention. More studies are needed to assess the effect of &#945;-2 adrenergic agonists on all-cause mortality after cardiac surgery.</P><P>In a separate subgroup analysis in cardiac surgery, &#945;-2 adrenergic agonists also caused a significant reduction in perioperative myocardial ischaemia (<LINK REF="CMP-002.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.3</LINK>). Nonetheless, myocardial ischaemia is a surrogate outcome with important associated limitations (<LINK REF="REF-Svensson-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Svensson 2013</LINK>). Especially in the absence of associated reductions in clinical important and patient-relevant outcomes such as mortality or MI, isolated reductions in perioperative myocardial ischaemia are not sufficient justifications for employing &#945;-2 adrenergic agonists in clinical practice.</P></APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS><QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2018-02-26 17:22:24 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>This systematic review was supported by 47 RCTs that recruited 17,039 participants. The sample size of the included RCTs varied greatly, ranging from 20 to over 10,000 participants. Nineteen studies had over 100 participants, with only two studies involving over 1000 participants (<LINK REF="STD-Devereaux-2014a" TYPE="STUDY">Devereaux 2014a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Oliver-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Oliver 1999</LINK>). The vast majority of these participants (14,367) were recruited into the 23 included trials in non-cardiac surgery. By comparison, the remaining 24 RCTs in cardiac surgery involved 2672 participants.</P><P>Only 16 studies reported adequate methods for random sequence generation and allocation concealment. Furthermore, although 31 studies described themselves as 'double-blinded,' only 21 studies reported appropriate methods to achieve blinding. Nonetheless, the majority of participants were from well-designed studies with adequate methods for allocation and blinding, thereby rendering them low risk to be influenced by selection bias, performance bias and detection bias.</P><P>The analyses pertaining to the primary and secondary outcomes in people undergoing non-cardiac surgery were generally robust. These findings were judged as moderate to high quality by GRADE methodology (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>). Although many studies failed to report adequate methods to avoid risk of bias, the specific outcomes were unlikely to be influenced and thus no downgrading of quality was necessary. In addition, there was a potential threat of indirectness since the second largest RCT evaluated mivazerol (<LINK REF="STD-Oliver-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Oliver 1999</LINK>), which is not available for clinical use. However, given the similarity of mivazerol to dexmedetomidine (which is available for clinical use), we reasoned that this risk was likely not serious. Conversely, funnel plots suggested that the pooled treatment effects on MI was affected by publication bias (<LINK REF="FIG-05" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 5</LINK>). The asymmetry in the funnel plots was produced by two small studies with seemingly unrealistic effect sizes (<LINK REF="STD-Ellis-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Ellis 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stuhmeier-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Stuhmeier 1996</LINK>). While the combined weight of these studies was less than 3% of the pooled analysis, we downgraded the evidence by one level because of suspicion of publication bias for an outcome known to be influenced by performance bias (<LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>). Finally, the quality of evidence for the physiological effects of bradycardia and hypotension were both downgraded because of substantial heterogeneity (I<SUP>2</SUP> greater than 50%) in the analyses (<LINK REF="CMP-001.08" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.8</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-001.09" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.9</LINK>).</P><P>The quality of evidence for the effects of &#945;-2 adrenergic agonists in cardiac surgery was generally lower, largely due to imprecision resulting from significantly fewer participants in the pooled analyses (<LINK REF="SOF-02" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 2</LINK>). The quality of evidence for all outcomes was downgraded because the optimal information size of 2000 participants was not achieved, and the 95% CIs of the pooled estimates did not rule out clinically significant effects (<LINK REF="REF-GRADE-Handbook-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">GRADE Handbook 2013</LINK>). Thus, the quality of evidence for the analyses pertaining to all-cause mortality and MI was moderate. As there were very few outcomes events in the analysis of acute stroke (i.e. 18 strokes), it was downgraded another level and judged as low quality. Finally, the presence of substantial imprecision in pooled analysis pertaining to hypotension led to the quality of this evidence being downgraded to low (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 72%; <LINK REF="CMP-002.08" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.8</LINK>). Nonetheless, the magnitude of the association between &#945;-2 adrenergic agonists and hypotension in cardiac surgery (RR 1.19, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.64) was qualitatively very similar to that observed in non-cardiac surgery (RR 1.24, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.48), where the quality of evidence was moderate.</P></QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE><POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2018-02-26 17:22:42 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>There were several limitations to our review process. First, while our search was exhaustive in that it covered all major medical indexes and clinical trial registries, we might have missed some published trials only listed in other less commonly used indices. Nonetheless, we believe it unlikely that our search strategy missed any relevant studies of at least moderate size and quality. Second, we only included studies reporting subgroup-specific outcome data based on surgical procedure type (i.e. cardiac surgery versus non-cardiac surgery). Consequently, we excluded any study that did not predominantly include procedures (greater than 75%) from either of these surgical procedure subgroup, unless subgroup-specific outcome data could be obtained from the authors. Consequently, two otherwise eligible studies could not be included in this systematic review (<LINK REF="STD-Martin-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Martin 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Triltsch-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Triltsch 2002</LINK>). In excluding these studies, we balanced the risk of biasing the analyses with the loss of additional data, and chose the latter to maintain the integrity of our analyses.</P></POTENTIAL_BIASES><AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2018-02-26 17:26:11 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>There are several potential reasons why the theoretically beneficial physiological effects of &#945;-2 adrenergic agonists did not translate into reduced rates of major postoperative cardiac complications. First, &#945;-2 adrenergic agonists might not have sufficiently reduced heart rates to mitigate the risks of perioperative MI, as has been previously proposed (<LINK REF="STD-Devereaux-2014a" TYPE="STUDY">Devereaux 2014a</LINK>). This hypothesis is supported by the observation that, while perioperative &#946;-blockers caused more significant bradycardia than &#945;-2 adrenergic agonists, rates of perioperative MI were reduced with &#946;-blockers but not &#945;-2 adrenergic agonists (<LINK REF="REF-Wijeysundera-2014b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wijeysundera 2014b</LINK>). Second, the predominant mechanism underlying perioperative MI in many affected people might not be increases in blood pressure and heart rate induced by the surgical stress response. For example, almost 30% of people with postoperative MI do not have significant obstructive coronary artery disease (<LINK REF="REF-Sheth-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sheth 2015</LINK>). It is unlikely that limiting perioperative increases in heart rate would help prevent MI in such people. Third, at a population-level, the beneficial effects of heart rate reduction in some people undergoing surgery might have been offset by equal numbers of people who experienced deleterious effects from significant perioperative hypotension.</P><P>Notably, our overall findings with respect to the absence of major reductions in perioperative cardiovascular risk from &#945;-2 adrenergic agonists was somewhat consistent with results seen with prophylactic therapy with other sympatholytic agents. Specifically, &#946;-adrenergic blockers have been shown to cause a net harmful effect in non-cardiac surgery (<LINK REF="REF-Wijeysundera-2014b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wijeysundera 2014b</LINK>). It remains to be seen whether any strategy of prophylactically attenuating haemodynamic abnormalities with sympatholytic agents can safely reduce perioperative cardiac risk. Indeed, if future RCTs with either alternative regimens of previously evaluated sympatholytic agents (i.e. &#945;-2 adrenergic agonists, &#946;-adrenergic blockers) or alternative negative chronotropic agents (e.g. ivabradine) fail to show net overall benefit, the general strategy for perioperative cardiac risk reduction may have to shift from <I>prophylactic therapy</I> to <I>early treatment</I>. Specifically, as opposed to administering these medications to a broad group of people before surgery, clinicians might instead consider targeting treatment in high-risk people identified on the basis of ischaemic ECG changes or elevated cardiac troponin concentrations early after surgery.</P><P>Comparison of our present systematic review on perioperative &#945;-2 adrenergic agonists with a prior systematic review of perioperative &#946;-adrenergic blockers in non-cardiac surgery also provides some potential insights into the mechanisms underlying perioperative stroke (<LINK REF="REF-Wijeysundera-2014b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wijeysundera 2014b</LINK>). Specifically, &#945;-2 adrenergic agonists (RR 1.24, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.48) and &#946;-adrenergic blockers (RR 1.47, 95% CI 1.34 to 1.60) conferred approximately similar risks of perioperative hypotension. Despite this similarity in haemodynamic effects, &#946;-blockers (RR 1.86, 95% CI 1.09 to 3.16) conferred significantly increased risks of perioperative acute stroke while &#945;-2 adrenergic agonists did not (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.56). These contrasting effects are also evident when comparing two large individual perioperative RCTs of these two different drug classes, namely the POISE-1 trial of metoprolol (<LINK REF="REF-POISE-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">POISE 2008</LINK>) and the POISE-2 trial of clonidine (<LINK REF="STD-Devereaux-2014a" TYPE="STUDY">Devereaux 2014a</LINK>). Specifically, while metoprolol (hazard ratio (HR) 1.55, 95% CI 1.38 to 1.74) and clonidine (HR 1.32, 95% CI 1.24 to 1.40) caused qualitatively similar increases in rates of hypotension, metoprolol significantly increased risks of stroke (HR 2.17, 95% CI 1.26 to 3.74) while clonidine did not (HR 1.06, 95% CI 0.54 to 2.05). These findings suggest that, despite the previously observed association between perioperative hypotension and stroke (<LINK REF="REF-POISE-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">POISE 2008</LINK>), the mechanisms underlying perioperative acute stroke are likely more complex than simply a decrease in perfusion pressure. Further research is needed to better delineate these mechanisms, and thereby inform the development of strategies to help prevent this often devastating perioperative complication (<LINK REF="REF-POISE-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">POISE 2008</LINK>).</P><P>Importantly, perioperative &#945;-2 adrenergic agonists do have other potential benefits that may justify their selective use in some people undergoing surgery. Specifically, in a previous systematic review of 30 small RCTs encompassing 1792 participants, these agents decreased both postoperative pain intensity and morphine consumption (<LINK REF="REF-Blaudszun-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blaudszun 2012</LINK>). Our present study provided additional data supporting the safety of using &#945;-2 adrenergic agonists as an adjunct therapy for managing postoperative acute pain, provided that there is adequate attention to the associated risks of hypotension and bradycardia.</P><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="2"><I>Strengths</I></HEADING><P>Our present review had several strengths. The literature search was extensive and encompassed all languages. In addition, our study utilized a substantially larger data set than previous reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Biccard-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Biccard 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nishina-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nishina 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stevens-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stevens 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wijeysundera-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wijeysundera 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wijeysundera-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wijeysundera 2009</LINK>). Finally, we performed multiple sensitivity analyses to assess the potential influence of study quality, outcome definition and publication bias on our overall conclusions.</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="2"><I>Limitations</I></HEADING><P>Our review had several limitations that should be considered. First, the results were heavily influenced by two large trials of mivazerol (<LINK REF="STD-Oliver-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Oliver 1999</LINK>) and clonidine (<LINK REF="STD-Devereaux-2014a" TYPE="STUDY">Devereaux 2014a</LINK>) in non-cardiac surgery. While excluding these large trials from the meta-analysis resulted in somewhat more optimistic point estimates for individual pooled treatment effects, these pooled estimates remained statistically non-significant. Second, as with any systematic review, our results may have been affected by publication bias. Though funnel plots indicated no obvious bias in the reporting of death (all-cause and cardiac-cause), they did suggest reporting bias may be present for MI. Third, our present analysis pooled trials of &#945;-2 adrenergic agonists with differing selectivity for their target receptors, namely &#945;-2 adrenoceptors and non-adrenergic imidazoline receptors (<LINK REF="REF-Khan-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Khan 1999</LINK>). Specifically, both mivazerol and dexmedetomidine have considerably greater selectivity for these target receptors than clonidine. Furthermore, when comparing the two large individual trials that dominated this meta-analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Devereaux-2014a" TYPE="STUDY">Devereaux 2014a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Oliver-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Oliver 1999</LINK>), clonidine had no effect on mortality and increased rates of significant perioperative hypotension, while mivazerol, a more selective &#945;-2 adrenergic agonist that is not currently available for clinical use, was associated with trends towards reduced mortality and had no effect on rates of hypotension. Importantly, these contrasting findings might have also been due to the different time periods when the studies were conducted, differences in study design, differences in participant characteristics or chance. Nonetheless, the contrasting findings still suggest that any future RCT of &#945;-2 adrenergic agonists for cardiac risk reduction in people undergoing surgery should focus on agents with higher selectivity for &#945;-2 adrenoceptors, such as dexmedetomidine or mivazerol.</P></SUBSECTION></AGREEMENT></DISCUSSION><CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2018-02-26 17:27:34 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2018-02-26 17:26:26 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Our study found high-quality data to firmly conclude that there are no compelling reasons for employing perioperative &#945;-2 adrenergic agonists to reduce the risks of perioperative death or major cardiac complications in people undergoing surgery. These agents do not reduce the risks of death, myocardial infarction (MI) or acute stroke after surgery. Furthermore, they are associated with important adverse effects, namely increased risks of hypotension and bradycardia.</P></IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE><IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2018-02-26 17:27:34 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>First, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of clonidine for reducing perioperative cardiovascular risk should not be performed in the future because the Perioperative Ischemic Evaluation - 2 (POISE-2) trial provides compelling evidence that this specific agent lacks benefit. Second, while it is presently unclear whether more selective &#945;-2 adrenergic agonists, such as dexmedetomidine or mivazerol, have differing effects on clinical outcomes in comparison to clonidine, there are at least theoretical reasons to pursue this hypothesis in future trials. Thus, future RCTs of perioperative &#945;-2 adrenergic agonists should focus on these more selective agents. Any such future trial should also adhere to quality standards for RCTs including blinding (participants, caregivers, outcome adjudicators), allocation concealment and intention-to-treat analysis. Third, appropriately designed future RCTs are needed to determine whether more selective &#945;-2 adrenergic agonists can help prevent perioperative stroke or all-cause death after cardiac surgery.</P></IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH></CONCLUSIONS></BODY><ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS MODIFIED="2018-03-13 09:32:19 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>We would like to thank Rodrigo Cavallazz (content editor), Cathal D Walsh (statistical editor), Ben Gibbison, Pierre Foex, Ernst-Peter Horn (peer reviewers), Anne Lyddiatt (consumer referee) for their help and editorial advice during the preparation of this updated systematic review.</P><P>Dr Wijeysundera is supported in part by a New Investigator Award from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (Ottawa, Ontario, Canada).
