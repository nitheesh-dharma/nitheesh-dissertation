<DESCRIPTION>
<P>We added a sixth inclusion criterion to the protocol, that states that only studies in which the effect of the TFU can be isolated and analyzed, will be included. This extra inclusion criterium has no consequences for the search strategy, and no other studies will be included or excluded than was originally intended. The extra inclusion criterium was needed because studies wherein the effect of the TFU cannot be isolated do not add to the aim of this review. Moreover, the review is not intended to compare TFU interventions to multi-component interventions.</P>

<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Many patients encounter a variety of problems in the first weeks after they have been discharged from hospital to home. Telephone follow-up, initiated by hospital-based health professionals, is considered to be a good means of exchanging information, providing health education and advice, managing symptoms, recognising complications early and giving reassurance to patients after discharge. Some research has shown that telephone follow-up is feasible, and that patients appreciate such calls. However, until now it was not clear whether telephone follow-up is also effective. Our systematic review identified 33 relevant studies, almost all of which were of low methodological quality (a major limitation of the review). We found that telephone follow-up has been applied in many patient groups. There is great variety in the ways the telephone follow-up has been performed. Many different outcomes have been measured. Some studies found effects in favour of the telephone follow-up intervention, but overall studies identified no statistically significant differences between the telephone follow-up and control groups. For as far as the results of studies could be pooled together, we could draw no firm conclusions about the effects of telephone follow-up. No studies identified adverse effects of the intervention.</P>

</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>It is known that many patients encounter a variety of problems in the first weeks after they have been discharged from hospital to home. In recent years many projects have addressed discharge planning, with the aim of reducing problems after discharge. Telephone follow-up (TFU) is seen as a good means of exchanging information, providing health education and advice, managing symptoms, recognising complications early, giving reassurance and providing quality aftercare service. Some research has shown that telephone follow-up is feasible, and that patients appreciate such calls. However, at present it is not clear whether TFU is also effective in reducing postdischarge problems.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To assess the effects of follow-up telephone calls in the first month post discharge, initiated by hospital-based health professionals, to patients discharged from hospital to home.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>We searched the following databases from their start date to July 2003, without limits as to date of publication or language: the Cochrane Consumers and Communication Review Group's Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, <I>The Cochrane Library</I>), PubMed, EMBASE (OVID), BiomedCentral, CINAHL, ERIC (OVID), INVERT (Dutch nursing literature index), LILACS, Picarta (Dutch library system), PsycINFO/PsycLIT (OVID), the Combined Social and Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-E), SOCIOFILE. We searched for ongoing research in the following databases: National Research Register (http://www.update-software.com/nrr/); Controlled Clinical Trials (http://www.controlled-trials.com/); and Clinical Trials (http://clinicaltrials.gov/). We searched the reference lists of included studies and contacted researchers active in this area. </P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials of TFU initiated by a hospital-based health professional, for patients discharged home from an acute hospital setting. The intervention was delivered within the first month after discharge; outcomes were measured within 3 months after discharge, and either the TFU was the only intervention, or its effect could be analysed separately. </P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Two review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion and for methodological quality. The methodological quality of included studies was assessed using the criteria from the Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care Review Group. The data-extraction form was based on the template developed by the Cochrane Consumers and Communication Review Group. Data was extracted by one review author and checked by a second author. For as far it was considered that there was enough clinical homogeneity with regard to patient groups and measured outcomes, statistical pooling was planned using a random effects model and standardised mean differences for continuous scales and relative risks for dichotomous data, and tests for statistical heterogeneity were performed. </P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>We included 33 studies involving 5110 patients. Predominantly, the studies were of low methodological quality. TFU has been applied in many patient groups. There is a large variety in the ways the TFU was performed (the health professionals who undertook the TFU, frequency, structure, duration, etc.). Many different outcomes have been measured, but only a few were measured across more than one study. Effects are not constant across studies, nor within patient groups. Due to methodological and clinical diversity, quantitative pooling could only be performed for a few outcomes. Of the eight meta-analyses in this review, five showed considerable statistical heterogeneity. Overall, there was inconclusive evidence about the effects of TFU.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>The low methodological quality of the included studies means that results must be considered with caution. No adverse effects were reported. Nevertheless, although some studies find that the intervention had favourable effects for some outcomes, overall the studies show clinically-equivalent results between TFU and control groups. In summary, we cannot conclude that TFU is an effective intervention. </P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
</ABSTRACT>
<BODY MODIFIED="2008-05-14 10:04:03 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Megan Prictor">
<BACKGROUND>
<P>We know from several primary studies and literature reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Bull-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bull 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cole-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cole 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hyde-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hyde 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mistiaen-1999a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mistiaen 1999a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Parker-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parker 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shepperd-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shepperd 2004</LINK>) that many patients encounter a variety of problems in the first weeks after they have been discharged from hospital to home. These problems can include: difficulty with activities of daily living, emotional problems, knowledge deficit (for example, insufficient knowledge to understand symptoms or advice), insufficient help, uncertainty and anxiety, and informational needs (patient perceives a need for more information than given). For instance, Bull (<LINK REF="REF-Bull-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bull 2000</LINK>) states that 'people were given little information regarding their medications and condition, they had difficulty managing special diets, and they were often unclear about which activities they could engage in, or which ones they should avoid...In addition elders in one study had difficulty in evaluating symptoms and deciding whether a symptom was related to their medical condition or to the adverse effects of medication... Unmet information needs one week following hospital discharge were reported by 80% of elders... Problems with recognising the signs of complications, managing medication, diet and other aspects of treatment contributed to hospital readmission' (p. 71). Although postdischarge problems are not always major medical problems, patients often perceive them as giving discomfort (<LINK REF="REF-LeClerc-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">LeClerc 2002</LINK>). There is also empirical evidence that health professionals rate postdischarge problems in a different way to patients (<LINK REF="REF-Reiley-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reiley 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>Although generally-accepted definitions of postdischarge problems and the postdischarge period are lacking, and may vary across illnesses and treatment procedures, research has shown that postdischarge problems are most intense in the period immediately after hospital discharge. Naylor's review (<LINK REF="REF-Naylor-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Naylor 2002</LINK>) states that '4 to 6 weeks post discharge represents a critical period when many elders are at highest risk for poor discharge outcomes' and empirical research in a mixed population has shown that postdischarge problems are greater at 7 days post discharge than at 30 days post discharge (<LINK REF="REF-Mistiaen-1999b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mistiaen 1999b</LINK>).</P>
<P>Moreover, in western developed countries, there is a tendency for shorter hospital stays and a shift to one-day-stay procedures, restricting the time available for health professionals to prepare patients adequately for their transfer to home and for the postdischarge period. This may increase postdischarge problems. Many projects have addressed discharge planning, with the aim of reducing problems after discharge. The focus of most discharge planning projects is selecting patients at risk of postdischarge problems as soon as possible after admission, preparing them in a timely and adequate fashion for discharge, and organising discharge arrangements. These discharge planning efforts do not resolve all problems, however (<LINK REF="REF-Parker-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parker 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shepperd-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shepperd 2004</LINK>). Patients need not only discharge preparation but also adequate aftercare. Aftercare is given in many different forms and may consist of several components, yet there is no scientific evidence that these aftercare efforts have clear beneficial effects (<LINK REF="REF-Bours-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bours 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>Since a large proportion of postdischarge problems relate to informational needs, and patients are reluctant to bother healthcare providers with their questions, it can be assumed that active telephone follow-up, initiated by hospital-based health professionals, may be of relevance to the problems patients face after discharge. Telephone follow-up (TFU) is seen as a good means of exchanging information, providing health education and advice, managing symptoms, recognising complications early, giving reassurance and providing quality aftercare service. Cox et al (<LINK REF="REF-Cox-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cox 2003</LINK>) state that by telephone follow-up 'information can be reinforced, thereby increasing compliance, and ensuring the physical and emotional comfort of the patient'. Moreover, TFU is an intervention that is easy to organise and, in itself, does not cost a lot of money or time. The technology is available to almost all patients in western developed countries. Some research (<LINK REF="REF-Bowman-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bowman 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cave-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Cave 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Keeling-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Keeling 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kelly-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Kelly 1999</LINK>) has shown that TFU is feasible, and that patients are satisfied with the calls (<LINK REF="REF-Johnson-2000d" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnson 2000d</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moran-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moran 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schaeffer-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schaeffer 2001</LINK>). However, at present it is not clear whether TFU is also effective in reducing postdischarge problems. Studies so far show mixed results. For example, a randomised controlled trial of telephone follow-up versus usual care in ophthalmic surgery patients (<LINK REF="STD-Boter-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Boter 2000</LINK>) found no beneficial effects, except that patients valued the phone call. The authors of this study suggest that the no-effect might be due to outcome instruments that were not sensitive enough, or due to the non-problematic character of the patient group. But no-effect has also been demonstrated for more complex patient groups such as oncology patients (<LINK REF="STD-Beney-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Beney 2002</LINK>). On the other hand Beckie (<LINK REF="REF-Beckie-1989a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beckie 1989a</LINK>) found TFU (versus no TFU) to enhance knowledge with regard to self-care measures and to reduce anxiety after discharge in coronary artery bypass graft patients, although this could not be confirmed in a later study by Roebuck (<LINK REF="STD-Roebuck-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Roebuck 1999</LINK>). Finally, Hartford and Wong (<LINK REF="REF-Hartford-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hartford 2000</LINK>) conclude their narrative literature review that 'plagued by inadequate sample size and weak designs, only two RCTs of nurse-initiated telephone follow-up in coronary artery bypass graft patients had positive results' (p.32).</P>
<P>Therefore, this review aimed to determine the effects of TFU delivered in the first month after discharge, initiated by hospital-based health professionals, to patients discharged from hospital to home, with regard to psychosocial and physical outcomes in the first three months post discharge.</P>
<P>TFU is only one way of providing support after discharge; this review however focused solely on this form of care since Bours (<LINK REF="REF-Bours-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bours 1998</LINK>) performed a systematic (non-Cochrane) review of multicomponent aftercare and Johnson (<LINK REF="REF-Johnson-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnson 2003</LINK>) has prepared a Cochrane review of written and verbal information versus verbal information only for patients being discharged from acute hospital settings to home. Based on two trials, Johnson concludes that provision of verbal and written health information on discharge from hospital significantly increased knowledge and satisfaction scores. Bours states that the majority of the (seventeen) studies did not report clear beneficial effects in favour of the intervention (multicomponent aftercare) group.</P>

<P>Although we expected to find that most TFU interventions focus on outcomes such as reassurance and informational needs, we included also other types of outcomes because of the great variety of postdischarge problems.

<P>Telephone follow-up (TFU) initiated by a hospital-based health professional (medical, nursing, social work, pharmaceutical, ...) to a patient who is discharged to his/her own home setting (including a relative's home). The TFU has to be performed at least once within the first month after discharge. The TFU may have any kind of structure: for instance completely open ('how are you doing?') or completely structured. The TFU may contain one or more elements such as gathering of information, giving reassurance, giving advice on several topics, counseling, referral where required, etc.</P>
<P>The TFU has, in principle, to be targeted to the patients themselves. In cases where the patients themselves are not able to talk on the phone (eg. very young children, very sick people, patients with severe Alzheimer's disease) on one or more occasions when the TFU is delivered, these studies are included. On the data-extraction sheet the extent was noted to which the TFU was indirect, and separate analyses were conducted if appropriate for studies in which the intervention for the entire research population was delivered directly to the patients, and for studies in which the TFU was (partly) delivered to relatives/caregivers.

Since there is no generally-accepted definition of what a postdischarge period means, and the duration of postdischarge problems may vary for different illnesses and treatment procedures, the choice of a time period for study had to be arbitrary. However there is evidence, as stated earlier, that most postdischarge problems occur in the period immediately after discharge. Moreover three months is a period for which it is reasonable to assume that outcomes can be related to the intervention in the first month after discharge; it is not likely that if effects were not found in this immediate postdischarge time frame, effects would be found later .</P>

<BR/>We had planned to search the Cochrane EPOC Review Group's Specialised Register and the System for Information on Grey Literature in Europe (SIGLE), but SIGLE was no longer available in any European library and we were unable to access the EPOC Specialised Register.</P>
<P>We used the highly-sensitive strategy for the retrieval of controlled trials in PubMed, as proposed by Robinson and Dickersin (<LINK REF="REF-Robinson-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Robinson 2002</LINK>) and supported by the Dutch Cochrane Center (<LINK REF="APP-01" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 1</LINK>). For PubMed, the controlled trials strategy was combined by AND with topic-specific strategy detailed in <LINK REF="APP-02" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 2</LINK>
<BR/>
</P>
<P>We made appropriate variations of the PubMed strategy for the other databases; the strategies are listed at <LINK TAG="APPENDICES" TYPE="SECTION">Appendices</LINK> 3 to 13.</P>
<P>We located additional references by searching the reference lists of included studies and by contacting individuals known to be active in the field of discharge and/or telephone care. In September 2004 we performed a forward search based on the included papers in the Science Citation Index, to find more recent papers that cited one or more of the already included studies.</P>
<P>We sought to identify ongoing research by searching the following databases in August 2003:<BR/>

<DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2008-04-04 16:50:54 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Megan Prictor">
<P>Electronic searching in the 16 databases yielded a total of 14,572 citations and, after elimination of duplicates, 12,140 citations were left for initial sifting. This very large number of references is due to the fact that the telephone is used in many studies to collect data. It was impossible to make a distinction in the search strategies between telephone as data collection method and telephone as an intervention.</P>
<P>Throughout the review process, the review authors were not blind to authorship of trials.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Stage 1: initial sifting</HEADING>
<P>Two authors (PM, EP) independently checked a 10% random sample of these references, and as agreement between authors was more than 95%, further sifting at this stage was conducted by PM only. If the agreement whether to exclude studies between the two authors on the 10% sample was lower than 95%, it was planned the second author would proceed to check the other 90% of the sample. Where there was insufficient information from the title and/or abstract to determine relevance, we ordered the article in full text and proceeded to the second stage. This initial sifting against the inclusion criteria based on the title and abstract resulted in 340 potentially-relevant references.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Stage 2: inclusion procedure</HEADING>
<P>We retrieved these 340 citations in full text, and assessed them against the six inclusion criteria as follows:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>(randomised) controlled trial;</LI>
<LI>research participants are patients discharged from hospital to their own home;</LI>
<LI>intervention must be at least one TFU call initiated by a hospital-based health professional and, in principle, directed to the patients themselves;</LI>
<LI>intervention has to take place at least once within the first month after hospital discharge;</LI>
<LI>outcomes have to be measured at least once within the first three months after hospital discharge; and</LI>
<LI>if the TFU is part of multi-component intervention, the study reports data on the effects of the TFU-component, or its effects can be isolated and analysed to some degree.</LI>
</UL>
<P>For each study the criteria were judged from top to bottom; from the moment a criterion was not met no further assessment was made relating to the subsequent criteria.</P>
<P>At this second stage, all studies were checked by two review authors independently. Inter-rater agreement in this process was 94% with a kappa-coefficient of 0.75. We resolved disagreement on inclusion or exclusion was resolved by discussion. If no agreement could be reached, it was planned a third author would decide.</P>
<P>The process of searching and assessing studies against the review's inclusion criteria resulted in a set of 39 articles, describing 32 studies. We conducted a forward search with these 39 references in the combined Social and Science Citation Index (search date: 4 September 2004). The 39 references were cited 293 times in 223 different articles, of which 66 were already in the data-set of 2003. The remaining 157 references were checked against the inclusion criteria. Only one study (<LINK REF="STD-Tranmer-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Tranmer 2004</LINK>) met the criteria and was added to the final set of included studies, bringing the total to 33 included studies discussed in 40 papers. We present the inclusion process schematically at <LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>.</P>
<P>The main reasons for the exclusion of studies were as follows: the study did not present results from a (randomised) controlled trial (37%); the study did not concern patients discharged from hospital (30%); the intervention under investigation was not TFU (12%); or the study did not meet the other inclusion criteria. We provide additional details in the table <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_EXCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of excluded studies</LINK>.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Stage 3: data extraction</HEADING>
<P>We developed a data extraction sheet (based on the Cochrane Consumers and Communication Review Group's data extraction template), pilot-tested it on ten randomly-selected included studies, and refined it accordingly. One review author (PM) extracted the following data from included studies and the second author (EP) checked the extracted data:<BR/>

<LI>study population (diagnosis, co-morbidities, hospital procedures, age, gender-ratio, length of stay, family support, inclusion and exclusion criteria);</LI>

<LI>conclusions (as stated by the study authors);</LI>
<LI>limitations of study and other remarks.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<BR/>Disagreements were resolved by discussion between the two review authors; if no agreement could be reached, it was planned a third author would decide.</P>
<P>We contacted five authors (<LINK REF="STD-Boter-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Boter 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gortner-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Gortner 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hartford-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Hartford 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jerant-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Jerant 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ouellet-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ouellet 2003</LINK>) for further information. All responded and one (<LINK REF="STD-Hartford-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Hartford 2002</LINK>) provided numerical data that had only been presented graphically in the published paper.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Stage 4: assessment of methodological quality</HEADING>
<P>We assessed the methodological quality of included studies using the criteria from the Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care Review Group (<LINK REF="REF-Alderson-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alderson 2002</LINK>). This list contains seven criteria to evaluate randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and controlled clinical trials (CCTs): concealment of allocation, follow-up of professionals, follow-up of patients, blinded assessment of primary outcomes, baseline measurement, reliable primary outcome measures, and protection against contamination. Further, as outlined in the Cochrane Handbook (<LINK REF="REF-Clarke-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clarke 2003</LINK>), we grouped studies into three categories: A (low risk of bias = all criteria met), B (moderate risk of bias = at least four of the criteria met) and C (high risk of bias = less than four of the criteria met).</P>
<P>Two review authors conducted the quality assessment independently. Disagreements were resolved by discussion between the two review authors; if not agreement could be reached, it was planned a third review author would decide. In some cases an editor of the Cochrane Consumers and Communication Review Group had input to clarifying the quality assessment for particular studies.</P>
<P>The EPOC quality assessment rating of each study can be found in the table <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>.</P>
<P>The quality of included studies was used to inform the discussion of the review's findings.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Stage 5: analysis</HEADING>
<P>The primary analysis was a comparison of TFU with usual care or with other types of hospital follow-up, for each of the questions outlined in the review's objectives.</P>
<P>We grouped studies in different ways: according to similarity of intervention, according to broad groups of patient populations (eg. all cardiac patients, all surgery patients) and according to the outcomes measured. The broad groupings of patient populations were based on the similarity of issues that these patients face when they are discharged from hospital. All comparisons that were attempted or made are narratively described and presented in graphs where possible. Since we expected to find significant heterogeneity in intervention modalities, research populations, outcomes and measurement tools, we only combined the study results statistically where appropriate and with inspection of the tests for homogeneity.</P>
<P>The meta-analytic technique depended on the outcomes reported. For all primary and secondary outcomes (excepting adverse events, hospital readmission and health services utilisation), it was anticipated that the majority would be measured and reported as continuous data. For continuous data (which used the same instrument) the weighted mean difference (WMD) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) are reported. Where the studies have used different instruments to measure the same conceptual outcome, the standardised mean difference (SMD) is reported. In studies that report dichotomous data (eg. with regard to readmission), the relative risk (RR) and CIs are reported. We analysed all comparisons with both a fixed-effect and a random-effects model, but only the analyses with the random-effects model are presented. We paid particular attention to the possible heterogeneity in studies and the consequences of this for interpreting the results.</P>
<P>If appropriate, we had planned to conduct subgroup analyses:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>for gender;</LI>
<LI>for age group (children/adults/old/old-old);</LI>
<LI>for living status (alone/together);</LI>
<LI>for the different healthcare professionals delivering the TFU;</LI>
<LI>for types of hospital (university, general,..);</LI>
<LI>for countries;</LI>
<LI>for TFU after one-day-stay procedures versus TFU after more than one day hospital stays;</LI>
<LI>for TFU after short hospital stays (&lt;1 week) versus TFU after longer hospital stays;</LI>
<LI>for TFU as the only form of discharge care versus TFU as part of multi-component discharge procedures;</LI>
<LI>for TFU given in the first week after discharge versus TFU given later than the first week after discharge;</LI>
<LI>for TFU in which only patients themselves were involved versus TFU in which relatives answered the telephone (due to the patient's inability);</LI>
<LI>for TFU given as a once-only intervention versus repeated TFU; and</LI>
<LI>for TFU given to different patient categories according to the medical diagnosis or health status (eg. severe, end of life, etc.).</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<BR/>We had also planned to conduct sensitivity analyses by repeating the analyses excluding studies with a 'C' methodological rating, by excluding unpublished studies, and by excluding studies with extreme outlying sample sizes. However, we could not perform the intended subgroup-analyses and sensitivity analyses as too few studies were available. Consequently, we can not report any meaningful results in relation to factors that may influence the outcomes.</P>
<P>We were not able to report on results separately for studies where the TFU was (partly) delivered to relatives/caregivers, such as in cases where the patient has severe Alzheimer's Disease, due to lack of data.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Consumer views and participation</HEADING>
<P>The protocol was submitted to three participating consumers in the Cochrane Consumers and Communication Review Group for comment, in addition to the Review Group's usual external peer review process. We sought and received additional commentary from consumers in preparing the text of the final review, through the Dutch Patients and Consumers Federation (NPCF) and the Patients' Association (UK).</P>

<P>TFU is an intervention that is often applied and researched in discharged patients. For this review, we selected studies in which TFU was the only intervention, or in which the effect of the TFU could be differentiated from other interventions. TFU is often combined with other discharge planning interventions, as shown in several of the included studies (<LINK REF="STD-Al_x002d_Asseri-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Al-Asseri 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Barnason-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Barnason 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Beckie-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Beckie 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Faulkner-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Faulkner 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Garding-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Garding 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gortner-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Gortner 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hagopian-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Hagopian 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jerant-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Jerant 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mohan-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Mohan 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Munro-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Munro 1994</LINK>).</P>
<P>The main reasons for excluding studies were: study design (not a (randomised) controlled trial), participants (not about patients discharged from an hospital to their own home or not about a telephone follow-up initiated by a hospital-based health professional), or the effects of TFU could not be calculated.

<P>
<BR/>Some studies fall into more than one category, for example, cardiac surgery patients are included in the categories of cardiac patients and surgery patients; and studies including breast cancer patients who receive surgery and/or chemotherapy fall into both the oncology and surgery categories. The large variety in patient populations also means that there is considerable clinical heterogeneity in research samples, which made it difficult to pool results across studies. However, in some patient categories there are quite large numbers of studies, as shown above.</P>
<P>Further characteristics of the patient population such as age ranges, gender, race, socio-economic status and comorbidity can be found in the table <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>, insofar as this information was provided in the trial reports. There is also considerable variety between and within studies in these population characteristics. Studies were all conducted in high-income countries (Australia, Canada, The Netherlands, Saudi Arabia, UK, USA). It is important to note that all studies included only patients who were able to speak (and moreover, able to speak the same language as the people delivering and evaluating the TFU intervention) and handle a telephone, which makes the studies' conclusions less generalisable.</P>
<P>A total of 5110 patients is analysed in the 33 studies, varying in studies between 27 (<LINK REF="STD-Emerson-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Emerson 2000</LINK>) and 842 (<LINK REF="STD-Jones-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Jones 1988</LINK>) with a mean of 154.8 patients per study (SD 162.4, median 118). Fifteen studies analysed less than 100 patients, twelve studies analysed between 101 and 200 patients, and six had more than 200 patients.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Intervention</HEADING>
<P>There is a large variety in the way the TFU was performed in the included studies. There is variety both within and across studies in: the health professionals who undertook the TFU; the aims of the interventions; the time after discharge the calls were made; the frequency of TFU calls; the format and content of the TFU; the duration of the calls; and other aspects.</P>
<P>The TFU calls were made primarily by nurses (22 studies). Other professionals involved were pharmacists (<LINK REF="STD-Al_x002d_Asseri-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Al-Asseri 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Beney-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Beney 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dudas-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Dudas 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Faulkner-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Faulkner 2000</LINK>) and physicians (<LINK REF="STD-Chande-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Chande 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Touyz-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Touyz 1998</LINK>). In three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Munro-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Munro 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ritchie-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Ritchie 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Samarel-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Samarel 2002</LINK>) different professionals were involved in performing the TFU, and in two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Gombeski-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Gombeski 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mohan-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Mohan 1999</LINK>) it was not clear which health professional delivered the intervention.</P>
<P>The aims of the TFU can roughly be grouped in two categories: 1) to improve compliance of patients with drug regimes or appointments; or 2) to ease the transition between hospital and home and to lessen experienced distress (such as anxiety, informational needs or symptom distress) of patients in the immediate postdischarge period, by enhancing their knowledge to better manage symptoms or by giving them support and reassurance. Generally, the study authors expect that achieving the aims will lead to improved patient satisfaction, better (experienced) quality of life, fewer complications and readmissions and less resource use. Almost all studies lacked a clear theoretical framework for relating the interventions to the aims and (sequence of) outcomes and endpoints.</P>
<P>The frequency and timing of the intervention delivery also varied. The frequency of calls made to patients within a three-month time period after discharge varied from a single call to a series of 32 calls (<LINK REF="STD-Samarel-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Samarel 2002</LINK>). Single calls were used in 14 studies, between 2 and 5 calls were applied in 7 studies (<LINK REF="STD-Bostrom-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Bostrom 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Garding-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Garding 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hagopian-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Hagopian 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Munro-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Munro 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Roebuck-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Roebuck 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tu-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Tu 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Weaver-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Weaver 2001</LINK>), 6 to 10 calls in 7 studies (<LINK REF="STD-Beckie-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Beckie 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gortner-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Gortner 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hartford-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Hartford 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jerant-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Jerant 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mohan-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Mohan 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Phillips-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Phillips 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tranmer-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Tranmer 2004</LINK>) and more than 10 calls in 5 studies (<LINK REF="STD-Al_x002d_Asseri-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Al-Asseri 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Faulkner-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Faulkner 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Phillips-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Phillips 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Riegel-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Riegel 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Samarel-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Samarel 2002</LINK>). In terms of frequency of calls there are differences both between and within studies. With regard to timing, the patient was first telephoned within the first week (varying between the first and the seventh day) after discharge in 28 studies. The latest time the first call to the patient was made was four weeks after discharge. There are not only differences in timing of intervention delivery between studies, but also within studies (for example, patients were called in the first week, or between the first and third day after discharge, or between week 2 and 4 after discharge).</P>
<P>Some studies used a highly structured format for the TFU, with written protocols and questions that had to be asked (for example, <LINK REF="STD-Boter-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Boter 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shesser-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Shesser 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Weaver-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Weaver 2001</LINK>), while another (<LINK REF="STD-Fallis-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Fallis 2001</LINK>) does not provide any details as to how the TFU was conducted. The other included studies lay somewhere between these extremes. All articles lacked a description of the intervention sufficiently detailed and clear as to allow replication of the intervention. The control intervention, moreover, was the subject of even less description, mostly listed unhelpfully as 'usual care'.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Outcomes</HEADING>
<P>Many different outcomes, falling into several categories, were measured in these studies. The number of outcomes varied between one and six per study, with a mean of 2.5 outcomes. In total, 82 outcomes were measured in the 33 included studies. (We present a more detailed list of studies categorised by outcomes in the Results section.)</P>
<P>Psychosocial health outcomes were measured in 20 studies. The most frequently measured outcome in this area was patient satisfaction (11), followed by anxiety (4) and depression (3). Other outcomes related to psychosocial health are: informational needs, uncertainty, mood state, coping, well-being, mental status, concerns, emotional functioning, mood disturbance, and (dimensions of) quality of life.</P>
<P>Physical health outcomes were measured in 10 studies. These included: activity level, functional limitations, independence, functional well-being, physical status, physical well-being, recovery, self care, self-care deficits, self efficacy, symptoms, pain, analgesic use, blood glucose level, lipid profiles, and tracking/diagnosing pressure ulcers. Although some of these outcomes are conceptually related, the authors gave them different names. Moreover, in general, self-developed instruments were used to measure these outcomes and no two instruments were sufficiently similar to enable comparison or pooling of the results across studies.</P>
<P>Other consumer-oriented health outcomes were measured in 14 studies. These concerned compliance (7), knowledge (4), social functioning &amp; loneliness (1), symptom distress (1) and side-effects (2). (In the protocol for this review, we used the term 'adherence'. However, since all publications use the word 'compliance', we chose to use this term in the reporting of results.)</P>
<P>Health-services-oriented outcomes were measured in 11 studies; these considered readmissions (10), Emergency Department (ED) visits (5), unnecessary return office visits, calls to hospital and costs.</P>
<P>Outcomes not only varied across studies, but even when quite similar outcomes were measured in more than one study, in most cases different instruments were used.</P>

We describe the remaining 21 studies as controlled clinical trials (CCTs), primarily because we could not be certain, from the papers, whether there definitely was prospectively random allocation to intervention and control groups. Self-developed instruments were used for most outcomes; psychometric quality was doubtful for most instruments. Power calculation had been done in 15 of the 33 studies. Keeping in mind the low average sample sizes there is a great chance that studies were underpowered, and effects that in reality exist were not detected.<I> </I>
</P>
<P>Two review authors independently assessed the methodological quality of included studies using the EPOC criteria (<LINK REF="REF-Alderson-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alderson 2002</LINK>). The mean quality score of the first author was 2.5 and for the second author was 2.6, which was not significantly different (P = 0.72). The two authors initially agreed on the methodological quality categories for 22 of the 33 included studies; the remaining 11 studies were discussed until the authors reached agreement. This resulted in 7 studies categorised as having a 'moderate risk of bias' (<LINK REF="STD-Beney-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Beney 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Garding-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Garding 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hartford-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Hartford 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jerant-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Jerant 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nelson-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Nelson 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ritchie-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Ritchie 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tranmer-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Tranmer 2004</LINK>), and the remaining 26 studies categorised as having a 'high risk of bias'. The EPOC quality criteria most often not met were: 'reliable primary outcome measures' (29/33), concealment of allocation (25/33), blinded assessment of primary outcomes' (22/33), 'baseline measurement' (15/33), protection against contamination (15/33), and follow-up of patients (9/33). </P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Results of data pooling</HEADING>
<P>We selected outcomes and patient categories for which data could be pooled quantitatively. Such pooling was only considered if similar outcomes (for example, anxiety, as a subcategory of psychosocial outcomes) were measured in at least two studies in a similar patient group (for example, patients with a cardiac condition or patients who had undergone surgery). <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK> shows the outcomes and patient categories for which this criterion was met. (Note: cells in this table are not necessarily mutually exclusive, for instance studies of patients who had undergone cardiac surgery appear in the table under the categories of cardiac patients and of surgery patients). As outlined in the Cochrane Handbook (<LINK REF="REF-Clarke-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clarke 2003</LINK>), meta-analysis should only be considered when a group of trials is sufficiently homogeneous in terms of participants, interventions and outcomes to provide a meaningful summary. In each outcome and patient category the measurement time had to be similar, and the scales used had to be either similarly continuous or similarly dichotomous. Above all, in each category we determined whether there was sufficient clinical homogeneity to warrant data pooling. We discuss these comparisons below for each combination from <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>.</P>
<P>As far as pooling was attempted, for continuous outcomes we used standardised means differences (SMDs) and a random-effects model; for dichotomous data, we used relative risks and a random-effects model. Confidence intervals were set at 95%. In all comparisons, tests were performed with regard to statistical homogeneity; this was judged (following the Cochrane Handbook (<LINK REF="REF-Clarke-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clarke 2003</LINK>)), to be acceptable, as the chi-square test value was lower than the degrees of freedom, the P value of it was above 0.1 and the inconsistency test I<SUP>2</SUP> was lower than 50%. Finally, due to the earlier described heterogeneity in patient populations, research tools, and intervention modes, and due to the predominately low methodological quality of the studies, we stress that all reported meta-analyses have to be considered with caution.</P>

<I>A) Effect of TFU on anxiety in cardiac surgery patients at approximately one month after discharge compared to usual care</I>

Two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Beckie-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Beckie 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Roebuck-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Roebuck 1999</LINK>) were rated as having a high risk of bias and one (<LINK REF="STD-Hartford-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Hartford 2002</LINK>) as having a moderate risk of bias. All three studies involved people undergoing cardiac surgery. Anxiety was measured at a reasonably similar point in time (four and eight weeks (<LINK REF="STD-Hartford-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Hartford 2002</LINK>) (data from the measurement at four weeks was used for the meta-analysis), five weeks (<LINK REF="STD-Roebuck-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Roebuck 1999</LINK>), and six weeks (<LINK REF="STD-Beckie-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Beckie 1989</LINK>)). Three different measurement tools were used, all measuring continuous outcomes. Pooling showed a standardised mean difference of -0.47 (95% CI -1.28 to 0.34), which means both approaches are clinically equivalent (see Comparison 01, Outcome 01). However, caution is needed since tests demonstrated large statistical heterogeneity.</P>

</I>Six studies measured satisfaction in surgery patients: <LINK REF="STD-Al_x002d_Asseri-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Al-Asseri 2001</LINK> (cardiac surgery), <LINK REF="STD-Barnason-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Barnason 1995</LINK> (cardiac surgery), <LINK REF="STD-Fallis-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Fallis 2001</LINK> (laparoscopic cholecystectomy), <LINK REF="STD-Gombeski-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Gombeski 1993</LINK> (general surgery and otolaryngoly), <LINK REF="STD-Tranmer-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Tranmer 2004</LINK> (cardiac surgery), and <LINK REF="STD-Weaver-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Weaver 2001</LINK> (cardiac surgery). <LINK REF="STD-Fallis-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Fallis 2001</LINK> measured satisfaction at two days post discharge, <LINK REF="STD-Barnason-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Barnason 1995</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Tranmer-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Tranmer 2004</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Weaver-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Weaver 2001</LINK> measured this outcome at approximately one month, <LINK REF="STD-Gombeski-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Gombeski 1993</LINK> at six weeks and <LINK REF="STD-Al_x002d_Asseri-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Al-Asseri 2001</LINK> at two months. Therefore statistical pooling was not possible due to heterogeneity in measurement times. Five studies found no differences in satisfaction and only <LINK REF="STD-Fallis-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Fallis 2001</LINK> concludes that the TFU group is statistically more satisfied. This study used a chi-square test for a continuous outcome, however, and the author states that the results should be viewed with caution because of small cell sizes.<BR/>In conclusion, with regard to satisfaction in surgery patients, statistical pooling was not possible, and no single study identified favourable effects for the TFU group compared with the control groups.</P>
<P>
<I>D) Effect of TFU on depression in cardiac surgery patients</I>
<BR/>The next potential comparison concerns depression in cardiac surgery patients. Two studies measured this outcomes in cardiac surgery patients (<LINK REF="STD-Roebuck-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Roebuck 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Weaver-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Weaver 2001</LINK>). In one study the outcome was measured at one month and in the other at five weeks post discharge. These studies used two different instruments, both with a continuous scale. However, <LINK REF="STD-Weaver-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Weaver 2001</LINK> only presents a dichotomised result, which makes pooling impossible. Both studies found no statistically significant differences between intervention and control groups with regard to depression in cardiac surgery patients.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Al_x002d_Asseri-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Al-Asseri 2001</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Faulkner-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Faulkner 2000</LINK> studied compliance with pill-taking in cardiac surgery patients. <LINK REF="STD-Al_x002d_Asseri-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Al-Asseri 2001</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Faulkner-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Faulkner 2000</LINK> were both rated as having a high risk of bias. <LINK REF="STD-Al_x002d_Asseri-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Al-Asseri 2001</LINK> measured this outcome at 8 weeks, and <LINK REF="STD-Faulkner-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Faulkner 2000</LINK> at 6 and 12 weeks after discharge. Both used dichotomous scales. For the meta-analysis, data of 6 and 8 weeks are combined; the combined effect is statistically not significant (RR 1.68, 95% CI 0.59 to 4.78) (see Comparison 02, Outcome 02). However, caution has to be taken in the interpretation of this pooling because tests demonstrated large statistical heterogeneity.</P>
<P>
<I>F) Effect of TFU on compliance (making and keeping an appointment) in ED patients compared to usual care</I>
<BR/>Four studies measured compliance in ED patients (<LINK REF="STD-Chande-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Chande 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jones-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Jones 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nelson-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Nelson 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ritchie-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Ritchie 2000</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Nelson-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Nelson 1991</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Ritchie-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Ritchie 2000</LINK> are studies with a moderate risk of bias; the others have a high risk of bias. <LINK REF="STD-Chande-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Chande 1994</LINK> measured compliance by asking if patients had called their primary care physician and if they had filled their prescriptions. <LINK REF="STD-Jones-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Jones 1988</LINK> measured compliance with scheduling and keeping an appointment. <LINK REF="STD-Nelson-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Nelson 1991</LINK> measued compliance by the appropriate use of follow-up care, including keeping appointments, following instructions, using the primary care centre rather than the ED for non-urgent care, and using the telephone prior to or instead of coming to the hospital for an unscheduled visit. <LINK REF="STD-Ritchie-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Ritchie 2000</LINK> measured compliance in making and attending appointments. The two common points in these four studies, suitable for data pooling, are making an appointment/calling the doctor (<LINK REF="STD-Chande-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Chande 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jones-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Jones 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ritchie-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Ritchie 2000</LINK>) and keeping an appointment (<LINK REF="STD-Jones-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Jones 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nelson-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Nelson 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ritchie-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Ritchie 2000</LINK>). All four studies measured these outcomes retrospectively at different points in time, but this does not hinder comparison since they all measured making/keeping appointments that were considered to be necessary. All four studies had usual care as control condition. <LINK REF="STD-Jones-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Jones 1988</LINK> used two additional control groups (but only the usual care control groups are taken in consideration for this comparison). The meta-analyses show effect estimates in support of the TFU intervention group, both for making an appointment (RR 1.70, 95% CI 0.92 to 3.14) (see Comparison 02, Outcome 02) and for keeping an appointment (RR 1.58, 95%CI 1.01 to 2.48) (see Comparison 02, Outcome 03). However, confidence intervals for both poolings are large and tests show considerable statistical heterogeneity.</P>
<P>
<I>G) Effect of TFU on compliance in paediatric patients</I>
<BR/>Compliance in paediatric patients was studied by <LINK REF="STD-Chande-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Chande 1994</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Mohan-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Mohan 1999</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Nelson-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Nelson 1991</LINK>; two of these studies concern paediatric patients attending the ED and the other concerned infants requiring apnea monitoring. These samples are considered too clinically heterogeneous and were not pooled; moreover the studies of paediatric patients in the ED (<LINK REF="STD-Chande-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Chande 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nelson-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Nelson 1991</LINK>) are already included in comparison F) above.</P>
<P>
<I>H) Effect of TFU on knowledge in cardiac patients compared to control condition</I>
</P>
<P>Three studies measured knowledge in cardiac patients (<LINK REF="STD-Barnason-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Barnason 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Beckie-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Beckie 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Garding-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Garding 1988</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Garding-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Garding 1988</LINK> was rated as having a moderate risk of bias; the others as having a high risk of bias. <LINK REF="STD-Barnason-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Barnason 1995</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Beckie-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Beckie 1989</LINK> involve cardiac surgery patients and <LINK REF="STD-Garding-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Garding 1988</LINK> cardiac patients who have been hospitalised for an acute myocardial infarction. All three studies used self-developed instruments of which two (<LINK REF="STD-Beckie-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Beckie 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Garding-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Garding 1988</LINK>) were based on an earlier instrument of Horn and Swain. <LINK REF="STD-Beckie-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Beckie 1989</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Garding-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Garding 1988</LINK> had usual care as comparison, while <LINK REF="STD-Barnason-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Barnason 1995</LINK> used two control groups (one received in-hospital teaching only, the other in-hospital teaching plus post discharge group teaching; for this meta-analysis we used data from the in-hospital teaching only control group). It is not exactly clear when the outcomes were measured, but all had to be at around four to eight weeks post discharge. The meta-analysis did not reveal a statistically favourable effect for the TFU (SMD 1.44, 95%CI -0.25 to 3.13) (see Comparison 03, Outcome 01), but here also tests show considerable statistical heterogeneity.</P>

<P>In this section, pooling was possible for readmission data in three patient categories, and for ED visits in surgery patients.</P>
<P>
<I>I) Effect of TFU on readmissions in cardiac patients compared to usual care</I>
<BR/>Readmissions in cardiac patients were studied by <LINK REF="STD-Beckie-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Beckie 1989</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Riegel-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Riegel 2002</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Tranmer-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Tranmer 2004</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Weaver-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Weaver 2001</LINK>. <LINK REF="STD-Tranmer-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Tranmer 2004</LINK> was rated as having a moderate risk of bias; the others were rated as having a high risk of bias. <LINK REF="STD-Riegel-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Riegel 2002</LINK> involved medical patients with heart failure, and the other studies involved cardiac surgery patients. Three measured readmissions by status analysis of hospital records, and one (<LINK REF="STD-Tranmer-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Tranmer 2004</LINK>) by patient self-report. One retrospected the first month, the second the first five weeks, the third the first six weeks and the fourth one the first three months, so possible variations between studies can be attributed to the time period, but the effects do not hamper comparisons between intervention and control. Since <LINK REF="STD-Weaver-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Weaver 2001</LINK> does not differentiate between ED visits and readmissions, this is excluded from the analysis. The pooled effect is not statistically significant (RR 0.75, 95%CI 0.41 to 1.36) (see Comparison 04, Outcome 01). Tests for statistical homogeneity are within an acceptable range.</P>
<P>
<I>J) Effect of TFU on readmissions in surgery patients compared to control condition</I>
<BR/>Readmissions in surgery patients were studied by <LINK REF="STD-Beckie-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Beckie 1989</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Fallis-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Fallis 2001</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Ouellet-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ouellet 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Tranmer-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Tranmer 2004</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Weaver-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Weaver 2001</LINK>. Only <LINK REF="STD-Tranmer-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Tranmer 2004</LINK> was rated as having a moderate risk of bias; the others are at high risk of bias. Both <LINK REF="STD-Beckie-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Beckie 1989</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Tranmer-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Tranmer 2004</LINK> were also included in comparison I, above. Four studies had usual care as comparison group; <LINK REF="STD-Fallis-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Fallis 2001</LINK> compared the TFU group to a home visit by a nurse. Three studies measured the outcome at four weeks post discharge, one at five weeks and one at six weeks. <LINK REF="STD-Ouellet-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ouellet 2003</LINK> is problematic in that the author only states that there were four readmissions in the total group and that there were no significant differences, but does not present exact data for both groups; for the meta-analysis we used two readmissions in the treatment group and two in the control group for this study. Again, as <LINK REF="STD-Weaver-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Weaver 2001</LINK> does not differentiate between ED visits and readmissions this study's data is excluded from this comparison. The pooled effect is not significant (RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.28 to 1.55) (see Comparison 04, Outcome 02) and tests for statistical homogeneity are within an acceptable range.</P>

<P>
<I>L) Effect of TFU on ED visits in surgery patients compared to control condition</I>
<BR/>The final potential meta-analysis for this review concerns surgery patients' visits to the ED ,which has been studied by <LINK REF="STD-Fallis-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Fallis 2001</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Ouellet-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ouellet 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Tranmer-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Tranmer 2004</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Weaver-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Weaver 2001</LINK>.

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>This review included 33 studies measuring the effects of telephone follow-up (TFU) in 5110 patients. The poor methodological quality of the included studies is a major limitation of this review. No included study had a low risk of bias, Seven had a moderate risk of bias and 26 had a high risk of bias. Moreover this review deals with a high degree of clinical diversity and statistical heterogeneity in several elements, and most studies have small sample sizes. Together, this means that drawing conclusions is very difficult, and any conclusions cannot be stated firmly. </P>
<P>In terms of our primary outcomes, we can draw no firm conclusions. Many different outcomes have been measured in the included studies, but only a few outcomes are measured more than one study. Moreover, many outcomes in this field are poorly defined. They are based on different and poorly described conceptual foundations. Many terms are used for the same phenomenon. There are many overlapping terms. Measurement instruments vary and are often unvalidated. </P>
<P>The fact that few outcomes were measured across more than one study made only limited pooling possible. As far as meta-analysis was possible, most comparisons suffered from considerable statistical heterogeneity and all pointed towards clinical equivalence. </P>
<P>There might be effects of the intervention which could not be shown. This may be due to poor methodological quality, (too) small sample sizes and/or insensitive instruments. We must question whether there was sufficient contrast in the studies: many studies compare TFU with usual care but do not describe what the usual care consisted of. Also, it is important to consider the extent to which patients may have received discharge preparation in hospital. It is possible that lack of contrast masks the effect of a TFU intervention.</P>
<P>The large heterogeneity in the interventions might also partly explain the lack of effects. Variety was evident in the people who delivered the TFU intervention, as well as in the frequency, duration, starting time, structure, and aims, and in other aspects. The extent to which the intervention is comparable across and within the studies is questionable.<I> </I>It seems that there is no agreement about the critical elements of an effective TFU intervention. The heterogeneity can also partly be explained by the different aims of the TFU intervention: enhancing compliance with referrals might require one form of TFU, and reducing anxiety and uncertainty, or improving a patient's knowledge of their symptoms, another form. Moreover, many studies combined several of these aims. Narrowing the inclusion criteria for this review would have improved the homogeneity of the included studies, but would have resulted not only in a very small number of included studies being identified, but also in 'laboratory' studies which do not reflect real world circumstances. </P>
<P>TFU can be regarded as a 'socially complex intervention', a term used by Lindsay (<LINK REF="REF-Lindsay-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lindsay 2004</LINK>) to denote interventions that are characterised by actions that are difficult to define, and by varied, and difficult to control, contextual factors. Both TFU and the comparison interventions are dependent on individual professionals, individual patients, social interactions and social settings, which makes it hard to define, to standardise and to adequately describe what is being done. Many factors, therefore, may mask the effects.</P>
<P>Another point of discussion is given by the study of <LINK REF="STD-Faulkner-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Faulkner 2000</LINK>. The author found no significant differences in compliance in the short term (3 months) but did find differences after that period up to two years later. We should consider whether three months is too early to see the effects of TFU - but is two years realistic?</P>
<P>It should also be noted, however, that none of the included studies show effects in favour of the control group. Moreover, some of the studies report that patients value the TFU calls, although it seems remarkable that this is not reflected in the measured empirical outcomes. We must question, therefore, whether the scales are the right ones to measure the effects, and whether the measurement tools are sensitive enough. Also, we note that some individual studies found effects in favour of the TFU group. The Dutch Patients and Consumers Federation commented (during the preparation of this review) that patients' appreciation of the call indicates that TFU deserves a place in aftercare. To stop TFU based on the lack of firm conclusions in this review, may be to throw the baby out with the bath water. However, we strongly emphasise that questions remain about: the ideal person to deliver the intervention; the best time to start TFU; the number of follow-up calls needed and the ideal period of time for their delivery; the ideal structure and content of TFU, a possible need for variations in TFU for different patient categories; differences across countries and health systems, the nature and timing of effects to be expected of TFU, and many other issues. We need large scale, high quality studies with more comparable (and better reported) interventions and with sufficiently sensitive validated tools, in order to answer these questions.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>Some individual studies included in this review identify some effects in favour of telephone follow-up (TFU), and no study reported adverse effects of the intervention. Nevertheless we cannot conclude that TFU is an effective intervention. Nor is there conclusive evidence to exclude TFU from discharge planning activities. </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Research in this field should focus on the many questions as stated in the discussion. Clear and detailed descriptions of the strategies in both the intervention and control arms are needed. We note also the poor methodological quality of the included studies. For instance the criterion of reliable outcome measurement was frequently not met because outcomes were not assessed by two people, and consequently interrater agreement could not be reported; this is something that easily can be resolved. The same applies for the criteria blinded assessment of outcomes and concealment of allocation, which can quite easily be met by increased rigor in research protocols. There remain many challenges ahead, for instance to develop adequately sensitive instruments for the outcomes that can be addressed by TFU. Improved theoretical exploration of the relationship between interventions and outcomes is needed: what and when effects may be expected of TFU, and what instruments are suitable and sensitive enough to measure them? There is a need for large scale, well-designed studies with uniform and well-described interventions and outcomes.</P>

<P>AIM OF INTERVENTION: to reduce resource use (readmissions, hospital days, costs).</P>
<P>AIM OF STUDY: to assess the effectiveness of a standardized telephonic case-management intervention in decreasing resource use in patients with chronic heart failure.</P>
<P>STUDY DESIGN: CCT.</P>
<P>METHODS OF RECRUITMENT OF PARTICIPANTS: physicians known to admit patients with heart failure were matched by specialty (cardiology, internal medicine), practice size and number of HF admissions in the prior year. After matching, physicians were randomized to the intervention or usual care group. Although it was the physicians who were randomized, patients were the unit of analysis for this study. It was not feasible to randomize patients in the same physician practice to different groups because of the possibility that the physicians would modify care in the control group to mimic aspects of the intervention. Physicians were not informed of the group to which they were assigned. A total of 281 physicians were randomized.</P>
<P>INCLUSION CRITERIA FOR PARTICIPATION IN STUDY: confirmed diagnosis of heart failure as the primary reason for their hospital visit/ speak English or Spanish.</P>

<P>DETAILS OF INTERVENTION: The intervention group received, in addition to the usual care, active and ongoing follow-up via nurse-initiated telephone calls from the APN in cardiac surgery at 3 and 5 days following discharge and then weekly for 4 more weeks. During the calls, the APN continued with the plan of care established in the hospital, provided ongoing information and assessment, assisted with self-management of common symptoms and facilitated referrals to appropriate healthcare resources. Telephone sessions were individually tailored in response to patient's symptoms, concerns and recovery. All sessions, however, were standardized sufficiently to include evaluation of physical and psychological states and incorporated mutual goal setting for the management of symptoms in the recovery period. The initial TFU were approximately 20 to 30 minutes.</P>
<P>DETAILS OF CONTROL: usual care: this included preoperative and discharge preparation by the APN, provision of an education booklet and home care follow-up if necessary. Patients were provided the contact information for the APN and instruction to call with questions or concerns.</P>
