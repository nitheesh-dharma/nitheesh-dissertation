<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2016-04-28 19:05:13 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="Helen E Nagels">
<P>
<B>Review question </B>
</P>
<P>This updated Cochrane review evaluated the efficacy and safety of GnRH antagonists compared to the more widely-used GnRH agonists (long-course protocol).</P>
<P>
<B>Background: </B>
</P>
<P>Gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist is commonly used to prevent cycle cancellation secondary to a premature luteinizing hormone (LH) surge, and thereby increase the chance of live birth in women undergoing assisted reproductive technology (ART), while reducing the risk of complications such as ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS). Gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonists are now being seriously considered as a potential means of achieving better treatment outcomes because the protocol is more flexible and antagonists may reduce OHSS more effectively than agonists. However, there is the need to evaluate the benefits as well as the safety of these GnRH antagonist regimens in comparison with the existing GnRH agonist regimens.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>We found 73 randomised controlled trials comparing GnRH antagonist with GnRH agonist in a total of 12,212 women undergoing ART. The evidence is current to May 2015</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>There was no evidence of a difference between the groups in live birth rates (i.e. rates at conclusion of a course of treatment). The evidence suggested that if the chance of live birth following GnRH agonist is assumed to be 29%, the chance following GnRH antagonist would be between 25% and 33%. However, the OHSS rates were much higher after GnRH agonist. The evidence suggested that if the risk of OHSS following GnRH agonist is assumed to be 11%, the risk following GnRH antagonist would be between 6% and 9%.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
</P>
<P>The evidence was of moderate quality for both live birth and OHSS. The main limitations of the evidence were the possibility of publication bias for live birth (with small studies likely to report favourable outcomes for GnRH antagonist) and poor reporting of study methods for OHSS.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2016-04-27 06:06:00 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonists can be used to prevent a luteinizing hormone (LH) surge during controlled ovarian hyperstimulation (COH) without the hypo-oestrogenic side-effects, flare-up, or long down-regulation period associated with agonists. The antagonists directly and rapidly inhibit gonadotrophin release within several hours through competitive binding to pituitary GnRH receptors. This property allows their use at any time during the follicular phase. Several different regimens have been described including multiple-dose fixed (0.25 mg daily from day six to seven of stimulation), multiple-dose flexible (0.25 mg daily when leading follicle is 14 to 15 mm), and single-dose (single administration of 3 mg on day 7 to 8 of stimulation) protocols, with or without the addition of an oral contraceptive pill. Further, women receiving antagonists have been shown to have a lower incidence of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS). Assuming comparable clinical outcomes for the antagonist and agonist protocols, these benefits would justify a change from the standard long agonist protocol to antagonist regimens. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2001, and previously updated in 2006 and 2011.</P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2016-05-09 14:37:56 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="Helen E Nagels">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2016-04-28 10:28:38 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="Helen E Nagels">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2016-04-28 10:28:30 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="Helen E Nagels">
<P>Controlled ovarian hyperstimulation (COH) coupled with in vitro fertilisation (IVF) or intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) was one of the major advances in the treatment of subfertility in the second half of the 20th century. One aspect of COH-IVF or ICSI that requires attention is the occurrence of a luteinizing hormone (LH) surge which may occur prematurely, before the leading follicle reaches the optimum diameter for triggering ovulation. Such premature LH surges prevent effective induction of multiple follicular maturation patterns for a significant number of women.</P>
<P>Gonadotrophin-releasing hormone agonists (GnRH agonists) have played an important role in reducing the incidence of premature LH surges by reversibly blocking pituitary gonadotrophin secretion. As a result, the rates of cancellation of assisted conception cycles are decreased and pregnancy rates increased (<LINK REF="REF-Albano-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Albano 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hughes-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hughes 1992</LINK>). However, the use of GnRH agonists is not without disadvantages. Even though the standard long-course GnRH agonist protocol proved to be the most efficacious protocol (<LINK REF="REF-Daya-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Daya 2000</LINK>) for the use of GnRH agonists, it requires two to three weeks for desensitisation, with relatively high costs due to an increased requirement for gonadotrophin injections, and the need for hormonal and ultrasonographic measurements (<LINK REF="REF-Olivennes-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Olivennes 1994</LINK>).</P>
<P>A common complication associated with ovarian stimulation with exogenous gonadotrophins is ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) (<LINK REF="REF-Mathur-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mathur 2007</LINK>). It usually occurs following a LH surge or after exposure to human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) (<LINK REF="REF-Mozes-1965" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mozes 1965</LINK>). Most cases of OHSS are mild with few or no clinical consequences. However, severe cases occur occasionally with serious morbidity and mortalities (<LINK REF="REF-Delvigne-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Delvigne 2002</LINK>). Gonadotrophin-releasing hormone analogues (GnRH agonists and antagonists) stabilise the luteal phase thereby preventing premature LH surges and reducing the risk of OHSS.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2016-04-27 06:00:59 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In 1999, gonadotrophin-releasing hormone antagonists (GnRH antagonist) were introduced to the market to prevent LH surge, and it was assumed that GnRH antagonists might be a more patient-friendly protocol than the mid-luteal GnRH agonist protocol. GnRH antagonists cause immediate, reversible and dose-related inhibition of gonadotrophin release by competitive blockade of the GnRH receptors in the pituitary gland, and therefore treatment can be restricted to those days when a premature LH surge is likely to occur (<LINK REF="REF-Duijkers-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Duijkers 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Felberbaum-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Felberbaum 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Huirne-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Huirne 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>The first generation of GnRH antagonists were associated with allergic side-effects due to an induced histamine release, which hampered the clinical development of these compounds. Third generation GnRH antagonists such as ganirelix (NV Organon, Oss, the Netherlands) and cetrorelix (ASTA-Medica, Frankfurt am Main, Germany) have resolved these issues and are approved for clinical use (<LINK REF="REF-Olivennes-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Olivennes 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>Two approaches have emerged in GnRH antagonist administration; the single-dose protocol, in which one injection of GnRH antagonist (Cetrotide® 3 mg, Merck SeronoSA., Geneva, Switzerland ) is administered in the late phase of ovarian stimulation and the multiple-dose regimen, in which 0.25 µg of cetrorelix or ganirelix is administered daily from stimulation day 6 onwards (fixed regimen). A flexible regimen based on the follicular size, has since been introduced to minimise the number and duration of GnRH antagonist injections (<LINK REF="REF-Huirne-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Huirne 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>In a natural ovulatory cycle, ovulation, the release of the dominant follicle from the ovary, usually occurs about 36 hours after LH surge. In women undergoing controlled ovarian stimulation (COS) during assisted reproductive technology (ART), certain agents are usually administered to mimic the natural LH surge. Ultrasound scan and blood oestrogen levels are used to determine the day on which to administer the triggering agents. Ovulation triggering agents include hCG and GnRH agonist. These agents have different modes of action and their use might, therefore, differentially influence the effectiveness of GnRH antagonists.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2016-04-28 10:28:38 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="Helen E Nagels">
<P>Applying GnRH antagonists for pituitary desensitisation during COH is expected to result in a dramatic reduction in the duration of GnRH analogue treatment and to reduce the amount of gonadotrophin needed for stimulation as compared with the long agonist protocol. Other potential benefits include a lower risk of developing severe ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) and avoidance of oestrogen deprivation symptoms (for example hot flushes, sleep disturbances, headaches) frequently observed in the pre-stimulation phase of a long agonist protocol. Whether the previously mentioned benefits justify a change in routine treatment from the standard long-course GnRH agonist protocol to the GnRH antagonist regimen depends on whether the clinical outcomes using these protocols are similar.<BR/>

Where studies had multiple publications the review authors collated multiple reports of the same study, so that each study rather than each report was the unit of interest in the review, and such studies would have a single study ID with multiple references. We contacted trial authors to request additional information or data. We also received a response from the sponsoring pharmaceutical companies.</P>

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2016-04-21 22:24:42 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Three authors (RA, JB and WSL) independently assessed the risk of bias of the included trials using The Cochrane 'Risk of bias' (RoB) tool (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011b</LINK>). The domains assessed were: (1) sequence generation (for example; was the method used for allocation sequence adequately described?); (2) allocation concealment (for example, was allocation adequately concealed?); (3) blinding of participants, personnel and outcome assessors (for example; was knowledge of the allocated intervention adequately prevented during the study?); (4) incomplete outcome data (for example, were incomplete outcome data adequately addressed?); (5) selective outcome reporting (for example, were reports of the study free of suggestion of selective outcome reporting?); and (6) other sources of bias (for example, was the study apparently free of other problems that could put it at a high risk of bias?). Other potential sources of bias included baseline imbalances, source of funding, early stopping for benefit, and appropriateness of cross-over design. We resolved disagreements by discussion or by consulting a fourth review author. We described all judgements fully and presented the conclusions in the 'Risk of bias' table (see the <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK> table), which was incorporated into the interpretation of review findings by means of sensitivity analyses (see below).</P>
<P>With respect to selective reporting, we sought published protocols and compared the outcomes between the protocol and the final published study, but the searches did not yield published protocols of any of the included studies. We took care to search for within-trial selective reporting, such as non-reporting of obvious outcomes, or reporting them in insufficient detail to allow for inclusion. Where identified studies failed to report the primary outcomes of live birth and OHSS but did report interim outcomes such as pregnancy, we undertook informal assessment as to whether the interim values (e.g. pregnancy rates) were similar to those reported in studies that also reported live birth.</P>

<EFFECT_MEASURES MODIFIED="2016-04-21 22:29:09 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We only reported dichotomous data (e.g. live birth rates) in this review and we used the numbers of events in the control and intervention groups of each study to calculate Mantel-Haenszel odds ratios (ORs). We reversed the direction of effect of individual studies, if required, to ensure consistency across trials. We presented 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for all outcomes. Where data to calculate ORs were not available, we utilised the most detailed numerical data available that facilitated similar analyses of included studies (e.g. test statistics, P values). We compared the magnitude and direction of effect reported by studies with how they were presented in the review, taking account of legitimate differences (<LINK REF="REF-Deeks-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deeks 2011</LINK>).</P>

<LI>Women randomised to treatment with GnRH antagonist started ovarian stimulation on day two to three of the menstrual cycle. The GnRH antagonist was started on stimulation day six, by daily subcutaneous administration up to and including the day of human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) administration in the fixed protocol or depending on the dominant follicle size in the flexible protocol.The GnRH long agonist reference treatment was started in the mid-luteal phase (cycle day 21 to 24) by either daily intranasal or subcutaneous administration.</LI>
<LI>Ovarian stimulation was started after two weeks if pituitary down-regulation was established (serum estradiol level &lt; 50 pg/ml). In both treatment groups, ovarian stimulation was started with a fixed daily dose of 150 IU or 225 IU recombinant follicle stimulating hormone (rFSH) or human menopausal gonadotrophin (hMG) for the first five stimulation days. Thereafter, the dose of FSH was adapted depending on the ovarian response, as monitored via ultrasonography (US). Triggering of ovulation was induced with hCG (10,000 IU) if at least three follicles that were more than 17 mm in diameter were observed by US.</LI>
<LI>Trigger used: the majority of the included studies used hCG trigger or did not state which trigger was used; one of the included studies used a combination of both hCG and GnRH agonist as trigger agents (<LINK REF="STD-Engmann-2008a" TYPE="STUDY">Engmann 2008a</LINK>).</LI>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2016-04-28 23:15:51 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="Helen E Nagels">
<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-04-28 23:15:51 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="Helen E Nagels">
<P>The previous version of this systematic review included 45 studies, while this updated version includes 73 RCTs and 12,212 randomised women. To our knowledge this systematic review and meta-analysis represents the most recent and largest amount of evidence comparing the use of GnRH antagonist with long-course GnRH agonist protocols in IVF or ICSI treatment cycles.</P>
<P>In this updated version of the review we focused on the effectiveness and safety of GnRH antagonist compared to GnRH agonist cycles in ART. Regarding effectiveness, there was no  evidence of differences in live birth rate and ongoing pregnancy rate between GnRH agonist and GnRH antagonist LH peak suppression protocols.</P>
<P>With regard to safety, GnRH antagonists substantially reduced the incidence of OHSS. For the overall population from assembled studies, the evidence suggested that, if the risk of OHSS following GnRH agonist is assumed to be 11%, the risk following GnRH antagonist would be between 6% and 9%. In addition, there was evidence of a lower rate of moderate or severe OHSS in women who received the GnRH antagonist protocol compared with those who were treated with the GnRH agonist long protocol. However there was no evidence of a difference in miscarriage rates per woman randomised between the two treatment protocols. There was no clear picture with respect to cycle cancellation between the two treatment groups. While fewer cycles were cancelled in the GnRH antagonist group due to high risk of OHSS, there is some degree of uncertainty with cancellation due to poor ovarian response, as this outcome was sensitive to the choice of statistical model. In summary, there is moderate quality evidence that the use of GnRH antagonist compared with long-course GnRH agonist protocols is associated with a substantial reduction in OHSS without reducing the likelihood of achieving live birth or ongoing pregnancy.</P>
<P>Previous versions of this systematic review showed substantially lower clinical and ongoing pregnancy rates for the GnRH antagonist protocol. Two earlier meta-analyses of studies, comparing fixed and flexible GnRH antagonist protocols directly, demonstrated a trend towards higher pregnancy rates when using the fixed protocol, possibly explained by better LH control (<LINK REF="REF-Al_x002d_Inany-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Al-Inany 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kolibianakis-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kolibianakis 2006</LINK>). The improved performance of antagonist cycles in the present update cannot be explained by the relative use of fixed protocols however, as relatively few new fixed protocols were included.</P>
<P>Several studies have suggested that LH instability decreases the probability of pregnancy in antagonist cycles (<LINK REF="REF-Bosch-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bosch 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kolibianakis-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kolibianakis 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Seow-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Seow 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shoham-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shoham 2002</LINK>). LH instability is defined as any fluctuation in LH level, either a LH surge or rise in LH concentration, in the course of ovarian hyperstimulation. A decrease in the relative incidence of LH instability in the current review can possibly have improved pregnancy outcomes in antagonist cycles, although the mechanism for such change is still unclear. Further studies are needed to investigate the possible role of LH-instability in the improvement of pregnancy outcomes of GnRH antagonist cycles.</P>
<P>Increased favourable pregnancy outcomes with GnRH antagonist treatment may also be the result of an improved learning curve with the relatively new GnRH antagonist over the last 15 years. Extensive experience with GnRH antagonist protocols in large studies, leading to more favourable study outcomes, may have positively influenced pregnancy outcomes of GnRH antagonist cycles. Finally, changes in the use of OCP pretreatment (<LINK REF="REF-Griesinger-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Griesinger 2008</LINK>), scheduling of hCG for final oocyte maturation (<LINK REF="REF-Kolibianakis-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kolibianakis 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tremellen-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tremellen 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Orvieto-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Orvieto 2008</LINK>) or patient selection (<LINK REF="STD-Sbracia-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Sbracia 2009</LINK>) may all have contributed to the optimisation of the use of antagonist cycles in ART. However, the improvement in pregnancy outcomes could also be due to the effects of potential bias in the included studies. For example, the forest plot (<LINK REF="FIG-05" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 5</LINK>) suggests a tendency for publication of studies with more favourable outcomes with the possibility of existence of unpublished studies with less favourable outcomes.</P>
<P>Previous work on the role of OCP pretreatment in direct comparison studies has indicated that OCP pretreatment leads to a longer duration of stimulation, higher oocyte yield, but reduced ongoing pregnancy rate (<A HREF="http://archie.cochrane.org/sections/documents/view?version=48477926069055880290110606143734&amp;format=REVMAN#REF-Smulders-2010#REF-Smulders-2010">Smulders 2010</A>). Also a trend towards lower pregnancy rates when using OCP pretreatment has been observed in a separate meta-analysis (<A HREF="http://archie.cochrane.org/sections/documents/view?version=48477926069055880290110606143734&amp;format=REVMAN#REF-Griesinger-2008#REF-Griesinger-2008">Griesinger 2008</A>). As such, it has been recommended that OCP pretreatment does not seem to be the regimen of choice for GnRH antagonist cycles. In the previous versions of this review, however, a subgroup analysis of studies that used OCP pretreatment revealed no substantial difference between the agonist and antagonist groups for ongoing or clinical pregnancy rates. The percentage of women receiving OCP pretreatment in the 2011 update was comparable with the preceding version in 2006.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2016-04-28 23:13:59 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="Helen E Nagels">
<P>Overall, the data demonstrate that GnRH antagonist is useful in women undergoing IVF or ICSI because it substantially reduces the occurrence of OHSS without reducing the chances of achieving live a live birth.</P>
<P>A long-course GnRH agonist protocol with maximum ovarian stimulation has been the standard protocol for many decades. However, it is relatively complex and expensive, requires long treatment cycles and intensive monitoring, and leads to an abnormal hormonal environment in women. There is now an eager desire to shift to more patient-friendly, mild ovarian-stimulation regimens in which GnRH antagonist may be a suitable solution because there is evidence to suggest that its use is associated with comparable pregnancy outcomes.</P>
<P>A good number of the included studies did not report live birth and OHSS: 12 of the included studies reported data on live birth while only 36 reported data on OHSS. One study used single embryo transfer in the antagonist arm and double embryo transfer in the agonist arm. Some of the outcomes of interest were reported by some of the included studies in such a way that they could not be included in meta-analyses. For example, some of the denominators were reported as 'per oocyte' or 'per embryo' transferred, where the numbers of oocytes or embryos transferred were not equal to the number of women randomised. In some of the included studies, some outcomes were not properly defined making it difficult to categorise such outcomes, for example, 'pregnancy rate' which could either be 'ongoing' or 'clinical' pregnancy. We included a small number of studies because they met the inclusion criteria, although they did not report data on any of the outcomes of interest. With respect to the triggering agent used for oocyte maturation, the majority of the studies either used hCG or did not report the triggering agent used. Thus no comparison could be made between the triggering agents such as hCG versus GnRH agonist.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2016-04-22 21:10:53 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The evidence was of moderate quality using GRADE ratings for live birth, OHSS, ongoing pregnancy, clinical pregnancy, miscarriage and cycle cancellation due to poor ovarian response. The main limitations in the evidence were poor reporting of study methods. For example, a majority of the included studies either did not report the processes involved in random sequence generation and allocation concealment or reported vague and insufficient information on the processes, thereby making it difficult to make conclusive judgements on these domains of risk of bias. Poor reporting also affected the assessment of other domains of risk of bias with most of them being rated as 'unclear'. For live birth, there was evidence suggestive of the possibility of reporting (publication) bias with small studies more likely to report favourable outcomes for GnRH antagonist.</P>

<LI>A systematic review and meta-analysis, <LINK REF="REF-Youssef-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Youssef 2012</LINK>, compared the effectiveness and safety of various protocols including GnRH antagonist versus long-course GnRH agonist protocol. There was no evidence of a difference between women who received GnRH antagonist and those who were treated with long-course GnRH agonist protocol in three RCTs, either in clinical pregnancy rate (OR 0.72, 95% CI 0.49 to 1.05, five RCTs) or cycle cancellation rate (OR 1.25, 95% CI 0.76 to 2.05).</LI>
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>There is a systematic review and meta-analysis that included 22 RCTs (n = 3176) to compare GnRH antagonists and GnRH agonists (<A HREF="http://archie.cochrane.org/sections/documents/view?version=48477926069055880290110606143734&amp;format=REVMAN#REF-Kolibianakis--2006#REF-Kolibianakis--2006">Kolibianakis 2006</A>). The reported outcome measure, clinical pregnancy or ongoing pregnancy, was converted to live births in 12 studies using the published data. No evidence of a difference was detected in the probability of a live birth between the two GnRH analogues (OR 0.86, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.02). The result remained stable in a subgroup analysis that ordered the studies by type of population studied, gonadotrophin type used for stimulation, type of agonist protocol used, type of agonist used, type of antagonist protocol used, type of antagonist used, presence of allocation concealment, presence of co-intervention and the way the information on live births was retrieved.</LI>
<LI>A systematic review and meta-analysis, <A HREF="http://archie.cochrane.org/sections/documents/view?version=48477926069055880290110606143734&amp;format=REVMAN#REF-Franco-2006#REF-Franco-2006">Franco 2006</A>, evaluated the efficacy of gonadotrophin antagonist versus GnRH agonist in poor ovarian responders in IVF and ICSI cycles. The review included six RCTs that compared GnRH antagonist to long or short GnRH agonist. There was no difference between GnRH antagonist and GnRH agonist (long and flare-up protocols) with respect to cycle cancellation rate, number of mature oocytes and clinical pregnancy rate per cycle initiated, per oocyte retrieval and per embryo transfer. When the meta-analysis was applied to the two trials that had used GnRH antagonist versus long protocols of GnRH agonist, a significantly higher number of retrieved oocytes was observed in the GnRH antagonist protocols (MD 1.12, 95% CI 0.18 to 2.05; P = 0.018).</LI>
<LI>In another systematic review and meta-analysis of four RCTs (n = 874) ongoing pregnancy rate was the main outcome (<A HREF="http://archie.cochrane.org/sections/documents/view?version=48477926069055880290110606143734&amp;format=REVMAN#REF-Griesinger-2008#REF-Griesinger-2008">Griesinger 2008</A>). There was no evidence of a statistically significant difference between women with and without OCP pre-treatment (OR 0.74, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.03). Duration of gonadotrophin stimulation (1.41 days, 95% CI 1.13 to 1.68) and gonadotrophin consumption (542 IU, 95% CI 127 to 956) were significantly increased after OCP pre-treatment. No significant differences were observed regarding the number of retrieved oocytes.</LI>

<P>In view of the shortcomings noted in the included studies, especially with regard to the methods of reporting of trial procedures, more properly designed studies in accordance with the CONSORT statement are need to further evaluate the effectiveness and safety of the GnRH antagonist protocol (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 2010</LINK>). For example, it would be desirable to have trials with low risk of bias with primary outcomes of live birth and OHSS. In addition, further studies are needed to assess this treatment regimen in poor and high responders. We attempted to subgroup treatment regimens by the ovulation triggering agent but no data were available for a proper analysis, as the majority of the included studies either used hCG or did not specify their triggering agents. This is a potential area to be explored by future research. It is also important to understand why pregnancy outcomes have become progressively more favourable with the use of GnRH antagonists. One possible explanation for this could be a decrease in LH instability. This area should be further investigated. Although not a focus of the current update, the potential effects of OCP pretreatment should be further investigated.</P>
<P>Patient satisfaction surveys should also be undertaken to evaluate their impression about GnRH antagonist treatment regimens.</P>

<B>GnRH agonist</B>: in the OC-scheduled group, women started taking a combined OC pill (30 µg ethinyl oestradiol/150 µg desogestrel) Marvelon® (NV Organon) on day 1 of the menstrual cycle. They took it daily for between 14 and 28 days, depending on the planned start of rFSH treatment</P>
<P>Women in the <B>nafarelin group</B> started pretreatment with the GnRH agonist nafarelin (Synarel®; Pharmacia, Australia) on day 21 - 24 of the preceding cycle. Nafarelin was administered intranasally at a daily dose of 0.8 mg until and including the day of hCG administration</P>
<P>In all three groups ovarian stimulation was performed with rFSH (follitropin beta, Puregon®; NV Organon, The Netherlands), which was administered SC once daily in the morning at a fixed dose of 200 IU during the first 5 - 6 days. After this period the dosage of rFSH could be adjusted depending on the ovarian response as assessed by ultrasound. Treatment was continued until (and including) the day of hCG administration. In the OC-scheduled ganirelix group, stimulation with rFSH was started two days after discontinuation of the OC (irrespective of whether or not menses had started), in the non-scheduled group on day 2 - 3 of the menstrual cycle and in the nafarelin group after 2 - 4 weeks of nafarelin treatment [as soon as pituitary down-regulation had been achieved (i.e. serum estradiol 50 pg/ml or 200 pmol/l); if this stage was not achieved after four weeks of nafarelin treatment, the subject discontinued].</P>
<P>hCG, 10,000 IU in 1 ml saline (Pregnyl®, NV Organon, the Netherlands), was administered, either SC or IM, when at least three follicles 17 mm or at least one follicle 20 mm were observed on ultrasound. In case of risk of OHSS, the hCG dose was reduced to 5000 IU.</P>

<P>Prior to the start of treatment, a physical and gynaecological examination was performed to exclude any abnormality. Blood samples were taken for routine biochemistry, haematology, and hormonal parameters. A pregnancy test (urinary hCG) was performed. Blood samples for hormone assessments were taken just before the first rFSH injection (treatment day 1) and at least once every two days from day 5/6 of rFSH treatment (in the antagonist groups just before ganirelix injection) up to and including the day of hCG. Serum FSH, LH, estradiol, and progesterone values were determined by means of the automated Wallac AutoDelfia Fluoroimmunoassay system (PerkinElmer Inc., Wellesley MA, USA) at a central laboratory (ABL BV, Assen, The Netherlands). The maximum intra-assay and inter-assay coefficients of variation were 3.3% for FSH, 3.4% for LH, 4.9% for estradiol, and 4.3% for progesterone. To measure follicular development, ultrasonography was performed at least once every two days from day 5/6 of rFSH treatment up to and including the day of hCG. </P>
<P>Other parameters assessed were treatment failure (defined as the number of women who did not have an hCG injection or who received an hCG injection because of premature luteinisation), number of LH rises (LH = 10 IU/l), number of oocytes retrieved, number of good quality embryos (grade 1 (defined as excellent: no fragmentation) and grade 2 (defined as good: 1 - 20% fragmentation)), fertilisation rate, implantation rate, and ongoing pregnancy rate (assessed by ultrasound = 12 - 16 weeks after embryo transfer)</P>

<B>GnRH antagonist protocol</B>: rFSH treatment was begun on day 3 of the menstrual cycle. The starting dose for the first five days varied between 150 and 450 IU, depending on age and previous experience and was administered daily by SC injection. Thereafter, the dose was adjusted on the basis of ultrasonographic and analytic findings. On day 6 of rFSH treatment, cetrorelix was started if the ovarian response was adequate (at least one follicle = 13 mm or serum estradiol levels = 400 pg/mL). If the ovarian response was not adequate, cetrorelix administration was postponed until ultrasonographic or analytic criteria were achieved <B>(Flexible)</B>. 250 microgram was administered daily by SC injection. When at least three follicles = 17 mm were observed, rFSH and cetrorelix administration was interrupted and hCG (10,000 IU IM) was administered for the timed oocyte retrieval 35 h later. Vaginal micronised progesterone was started 24 h after oocyte retrieval for luteal support in a standard dose of 600 mg daily for 14 days. Serum hCG was to be measured approximately two weeks after embryo transfer. Any pregnancy was confirmed by vaginal ultrasound scan at six weeks' gestation<BR/>
<B>GnRH agonist protocol</B>: on cycle days 21 - 23, 0.6 mg of buserelin acetate was started, by daily SC injection until menses had begun and adequate suppression was achieved (serum estradiol level = 50 pg/mL), at which time treatment with rFSH was started. The starting dose for the first five days varied between 150 and 450 IU, depending on age and previous experience of the participant and was administered daily by SC injection. Thereafter, the dose was adjusted on the basis of ultrasonographic and analytic findings and the cycle management was the same in both groups<BR/>

<P>The main outcome measures for assessing efficacy and safety of both protocols were: the clinical pregnancy rate per cycle and per transfer (gestational sac visualised on ultrasound at six weeks' gestation), number of oocytes collected, number of days of stimulation, number of days of analogue administration and the number of detected cases of moderate and severe OHSS. Other variables assessed were the total amount of rFSH used, serum estradiol level on the day of hCG administration, number of follicles = 15 mm on the day of the oocyte retrieval, endometrial thickness on the day of the oocyte retrieval, fertilisation rate, quality of the embryos transferred and the number of cancelled cycles.<BR/>The quality of embryos used for transfer were classified using the following grading system: (A) no fragmentation; (B) 1% - 20% fragmentation; (C) 21% - 50% fragmentation; (D) = 51% fragmentation.
