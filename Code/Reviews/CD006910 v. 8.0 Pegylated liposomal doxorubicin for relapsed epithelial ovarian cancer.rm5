<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>The choice of chemotherapy in women with relapsed epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is influenced by the duration of the platinum-free interval, the length of time from the last platinum-based cycle to the time of disease progression. Women who relapse within one month of receiving platinum therapy or who progress on therapy are considered to be platinum-refractory; women who relapse between one and six months after platinum therapy are considered to be platinum-resistant; and women who relapse more than six months after platinum therapy are considered to be platinum-sensitive. The latter group is further subgrouped by women who relapse between six and 12 months after platinum therapy (partially platinum-sensitive) and those who relapse after 12 months.</P>
<P>Doxirubicin hydrochloride is an anti-cancer drug that works by interfering with cancer cell DNA. A newer form of doxorubicin called pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD) has been developed with a coating that allows it to reach higher concentrations in cancer cells and with less adverse effects on the heart.</P>
<P>
<B>Review question</B>
</P>
<P>We conducted this review to determine whether PLD was effective and safe compared with other drugs used for relapsed EOC.</P>
<P>
<B>Main findings</B>
</P>
<P>We searched electronic databases and other resources for studies of PLD for relapsed ovarian cancerEOC, and included 14 studies up to October 2012. Most of these studies (12/14) were funded by drug manufacturers with a commercial interest in PLD (two studies) or the comparator drugs (10 studies). For women with platinum-sensitive relapsed EOC, we pooled data from two studies (1164 participants) that compared carboplatin plus PLD (PLD/carbo) with standard treatment (paclitaxel plus carbo (PAC/carbo)). Women survived for a similar length of time overall on these two treatments but the cancer took longer to progress in those receiving PLD/carbo. Women who received PLD experienced more severe low blood cell counts than the standard treatment. By comparison, women in the standard treatment group experienced more severe hair loss, nerve damage, allergic reactions, and joint and muscle pain. More women in the standard treatment group stopped treatment early suggesting that PLD/carbo was better tolerated than standard treatment. We concluded that PLD/carbo was a better treatment option than PAC/carbo for platinum-sensitive relapsed EOC.</P>
<P>Five studies compared PLD to five other chemotherapy drugs. The numbers of participants in these studies ranged from 97 to 829 women and we did not pool these data. PLD worked as least as well as the other agents and was comparatively well-tolerated. In all studies, hand-foot syndrome (HFS: swollen, painful, red, cracked and peeled soles and palms) occurred more frequently in the PLD group.</P>
<P>Three studies compared PLD plus another drug (canfosfamide (CAN), vintafolide (EC145) or trabectedin (TBD)) to PLD alone. The final results of the CAN study were not reported. The numbers of participants in the other studies ranged from 149 to 672 women and we did not pool these data. Women receiving the PLD/TBD combination treatment progressed six weeks later than those getting PLD only, however they did not live longer overall, and the combination treatment was associated with additional harmful effects. EC145 may improve survival in women with platinum-resistant relapsed ovarian cancer when combined with PLD; this combination is currently under investigation in a large trial. Although HFS can be severely disabling, we noted that it occurred much less frequently when lower doses of PLD were used.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
</P>
<P>We consider the evidence related to the longer time to cancer progression with PLD/carbo for platinum-sensitive relapsed ovarian cancer to be of a high quality. There is currently insufficient evidence to support the use of other PLD combination treatments in relapsed EOC.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2013-07-03 12:10:43 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Ovarian cancer is the eighth most common cancer in women and it is usually diagnosed at an advanced stage. The majority of ovarian tumours are epithelial in origin. Women with relapsed epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) often have a reduced performance status with a limited life expectancy, therefore maintaining quality of life with effective symptom control is the main purpose of treatment. Drug treatment of relapsed disease is directed by the platinum-free interval: relapsed platinum-sensitive disease is usually re-treated with platinum-based therapy and platinum-resistant disease challenged with non-platinum drugs. However, the side-effects of chemotherapy agents may be severe and optimal treatment regimens are unclear. Pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD), which contains a cytotoxic drug called doxorubicin hydrochloride is one of several treatment modalities that may be considered for single-agent treatment of relapsed EOC, or used in combination with other drugs.</P>

</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-07-03 12:10:49 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included 14 RCTs that evaluated PLD alone or in combination with other drugs. Four RCTs contributed no data to the meta-analyses. Two studies compared PLD plus carboplatin (carbo) to paclitaxel (PAC)/carbo in women with platinum-sensitive relapsed EOC. Overall survival (OS) was similar for these treatments, however progression-free survival (PFS) was longer with PLD/carbo (1164 participants; hazard ratio (HR) 0.85, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.74 to 0.97; I² = 7%; P value 0.01). PLD/carbo was associated with significantly more anaemia and thrombocytopenia than PAC/carbo, whereas PAC/carbo was associated with significantly more alopecia, neuropathies, hypersensitivity reactions and arthralgias/myalgias. PLD/carbo was well-tolerated and women receiving this treatment were significantly less likely to discontinue treatment than those receiving PAC/carbo (two studies, 1150 participants; risk ratio (RR) 0.38, 95% CI 0.26 to 0.57; I² = 0%; P &lt; 0.00001).</P>
<P>Five studies compared other agents to PLD alone. None of these agents were associated with significantly better survival or severe adverse-event profiles than PLD. Topotecan and gemcitabine were associated with significantly more haematological severe adverse events than PLD, and patupilone was associated with significantly more severe neuropathies and diarrhoea. Severe hand-foot syndrome (HFS) occurred consistently more frequently with PLD than the other drugs.</P>
<P>Three studies compared PLD combination treatment to PLD alone. Two combinations resulted in a significantly longer PFS compared with PLD alone: trabectedin (TBD)/PLD (one study, 672 women; HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.65 to 0.96; P value 0.02) and vintafolide (EC145)/PLD (one study, 149 women; HR 0.63, 95% CI 0.41 to 0.97; P value 0.04). TBD/PLD appeared to benefit the partially platinum-sensitive subgroup only. Further studies are likely to have an important impact on our confidence in these estimates. TBD/PLD was associated with significantly more haematological and gastrointestinal severe adverse events than PLD alone, whereas EC145/PLD appeared to be well-tolerated.</P>
<P>For platinum-resistant relapsed EOC, the median PFS and OS for single-agent PLD across seven included studies was 15 weeks and 54 weeks, respectively. Severe HFS occurred significantly more frequently in women receiving a 50 mg/m² dose of PLD than those receiving less than 50 mg/m² (17% versus 2%, respectively; P value 0.01).</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2013-07-03 12:09:59 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In platinum-sensitive relapsed epithelial ovarian cancer, PLD/carbo is more effective than PAC/carbo and is better tolerated; PLD/carbo should therefore be considered as first-line treatment in women with platinum-sensitive relapsed EOC. PLD alone is a useful agent for platinum-resistant relapsed EOC, however it remains unclear how it compares with other single agents for this subgroup and in what order these agents should be used. There is insufficient evidence to support the use of PLD in combination with other agents in platinum-resistant relapsed EOC.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2013-07-03 12:15:10 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Ovarian cancer is the eighth most common cancer in women worldwide and is responsible for approximately 225,500 new cancer cases per annum (<LINK REF="REF-Jemel-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jemel 2011</LINK>). In Europe it is the fifth most common cancer in women and the sixth most common cause of cancer deaths (<LINK REF="REF-Ferlay-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ferlay 2013</LINK>). The cumulative risk of getting the disease is approximately 1% in developed countries (Europe, Northern America, Australia/New Zealand and Japan) and 0.5% in the rest of the world (<LINK REF="REF-GLOBOCAN-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">GLOBOCAN 2008</LINK>), and the risk increases with age.   </P>
<P>As the disease is characterised by the absence of early specific symptoms, approximately 60% to 70% of women with ovarian cancer are diagnosed with FIGO stages III to IV (<LINK REF="REF-ICBP-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">ICBP 2012</LINK>), having widespread tumour dissemination within and beyond the abdominal cavity (<LINK REF="REF-Jemal-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jemal 2008</LINK>) (see <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK> for FIGO staging). For stage I ovarian cancer, the five-year survival rate approaches 90% (<LINK REF="REF-SEER-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">SEER 2007</LINK>), whereas the five-year survival rate for stage IV is less than 20% (<LINK REF="REF-SEER-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">SEER 2007</LINK>). Overall, in Europe and the United States, for women with any stage of ovarian cancer, the five-year survival rate is around 40% (<LINK REF="REF-EUROCARE-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">EUROCARE 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-SEER-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">SEER 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) accounts for approximately 90% of all ovarian tumours (<LINK REF="REF-SEER-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">SEER 2007</LINK>). The standard treatment involves surgical removal and cytoreduction of the tumour followed by platinum-based chemotherapy in combination with paclitaxel (<LINK REF="REF-ESMO-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">ESMO 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hennessy-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hennessy 2009</LINK>); carboplatin is favoured over cisplatin due to its less toxic adverse-effect profile (<LINK REF="REF-ESMO-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">ESMO 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NICE-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2003</LINK>). Although most tumours (70% to 80%) initially respond to first-line chemotherapy, most responders eventually relapse and will require further chemotherapy (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2003</LINK>). The choice of subsequent chemotherapy in women with relapsed EOC is influenced by the duration of the platinum-free interval, the length of time from the last platinum-based cycle to the time of disease progression. Women who relapse within one month of receiving platinum therapy or who progress on therapy are considered to be platinum-refractory; women who relapse between one and six months after platinum therapy are considered to be platinum-resistant; and women who relapse more than six months after platinum therapy are considered to be platinum-sensitive (<LINK REF="REF-Pfisterer-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pfisterer 2006</LINK>). The latter group is further subgrouped by women who relapse between six and 12 months after platinum therapy (partially platinum-sensitive) and those who relapse after 12 months.</P>
<P>In women with relapsed platinum-sensitive disease it is standard practice to re-treat with platinum-based therapy (PAC/carbo) unless allergic to platinum compounds, and provided that there is no residual neurological toxicity (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2005</LINK>). This follows <LINK REF="REF-ICON_x002d_4" TYPE="REFERENCE">ICON-4</LINK>, which reported a median progression-free survival (PFS) of three months longer in the combination arm compared with the platinum-only arm (13 versus 10 months), and median overall survival (OS) of five months longer in the combination arm (29 versus 24 months) than the platinum-only arm.</P>
<P>For the group of women with platinum-resistant relapsed EOC, non-platinum agents may be used including paclitaxel, topotecan, gemcitabine and pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD) (<LINK REF="REF-Naumann-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Naumann 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NICE-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2005</LINK>). However, response rates in this group are poor (10% to 15%) and OS is approximately 12 months (<LINK REF="REF-Naumann-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Naumann 2011</LINK>).</P>

<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2013-07-01 21:48:52 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Doxorubicin hydrochloride is a cytotoxic drug that has been available since the 1960s and belongs to the group 'anthracyclines' (<LINK REF="REF-EMA-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">EMA 2010</LINK>). Its main mode of action is to bind with topoisomerase II and DNA, forming a complex which results in lethal double-stranded DNA breaks (<LINK REF="REF-Zunino-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zunino 2002</LINK>). Although anthracyclines are effective anti-tumour agents, they are known to cause cardiotoxicity (<LINK REF="REF-Zunino-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zunino 2002</LINK>). Liposomal doxorubicin was developed with the aim of reducing the risk of cardiotoxicity compared with conventional doxorubicin whilst preserving its anti-tumour effect (<LINK REF="REF-Theodoulou-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Theodoulou 2004</LINK>). PLD is a formulation of liposomal doxorubicin coated in polyethylene glycol (PEG). This hydrophilic coating protects the liposomes from detection by the body's reticular endothelial system, reducing the rate at which the active substance is broken down, and increasing its circulating half-life compared with conventional and liposomal doxorubicin (<LINK REF="REF-Gabizon-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gabizon 2001</LINK>). Pegylated liposomes are small enough to extravasate out of leaky tumour vasculature (<LINK REF="REF-CAELYX-PI" TYPE="REFERENCE">CAELYX PI</LINK>) and the lack of functional lymphatic drainage results in high uptake and retention of PLD by the tumour. In addition, the increased circulating time conferred by the pegylation increases the number of passes the drug makes though the tumour microvasculature, which ultimately results in a higher delivered dose to the tumour (<LINK REF="REF-Gabizon-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gabizon 2001</LINK>). Compared with conventional doxorubicin, PLD is associated with a significantly lower risk of cardiotoxicity, which is thought to be due to the tight capillary junctions in the cardiac muscle that limit the concentrations of the drug in this tissue (<LINK REF="REF-Theodoulou-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Theodoulou 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>For women with relapsed ovarian cancer, PLD is recommended at a starting dose of 50 mg/m² intravenously every four weeks for six cycles if tolerated and if the disease does not progress (<LINK REF="REF-EMA-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">EMA 2010</LINK>). However, several recent studies have used lower doses, particularly when PLD has been combined with other agents (30 to 45 mg/m²; <LINK REF="STD-CALYPSO-2010" TYPE="STUDY">CALYPSO 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-HeCOG-2010" TYPE="STUDY">HeCOG 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-OVA_x002d_301-2010" TYPE="STUDY">OVA-301 2010</LINK>), in an attempt to reduce side-effects, and a dose of 40 mg/m² every four weeks is commonly used in clinical practice. The most common side-effect of PLD is nausea (<LINK REF="REF-EMA-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">EMA 2010</LINK>), however, other side-effects frequently associated with PLD include palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia (also known as hand-foot syndrome), stomatitis and neutropenia (abnormally low number of circulating white blood cells - neutrophils) (<LINK REF="REF-CAELYX-PI" TYPE="REFERENCE">CAELYX PI</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-EMA-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">EMA 2010</LINK>). Hand-foot syndrome usually occurs after two or three cycles and can be severely disabling, leading to dose reductions or discontinuation. Grade 3 to 4 severity is reported to occur in approximately 20% of women who start PLD therapy at the 50 mg/m² dose (<LINK REF="REF-Lorusso-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lorusso 2007</LINK>). Numerous approaches to hand-foot syndrome management have been described, however, there is an absence of high-quality evidence to support these strategies (<LINK REF="REF-von-Moos-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">von Moos 2008</LINK>).</P>

<P>PLD has been incorporated into relapsed ovarian cancer treatment guidelines and in the UK is currently recommended as a treatment option for women whose disease does not respond to, and those women whose disease relapses within 12 months from, initial platinum-based therapy (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2005</LINK>); however several studies have been completed since the publication of these guidelines. Recently published studies include <LINK REF="STD-CALYPSO-2010" TYPE="STUDY">CALYPSO 2010</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-HeCOG-2010" TYPE="STUDY">HeCOG 2010</LINK>, that favourably compared PLD plus carboplatin to paclitaxel plus carboplatin for platinum-sensitive disease (i.e. relapsed ovarian cancer occurring greater than six months from prior treatment) in terms of survival. Thus, it is possible that existing guidelines require updating.</P>
<P>PLD manufacturers recently experienced production problems (<LINK REF="REF-DOXIL-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">DOXIL 2011</LINK>) and manufacture was halted for almost two years, resulting in the disruption of individual care and the suspension of some ongoing trials (<LINK REF="STD-INOVATYON" TYPE="STUDY">INOVATYON</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-TRINOVA_x002d_2" TYPE="STUDY">TRINOVA-2</LINK>). Production has now resumed and PLD is no longer a hypothetical option. However, the optimal dosing regimen of PLD remains unclear, as does the relative efficacy and adverse effects of PLD compared with, and combined with, other new agents. Drug treatment of relapsed EOC is a very dynamic field and, to our knowledge, a systematic review of PLD has not been conducted, and is necessary. By conducting a comprehensive systematic review of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of PLD in women with platinum-sensitive or platinum-resistant relapsed EOC, we aimed to evaluate its efficacy and safety compared with other chemotherapy options.</P>

<P>Data on outcomes were extracted as follows.</P>
<UL>
<LI>For time-to-event data (OS and PFS), we abstracted the hazard ratio (HR), log of the hazard ratio (log(HR)) and its standard error (SE) from trial reports where possible. If these were not reported, we attempted to estimate them from other reported statistics using the methods of <LINK REF="REF-Parmar-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parmar 1998</LINK> (e.g. number of events in each arm and log-rank P-value comparing the relevant outcomes in each arm). If it was not possible to estimate the HR, we abstracted the number of patients in each treatment arm who experienced the outcome of interest at a specific time point, in order to estimate a risk ratio (RR).</LI>
<LI>For dichotomous outcomes (e.g. adverse events), we abstracted the number of patients in each treatment arm who experienced the outcome of interest and the number of patients assessed at endpoint, in order to estimate a RR.</LI>
<LI>For continuous outcomes (e.g. QoL measures), we abstracted the mean difference (MD) and standard deviation (SD) between the final value of the outcome measure in each treatment arm at the end of follow-up. If SDs of final values were not available, change scores were used if their SDs were available. If no SDs were available, these trials were omitted from the analyses.</LI>
</UL>
<P>Where possible, we extracted data relevant to an intention-to-treat analysis (ITT), in which participants were analysed in groups to which they were assigned. Where time-to-event outcomes were assessed by more than one method, e.g. independent radiology review, investigator assessment or independent oncology review, we used the independent radiology review data. We noted the time points at which outcomes were collected and reported. Where data from several time points were reported, we used the data from the last assessment in our meta-analyses if appropriate. Where a trial evaluated the same drug in two or more different doses versus PLD, we extracted the combined data and the individual data of the most efficacious dose/regimen versus PLD.</P>
<P>Two review authors (TL and AB) independently extracted data from the selected trials using piloted data extraction forms specially designed for the review. Where there was disagreement between the two review authors, this was resolved by discussion with JM.</P>

<P>Two studies were included, which used PLD doses of 30 and 45 mg/m² four-weekly, respectively in women with platinum-sensitive relapsed EOC. Overall survival (OS) was similar for the PLD/carbo and PAC/carbo treatments, however, PFS was longer with the PLD/carbo combination. PLD/carbo was associated with significantly more anaemia and thrombocytopenia than PAC/carbo, whereas PAC/carbo was associated with significantly more alopecia, neuropathies, hypersensitivity reactions and arthralgias/myalgias.

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Other drugs versus PLD</HEADING>
<P>Five studies contributed data: only the 'GEM versus PLD' subgroup included more than one study and all studies used a four-weekly PLD dose of 50 mg/m². For all 'other drug' interventions (GEM,TOP, OLA and PAT), PFS was comparable with that of the PLD arms, however we did not pool these data. Similarly, OS was not significantly different for any of the comparative interventions, with the exception of the 'TOP versus PLD' comparison where the OS results of one large study statistically significantly favoured the PLD arm. TOP and GEM were associated with significantly more haematological severe adverse events than PLD, and PAT was associated with significantly more severe neuropathies and diarrhoea. The incidence of hand-foot syndrome was statistically significantly higher in the PLD arms of all subgroup comparisons.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Other drugs plus PLD versus PLD</HEADING>
<P>Three studies compared PLD combination treatment to PLD alone. Combination treatments resulted in a significantly longer PFS compared with the PLD alone for the TBD/PLD and the EC145/PLD treatments, but not for CAN/PLD. The CAN/PLD study (<LINK REF="STD-ASSIST_x002d_5-2010" TYPE="STUDY">ASSIST-5 2010</LINK>) closed early and, since final OS has not been reported, we considered it to be at a high risk of bias. PFS subgroup analysis performed by the <LINK REF="STD-OVA_x002d_301-2010" TYPE="STUDY">OVA-301 2010</LINK> investigators found that a statistically significant benefit in PFS occurred in the partial platinum-sensitive subgroup only. The increase in PFS did not translate into a statistically significant increase in OS in either study, although the point estimate of <LINK REF="STD-OVA_x002d_301-2010" TYPE="STUDY">OVA-301 2010</LINK> favoured the TBD/PLD arm. The phase II EC145/PLD study (<LINK REF="STD-PRECEDENT-2013" TYPE="STUDY">PRECEDENT 2013</LINK>) was not powered to evaluate OS (see <LINK REF="SOF-02" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 2</LINK>).</P>
<P>TBD/PLD was associated with significantly more haematological and gastrointestinal severe adverse events than the PLD alone group, however less hand-foot syndrome and stomatitis were experienced in the combination arm. The reasons for the latter are unclear, however they may be due to the lower PLD dose intensity in the TBD/PLD arm (10 mg/m² versus 12.5 mg/m² per week), or be due to an increase in the haematologically-induced treatment delays that resulted in a lower dose intensity. severe adverse events with EC145/PLD were not significantly different to those occurring with PLD alone.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="6">PLD/carbo versus PAC/carbo for platinum-sensitive relapsed EOC</HEADING>
<P>There is sufficient high quality evidence to show that the PLD/carbo combination results in similar OS to the standard PAC/carbo regimen for platinum-sensitive disease, and improved PFS. In <LINK REF="STD-CALYPSO-2010" TYPE="STUDY">CALYPSO 2010</LINK>, 90% of women received post-progression treatment and the proportion of women in the PAC/carbo arm who received PLD as post-study therapy (68%) was significantly higher than the proportion of women in the PLD/carbo arm who received PAC (43%; P &lt; 0.001); this may have influenced OS HRs in the direction of the PAC/carbo arm. PLD/carbo was well-tolerated compared with PAC/carbo. The majority of women receiving PAC/carbo regimen experienced complete hair loss, compared with less than 10% in the PLD/carbo arm. At the 30 mg/m² dose, the incidence of grade 3 hand-foot syndrome was not significantly difference between the two regimens. There was no statistically significant difference in neutropenia in the meta-analysis of two studies, although evidence from <LINK REF="STD-CALYPSO-2010" TYPE="STUDY">CALYPSO 2010</LINK> suggests that this difference is significant if a 30 mg/m² dose is used, and favours the PLD/carbo combination.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Other drugs versus PLD</HEADING>
<P>Most of these studies included women with platinum-resistant relapsed EOC in whom other agents (GEM, OLA and PAT) were compared with PLD as the active control agent, and which produced similar survival results to PLD. Exceptions were the TOP versus PLD study (<LINK REF="STD-Gordon-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Gordon 2001</LINK>) that included women with platinum-resistant and platinum-sensitive relapsed EOC and found an improved OS with PLD compared with TOP; and <LINK REF="STD-MITO_x002d_3-2008" TYPE="STUDY">MITO-3 2008</LINK> (GEM versus PLD) that included women with platinum-resistant and partial platinum-sensitive relapsed EOC and in which PLD was similarly associated with a significantly longer OS compared with GEM. The OLA versus PLD study (<LINK REF="STD-Kaye-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Kaye 2012</LINK>) was a phase II study that was not powered to assess OS and research is ongoing for this agent. These studies confirm PLD as a good choice for women in whom single-agent therapy is a treatment option. PLD has been compared with PAC in only one study that was never published in full (<LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Byrne-2002" TYPE="STUDY">O'Byrne 2002</LINK>). Since PAC is still the most frequently used single agent for platinum-resistant relapsed EOC, an RCT comparing these drugs would be extremely helpful. Indeed the timing of PLD relative to other treatments cannot be assessed from the current evidence.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">PLD plus other drugs versus PLD alone</HEADING>
<P>More evidence is needed to determine whether the survival benefits of combination treatment in relapsed EOC are worth the often considerable adverse drug effects. In <LINK REF="STD-OVA_x002d_301-2010" TYPE="STUDY">OVA-301 2010</LINK> (TBD/PLD versus PLD alone), OS was not significantly improved in the combination arm despite a statistically significant difference in PFS. The improvement in PFS equated to six weeks longer to progression in the combination group which, given the additional haematological and other toxicities, may not be worth the potential severe adverse-event-associated decrease in quality of life. The RR of vomiting in favour of the PLD only arm is likely to be underestimated in our analysis as women in the TBD/PLD arm also received anti-emetic premedication. <LINK REF="STD-OVA_x002d_301-2010" TYPE="STUDY">OVA-301 2010</LINK> investigators performed subgroup analyses which suggested that the combination treatment may confer a significant PFS and OS benefit (exploratory analysis) to the partial platinum-sensitive subgroup only (see <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>). This evidence has limited applicability as the standard treatment of women with platinum-sensitive relapsed EOC is PAC/carbo (or PLD/carbo). A further study of TBD/PLD has been commenced (<LINK REF="STD-INOVATYON" TYPE="STUDY">INOVATYON</LINK>) comparing TBD/PLD versus standard treatment (PLD/carbo) for this subgroup of women. Although this study had to be suspended due to the PLD shortage, we understand that enrolment is expected to resume (personal communication with investigators). More data should be published on the additional supportive treatment required during and following treatment with TBD/PLD.</P>
<P>To date, the only combination treatment to have shown a significant benefit in PFS over PLD alone in platinum-resistant relapsed EOC is EC145/PLD (21 weeks versus 12 weeks). In this phase II study (<LINK REF="STD-PRECEDENT-2013" TYPE="STUDY">PRECEDENT 2013</LINK>), this combination appeared to be well-tolerated and did not result in a significant increase in severe adverse events, however the investigators reported a statistically significant increase in some adverse events (leucopenia (reduced numbers of white blood cells), neutropenia, abdominal pain and peripheral neuropathy) when all grades were considered. Due to the small size of the study, OS results are unreliable. Thus the evidence is very incomplete and should be clarified following the completion of a large, ongoing, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (<LINK REF="STD-PROCEED" TYPE="STUDY">PROCEED</LINK>).</P>
<P>For completeness, we included the <LINK REF="STD-ASSIST_x002d_5-2010" TYPE="STUDY">ASSIST-5 2010</LINK> study, however, we considered it to be at a high risk of selective reporting and other bias. Based on a review of <LINK REF="STD-ASSIST_x002d_1-2009" TYPE="STUDY">ASSIST-1 2009</LINK> data, this trial was closed early and, to our knowledge, neither the <LINK REF="STD-ASSIST_x002d_1-2009" TYPE="STUDY">ASSIST-1 2009</LINK> review findings nor the overall survival results for either trial have been published. We were unsuccessful in obtaining these missing data from the pharmaceutical company (Telik). We consider it unlikely that further studies of this agent will be conducted in relapsed EOC, despite claims that it is well-tolerated and active in platinum-refractory and platinum-resistant relapsed EOC (<LINK REF="REF-Kavanagh-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kavanagh 2010</LINK>).</P>

<P>PLD has been tested in more than 14 RCTs against standard chemotherapy regimens and novel agents for relapsed EOC. PLD is an effective alternative to PAC, when combined with carboplatin, for combination therapy of platinum-sensitive disease, producing better PFS and similar OS times to PAC/carbo. We consider this evidence to be of a high and moderate quality, respectively (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>). In combination treatment, PLD is well-tolerated in lower dose regimens, which do not adversely affect survival compared with other standard regimens. In addition, there is high quality evidence to show that PLD/carbo causes much less neuropathy and alopecia than PAC/carbo.</P>
<P>As a single-agent in platinum-resistant relapsed EOC, median time to progression across all the studies included in this review was 15 weeks (range nine to 16) and median time to death was 54 weeks (range 36 to 72) (<LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>). PLD is a good option for single-agent salvage treatment of platinum-resistant relapsed EOC when compared to other non-PLD regimens, however, most of these treatment comparisons comprised only one study and meta-analyses could not be performed. Currently the quality of the evidence in favour of other PLD-combination therapy for platinum-resistant (EC145/PLD) and partial platinum-sensitive relapsed EOC (TBD/PLD) is moderate to very low (<LINK REF="SOF-02" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 2</LINK>), therefore, we suggest that these PLD-combinations only be administered within clinical trials, pending further evidence.</P>

<P>We attempted to prevent bias in the review by including grey literature and making every effort to obtain missing data from the investigators; however, we were unable to obtain OS data for <LINK REF="STD-Mutch-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Mutch 2007</LINK>, or any statistically useful data for <LINK REF="STD-ASSIST_x002d_3-2007" TYPE="STUDY">ASSIST-3 2007</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-M200-2009" TYPE="STUDY">M200 2009</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Byrne-2002" TYPE="STUDY">O'Byrne 2002</LINK>. We considered the latter three studies to be at a high risk of bias. They contributed no data but we included them to avoid repeating the publication bias to which they may have been subject.</P>
<P>For most included studies, it was not possible to subgroup data according to the platinum-free interval as stratification had not been performed at the randomisation stage, subgroup results were exploratory, or because there were too few studies to perform meta-analyses. Exploratory results from <LINK REF="STD-MITO_x002d_3-2008" TYPE="STUDY">MITO-3 2008</LINK> (GEM versus PLD) suggest that OS was significantly longer in the PLD arm of the partial platinum-sensitive subgroup only. Similarly, in <LINK REF="STD-OVA_x002d_301-2010" TYPE="STUDY">OVA-301 2010</LINK>, the TBD/PLD arm was associated with a longer PFS and OS compared with the PLD arm in the partial platinum-sensitive subgroup only. Although we did not analyse these data separately, we do not consider this to be a major source of bias; further research is needed here. There are several ongoing studies evaluating PLD treatments for specific subgroups of relapsed EOC (e.g.<LINK REF="STD-INOVATYON" TYPE="STUDY">INOVATYON</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-PROCEED" TYPE="STUDY">PROCEED</LINK>), therefore subgroup analyses should be possible in future versions of this review, when there are more data available.</P>
<P>Some studies only reported severe adverse events if they occurred at a rate of more than 5% or 10%. Where this occurred, we attempted to obtain these unpublished data, however it was not always possible. Therefore, where we estimated rates of severe adverse events or an 'assumed risk' based on the cumulative reported risk rates (e.g. in 'Summary of findings' tables), these rates may be slightly over-estimated. Furthermore, uncommon severe adverse events may therefore not be represented in this review.</P>

<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2013-07-03 12:15:10 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Hand-foot syndrome can be a severely debilitating adverse effect of PLD use and there is little consensus on its management, although dose reduction is considered to have the greatest effect (<LINK REF="REF-von-Moos-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">von Moos 2008</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-Rose-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rose 2005</LINK> suggested the optimum dose of PLD to be 40 mg/m² and this has since been recommended by a European panel of experts (<LINK REF="REF-von-Moos-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">von Moos 2008</LINK>) and others, some of whom have raised serious ethical concerns about the use of the 50 mg/m² dose (<LINK REF="REF-Markman-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Markman 2010</LINK>), which remains the approved dose of the US Food and Drug Administration (<LINK REF="REF-Markman-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Markman 2010</LINK>) and European Medicines Agency (<LINK REF="REF-EMA-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">EMA 2010</LINK>). It is apparently for this reason that most ongoing studies utilise the 50 mg/m<SUP>2</SUP> dose when comparing new agents to PLD (see <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_ONGOING_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of ongoing studies</LINK>).</P>
<P>In this review, grade 3 hand-foot syndrome events occurred with an overall frequency of 2% in women receiving a PLD dose of less than 50 mg/m² and 17% in those receiving a 50 mg/m² dose which, although only an exploratory analysis, seems to strongly support the argument for a lower dose (see <LINK REF="SOF-03" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 3</LINK>). These subgroup data were homogenous (I² = 0%). It was not possible to perform similar exploratory analyses on survival outcomes due to the heterogeneity of the participants (platinum-resistant and platinum-sensitive relapsed EOC) and chemotherapy agents evaluated, however PLD administered at the 40 mg/m² dose has not been associated with reduced efficacy (<LINK REF="REF-Markman-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Markman 2010</LINK>). The review evidence relating to PLD dose is confounded by the routine use of corticosteroid premedication in all the studies employing lower dose regimens. Corticosteroids might prevent or ameliorate hand-foot syndrome, however their role, if any, is uncertain and evidence from RCTs is lacking (<LINK REF="REF-Farr-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Farr 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-von-Moos-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">von Moos 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>In the <LINK REF="STD-OVA_x002d_301-2010" TYPE="STUDY">OVA-301 2010</LINK> study, which we did not include in the exploratory hand-foot syndrome analysis because PLD was given to both arms, women in the combination arm (TBD/PLD) experienced significantly less hand-foot syndrome than women in the PLD only arm. As with our exploratory analysis, this reduction may have been due to the lower dose of PLD used in the combination arm (30 mg/m²) or to the corticosteroid premedication that was given to theTBD arm only, or indeed to the experimental agent (TBD) itself. Similarly, <LINK REF="STD-ASSIST_x002d_5-2010" TYPE="STUDY">ASSIST-5 2010</LINK> reported significantly lower rates of hand-foot syndrome in the combination arm (CAN/PLD) compared with PLD alone (50 mg/m² dose in both arms), however all women in this study (including the PLD only group) received corticosteroid premedication. Therefore, the reason for the decrease in hand-foot syndrome observed in these combination studies remains unclear. It may even be due to the increased rates of bone marrow suppression that occur more frequently with combination treatment, rather than the experimental agents per se. Furthermore, these were open-label studies and detection bias may have played a role. Since improving quality of life is the main aim of treatment in women with platinum-resistant relapsed EOC, in the absence of a randomised trial comparing 40 mg/m² and 50 mg/m² dosage regimens, we agree with <LINK REF="REF-von-Moos-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">von Moos 2008</LINK> and <LINK REF="REF-Markman-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Markman 2010</LINK> in the support of a 40 mg/m² dose for single-agent studies, and recommend that ongoing studies reconsider their PLD dose regimens.</P>

<P>For platinum-sensitive disease, PLD/carbo has greater efficacy than PAC/carbo and treatment guidelines should be updated to include this combination as first-line treatment. Although there was no statistically significant difference in OS, PLD/carbo was associated with a longer PFS and was better tolerated than the standard PAC/carbo regimen. The findings of this review support the continued use of PLD as a single-agent for platinum-resistant relapsed EOC, although it is still unclear how PLD compares with PAC and other agents for platinum-resistant relapsed EOC and in what order these agents should be used. In combination with TBD, PFS was increased in women with partial platinum-sensitive relapsed EOC compared with PLD alone, however it is not clear how TBD/PLD compares to standard treatment for this subgroup. TBD/PLD was associated with significantly more toxicity compared to PLD alone and further evidence is needed before this treatment can be recommended. Ongoing trials should clarify whether PLD-based combination treatments, e.g. EC145/PLD, are of significant benefit to women with platinum-resistant relapsed EOC. We support the use of a PLD dose of not more than 40 mg/m² every four weeks to reduce the incidence of severe hand-foot syndrome in clinical practice and ongoing studies.</P>

<P>The canfosfamide studies (<LINK REF="STD-ASSIST_x002d_1-2009" TYPE="STUDY">ASSIST-1 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-ASSIST_x002d_3-2007" TYPE="STUDY">ASSIST-3 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-ASSIST_x002d_5-2010" TYPE="STUDY">ASSIST-5 2010</LINK>) illustrate the importance of conducting large, double-blind RCTs; the results of phase II studies may suggest survival benefits but can be misleading because of the small numbers of participants and the risk of bias associated with open-label studies. A greater effort should be made by investigators to use double-blind trial methodology in multinational phase III trials. Although the shortage of PLD has had a significant impact on ovarian cancer research in the past two years, the following phase III trials are expected to resume participant enrolment (see <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_ONGOING_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of ongoing studies</LINK>).</P>

<P>There is currently little evidence to support the use of liposomal doxorubicin (Myocet) as a substitute for PLD in ovarian cancer treatment. A phase II study comparing Myocet plus gemcitabine with Myocet alone in platinum-resistant relapsed EOC is apparently ongoing (<LINK REF="STD-NCT01100372" TYPE="STUDY">NCT01100372</LINK>), and two other ongoing studies (<LINK REF="STD-AURELIA" TYPE="STUDY">AURELIA</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-IMC_x002d_383_x002f_NCT00913835" TYPE="STUDY">IMC-383/NCT00913835</LINK>) are evaluating Myocet against other experimental interventions (see <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_ONGOING_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of ongoing studies</LINK>).</P>
<P>Regional cooling (<LINK REF="REF-Mangili-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mangili 2008</LINK>) and corticosteroid premedication may prevent hand-foot syndrome (<LINK REF="REF-Lorusso-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lorusso 2007</LINK>); given the numerous ongoing studies utilising PLD, there appears to be ample opportunity to conduct a concurrent randomised study to determine whether these preventative measures are helpful.</P>

<P>Patients requiring dose reductions for HFS and stomatitis were 15% and 4% respectively, in the intervention arm compared with 42% and 25% respectively in the PLD arm; i.e. CAN appeared to decrease the rate of HFS and stomatitis when combined with PLD.

<P>This study is listed as 'Terminated' on the NCT registry after enrolling 220 women. The only published report is an ASCO 2002 abstract which had no data that could be included in our meta-analyses. Results were reported as follows: 'A preliminary analysis indicates that the overall progression-free survival rates are similar between the two arms (D: 21.7 versus P: 22.4 weeks; P value 0.15). The overall response rates for D and P are 17.8% and 22.4%, respectively (P value 0.34). Median overall survival times are 45.7 weeks for D and 56.1 weeks for P (P value 0.44). No significant difference was seen in median progression-free or overall survival for platinum sensitive or refractory patients in either treatment arm. The overall number of adverse events was equivalent in either arm. Nausea and vomiting, stomatitis and plantar-palmar erythrodysesthesia were seen more frequently with D whereas alopecia, myalgia, arthralgia and paraesthesiae occurred more commonly with P. These findings clearly indicate that D has comparable efficacy to P in taxane naive patients with ROC. D may be particularly suitable for those patients with musculoskeletal disorders or for whom the prospect of alopecia has a significant adverse psychological effect.'</P>

<P>Dexamethasone was given to the TBD group only to reduce hepatic toxicity (personal communication).</P>
<P>When results were subgrouped by platinum sensitivity, only women in the PS ROC group experienced significantly longer PFS with arm 1; i.e. TBD + PLD offered no significant additional benefit over PLD alone for women with PR ROC.

<P>The accrual goal was 900 but study was discontinued due to slow accrual.</P>
<P>Unpublished final survival data related to the 2010 publication was received from investigators on 13/12/12. PFS was significantly improved by the addition of PLD to carbo. The final OS was not statistically significantly different between treatment arms, in contrast to the earlier report of 2008 where OS was significantly longer in the PLD/carbo arm.</P>
<P>Despite using a lower dose of PLD, this trial had a relatively high rate of haematological SAEs (G3 to 4) in the PLD/carbo arm compared with the carbo alone arm (neutropenia 48% versus 3%; anaemia 16% versus 0%; thrombocytopenia 39% versus 10%). Eight women in the carbo arm had allergic reactions (any grade) compared with 0 in the PLD/carbo arm. The HFS rate was 3/31 (10%) in the PLD/carbo arm. The proportion of women in each group who received a dexamethasone premed was not described.</P>
<P>Investigators concluded that PLD/carbo dosing interval was more convenient than the PAC/carbo and GEM/carbo alternatives; that PLD was well tolerated with no significant HFS problems; and that 'administering PLD with carboplatin appears to substantially reduce the incidence of platinum-associated hypersensitivity reactions'.</P>
