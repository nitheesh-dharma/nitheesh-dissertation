<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2014-10-08 12:07:33 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anna Hobson">
<P>Background</P>
<P>Burns are very common and sometimes fatal, and the pain associated with such injury is one of the most difficult types to relieve. The use of high-dose opioid medications like morphine is common, but side effects are encountered. Alternative agents such as lidocaine, an anaesthetic, have been proposed. This is an update of the review of the same name first published in 2007.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>We searched scientific databases for studies assessing the pain-relieving effects of intravenous (given into the blood stream through a vein) lidocaine in adults with a burn injury. We included studies comparing lidocaine with no treatment, placebo (a pretend treatment), other analgesics (pain killers), or a combination of these. We wanted to look at (for example) severity of pain, time to requiring more medication, rescue analgesia (where extra pain relief is needed in addition to that planned) and side effects. The evidence is current to December 2013.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>We found one small clinical trial, involving only 45 participants, which showed a benefit from intravenous lidocaine for pain relief in people with burns. The trial did not show a difference in opioid use, participant anxiety or level of participant satisfaction with the use of intravenous lidocaine.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2014-10-07 11:22:46 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson">
<P>This is an update of the review on "Lidocaine for pain relief in burn injured patients" first published in Issue 3, 2007, and first updated in 2012. Pain is a major issue for people with many different types of wounds, in particular those people with burn injuries. Prompt, aggressive use of opioid analgesics such as morphine has been suggested as critical to avert the cycle of pain and anxiety, but adverse effects are encountered. It has been proposed that newer agents such as lidocaine could be effective in reducing pain and alleviating the escalating opioid dosage requirements in people with burn injury.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2014-10-08 12:07:33 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anna Hobson">
<P>To assess the safety and effectiveness of intravenous lidocaine as a means of pain relief versus no therapy, placebo, other drugs, or a combination of these therapies in people with burn injury.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2014-10-07 11:23:03 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson">
<P>For this third update, we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (Issue 11, 2013), and Ovid MEDLINE, MEDLINE in Process and Ovid EMBASE (up to December 2013).</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2014-10-08 12:07:33 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anna Hobson">
<P>We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and controlled clinical trials (CCTs), published and unpublished, which assessed the efficacy of intravenous lidocaine in varying doses as a single-agent therapy with no therapy, placebo, other analgesics (such as opioids), lidocaine plus another drug, or a combination of these therapies as a means of pain relief in people with burn injury.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2011-08-04 12:33:38 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two review authors independently abstracted data and assessed the risk of bias of the studies identified.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-10-08 12:07:33 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anna Hobson">
<P>In this 2014 update, we found no new studies. The one small randomised double-blind placebo-controlled cross-over trial found in 2012, which included only 45 participants and compared intravenous lidocaine against placebo as a means of pain relief in people with burns still remains central to this review. We assessed this study as being at a high risk of bias due to its small size (fewer than 50 participants per treatment arm). Subjective pain ratings, as measured by the verbal rating scale, increased during procedures for both treatment arms; however, the increase was less in the lidocaine treatment group. There were no significant clinical or statistical differences regarding the effects of lidocaine and placebo on opioid requests and consumption, anxiety or level of satisfaction during a wound care procedure, but the small included study provided insufficient data to draw any conclusions.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2014-10-08 12:07:33 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anna Hobson">
<P>As current clinical evidence is based on only one RCT as well as case series and reports, intravenous lidocaine must be considered a pharmacological agent under investigation in burns care, the effectiveness of which is yet to be determined with further well-designed and conducted clinical trials.</P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2014-10-08 12:07:33 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anna Hobson">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2014-10-08 12:07:33 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anna Hobson">
<P>This is an update of the review on "Lidocaine for pain relief in burn injured patients" first published in 2007 (<LINK REF="REF-Wasiak-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wasiak 2007</LINK>). Burn injuries are a particularly emotive injury with which pain is frequently associated. Burn pain continues to be an ongoing issue of investigation and concern (<LINK REF="REF-Dauber-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dauber 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Richardson-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Richardson 2009</LINK>). Inflammatory reactions pursuant to injured tissue or nerves may result in the overproduction of inflammatory mediators, which may result in allodynia and primary hyperalgesia in injured areas and secondary hyperalgesia in surrounding tissue (<LINK REF="REF-Meyer-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meyer 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Richardson-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Richardson 2009</LINK>). Repetitive painful stimuli can cause neuroplastic adaptations throughout the central nervous system whereby pain afferent sensory impulses undergo facilitation and amplification to a given stimulus, contributing to the generation and maintenance of chronic pain (<LINK REF="REF-Richardson-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Richardson 2009</LINK>). Pain from burn injuries has been associated with several mental health conditions such as depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder and suicide (<LINK REF="REF-Edwards-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Edwards 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Summer-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Summer 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>Opioid analgesics, and in particular intravenous opiates, have long been the mainstay of analgesia for procedure-related burn pain. However, use of high-dose opiates can be associated with both short-term adverse effects, including respiratory depression and constipation, as well as long-term consequences, such as the development of tolerance and reward-based behaviour to opiate medication.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2014-10-07 11:24:23 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson">
<P>Lidocaine (also named lignocaine) is a local anaesthetic agent of the amide type that has been used for local anaesthesia and systemically as an anti-arrhythmic drug. Intravenous lidocaine has been proposed as a means to alleviate the debilitating effects of various types of pain and is currently used in the management of many acute, chronic and neuropathic pain conditions (<LINK REF="REF-Edwards-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Edwards 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ferrante-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ferrante 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hand-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hand 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Koppert-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Koppert 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McLeane-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">McLeane 2001</LINK>). The most common timing of use of analgesia tends to be during debridement. Systemic lidocaine has also been reported to be effective in treating burn injury in numerous case series, case studies and experimental studies (<LINK REF="STD-Cassuto-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Cassuto 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Holthusen-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Holthusen 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-J_x00f6_nsson-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Jönsson 1991</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2014-10-07 11:24:28 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson">
<P>Lidocaine reversibly binds to subunits of voltage-gated sodium channels in the nerve membrane, consequently inhibiting nerve conduction. The depression of conduction in afferent nerves secondary to lidocaine administration may act to modify pain in people with burns, and avoid the adverse effects of high-dose opiates during procedures associated with burn management likely to elicit repetitive painful stimuli.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2014-10-07 11:24:36 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson">
<P>Several clinical trials have attempted to use non-opioid therapies to treat procedural pain with mixed degrees of success (<LINK REF="REF-Finn-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Finn 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Harandi-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harandi 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Konstantatos-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Konstantatos 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zor-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zor 2010</LINK>). Although many burns units employ several different therapies, there is still no widely accepted alternative or uniform adjunctive treatment to intravenous opioids for the management of procedural burn pain supported by meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials (RCTs). Given the importance of pain control in acute burn injuries, further evidence should be sought with respect to non-opioid analgesic agents, particularly in the context of procedural pain control. As systemic lidocaine is safe and effective for the management of some neuropathic conditions that have been refractory to standard interventions, we anticipated that we could establish that systemic lidocaine may help reduce the pain of burns.</P>

<P>In the original review in 2007, we identified 25 references. Independent scrutiny of the titles and abstracts identified five potentially relevant studies. Of the five potentially relevant studies, we excluded four studies because they did not address primary outcome measures (<LINK REF="STD-Holthusen-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Holthusen 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mattsson-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Mattsson 2000</LINK>), or used alternative study designs such as case reports (<LINK REF="STD-Cassuto-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Cassuto 2003</LINK>), or case series (<LINK REF="STD-J_x00f6_nsson-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Jönsson 1991</LINK>).

<P>We included one small cross-over RCT that we found in 2012 (<LINK REF="STD-Wasiak-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Wasiak 2011</LINK>). In <LINK REF="STD-Wasiak-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Wasiak 2011</LINK>, 47 participants were initially recruited although only 45 participants had burn injuries (mean per cent total body surface area (TBSA) 12.96%, range 3% to 55%). Participants were undergoing wound care procedures (i.e. dressing changes or debridement, or both) over two consecutive days following split skin-graft surgery. They were randomised to receive lidocaine 1.5 mg/kg/body weight followed by two boluses of 0.5 mg/kg at five-minute intervals followed by a continuous infusion or control (0.9% sodium chloride) administered at an equivalent volume, dose and rate to that of lidocaine. The primary outcomes measured were change in VRS scores measured before, during and after the procedure; time to rescue analgesia; opioid requests and consumption using patient-controlled analgesia (PCA); and overall participant anxiety and level of satisfaction. Subjective pain ratings as measured by the VRS increased during procedures for both treatment arms; however, the increase was less for the lidocaine treatment arm. <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK> presents the results for the individual study.</P>

<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Wasiak-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Wasiak 2011</LINK> reported that VRS scores were significantly lower for lidocaine (0.34) compared with placebo (0.70) when measured before, during and after the procedure (difference 0.36, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.55; P value &lt; 0.001). Rescue analgesia was required during six wound care procedures, all involving the removal of staples. During the six procedures, all participants had required intravenous ketamine during dressing procedures prior to rescue analgesia; four participants during the lidocaine arm, one during the placebo arm and one during both. Comparison of opioid demand and consumption showed no significant clinical or statistical differences between lidocaine and placebo arms. Measures of overall anxiety and satisfaction levels showed no appreciable difference between the groups. There were no significant clinical or statistical differences between the lidocaine and placebo arms with regards to anxiety scores prior to or after the wound care procedures.</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2014-10-08 12:07:33 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anna Hobson">
<P>This review aimed to assess the safety and effectiveness of intravenous lidocaine as a means of pain relief versus no therapy, placebo, other drugs or a combination of these therapies in people with to burn injury.</P>
<P>Intravenous lidocaine has been a well-documented treatment for other clinical conditions such as cardiac arrhythmias and neuropathic pain. In the setting of burns pain, there has been growing evidence in the form of case reports or case series to suggest that lidocaine can improve the analgesic efficacy, alleviate the deleterious effect of opioid administration and minimise the necessity of escalating opioid dosages in people with thermal injury although we excluded these from our original search (<LINK REF="STD-Cassuto-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Cassuto 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Edwards-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Edwards 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-J_x00f6_nsson-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Jönsson 1991</LINK>).</P>
<P>Several mechanisms have been proposed for this action, namely that systemic lidocaine can depress conduction in afferent nerves, inhibit dorsal horn neural transmission and modify the cerebral perception of pain (<LINK REF="REF-Abelson-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Abelson 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Attal-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Attal 2000</LINK>). In addition, it has been postulated that burn injury is likely to trigger the release of inflammatory agents such as histamine, serotonin and prostaglandins, which in turn could trigger nociceptive impulses, making lidocaine's potent anti-inflammatory properties integral to the suppression of pain (<LINK REF="REF-Edwards-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Edwards 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>We included only one small study involving the addition of lidocaine infusions to PCA morphine as compared with placebo involving 45 randomised people with burn injury (<LINK REF="STD-Wasiak-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Wasiak 2011</LINK>). Outcomes included pain intensity as measured by VRS, time to rescue analgesia, opioid requests and consumption, and overall anxiety and level of satisfaction. There were statistically significant differences in VRS score, which was lower in people treated with lidocaine as compared with placebo; however, there were no statistically significant differences with respect to other primary outcomes. Of importance, lidocaine administration did not result in a significantly lower demand by participants for opioids. The study was conducted in a burns centre in Melbourne, Australia where the authors of the trial acknowledge that the standard opioid-based pain management regimens of the unit usually lead to a high degree of satisfactory pain control. In this context, it may have been difficult to improve upon an already established baseline of pain control and this limits generalisability of this trial to clinical practice in burn centres where opioid-based pain management has not been optimised or is contraindicated in certain people.</P>
<P>While the included study did not show a reduction in opioid consumption or demand, or a difference in degree of participant satisfaction while the adjuvant use of intravenous lidocaine for pain relief during burn wound dressing changes was administered, the use of intravenous lidocaine as a form of pain relief at other stages during burn wound management remains unexplored in the form of RCTs. Given that several RCTs in a non-burn context and case series involving people with burns highlight that intravenous lidocaine may lead to a reduction in participants' procedural and background pain levels, lead to less opiate requirements and consequently fewer associated complications, there is a need for larger RCTs to assess the utility of intravenous lidocaine in people with burns.</P>

<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2014-10-08 12:07:33 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anna Hobson">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2014-10-08 12:07:33 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anna Hobson">
<P>The first update in 2012 identified one study for inclusion, and the conclusions from the original review were changed. This 2014 update did not identify any further eligible studies. The findings of this review update indicate that the use of intravenous lidocaine as an adjunctive analgesic agent in combination with morphine (patient-controlled analgesia), although appearing to be well tolerated, confers little benefit on opioid consumption and demand, participant anxiety and satisfaction or time to rescue analgesia. However, these findings were based on one small single institution study where the intervention was implemented during procedural dressing changes. For this reason, it is impossible to draw any meaningful conclusions about the effect of intravenous lidocaine on burn-associated pain at other stages in burn management, such as for pain control during the acute stages of presentation or in the management of chronic pain.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2014-10-07 11:28:31 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson">
<P>In order to evaluate the effect of intravenous lidocaine as an analgesic agent in burn-related injuries in a procedural context better, more research in the form of clinical randomised controlled trials (RCTs) should be undertaken with greater sample sizes and across multiple institutions. Future RCTs assessing the clinical effectiveness and safety should be undertaken at different stages of presentation in people with burns. Examples might include early in the person's admission to a burns centre and, where possible, before initiation of high-dose opiate medications or for the treatment of chronic pain refractory to opiates or anti-neuropathic medications.</P>
