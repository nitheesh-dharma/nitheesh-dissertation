<SUMMARY>
<TITLE>Dan Shen agents for acute ischaemic stroke</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Animal experiments in clinical practice suggest that Dan Shen agents might improve cerebral microcirculation. This review identified six randomised or quasi-randomised trials of Dan Shen agents involving 494 patients with acute ischaemic stroke. There was no evidence that Dan Shen agents did more good than harm. There is not enough evidence to support the routine use of Dan Shen agents to promote recovery after stroke. Further high-quality, large-scale randomised controlled trials are needed to guide clinical practice.</P>
</SUMMARY_BODY>
</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Based mainly on experimental data that indicates improvement to the cerebral microcirculation, Dan Shen, a herbal medicine, is widely used in the treatment of acute ischaemic stroke in China.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To assess the effects of Dan Shen agents in patients with acute ischaemic stroke.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (last searched July 2006), the register of the Cochrane Complementary Field (last searched July 2006) and the Chinese Stroke Trials Register (last searched August 2006). In addition, we searched the following bibliographic databases: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (<I>The Cochrane Library</I>, Issue 2, 2006), MEDLINE (1996 to August 2006), EMBASE (1980 to August 2006), CINAHL (1982 to August 2006), AMED (1985 to August 2006), and the China Biological Medicine Database (CBM-disc) (1979 to August 2006). We handsearched 10 Chinese journals, searched clinical trials and research databases, scanned reference lists and contacted the pharmaceutical company manufacturing Dan Shen. We also attempted to contact trial authors to obtain further data.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing Dan Shen agents with placebo or open control in patients with acute ischaemic stroke.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Two review authors independently selected trials for inclusion, assessed trial quality, and extracted the data.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Six trials involving 494 patients were included. Three trials are awaiting assessment. Numbers of deaths and dependent patients at the end of follow up of at least three months were not reported in the six included trials. Only two trials reported adverse events. All trials measured the outcome 'significant improvement in neurological deficit at the end of treatment'. Dan Shen agents were associated with a significant increase in the number of patients with the outcome (Peto odds ratio 3.02, 95% confidence interval 1.73 to 5.26). No deaths were reported within the first two weeks of treatment or during the whole follow-up period. The trials did not include any assessment of quality of life.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>The methodological quality of all included studies was poor, and reliable conclusions could not be drawn from the present data. Further high-quality randomised controlled trials should be performed.</P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>

<BODY MODIFIED="2008-08-06 12:03:40 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Acute ischaemic stroke is a major cause of death and disability. Despite studying many drug therapies, there is as yet no routine effective, generally accepted, specific treatment for acute ischaemic stroke, except for aspirin (<LINK REF="REF-Horn-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Horn 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-IST-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">IST 1997</LINK>). Thrombolysis with tissue plasminogen activator is effective in highly selected patients (within three hours of stroke onset), but there is insufficient evidence to recommend the general application of this and other thrombolytic drugs for acute ischaemic stroke (<LINK REF="REF-Wardlaw-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wardlaw 2002</LINK>). Other strategies may improve the cerebral microcirculation. In China, acupuncture and many Chinese herbal medicines that may ameliorate the microcirculation are regularly given to patients suffering from acute ischaemic stroke, either in Western medicine hospitals or traditional Chinese medicine hospitals. Dan Shen agents are some of the most widely used drugs, particularly the Compound Dan Shen dropping pill, which was approved for testing in clinical trials by the USA Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1997 (<LINK REF="REF-Tianjin-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tianjin 1998</LINK>). Dan Shen agents appear to have few adverse effects and the cost of them is low. Therefore, if there is adequate evidence to confirm the effectiveness of Dan Shen agents, many patients with acute ischaemic stroke could benefit from this simple and cheap treatment in China and elsewhere in the world. </P>
<P>The main component of Dan Shen agents is Radix Salviae Miltiorrhizae. From 1934 to 1976, many studies of Dan Shen were carried out in China. Fifteen kinds of biologically active substances have been extracted (<LINK REF="REF-Liang-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liang 2000</LINK>), among which tanshinone, isotanshinone and hydroxytanshinone are the important ingredients. Pharmacological studies indicate that Dan Shen can be used for dilating the cardiocerebral vessels, suppressing the aggregation of platelets, improving circulation, removing blood stasis, protecting against ischaemic reperfusion injury, and enhancing the tolerance of ischaemic tissue to hypoxia (<LINK REF="REF-CMMCC-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">CMMCC 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Li-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Li 2000</LINK>). Dan Shen agents include Dan Shen tablet, Dan Shen injection, Compound Dan Shen tablet, Compound Dan Shen injection and Compound Dan Shen dropping pill. In addition to Dan Shen, Compound Dan Shen agents contain other Chinese herbal medicines (e.g. Ligni dalbergiae odoriferae, Sanqi, Bingpian) that can promote the curative effects and decrease the adverse effects of Dan Shen. Dan Shen agents were introduced into clinical practice for ischaemic stroke in 1970 in China (<LINK REF="REF-Jin-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jin 1978</LINK>). They are well accepted by Chinese doctors and are one of the most frequently used Chinese herbal medicines in the treatment of acute ischaemic stroke, heart disease and other systemic disorders (<LINK REF="REF-Li-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Li 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tianjin-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tianjin 1998</LINK>). One published systematic review of Compound Dan Shen injection for acute ischaemic stroke included only those trials in which the tested interventions were active Western or herbal medicines and Compound Dan Shen injection was used as the standard control treatment. It revealed that the effect of Compound Dan Shen injection was inferior to other medicines in five trials, and not significantly different from other drugs in another six trials in disability improvement (<LINK REF="REF-Sze-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sze 2005</LINK>). This study did not answer the question of whether Dan Shen is more effective than no Dan Shen. Moreover, it did not assess the efficacy of other Dan Shen agents. We are aware of some randomised controlled trials of Dan Shen agents for acute ischaemic stroke reported in China. However, there is uncertainty whether the existing evidence is scientifically rigorous and whether Dan Shen agents can be recommended for routine treatment.</P>
<P>The aim of this review is to analyse systematically all the randomised controlled trials of Dan Shen agents for acute ischaemic stroke to provide the best available evidence for clinical practice and further research planning for stroke treatment.<BR/> </P>

</OBJECTIVES>
<METHODS MODIFIED="2008-08-06 12:03:40 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<CRIT_STUDIES>
<P>We included randomised controlled trials or quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing Dan Shen agents with placebo or open control (no placebo) in patients with acute ischaemic stroke. Quasi-randomisation refers to allocation using alternation, the sequence of admission, case record numbers, dates of birth, or day of the week. Confounded trials, in which the treatment or control group received another active therapy (such as Dan Shen agents versus another drug), were excluded.</P>
</CRIT_STUDIES>
<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>Trials that included patients of any age or sex with acute ischaemic stroke (within 14 days of onset) were eligible. The clinical definition of ischaemic stroke is that of the World Health Organization criteria (<LINK REF="REF-Hatano-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hatano 1976</LINK>) with computerised tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanning to exclude haemorrhagic stroke. We diagnosed possible ischaemic stroke if CT or MRI was not performed. </P>
</CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>We included trials evaluating any type of Dan Shen agents (Dan Shen tablet, Dan Shen injection, Compound Dan Shen tablet, Compound Dan Shen injection, or Compound Dan Shen dropping pill) regardless of the length of treatment period and dosage of treatment. The control interventions were placebo or no treatment. We aimed to include trials where Dan Shen agents plus another treatment was compared with the other treatment alone. </P>
</CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<CRIT_OUTCOMES>
<P>Primary outcome measures included death or dependency at the end of long-term follow up (at least three months). Dependency was defined as dependent on others in activities of daily living, for example the Barthel Index scored 60 or less, or the modified Rankin Scale graded 3 to 5 (<LINK REF="REF-Sulter-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sulter 1999</LINK>), or the trialist's own definition.</P>
<P>Secondary outcome measures included the following.<BR/>(1) Adverse events: nausea, vomiting, allergic reaction, tachycardia, haemorrhagic transformation of the infarct caused by Dan Shen agents and some unexplained organ abnormalities (e.g. hepatic, haematological, cardiac, respiratory). The number of patients developing at least one adverse event listed above was evaluated.<BR/>(2) The proportion of patients with marked neurological improvement after treatment. The measures could focus on specific impairment (e.g. motor deficit or cognitive impairment) or global neurological deficit (e.g. the National Institute of Health Stroke Scale, Canadian Neurological Scale, European Stroke Scale, or the Scandinavian Stroke Scale, which involve motor, sensory and other impaired neurological function). <BR/>(3) Death from all causes (a) within the first two weeks of treatment, and (b) during the whole follow-up period.<BR/>(4) Quality of life if assessed by the included trials.</P>

<RESULTS MODIFIED="2008-08-06 11:52:32 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<P>We identified 460 references through electronic searches and handsearches. Of these, we excluded 449 irrelevant references. Eleven potentially eligible trials were identified, of which six trials (<LINK REF="STD-Cao-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Cao 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mao-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Mao 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Min-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Min 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pan-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Pan 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zhai-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Zhai 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zhang-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Zhang 2002</LINK>) were included (494 acute ischaemic stroke patients from 894 participants). Summary details of these trials are given in the 'Characteristics of included studies' table. Two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Geng-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Geng 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Xu-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Xu 1995</LINK>) were excluded because they were not randomised or quasi-randomised trials. Three trials (<LINK REF="STD-Gao-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Gao 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Liang-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Liang 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Luo-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Luo 1998</LINK>) are awaiting assessment because they have not reported the numbers of participants during the acute period of ischaemic stroke.</P>
<P>The six included trials were all conducted in China. The average age of participants in the included studies ranged from 56.4 to 76 years. Each trial included more males than females. </P>
<P>All six trials have the distinct inclusion criteria and the level of severity of acute ischaemic stroke patients. One trial reported the numbers of patients with severe stroke (<LINK REF="STD-Pan-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Pan 1992</LINK>).</P>
<P>Compound Dan Shen agents were studied in five included trials (<LINK REF="STD-Cao-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Cao 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mao-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Mao 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Min-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Min 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pan-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Pan 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zhang-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Zhang 2002</LINK>) and Dan Shen injection was evaluated on one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Zhai-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Zhai 2001</LINK>). Two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Cao-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Cao 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pan-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Pan 1992</LINK>) combined Compound Dan Shen injection with snake venom in the treatment group and used snake venom alone in the control group. The doses of snake venom and Compound Dan Shen injection were 0.5 U to 0.75 U and 20 ml (<LINK REF="STD-Cao-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Cao 1994</LINK>) and 0.25 U to 0.75 U and 20 ml (<LINK REF="STD-Pan-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Pan 1992</LINK>). The treatment period of Compound Dan Shen injection was 28 days (<LINK REF="STD-Cao-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Cao 1994</LINK>) and 21 days (<LINK REF="STD-Pan-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Pan 1992</LINK>). One trial (<LINK REF="STD-Zhang-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Zhang 2002</LINK>) combined Compound Dan Shen injection with low-molecular-weight heparin in the treatment group and used low-molecular-weight heparin alone in the control group. Compound Dan Shen injection was given 20 ml per day in the treatment group and with 5000 U low-molecular-weight heparin twice a day for seven days in each group. One trial (<LINK REF="STD-Min-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Min 2004</LINK>) used Compound Dan Shen injection 20 ml and basic treatment compared with basic treatment alone for 14 days. One trial (<LINK REF="STD-Zhai-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Zhai 2001</LINK>) compared Dan Shen injection and basic treatment with basic treatment alone for 14 days. Oral Compound Dan Shen dropping pill was used in one study (<LINK REF="STD-Mao-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Mao 2001</LINK>). It was administered three times daily, with a treatment length of 28 days. The timing of the start of treatment after stroke onset was not reported in any these trials.</P>
<P>The outcome measure used in four trials (<LINK REF="STD-Cao-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Cao 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mao-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Mao 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Min-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Min 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zhang-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Zhang 2002</LINK>) was the measurement of neurological deficit using the Modified Edinburgh-Scandinavian Stroke Scale (MESSS). Two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Pan-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Pan 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zhai-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Zhai 2001</LINK>) applied a measurement of neurological deficit that is similar to MESSS but defined by the trialists. </P>
<P>None of the participants in any of the trials were followed up after treatment was discontinued. No deaths were reported in these trials. Only two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Min-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Min 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zhang-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Zhang 2002</LINK>) reported adverse events.

<P>Two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Cao-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Cao 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zhang-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Zhang 2002</LINK>) had inadequate concealment of randomisation because they allocated participants according their sequence of admission. Three trials (<LINK REF="STD-Mao-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Mao 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pan-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Pan 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zhai-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Zhai 2001</LINK>) did not report the method of allocation and were graded as unclear allocation concealment. Only one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Min-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Min 2004</LINK>) had allocated participants by random number. Unfortunately, it did not describe whether allocation concealment was used or not. The baseline characteristics of the participants did not differ between groups in these trials. None of the trials stated whether they used a blinded method of outcome assessment and intention-to-treat analysis. No participants were lost to follow up, but the duration of follow up was short. </P>

<DISCUSSION>
<P>Dan Shen agents have been used in clinical practice in China for more than 30 years. Although there is no clear evidence on the efficacy of Dan Shen agents for acute ischaemic stroke, they are used widely in either Western medicine hospitals or traditional Chinese medicine hospitals in China. They have even been considered as standard treatment in clinical practice and used as a standard control intervention in clinical trials. This was not appropriate because there were no data supporting Dan Shen agents as a standard control treatment. Our aim was to analyse systematically all the randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing Dan Shen agents with no Dan Shen agents in patients with acute ischaemic stroke. The control could be either placebo or open control. Therefore, this systematic review was significantly different from the published review by Sze et al (<LINK REF="REF-Sze-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sze 2005</LINK>). </P>
<P>We identified eleven completed randomised controlled trials or quasi-randomised controlled trials of Dan Shen agents for acute ischaemic stroke, but only six trials, including 494 participants, had data available. Three trials are awaiting assessment because of the lack of available data (<LINK REF="STD-Gao-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Gao 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Liang-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Liang 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Luo-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Luo 1998</LINK>). Meta-analysis of the six included trials showed that Dan Shen agents may improve neurological impairment after acute ischaemic stroke, but this result should be interpreted with caution because of the poor methodological quality of the included trials and the small numbers of participants. Subgroup analysis showed no evidence of a difference in efficacy between compound Dan Shen dropping pill and Compound Dan Shen injection. In the subgroup analysis, all the included trials were of Dan Shen versus control; any analyses comparing different Dan Shen agents or different routes of administration are indirect comparisons. Indirect comparisons are more prone to bias than direct randomised comparisons; however, such comparisons can still be of value if this limitation is taken into account.</P>
<P>All the included trials were generally of poor quality. Firstly, we could not be sure that allocation was well concealed and truly random. Three trials (<LINK REF="STD-Mao-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Mao 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pan-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Pan 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zhai-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Zhai 2001</LINK>) did not mention the method of allocation and concealment. Two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Cao-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Cao 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zhang-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Zhang 2002</LINK>) were quasi-randomised controlled trials. Only one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Min-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Min 2004</LINK>) allocated patients by random number. Therefore, the concealment was not adequate. This could have led to selection bias. It has been reported that odds ratios are exaggerated by 41% for inadequately concealed trials and by 30% for unclearly concealed trials (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>). It is therefore plausible that Dan Shen is truly ineffective and the apparent benefits are simply due to bias arising from the methodological weaknesses of the studies. </P>
<P>Secondly, the duration of treatment ranged from 14 days to 28 days in these trials. The period of follow up was not enough to assess the long-term effect of Dan Shen agents. Five to six months after stroke seems an appropriate time point at which to measure neurological and functional outcome. Spontaneous recovery does not plateau until five to six months after stroke, especially in severe stroke (<LINK REF="REF-Duncan-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Duncan 2000</LINK>). The short follow up cannot confirm the long-term effect of the intervention.</P>
<P>Thirdly, outcome assessment can usually be blinded but whether these trials used a blinded method to assess outcome or not is unclear. It would have led to measurement bias if there was no attempt to do so. As a result, the effect of the intervention could have been either exaggerated or minimised.</P>
<P>Fourthly, primary outcome measures should be at the level of activities. All these trials were focused on the level of neurological deficit. Impairment outcome measures were the surrogate endpoint. The most important outcome for patients is their abilities in activities of daily living rather than their neurological deficits. We were concerned that none of the trials reported any deaths, since we could not assess whether there was differential mortality in the treatment groups which might have affected an assessment of impairment or disability in survivors. Hence, as recommended in the CONSORT statement (http://www.consort-statement.org/), all trials should account for all participants at the end of the study, including the number of deaths at the end of scheduled follow up. </P>
<P>Lastly, adverse effects are as important as the efficacy of the interventions in clinical trials. Only two trials reported adverse events in this review and they did not provide the numbers of participants presenting with these events in each group (<LINK REF="STD-Min-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Min 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zhang-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Zhang 2002</LINK>). We cannot draw a conclusion on the safety of Dan Shen agents because snake venom and low-molecular-weight heparin can also have an adverse action, such as thrombocytopenia. Therefore, Dan Shen agents may increase the risk of bleeding; this will only be adequately quantified within large-scale clinical trials.</P>
<P>A definite conclusion regarding the efficacy and adverse events associated with Dan Shen agents cannot be drawn from this review due to the limited number of trials identified, the limited duration of treatment, and inadequate recording and reporting of adverse events. High-quality, large-scale trials are needed to confirm the efficacy of Dan Shen agents. </P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>This review does not provide any evidence to support the routine use of Dan Shen agents for the treatment of patients with acute ischaemic stroke.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>This review suggests that Dan Shen agents may improve neurological impairment after acute ischaemic stroke. High-quality, large-scale randomised trials are needed to confirm or refute these results. Future trials should overcome the limitations of the trials presented in this review, in particular they should assure adequate concealment of allocation, blinding of outcome assessors, and use a functional outcome as the primary outcome measured at long-term follow up.</P>
