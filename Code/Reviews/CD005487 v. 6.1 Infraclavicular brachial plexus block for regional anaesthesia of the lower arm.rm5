<DESCRIPTION>
<P>This review is an update of the previous Cochrane systematic review (<LINK REF="REF-Chin-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chin 2010</LINK>) that included 15 randomized controlled trials (RCTs).</P>
<P>Two new authors, Sanjib Das Adhikary and Husni Alakkad, have replaced the previous authors Veerabadran Velayutham and Victor Chee in updating this version.</P>
<P>We identified 13 potential new papers, we included seven studies that met our inclusion criteria. We excluded two papers which were non-RCTs and two studies which did not examine the outcomes of interest in this review. Two additional studies were only published as abstracts and were not included or analysed as data and methodological details were lacking.</P>
<P>In general our review reaches the same primary conclusions as <LINK REF="REF-Chin-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chin 2010</LINK>. However the inclusion of more trials increased the precision of the estimates of the relative risk of inadequate surgical anaesthesia, and removed some of the slight differences in secondary outcomes and subgroup analyses that had been noted in the previous review (<LINK REF="REF-Chin-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chin 2010</LINK>), e.g. risk of requiring supplementation, risk of inadequate surgical anaesthesia in studies using weight-based local anaesthetic dosing. We also applied several additional sensitivity and subgroup analyses, which supported the overall results.</P>

<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2013-08-25 11:42:43 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Surgical anaesthesia of the lower arm, from the elbow to the hand, may be provided by injecting local anaesthetic around the brachial plexus (the bundle of nerves passing from the spinal cord in the neck to the arm, through the shoulder). There are several commonly-used techniques of blocking the brachial plexus but it is not clear which, if any, is the best. This updated systematic review compared the effects of blocking the brachial plexus by injecting local anaesthetic in the area below the collarbone (the infraclavicular block) with other techniques.</P>
<P>We searched the databases until June 2013, and included 22 studies involving 1732 patients of whom 842 had an infraclavicular block and 930 had brachial plexus blockade with another technique. These other techniques were axillary block (injection in the armpit area; 14 studies), supraclavicular block (injection in the area just above the collarbone; six studies), mid-humeral block (injection in the upper arm; two studies) and parascalene block (injection in the lower neck area; one study). One study compared an infraclavicular block with both an axillary block and a supraclavicular block. The infraclavicular block had a high success rate and was as good as all other blocks in providing anaesthesia of the lower arm. Advantages of the infraclavicular block included a reduced risk of pain from the tourniquet applied to the upper arm during surgery and a faster performance time (four minutes on average) compared to more complex techniques of axillary or mid-humeral block that used three or four separate injections (instead of just one). Side-effects were uncommon, and no difference was seen between the infraclavicular block and all other blocks in this regard.</P>
<P>In conclusion, this review showed that the infraclavicular block is an effective and safe choice for producing anaesthesia of the lower arm.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2013-08-25 07:58:02 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Several approaches exist to produce local anaesthetic blockade of the brachial plexus. It is not clear which is the technique of choice for providing surgical anaesthesia of the lower arm, although infraclavicular blockade (ICB) has several purported advantages. We therefore performed a systematic review of ICB compared to the other brachial plexus blocks (BPBs). This review was originally published in 2010 and was updated in 2013.</P>

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2013-08-25 08:01:07 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in <I>The Cochrane Library</I> (2013, Issue 5); MEDLINE (1966 to June 2013) via OvidSP; and EMBASE (1980 to June 2013) via OvidSP. We also searched conference proceedings (from 2004 to 2012) and the www.clinicaltrials.gov trials registry. The searches for the original review were performed in September 2008.</P>

<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2013-08-25 08:01:33 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>We included any randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared ICB with other BPBs as the sole anaesthetic technique for surgery on the lower arm.</P>

<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2009-11-29 10:17:32 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The primary outcome was adequate surgical anaesthesia within 30 minutes of block completion. Secondary outcomes included sensory block of individual nerves, tourniquet pain, onset time of sensory blockade, block performance time, block-associated pain and complications related to the block.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-08-25 08:15:20 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In our original review we included 15 studies with 1020 participants and excluded two. In this updated review we included seven new studies and excluded six, bringing the total number of included studies to 22 and involving 1732 participants. The control group intervention was the axillary block in 14 studies, supraclavicular block in six studies, mid-humeral block in two studies, and parascalene block in one study. One study compared ICB to both axillary and supraclavicular blocks. Nine studies employed ultrasound-guided ICB. The risk of failed surgical anaesthesia 30 minutes after block completion was similar for ICB and all other BPBs (11.4% versus 12.9%, risk ratio (RR) 0.88, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.52, P = 0.64), but tourniquet pain was less likely with ICB (11.9% versus 18.0%; RR of experiencing tourniquet pain 0.66, 95% CI 0.47 to 0.92, P = 0.02). Subgroup analysis by method of nerve localization, and by control group intervention, did not show any statistically significant differences in the risk of failed surgical anaesthesia. However when compared to a single-injection axillary block, ICB was better at providing complete sensory block of the musculocutaneous nerve (RR for failure 0.46, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.60, P &lt; 0.0001). ICB had a slightly longer sensory block onset time (mean difference (MD) 1.9 min, 95% CI 0.2 to 3.6, P = 0.03) but was faster to perform than multiple-injection axillary (MD -2.7 min, 95% CI -3.4 to -2.0, P &lt; 0.00001) or mid-humeral (MD -4.8 min, 95% CI -6.0 to -3.6, P &lt; 0.00001) blocks.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2013-02-03 00:23:00 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>ICB is as safe and effective as any other BPBs, regardless of whether ultrasound or neurostimulation guidance is used. The advantages of ICB include a lower likelihood of tourniquet pain during surgery, more reliable blockade of the musculocutaneous nerve when compared to a single-injection axillary block, and a significantly shorter block performance time compared to multi-injection axillary and mid-humeral blocks.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2013-08-25 08:39:44 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2013-08-25 08:23:22 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Surgical anaesthesia of the lower arm, from the elbow to the hand, may be readily achieved by injection of local anaesthetic around the brachial plexus (<LINK REF="REF-Cousins-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cousins 1998</LINK>). This regional anaesthesia technique avoids the need for a general anaesthetic and its accompanying risks (airway injuries, postoperative nausea and vomiting, postoperative drowsiness, etc). Control of postoperative pain is also excellent as the sensory block typically persists for several hours following injection.</P>
<P>The brachial plexus originates in the neck from the fifth to the eighth cervical nerve roots (C5 to C8) and the first thoracic nerve root (T1) then descends into the root of the neck and runs under the clavicle (collarbone) through the axilla (armpit) and down the arm. There are several techniques of brachial plexus blockade that can be used to provide anaesthesia for surgery of the lower arm. The brachial plexus may be approached with a needle at various sites along its course. These approaches include interscalene block (where the needle passes between the scalene muscles after piercing the skin in the front of the neck); supraclavicular block (where the skin is pierced lower and more laterally in the root of the neck above the clavicle); infraclavicular block (where the skin is pierced in the area below the clavicle); axillary block (where the skin is pierced in the axilla) and mid-humeral block (where the skin is pierced in the upper arm). The choice of which technique to use depends upon the practitioner's preference, but also upon the perceived efficacy and safety of each technique.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2013-08-25 08:28:12 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The infraclavicular block targets the brachial plexus in the infraclavicular space, which is pyramidal shaped and contains the brachial plexus, subclavian-axillary artery and vein, and lymph nodes and loose fatty tissue. The apex is a triangular surface formed by the confluence of the clavicle, scapula and first rib; the base is the skin and subcutaneous tissue of the armpit. Together with their investing fasciae, the posterior wall is formed by the scapula and its associated muscles; and the anterior wall by the pectoralis major and minor. The humerus, and the converging muscles and tendons of the anterior and posterior walls that insert into it, constitute the lateral wall. The bony thoracic cage with its overlying layer of serratus anterior muscle and fascia forms the medial wall. At the level of the infraclavicular space the brachial plexus is organized as three cords (lateral, medial and posterior) surrounding the axillary artery. None of the major terminal branches arise at this level.</P>
<P>The first description of a neurostimulation-guided infraclavicular block was by Raj and colleagues (<LINK REF="REF-Raj-1973" TYPE="REFERENCE">Raj 1973</LINK>) in 1973. Whiffler (<LINK REF="REF-Whiffler-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Whiffler 1981</LINK>) followed in 1981 with his description of the technique using the coracoid process as the chief surface landmark, but it was not until Kilka and colleagues (<LINK REF="REF-Kilka-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kilka 1995</LINK>) described their vertical infraclavicular plexus block in 1995 that interest in the infraclavicular approach really blossomed. Since then several other variants of the neurostimulation-guided infraclavicular block, using slightly different surface landmarks, have been described and adopted into clinical practice (<LINK REF="REF-Borgeat-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Borgeat 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jandard-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jandard 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kapral-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kapral 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kapral-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Kapral 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Minville-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Minville 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Salazar-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Salazar 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wilson-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wilson 1998</LINK>). Most recently, ultrasound-guided techniques of infraclavicular block (<LINK REF="REF-Dingemans-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dingemans 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sandhu-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sandhu 2006</LINK>) in which the axillary artery and surrounding brachial plexus are directly visualized using ultrasound have become popular. By allowing direct visualization of the needle tip, target nerves and the spread of local anaesthetic as it is injected ultrasound can increase the efficacy of the block (<LINK REF="REF-McCartney-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">McCartney 2010</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2013-08-25 08:30:13 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The purported advantages of infraclavicular block are as follows. First, it provides comprehensive anaesthesia of the upper limb as it blocks the brachial plexus where the three cords run close together in a neurovascular bundle with the axillary artery. The axillary block often fails to block the axillary nerve and musculocutaneous nerves (which have usually branched off at this level) whilst the interscalene and supraclavicular approaches may often fail to provide anaesthesia in the distribution of the ulnar nerve (<LINK REF="REF-Cousins-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cousins 1998</LINK>). There also appears to be a lower incidence of tourniquet pain with the infraclavicular block, which is attributed to spread to the intercostobrachial nerve that runs close to the brachial plexus in the infraclavicular space (<LINK REF="REF-Desroches-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Desroches 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sandhu-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sandhu 2006</LINK>). Secondly, the risk of inadvertent lung or pleural puncture is lower than with the interscalene and supraclavicular approaches (<LINK REF="REF-Cousins-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cousins 1998</LINK>) as the lung does not lie in the path of the needle. Thirdly, by piercing the skin below the clavicle, injury to the other neurovascular structures in the neck are avoided (unlike with the interscalene or supraclavicular approaches). Fourthly, infraclavicular block does not require abduction of the arm at the shoulder and can be performed in any arm position. Finally, it is an ideal site for inserting a catheter for continuous infusion of local anaesthetic. The bulk of the pectoralis muscle firmly anchors the catheter, arm movement is not impaired and hygiene is easily maintained (<LINK REF="REF-Brown-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brown 1993</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2013-08-25 08:39:44 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There are several techniques of brachial plexus blockade that can be used to provide anaesthesia for surgery of the lower arm. Given the advantages listed above, the infraclavicular block may be the technique of choice. We sought to establish if this was indeed the case by performing a systematic review of the efficacy and safety of infraclavicular block as compared to other approaches to block the brachial plexus for regional anaesthesia. Our original review (<LINK REF="REF-Chin-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chin 2010</LINK>) found that the infraclavicular block was as effective as all other techniques of brachial plexus blockade with the advantages of being faster to perform, and less tourniquet pain. At the time, there were insufficient data to conclude if these findings applied to ultrasound-guided approaches as well. Since then, there has been a large amount of research conducted into ultrasound-guided peripheral nerve blocks.</P>

<P>In this update, two authors assessed risk of bias for previously and newly-included trials using the tool outlined in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Intervention</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). The seven criteria used are listed below. For each criterion, 'Low' indicates a low risk of bias, 'High' represents a high risk of bias, and 'Unclear' indicates that there was insufficient information to make a judgement of the degree of risk of bias. Disagreements were resolved by discussion and consensus.</P>

We did not report a pooled meta-analysis of all studies because of the significant statistical and clinical heterogeneity amongst the comparator block techniques.

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-08-25 12:31:40 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Infraclavicular block (ICB) is as effective as other techniques of brachial plexus blockade for providing surgical anaesthesia of the lower arm (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>), with an average success rate of 88% in the studies included in this review (<LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>). Subgroup analysis by method of nerve localization (ultrasound or neurostimulation) and by the different comparator block techniques did not show a significant difference in anaesthetic efficacy, with one possible exception. The ICB may be a superior technique compared to the single-injection axillary block; as there was a significantly lower risk of requiring general anaesthesia and of failing to achieve sensory block of the musculocutaneous nerve with ICB. The latter observation is not surprising given that the musculocutaneous nerve has usually separated from the brachial plexus in the axilla and is therefore prone to being missed unless it is deliberately sought out with an additional injection with axillary block.</P>
<P>In the first version of this review, we observed a slightly higher risk of requiring supplementation of surgical anaesthesia following an ICB compared to other blocks, and we suggested that one reason could be a slower onset time of sensory block. In the current update, there was no difference in the risk of requiring supplementation (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>). Our best estimate of the mean difference in onset time between an ICB and all other blocks, while still statistically significant, has also decreased from 3.9 to 1.9 minutes (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>), and is now of little clinical significance. Six out of seven of the new studies identified and included in this update utilized an ultrasound-guided technique of ICB, and it is likely that the increased accuracy of local anaesthetic injection around the brachial plexus afforded by ultrasound contributed to both of these outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-McCartney-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">McCartney 2010</LINK>). This is supported by the subgroup analysis of ultrasound-guided ICB, which showed no significant difference in onset time between ICB and all other blocks.</P>
<P>The first version of the review also found that surgical anaesthesia was significantly less likely following ICB in the subgroup of studies that used variable weight-based local anaesthetic volumes of less than 40 ml. We postulated that this was because the cords of the brachial plexus are dispersed around the axillary artery in the infraclavicular region and thus an adequate volume is important in ensuring complete local anaesthetic spread. In the current update, there was no difference in the incidence of surgical anaesthesia in the subgroup of studies using weight-based dosing or local anaesthetic volumes less than 40 ml. Once again, this change may be due to the increased accuracy of the ultrasound-guided technique of ICB.</P>
<P>One advantage of the ICB over other brachial plexus blocks is a decreased risk of tourniquet pain, which in turn may reduce the need for additional intraoperative sedatives or analgesics (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>). The decrease in tourniquet pain has been attributed to local anaesthetic spread to the intercostobrachial nerve. This arises from the second thoracic nerve root and runs through the axilla in close proximity to the axillary vein and infraclavicular space to supply part of the medial surface of the upper arm (<LINK REF="REF-Sandhu-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sandhu 2006</LINK>). The ICB was also faster to perform than the multiple-injection techniques of axillary block and mid-humeral block, by an average time difference of three and five minutes respectively (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>). This advantage is slightly offset by the increased sensory block onset time observed with ICB.</P>
<P>The overall complication rate of the ICB was low and no different from that observed with the other blocks. In particular, there were no reported cases of pneumothorax. The risk of Horner's syndrome was also significantly reduced with the ICB approach. The proximity of the axillary artery and vein to the brachial plexus accounts for the fact that vascular puncture was the most commonly observed complication of ICB. This is a consideration in patients with coagulation abnormalities as the relatively deeper location of the axillary vessels in the infraclavicular region may make it harder to achieve haemostasis by compression.</P>

<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2013-08-25 12:33:06 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This update includes 22 studies and 1732 participants in total. Six studies (514 participants) compared ICB to supraclavicular block, and six studies (617 participants) compared the ICB to a multiple-injection axillary block technique. Analysis of both these subgroups showed no significant differences in surgical anaesthesia. Since the late 2000s, the trend in peripheral nerve block techniques and regional anaesthesia has been to use ultrasound guidance rather than surface landmarks or neurostimulation to locate nerves (<LINK REF="REF-Chin-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chin 2008</LINK>). Nine out of the 22 studies (894 participants) utilized ultrasound-guided ICB, and seven of these studies compared it to another ultrasound-guided brachial plexus block (supraclavicular or axillary). Subgroup analysis by method of nerve localization (ultrasound-guided or neurostimulation-guided) did not show a significant difference between ICB and other brachial plexus blocks in either group. We therefore believe that this review is a valid representation of the available evidence addressing the question of which brachial plexus block is most suited to regional anaesthesia of the lower arm, and that the findings are applicable to current practice.</P>

<P>The majority of the studies were methodologically sound with overall low risk of bias. The commonest reason for unclear risk of bias was insufficient detail regarding random sequence generation (10 studies) and allocation concealment (13 studies). Ten studies did not explicitly describe blinding of the outcome assessor. The most significant methodological limitation that was identified was performance bias. In two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Frederiksen-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Frederiksen 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Koscielniak_x002d_N-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Koscielniak-N 2009</LINK>) the investigators stated that the ICB was the preferred approach to the brachial plexus at their institution, and that this may have influenced study outcomes in favour of the ICB. In another study (<LINK REF="STD-De-Jose-Maria-2008" TYPE="STUDY">De Jose Maria 2008</LINK>) the technique of ICB used may have been suboptimal, contributing to a perceived higher failure rate of ICB. A sensitivity analysis showed, however, that there was still no difference between ICB and other brachial plexus blocks with respect to the primary outcome of adequate surgical anaesthesia when these three studies were excluded.</P>

<LINK REF="REF-Tran-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tran 2007</LINK> reviewed the evidence from randomized controlled trials regarding the optimal approaches and techniques for brachial plexus blockade. They identified nine studies that compared ICB with either supraclavicular block, axillary block, or mid-humeral block. The conclusions of their narrative review were consistent with the findings of this review, namely that the anaesthetic efficacy of ICB is similar to that of supraclavicular block and multiple-injection axillary or mid-humeral block, but is superior to that of a single-injection axillary block. In another narrative review restricted to ultrasound-guided brachial plexus blocks, <LINK REF="REF-McCartney-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">McCartney 2010</LINK> identified only four studies that compared ICB to supraclavicular block and concluded that there was insufficient evidence to make a definitive recommendation on the relative efficacy and adverse effects of the two techniques.</P>

<P>Infraclavicular block is an excellent choice for providing surgical anaesthesia of the lower arm. It is as safe and effective as any other technique of brachial plexus block, regardless of whether ultrasound or neurostimulation guidance is used. It is also more effective at preventing tourniquet pain. At the same time, the infraclavicular block is faster to perform than the more complex multiple-injection techniques of axillary block and mid-humeral block that target individual nerves. A possible influence of local anaesthetic volume and block onset time on efficacy of the infraclavicular block was observed in the original review; this is no longer apparent in this update, and is likely to be due to the increased accuracy of injection with ultrasound guidance.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2013-08-25 12:41:36 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Ultrasound guidance has largely replaced neurostimulation in modern brachial plexus blockade, and has improved the efficacy of all the commonly-used techniques. Given the high success rates reported in recent studies, it is unlikely that additional comparative trials will lead to a demonstration of a difference in efficacy between the various techniques. Going forward, it is our opinion that learning curves, ease of block performance, and adverse effects will be the key factors that determine an individual practitioner's choice of which brachial plexus block to perform. We therefore recommend that future research should focus on these areas.</P>

<P>1. Author list</P>
<P>1.1 Bernard Lee removed from author list.</P>
<P>2. Inclusion criteria <U>(</U>
<LINK TAG="SELECTION_CRITERIA" TYPE="SECTION">Criteria for considering studies for this review</LINK>)</P>
<P>2.1 The protocol originally stated that we would exclude patients having a planned combined regional and general anaesthetic, as we assumed that the efficacy of the regional anaesthetic could not be assessed in this case. However upon reviewing identified studies it became apparent that the methodology in some trials that utilized a combined technique did in fact permit assessment of the efficacy of the brachial plexus block. The inclusion criteria (<LINK TAG="CRIT_PARTICIPANTS" TYPE="SECTION">Types of participants</LINK>) in the review were modified to reflect this.</P>
<P>3. <LINK TAG="CRIT_OUTCOMES" TYPE="SECTION">Types of outcome measures</LINK>
</P>
<P>3.1 The term "Proportion of patients..." or "Number of patients.." was used in several of the outcome definitions in the protocol. This term was removed in the review to avoid confusion as to whether the outcome was a dichotomous or continuous variable.</P>
<P>3.2 "Onset time of adequate surgical anaesthesia" was redefined as "onset time of sensory block" as this was the endpoint used in studies that examined onset times.</P>
<P>3.3 We added two additional secondary efficacy outcome measures to the review as they were reported in several studies and are of clinical relevance. They are as follows.</P>
<P>3.3.1 Block performance time.</P>
<P>3.3.2 Complete sensory block in individual nerve territories at 30 minutes post-injection.</P>
<P>3.4 The outcome "Proportion of patients complaining of pain during performance of the block" was moved to the subheading of "Secondary outcome measures (safety and comfort)" and was revised to read "Pain associated with block performance". This was done because, upon reviewing studies, it became apparent that all investigators who looked at block-associated pain reported pain scores and not the number of patients spontaneously complaining of pain.</P>
<P>3.5 The outcomes of pneumothorax, vascular puncture, Horner's syndrome, persistent neurological complications, and systemic complications were combined into a single outcome 'Complications' in order to simplify the review and data analysis presentation. The individual complications were assessed in a subgroup analysis.</P>

<P>Quote: &#8220;The infraclavicular approach is our standard technique for hand/forearm surgery, although the AX block is more often used in arthritic, obese or muscular patients. We teach our residents the IC block as the primary approach. Most blocks in this study were performed by the residents, although the number of AX blocks performed by the residents in this study is lower than the number of IC blocks. Their limited experience with the axillary approach might have affected the performance times and numbers of needle passes. All incomplete AX blocks occurred among the &#64257;rst half of the patients included, which supports this speculation&#8221;</P>

<P>Quote: &#8220;We speculate that the poorer ef&#64257;cacy of the supraclavicular blocks in our patients was caused by lower experience with this approach and a higher number of colleagues performing the block. Our standard blocking technique for hand and/or forearm surgery is infraclavicular, although obese patients mostly receive supraclavicular or axillary blocks. Although staff anaesthesiologists listed as authors were skilled in both approaches, the infraclavicular approach is better known by other colleagues and the residents who carried out the blocks under supervision.&#8221;</P>
