<P>
<I>Streptococcus pneumoniae</I> (<I>S. pneumoniae</I>)<I> </I>is responsible for a considerable burden of illness and death in adults worldwide, usually from pneumonia and less often from invasive pneumococcal disease. Vaccination (using pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccines) might reduce such illness and death. This updated review included 18 randomised controlled trials involving 64,901 participants and seven non-randomised controlled trials involving 62,294 participants (the latter contributing outcomes for culture-confirmed invasive pneumococcal disease only).</P>
<P>We found consistently strong evidence that the vaccine is effective in preventing the rarer outcome of invasive pneumococcal disease. Evidence from the included studies indicates vaccination might not afford as much protection in adults with chronic illness as it does for healthy adults. The available evidence does not demonstrate that pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccines prevent pneumonia (of all causes) or mortality in adults. This review did not consider adverse events as it was outside the scope of the study.</P>

<P>Twenty-five studies met our inclusion criteria (18 RCTs involving 64,852 participants and seven non-RCTs involving 62,294 participants). Meta-analysis of the RCTs found strong evidence of PPV efficacy against IPD with no statistical heterogeneity (OR 0.26, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.45; random-effects model, I<SUP>2 </SUP>statistic = 0%). There was efficacy against all-cause pneumonia in low-income (OR 0.54, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.67, I<SUP>2 </SUP>statistic = 19%) but not high-income countries in either the general population (OR 0.71, 95% CI 0.45 to 1.12, I<SUP>2 </SUP>statistic = 93%) or in adults with chronic illness (OR 0.93, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.19, I<SUP>2 </SUP>statistic = 10%). PPV was not associated with substantial reductions in all-cause mortality (OR 0.90, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.09; random-effects model, I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic = 69%). Vaccine efficacy against primary outcomes appeared poorer in adults with chronic illness. Non-RCTs provided evidence for protection against IPD in populations for whom the vaccine is currently utilised (OR 0.48, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.61; random-effects model, I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic = 31%).

<P>This meta-analysis provides evidence supporting the recommendation for PPV to prevent IPD in adults. The evidence from RCTs is less clear with respect to adults with chronic illness.

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2012-11-14 00:04:22 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Pneumococcal pneumonia and other diseases caused by <I>Streptococcus pneumoniae</I> (<I>S. pneumoniae</I>) continue to cause substantial morbidity and mortality throughout the world. Pneumonia is the most common presentation of pneumococcal disease in adults. Bacteraemic pneumonia is the most common cause of invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD), accounting for 90% of all cases (<LINK REF="REF-Fedson-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fedson 2004</LINK>). Mortality associated with invasive pneumococcal pneumonia in adults has remained unchanged at about 20% over the past 60 years (<LINK REF="REF-Austrian-1964" TYPE="REFERENCE">Austrian 1964</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Harboe-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harboe 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rello-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rello 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>Studies on the epidemiology of pneumococcal disease in high-income countries indicate that the highest incidence of disease is among the very young and the elderly (<LINK REF="REF-Butler-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Butler 2004</LINK>). However, some populations experience an increased disease incidence at a young adult age, such as Australian Indigenous persons aged 15 to 49 years, where the incidence of IPD is 10 times greater than the rate in non-Indigenous population (<LINK REF="REF-Menzies-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Menzies 2004</LINK>). The epidemiology of pneumococcal disease in adults in low-income countries has not been well described but the global burden of pneumonia in adults is likely to be significantly underestimated (<LINK REF="REF-Mulholland-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mulholland 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>The continuing burden of pneumococcal disease is worsened by increasing numbers of people with chronic disease or HIV infection and an ageing population in many high-income countries. Antibiotic resistance continues to present a major threat to the successful treatment of infections (<LINK REF="REF-Reacher-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reacher 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tomasz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tomasz 1995</LINK>). In low-income countries large numbers of people lack access to basic curative health care but might be reached by vaccination programmes.</P>
<P>Several population groups are at elevated risk of pneumococcal disease. Individuals with chronic disease (chronic lung disease, sickle cell anaemia, asplenic patients) or other conditions associated with a compromised immune status have been shown to have increased susceptibility to disease (<LINK REF="REF-Butler-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Butler 2004</LINK>). Other populations are at elevated risk due to environmental conditions, including overcrowding, exposure to air pollutants such as smoke and differences in serotype distribution (<LINK REF="REF-Butler-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Butler 2004</LINK>). It is unknown whether the higher rates of IPD in older adults in high-income countries is due to changes in the immune system, or the presence of underlying disease. A recent Cochrane Review (<LINK REF="REF-Walters-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walters 2010</LINK>) failed to show any protective efficacy of pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPV) in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, with seven trials included in the meta-analysis.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2012-11-20 08:46:29 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The search for a vaccine to protect against pneumococcal disease began with the first whole cell vaccine trial involving miners in South Africa, in 1911 (<LINK REF="REF-Wright-1914" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wright 1914</LINK>). Following MacLeod's trial of a four-valent PPV on military recruits in 1944 to 1945 (<LINK REF="STD-MacLeod-1945" TYPE="STUDY">MacLeod 1945</LINK>), a six-valent PPV became available for a short period, from 1946 to 1948 but was withdrawn following the increased use of penicillin. The continued high burden and severity of pneumococcal disease (despite the availability of antibiotics), has led to renewed calls for vaccine development and use. Trials of a six-valent PPV and a 13-valent PPV among South African gold miners (<LINK REF="STD-Austrian-1976a" TYPE="STUDY">Austrian 1976a</LINK>) and a 14-valent PPV trial in Papua New Guinean highlanders (<LINK REF="STD-Riley-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Riley 1977</LINK>), showed strong vaccine efficacy against bacteraemic pneumonia. Where specified, these vaccines contained 50 µG of each purified capsular polysaccharide. A 14-valent PPV was licensed for use in the United States in 1977; in 1983 this was replaced by a 23-valent formulation, containing a reduced 25 µG of each purified capsular polysaccharide, without additional pre-licensure trials.</P>
<P>Nasopharyngeal pneumococcal colonisation plays an essential role in the disease process. It is also recognised for its value in measuring the potential benefits (or harms) of vaccination, including direct effects on immunised individuals as well as indirect effects via transmission between immunised and non-immunised individuals (herd effects). Changes in nasopharyngeal carriage in response to pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) indicate a reduction in carriage of vaccine serotypes in immunised individuals and, importantly, a reduction in transmission to the non-immunised population. These herd effects are reflected in significant reductions in rates of vaccine serotype invasive disease in the non-immunised population (<LINK REF="REF-Whitney-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Whitney 2003</LINK>). Conversely, replacement of vaccine serotypes by carriage with serotypes not included in the vaccine has been documented in both vaccinated and non-vaccinated individuals and has been variously reflected in rates of disease caused by non-vaccine serotypes (<LINK REF="REF-Whitney-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Whitney 2003</LINK>). In contrast to PCV, herd effects of PPV have been poorly described, possibly because the required threshold of vaccine coverage has not been achieved in any studied population. There is a general consensus that PPV does not confer protection against carriage (<LINK REF="REF-Makela-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Makela 2004</LINK>). In view of the herd effects of PCV and in order to establish any evidence for this assumed consensus, we added this additional outcome to the meta-analysis when the protocol was amended for the previous Cochrane Review (<LINK REF="REF-Moberley-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moberley 2008</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2012-06-04 10:18:48 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Prior to the discovery of antibiotics, anti-sera to the polysaccharide capsule was the most effective therapy for pneumococcal pneumonia, reducing mortality to 5% if administered within 24 hours of the onset of symptoms (<LINK REF="REF-Casadevall-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Casadevall 1994</LINK>). The discovery of differences in the structure of the polysaccharide capsule (serotypes) and the need for anti-pneumococcal sera to be specific to each capsular serotype, led to the belief that the most effective protection against pneumococcal disease was opsonisation of the polysaccharide coat with antibody. There are over 90 different serotypes of <I>S. pneumonia</I>e; some are highly invasive, whereas others rarely cause disease. In addition, there is variation in the serotype distribution between age groups and across different geographical populations (<LINK REF="REF-Fedson-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fedson 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>Although there is no known immunological correlate of protection against pneumococcal disease, several groups (with some chronic illnesses, immunocompromised conditions and older adults) have been identified as either poor responders to all or some of the pneumococcal polysaccharide serotypes contained within the vaccine. Differences in the immunogenicity of 23-valent PPV have also been noted across population groups (<LINK REF="REF-McMahon-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">McMahon 1993</LINK>) with genetic factors also thought to influence antibody responses to the pneumococcal capsular polysaccharides (<LINK REF="REF-Pandey-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pandey 2000</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2012-08-07 11:56:18 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The 23-valent PPV has been utilised internationally to varying extents but mainly limited to older adults and adults with medical risk factors for IPD in high-income countries (<LINK REF="REF-Fedson-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fedson 1998</LINK>). This review updates the previous Cochrane Review (<LINK REF="REF-Moberley-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moberley 2008</LINK>) and addresses whether PPV is effective in all adult populations or whether only some groups benefit.</P>

<P>For the analysis of RCTs, we summarised vaccine efficacy as odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We used random-effects models. We examined publication bias using funnel plots. For the analysis of non-RCTs, we summarised effectiveness following the conversion of each study outcome to a log OR and standard error (SE). We used random-effects models. We conducted analyses using <LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2011</LINK>. Where results were also presented as estimates of vaccine effectiveness, this has been calculated as 100 (1 - pooled OR). This formula has also been used for the RCT component of the review, as an approximation for vaccine efficacy, as the risk of the included outcomes is so low. The rationale for using OR was based on the inclusion of non-randomised studies (such as matched case-control studies), where a simple comparison of the number of cases in vaccinated compared to unvaccinated is invalid.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">A. RCTs</HEADING>
<P>The RCTs included in the meta-analysis were conducted among diverse population groups, which we have classified into three subgroups. Firstly, otherwise healthy adults from low-income countries; this group consisted of African mine workers (<LINK REF="STD-Austrian-1976a" TYPE="STUDY">Austrian 1976a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Smit-1977a" TYPE="STUDY">Smit 1977a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Smit-1977b" TYPE="STUDY">Smit 1977b</LINK>) and community-dwelling adults residing in the highlands of Papua New Guinea (<LINK REF="STD-Riley-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Riley 1977</LINK>), considered to have been at elevated risk of disease due to overcrowding and environmental factors. These studies were conducted with vaccines containing six to 14 pneumococcal polysaccharide serotypes.</P>
<P>The second group were those populations that were considered to be at elevated risk of pneumococcal disease due to underlying medical illnesses such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (<LINK REF="STD-Alfageme-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Alfageme 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Davis-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Davis 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Furomoto-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Furomoto 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kawakami-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Kawakami 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Leech-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Leech 1987</LINK>) or patients with bronchogenic carcinoma (<LINK REF="STD-Klastersky-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Klastersky 1986</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Simberkoff-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Simberkoff 1986</LINK> recruited participants on the basis of age (&gt; 55 years) and the presence of underlying chronic illness. Given the number of deaths in both participant groups, this group was considered very high risk. Collectively, these studies utilised either the 14-valent or 23-valent PPVs in developed country settings: Spain, USA, Canada, Belgium, Japan and Denmark.</P>
<P>The third population group of the included RCTs were participants in high-income countries who were not recruited on the basis of underlying disease. These studies were conducted with vaccines containing two to 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide serotypes. The studies included participants at elevated risk of pneumococcal disease due to their age and place of residence; institution-based in New York (<LINK REF="STD-Kaufman-1947" TYPE="STUDY">Kaufman 1947</LINK>), hospices or retirements homes (<LINK REF="STD-Gaillat-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Gaillat 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Maruyama-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Maruyama 2010</LINK>); older adults aged 50 to 85 years with previous hospital admission for community-acquired pneumonia in Sweden (<LINK REF="STD-Ortqvist-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Ortqvist 1998</LINK>); and community-based older adults in Finland (<LINK REF="STD-Koivula-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Koivula 1997</LINK>). The two other trials were conducted in the United States among participants whose ages were not specified: adult inpatients were recruited from a psychiatric hospital (<LINK REF="STD-Austrian-1980a" TYPE="STUDY">Austrian 1980a</LINK>); and adults members were recruited from the Kaiser Permanente Health Plan (<LINK REF="STD-Austrian-1980b" TYPE="STUDY">Austrian 1980b</LINK>).</P>
<P>The most commonly reported outcome from the RCTs was all-cause radiologically confirmed pneumonia (16 studies) followed by all-cause mortality (14 studies) and IPD (11 studies). Five studies reported on vaccine-type IPD and four studies reported outcomes on vaccine-type definitive pneumonia. Mortality due to pneumonia was reported in nine studies and pneumococcal-specific mortality was reported in four studies. Pneumococcal nasopharyngeal colonisation was an outcome in two of the included studies but could not be included in this review due to incomplete reporting.</P>

<P>Five case-control studies and two large cohort studies were included in the meta-analysis of non-RCTs. They considered the 14-valent and 23-valent PPVs.</P>
<P>Three case-control studies that were set in the United States included participants aged from 18 years with medical conditions that placed them at higher risk of pneumococcal disease, or participants who were above 65 years of age (<LINK REF="STD-Benin-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Benin 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shapiro-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Shapiro 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shapiro-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Shapiro 1991</LINK>). The other two case-control studies related only to older adults: <LINK REF="STD-Sims-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Sims 1988</LINK> recruited immunocompetent adults from 55 years of age (United States); and <LINK REF="STD-Dominguez-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Dominguez 2005</LINK> included older adults from 65 years of age (Spain).

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2012-11-14 00:04:22 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In this review we aimed to determine the efficacy/effectiveness of the pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPV), a vaccine that in its current format has been licensed for nearly 30 years in adults. Given that most large randomised controlled trials (RCTs) had been conducted in populations with significant differences in disease susceptibility and serotype distribution, the clinical relevance to adult populations today appears to be uncertain. Nevertheless, we have attempted to define clinically relevant primary outcomes and conducted analysis in distinct population groups that are likely to differ in disease susceptibility and disease exposure.</P>
<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-11-14 00:04:22 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD)</HEADING>
<P>This meta-analysis demonstrates strong evidence of protection against IPD, with a correlate of efficacy from the RCTs of 74% (95% confidence interval (CI) 56% to 85%). This result remained robust in sensitivity analyses based on trial quality and influenza vaccine use.</P>
<P>Although there was no statistical heterogeneity when all RCTs were considered, there was a statistical difference (P &lt; 0.01) between the heterogeneity of the studies conducted among different population groups (otherwise healthy adults in low-income countries, adults with chronic illness in high-income countries and otherwise healthy adults in high-income countries). This indicates that the estimate of efficacy generated from pooling all of the studies is not representative for each of these population groups. In particular, vaccine efficacy amongst the subgroup of adults with chronic disease appears poor in comparison to that of otherwise healthy adults, in developed or low-income countries. Whilst there was insufficient power to demonstrate protective efficacy among the subgroup of adults with chronic disease, it should be noted that the disease risk amongst the control group was 124 per 100,000 population (2/1619). This is within the general estimate of IPD for older adults (50 cases per 100,000 population) (<LINK REF="REF-Fedson-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fedson 1999</LINK>) and indicates these studies are underpowered due to the number of participants recruited rather than low disease incidence. Evidence for vaccine effectiveness against IPD in this subgroup population is considered in the non-RCTs.</P>
<P>The inclusion of non-RCTs in this meta-analysis provides a valuable contribution to the understanding of the effectiveness of the PPV, used more recently in large population groups for whom the vaccine is currently recommended. The meta-analysis of the non-RCTs demonstrated protective effectiveness against IPD with a pooled estimate corresponding to a slightly lower measure of vaccine effectiveness of 52% (95% CI 37% to 61%) for all serotypes and 55% (95% CI 38% to 54%) for vaccine-type disease.</P>
<P>Effectiveness among both immunocompetent adults and immunocompetent older adults was also shown, with a non-significantly higher estimate of effectiveness of 59% for all serotypes (95% CI 48% to 68%). We assessed case-control studies separately from cohort studies and showed that the estimate of effectiveness from pooled case-control studies, at 53% (95% CI 32% to 68%), was not dissimilar to that obtained from the two large cohort studies (43%, 95% CI 11% to 64%).</P>
<P>The case-control studies had similar estimates for vaccine effectiveness (70%, 67% and 70%) with the exception of the <LINK REF="STD-Benin-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Benin 2003</LINK> study among Navajo adults. <LINK REF="STD-Benin-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Benin 2003</LINK>, involving persons aged from 18 years who had a medical condition that placed them at higher risk of pneumococcal disease, or others from age 65 years, found vaccine effectiveness of only 27%. The inferior estimate of effectiveness among Navajo adults may be due to population characteristics. It was reported that 75% of cases and 78% of controls were assigned as risk level 2 (alcoholism, diabetes, chronic cardiac, lung, renal and liver disease). This is higher than the equivalent disease risk ratings of the other case-control studies. Alcoholism in particular is very prevalent in participants in the <LINK REF="STD-Benin-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Benin 2003</LINK> study (43% and 45% of cases and controls), which has been associated with poor vaccine immunogenicity (<LINK REF="STD-Butler-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Butler 1993</LINK>) and vaccine failures (<LINK REF="REF-Hanna-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hanna 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McMahon-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">McMahon 1993</LINK>).</P>
<P>Both the <LINK REF="STD-Jackson-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Jackson 2003</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Vila_x002d_Corcoles-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Vila-Corcoles 2006</LINK> cohort studies report very similar multivariate adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) for all-type IPD of 0.56 (95% CI 0.33 to 0.93) and 0.60 (95% CI 0.22 to 1.65) respectively. Both studies adjusted for receipt of influenza vaccination.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">All-cause pneumonia</HEADING>
<P>All-cause pneumonia was the most reported outcome in this review with data from 16 RCTs. The pooled estimate of vaccine efficacy was 28% (95% CI 7% to 44%) but there was substantial variability in the effect estimate due to heterogeneity (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 85%, P &lt; 0.0001). Given the substantial proportion of variability due to heterogeneity, the available evidence does not demonstrate that PPVs prevent all-cause pneumonia in adults.</P>
<P>In contrast, we did find evidence of benefit against all-cause pneumonia among otherwise healthy adults in low-income countries (subgroup analysis). Here the pooled estimate of vaccine efficacy was supported by low heterogeneity (vaccine efficacy = 46%, 95% CI 33% to 57%, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 19%, P value for heterogeneity was 0.29). The point estimate for other population subgroups, adults with chronic illness and otherwise healthy adults from high-income countries, were inconclusive. For those with chronic illness there was a low level of heterogeneity (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 10%) but vaccine efficacy was 7% (-19% to 27%). A comparison of heterogeneity between these groups and the total pooled estimate was statistically significant (P &lt; 0.001), which also supports the conclusion that the overall estimate of effectiveness is not applicable to all population groups, who are at different risk and susceptibility to disease.</P>
<P>With the upper limit of the CI of the odds ratio (OR) at 0.93, excluding any study from this analysis results in a loss of significance (including sensitivity analysis based on trial quality). It should be acknowledged that the meta-analysis is inadequately powered to exclude a protective efficacy of less than 44%. This has been a consistent criticism of previous meta-analyses that remains valid in this updated review.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">All-cause mortality</HEADING>
<P>This meta-analysis has failed to demonstrate evidence for PPV effectiveness against mortality (all-cause or pneumococcal-related). All-cause mortality was reported in 14 studies with no evidence of a protective benefit from the meta-analysis (OR 0.90, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.09). The statistical heterogeneity (P &lt; 0.0001) of these pooled studies was again investigated by population group. We found the differences between otherwise healthy adults in low-income countries, adults with chronic illness in high-income countries and otherwise healthy adults in high-income countries to be significant (P &lt; 0.05), suggesting that the pooled estimate of effectiveness is not applicable to all population groups at different levels of risk and susceptibility to disease. It should be acknowledged that the meta-analysis is inadequately powered to exclude a protective efficacy of less than 26%, or a harmful effect less than 9%.</P>
<P>The use of influenza vaccine in three included studies may have influenced the ability of this meta-analysis to determine the efficacy of PPV against all-cause mortality. <LINK REF="STD-Furomoto-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Furomoto 2008</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Gaillat-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Gaillat 1985</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Kawakami-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Kawakami 2010</LINK> administered influenza vaccine to control participants only. The removal of these studies had only a slight effect on the pooled estimate of all trials in sensitivity analysis. <LINK REF="STD-Koivula-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Koivula 1997</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Leech-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Leech 1987</LINK> gave influenza vaccine to both PPV intervention and control participants, thereby only had the ability to show the benefit of PPV against all-cause mortality in addition to that achieved by influenza vaccination.</P>

<P>The combined studies from this relatively homogenous subgroup of young African miners and Papua New Guinean Highlanders consistently demonstrate elevated vaccine efficacy against various outcomes. Of note, vaccine efficacy has been demonstrated for all-cause pneumonia (four studies) and all-cause mortality (one study) for this population only. It is also important to highlight that the settings of these trials meant pneumococcal disease was likely to be caused by a limited number of serotypes, particularly in the mines, where pneumococcal outbreaks were a significant cause of mortality. In addition, the vaccines utilised in these trials had fewer serotypes and higher antigen content than the currently licensed 23-valent PPV. These findings highlight potential benefits of vaccination against pneumonia and death for otherwise healthy adults in low-income countries. Whether the findings from these early studies remain directly applicable today will depend on a range of factors including whether the circulating serotypes match those in the vaccine, the health status of the population, susceptibility to disease and risk of exposure.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Adults with chronic illness in high-income countries</HEADING>
<P>The subgroup analysis of RCTs in adults recruited on the basis of the presence of chronic illness in high-income countries consistently failed to demonstrate evidence of protective benefit of vaccination. For each of the outcomes included in subgroup analysis there were few events in either the intervention or control group and CIs were wide. This indicates that the combined studies remain underpowered. Whilst our review incorporated observational studies which included control for potential confounding factors such as chronic disease, we did not directly assess vaccine effectiveness against IPD for the chronic disease group.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Otherwise healthy adults in high-income countries</HEADING>
<P>The combined studies for this subgroup included participants recruited on the basis of older age or who were likely to be a disadvantaged population in high-income countries and demonstrated consistent evidence for protection against IPD. However, for the outcomes of all-cause pneumonia and all-cause mortality, there was a high level of statistical heterogeneity. The heterogeneity within all-cause pneumonia appears to be predominantly from <LINK REF="STD-Gaillat-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Gaillat 1985</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Kaufman-1947" TYPE="STUDY">Kaufman 1947</LINK>. The remaining four studies do not show evidence for protection against this outcome. The pooled estimate for all-cause mortality is also statistically heterogeneous, with <LINK REF="STD-Kaufman-1947" TYPE="STUDY">Kaufman 1947</LINK> being the only study to show protective benefit. Again, the remaining six studies do not show any evidence for protection against death within this population group.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2012-08-06 08:57:35 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>RCTs contributing data to this meta-analysis were conducted over a considerable period of time (1947 to 2010) and within distinct population groups, utilising various valencies of the vaccine (with differing amounts of antigen content). The current 23-valent PPV has been available since 1983 and was used in 10 of the 24 trials (with known vaccine valency) considered. The quality of the evidence and applicability of these findings to population groups currently recommended to receive the 23-valent PPV is consistently strong for protection from invasive pneumococcal disease but less clear with respect to less specific outcomes, including all-cause pneumonia.</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2012-11-14 00:04:22 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The main strengths of the review are the specificity of outcomes considered. Whilst the review has lost events from studies that considered less specific definitions, this was unlikely to have substantially altered the power of the meta-analysis. Considering the length of time that these vaccines have been licensed, the review is also strengthened by the inclusion of high-quality non-RCTs for the further consideration of culture confirmed IPD; which provided consistent evidence to support findings from the RCTs.</P>
<P>The main weakness of the review remains the lack of power with which to determine vaccine efficacy against pneumonia. This review also excluded two studies that were available only in abstract form in order to maintain the quality of the review. Whilst exclusion of non-published data may lead to an over-estimation of the intervention effect (where less significant results remain unpublished), this is unlikely to have had an influence on this review as both studies had positive findings for vaccine efficacy against pneumonia (<LINK REF="STD-Teramoto-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Teramoto 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ya-Tseimakh-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Ya Tseimakh 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>This review did not consider vaccine safety, as it was outside the scope of the review. The assessment of adverse events following PPV administration has been assessed in more recent studies (<LINK REF="REF-Cook-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cook 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jackson-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jackson 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Musher-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Musher 2010</LINK>).</P>
</POTENTIAL_BIASES>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2012-11-14 00:04:22 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In addition to the previous Cochrane Review (<LINK REF="REF-Moberley-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moberley 2008</LINK>), at least seven previous meta-analyses of PPV in adults have been published. However, depending on the selection criteria, results from these meta-analyses have been variable. Controversy continues to surround the effectiveness and value of the vaccine, particularly with respect to different disease outcomes and within different population groups.</P>
<P>A recent meta-analysis by <LINK REF="REF-Huss-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Huss 2009</LINK> was based on reporting of trial quality and has led to calls for withdrawal of the use of 23-valent PPV in high-risk groups (<LINK REF="REF-Jefferson-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jefferson 2009</LINK>). The most recent and best-quality clinical trials, as determined by <LINK REF="REF-Huss-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Huss 2009</LINK>, were conducted post-licensure, largely among populations with chronic illness or severe immunosuppression, or both. In these trials, there were very few cases of IPD: seven cases of definitive pneumococcal pneumonia from two studies and 44 cases of bacteraemia from six studies (most of which were among HIV-infected adults in Uganda). Overall, the findings from the <LINK REF="REF-Huss-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Huss 2009</LINK> study were similar to those presented in this updated Cochrane Review, with respect to effectiveness against presumptive pneumonia, all-cause pneumonia and death. However, the primary point of difference in this updated Cochrane Review is that the protective effect against IPD remained significant under sensitivity analysis, when the lower-quality trials were excluded.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Cornu-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cornu 2001</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Moore-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2000</LINK> and <LINK REF="REF-Fine-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fine 1994</LINK> concluded that the vaccine was effective against bacteraemic pneumococcal pneumonia in 'low-risk' healthy adults but the RCTs failed to demonstrate vaccine efficacy in those at 'high risk', a heterogeneous group which included older adults (55 years and above), those with chronic disease, or the immunosuppressed. Our results also failed to show evidence for protective efficacy in adults with chronic illness (discussed below). However, we have further refined this assessment and have found evidence of efficacy against IPD amongst otherwise healthy adults in developed country settings. This population consisted predominantly of older adults and institutionalised people.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Hutchison-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hutchison 1999</LINK> concluded that there was no evidence that the vaccine was less efficacious for older adults (55 years and above), institutionalised people or people with chronic disease. Whilst we did not directly measure vaccine efficacy against older adults or institutionalised people, the results of our meta-analysis do highlight apparent differences in efficacy amongst those participants selected on the basis of chronic illness, as will be discussed later.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Watson-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Watson 2002</LINK> found the vaccine was effective against mortality and all-cause pneumonia in non-industrialised countries but not in industrialised countries and noted that the small number of cases of pneumococcal bacteraemia made it difficult to draw any firm conclusions for this outcome. Like <LINK REF="REF-Watson-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Watson 2002</LINK>, our results highlight differences in vaccine efficacy amongst different population groups. Of particular note is the absence of heterogeneity within the population subgroups where IPD has been the outcome of interest but when these subgroups where compared against the total population there was strong evidence of heterogeneity, suggesting the pooled estimate may not be representative of each population group.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Puig_x002d_Barbera-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Puig-Barbera 2002</LINK> concluded there was no evidence supporting pneumococcal vaccine effectiveness to reduce or avoid <I>S. pneumoniae</I> disease in older adults (55 years and above) but this meta-analysis lacked power to adequately assess this outcome, with only four RCTs included.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Conaty-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Conaty 2004</LINK> conducted a systematic review of non-RCTs and compared results with those from RCTs, finding elevated point estimates of effectiveness from non-RCTs and non-significant results from pooled RCTs. Like <LINK REF="REF-Conaty-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Conaty 2004</LINK> and as with the previous Cochrane Review (<LINK REF="REF-Moberley-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moberley 2008</LINK>), this update again includes non-RCTs and shows supportive evidence of effectiveness against IPD. In contrast to both of these meta-analyses, however, our updated review also demonstrates protective efficacy against IPD from pooled RCTs.</P>

<P>This meta-analysis supports the use of pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPV) to prevent invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) in adults, particularly otherwise healthy adults, in high-income and low-income countries. The evidence from our meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) does not support the routine use of PPV to prevent all-cause pneumonia or mortality in adults.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2012-05-30 10:30:23 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Given the effectiveness of the vaccine in protecting individuals against IPD, commencing new RCTs in populations at risk where vaccine effectiveness and disease burden is known would face ethical difficulties, however, the 23-valent PPV may have a place as a control treatment in RCTs of conjugate or potential protein vaccine candidates, which this review does not consider.</P>
<P>We have highlighted the potential differences in vaccine effectiveness across population groups, where evidence of protective efficacy from RCTs is less clear with respect to adults with chronic illness. Given adults with chronic illness are the same population who are targeted for vaccination, further trials assessing vaccine efficacy against IPD amongst those with chronic disease appear warranted. However, such trials would need to be large given that this meta-analysis of five pooled studies remained underpowered against the rare event of IPD (2/1619 participants in the control group had the outcome of interest).</P>

<P>Dear Authors,</P>
<P>The inclusion of non-controlled studies in the current systematic review is clearly a step forward. The case-control studies enables an analysis of invasive pneumococcal disease that is not possible to do with the prospective studies that have been performed, due to lack of power. However, there is also a well performed cohort study, adjusted for background factors, that showed the same preventive efficacy against IPD (Jackson NEJM MAy 2003). Why was that not included? The search strategy stated that you included papers up to June 2003.</P>
<P>For your information, there are some new data from the study that was published as an early report in Lancet 2001 by Christenson et al. This, however, was published during the fall of 2003. (Hedlund J, Christenson B, Lundbergh P, Örtqvist Å. Effects of a large-scale intervention with influenza and 23-valent pneumococcal vaccines in elderly people: a one-year follow-up. Vaccine 2003; 21: 3906-11). Although we are still working with a "complete" background adjustment of the groups to minimise biases, the results of this paper was sex and age adjusted. In addition, a comparison was made between influenza season and non-influenza. In that comparison it can be seen that there was a significant prevention against both influenza, pneumonia and IPD during the influenza season in patients who had received influenza and/or pneumococcal vaccine. During the non-influenza season, however, there was no difference concerning influenza, whereas there was still a significant protection against pneumonia. For IPD the RR was the same as during the influenza season (0.47) but there was to few cases to make it significant.</P>
<P>
<BR/>Finally, in your conclusions you make a mistake by stating that typical figures of IPD in developed countries is about 10 per 100.000 per year. That may be so for the whole population but in the elderly where this calculation is of interest, the correct figure is about 50 per 100.000 per year, thereby reducing the NNT to about 4000 vaccinations per infection avoided.</P>
<P>With the best wishes,</P>

<P>The assessment of pneumococcal vaccine in preventing invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD)of this review is biased in favour of the vaccine and some graphs are misleading.</P>
<P>Take notice that:<BR/>No quality assessment has ben made of the observational studies included.</P>
<P>Results of heterogeneous studies are displayed in forest plots (see autoco 06 for instance) where results obtained in young adults are displayed with results obtained in the elderly. This is not appropriate and is misleading for the not expert.</P>
<P>Assessment of effectiveness of IPV rest on results of Kaufman 1947, no random assignment, no blind researchers, no placebo group, only three serotypes vaccine (?); Shapiro 1984, results go in favour of the vaccine when data is unmatched(!). Simm 1988, excluded 46% of subjects because of lack of information and did not provide information on pneumococcus serotypes; Shapiro 1991, excluded 121 cases because were originated by one of the 23 serotypes included in the 23 valent vaccine but nevertheless reports a non biased effectiveness in the elderly of 0,6 (IC95% 0,29 yo 1,23); and Butler 1993, no exposure information on 36% of subjects included, a rate that would invalidate any observational study.</P>
<P>This could go on but you can go to Puig-Barbera et al to get a much more "Cochrane" description and analysis of the data available.</P>
<P>In our current state of knowledge it cannot be assured that the polysaccharide non-conjugated vaccine is free of deleterious effects in the elderly. Applying the precautionary principle this possibility should be clearly discarded. Meanwhile influenza vaccine does a tremendous good job preventing pneumonia in the elderly.</P>

<P>We entirely agree that any positive assessment of the vaccine rests on the very old pseudo-randomised trial of Kaufman (1947), and on the observational studies. However, we do point out the crucial importance of the Kaufman study in the RCT part of our review. Our analyses are presented both with and without this study for this reason. Indeed our conclusions from this part of the review are decidedly negative: for example we suggest that a large RCT carried out now would fail to show any benefit. We include a table showing how the apparent efficacy of the vaccine increases monotonically as one progressively includes the poorer quality, older studies, and point out that several recent high quality randomised studies consistently showed no effect against all-cause pneumonia. Fedson and Liss have argued that the failure of other meta-analyses to demonstrate a benefit against this outcome should be seen as an inconclusive rather than negative result on the grounds that, if 30 to 50% of all pneumonias are pneumococcal, a VE of 50% against pneumococcal pneumonia equates to a VE of 15 to 25% against all-cause pneumonia.(Fedson, 2004) Our results cannot discount this possibility.</P>
<P>
<BR/>We note your concern about the inclusion criteria for observational studies but believe a more fundamental issue was the decision to incorporate observational studies within the review. Our initial review was conducted in accordance with the protocol. That version of the review reached a largely negative assessment of the efficacy of polysaccharide pneumococcal vaccines in preventing pneumonia and death. It was felt by the Editors that this would deliver an unbalanced message, since it made no mention of other important medical endpoints that the RCTs do not address, in particular invasive pneumococcal disease. The review was therefore expanded specifically in order to include the observational studies and it could be argued that the impact of this decision was to bias the review in favour of the vaccine. Whether such a process is proper for a Cochrane Systematic Review is perhaps doubtful but we have still attempted to assess the evidence fairly. We note that Ave Ortqvist has indicated support for this approach in other comments posted on this review.</P>

<BR/>Dr Puig-Barbera suggests we should read the paper by Puig-Barbera et al to "get a much more "Cochrane" description and analysis of the data available". The clear implication here is that our results are biased by the manner in which we included and analysed the non-randomised studies. It is true that we have not included a formal, numerical assessment of quality of the observational studies. Probably there is no scale for such studies that would serve as well as the Jadad scale does for RCTs. We have noted the criteria used for assessment of observational studies by Puig-Barbera et al but do not agree that these criteria are any more valid than the approach used by us. We note with interest that according to the criteria of Puig-Barbera et al, the study by Forrester et al was rated ahead of a number of other observational studies and was included when others were excluded. In our review, we have described a number of serious flaws in Forrester et al, not least of which was the failure to conduct a matched analysis on a matched case-control study.</P>
<P>
<BR/>From the paper by Puig-Barbera et al, it appears that the observational studies have been analysed in an unmatched fashion. We believe this is invalid since, as we have explained in our review, all but one of the observational studies included were matched case-control studies. For our analysis we combined the estimates of OR based on conditional logistic regression in each study (which accounts for the matching) and calculated a weighted average log-OR using Stata. Furthermore, it is simplistic to assume that an unmatched analysis of such studies will always approach the null and that failure to do so represents bias in the study.</P>
<P>
<BR/>We do acknowledge that it might be of value to report the high exclusion rates in the observational studies and are grateful for the (implied) suggestion. As for the forest plots, they can be stratified in many ways. We suggest that the date of publication is more important in this regard than the age range of subjects.</P>
<P>
<BR/>We agree with Dr Ortqvist's suggestion that the NNT should be calculated for the older age group rather than for all adults.</P>
<P>
<BR/>We thank Dr Puig-Barbera and Dr Ortqvist for their comments, and thank the Comments Editor for permitting this response.</P>

<P>Dear Dr Puig-Barbera,</P>
<P>There are small or big flaws in all studies. The results of the case-control studies included in the Cochrane analysis are corroborated by the results of the two most recent prospective studies (Honkanen and our own) where there was a clear trend for a 70-80% protection of the 23-valent vaccine against bacteraemic pneumococcal pneumonia. A similar finding was published in a cohort study, adjusted for background factors, by Lisa Jackson in NEJM 2003.</P>
<P>Although I agree with you concerning the good effect of influenza vaccine, you're of course aware of that there is no prospective controlled study in the elderly showing that influenza vaccine prevents against severe influenza or pneumonia? The only controlled study showing a protection of the vaccine against clinical (irrespective of severity) and serological influenza.</P>
<P>With the best wishes,</P>
