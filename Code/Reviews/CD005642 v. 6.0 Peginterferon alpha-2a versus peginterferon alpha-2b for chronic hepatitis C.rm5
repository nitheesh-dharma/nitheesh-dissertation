</B>
</P>
<P>Hepatitis C is a disease of the liver caused by the hepatitis C virus. Globally, an estimated 170 million people are chronically infected with hepatitis C virus. Chronic hepatitis C can cause liver damage in the form of inflammation and scarring of the liver (cirrhosis). Liver damage can lead to liver failure and other complications, including liver cancer. The aim of the treatment for chronic hepatitis C is to prevent complications of hepatitis C infection. This might be achieved by clearing the virus from the blood of the patient. However, we still need to understand if clearance of virus from blood has any association with patient-relevant and clinically-relevant outcomes. A combination of weekly injections of peginterferon alpha and daily oral ribavirin still represents the standard of care for the majority of patients with chronic hepatitis C. Currently, there are two licensed products of peginterferon, peginterferon alpha-2a and peginterferon alpha-2b, on the market.</P>
<P>

<I>The main findings of the review </I>
</B>
</P>
<P>The review identified 17 randomised clinical trials. The trials reported on patient-relevant outcomes only occasionally. All trials had high risk of bias ie, a trial might systematically overestimate benefits or underestimate harms of the treatments). Both treatments were associated with a high risk of experiencing adverse events, which may lead to discontinuation of the treatment. Twelve trials reported on clearing the virus from blood six months after the end of treatment. A summary of the current evidence in this review suggests that peginterferon alpha-2a has higher chances of clearing the virus from the patient's blood than peginterferon alpha-2b (in 50% compared with 43%).</P>

<P>A combination of weekly pegylated interferon (peginterferon) alpha and daily ribavirin still represents standard treatment of chronic hepatitis C infection in the majority of patients.

<P>To systematically evaluate the benefits and harms of peginterferon alpha-2a versus peginterferon alpha-2b in head-to-head randomised clinical trials in patients with chronic hepatitis C.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2013-12-22 09:48:04 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL)<I> </I>in <I>The Cochrane Library, </I>MEDLINE, EMBASE, Science Citation Index Expanded, and LILACS<I> </I>until October 2013<I>. </I>We also searched conference abstracts, journals, and grey literature.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2013-12-23 12:28:03 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included randomised clinical trials comparing peginterferon alpha-2a versus peginterferon alpha-2b given with or without co-intervention(s) (for example, ribavirin) for chronic hepatitis C. Quasi-randomised studies and observational studies as identified by the searches were also considered for assessment of harms. Our primary outcomes were all-cause mortality, liver-related morbidity, serious adverse events, adverse events leading to treatment discontinuation, other adverse events, and quality of life. The secondary outcome was sustained virological response in the blood serum.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2013-12-23 12:28:03 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two authors independently used a standardised data collection form. We meta-analysed data with both the fixed-effect and the random-effects models. For each outcome we calculated the relative risk (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) based on intention-to-treat analysis. We used domains of the trials to assess the risk of systematic errors (bias) and trial sequential analyses to assess the risks of random errors (play of chance). Intervention effects on the outcomes were assessed according to GRADE.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-01-17 04:49:17 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included 17 randomised clinical trials which compared peginterferon alpha-2a plus ribavirin versus peginterferon alpha-2b plus ribavirin in 5847 patients. All trials had a high risk of bias. Very few trials reported data on very few patients for the patient-relevant outcomes all-cause mortality, liver-related morbidity, serious adverse events, and quality of life. Accordingly, we were unable to conduct meta-analyses on all-cause mortality, liver-related morbidity, and quality of life. Twelve trials reported on adverse events leading to discontinuation of treatment without clear evidence of a difference<I> </I>between the two peginterferons (197/2171 (9.1%) versus 311/3169 (9.9%); RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.22; I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 44%; low quality evidence). A trial sequential analysis showed that we could exclude a relative risk reduction of 20% or more on this outcome. Peginterferon alpha-2a significantly increased the number of patients who achieved a sustained virological response in the blood serum compared with peginterferon alpha-2b (1069/2099 (51%) versus 1327/3075 (43%); RR 1.12, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.18; I<SUP>2</SUP>= 0%, 12 trials; moderate quality evidence). Trial sequential analyses supported this result. Subgroup analyses based on risk of bias, viral genotype, and treatment history yielded similar results. Trial sequential analyses supported the results in patients with genotypes 1 and 4, but not in patients with genotypes 2 and 3.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2014-01-19 21:19:08 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is lack of evidence on patient-important outcomes and paucity of evidence on adverse events. Moderate quality evidence suggests that peginterferon alpha-2a is associated with a higher sustained virological response in serum than with peginterferon alpha-2b. This finding may be affected by the high risk of bias of the included studies . The clinical consequences of peginterferon alpha-2a versus peginterferon alpha-2b are unknown, and we cannot translate an effect on sustained virological response into comparable clinical effects because sustained virological response is still an unvalidated surrogate outcome for patient-important outcomes. The lack of evidence on patient-important outcomes and the paucity of evidence on adverse events means that we are unable to draw any conclusions about the effects of one peginterferon over the other.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2013-12-23 12:30:17 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Globally, an estimated 170 million people are chronically infected with hepatitis C virus, and three to four million people are newly infected each year (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1999</LINK>). In the majority of patients, acute hepatitis C infection is asymptomatic. Hepatitis C infection is generally recognised in the chronic phase (<LINK REF="REF-Hodgson-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hodgson 2003</LINK>). Around 85% of patients who become infected with hepatitis C fail to clear the virus and become chronic carriers of hepatitis C virus. Among these individuals, 5% to 20% are reported to develop cirrhosis over a period of approximately 20 to 25 years (<LINK REF="REF-Seeff-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Seeff 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Seef-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Seef 2009</LINK>). Patients with advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis develop liver complications such as hepatocellular carcinoma with an annual proportion of 2% to 4% (<LINK REF="REF-Benvegnu-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Benvegnu 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fattovich-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fattovich 2002</LINK>). Furthermore, chronic hepatitis C is the single most common indication for liver transplantation (<LINK REF="REF-OPTN-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">OPTN 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>Hepatitis C virus is an enveloped RNA virus that constitutes the genus <I>Hepacivirus</I> within the <I>Flaviviridae</I> family (<LINK REF="REF-van-Regenmorte-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Regenmorte 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Penin-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Penin 2004</LINK>). Hepatitis C virus is divided into six genotypes, which differ from each other by up to 30% in the nucleotide sequence, and has a large and growing number of subtypes (<LINK REF="REF-Rosenberg-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rosenberg 2001</LINK>). Hepatitis C virus genotypes differ with geographic region (<LINK REF="REF-Davis-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davis 1999</LINK>). Although a genotype does not predict the outcome of the infection, it does predict the likelihood of virologic treatment response and, in many cases, determines the duration of treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Manns-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Manns 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fried-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fried 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hadziyannis-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hadziyannis 2004</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2014-01-17 05:11:24 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Dimitrinka Nikolova">
<P>The aim of treatment of chronic hepatitis C is to prevent complications of the hepatitis C infection. This is principally sought by eradication of the infection in the serum (<LINK REF="REF-Ghany-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ghany 2009</LINK>). Accordingly, treatment is aimed to achieve a virological response, defined as the absence of hepatitis C virus RNA in the blood serum, measured by a sensitive test six months after the end of treatment (that is, a sustained virological response). Monotherapy with interferon produces a sustained virological response in less than 20% of patients (<LINK REF="REF-Myers-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Myers 2002</LINK>). The introduction of combination therapy with interferon plus ribavirin was considered a major advance due to a greater effect on the sustained virological response in the blood (<LINK REF="REF-Brok-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brok 2005</LINK>). The next improvement in chronic hepatitis C treatment was the development of direct-acting antiviral (DAA) agents, boceprevir (BOC) and teleprevir (TVR). The two DAAs have demonstrated significant inhibition of hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 1 replication and markedly improved the sustained virological response rate (<LINK REF="REF-Ghany-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ghany 2011</LINK>). Unfortunately due to the high price of such a triple regimen it is still not affordable to patients in many countries. Furthermore, we do not have sufficient data about the efficacy of BOC and TVR in the treatment of HCV genotype 2 and 3 infections, which leaves pegylated interferon (peginterferon) plus ribavirin as the major treatment option for the majority of patients. Combination therapy with interferon and ribavirin produces a sustained virological response in approximately 40% of previously untreated patients (<LINK REF="REF-Brok-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brok 2005</LINK>). The majority of randomised clinical trials primarily assess sustained virological response, which is a surrogate marker, instead of outcomes which might be of more interest for patients and clinicians such as all-cause mortality, liver-related morbidity, and progression to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) (<LINK REF="REF-Gluud-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gluud 2007</LINK>). Recently, some groups have published results of trials with longer duration of follow-up of patients with advanced hepatitis C who achieved a sustained virological response (<LINK REF="REF-Fernandez_x002d_-Rodriguez-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fernandez- Rodriguez 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Morgan-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morgan 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Di-Biscceglie-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Di Biscceglie 2011</LINK>). The authors reported marked reductions in liver-related morbidity, no significant difference in liver-related mortality, and a significantly higher mortality in those treated with long-term peginterferon (<LINK REF="REF-Di-Biscceglie-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Di Biscceglie 2011</LINK>). Furthermore, we still lack data about adverse events, quality of life during the treatment, all-cause morbidity and mortality due to suicide, anaemia, or infections. Therefore, sustained virological response should still be considered as a non-validated surrogate outcome, that is, an outcome which should not be used to guide clinical decision making (<LINK REF="REF-Gluud-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gluud 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Koretz-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Koretz 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gurusamy-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gurusamy 2014</LINK>). A combination of weekly subcutaneous injections of long-acting peginterferon alpha and oral ribavirin has achieved the highest overall sustained virological response rates of 56% (<LINK REF="REF-Ghany-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ghany 2009</LINK>). This still represents the standard of care for the majority of patients according to The American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases and European Association for the Study of Liver Disease guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-Ghany-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ghany 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ghany-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ghany 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-EASL-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">EASL 2012</LINK>). However, approximately 75% of those treated with either peginterferon alpha or interferon alpha experience one or more adverse events (for example, influenza-like symptoms, depression, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, etc.) (<LINK REF="REF-Ghany-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ghany 2009</LINK>). Pegylation involves the addition of polyethylene glycol molecules to the interferon molecule, thus decreasing renal clearance, altering metabolism, and increasing the half life of the peginterferon molecule in the circulation. This necessitates fewer doses (<LINK REF="REF-Reddy-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reddy 2001</LINK>). Currently, there are two licensed products of peginterferon, peginterferon alpha-2a (Pegasys®, Hoffmann-La Roche), which consists of a 40 kDa branched pegylated chain linked to the interferon molecule (<LINK REF="REF-Bailon-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bailon 2001</LINK>), and peginterferon alpha-2b (Peg-Intron®, Schering-Plough Corporation) consisting of a 12 kDa linear pegylated chain linked to the interferon molecule (<LINK REF="REF-Glue-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glue 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Foster-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Foster 2004</LINK>). In particular, pegylation reduces the rapid kidney clearance of a given protein by increasing its hydrodynamic volume, prevents immunogenicity by acting at different levels, reduces protein aggregation owing to a repulsion between pegylated surfaces, and increases the thermal stability of proteins (<LINK REF="REF-Pasut-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pasut 2011</LINK>). The pegylate and its conjugates are mainly excreted by kidney clearance and the excretion rate is significantly reduced for molecular weights over 40 kDa (<LINK REF="REF-Pasut-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pasut 2011</LINK>). The different mechanisms of the pegylated interferon induced different pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties include that peginterferon alpha-2a has a higher molecular weight (40 kDa versus 12 kDa), a longer half-life, a lower body distribution volume, and different routes of elimination because peginterferon alpha-2a is mainly eliminated by the liver while peginterferon alpha-2b is mainly eliminated by the kidney (<LINK REF="REF-Glue-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glue 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bailon-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bailon 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Foster-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Foster 2004</LINK>).</P>

<P>Lately, there has been considerable controversy over which treatment option of peginterferon is the most effective one (<LINK REF="STD-McHutchison-2009" TYPE="STUDY">McHutchison 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lee-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Lee 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kamal-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Kamal 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Miyase-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Miyase 2012</LINK>). A large randomised clinical trial has recently concluded that the two peginterferons are comparable in both benefits and harms (<LINK REF="STD-McHutchison-2009" TYPE="STUDY">McHutchison 2009</LINK>) but the majority of other trials, although with smaller numbers of patients, conclude that there are significant differences between the two peginterferons (<LINK REF="STD-Kamal-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Kamal 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mach-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Mach 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Miyase-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Miyase 2012</LINK>). However, findings from a single randomised trial, even a very large one, are rarely definitive and caution should be taken to ensure reproducibility of the findings (<LINK REF="REF-Lau-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lau 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lacchetti-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lacchetti 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Trikalinos-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Trikalinos 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ioannidis-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ioannidis 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ioannidis-2005a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ioannidis 2005a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Thorlund-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thorlund 2009</LINK>). Systematic reviews and meta-analyses including all available trials are considered the highest level of evidence as they provide valuable information on the quality of the available evidence and provide the greatest statistical strength. Hence, the risks of systematic errors as well as random errors are smaller in systematic reviews than in single trials. We have, therefore, conducted a Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group systematic review to identify, assess, and analyse all randomised trials to add to the existing body of evidence and strengthen inferences about which peginterferon would work best with fewer possible harms to the patient. A previous version of this review that was published in Hepatology suggested that peginterferon alpha-2a leads to a significantly higher proportion of patients with sustained virological response than with peginterferon alpha-2b (<LINK REF="REF-Awad-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Awad 2010</LINK>), while the safety profile remained comparable. The present review provides an update with improved methodology and includes three more randomised clinical trials. There are several meta-analyses that have been published recently which compare the efficacy and safety of the two pegylated interferons (<LINK REF="REF-Alavian-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alavian 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Barros-2010c" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barros 2010c</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cheinquer-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cheinquer 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zhao-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhao 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Coppola-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Coppola 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Singal-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Singal 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Druyits-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Druyits 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Romero_x002d_Gomez-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Romero-Gomez 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Flori-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Flori 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Yang-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yang 2013</LINK>). Four of them have been published as abstracts only (<LINK REF="REF-Barros-2010c" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barros 2010c</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cheinquer-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cheinquer 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Coppola-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Coppola 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Romero_x002d_Gomez-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Romero-Gomez 2012</LINK>) and despite the different numbers of included studies and different outcomes observed, their common conclusion is that pegylated interferon alpha-2a has advances in terms of efficacy over the pegylated interferon alpha-2b. Six meta-analyses that were published as full papers uniformly report superior efficacy of pegylated interferon alpha-2a over pegylated interferon alpha-2b while the safety profile remains comparable for both treatments (<LINK REF="REF-Alavian-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alavian 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zhao-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhao 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Singal-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Singal 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Druyits-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Druyits 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Flori-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Flori 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Yang-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yang 2013</LINK>). One meta-analysis (<LINK REF="REF-Druyits-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Druyits 2012</LINK>) is not comparable to ours because it has a different search strategy and inclusion criteria. The author did not assess the risk of bias and included studies which were not head-to-head comparisons. Four meta-analyses (<LINK REF="REF-Alavian-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alavian 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zhao-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhao 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Singal-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Singal 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Yang-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yang 2013</LINK>) have similar search strategies and outcomes as in <LINK REF="REF-Awad-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Awad 2010</LINK>, but they included fewer trials and smaller numbers of patients. They included seven trials with 3518 patients (<LINK REF="REF-Alavian-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alavian 2010</LINK>); seven trials with 3212 patients (<LINK REF="REF-Zhao-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhao 2010</LINK>); nine trials with 3546 patients (<LINK REF="REF-Singal-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Singal 2011</LINK>); and seven trials with 3668 patients (<LINK REF="REF-Yang-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yang 2013</LINK>). They excluded conference abstracts or limited participants only to patients naive to previous antiviral intervention. However, results of those meta-analyses are in concordance with our conclusions on the higher efficacy of pegylated interferon alpha-2a and similar safety profile among the pegylated interferons (<LINK REF="REF-Awad-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Awad 2010</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Assessment of risks of random errors (play of chance)</HEADING>
<P>Random errors may play an important role in the evaluation of meta-analyses due to sparse data and multiplicity from repetitive testing. To assess the reliability of inferences from our meta-analysis on sustained virological response, we calculated the required information size which is the required sample size for the meta-analysis to detect a 10% relative risk reduction in sustained virological response. We assumed an average event proportion of 50% in the control group, assuming that 30% of the variation in the meta-analysis would be explained by variation across trials, and used statistical error levels of alpha = 5% and beta = 10% (90% power) or beta = 20% (80% power). Meta-analyses conducted before surpassing the required sample size are considered analogous to interim analyses in a single randomised trial, and thus they necessitate adjustment of the threshold for statistical significance to maintain the predetermined maximum risk of obtaining a false positive result (set to alpha = 5% in our analysis). We, therefore, substituted the conventional 5% threshold for statistical significance with those of the Lan-DeMets trial sequential monitoring boundaries (<LINK REF="REF-Bangalore-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bangalore 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Brok-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brok 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rambaldi-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rambaldi 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wetterslev-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wetterslev 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Brok-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brok 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Thorlund-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thorlund 2009</LINK>). We used trial sequential analysis (<LINK REF="REF-CTU-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">CTU 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Thorlund-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thorlund 2011</LINK>). On the basis of the required information size and risk for type I (5%) and type II (10% or 20%) errors, trial sequential monitoring boundaries were constructed (<LINK REF="REF-Brok-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brok 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wetterslev-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wetterslev 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Brok-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brok 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Thorlund-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thorlund 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wetterslev-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wetterslev 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Thorlund-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thorlund 2010</LINK>). These boundaries determine the statistical inference one may draw regarding the cumulative meta-analysis that has not reached the required information size. If a trial sequential monitoring boundary is crossed by the cumulative Z-score before the required information size is reached in a cumulative meta-analysis, firm evidence may have been established and further trials may be superfluous. On the other hand, if the boundaries are not surpassed, it is most probably necessary to continue doing further trials in order to detect or reject a certain intervention effect. We used as the default a type I error of 5%, type II error of 10% or 20%, and adjusted the information size for heterogeneity within diversity unless otherwise stated (<LINK REF="REF-Brok-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brok 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wetterslev-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wetterslev 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Brok-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brok 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Thorlund-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thorlund 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wetterslev-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wetterslev 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Thorlund-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thorlund 2010</LINK>).</P>

<P>All trials had one or more domains with high risk of bias. Accordingly, all information in our review originated from trials that were assessed as trials with high risk of bias (<LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>; <LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>). Eleven trials had sequence generation and nine had allocation concealment with low risk of bias. Blinding of the outcome assessors, however, was not clear in most of the trials. We considered this bias less important for the outcome sustained virological response. Two trials without risk of blinding bias reported results regarding sustained virological response (<LINK REF="STD-Kamal-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Kamal 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Miyase-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Miyase 2012</LINK>). Incomplete outcome data were adequately addressed in 10 trials. It was difficult to assess selective outcome reporting due to the unavailability of the trial protocols. Most trials did not report on the primary outcomes of our review.

<HEADING LEVEL="3">All-cause mortality</HEADING>
<P>Only one trial reported all-cause mortality (<LINK REF="STD-McHutchison-2009" TYPE="STUDY">McHutchison 2009</LINK>). The authors reported 12 patients who died during the treatment or follow-up period. Six patients died in the peginterferon alpha-2a group and six patients died in the peginterferon alpha-2b group (RR 1.97, 95% CI 0.64 to 6.08) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>). Only two deaths were considered by the authors to be possibly related to the intervention drug: one person, who was treated with peginterferon alpha-2b, committed suicide six months after the end of treatment; and another, who was treated with peginterferon alpha-2a, died due to myocardial infarction. In order to detect or reject a RR reduction of 20%, the calculated required information size was n = 132,938 patients. Accordingly, we had less than 1% of the required information size, and we could not make any conclusions about the potential similarities or differences regarding the effects of the two peginterferons on all-cause mortality.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Liver-related morbidity</HEADING>
<P>One trial with 36 patients reported on liver-related morbidity (hyperbilirubinaemia) (<LINK REF="STD-Silva-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Silva 2006</LINK>). Six patients in the peginterferon alpha-2a group and two patients in the peginterferon alpha-2b group had hyperbilirubinaemia (RR 3.00, 95% CI 0.70 to12.93) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>). In order to detect or reject a RR reduction of 20%, the required information size should be at least n = 1480 patients. This was far above the number we had in the included trials, and we could not make any firm conclusions about potential similarities or differences regarding the effects of the two peginterferons on liver-related morbidity.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Adverse events</HEADING>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Serious adverse events</HEADING>
<P>The authors of four trials reported serious adverse events according to the International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) Guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-ICH_x002d_GCP-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">ICH-GCP 1997</LINK>) (<LINK REF="STD-Laguno-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Laguno 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McHutchison-2009" TYPE="STUDY">McHutchison 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rumi-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Rumi 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kamal-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Kamal 2011</LINK>). The proportion of patients with serious adverse events, in four trials, was quite low. In the trial which included HIV co-infected patients, adverse events occurred in 55% of the patients (<LINK REF="STD-Laguno-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Laguno 2009</LINK>). The meta-analysis yielded a RR of 1.12 (95% CI 0.95 to 1.30) using the fixed -effect model (<LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>). Using RR as the measure of effect, the Cochran homogeneity test statistic yielded a P value of 0.78 and the heterogeneity was I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 0%. Because our meta-analysis did not reach the required information size (n = 6115), we used trial sequential monitoring boundaries, calculated with TSA, to adjust the thresholds for statistical significance accordingly. Using the random-effects model, the resulting cumulative test statistic (Z-score) did not cross the adjusted threshold for statistical significance, thus yielding a non-significant difference between the two peginterferons regarding serious adverse events (<LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK>).</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Adverse events leading to treatment discontinuation</HEADING>
<P>The meta-analysis of adverse events leading to treatment discontinuation, using data from 12 trials,<I> </I>yielded a RR of 0.84 (95% CI 0.57 to 1.22) using the random-effects model (<LINK REF="CMP-001.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.4</LINK>) (<LINK REF="STD-Bruno-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Bruno 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sinha-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Sinha 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Berak-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Berak 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Silva-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Silva 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yenice-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Yenice 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Di-Bisceglie-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Di Bisceglie 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Scotto-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Scotto 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Laguno-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Laguno 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McHutchison-2009" TYPE="STUDY">McHutchison 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ascione-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Ascione 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rumi-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Rumi 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kamal-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Kamal 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Miyase-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Miyase 2012</LINK>). Using RR as the measure of effect, the Cochran homogeneity test statistic yielded a P value of 0.05 and the heterogeneity was I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 44%. Due to funnel plot asymmetry we could not exclude possible bias (<LINK REF="FIG-04" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 4</LINK>).<BR/>
</P>
<P>Because our meta-analysis did not reach the required information size (n = 12,382), we used trial sequential monitoring boundaries calculated with TSA to adjust the thresholds for statistical significance accordingly. Using the random-effects model, the resulting cumulative test statistic (Z-score) did not cross the adjusted threshold for statistical significance. The Z-score crossed the trial sequential monitoring boundary for futility. Accordingly, we could reject a 20% difference in causation of adverse events leading to discontinuation of the treatment between the two peginterferons (<LINK REF="FIG-05" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 5</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Other (non-serious) adverse events</HEADING>
<P>In nine included trials, the authors reported on numerous adverse events not leading to treatment discontinuation (<LINK REF="STD-Silva-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Silva 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Di-Bisceglie-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Di Bisceglie 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Scotto-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Scotto 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Laguno-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Laguno 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McHutchison-2009" TYPE="STUDY">McHutchison 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ascione-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Ascione 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rumi-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Rumi 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kamal-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Kamal 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Miyase-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Miyase 2012</LINK>) but which surely could have influenced adherence to the treatment protocol (<LINK REF="STD-Laguno-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Laguno 2009</LINK>). Adverse events included haematological changes (for example, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and anaemia), psychological (for example, depression), and other systemic adverse events (for example, fatigue, headache, insomnia, fever, nausea, and dyspnoea). However, the reporting of adverse events not leading to treatment discontinuation was poor and inconsistent across all included trials and prevented any statistical analysis.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Assessing quality of life</HEADING>
<P>Although quality of life is a very important outcome for the patients, it was rarely reported in the randomised clinical trials. Only one trial assessed quality of life in both treatment groups (peginterferon alpha-2a versus peginterferon alpha-2b) during and after the treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Kamal-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Kamal 2011</LINK>). Using the Short Form 36 and Chronic Liver Disease Questionnaires (CLDQ), Kamal et al concluded that quality of life after the treatment was significantly better in the peginterferon alpha-2a group than in the peginterferon alpha-2b group regarding physical functioning, vitality, emotional role, bodily pain, and almost all domains of the CLDQ, overall score 5.9 versus 5.5 (P = 0.01) (peginterferon alpha-2a versus peginterferon alpha-2b).</P>

Using RR as the measure of effect, the Cochran homogeneity test statistic yielded a P value of 0.53 and the heterogeneity was I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 0%. The number needed to treat (NNT) to obtain an extra patient with a sustained virological response was estimated to be 25 patients (95% CI 14 to 100 patients).</P>
<P>A funnel plot of the included trials showed no significant asymmetry (<LINK REF="FIG-06" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 6</LINK>). For the outcome sustained virological response we estimated that the meta-analysis needed to include a total of 5471 patients in order to detect or reject a RR reduction of 10%. We used trial sequential monitoring boundaries to assess statistical significance. Using the random-effects model, the resulting cumulative test statistic (Z-score) crossed the trial sequential monitoring boundary, thus yielding a robust statistically significant difference between the two peginterferons regarding sparse data and repetitive testing (<LINK REF="FIG-07" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 7</LINK>).</P>

For sustained virological response in the genotype 1 and 4 infected patients, we estimated that for the required information size a meta-analysis needed to include a total of n = 6375 patients to detect or reject a RR reduction of 10%.

Using the random-effects model, the resulting cumulative test statistic (Z-score) reached the area of futility, thus yielding a robust statistically significant difference between the two peginterferons regarding sparse data and repetitive testing (<LINK REF="FIG-10" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 10</LINK>).</P>
<P>A subgroup analysis in the two trials with low risk of bias according to blinding (<LINK REF="STD-Kamal-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Kamal 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Miyase-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Miyase 2012</LINK>) yielded a RR in favour of peginterferon alpha-2a on sustained virological response (RR 1.29, 95% CI 1.10 to 1.51) using the random-effects model (<LINK REF="CMP-002.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.4</LINK>). Using RR as the measure of effect, the Cochran homogeneity test statistic yielded a P value of 0.95 and the heterogeneity was I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 0% (<LINK REF="CMP-002.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.4</LINK>). For sustained virological response in trials with low risk of bias according to blinding, we estimated that the needed required information size was 2079 patients in order to detect or reject a RR of 10%. Because our present meta-analysis did not reach the required information size of 2079, we used trial sequential monitoring boundaries to assess the risk of random error. Using the random-effects model, the resulting cumulative test statistic (Z-score) did not break the monitoring boundaries, thus yielding no statistically significant difference between the two peginterferons (<LINK REF="FIG-11" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 11</LINK>).</P>

Using RR as the measure of effect, the Cochran homogeneity test statistic yielded a P value of 0.69 and the heterogeneity was I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 0% (<LINK REF="CMP-002.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.4</LINK>).

<P>We constructed 'Summary of findings' table using The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation guidelines (GRADE) (<LINK REF="REF-Guyatt-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guyatt 2008</LINK>). The information provided on the 'Summary of findings' table shows that we are very uncertain regarding the effects of the interventions on all-cause mortality, liver-related morbidity, all other adverse events, and quality of life which we have judged to be of low or very low quality evidence (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>). We have only low level confidence in the current evidence on harms measured as serious adverse events and adverse events leading to discontinuation of treatment for a number of different reasons. Furthermore, the table reveals that we had moderate confidence in the current evidence on treatment benefits measured as sustained virological response because all trial are with high risk of bias. The reason was that 5 out of 17 trials did not report on this outcome, raising suspicion of outcome reporting bias. Because the meta-analysis for sustained virological response included 12 trials, we drew a funnel plot to explore bias and did not find significant asymmetry. The meta-analysis included a seemingly reasonable mix of small and large trials yielding fairly consistent results, thus giving little concern regarding the presence of bias in the trials reporting the outcome (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>).</P>

<P>In this systematic review we have summarised the available evidence from randomised clinical trials comparing peginterferon alpha-2a versus peginterferon alpha-2b, both given in combination with orally administered ribavirin administered in doses in accordance with the weight of the patient. Our results suggest that only one trial reported on mortality (<LINK REF="STD-McHutchison-2009" TYPE="STUDY">McHutchison 2009</LINK>); only one trial reported on liver-related morbidity (<LINK REF="STD-Silva-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Silva 2006</LINK>); and no trial reported on liver-related mortality. Therefore, our present knowledge regarding patient-important outcomes is very sparse. Our results also suggest that the two peginterferons are comparable in regard to adverse events leading to treatment discontinuation and serious and non-serious adverse events. However, evidence on adverse events is also sparse and the meta-analysis on adverse events is likely to be underpowered to detect any significant differences. Likewise, evidence on quality of life was sparse. The combination of peginterferon alpha-2a and weight-based ribavirin may achieve a significantly higher sustained virological response than the combination of peginterferon alpha-2b and weight-based ribavirin. </P>

<P>The GRADE (<LINK REF="REF-Guyatt-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guyatt 2008</LINK>) summary of findings table reveals that, in general, we can have moderate confidence in the current evidence on treatment benefits measured as sustained virological response and we can only have low confidence in the current evidence on harms measured as all-cause mortality, liver-related morbidity, serious adverse events, and adverse events leading to treatment discontinuation (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>). Information to assess the risk of bias was incomplete in a few trials with small numbers of participants. However, our sensitivity analyses did not show any important change in the intervention effects when we focused on trials with lower risk of bias. In our study, the trials that adequately reported on the trial methodology are large trials and they dominate the estimates of intervention effects from the meta-analyses. Therefore, it is less likely that the pooled estimates are biased. In the meta-analysis for sustained virological response, there were no serious inconsistencies across trials and the meta-analysis crossed the Lan-DeMets monitoring boundary (trial sequential monitoring boundary) leaving any random error less likely. The comparison of the largest trial (<LINK REF="STD-McHutchison-2009" TYPE="STUDY">McHutchison 2009</LINK>) with the second and third largest trials (<LINK REF="STD-Ascione-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Ascione 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rumi-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Rumi 2010</LINK>) yielded discrepancies however. The largest trial, which was funded by the manufacturer of peginterferon alpha-2b, observed the smallest benefit of peginterferon alpha-2a whereas the second and third largest trials both reported peginterferon alpha-2a to be significantly superior to peginterferon alpha-2b, and these trials were not funded by either of the two manufacturers. It is well known that industry bias may affect the outcomes and interpretation of trials (<LINK REF="REF-Als_x002d_Nielsen-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Als-Nielsen 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lexchin-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lexchin 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lundh-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lundh 2012</LINK>).</P>

<P>Because the meta-analysis for sustained virological response included 12 trials, we drew a funnel plot to explore bias (<LINK REF="FIG-06" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 6</LINK>). There was no significant asymmetry. The meta-analysis included a seemingly reasonable mix of small and large trials yielding fairly consistent results, which gives little concern about the presence of publication bias and other biases. When we included only trials without risk of bias due to other factors than lack of blinding, the results remained the same regarding sustained virological response. This effect did not pass the test of trial sequential analysis (<LINK REF="FIG-11" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 11</LINK>). However, we have some concerns in regard to indirectness. In the identified trials, virological response was the predominant measure of benefit. Many of the trials measured sustained virological response, which is currently the commonly used non-validated surrogate outcome (<LINK REF="REF-Gluud-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gluud 2007</LINK>). Recent large cohort studies show a correlation between the presence of viraemia and mortality (<LINK REF="REF-Adeel-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Adeel 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hirofumi-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hirofumi 2009</LINK>). However, it is important to remember that sustained virological response (and early virological response and end of treatment virological response) are still only non-validated surrogate outcomes for antiviral intervention effects (<LINK REF="REF-Gluud-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gluud 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Koretz-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Koretz 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gurusamy-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gurusamy 2014</LINK>). We do not know the effects of the interventions on patient-relevant outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-Gluud-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gluud 2007</LINK>). Because randomised clinical trials need to inform clinical practice, patient-relevant outcomes such as risk of liver failure, hepatocellular carcinoma, and mortality would be of greater interest to patients and clinicians. Nevertheless, to be able to report on these outcomes, a much larger sample size and a follow-up of several years would be required. Currently, no randomised clinical trials comparing the two peginterferons are of such a size or duration.</P>
<P>There were serious discrepancies across trials in the meta-analysis on adverse events. The proportions of observed adverse events differed greatly across the trials, and the direction of effect was also heterogeneous. It is noteworthy that the IDEAL trial (<LINK REF="STD-McHutchison-2009" TYPE="STUDY">McHutchison 2009</LINK>) included three intervention groups, one for peginterferon alpha-2a and two for peginterferon alpha-2b. The two peginterferon alpha-2b groups consisted of the usual 1.5 µg/kg/week dose and a low 1.0 µg/kg/week dose. The usual dose group yielded a similar proportion of adverse events as the peginterferon alpha-2a group, whereas the low dose peginterferon alpha-2b group yielded a lower proportion of the group with adverse events. Including or excluding the low dose peginterferon alpha-2b group from the meta-analysis had no visible impact on the estimated adverse events however. Furthermore, the meta-analysis on adverse events leading to treatment discontinuation had low precision. The frequency of all other adverse events varied greatly among the included trials. In the majority of the included trials each patient had at least four to six adverse events during the treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Di-Bisceglie-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Di Bisceglie 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Laguno-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Laguno 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ascione-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Ascione 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rumi-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Rumi 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Miyase-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Miyase 2012</LINK>), but there are some trials where patients experienced no or only one adverse event (<LINK REF="STD-Scotto-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Scotto 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McHutchison-2009" TYPE="STUDY">McHutchison 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kamal-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Kamal 2011</LINK>). Such a discrepancy in reporting adverse events imposes the necessity of uniform reporting of the adverse events in future trials. A post hoc calculation of the required information size to detect a minimally important difference of 10% relative risk reduction, based on the assumption of an average population risk of 10% and employing a 5% maximum type I error and 80% power, suggested that a minimum of 27,000 patients should be randomised to obtain a conclusive meta-analysis on adverse events. The current number of patients in the meta-analysis on adverse events is approximately 5000 (that is, less than 20% of what is required).</P>
<P>There have been some concerns regarding the non-standardisation of the ribavirin dose across trials. The weight-based dose of ribavirin ranged from 800 mg to 1400 mg. However, the weight cut-off varied among trials as well as within the same trial. In the largest included trial (<LINK REF="STD-McHutchison-2009" TYPE="STUDY">McHutchison 2009</LINK>), patients weighing from 40 kg to 65 kg received a lower dose of ribavirin (800 mg) in the peginterferon alpha-2b group compared with a higher dose of ribavirin (1000 mg) in the peginterferon alpha-2a group. Patients in the peginterferon alpha-2b group achieved a lower sustained virological response compared with patients in the peginterferon alpha-2a group (39% versus 41%). Patients weighing more than 105 kg received a higher dose of ribavirin in the peginterferon alpha-2b group (1400 mg) compared with a lower dose of ribavirin (1200 mg) in the peginterferon alpha-2a group. Patients in the peginterferon alpha-2b group achieved a slightly higher sustained virological response compared with patients in the peginterferon alpha-2a group (43% versus 39%) (<LINK REF="STD-McHutchison-2009" TYPE="STUDY">McHutchison 2009</LINK>). It is also interesting that in the same trial, patients who developed anaemia and thus required ribavirin dose reduction achieved a higher sustained virological response than the patients who did not require a ribavirin dose reduction (<LINK REF="STD-McHutchison-2009" TYPE="STUDY">McHutchison 2009</LINK>). Accordingly, we do not think that the varying doses of ribavirin have any major confounding influence on our observations regarding the effects of the type of peginterferon. More research needs to be done to explore the optimal ribavirin dose. A ribavirin dose reduction due to adverse events was reported in only seven trials (<LINK REF="STD-Yenice-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Yenice 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Scotto-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Scotto 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McHutchison-2009" TYPE="STUDY">McHutchison 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ascione-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Ascione 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rumi-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Rumi 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kamal-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Kamal 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Miyase-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Miyase 2012</LINK>). Six of these trials applied one and the same dose reduction to all trial groups (<LINK REF="STD-Yenice-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Yenice 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Scotto-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Scotto 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ascione-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Ascione 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rumi-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Rumi 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kamal-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Kamal 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Miyase-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Miyase 2012</LINK>). Only one trial applied a different ribavirin dose reduction to the intervention groups (<LINK REF="STD-McHutchison-2009" TYPE="STUDY">McHutchison 2009</LINK>). Our estimate did not change noticeably when we excluded the latter trial from our meta-analysis for the outcome sustained virological response. </P>
<P>Selective outcome reporting was difficult to assess in this review. Most of the included trials were not adequately registered or did not have their protocols publicly available<SUP> </SUP>prior to the trial completion. The risk of bias from selective reporting was considered low if the trial protocol was available and all of the pre-specified outcomes that were of interest in the review were reported. It turned out that protocols were not available for all trials but two (<LINK REF="STD-McHutchison-2009" TYPE="STUDY">McHutchison 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kamal-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Kamal 2011</LINK>)<I>. </I>The outcomes reported in the protocols (sustained virological response and adverse events) matched the outcomes that were reported (<LINK REF="STD-McHutchison-2009" TYPE="STUDY">McHutchison 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kamal-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Kamal 2011</LINK>)<I>. </I>We also considered that low risk of reporting bias was present if the trial reported both the sustained virological response and adverse events. However, since the other primary outcomes that were of interest in this review related to morbidity and mortality and were rarely reported in any of the included trials, we could have chosen to assess all the trials as having high risk of reporting bias due to the lack of reporting of important, patient-relevant outcomes. Hopefully, the initiation of the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform coupled with timely and correct registrations of trials will facilitate such assessments for future trials (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2009</LINK>). Another limitation in this review was insufficient reporting of the included trials. Investigators of future trials are, therefore, well advised to adhere to the Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials (SPIRIT) guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-Chan-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chan 2013</LINK>) and the Consolidated Standards for Reporting of Trials (CONSORT) (<LINK REF="REF-Moher-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 2012</LINK>) in order to improve the quality of trial reports.</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2014-02-19 12:12:25 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The strengths of this Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group systematic review are that it builds on a peer-reviewed published protocol (<LINK REF="REF-Awad-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Awad 2010</LINK>), uses extensive searches until October 2013, considers the risks of systematic errors (bias, that is overestimation of benefits and underestimation of harms), and considers risks of random errors (play of chance) by adjusting the threshold for statistical significance according to the information and strength of evidence in the cumulative meta-analysis.</P>
<P>A possible limitation is the unavailability of full reports of all the included trials. Two out of the 12 trials that provided data on sustained virological response for the meta-analysis are only available as abstracts. However, we were able to successfully retrieve the necessary data for one of the two abstracts via e-mail correspondence with the authors, and thus the risk of bias assessment of the included trial was carried out satisfactorily. Our sensitivity analyses did not show any important changes in our results whether including or excluding the trials. In our review, the trials that were published as a full paper are large and dominated the meta-analysed estimates of effects. Moreover, empirical evidence suggests that trials that fail to refute the null hypothesis have lower odds of getting published, especially those not funded by industry (<LINK REF="REF-Als_x002d_Nielsen-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Als-Nielsen 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lee-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lee 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hopewell-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hopewell 2009</LINK>). Thus, many of the included abstracts may have a low probability of getting published as full articles. In fact, including these abstracts in our systematic review may likely be a strength rather than a limitation. By including abstracts we consider the complete available body of evidence. By excluding abstracts we would only obtain a subset that is defined through present-day biased publication mechanisms. This would considerably increase the likelihood of publication bias. These potential limitations and concerns may lower our confidence in the estimates of intervention effect. However, in our meta-analysis of sustained virological response there is no apparent heterogeneity (I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 0%) and the direction of the treatment effect is the same across all included trials. Further research is unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of the effect. It is a common misconception that large randomised trials are generally more reliable than meta-analyses. The reason this misconception has prevailed is due to a number of highly cited papers that compared large trials with low risk of bias to meta-analyses of small trials with high risk of bias. This is of course an unfair comparison. In empirical studies where large trials with low risk of bias are compared to a meta-analysis of small trials with low risk of bias, the results from the two are typically non-discrepant. In the case of the IDEAL trial (<LINK REF="STD-McHutchison-2009" TYPE="STUDY">McHutchison 2009</LINK>), the results still show an effect, albeit small, in favour of peginterferon alpha-2a. There are many examples of large trials that, merely by the play of chance, underestimate (or overestimate) the true treatment effect.<BR/>

Six meta-analyses that were published as full papers (<LINK REF="REF-Alavian-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alavian 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zhao-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhao 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Singal-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Singal 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Druyits-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Druyits 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Flori-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Flori 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Yang-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yang 2013</LINK>) also uniformly report the superior efficacy of pegylated interferon alpha-2a over pegylated interferon alpha-2b while the safety profile remains similar for both treatments. Two meta-analyses are not comparable to ours because of the different search strategy and inclusion criteria in one (<LINK REF="REF-Druyits-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Druyits 2012</LINK>) and because non-randomised trials were included for assessment of benefits in the other (<LINK REF="REF-Flori-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Flori 2013</LINK>). The authors did not assess the risk of bias of the included trials (<LINK REF="REF-Druyits-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Druyits 2012</LINK>). The other four meta-analyses have similar search strategies and outcomes as ours but included both fewer trials and smaller number of patients (<LINK REF="REF-Alavian-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alavian 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zhao-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhao 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Singal-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Singal 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Yang-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yang 2013</LINK>). They excluded conference abstracts or limited the participants to only naive patients. The conclusions of those three meta-analyses are in concordance with our conclusions on the higher efficacy of pegylated interferon alpha-2a on sustained virological response and comparable safety profile with pegylated interferon alpha-2b.</P>
<P>Current evidence suggests that peginterferon alpha-2a is significantly better than peginterferon alpha-2b regarding sustained virological response, which is the clearance of the virus from the blood. However, there is insufficient evidence to detect any differences regarding effects on clinical outcomes (liver complications and mortality) as well as harms (adverse events). Future trials need to study the correlation between sustained virological response and risk of cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, and mortality.</P>

<P>There is lack of evidence on patient-important outcomes such as mortality, liver complications, cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, and quality of life. Both drugs look comparable regarding harms (adverse events), but the reporting of adverse events in trials was insufficient. Moderate quality evidence suggests that peginterferon alpha-2a is superior to peginterferon alpha-2b in achieving a sustained virological response. However, sustained virological response is still an unvalidated surrogate outcome for patient-important outcomes. The lack of evidence on patient-important outcomes and the paucity of evidence on adverse events means we are unable to draw definitive conclusions about the effects of one peginterferon over the other.</P>

<LI>We redefined the 'Risk of bias' subgroup analysis as analysis between trials that are assessed to be at a low or high risk of bias instead of trials that are assessed to be at a low, unclear, or high risk of bias. This is in accordance with the recommendation from the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>) and previous research on the topic (<LINK REF="REF-Wood-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wood 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Savovic-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Savovic 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Savovic-2012a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Savovic 2012a</LINK>).</LI>
<LI>We changed the outcome failure of sustained virological response into sustained virological response for ease of interpretation.</LI>
<LI>We changed the sequence of outcomes in accordance with recommendations in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). We decided to change the outcomes in order to give priority to the outcomes which are of greater interest for patients and clinicians such as liver-related morbidity, liver-related mortality, all-cause mortality, and quality of life instead of unvalidated surrogate outcomes such as sustained virological response. We reported the primary and secondary outcomes. As randomised clinical trials need to inform clinical practice, clinical outcomes such as risk of liver failure, hepatocellular carcinoma, and mortality would be of greater interest to patients and clinicians, but unfortunately these data are lacking in the current literature.</LI>
<LI>A Summary of Findings table was constructed, rating the evidence on the review outcomes.</LI>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">The original protocol outcomes were as follows.</HEADING>
<P>Primary outcome</P>
<P>1. Failure of sustained virological response: number of patients with detectable hepatitis C virus RNA in serum by sensitive test six months later.<BR/>2. Liver-related morbidity plus all-cause mortality: number of patients who developed cirrhosis, ascites, variceal bleeding, hepatic encephalopathy, hepatocellular carcinoma, or died.<BR/>3. Adverse events: number of patients with any untoward medical occurrence not necessarily having a causal relationship with the treatment. We will report on adverse events that lead to treatment discontinuation and those that have not lead to treatment discontinuation separately. We have defined serious adverse events according to the International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) Guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-ICH_x002d_GCP-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">ICH-GCP 1997</LINK>) as any event that leads to death, is life-threatening, requires in-patient hospitalisation or prolongation of existing hospitalisation, results in persistent or significant disability, and any important medical event, which may have jeopardised the patient or requires intervention to prevent it. All other adverse events will be considered non-serious.</P>
<P>Secondary outcomes</P>
<P>1. Failure of end of treatment virological response: number of patients with detectable hepatitis C virus RNA at the end of treatment.<BR/>2. Failure of early virological response: number of patients with detectable hepatitis C virus RNA or without 2 log IU/ml reduction in relation to the baseline amount assessed 12 weeks after the introduction of the treatment.<BR/>3. Failure of biochemical response:number of patients without improvement in the liver enzymes levels (eg, AST and ALT).<BR/>4. Failure of histological response: number of patients without improvement of histology (inflammation score or fibrosis score as defined by the individual trials).<BR/>5. Quality of life as defined in the individual trials.</P>

<SUP>3</SUP>Post hoc required information size calculation based on a 10% risk of adverse events in the peginterferon alpha-2b group, a minimally important difference of 10%, a 5% type I error, and a 80% power, suggests that a minimum of 27,000 patients need to be randomised for a conclusive meta-analysis on adverse events.

<SUP>6</SUP> Reporting of all other adverse events was poor and inconsistent across all included trials. The proportions of observed adverse events differ substantially across the trials, and the direction of effect is heterogeneous. Because the event proportion is relatively low across all trials, all of the included trials may be subject to considerable random errors, thus explaining the apparent heterogeneity in direction of estimates.<BR/>

<P>Trial sequential analysis (TSA): peginterferon alpha-2a versus peginterferon alpha-2b on the outcome serious adverse events.<BR/>The diversity-adjusted required information size of n = 4799 patients was calculated based upon a proportion of 13.0% of patients with serious adverse events in the peginterferon alpha-2b group, a relative risk reduction of 20% in peginterferon alpha-2a group, an alpha (type I error) of 5%, a beta (type II error) of 20%, and a diversity (D) of 0%. The solid blue curve presents the cumulative meta-analysis Z-score and the inward sloping red curves present the two-sided Lan-DeMets trial sequential monitoring boundaries. The cumulative Z-score reaches the area of futility delineated by the two trial sequential monitoring boundaries.</P>

<P>Trial sequential analysis (TSA): peginterferon alpha-2a versus peginterferon alpha-2b on the outcome adverse events leading to treatment discontinuation.<BR/>The diversity-adjusted required information size of n = 12,832 patients was calculated based upon a proportion of 9.0% of patients with treatment discontinuation in the peginterferon alpha-2b group, a relative risk reduction of 20% in peginterferon alpha-2a group, an alpha (type I error) of 5%, a beta (type II error) of 20%, and a diversity (D) of 81%. The solid blue curve presents the cumulative meta-analysis Z-score and the inward sloping red curves present the adjusted threshold for statistical significance according to the two-sided Lan-DeMets trial sequential monitoring boundaries. The cumulative Z-score does not cross any of the monitoring boundaries and does not reach the area of futility delineated by the two trial sequential monitoring boundaries which are not even drawn by the program due to the fact that the distance between the acquired and the required information size is too large.</P>

<P>Trial sequential analysis (TSA): peginterferon alpha-2a versus peginterferon alpha-2b on the outcome sustained virological response. <BR/>The diversity-adjusted required information size of n = 4257 patients was calculated based upon a proportion of 49.6 % of patients with sustained virological response in the peginterferon alpha-2b group, a relative risk reduction of a 10% in peginterferon alpha-2a group, an alpha (type I error) of 5%, a beta (type II error) of 10%, and a diversity (D) of 51%. The solid blue curve presents the cumulative meta-analysis Z-score and the inward sloping red curves present the adjusted threshold for statistical significance according to the two-sided Lan-DeMets trial sequential monitoring boundaries. The cumulative Z-score reaches the area of futility (delineated by the two trial sequential monitoring boundaries), but then it crosses both the conventional significance boundary (two tailed P = 0.05) and the trial sequential monitoring boundary.</P>

<P>Trial sequential analysis (TSA): peginterferon alpha-2a versus peginterferon alpha-2b on the two subgroup analysis sustained virological response in participants infected with hepatitis C genotype 1 and 4. <BR/>The diversity-adjusted required information size of n = 6375 patients was calculated based upon a proportion of 44.9% of patients with sustained virological response in the peginterferon alpha-2b group, a relative risk reduction of a 10% in peginterferon alpha-2a group, an alpha (type I error) of 5%, a beta (type II error) of 10%, and a diversity (D) of 45%. The solid blue curve presents the cumulative meta-analysis test Z-score and the inward sloping red curves present the two-sided Lan-DeMets trial sequential monitoring boundaries. The cumulative Z-score almost reaches the area of futility (delineated by the two trial sequential monitoring boundaries), but then it crosses both the conventional significance boundary (two tailed P = 0.05 ) and the trial sequential monitoring boundary.</P>

<P>Trial sequential analysis (TSA): peginterferon alpha-2a versus peginterferon alpha-2b on the two subgroup analysis sustained virological response in patients infected with hepatitis C genotype 2 and 3.The diversity-adjusted required information size of n = 1113 patients was calculated based upon a proportion of 81.4% of patients with sustained virological response in the peginterferon alpha-2b group, a relative risk reduction of a 10% in peginterferon alpha-2a group, an alpha (type I error) of 5%, a beta (type II error) of 10%, and a diversity (D) of 0%. The solid blue curve presents the cumulative meta-analysis Z-score and the inward sloping red curves present the two-sided Lan-DeMets trial sequential monitoring boundaries. The cumulative Z-score does not reach the area of futility (delineated by the two trial sequential monitoring boundaries), but it crosses the conventional significance boundary (two tailed P = 0.05). However, the cumulative Z-score does not cross the trial sequential monitoring boundary.</P>

<P>Trial sequential analysis (TSA): peginterferon alpha-2a versus peginterferon alpha-2b on the subgroup analysis on the outcome sustained virological response in trials with low risk of randomisation bias.<BR/>The diversity-adjusted required information size of n = 5,624 patients was calculated based upon a proportion of 42.4 % of patients with sustained virological response in the peginterferon alpha-2b group, a relative risk reduction of a 10% in peginterferon alpha-2a group, an alpha (type I error) of 5%, a beta (type II error) of 10%, and a diversity (D) of 71%. The solid blue curve presents the cumulative meta-analysis Z-score which reaches the area of futility (delineated by the two trial sequential monitoring boundaries), but then crosses both the conventional significance boundary (two tailed P = 0.05 not shown on the figure) and the trial sequential monitoring boundary.</P>

<P>Trial sequential analysis (TSA): peginterferon alpha-2a versus peginterferon alpha-2b on the subgroup analysis on the outcome sustained virological response in trials with low risk of blinding bias.<BR/>The diversity-adjusted required information size of n = 2079 patients was calculated based upon a proportion of 68% of patients with sustained virological response in the peginterferon alpha-2b group, a relative risk reduction of a 10% in peginterferon alpha-2a group, an alpha (type I error) of 5%, a beta (type II error) of 10%, and a diversity (D) of 0%. The solid blue curve presents the cumulative meta-analysis Z-score and the inward sloping red curves present the two-sided Lan-DeMets trial sequential monitoring boundaries. The trial sequential monitoring boundaries were not broken by the cumulative Z-curve.</P>
