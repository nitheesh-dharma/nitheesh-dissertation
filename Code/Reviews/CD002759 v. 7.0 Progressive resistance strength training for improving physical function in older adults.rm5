<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2009-05-12 10:43:35 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Lindsey Elstub">
<P>Older people generally lose muscle strength as they age. This reduction in muscle strength and associated weakness means that older people are more likely to have problems carrying out their daily activities and to fall. Progressive resistance training (PRT) is a type of exercise where participants exercise their muscles against some type of resistance that is progressively increased as their strength improves. The exercise is usually conducted two to three times a week at moderate to high intensity by using exercise machines, free weights, or elastic bands.This review sets out to examine if PRT can help to improve physical function and muscle strength in older people.</P>
<P>Evidence from 121 randomised controlled trials (6,700 participants) shows that older people who exercise their muscles against a force or resistance become stronger. They also improve their performance of simple activities such as walking, climbing steps, or standing up from a chair more quickly. The improvement in activities such as getting out of a chair or stair climbing is generally greater than walking speed. Moreover, these strength training exercises also improved older people's physical abilities, including more complex daily activities such as bathing or preparing a meal. PRT also reduced pain in people with osteoarthritis. There was insufficient evidence to comment on the risks of PRT or long term effects.

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2009-05-12 10:43:07 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Lindsey Elstub">
<P>One hundred and twenty one trials with 6700 participants were included. In most trials, PRT was performed two to three times per week and at a high intensity. PRT resulted in a small but significant improvement in physical ability (33 trials, 2172 participants; SMD 0.14, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.22). Functional limitation measures also showed improvements: e.g. there was a modest improvement in gait speed (24 trials, 1179 participants, MD 0.08 m/s, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.12); and a moderate to large effect for getting out of a chair (11 trials, 384 participants, SMD -0.94, 95% CI -1.49 to -0.38). PRT had a large positive effect on muscle strength (73 trials, 3059 participants, SMD 0.84, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.00). Participants with osteoarthritis reported a reduction in pain following PRT(6 trials, 503 participants, SMD -0.30, 95% CI -0.48 to -0.13). There was no evidence from 10 other trials (587 participants) that PRT had an effect on bodily pain. Adverse events were poorly recorded but adverse events related to musculoskeletal complaints, such as joint pain and muscle soreness, were reported in many of the studies that prospectively defined and monitored these events. Serious adverse events were rare, and no serious events were reported to be directly related to the exercise programme.</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2009-02-27 16:03:26 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Helen HG Handoll">
<P>This review provides evidence that PRT is an effective intervention for improving physical functioning in older people, including improving strength and the performance of some simple and complex activities. However, some caution is needed with transferring these exercises for use with clinical populations because adverse events are not adequately reported.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2009-05-10 09:31:59 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Lindsey Elstub">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2009-05-07 12:21:46 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Helen HG Handoll">
<P>Muscle strength is the amount of force produced by a muscle. The loss of muscle strength in old age is a prevalent condition. Muscle strength declines with age such that, on average, the strength of people in their 80s is about 40% less than that of people in their 20s (<LINK REF="REF-Doherty-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Doherty 1993</LINK>). Muscle weakness, particularly of the lower limbs, is associated with reduced walking speed (<LINK REF="REF-Buchner-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Buchner 1996</LINK>), increased risk of disability (<LINK REF="REF-Guralnik-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guralnik 1995</LINK>) and falls in older people (<LINK REF="REF-Tinetti-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tinetti 1986</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2009-01-13 11:35:17 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Lindsey Elstub">
<P>Progressive resistance training (PRT) is often used to increase muscle strength. During the exercise, participants exercise their muscles against some type of resistance that is progressively increased as strength improves. Common equipment used for PRT includes exercise machines, free weights, and elastic bands.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2009-05-10 09:31:59 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Lindsey Elstub">
<P>Contrary to long held beliefs, the muscles of older people (i.e. people aged 60 years and older) continue to be adaptable, even into the extremes of old age (<LINK REF="STD-Frontera-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Frontera 1988</LINK>). Trials have revealed that older people can experience large improvements in their muscle strength, particularly if their muscles are significantly overloaded during training (<LINK REF="STD-Brown-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Brown 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Charette-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Charette 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fiatarone-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Fiatarone 1994</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2009-04-02 21:29:28 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Despite evidence of benefit from PRT in terms of improving muscle strength, there is still uncertainty about how these effects translate into changes in substantive outcomes such a reduction in physical disability (<LINK REF="STD-Chandler-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Chandler 1998</LINK>). Most studies have been under-powered to determine the effects of PRT on these outcomes or have included PRT as part of a complex intervention. In addition, there is uncertainty about the effects of PRT when more pragmatic, home or hospital-based programmes are used, and the safety and effectiveness of this intervention in older adults who have health problems and/or functional limitations. Finally, there is uncertainty about the relative benefits of PRT compared with other exercise programmes, or the effectiveness of varying doses of PRT (i.e. programmes of varying intensity and duration). This update of our review (<LINK REF="REF-Latham-2003a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Latham 2003a</LINK>) has continued to assess and summarise the evidence for PRT.</P>

</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2009-02-25 14:54:35 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>To determine the effects of progressive resistance strength training (PRT) on physical function in older adults through comparing PRT with no exercise, or another type of care or exercise (e.g. aerobic training). Comparisons of different types (e.g. intensities, frequencies, or speed) of PRT were included also. We considered these effects primarily in terms of measures of physical (dis)ability and adverse effects, and secondary measures of functional impairment (muscle strength &amp; aerobic capacity) and limitation (e.g. gait speed).<BR/>

<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS MODIFIED="2009-05-07 12:48:11 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Helen HG Handoll">
<P>Any trial that had one group of participants who received PRT as a primary intervention was considered for inclusion. PRT was defined as a strength training programme in which the participants exercised their muscles against an external force that was set at specific intensity for each participant, and this resistance was adjusted throughout the training programme. The type of resistance used included elastic bands or tubing (i.e. therabands), cuff weights, free weights, isokinetic machines or other weight machines. This type of training could take place in individual or group exercise programmes, and in a home-based or gymnasium/clinic setting. Studies that utilised only isometric exercises were excluded. Studies that included balance, aerobic or other training as part of the exercise intervention (and not simply part of the warm-up or cool-down) were also excluded.</P>
<P>We found the following comparisons between groups in the trials:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>PRT versus no exercise (greatest difference between groups was expected)</LI>
<LI>Different types of PRT: high intensity versus low intensity, high frequency versus low frequency, or higher speed (power training) versus regular speed (greatest effect expected in the higher intensity groups). Power training refers to the type of PRT that emphasizes speed.</LI>
<LI>PRT versus regular care (including regular therapy or exercise)</LI>

<CRIT_OUTCOMES_PRIMARY MODIFIED="2009-01-13 11:36:36 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Lindsey Elstub">
<P>This review assessed physical function in older adults at the level of impairment, functional limitation and disability. The primary outcome of this review was physical disability. This was assessed as a continuous variable. The outcomes were categorized based on the Nagi model of health states (<LINK REF="REF-Nagi-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nagi 1991</LINK>). In this model, disability is considered to be a limitation in performance of socially defined roles and tasks that can relate to self-care, work, family etc. In this review, the primary assessment of physical disability included the evaluation of self-reported measures of activities of daily living (ADL, i.e. the Barthel Index) and the physical domains of health-related quality of life (HRQOL, i.e. the physical function domain of the SF-36). Data from these measures were pooled for the main analysis of physical disability. However, because these two types of measures (ADL and physical domains of HRQOL) evaluate different health concepts, they were also evaluated in separate analyses. The Nagi model also includes firstly, the domain of 'functional limitations' which are limitations in performance at the level of the whole person and includes activities such as walking, climbing or reaching, and secondly, 'impairments' that are defined as anatomical or physiological abnormalities.</P>
<P>Since the protocol of this review was written, the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Handicap (ICF) has been released (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2001</LINK>). Under this system, disability is an umbrella term for impairments, activity limitations and participation restrictions. Using the ICF, the outcome measures evaluated in this review fall under the domains of impairments, limitations in simple activities (similar to 'functional limitations' in Nagi's system) and limitations in complex activities (similar to some aspects of disability in Nagi's model).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Outcomes removed after the protocol</HEADING>
<P>In the original protocol for this review, measures of fear of falling and participation in social activities were also included as outcomes. However, when the size and complexity of this review became apparent, the authors decided to limit this review to assessments of physical disability as this was the prespecified primary aim of the review. Therefore, these outcomes are not included in the current review. In addition, the protocol also stated that assessments of disability using the Barthel Index and Functional Independence Measure (FIM) would be dichotomised. However, as no trials included the FIM as an outcome and only three trials used the Barthel Index, the decision was made to report these data as continuous outcomes only.</P>

<P>For this update (Issue 3, 2009), one author (CJL) conducted the searches. Both listed authors (CJL, NL) reviewed the titles, descriptors or abstracts identified from all literature searches to identify potentially relevant trials for full review. A copy of the full text of all trials that appeared to be potentially suitable for the review was obtained. Both authors independently used previously defined inclusion criteria to select the trials. In all cases, the reviewers reached a consensus when they initially disagreed about the inclusion of a trial. Before this update, the same method of identifying and assessing studies was used, although other members of the previous review team assisted (<LINK REF="REF-Latham-2003a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Latham 2003a</LINK>).</P>

<P>Two authors independently extracted the data and recorded information on a standardised paper form. They considered all primary and secondary outcomes. If the data were not reported in a form that enabled quantitative pooling, the authors were contacted for additional information.

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2009-04-02 21:37:43 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The methodological quality of each trial was independently assessed by two authors (NL, CS in the first review; CJL, NL in the update) using a scoring system that was based on the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group's former evaluation tool. The review authors were blinded to the trial authors' institution, journal that the trial was published in and the results of the trial. A third review author (CA) was consulted in the first review if a consensus about the trial quality could not be reached. No third review author was involved in the review update. The criteria for assessing internal and external validity can be found in <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>.</P>

<DATA_SYNTHESIS MODIFIED="2009-04-02 21:38:12 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Where it was thought appropriate, the results from the studies were combined. Data synthesis was carried out using MetaView in Review Manager version 5.0. For continuous outcomes, mean differences (MD) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated when similar measurement units were used. To pool outcomes using different units, standardised units (i.e. standardised mean differences, SMD) were created as appropriate. We calculated risk ratios and 95% CI for dichotomous outcomes, where possible.

<P>If minimal statistical heterogeneity (P &lt; 0.1) existed, fixed-effect meta-analysis was performed.</P>
<P>For trials that compared two or more different dosages of PRT versus a control group, data from the higher or highest intensity group were used in the analyses of PRT versus control.</P>

<P>If substantial statistical heterogeneity existed, the review authors looked for possible explanations. Specifically, we considered differences in age and baseline disability of the study participants, the methodological quality of the trials and the intensity and duration of the interventions. If the statistical heterogeneity could be explained, we considered the possibility of presenting the results as subgroup analyses. If the statistical heterogeneity could not be explained, we considered not combining the studies at all, using a random-effects model with cautious interpretation or using both fixed-effect and random-effects models to assist in explaining the uncertainty around an analysis with heterogeneous studies.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Intensity</HEADING>
<P>The resistance training programmes in most trials (i.e. 83 trials) involved high intensity training. Most of these trials used specialized exercise machines for training. Thirty-six trials used low-intensity to moderate-intensity training, with most using elastic tubing or bands. All of the high-intensity training was carried out at least in part in gym or clinic based settings, with the exception of two published trials (<LINK REF="STD-Baker-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Baker 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Latham-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Latham 2003</LINK>) and a trial published as an abstract (<LINK REF="STD-Fiatarone-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Fiatarone 1997</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Frequency and duration</HEADING>
<P>The frequency of training was consistent across studies, with the exercise programme carried out two to three times a week in almost all trials. Two exceptions to this were the two trials conducted in hospital which carried out the exercises on a daily basis (<LINK REF="STD-Donald-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Donald 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Latham-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Latham 2001</LINK>). In contrast, there was large variation in the duration of the exercise programmes and the number of exercises performed in each programme. Although most of the programmes (i.e. 71 trials) were eight to 12 weeks long, the duration ranged from two to 104 weeks. In 54 trials the exercise programme was longer than 12 weeks. The number of exercises performed also varied, from one to more than 14.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Adherence</HEADING>
<P>Data about adherence to the PRT programme are reported in the '<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>'. These data are difficult to interpret because different definitions for adherence or compliance were used across the trials. In most trials, adherence referred to the percentage of exercise sessions attended compared with the total number of prescribed sessions and in this case the reported adherence rate is high (i.e. greater than 75%). Many trials only included participants that completed the entire trial (i.e. excluded drop-outs), while some trials reported these data with drop-outs included.</P>

<P>Eleven studies did not report final means and standard deviations for some or all of their outcome measures but instead reported baseline mean scores and mean change in scores from baseline (<LINK REF="STD-Baum-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Baum 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bean-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Bean 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Buchner-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Buchner 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chandler-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Chandler 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fiatarone-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Fiatarone 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hiatt-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Hiatt 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jette-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Jette 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lamoureux-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Lamoureux 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Madden-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Madden 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sullivan-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Sullivan 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Topp-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Topp 1996</LINK>).

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Measures of physical (dis)ability/HRQOL (complex physical activities)</HEADING>
<P>The main function (disability) measures from trials that had appropriate data were pooled using the standardised mean difference (SMD) and a fixed-effect model. Because studies measured function in scales with different directions, a higher score indicates either less disability/better function or more disability/poor function, a transformation was conducted to make all the scales point in the same direction. Mean values from trials in which a higher score indicates more disability/poor function were multiplied by -1. There is a significant effect of PRT in decreasing disability (<I>see</I> <LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>
: 33 trials, 2172 participants; SMD 0.14, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.22). When the physical function domain of SF-36 or SF-12 was pooled from 14 studies (n = 778) using a fixed-effect model, no difference was found (<LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>
: SMD 0.07, 95% CI -0.08 to 0.21). No difference was found from the pooled results of three trials for activity of daily living measures (<LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>).
 A number of studies had function measures (i.e. measures of activity, function or HRQOL) that could not be pooled. The available data from these measures are reported in <LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK>.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Strength</HEADING>
<P>Many different muscle groups were tested and a number of methods were used to evaluate muscle strength in these trials. To minimise clinical heterogeneity, data were pooled from one muscle group. The leg extensor group of muscles was selected since this group was the most frequently evaluated. The effect size was calculated using standardised mean difference (SMD) to allow the pooling of data that used different units of measurement. Seventy-three studies involving 3059 participants reported the effect of resistance training on a lower-limb extensor muscle group and provided data that allowed pooling. A moderate-to-large beneficial effect was found (<LINK REF="CMP-001.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.5</LINK>: SMD 0.84, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.00, random-effects model; fixed-effect model: SMD 0.53, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.61).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Supplementary analyses</HEADING>
<P>Significant statistical heterogeneity was apparent in these data (P &lt; 0.0001). Since a large number of studies assessed this outcome, it was possible to explore this heterogeneity by stratifying the data. Differences in treatment effects due to the quality of the trials were investigated. We also explored subgroups of trials that were based on the design of the treatment programmes and the characteristics of the participants.</P>
<P>To explore the effect of data quality on treatment effects, data were stratified by four design features that are associated with internal validity. These are allocation concealment; blinded assessors; intention-to-treat analysis (ITT); and attention control groups. The fixed-effect model was used throughout in order to obtain the results for the test for subgroup differences. The effect was smaller in the few studies with clear allocation concealment (6 trials, 607 participants) compared with studies with unknown concealment of allocation (67 trials, 2452 participants): <LINK REF="CMP-010.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 10.1</LINK>: test for subgroup differences: Chi = 32.69, df = 1 (P &lt; 0.00001). The effect was also smaller in studies that used blinded assessors (19 trials, 1523 participants) compared with studies that did not use blinded assessors (54 trials, 1536 participants): 
<LINK REF="CMP-010.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 10.2</LINK>: test for subgroup differences: Chi = 70.56, df = 1 (P &lt; 0.00001). This was also true for studies that used intention-to-treat analysis (ITT) (12 trials, 1041 participants) versus no ITT (61 trials, 2018 participants): <LINK REF="CMP-010.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 10.3</LINK>: test for subgroup differences: Chi = 49.74, df = 1 (P &lt; 0.00001). It is noticable that trials that applied better design features tend to be the larger trials. The effect was smaller when attention control groups were used (attention control: 24 studies, 1408 participants, no attention control: 49 studies, 1651 participants): <LINK REF="CMP-010.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 10.4</LINK>: test for subgroup differences: Chi = 25.04, df = 1 (P &lt; 0.00001).</P>
<P>Subgroup analyses were conducted to explore the effect of PRT when the design of the exercise programme and the characteristics of the participants differed. The effect of differences in the exercise programme was explored by examining effect estimates in studies that used different intensity and duration. High intensity strength training was compared with low to moderate intensity training. This analysis suggests that while both training approaches are probably effective in improving strength, higher intensity training (54 trials, 2026 participants) has a larger effect on strength than low to moderate intensity training (19 trials, 1033 participants): <LINK REF="CMP-010.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 10.5</LINK>: test for subgroup differences: Chi = 7.24, df = 1 (P = 0.007). Longer duration programmes (i.e. greater than 12 weeks) were also compared with shorter duration programmes (less than 12 weeks). The duration of the trial appeared to have minimal effect on the strength outcome (&lt; 12 weeks: 20 trials, 828 participants; &gt; 12 weeks: 36 trials, 1736 participants): <LINK REF="CMP-010.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 10.6</LINK>: test for subgroup differences: Chi = 0.04, df = 1 (P = 0.85).</P>
<P>Treatment effects in older people with and without a chronic disease (or functional limitation) were also assessed. Again, resistance training appeared to be effective in improving strength in both groups of older people, but there was statistical heterogeneity in the effects. Studies that included participants who had specific health problems and/or functional limitations were compared with studies that included only healthy older people. The effect in older adults who were healthy has a larger effect size than older adults with specific health problems (healthy older adults: 46 trials, 1502 participants; older adults with specific health problems: 19 trials, 926 participants): <LINK REF="CMP-010.07" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 10.7</LINK>: test for subgroup differences: Chi = 19.85, df = 1 (P &lt; 0.00001). In addition, PRT in studies that included older adults who had a physical disability or functional limitation appeared to be less effective than in those that included older adults who did not have functional limitations (people with functional limitations: 13 studies, 784 participants; people with no functional limitations: 41 studies, 1349 participants): <LINK REF="CMP-010.08" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 10.8</LINK>: test for subgroup differences: Chi = 29.33, df = 1 (P &lt; 0.00001). However, this result could be confounded by the intensity of the PRT programmes, as almost all programmes that included people with functional limitations were carried out at a low to moderate intensity. There were insufficient data available to compare the results by gender (men only: 5 trials with 107 participants; women only: 15 trials with 486 participants)

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Aerobic capacity</HEADING>
<P>The main measure of aerobic capacity was pooled from 29 studies (n = 1138) using a random-effects model. These results suggest that PRT has a significant effect on aerobic capacity (<LINK REF="CMP-001.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.6</LINK>
: SMD 0.31, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.53). Further analyses were performed for three specific measures of aerobic capacity: VO2 max (ml/kg/min), peak oxygen uptake (L/min) and the six-minute walk test (meters). A consistent significant effect was found for VO2 max (<LINK REF="CMP-001.07" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.7</LINK>: 18 trials, n = 710, MD 1.5 ml/kg/min, 95% CI 0.49 to 2.51). Similarly, a significant positive effect was found for the six-minute walk test (<LINK REF="CMP-001.08" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.8</LINK>

<P>Results from all balance performance measures were pooled using SMD and a fixed-effect model. Data pooled from 17 studies with 996 participants showed a small but non-significant benefit (higher score indicates better balance) for balance (<LINK REF="CMP-001.09" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.9</LINK>
: SMD 0.12 (95% CI 0.00 to 0.25).</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Gait speed</HEADING>
<P>Two different measures of walking speed were used: gait speed (measured in meters per second) and timed walk (i.e. time to walk a set distance, measured in seconds). A higher gait speed score indicates faster mobility, while a higher timed walk score indicates slower mobility. Because of this difference, these data were analyzed separately. Data for gait speed were available from 24 studies that included 1179 participants (<LINK REF="CMP-001.11" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.11</LINK>
: MD 0.08 m/s, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.12, random-effects). This indicated that PRT has a modest but significant beneficial effect on gait speed. Only eight trials measured the timed walk (seconds) as an outcome measure and no evidence of an effect was found (<LINK REF="CMP-001.12" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.12</LINK>
; 204 participants, MD -0.23 seconds, 95% CI -1.07 to 0.62, fixed-effect).</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Timed up-and-go</HEADING>
<P>Timed up-and-go (i.e. time to stand from a chair, walk three meters, turn, and return to sitting, measured in seconds) was analysed using a fixed-effect model. Data, available from 12 trials and a total of 691 participants, showed the PRT group took significantly less time to complete this mobility task (<LINK REF="CMP-001.13" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.13</LINK>: MD -0.69 seconds, 95% CI -1.11 to -0.27).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Timed chair rise</HEADING>
<P>Time to stand up from a sitting position data were available in 11 studies (n = 384). Because different numbers of sit-to-stand were counted, SMD and a random-effects model was used to pool these results. These showed a significant, moderate to large effect on this task in favour of the PRT group (<LINK REF="CMP-001.14" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.14</LINK>: SMD -0.94, 95% CI -1.49 to -0.38).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Stair climbing</HEADING>
<P>Time to climb stairs data, which were available from eight trials, also favoured PRT (<LINK REF="CMP-001.15" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.15</LINK>). However, these results were highly heterogenous.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Falls</HEADING>
<P>Thirteen studies collected data about the effect of resistance training on falls or reported the incident of falls, but the outcomes reported did not allow pooling of the data. The available data is reported in <LINK REF="TBL-04" TYPE="TABLE">Table 4</LINK>. Three of these studies (<LINK REF="STD-Buchner-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Buchner 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fiatarone-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Fiatarone 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Judge-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Judge 1994</LINK>) were part of the FICSIT trial, a prospective preplanned meta-analysis to determine the effectiveness of exercise to prevent falls in older people (<LINK REF="REF-Province-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Province 1995</LINK>). The data were extracted from the main FICSIT paper, because papers published about the individual exercise programmes did not provide useful data about the effect of resistance training alone on falls. One additional trial investigated the effect of resistance training on falls in older people while they were in hospital (<LINK REF="STD-Donald-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Donald 2000</LINK>). Another trial also assessed the effect of PRT on frail older people following discharge from hospital (<LINK REF="STD-Latham-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Latham 2003</LINK>). There is a more comprehensive review of the effect of exercise on falls in a separate Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-Gillespie-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gillespie 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>With the exception of <LINK REF="STD-Latham-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Latham 2003</LINK>, all of these trials were small (i.e. less than 80 participants in the resistance training and control groups). Only <LINK REF="STD-Donald-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Donald 2000</LINK> found a significant reduction in falls, but there were few fall events in this trial.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Vitality</HEADING>
<P>The vitality (VT) domain of the SF-36 health status measure was assessed in 10 studies involving 611 participants. For this measure, a higher score indicates better health (i.e. more vitality): there was no evidence of an effect of PRT from the pooled data (<LINK REF="CMP-001.17" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.17</LINK>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Pain</HEADING>
<P>Data of bodily pain (BP) domain of the SF-36 health status measure were provided by 10 studies involving 587 participants. For this measure, a higher score indicates better health (i.e. less pain), there was no evidence that PRT had an effect on bodily pain (<LINK REF="CMP-001.18" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.18</LINK>
: MD 0.34, 95% CI -3.44 to 4.12). In contrast, six studies with 503 participants included pain measures where a higher score indicates more pain, and found evidence to support a modest reduction in pain following PRT (<LINK REF="CMP-001.19" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.19</LINK>
: SMD -0.30, 95% CI -0.48 to -0.13). These six studies all included participants with osteoarthritis and used pain measures designed specifically for this population, which could have increased their sensitivity to change.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Health service use, hospitalization and death</HEADING>
<P>Five studies provided data about hospitalization rates, length of stay and/or outpatient visits. <LINK REF="STD-Donald-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Donald 2000</LINK> reported that people who received PRT in addition to regular in-hospital physiotherapy had a length of stay of 27 days compared with 32 days for the control group. <LINK REF="STD-Latham-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Latham 2003</LINK> found that 42/120 people in the PRT group were admitted to hospital over six months compared to 35/123 in the control group. The third trial by <LINK REF="STD-Singh-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Singh 1997</LINK> reported that, over a 10 week period, people in the PRT group had mean 2.1 (SD 0.4) visits to a health professional and mean 0.24 (SD 0.2) hospital days compared to controls mean of 2.0 (SD 0.5) visits and mean 0.53 (0.4) hospital days. The fourth study by <LINK REF="STD-Singh-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Singh 2005</LINK> reported visits to a health professional over the study (average numbers per person): high intensity group, 2 (2); low intensity group, 2 (1.8); controls, 5 (1.8). The fifth study by <LINK REF="STD-Miller-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 2006</LINK> reported participants' discharge destinations but did not specify the group: 52 participants were discharged to a rehabilitation programme, 12 were transferred to a community hospital, 16 were discharged to higher level care, and 20 returned directly to their pre-injury admission accommodation. An additional study, <LINK REF="STD-Buchner-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Buchner 1997</LINK>, provided data about health service use, but only reported data that were pooled to include participants in aerobic training, combined aerobic training and PRT and PRT alone. This study found no change in hospital admissions between those in the exercise and control groups, but an increased number of outpatient visits by those in the control group. Finally, two studies stated that there was no difference in health care visits (<LINK REF="STD-Fiatarone-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Fiatarone 1997</LINK>) or hospitalization (<LINK REF="STD-Pu-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Pu 2001</LINK>) but no specific data were provided.</P>
<P>Thirteen studies provided data about participant deaths that allowed pooling (<LINK REF="STD-Baum-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Baum 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Boshuizen-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Boshuizen 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chin-A-Paw-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Chin A Paw 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Donald-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Donald 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ettinger-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Ettinger 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fiatarone-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Fiatarone 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kallinen-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Kallinen 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Latham-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Latham 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mangione-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Mangione 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Miller-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moreland-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Moreland 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Newnham-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Newnham 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Selig-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Selig 2004</LINK>).

<P>Five studies evaluated the effect of PRT compared with aerobic training on physical function. Four studies (<LINK REF="STD-Buchner-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Buchner 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Earles-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Earles 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hiatt-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Hiatt 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mangione-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Mangione 2005</LINK>) used outcomes in which a higher score indicates less disability (n = 125), and found no significant difference (see <LINK REF="CMP-006.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 6.1</LINK>: SMD -0.21, 95% CI -0.56 to 0.15; lower score favours the aerobic training group). The other study (<LINK REF="STD-Ettinger-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Ettinger 1997</LINK>) (n = 237) also found no significant difference between the groups for function (see <LINK REF="CMP-006.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 6.2</LINK>: SMD 0.05, 95% CI -0.21 to 0.30; higher score favours aerobic group).</P>

<P>Aerobic capacity was evaluated in eight studies involving 423 participants (<LINK REF="STD-Ballor-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Ballor 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Buchner-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Buchner 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ettinger-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Ettinger 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hepple-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Hepple 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hiatt-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Hiatt 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kallinen-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Kallinen 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Madden-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Madden 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pollock-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Pollock 1991</LINK>). This was measured using VO2 max in ml/kg/min.

<HEADING LEVEL="4">PRT versus balance</HEADING>
<P>One study (<LINK REF="STD-Judge-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Judge 1994</LINK>) compared PRT with balance retraining (n = 55). This study found that strength improved in the PRT group, but not in the balance training group. Chair rise time and gait speed did not improve in any group, with gait speed actually declining in the balance training group. However, balance improved in the balance training group compared with the PRT group.</P>

</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Adverse events</HEADING>
<P>Among 121 studies that were reviewed, 53 studies provided no comment at all about adverse events associated with the training programme. Of the remaining 68 studies, 25 reported no adverse events and 43 reported some adverse reaction to the exercise programme. An additional eight studies did not report adverse events as such, but it is possible that an event occurred since these studies reported drop-outs from the exercise group secondary to increasing pain or specific injuries (<LINK REF="STD-Chandler-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Chandler 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Charette-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Charette 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fiatarone-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Fiatarone 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hagerman-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Hagerman 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hortobagyi-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Hortobagyi 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jette-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Jette 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Maurer-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Maurer 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Topp-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Topp 1993</LINK>). Given that there were considerably more drop-outs from the PRT group than from the control group (see methodological quality section above), it is possible that the number of cases of adverse events reported here are an underestimate.</P>
<P>Only nine studies provided an a priori definition of an adverse event in the study methods or objectives (<LINK REF="STD-Earles-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Earles 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ettinger-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Ettinger 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Judge-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Judge 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kallinen-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Kallinen 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Latham-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Latham 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Liu_x002d_Ambrose-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Liu-Ambrose 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moreland-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Moreland 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pollock-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Pollock 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Singh-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Singh 1997</LINK>). Eight of these nine studies detected adverse events (<LINK REF="STD-Earles-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Earles 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ettinger-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Ettinger 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Judge-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Judge 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kallinen-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Kallinen 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Latham-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Latham 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Liu_x002d_Ambrose-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Liu-Ambrose 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moreland-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Moreland 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pollock-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Pollock 1991</LINK>). However, there was little consistency in the definition that was used, with some studies only reporting serious events that the investigators thought were possibly related to the exercise programme (i.e. <LINK REF="STD-Ettinger-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Ettinger 1997</LINK>) while other studies reported all adverse events that occurred in each group. Most adverse events were musculoskeletal problems. Serious adverse events were rare, and none appeared to be directly related to the exercise programme. One study reported one death of myocardial information in the PRT group (<LINK REF="STD-Kallinen-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Kallinen 2002</LINK>). Another two studies reported one death in the PRT group but the reason of death was not reported (<LINK REF="STD-Baum-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Baum 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chin-A-Paw-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Chin A Paw 2006</LINK>).

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2009-05-11 02:01:27 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review identified, graded and synthesized the available literature regarding the effect of a specific exercise intervention, PRT, on a particular population, older people. To increase the generalisability of these data, the trials included participants with a range of health problems, and the dose and delivery of the PRT programmes varied. This made it possible to assess overall effects of the intervention on older people, with a potential for exploring the effects on subgroups (i.e. in different groups of older people or with different doses of PRT). Overall, this review suggests that PRT has a small but significant effect on improving physical function (complex activities), a small to moderate effect on decreasing some impairments and functional limitations, and a large effect on increasing strength. Adverse events were poorly reported in most studies, which limits the ability of this review to assess the risks associated with this intervention. Additionally, there is some preliminary evidence that suggests that PRT might reduce pain in older people with osteoarthritis. The effect of exercise on reducing pain in people with osteoarthritis is reported in another Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-Brosseau-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brosseau 2003</LINK>). The sparse data did not allow an adequate assessment of the effect of PRT on fall risk. However, a separate Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-Gillespie-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gillespie 2003</LINK>) has reviewed fall prevention.</P>

<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2009-02-27 15:00:05 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Helen HG Handoll">
<P>This review update highlights the fact that exercise training in older adults continues to be a dynamic area of research, with the number of included studies doubling in the five years since the previous review. A quick update extending the MEDLINE search to May 2008 identified nine further studies. However, the majority of the trials continue to be studies with small sample sizes.</P>
<P>This review deliberately used broad inclusion criteria and multiple strategies to try to identify as many studies as possible that used PRT training with older adults. Despite these efforts, given the broad coverage of our review it is inevitable that we have missed some trials. It is particularly challenging to identify unpublished trials in this area because the studies could have been presented at many different types of conferences (stoke, OA, CHD etc). We acknowledge that it was not possible to hand search all of the potential conferences where studies in this area could be presented, and it is therefore possible that we missed some studies that had negative or neutral results and are more difficult to get published. Although we attempted to contact authors when there was any uncertainty about data, it is also likely that data could also have been missed both from the excluded trials (i.e. the outcomes may have been recorded but not reported) and the included trials (i.e. data not reported and/or data not available for pooling).</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2009-04-03 08:01:09 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Helen HG Handoll">
<P>The 121 studies in this review were generally of poor methodological quality, as most of the studies did not use design features that are known to increase internal validity, such as concealed randomisation; intention-to-treat analysis, blinded outcome assessors, or attention control groups. Only 11 studies used concealed randomisation; 22 studies used intention-to-treat analysis; and 33 studies used blinded outcome assessors for all outcomes. Therefore, caution is required when drawing conclusions from these data. When data were stratified by indicators of study quality for the outcome muscle strength, results from the high quality trials continued to support the positive effect of resistance training on strength. However, these data also indicate that low quality trials, usually small studies, that comprise the majority of the studies in the review probably overestimate the effect of resistance training because of random chance effects from small studies. The long-term outcome of PRT is unclear because the majority of studies stopped following up participants once the intervention had ended.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">PRT versus control</HEADING>
<P>PRT shows small positive effect on measures of physical function (disability). PRT also appears to have a positive effect on aerobic capacity and most measures of functional limitations, including gait speed, timed "Up-and-Go" and, the time to stand up from a chair. All of these effects were statistically significant, although the effect sizes tended to be small to moderate, and the clinical significance of these effects is unclear. PRT appears to have a large positive effect on strength and aerobic capacity in older people. However, there was a large amount of statistical heterogeneity associated with the estimate in strength. This variation was reduced, but not eliminated, by investigating differences in outcome in different groups of participants, types of intervention and in trials that used different quality indicators. Please note that results from such exploratory analysis are tentative. In exploratory subgroup analyses, it appeared that training intensity has the greatest effect on strength (i.e. high intensity training has a greater effect on strength than lower intensity training), while the duration of the training appears to have a reduced effect. The magnitude of the effect was influenced by participants' health status or functional status. PRT in healthy participants had a greater effect than in those with a chronic disease or functional limitation. In other words, it appeared that people with a pre-existing health condition or with functional limitations had smaller gains in strength. Additionally, men had larger gains in strength than women; although there were fewer trials in men. These subgroup analyses must be interpreted with caution as the number of participants is reduced which decreases the precision of these estimates. In addition, it is possible that study size is a source of heterogeneity, as several of the largest and highest quality trials included people with function limitations and/or lower intensity training programmes, and study quality appears to reduce the effect estimates. Overall, the effect of PRT on function is positive for older adults; although the effect seems diminished when it transfers from muscle strength to functional limitations and disability.
<BR/>

<BR/>It was not possible to pool fall data because falls were reported differently in the five studies that measured this outcome. These data might suggest a trend towards PRT reducing falls, since four of the five studies found that participants in the PRT group had fewer falls than those in the control group. However, the effect of PRT alone on falls is still not clear.</P>
<P>Adverse events were poorly monitored and reported in most of these trials. This makes it difficult to assess the risk of injury or other adverse events associated with resistance training. The finding that several studies reported drop-outs from the exercise programme due to pain or injury, yet failed to report any adverse events, suggests that adverse events might have been under-reported in some trials. This hypothesis is further supported by the finding that the studies with a clear definition of adverse events in their study methods were more likely to detect these events than those with no definition. The large number of drop-outs from the PRT group compared to controls also raises the possibility that people are experiencing adverse effects from PRT that are not identified in these trials. However, it is reassuring that participant's pain and vitality were not affected by PRT, and in fact PRT appeared to decrease pain in people with osteoarthritis. Furthermore, there was no evidence of increased risk of hospitalization. A few studies reported decreased use of health care services in the PRT group. Finally, there were a few reports of serious adverse events (i.e. myocardial infarction or death) in the PRT group but there was no evidence that these events were directly associated with the intervention. There was also no evidence of increased risk of death in the PRT group when compared with the control group.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Comparison of PRT dosage</HEADING>
<P>There are currently few randomised data available to guide the dose and prescription of PRT. Trials investigated different aspects of this issue were all small studies and most were of poor quality. When high intensity training was compared with low intensity training, data from 10 trials show that high intensity training has a greater effect on strength than lower intensity training. Among these 10 trials, three show that high intensity training has a greater effect on aerobic capacity. Eight of the 10 trials were healthy older people who participated in highly supervised, gym-based programmes. Therefore, it is not clear if high intensity PRT is more beneficial than low intensity training in less fit or healthy older people and/or in home or hospital based programmes. Limited evidence are available for exercise frequencies and sets.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">PRT versus other training</HEADING>
<P>Overall, no significant differences were found between the different types of training. When PRT is compared to aerobic training, PRT tended to produced larger gains in strength than aerobic training. However, these two types of training are not different in aerobic capacity. This finding is to be expected, given that the strength outcome is more specific to PRT. There are fewer data available to determine the comparative effect of these types of training on physical disability, but the available data suggest that the two training programmes have a similar effect on this outcome. There are too few data to draw conclusions about other forms of training such as balance or mobility training compared to PRT.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2009-05-07 13:06:26 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Helen HG Handoll">
<P>Doing PRT two to three times a week can improve physical function in older adults, including reducing physical disability, some functional limitations (i.e. balance, gait speed, timed walk, timed 'up-and-go', chair rise; and climbing stairs) and muscle weakness in older people. Therefore, it would appear to be an appropriate intervention for many older people to improve performance of some simple physical tasks. The training also shows a reduction in pain in people with osteoarthritis. However, some caution is warranted with this intervention as in many studies adverse effects have been poorly monitored. Nonetheless, serious adverse events appear to be rare. When used in clinical practice, clinicians should monitor for adverse effects, particularly when older people who might be at higher risk of injury (i.e. frail or recently ill older people) are undertaking PRT. Additionally, there is no information regarding how long these effects can be maintained because the majority of the studies did not follow up the effect after the training had ended.

<P>Substantial updates of reviews such as this one often take a considerable time to prepare and then take through the editorial process. They can therefore seem 'out of date' before publication, particularly in research active areas. However, although an updated search made in May 2008 revealed nine more potentially eligible trials (which await assessment, pending the next update), it is unlikely that the review's main findings will be substantively changed by these.

<BR/>Our secondary outcome measures included gait speed, muscle strength (e.g. one repetition maximum test, isokinetic and isometric dynamometry), balance (e.g. Berg Balance Scale, Functional Reach Test), aerobic capacity, and chair rise. These secondary outcomes were considered well defined if validated and standardised measures were used, and the method of data collection and scoring of any scales was clearly described.</P>
