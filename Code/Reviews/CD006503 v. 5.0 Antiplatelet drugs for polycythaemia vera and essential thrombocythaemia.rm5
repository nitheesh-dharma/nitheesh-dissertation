<P>Low-dose aspirin as an antiplatelet therapy is the drug of choice for preventing cardiovascular events, but the potential risk of bleeding has limited its use in myeloproliferative neoplasms in the past. Evidence from this review of 630 people in two trials suggests that, in patients with polycythaemia vera and with no clear indication or contraindication to aspirin therapy, low-dose aspirin may reduce the risk of thrombotic and all-cause mortality. No data were provided on mortality from bleeding episodes. No studies in participants with essential thrombocythaemia and with antiplatelet therapy other than aspirin have been published.</P>

<P>Polycythaemia vera and essential thrombocythaemia are chronic Philadelphia-negative myeloproliferative neoplasms that increase the risk of arterial and venous thrombosis, as well as bleeding.

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2013-03-09 10:29:18 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), <I>The Cochrane Library</I> (Issue 1 2012), MEDLINE (1966 to 2012), and EMBASE (1980 to 2012), as well as online registers of ongoing trials and conference proceedings. The date of the last search was October 2012.</P>

<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2013-03-09 10:29:18 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing long-term (&gt;6 months) use of an antiplatelet drug versus placebo or no treatment in participants with polycythaemia vera or essential thrombocythaemia, as diagnosed by established international criteria, with data for at least one of the selected outcomes.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2013-03-09 10:29:18 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Using a pre-defined extraction form, two review authors independently screened results, extracted data, and assessed quality. We planned to analyse the following outcomes: mortality from arterial and venous thrombotic events (primary efficacy outcome), mortality from bleeding episodes (primary safety outcome), fatal and non-fatal arterial thrombotic events, fatal and non-fatal venous thrombotic events, micro-circulation events, transient neurological and ocular manifestations, major and minor bleeding episodes, and all-cause mortality and any adverse events. We based quantitative analysis of outcome data on an intention-to-treat principle. We used the pooled odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) with a fixed-effect model (Mantel-Haenszel) to estimate the overall treatment effect.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-03-09 10:29:18 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We identified no new studies from the updated searches. We included in this review two RCTs for a total of 630 participants. Both RCTs included participants with an established diagnosis of polycythaemia vera and with no clear indication or contraindication to aspirin therapy. We judged both studies to be of moderate quality. Published data from both studies were insufficient for a time-to-event data analysis and for some of the primary and secondary outcomes that we planned. The use of low-dose aspirin, compared with placebo, was associated with a lower risk of fatal thrombotic events (although this benefit was not statistically significant (OR 0.20, 95% CI 0.03 to 1.14; P = 0.07). No data on mortality from bleeding episodes were available. A non-significant benefit of aspirin was shown for all-cause mortality (OR 0.46, 95% CI 0.21 to 1.01; P = 0.05). No increase in the risk of major bleeding was reported in participants taking aspirin compared with those given placebo (OR 0.99, 95% CI 0.23 to 4.36; P = 0.99), and a non-significant increase with aspirin treatment was shown for minor bleeding (OR 1.85, 95% CI 0.90 to 3.79; P = 0.09). No published studies have reported findings in participants with essential thrombocythaemia or in the study of other antiplatelet drugs.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2013-03-14 11:40:36 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nicole Skoetz">
<P>Polycythaemia vera and essential thrombocythaemia are chronic Philadelphia-negative myeloproliferative neoplasms, in which a multi-potent haemopoietic stem cell autonomously replicates, independent of physiological stimuli (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2002</LINK>). Both diseases follow a chronic clinical course with increased risk of arterial and venous thrombosis and a 1% to 2% incidence per year of evolution to myelofibrosis with myeloid metaplasia or transformation to acute leukaemia (<LINK REF="REF-GISP-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">GISP 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Passamonti-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Passamonti 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Finazzi-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Finazzi 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Marchioli-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marchioli 2005</LINK>). Also, the risk of bleeding is increased as the result of quantitative and qualitative platelet abnormalities.</P>
<P>The leading symptoms of polycythaemia vera are secondary to increased red cell production and red cell mass. The consequent blood hyperviscosity reduces blood flow velocity and increases the risk of both microvascular and thrombotic complications. The incidence of polycythaemia vera is 2.3 per 100,000 person-years (<LINK REF="REF-Ania-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ania 1994</LINK>). The overall mortality in study participants treated with various regimens was estimated to be 3.5 deaths per 100 persons per year &#8212; almost twice the risk of the general population (ECLAP, European Collaboration on Low-dose Aspirin in Polycythaemia study) (<LINK REF="REF-Marchioli-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marchioli 2005</LINK>). Thrombotic events, haematological transformation, and major bleeding are responsible for 41%, 13%, and 4% of deaths, respectively (<LINK REF="REF-Marchioli-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marchioli 2005</LINK>). Participants are usually stratified into different thrombotic risk categories on the basis of the combination of age, a history of arterial or venous thrombosis, and the presence of other common cardiovascular risk factors (e.g. smoking, diabetes mellitus, congestive heart failure) (<LINK REF="REF-Campbell-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Campbell 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Marchioli-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marchioli 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>The incidence of essential thrombocythaemia is 2.5 per 100,000 person-years (<LINK REF="REF-Mesa-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mesa 1999</LINK>). The hallmark of essential thrombocythaemia is an elevated peripheral platelet count together with excessive proliferation of the megakaryocytes. The occurrence of thrombotic complications is related to platelet count and function but is not dependent on the degree of platelet elevation. In about two thirds of all participants, the clinical course is characterised by the occurrence of minor and major thrombotic or bleeding complications, but in about one third, the disease is benign, and no complications are reported for many years (<LINK REF="REF-Mesa-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mesa 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Passamonti-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Passamonti 2004</LINK>). Similar to polycythaemia vera, thrombotic risk categories can be identified on the basis of age, a history of arterial or venous thrombosis, and the presence of common cardiovascular risk factors (e.g. smoking, hypertension, hypercholesterolaemia) (<LINK REF="REF-Cortelazzo-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cortelazzo 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cortelazzo-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cortelazzo 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Campbell-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Campbell 2005</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2013-03-09 10:29:18 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nicole Skoetz">
<P>In keeping with the estimated individual risk of thrombotic and bleeding complications, different therapeutic strategies are used: phlebotomy for polycythaemia vera or platelet apheresis for essential thrombocythaemia, cytoreductive therapy (e.g. hydroxyurea, anagrelide, interferon-&#945;), and antiplatelet drugs to prevent platelet aggregation (<LINK REF="REF-Campbell-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Campbell 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>Several molecules that inhibit platelet aggregation are currently available in clinical practice, including aspirin, dipyridamole, and the old (ticlopidine, clopidogrel) and the new (prasugrel, ticagrelor) thienopyridines (<LINK REF="REF-ACCP-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">ACCP 2012</LINK>). Aspirin has an antiplatelet effect by inhibiting the production of thromboxane, thienopyridine by inhibiting adenosine diphosphate (ADP) receptor/P2Y12 inhibitors, and dipyridamole by inhibiting the production of thromboxane and by inhibiting the phosphodiesterase enzymes that normally break down cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). In addition to the increased risk of bleeding, major reported adverse events include the following: for aspirin, gastric ulcer and allergic reaction; for thienopyridine, neutropenia, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, and dyspnoea (ticagrelor); and for dipyridamole, headache and dizziness (<LINK REF="REF-ACCP-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">ACCP 2012</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2013-03-14 11:40:46 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nicole Skoetz">
<P>Antiplatelet drugs are commonly used for primary and secondary prevention of arterial thrombosis in patients without myeloproliferative neoplasms. For example, among a wide range of high-risk patients (with acute or previous vascular disease or some other predisposing condition), aspirin prevents 10 to 20 fatal and non-fatal thrombotic events per 1000 patients per year (<LINK REF="REF-ATC-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">ATC 2002</LINK>). There is no reason to suppose a lack of effect of antiplatelet drugs in patients with polycythaemia vera or essential thrombocythaemia. Aspirin has been preferentially used by clinicians and researchers in participants with polycythaemia vera and essential thrombocythaemia because, in these diseases, biosynthesis of thromboxane is increased, and one of the molecular effects of aspirin on platelet aggregation is the reduction of thromboxane biosynthesis (<LINK REF="REF-Landolfi-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Landolfi 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rocca-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rocca 1995</LINK>). However, other antiplatelet drugs are currently used in daily practice, in particular when aspirin is contraindicated (<LINK REF="REF-Alvarez_x002d_Larran-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alvarez-Larran 2010</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2013-03-14 15:15:03 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>It is important to assess the actual beneficial effects of antiplatelet drugs. As has been stated, different underlying pathophysiological mechanisms of arterial and venous thrombosis among patients with and without myeloproliferative neoplasms may result in different effects of antiplatelet drugs on thrombosis occurrence and survival. Moreover, in myeloproliferative neoplasms, bleeding may occur spontaneously or may be associated with antiplatelet drugs. Bleeding is typically mucocutaneous, with easy bruising and nose and gingival bleeding. Major haemorrhage requiring transfusion is less frequent and generally involves the gastrointestinal tract. Age, disease duration, use of an antiplatelet agent, and a history of bleeding were significantly associated with bleeding events during follow-up (<LINK REF="REF-Marchioli-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marchioli 2005</LINK>). Aspirin is associated with an approximately two-fold increase in the risk of major upper gastrointestinal bleeding (one to two bleeding events per 1000 patients per year), with an absolute excess of haemorrhagic strokes of one to two per 10,000 patients with chronic Philadelphia-negative myeloproliferative neoplasms (<LINK REF="STD-ECLAP-2004" TYPE="STUDY">ECLAP 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Harrison-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harrison 2005</LINK>). Finally, a platelet count greater than 1,500,000/mm<SUP>3 </SUP>is a well-recognised bleeding risk factor (<LINK REF="REF-Campbell-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Campbell 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>Therefore, the aim of this systematic review &#8212; an update of a previously published Cochrane review (Squizzato 2008) &#8212; is to assess the efficacy and safety of antiplatelet drugs in the primary and secondary prevention of thrombotic events in different risk subgroups of participants with polycythaemia vera or essential thrombocythaemia.</P>

<P>We selected studies on the basis of Chapter 7 of the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011a</LINK>). Two review authors (AS, ER) independently selected potentially eligible studies from the search. We rejected studies if one could determine from the title and/or abstract that the study was not suitable for inclusion in this review. We obtained the full text of the study when an article could not be excluded with certainty. We then compared excluded studies, and any disagreement was resolved through discussion between the authors. When necessary, we contacted the trial authors for additional information. To assess agreement between authors on study selection, we used the <I>k</I> statistic, which measures chance-corrected agreement. A <I>k </I>value higher than 0.6 was considered to represent substantial agreement, and values higher than 0.8 almost perfect agreement (<LINK REF="REF-Maclure-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maclure 1987</LINK>).</P>
<P>We extracted the study characteristics using a pre-defined form and included an assessment of quality. We used a consensus meeting to resolve any disagreement in the quality assessment of the trials. The third author (SM) checked assessments for the included studies.</P>

<P>We assessed the methodological quality of selected studies on the basis of Chapter 8 of the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011b</LINK>). We scored each of the following points as 'low,' 'high,' or 'unclear' (where 'low' indicates that the study is less open to bias) and report them in a risk of bias table (<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>; <LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>):</P>
<UL>
<LI>Method of randomisation (selection bias): Methods of randomisation using date of birth, date of admission, hospital numbers, or alternation are not appropriate because they do not allow each study participant to have the same chance of receiving each intervention.</LI>
<LI>Concealment of allocation (indication bias): Adequate measures to conceal allocations include central randomisation; serially numbered, opaque, sealed envelopes; and other descriptions with convincing concealment.</LI>
<LI>Blinding of investigators and participants (performance bias).</LI>
<LI>Blinding of outcome assessment (detection bias).</LI>
<LI>Adequate follow-up (attrition bias): Attrition bias refers to systematic differences between the comparison groups in terms of loss of participants from the study. We will carefully check the reporting of withdrawals, dropouts, protocol deviations, and losses to follow-up. It is adequate when more than 90% of participants have completed follow-up, and when reasons for withdrawals, dropouts, protocol deviations, and losses to follow-up are clearly reported.</LI>

<P>In the pilot study of the Gruppo Italiano Studio Policitemia (GISP), 112 participants with a PVSG diagnosis of polycythaemia vera were randomly assigned to low-dose aspirin (40 mg per day) or to placebo (<LINK REF="STD-GISP-1997" TYPE="STUDY">GISP 1997</LINK>). In keeping with the 'uncertainty principle,' people were eligible if physicians were uncertain whether aspirin was indicated, and were ineligible if physicians were reasonably certain that aspirin was indicated, was not indicated, or was contraindicated. Exclusion criteria included stage III chronic renal failure, active gastrointestinal disease, and a history of a major haemorrhagic episode during the preceding four months. The primary objective of the study was to evaluate safety and tolerability by assessing major haemorrhagic events, compliance with the assigned treatment, and gastric intolerance. Secondary endpoints consisted of the occurrence of acute MI, TIAs, stroke, venous thromboembolism, and acute arterial thrombosis. Aspirin administration was not associated with any bleeding complications. The mean duration of follow-up was 16 months.</P>
<P>In the ECLAP phase III study, 518 participants with a PVSG diagnosis of polycythaemia vera were randomly assigned to low-dose aspirin (100 mg per day) or to placebo (<LINK REF="STD-ECLAP-2004" TYPE="STUDY">ECLAP 2004</LINK>). Participants were eligible if they had no clear indication and no clear contraindication for aspirin treatment, and had no clinically significant co-existing conditions. No age limits were applied. Two pre-defined combined primary efficacy endpoints were composed as follows: first, non-fatal MI, non-fatal stroke, or death from cardiovascular causes; second, non-fatal MI, non-fatal stroke, pulmonary embolism, major venous thrombosis, or death from cardiovascular causes. The secondary endpoints involved the following single events: fatal or non-fatal cerebrovascular events, fatal or non-fatal cardiac events, minor thrombotic complications (including atypical cerebral or visual symptoms of ischaemia, erythromelalgia, and thrombophlebitis), and major and minor thrombotic complications as previously defined. The safety of low-dose aspirin was assessed by examining rates of fatal and non-fatal major haemorrhage (any haemorrhage requiring transfusion, hospitalisation, or both), minor haemorrhage, and any adverse events leading to discontinuation of treatment. Aspirin significantly reduced only the second of the combined endpoints. All-cause mortality and cardiovascular mortality were not reduced significantly. The incidence of major bleeding episodes was not significantly increased in the aspirin group. The study was planned to have a follow-up duration of five years, but as the result of a slow recruitment rate after two years, the study was prematurely stopped. Total follow-up consisted of 1478 person-years, with a minimum of 12 months per participant.</P>

<P>Data from two trials assessing the efficacy of low-dose aspirin in a total of 630 people with polycythaemia vera were available. The primary efficacy outcome in both trials was the sum of fatal arterial and venous thrombotic events.</P>
<P>Published data from both studies were insufficient for a time-to-event data analysis and for some of the planned primary and secondary outcomes. We contacted the corresponding authors of the GISP and ECLAP studies (the same for both studies) for additional data, but they did not provide them. Consequently, we meta-analysed four main outcomes as simple binary endpoints, measuring the OR with 95% CI.</P>
<P>Low-dose aspirin treatment showed a marked benefit in terms of mortality from thrombotic events, although this finding was not statistically significant (OR 0.20, 95% CI 0.03 to 1.14, P = 0.07, fixed-effect model; see <LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK>). In absolute terms, 3 of 1000 participants treated with aspirin had a fatal thrombotic event, compared with 22 participants treated with placebo (risk difference 1.9%, 95% CI 0% to 4%).</P>
<P>A non-significant benefit of aspirin was also shown for all-cause mortality (OR 0.46, 95% CI 0.21 to 1.01; P = 0.05; fixed-effect model; see <LINK REF="FIG-04" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 4</LINK>).</P>
<P>The primary safety outcome in our review was mortality from bleeding, but no data were available. A non-significant increase with aspirin treatment was shown only for minor bleeding (OR 1.85, 95% CI 0.90 to 3.79; P = 0.09; fixed-effect model; see <LINK REF="FIG-05" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 5</LINK>). Major bleeding occurred at a similar incidence in both treatment groups (OR 0.99, 95% CI 0.23 to 4.36; P = 0.99; fixed-effect model; see <LINK REF="FIG-06" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 6</LINK>).</P>
<P>Using a random-effects model for each outcome, we obtained very similar results.</P>
<P>Insufficient data prevented meta-analysis of the following secondary outcomes: MI, unstable angina, ischaemic stroke, TIA, acute peripheral and visceral thromboembolism, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, unusual sites of venous thrombosis (visceral vein thrombosis and cerebral sinus and venous thrombosis), superficial venous thrombosis, erythromelalgia, seizures, migraine, vertigo, tinnitus, scintillating scotomas, amaurosis fugax, and all adverse events (<LINK TAG="CRIT_OUTCOMES_SECONDARY" TYPE="SECTION">Secondary outcomes</LINK>).</P>
<P>Overall, even though no outcome was statistically significant, we would expect 19 fatal thrombotic events (95% CI 0 to 40) to be prevented for every 1000 participants treated with aspirin, without an excess of major bleeding.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-03-09 10:29:18 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nicole Skoetz">
<P>This systematic review of RCTs on the effects of antiplatelet drugs for long-term primary and secondary prophylaxis of arterial and venous thrombotic events in participants with polycythaemia vera or essential thrombocythaemia included two original RCTs. These were designed and performed by the same network of haematologists and included only participants with polycythaemia vera. The experimental antiplatelet agent was low-dose aspirin in both RCTs. Published data from both studies were insufficient for a time-to-event data analysis and for some of the primary and secondary outcomes that we had planned.</P>
<P>Overall, available evidence showed a marked, but not statistically significant, beneficial effect of low-dose aspirin treatment compared with placebo in terms of mortality from thrombotic events and all-cause mortality, with no increase in major bleeding, in participants with polycythaemia vera with no clear indication or contraindication to aspirin.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2013-03-09 10:29:18 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nicole Skoetz">
<P>For correct interpretation of these data, some comments are necessary. We had planned to extract the HRs and associated variances for a time-to-event data meta-analysis. However, the necessary data (such as several single secondary outcomes) were not available in the published articles and could not be obtained from the trial investigators. This means that the overall treatment effect may be estimated with bias. For this reason, we decided to report data as simple binary outcomes and only data from four available efficacy and safety outcomes (mortality from thrombotic events, all-cause mortality, and major and minor bleeding).</P>
<P>We could not perform our planned subgroup analysis. Consequently, results of these meta-analyses are not directly extensible to all thrombotic risk groups of polycythaemic participants. Both RCTs included only participants with no clear indication for aspirin treatment and no clear contraindication to it, and who had no clinically significant co-existing conditions.</P>
<P>Moreover, no studies in participants with essential thrombocythaemia have been published. Given the different natural course of the two diseases, data pertaining to participants with polycythaemia vera are only indirectly applicable to thrombocythaemic participants. Further studies are necessary to clarify the role of antiplatelet therapy in the treatment of patients with these conditions. Unfortunately, no ongoing RCTs that potentially meet our inclusion/exclusion criteria were identified for essential thrombocythaemia.</P>
<P>Aspirin was the only antiplatelet drug that was investigated. Other antiplatelet drugs are currently used daily (<LINK REF="REF-Alvarez_x002d_Larran-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alvarez-Larran 2010</LINK>), but no information for clinical practice can be extrapolated from our systematic review. The only ongoing trial on this topic is a phase II study on the safety and efficacy of clopidogrel and aspirin for the treatment of polycythaemia vera (<LINK REF="STD-ISCLAP" TYPE="STUDY">ISCLAP</LINK>). Lack of research in this area may have two possible explanations: complexity in conducting a trial in rare chronic diseases; and competing trials on new drugs, the Janus kinase 2 inhibitors, for the management of chronic Philadelphia-negative myeloproliferative neoplasms (<LINK REF="REF-Pardanani-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pardanani 2011</LINK>).</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2013-03-09 10:29:18 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nicole Skoetz">
<P>Another limitation is represented by the methodological quality of the included RCTs (<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>). Both studies were well designed (<LINK REF="STD-ECLAP-2004" TYPE="STUDY">ECLAP 2004</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-GISP-1997" TYPE="STUDY">GISP 1997</LINK>). However, they were judged to have a moderate quality because insufficient data were available to exclude an attrition bias.</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2013-03-09 10:29:18 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nicole Skoetz">
<P>An important limit of our meta-analysis is the relevant weight (almost 80%) of the <LINK REF="STD-ECLAP-2004" TYPE="STUDY">ECLAP 2004</LINK> study. However, we decided to meta-analyse data as the <LINK REF="STD-GISP-1997" TYPE="STUDY">GISP 1997</LINK> study had a very similar protocol, and because meta-analysis is particularly useful in rare diseases, such as polycythaemia vera, in which only a limited number of participants can be enrolled.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2013-03-09 10:29:18 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In patients with polycythaemia vera who have no clear indication or contraindication to aspirin therapy, the use of low-dose aspirin, when compared with no treatment, is associated with a statistically non-significant reduction in the risk of fatal thrombotic events and all-cause mortality, without increased risk of major bleeding. Given the available evidence and until new data are published. low-dose aspirin would therefore be the antiplatelet drug of choice.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2013-02-21 21:38:25 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Even though polycythaemia vera and essential thrombocythaemia are rare diseases, further RCTs are necessary to clarify definitively which subgroup of patients may benefit from antiplatelet drugs. Aspirin should be the drug of choice to be tested in future trials. However, other antiplatelet drugs should also be tested to determine whether they are as beneficial and safe as aspirin, as some patients with polycythaemia vera and essential thrombocythaemia may have an absolute contraindication to aspirin (e.g. allergy).</P>

<P>518 people with polycythaemia vera (210 females, 308 males; mean age 61 years: a total of 26 percent of participants were 70 years of age or older). Participants were eligible if they had no clear indication for aspirin treatment and no clear contraindication to it, were able to provide written informed consent, and had no clinically significant co-existing conditions.</P>
</CHAR_PARTICIPANTS>
<CHAR_INTERVENTIONS MODIFIED="2013-03-09 10:29:18 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nicole Skoetz">
<P>Low-dose aspirin, 100 mg per day (N = 253) versus placebo (N = 265). All participants who were recruited received other recommended treatments: Phlebotomy, cytoreductive drugs, and standard cardiovascular drugs were given as required.</P>
</CHAR_INTERVENTIONS>
<CHAR_OUTCOMES MODIFIED="2013-03-09 10:29:18 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Dolores Matthews">
<P>The two pre-defined primary composed efficacy endpoints were: non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, or death from cardiovascular causes; and non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, pulmonary embolism, major venous thrombosis, or death from cardiovascular causes.</P>
<P>The secondary endpoints consisted of fatal or non-fatal cerebrovascular events, fatal or non-fatal cardiac events, minor thrombotic complications (including atypical cerebral or visual symptoms of ischaemia, erythromelalgia, and thrombophlebitis), and major and minor thrombotic complications as previously defined.</P>
<P>Safety was assessed by examining rates of fatal and non-fatal major haemorrhage (any haemorrhage requiring transfusion, hospitalisation, or both), minor haemorrhage, and any adverse events leading to discontinuation of treatment.</P>
</CHAR_OUTCOMES>
<CHAR_NOTES MODIFIED="2013-03-09 10:29:18 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Cytoreductive therapy was used in the following percentages of participants:</P>
<P>- Phlebotomy: 175 participants (69.2%) in the aspirin group and 197 participants (74.3%) in the placebo group.</P>
<P>- Any cytoreductive drug (radioactive phosphorus, hydroxyurea, busulfan, chlorambucil, pipobroman, interferon alpha): 149 participants (58.9%) in the aspirin group and 145 participants (54.7%) in the placebo group.</P>
<P>After a planned interim safety analysis (in December 2000), the steering committee was informed that fewer centres than expected were recruiting effectively; that after the planned two years of recruitment, the rate of randomisation was reduced to nearly zero; that an impractically long follow-up period would be required to accumulate the number of events needed to reach the pre-defined rate of end points; and that no additional support for the trial could be obtained. For these reasons, the study was stopped, and follow-up of participants who had undergone randomisation was completed during the next 12 months. These decisions were made with the advice and consent of the data and safety monitoring board and were communicated to the investigators, who were monitored to ensure that they conducted a final follow-up visit. We obtained updated follow-up information after September 1, 2001, for 92% of the participants who had undergone randomisation, for a total duration of follow-up of 1478 person-years.</P>

<CHAR_PARTICIPANTS MODIFIED="2013-03-09 10:29:18 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Inclusion criteria:<BR/>Participants are included in the study if all of the following criteria are met:<BR/>
</P>
<P>A documented diagnosis of polycythaemia vera established within 5 years of registration. There must be documentation that the participant has met the revised WHO criteria for the diagnosis of polycythaemia vera. Participants must meet the 2 major criteria and 1 of the minor criteria. To verify that the criteria have been met, appropriate laboratory or pathology reports must be submitted demonstrating that the participant has documentation of these diagnostic criteria.<BR/>Major criteria:<BR/>Hemoglobin &gt;18.5 g/dL in men, &gt;16.5 g/dL in women, or other evidence of increased red cell volume.<BR/>Presence of <I>JAK 2V617F</I> or other functionally similar mutation such as <I>JAK2</I> exon 12 mutation.<BR/>Minor criteria:<BR/>Bone marrow biopsy showing hypercellularity for age with trilineage growth (panmyelosis) with prominent erythroid, granulocyte, and megakaryocytic proliferation.<BR/>Serum erythropoietin level below the reference range for normal.<BR/>Endogenous erythroid colony formation in vitro.<BR/>
</P>
<P>High cardiovascular risk due to a prior vascular event such as ischaemic stroke, MI, or venous thromboembolism. Objective documentation of these events must be accurately reviewed and registered. Stroke and pulmonary embolism must be documented by an imaging study, deep vein thrombosis by ultrasound or other objective methods, and MI by typical electrocardiogram (ECG) changes and/or an increase in serum troponin. Minor thrombotic events such as TIAs, superficial thrombophlebitis, or atypical microcirculatory disturbances alone or in combination are considered to be qualifying events.<BR/>
</P>
<P>No contraindication to aspirin use such as allergy, a history of a previous hemorrhagic stroke, or a major gastrointestinal bleed in the previous three months.<BR/>
</P>
<P>Use of hydroxyurea as a cytoreductive agent.<BR/>
</P>
<P>Signed informed consent: Participants must have signed consents for both the ISCLAP protocol and for the mandatory correlative biomarker MPD-RC 107 protocol to be eligible.<BR/>
</P>
<P>Serum bilirubin levels less than and/or equal to two times the upper limit of the normal range for the laboratory (ULN).<BR/>
</P>
<P>Serum glutamic-pyruvic transaminase (SGPT) alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels and serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST) less than and/or equal to 2 x ULN.<BR/>
</P>
<P>Serum creatinine levels less than and/or equal to 1.5 x ULN.<BR/>
</P>
<P>Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test before receiving clopidogrel treatment and should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant. Women of childbearing potential must practice effective methods of contraception (those generally accepted as standard-of-care measures). Women of childbearing potential are those who have not been menopausal for 12 months or who have not undergone previous surgical sterilization. If the participant is a woman of childbearing potential, she must use a medically acceptable form of contraception during the study period and for 30 days thereafter.<BR/>

</P>
<P>Participants requiring anticoagulation treatment with warfarin, heparin, or low-molecular-weight heparin for any medical condition.<BR/>
</P>
<P>Nursing and pregnant female participants. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect that she is pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her physician immediately.<BR/>
</P>

</P>
<P>&gt;81 years of age.<BR/>
</P>
<P>New York Heart Association (NYHA) Grade II or greater congestive heart failure.<BR/>
</P>
<P>A history of gastrointestinal bleeding in the last 12 months.<BR/>
</P>
<P>Major surgical procedure, open biopsy, or significant traumatic injury within 28 days, or anticipation of the need for a major surgical procedure during the course of the study.<BR/>
</P>
<P>Biopsy or other minor surgical procedure, excluding placement of a vascular access device or bone marrow biopsy, within 7 days before study enrolment.<BR/>
</P>
