<TITLE>Azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine for maintenance of remission in Crohn's disease</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2016-04-09 22:37:13 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>
<B>What is Crohn's disease?</B>
<BR/>Crohn's disease is a long-term chronic inflammatory bowel disease that can affect any part of the gastrointestinal tract from mouth to anus. Symptoms include abdominal pain, diarrhea and weight loss. When people with Crohn's disease are experiencing symptoms of the disease it is said to be &#8216;active&#8217;. Periods when the symptoms stop are called &#8216;remission&#8217;.</P>
<P>
<B>What are azathioprine</B> <B>and 6-mercaptopurine?</B>
<BR/>Azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine are oral medications that reduce the body's immune responses and may reduce inflammation associated with Crohn's disease.</P>
<P>
<B>What did the researchers investigate?</B>
<BR/>The researchers investigated whether azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine maintains remission in people with inactive Crohn's disease and whether these medications cause any harms (side effects). The researchers searched the medical literature up to June 30, 2015.</P>
<P>
<B>What did the researchers find?</B>
<BR/>The researchers identified 11 studies that included a total of 881 participants. Seven studies including 532 participants compared azathioprine to a placebo (a fake medicine such as a sugar pill). Two studies including 166 participants compared azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine to aminosalicylates (the anti-inflammatory medications mesalazine or sulfasalazine). One study including 77 participants compared azathioprine to budesonide (a steroid drug). One study including 31 participants compared 6-mercaptopurine to methotrexate (an immunosuppressive drug). One study including 36 participants compared combination therapy with azathioprine and infliximab (a biologic drug) to infliximab alone. One study with 147 participants compared the early use of azathioprine in patients with recently diagnosed Crohn's disease to a conventional management strategy. Two studies were rated as high quality. Three studies were rated as low quality. Six studies were rated as unclear quality due to a lack of information.</P>
<P>A pooled analysis of six studies (489 participants) suggests that azathioprine (at daily doses of 1.0 to 2.5 mg/kg/day) is superior to placebo for maintenance of remission of Crohn's disease over a 6 to 18 month period. A pooled analysis of two studies (166 participants) showed no difference in the proportion of patients who maintained remission between azathioprine (1.0 to 2.5 mg/kg/day) or 6-mercaptopurine (1.0 mg/day) and aminosalicylate therapy (mesalazine 3 g/day or sulfasalazine 0.5g/15 kg/day). One small study (77 participants) suggests that azathioprine (2.0 to 2.5 mg/kg/day) may be superior to budesonide (6 to 9 mg/day) for maintenance of remission over a one year period. One small study (36 participants) found no difference in maintenance of remission rates at one year between combination therapy with azathioprine (2.5 mg/kg/day) and infliximab (5 mg/kg every 8 weeks) compared to infliximab alone. One small study (31 participants) found no difference in maintenance of remission rates at one year between 6-mercaptopurine (1 mg/day) and methotrexate (10 mg/week). One study (147 participants) failed to show any difference in time spent in remission between early azathioprine treatment and a conventional management strategy. An increased risk of side effects was seen in participants who received azathioprine. Some of these side effects such as leukopenia (a reduction in the number of white cells in the blood) were serious in nature. Common side effects included pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas), leukopenia, nausea, allergic reaction and infection. The choice to use azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine should be made after careful consideration of the risks and benefits of using these drugs. More research is needed to allow conclusions about the comparative effectiveness and side effects of azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine compared to other maintenance therapies such as methotrexate. Further research is needed to assess the effectiveness and side effects of the use of azathioprine with infliximab and other biologics and to determine the optimal management strategy for patients with inactive Crohn's disease.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2016-04-09 22:42:12 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The therapeutic role of azathioprine (AZA) and 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) remains controversial due to their relatively slow onset of action and potential for adverse events. An updated meta-analysis was performed to evaluate the efficacy of these agents for the maintenance of remission in quiescent Crohn's disease.</P>

<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2015-10-29 10:01:01 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="John K MacDonald">
<P>Randomized controlled trials of oral azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine compared to placebo or active therapy involving adult patients (&gt; 18 years) with quiescent Crohn's disease were considered for inclusion. Patients with surgically-induced remission were excluded. </P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2015-10-30 08:52:39 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="John K MacDonald">
<P>At least two authors independently extracted data and assessed study quality using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. For dichotomous outcomes, we calculated the risk ratio (RR) and corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI). The primary outcome was maintenance of remission. Secondary outcomes included steroid sparing, adverse events, withdrawals due to adverse events and serious adverse events. All data were analyzed on an intention-to-treat basis. The overall quality of the evidence supporting the primary outcome and selected secondary outcomes was assessed using the GRADE criteria.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-05-05 10:39:09 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="John K MacDonald">
<P>Eleven studies (881 participants) were included. Comparisons included AZA versus placebo (7 studies, 532 participants), AZA or 6-MP versus mesalazine or sulfasalazine (2 studies, 166 participants), AZA versus budesonide (1 study, 77 participants), AZA and infliximab versus infliximab (1 study, 36 patients), 6-MP versus methotrexate (1 study, 31 patients), and early AZA versus conventional management (1 study, 147 participants). Two studies were rated as low risk of bias. Four studies were rated as high risk of bias for being non-blinded or single-blind. Five studies were rated as unclear risk of bias. A pooled analysis of six studies (489 participants) showed that AZA (1.0 to 2.5 mg/kg/day) was significantly superior to placebo for maintenance of remission over a 6 to 18 month period. Seventy-three per cent of patients in the AZA group maintained remission compared to 62% of placebo patients (RR 1.19, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.34). The number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome was nine. A GRADE analysis indicated that the overall quality of the evidence supporting this outcome was low due to sparse data (327 events) and unclear risk of bias. A pooled analysis of two studies (166 participants) showed no statistically significant difference in the proportion of patients who maintained remission between AZA (1.0 to 2.5 mg/kg/day) or 6-MP (1.0 mg/day) and mesalazine (3 g/day) or sulphasalazine (0.5 g/15 kg/day) therapy. Sixty-nine per cent of patients in the AZA/6-MP group maintained remission compared to 67% of mesalazine/sulphasalazine patients (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.34). A GRADE analysis indicated that the overall quality of the evidence supporting this outcome was low due to sparse data (113 events) and high or unclear risk of bias. One small study found AZA (2.0 to 2.5 mg/kg/day) to be superior to budesonide (6 to 9 mg/day) for maintenance of remission at one year. Seventy-six per cent (29/38) of AZA patients maintained remission compared to 46% (18/39) of budesonide patients (RR 1.65, 95% CI 1.13 to 2.42). GRADE indicated that the overall quality of the evidence supporting this outcome was low due to sparse data (47 events) and high risk of bias. One small study found no difference in maintenance of remission rates at one year between combination therapy with AZA (2.5 mg/kg) and infliximab (5 mg/kg every 8 weeks) compared to infliximab monotherapy. Eighty-one per cent (13/16) of patients in the combination therapy group maintained remission compared to 80% (16/20) of patients in the infliximab group (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.40). GRADE indicated that the overall quality of the evidence supporting this outcome was very low due to very sparse data (29 events) and high risk of bias. One small study found no difference in maintenance of remission rates at one year between 6-MP (1 mg/kg/day) and methotrexate (10 mg/week). Fifty per cent (8/16) of 6-MP patients maintained remission at one year compared to 53% (8/15) of methotrexate patients (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.47 to 1.85). GRADE indicated that the overall quality of the evidence supporting this outcome was very low due to very sparse data (16 events) and high risk of bias. One study (147 participants) failed to show any significant benefit for early azathioprine treatment over a conventional management strategy. In the early azathioprine treatment group 67% (11-85%) of trimesters were spent in remission compared to 56% (29-73%) in the conventional management group. AZA when compared to placebo had a significantly increased risk of adverse events (RR 1.29, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.64), withdrawal due to adverse events (3.12, 95% CI 1.59 to 6.09) and serious adverse events (RR 2.45, 95% CI 1.22 to 4.90). AZA/6-MP also demonstrated a significantly higher risk of serious adverse events when compared to mesalazine or sulphasalazine (RR 9.37, 95% CI 1.84 to 47.7). Common adverse events included pancreatitis, leukopenia, nausea, allergic reaction and infection.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2015-10-30 13:39:33 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="John K MacDonald">
<P>Low quality evidence suggests that AZA is more effective than placebo for maintenance of remission in Crohn's disease. Although AZA may be effective for maintenance of remission its use is limited by adverse effects. Low quality evidence suggests that AZA may be superior to budesonide for maintenance of remission but because of small study size and high risk of bias, this result should be interpreted with caution. No conclusions can be drawn from the other active comparator studies because of low and very low quality evidence. Adequately powered trials are needed to determine the comparative efficacy and safety of AZA and 6-MP compared to other active maintenance therapies. Further research is needed to assess the efficacy and safety of the use of AZA with infliximab and other biologics and to determine the optimal management strategy for patients with quiescent Crohn's disease.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2016-04-09 22:46:35 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The antimetabolite 6-mercaptopurine and its prodrug, azathioprine, are purine analogues that inhibit cell growth by directly interfering with nucleic acid synthesis. Because of their ability to impede the rapid cell proliferation involved in inflammatory processes, these drugs have been shown to demonstrate immuno-suppressive abilities (<LINK REF="REF-Sahasranaman-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sahasranaman 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>There have been many uncontrolled studies evaluating the efficacy of azathioprine for the therapy of Crohn's disease, and the first randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials were documented in the early 1970's (<LINK REF="REF-Rhodes-1970" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rhodes 1970</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Willoughby-1971" TYPE="STUDY">Willoughby 1971</LINK>). Although much experience has been gained with these drugs since then, the therapeutic role of azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine remains controversial, in part related to their slow acting therapeutic effect as well as their potential for adverse events, such as leukopenia, pancreatitis, nausea, hypersensitivity, and increased risk of malignancy (<LINK REF="REF-Gearry-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gearry 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>Crohn's disease is characterized by its propensity to relapse. Therefore studies were designed to determine the efficacy of azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine for maintenance of remission. This systematic review is an update of a previously published Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-Prefontaine-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Prefontaine 2009</LINK>).</P>

<P>Patients greater than 18 years of age with quiescent Crohn's disease (as defined by the included studies) were considered for inclusion.

<CRIT_OUTCOMES MODIFIED="2016-04-09 22:48:44 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Most of the included studies used the Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) to define remission (<LINK REF="REF-Best-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Best 1976</LINK>). Using the CDAI, remission is defined as a score of less than 150. The earlier studies utilized other scales such as the Disease Activity Score (DAS) (<LINK REF="REF-Dyer-1970" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dyer 1970</LINK>), and other less well defined measures such as maintenance of well being. Despite this diversity in outcome measurement, we felt that these earlier studies provided a reasonable measurement of clinically active and inactive disease.</P>

<P>Data from individual trials were combined for meta-analysis when the interventions, patient groups and outcomes were sufficiently similar (determined by consensus). We calculated the pooled RR and 95% CI for dichotomous outcomes using a fixed-effect model. If significant heterogeneity was identified a random-effects model was used. We performed subgroup analyses by dose of azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine (i.e. 1.0, 2.0, and 2.5 mg/kg/day). It was deemed acceptable to pool studies of azathioprine with 6-mercaptopurine studies, as azathioprine is metabolized to 6-mercaptopurine.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Candy-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Candy 1995</LINK> conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, trial to assess the efficacy of azathioprine in combination with prednisolone versus placebo in combination with prednisolone for induction and maintenance of remission in 63 patients with active Crohn's Disease (CDAI &gt; 200). Remission was defined as a CDAI score of &lt; 150. Patients (aged 15 to 65 years) were selected from a single site (Groot Schuur Hospital IBD Clinic). Patients were excluded from the study if they had previous surgery for Crohn's disease, symptoms suggestive of mechanical obstruction, recently received immunosuppressives, compromised hepatic function, or if they were pregnant or lactating. After one week of azathioprine 50 mg/day, the dose was held constant at 2.5 mg/kg/day for the remaining 11 weeks of phase 1, and for 12 months of phase 2 (or until the patient relapsed or withdrew from the study). In phase 1, patients (intervention group n = 33 and placebo group n = 30) received a tapering dose of prednisolone (initial dose 1 mg/kg/day tapered to 0 by week 12) in combination with azathioprine or placebo for induction of remission. Twenty out of 63 participants failed to achieve remission (7 in azathioprine group and 9 in placebo group) or withdrew from phase 1. During phase 2, patients (intervention group n = 24 and placebo group n = 19) continued to receive azathioprine or matched placebo for 12 months. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients in clinical remission. Secondary outcomes were median change in CDAI, ESR, serum CRP, serum orosomucoid concentration, and leucocyte count between the first and last visits. Differences in leucocyte count between baseline and final visit were evaluated for responders and non-responders within the intervention group. Adverse events and compliance were also monitored.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Cosnes-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Cosnes 2013</LINK> performed a three-year trial to evaluate the efficacy of early azathioprine treatment within six months of diagnosis versus conventional management of Crohn's disease patients with a high risk of disabling disease. Remission was defined as a trimester spent free of: flare, treatment with steroids or anti-TNF-alpha antagonists, active perianal disease (pain or discharge with induration, skin tags, ulceration, fissure or fistula), Crohn's disease-related hospitalization (including those caused by drug side effects); or surgery. The study was performed at 24 French centres and was a randomized, parallel group, open-label trial. Patients were at least 18 years of age (N = 147; intervention n= 72); and were classified as high risk if they had been diagnosed when they were under 40 years of age, had received corticosteroids within three months of diagnosis or had active perianal lesions. Patients were excluded if they had previous treatment with immunomodulators or anti&#8211;TNF-alpha therapy; immediate need for surgery or anti-TNF-alpha therapy; severe comorbidity; documented infection; renal or liver failure; contraindication to thiopurines according to labelling recommendations; malignancy; history of drug abuse; predictable poor compliance; or if they were pregnant. The primary outcome was the proportion of trimesters spent in remission. The secondary outcomes were the proportion of trimesters in the three year trial period that contain any of the above listed failures of remission; duration of significant corticosteroid exposure per trimester; total exposures (in milligrams) of prednisone and budesonide per trimester; time to first perianal surgery, first intestinal resection, and first anti-TNF use; median CDAI scores and C-reactive protein concentrations throughout follow-up; quality of life (measured by the IBD Questionnaire) at months 12, 24, and 36; total number of days of hospitalization; and total number of days out of work per trimester. Safety data and adverse events were also collected.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-L_x00e9_mann-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Lémann 2005</LINK> conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial at 11 French sites and 1 Belgian site. The study evaluated the effectiveness of azathioprine for long term remission of Crohn's disease. Patients were monitored for relapse, (defined as CDAI &gt; 250 or CDAI of 150-250 on 3 consecutive weeks plus an increase of &#8805; 75 points above baseline score, or the need for surgery (except limited perianal surgery)). Patients selected for the study (N = 83, azathioprine group, n = 40) were at least 18 years of age, and had continuous azathioprine treatment for a minimum of 42 months during which they did not experience a flare-up, receive oral prednisone (&gt;10 mg/day) budesonide or another immunosuppressive or biological agent; ingest artificial nutrition; undergo surgery (except limited perianal surgery). Patients were excluded if they had active disease (CDAI &gt; 150 at entry), disease was limited to the perianal area, or if they had received azathioprine to prevent postoperative recurrence after curative surgical resection. Adverse events were also monitored.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Mantzaris-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Mantzaris 2004</LINK> conducted a randomized, phase II study that evaluated the effectiveness of azathioprine combined with infliximab compared to infliximab monotherapy. Patients (N = 47) were between ages 18 and 57 with active, steroid-resistant Crohn's disease (CDAI &gt; 150). Patients were ineligible if they had fistulizing or fibrostenotic disease, septic complications, or if they had not received previous treatment with immunomodulators. After a six week induction phase, patients in remission continued their assigned therapies. All patients received either infliximab (5 mg/kg every 8 weeks) or infliximab and azathioprine (2.5 mg/kg/day). The primary outcome was the proportion of patients with maintenance of remission. Adverse effects were also monitored. The study was published as an abstract.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Mantzaris-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Mantzaris 2009</LINK> compared the effectiveness of azathioprine (2 to 2.5 mg/kg/day) to budesonide (6 to 9 mg/day) for maintenance of remission in patients (aged 18-67 years) with steroid-dependant Crohn's disease (CDAI &lt; 150) over a one year period, which was extended to 18 months for those maintaining remission at the one year cutoff. Steroid-dependency was described as individuals having at least one flare in the previous six to twelve months which had been successfully treated with steroids, but returned during steroid tapering or after steroid withdrawal. Included patients had recently flared (within one month of study inclusion) and were receiving a tapered dose of oral prednisolone for at least one month prior to randomization. The primary outcomes were mucosal healing and histological remission. Secondary outcomes included annual relapse rate, time in remission, discontinuation of study medications, changes in CDAI or health-related quality of life, and safety data. Compliance and the use of any other medications were also monitored.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Mat_x00e9__x002d_Jim_x00e9_nez-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Maté-Jiménez 2000</LINK> conducted a 106 week, single-centre, randomized three arm two phase trial with sub-stratification for ulcerative colitis (n = 34) and Crohn's disease (n = 38). The induction phase was 30 weeks, and was followed by a maintenance phase for 76 weeks to evaluate the efficacy of adding either 6-mercaptopurine, methotrexate or 5-aminosalicylic acid to prednisone to induce remission (phase one) and then maintain remission without prednisone (phase two). Patients selected for inclusion (N = 72) were aged 15 to 70 years with steroid-dependent, radiologically or endoscopically confirmed inflammatory bowel disease from Digestive DIseases Service, Hospital de la Princesa, who had been followed for at least one year and had never previously received either 6-mercaptopurine or methotrexate. Steroid dependence was defined as patients who could not be weaned off less than 20 mg prednisone without induction of inflammatory activity, and a CDAI &gt; 200. Exclusion criteria included: patients over the age of 70 years or under the age of 15 years; no signed consent; those with clinically significant cardiac, hepatic or renal disease; ongoing bacterial infection; pregnancy; lactating or not using reliable contraceptive techniques; patients using concomitant allopurinol, NSAIDs, tetracyclines or phenytoin in significant doses; those who have had extensive surgery for their Crohn's disease; or those who have symptoms that suggest a potential need for urgent surgery. The induction phase used the individualized dose of prednisone used prior to study inclusion as the starting dose (highest was 1 mg/kg/day prednisone) to be tapered by 8 mg/kg/day prednisone over the 30 weeks to 0 and the following therapies under study, 6-mercaptopurine 1.5mg/kg/day (group A, n = 16 with Crohn's), methotrexate, 15 mg/week (group B, n = 15 with Crohn's) or 5-aminosalicyclic acid, 3 g/day (group C, n = 7 with Crohn's). For the maintenance phase, only those who achieved remission after stopping prednisone during the induction phase were included in this portion of the study. In these patients the methotrexate dose was reduced to 10 mg/week and the 6-mercaptopurine dose reduced to 1 mg/kg/day. The 5-aminosalicylic acid dose used for maintenance therapy did not change (3g/day). No other medications, except antidiarrhoeals and supplements, were allowed. The primary outcome for phase one was induction of remission and cessation of steroids, while phase 2 was clinical remission. "Relapse was defined as CDAI &gt; 150 and orosomucoid &gt; 100 (N 88 mg/dl) with no response to 6 g daily of 5-aminosalicylic acid and with need of prednisone therapy in Crohn's disease patients." Adverse events were a secondary outcome.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Donoghue-1978" TYPE="STUDY">O'Donoghue 1978</LINK> performed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 52 week, withdrawal study, which initially sub-stratified participants into those only on azathioprine and those also on other anti-inflammatories and azathioprine. The study evaluated the efficacy of azathioprine for maintenance of remission, defined as preventing relapse ("significant deterioration in clinical state requiring a change in treatment as judged by two doctors unaware of the patient's treatment"), in patients (N = 51) with quiescent Crohn's disease taking azathioprine (2 mg/kg/day) for at least six months prior to study inclusion. Patients receiving azathioprine combined with sulphasalazine or low dose corticosteroids were included; this treatment remained unchanged throughout study period. Patients were also allowed medications for symptom control and supplements. Patients were monitored for primary outcomes using a modified DAS scoring system completed at each clinical assessment. Adverse events and serious adverse events were also monitored; one patient died during the study.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Panes-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Panes 2013</LINK> conducted a randomized, multi-centre, double-blind, placebo-controlled study over 76 weeks in 31 Spanish hospitals. The study evaluated the efficacy of early administration of azathioprine (2.5 mg/kg/day) in patients with newly diagnosed (&lt; 8 weeks) Crohn's disease for maintenance of corticosteroid-free clinical remission. Sustained corticosteroid-free remission was defined as the presence of clinical remission (CDAI score &lt; 150 at each visit) in patients who had not been treated with corticosteroids during the entire study or patients who were treated with corticosteroids at baseline after the scheduled weaning of this treatment. Patients (N= 131; azathioprine, n = 68) aged 18 to 70 years, diagnosed with established Crohn's disease criteria within 8 weeks of screening, "irrespective of disease activity and use of corticosteroids at the time of screening." Exclusion criteria included previous treatment with azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine, methotrexate, cyclosporin, tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, infliximab or adalimumab; patients with an immediate need for surgery or patients who had surgery for Crohn's disease; penetrating disease, symptomatic stenosis, perianal fistulas; patients with severe co-morbidities, documented infection, malignancy, history of drug use; or those who were pregnant. Corticosteroids were allowed to treat flares during the study, (prednisone doses ranged 1 mg/kg/day to a maximum of 60 mg/day; budesonide dosage 9 mg/day), but were tapered using a predetermined schedule. No other medications used to treat Crohn's disease were allowed, except antibiotics for suspected or demonstrated infection. Secondary outcomes included relapse-free survival, mean CDAI and IBDQ scores, and CRP concentrations at each visit; requirement for corticosteroids; cumulative dose of corticosteroids; development of a fistula; hospitalization; and CD-related surgery and cumulative prednisone dose. Safety data were also collected.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Rosenberg-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Rosenberg 1975</LINK> conducted a randomized, double-blind, identically matched placebo-controlled trial over 26 weeks that evaluated the effect of azathioprine (2.0 mg/kg/day) on reducing the need for steroids in patients &gt; 16 years of age with Crohn's disease who required daily prednisone (minimum dose 10 mg) for symptom control for at least 12 weeks prior to study inclusion (N = 20). Patients were excluded if they had advanced hepatic or renal disease, wished to become pregnant within the study time frame, or were likely to require surgery. The primary outcome was a reduction of prednisone usage over the trial. Prednisone was tapered according to a predetermined schedule when the patient met all of the following criteria: "3 or fewer bowel movements a day, absent to mild pain and malaise, weight loss less than 2 kg, and fever (&gt; 37.5ºC) less than one fourth of the time". Prednisone was increased by 10 mg/day if a patient had &gt; 6 bowel movements per day, severe pain or malaise, &gt; 3 kg weight loss or fever (&gt; 37.5ºC) for greater than half the time over seven days. If the patients condition did not change, the prednisone dosage remained constant. Patients were allowed to continue any other medications prescribed prior to study inclusion. Safety data were also collected.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Summers--1979" TYPE="STUDY">Summers 1979</LINK> conducted two independent trials at the same time to evaluate the efficacy of sulphasalazine, prednisone, and azathioprine against placebo for inducing and maintaining remission in patients with active Crohn's disease (CDAI &gt; 150 with radiologic findings of disease, Part 1, phase 1 and 2) and at maintaining remission in patients already in remission (either medically- or surgically-induced) (Part 2). The studies were randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials with patients from 14 centres. Part one was a two phase study, with the first phase (N = 295, placebo n = 77; sulphasalazine n = 74; prednisone n = 85; azathioprine n = 59) inducing remission over 17 weeks using the following identically matched medications and placebo: prednisone: 0.25 mg/kg/day if CDAI &lt; 150; 0.5 mg/kg/day if CDAI = 150 to 300; 0.75 mg/kg/day if CDAI &gt; 300; sulphasalazine: 1 g/15 kg/day; azathioprine: 2.5 mg/kg/day, or placebo. Patients who achieved remission in phase one entered phase two for one to two years of maintenance treatment. These 86 patients included 20 in the placebo group, 19 in the sulphasalazine group, 28 in the prednisone group and 19 in the azathioprine group. Part 2 evaluated maintenance of remission in 226 patients who achieved clinical remission in the previous 2 years or 48 who had undergone complete surgical resection of all diseased bowel within a year of entry. Part 2 included 274 patients: 101 received placebo, 58 received sulphasalazine, 61 received placebo and 54 received azathioprine. Both studies were also sub-stratified by disease sites, prior steroid usage and disease activity. Safety data were collected throughout both phases.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Willoughby-1971" TYPE="STUDY">Willoughby 1971</LINK> performed a 22 patient, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the effect that azathioprine has on maintaining remission of Crohn's disease once it has been induced by prednisolone alone or combined with azathioprine. This was completed using two groups of patients, randomizing each to azathioprine or placebo. Group 1 (n = 12, azathioprine n = 6) consisted of patients with first time attacks or relapses of moderate to severe severity not treated with steroids in the previous 3 months, while group 2 (n= 10, azathioprine n =5) studied outpatients maintained on long term prednisolone (7.5 to 15 mg/day) for 5 to 72 months. The first group received prednisolone (initial dose 60 mg/day) until remission was achieved; it was then tapered on a 3-week schedule to 10 mg and discontinued after hospital discharge if remission was maintained. Azathioprine was prescribed at 4.0 mg/kg/day for the first 10 days and then at 2.0 mg/kg/day until the end of 24 weeks. The second group received 2.0 mg/kg/day azathioprine or placebo and maintained their pre-study dose of prednisolone for "at least 4 weeks after prednisolone was reduced as for group 1." Participants were also prescribed prochlorperazine for nausea and codeine phosphate was continued if the patient received it prior to study entry. Disease activity was monitored using DAS and relapse was considered the return of previous symptoms.</P>

Two of the studies included an induction phase prior to the maintenance phase; as per protocol in the studies, only the patients entering remission in the induction phase were included in the maintenance phase (<LINK REF="STD-Candy-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Candy 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Summers--1979" TYPE="STUDY">Summers 1979</LINK> Part 1). The pooled analysis contains data from the maintenance phase of these two studies.

In total, 532 patients were included in the pooled analysis. There was a statistically significant difference in the proportion of patients who maintained remission over 6 to 18 months favouring azathioprine over placebo. Seventy-two per cent (175/244) of azathioprine patients were in remission at study endpoint compared to 58% (168/288) of placebo patients (RR 1.25, 95% CI 1.11 to 1.42). These studies were moderately heterogeneous (I² = 38%). We visually inspected the forest plot and one study appeared to be an outlier (<LINK REF="STD-Candy-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Candy 1995</LINK>). Further evaluation of the study characteristics showed that <LINK REF="STD-Candy-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Candy 1995</LINK> used a CDAI of less than 175 as criteria for remission, which was different from all the other studies using CDAI. A sensitivity analysis excluding <LINK REF="STD-Candy-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Candy 1995</LINK> appears to explain the heterogeneity. The pooled analysis included six studies and 489 participants and there was a statistically significant difference in the proportion of patients who maintained remission over 6 to 18 months favouring azathioprine over placebo. Seventy-three per cent (161/220) of azathioprine remained in remission at study endpoint compared to 62% (166/269) of placebo patients (RR 1.19, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.34; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%). The number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome was 9. A GRADE analysis indicated that the overall quality of the evidence supporting this outcome was low due to sparse data (327 events) and an unclear risk of bias in 5 of the studies in the pooled analysis. The pooled analysis for the 2.0 mg/kg/day subgroup showed a statistically significant difference favouring azathioprine over placebo (RR 1.33, 95% CI 1.10 to 1.61). There were no statistically significant differences between azathioprine and placebo for the 2.5 mg/kg/day (RR 1.17, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.45) or 1.0 mg/kg/day (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.34) subgroups.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2016-05-05 10:40:48 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="John K MacDonald">
<P>This systematic review included 11 randomized controlled trials (881 participants) that evaluated the efficacy and safety of azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine for maintaining remission achieved by medical therapy in patients with quiescent Crohn's disease. Seven studies compared azathioprine to placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Candy-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Candy 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-L_x00e9_mann-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Lémann 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Donoghue-1978" TYPE="STUDY">O'Donoghue 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Panes-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Panes 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rosenberg-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Rosenberg 1975</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Summers--1979" TYPE="STUDY">Summers 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Willoughby-1971" TYPE="STUDY">Willoughby 1971</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Summers--1979" TYPE="STUDY">Summers 1979</LINK> also compared azathioprine to sulfasalazine. <LINK REF="STD-Mat_x00e9__x002d_Jim_x00e9_nez-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Maté-Jiménez 2000</LINK> compared 6-mercaptopurine to mesalazine or methotrexate. One study compared azathioprine to budesonide (<LINK REF="STD-Mantzaris-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Mantzaris 2009</LINK>); one study compared the combination of azathioprine and infliximab to infliximab monotherapy (<LINK REF="STD-Mantzaris-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Mantzaris 2004</LINK>); and one study compared 6-mercaptopurine to methotrexate (<LINK REF="STD-Mat_x00e9__x002d_Jim_x00e9_nez-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Maté-Jiménez 2000</LINK>). One study compared the early administration of azathioprine to a conventional management strategy (<LINK REF="STD-Cosnes-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Cosnes 2013</LINK>).</P>
<P>A pooled analysis of six studies (489 participants) suggests that azathioprine (1.0 to 2.5 mg/kg/day) is superior to placebo for maintenance of remission in quiescent Crohn's disease over a 6 to 18 month period. The number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome was nine. A GRADE analysis indicated that the overall quality of the evidence supporting this outcome was low due to sparse data (327 events) and unclear risk of bias. Five of the studies in the pooled analysis were rated as unclear risk of bias for random sequence generation, allocation concealment or incomplete outcome data. Although azathioprine may be effective for maintenance of remission it is associated with a significantly increased risk of adverse events, withdrawal due to adverse events and serious adverse events relative to placebo. Common adverse events reported in the placebo-controlled trials include pancreatitis, leukopenia, nausea, allergic reaction and infection. The adverse effects of azathioprine are well recognized in clinical practice and limit its use. Azathioprine-related serious adverse events lead to cessation of therapy in 9 to 25% of patients (<LINK REF="REF-Gearry-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gearry 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gearry-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gearry 2005</LINK>). Adverse events associated with azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine include nausea, allergic reaction, flu-like illness, malaise, fevers, rash, abdominal pain, pancreatitis, hepatotoxicity, myelosuppression, and an increased risk of lymphoma (<LINK REF="REF-Dubinsky-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dubinsky 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kandiel-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kandiel 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Beaugerie-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beaugerie 2008</LINK>). Advances in the understanding of azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine drug metabolism have led to genetic and metabolite tests to help clinicians optimise the use of these drugs. Thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT) enzyme activity can predict potentially life threatening myelosuppression in patients who are TPMT-deficient (<LINK REF="REF-Dubinsky-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dubinsky 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gearry-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gearry 2005</LINK>). TPMT may also aid in determining optimal dosing (<LINK REF="REF-Dubinsky-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dubinsky 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gearry-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gearry 2005</LINK>). 6-Thioguanine nucleotides and 6-methylmercaptopurine concentrations are helpful in determining why a patient does not respond to a standard dose of azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine and may help avoid myelosuppression (<LINK REF="REF-Dubinsky-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dubinsky 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gearry-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gearry 2005</LINK>). The ratio of these metabolites can help differentiate between non-compliance, under-dosing, and drug resistance or refractory states (<LINK REF="REF-Dubinsky-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dubinsky 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gearry-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gearry 2005</LINK>). More research is required to determine the optimal use of these tests in patients with Crohn's disease. However, a randomized controlled trial looking at the role of metabolite monitoring proved not to be feasible and was terminated due to slow patient recruitment (<LINK REF="REF-NIDDK-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">NIDDK 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>The results of one small study (77 participants) suggest that azathioprine (2.0 to 2.5 mg/kg/day) may be superior to budesonide (6 to 9 mg/day) for maintenance of remission at one year (<LINK REF="STD-Mantzaris-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Mantzaris 2009</LINK>). However this result should be interpreted with caution as a GRADE analysis indicated that the overall quality of the evidence supporting this outcome was low due to sparse data (47 events) and high risk of bias (no blinding). There were no differences in withdrawals due to adverse events or serious adverse events. However, GRADE analyses indicated the quality of the evidence supporting these outcomes was very low due to very sparse data (two events for both comparisons) and high risk of bias. Further research is needed to allow any firm conclusions regarding the comparative efficacy and safety of azathioprine and budesonide for maintenance treatment in quiescent Crohn's disease.</P>
<P>A pooled analysis of two studies (166 participants) found no difference between azathioprine (1.0 to 2.5 mg/kg/day) or 6-mercaptopurine (1.0 mg/kg/day) and aminosalicylates (mezalazine 3 g/day or sulfasalazine 0.5 g/15 kg) in the proportion of patients who maintained remission at 12 months. A GRADE analysis indicated that the overall quality of the evidence supporting this outcome was low due to sparse data (113 events) and high or unclear risk of bias. <LINK REF="STD-Summers--1979" TYPE="STUDY">Summers 1979</LINK> was rated as unclear risk of bias for random sequence generation and incomplete outcome data and <LINK REF="STD-Mat_x00e9__x002d_Jim_x00e9_nez-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Maté-Jiménez 2000</LINK> was rated as high risk of bias for no blinding. A pooled analysis of two studies showed that antimetabolites (azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine) had a significantly increased risk of serious adverse events compared to aminosalicylates (mesalazine or sulphsalazine). However, a GRADE analysis indicated that the overall quality of the evidence supporting this outcome was very low due to sparse data (16 events) and high or unclear risk of bias. Further research with adequately powered trials is needed to allow any definitive conclusions regarding the comparative efficacy and safety of antimetabolites and aminosalicylates for maintenance therapy in Crohn's disease.</P>
<P>One small study (31 participants) found no difference between 6-mercaptopurine (1 mg/kg/day) and methotrexate (10 mg/week) in the proportion of patients who maintained remission at 72 weeks. A GRADE analysis indicated that the overall quality of the evidence supporting this outcome was very low due to very sparse data (16 events) and high risk of bias. No differences were found with respect to adverse events, withdrawals due to adverse events, or serious adverse events. GRADE analyses indicated that the overall quality of the evidence supporting these outcomes was very low due to very sparse data (19, 5 and 5 events respectively) and high risk of bias. Moderate quality evidence from a single high quality trial indicates that intramuscular methotrexate at a dose of 15 mg/week is superior to placebo for maintenance of remission in Crohn's disease. The number needed to treat with methotrexate for an additional beneficial outcome was four (<LINK REF="REF-Patel-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Patel 2014</LINK>). Only two small studies compare 6-mercaptopurine to methotrexate for maintenance of remission in Crohn's disease (<LINK REF="STD-Mat_x00e9__x002d_Jim_x00e9_nez-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Maté-Jiménez 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Oren-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Oren 1997</LINK>), and no studies compare azathioprine to methotrexate. Further research with adequately powered trials is necessary to allow any conclusions regarding the comparative efficacy and safety of antimetabolites (azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine) and methotrexate for maintenance therapy in Crohn's disease.</P>
<P>One small study (36 participants) found no difference in maintenance of remission rates at one year between combination therapy with azathioprine (2.5 mg/kg/day) and infliximab (5 mg/kg every 8 weeks) compared to infliximab monotherapy. A GRADE analysis indicated that the overall quality of the evidence supporting this outcome was very low due to very sparse data (29 events) and high risk of bias. An adequately powered trial would be necessary to allow for any conclusions regarding the role of azathioprine as an adjunctive to infliximab maintenance therapy in Crohn's disease. There is moderate quality evidence that combination therapy with azathioprine and infliximab is superior to infliximab monotherapy for induction of remission in moderate to severe Crohn's disease (<LINK REF="REF-Chande-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chande 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Colombel-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Colombel 2010</LINK>). Furthermore, therapy with azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine may help to prevent the development of antibodies to infliximab. The development of antibodies to infliximab has been associated with infusion reactions and loss of response to infliximab. An analysis of the ACCENT I induction trial data by <LINK REF="REF-Hanauer-2004b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hanauer 2004b</LINK> found that patients who received therapy with azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine or methotrexate in conjunction with infliximab had a significantly lower chance of developing antibodies to infliximab than patients who received infliximab monotherapy. Future maintenance trials assessing combination therapy should evaluate the interaction between antimetabolite (azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine) therapy and infliximab with respect to antibody formation and efficacy.</P>
<P>One study (147 participants) failed to show any significant benefit for early azathioprine treatment over a conventional management strategy. In the early azathioprine treatment group 67% (11-85%) of trimesters were spent in remission compared to 56% (29-73%) in the conventional management group. The results of this trial need to be confirmed by another study. Further research is required to determine optimal management strategies for patients with quiescent Crohn's disease.</P>
<P>The current review only included two studies where existing therapy was discontinued (<LINK REF="STD-L_x00e9_mann-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Lémann 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Donoghue-1978" TYPE="STUDY">O'Donoghue 1978</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Vilien-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Vilien 2004</LINK> which was excluded from this review, randomized patients to continue azathioprine therapy or to a no treatment control. The findings of this trial demonstrated that azathioprine was superior to no treatment for maintenance of remission (<LINK REF="STD-Vilien-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Vilien 2004</LINK>). Future studies could randomize patients started on a maintenance regimen to discontinue therapy after a given amount of time spent in remission (i.e. randomize to groups based on when they stop taking azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine). These patients could then be analysed on time in remission on azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine and risk of relapse thereafter. Such trials would enable physicians to better explain to their patients their likelihood of relapsing if they stop therapy. Moreover, such trials would enable physicians to better weigh the risks of adverse events with therapy to the risk of relapse without therapy.</P>
<P>We attempted to limit bias by performing a comprehensive literature search to identify all applicable studies. At least two review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion, extracted data and assessed study quality. However, the review does have some limitations. Only two of the included studies were rated as low risk of bias (<LINK REF="STD-L_x00e9_mann-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Lémann 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Panes-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Panes 2013</LINK>). Three studies were rated as high risk of bias because they were not blinded (<LINK REF="STD-Cosnes-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Cosnes 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mantzaris-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Mantzaris 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mat_x00e9__x002d_Jim_x00e9_nez-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Maté-Jiménez 2000</LINK>). The remaining six studies were rated as unclear risk of bias for random sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding, incomplete outcome data, selective reporting and other bias. Furthermore, GRADE analyses indicated that the overall quality of the evidence supporting the outcomes in this review ranged from low to very low quality.</P>

<P>Low quality evidence suggests that azathioprine is more effective than placebo for maintenance of remission in Crohn's disease. Although azathioprine may be effective for maintenance of remission its use may be limited by the potential for adverse events. Low quality evidence suggests that azathioprine may be superior to budesonide for maintenance of remission but because of small study size and high risk of bias, this result should be interpreted with caution. No conclusions can be drawn from the other active comparator studies because of low and very low quality evidence. The choice to use antimetabolite therapy should be individualized, and therapy should be undertaken only after a careful discussion of the risks and benefits with the patient.</P>
