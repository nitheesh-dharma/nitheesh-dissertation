<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>Blood clots in the veins of the leg are a common problem and are termed deep vein thrombosis (DVT). One in three patients with a DVT develops a complication known as post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS). This syndrome involves ongoing swelling of the affected leg, pain, and also skin changes. At the current time the main way of preventing PTS is to wear compression stockings. However, it is known that patients frequently find the stocking uncomfortable and would prefer to take an oral medication to prevent the problem.</P>
<P>Rutosides are a herbal remedy which have been shown to reduce swelling and skin changes in other conditions affecting the veins such as in chronic venous insufficiency. This review aimed to evaluate the existing literature to see if there was evidence from randomised controlled trials for the effectiveness of rutosides in preventing PTS following a DVT. We also aimed to investigate whether there were any side effects from the treatment.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics and key results</B>
</P>
<P>We searched existing databases (current until September 2015) for trials relating to the use of rutosides for the prevention of PTS following DVT. Two authors independently reviewed trials for inclusion and intended to extract results in line with prescribed criteria.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
</P>
<P>We did not find any trials of rutosides versus an alternative therapy for the prevention of PTS that were suitable for inclusion. We therefore have no evidence to support the use of rutosides in the prevention of PTS and high quality randomised controlled trials are required.</P>

<P>Post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS) is a long-term complication of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) that is characterised by pain, swelling, and skin changes in the affected limb. One in three patients with DVT will develop post-thrombotic sequelae within five years. The current standard care for the prevention of PTS following DVT is elastic compression stockings. Rutosides are a group of compounds derived from horse chestnut (Aesculus hippocastanum), a traditional herbal remedy for treating oedema formation in chronic venous insufficiency (CVI).

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2015-09-09 10:00:26 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Cathryn  Broderick">
<P>As there were no studies identified in this review there is currently insufficient evidence to determine the effectiveness and safety of rutosides for prevention of PTS in patients with DVT. Some studies suggest that rutosides may provide short-term relief of PTS symptoms. However, there is nothing published on their use as a preventative therapy for PTS. High quality randomised controlled trials of rutoside versus any alternative are required to build the evidence base in this area.</P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2015-09-15 13:20:50 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Cathryn  Broderick">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2015-08-26 14:12:58 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Cathryn  Broderick">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2013-02-27 19:54:16 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Heather  Maxwell">
<P>Post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS) is a long-term complication of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) that is characterised by pain, swelling, and skin changes in the affected limb. One in every three patients with a DVT will develop post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS) within five years (<LINK REF="REF-Prandoni-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Prandoni 1996</LINK>). Symtoms vary from mild to significantly debilitating. In the acute phase of DVT, a fresh thrombus in the deep vein produces an obstruction. In the first few months following DVT recanalisation (a complex process involving fibrinolysis, thrombus organisation, and neovascularisation) occurs (<LINK REF="REF-Meissner-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meissner 2002</LINK>). This process can result in valve destruction. Damaged valves, insufficient closure or occlusion, or both, of the veins increase pressure in the veins (venous hypertension). It is suggested that this venous hypertension disturbs the normal flow in small capillaries resulting in increased capillary filtration, which leads to oedema in the lower leg and a number of skin changes (<LINK REF="REF-Widmer-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Widmer 1985</LINK>). Whilst the anticoagulant treatment for DVT prevents clot extension and embolisation it does not break down the primary clot.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2013-02-27 19:56:26 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Heather  Maxwell">
<P>The standard therapy for both the prevention and treatment of PTS is elastic compression stocking (ECS) therapy of the legs. It is assumed to reduce oedema, accelerate venous blood flow, and improve venous pump function (<LINK REF="REF-Partsch-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Partsch 1991</LINK>). However, compression treatment sometimes leads to discomfort and has associated poor compliance, which renders oral drug treatment an attractive option.</P>
<P>Rutosides are a group of compounds derived from horse chestnut (Latin name: Aesculus hippocastanum), a traditional herbal remedy for treating oedema formation in chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) (<LINK REF="REF-Bombardelli-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bombardelli 1996</LINK>). The active component of horse chestnut seed extract (HCSE) is escin (also spelled aescin) (<LINK REF="REF-Guillaume-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guillaume 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lorenz-1960" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lorenz 1960</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schrader-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schrader 1995</LINK>). Rutosides and escin are known as 'venoactive' or 'phlebotonic' remedies.<BR/>
</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2013-02-27 20:06:50 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Heather  Maxwell">
<P>In CVI patients, white blood cells accumulate in the affected limbs (<LINK REF="REF-Moyses-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moyses 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Thomas-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thomas 1988</LINK>) resulting in activation of enzymes which degrade the protein within the capillary walls (<LINK REF="REF-Sarin-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sarin 1993</LINK>). Studies have shown that escin inhibits these enzymes, thereby preventing swelling due to loss of capillary wall patency (<LINK REF="REF-Facino-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Facino 1995</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2013-02-27 20:08:50 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Heather  Maxwell">
<P>There is evidence to support the use of rutosides for rapid relief of signs or symptoms in CVI and microangiopathy (<LINK REF="REF-Cesarone-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cesarone 2005</LINK>). A Cochrane review of 17 trials comparing HCSE against placebo, ECS, or other medications concluded that HCSE is effective for short-term treatment of CVI symptoms, such as leg pain and oedema, and that adverse events were mild and infrequent (<LINK REF="REF-Pittler-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pittler 2006</LINK>). However, it is not known whether rutosides are effective and safe in the prevention of PTS.</P>

<P>We intended for two review authors (JM and SEY) to independently assess bias using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. Disagreement was to be resolved by discussion. Five key domains were planned for bias examination: selection bias; performance bias; attrition bias; detection bias; and reporting bias. These were to be assessed and classified as either at a low risk of bias or a high risk. Where insufficient detail was reported in a study to assess the risk, this would be reported as 'unclear'.

<P>This was an open, randomised, pilot study to assess the use of hidrosmina (600 mg daily) compared with no treatment for prevention of PTS. One hundred consecutive patients with objectively confirmed DVT were randomly allocated using a randomisation schedule to receive either the intervention (n = 52) or no additional treatment (n = 48), at the point of hospital discharge. There were 49 male and 51 female participants (aged 17 to 76 years). In total, 89 patients had a unilateral lower limb DVT and 11 had bilateral events. Each patient was followed up at 4-month intervals for three years. At each follow-up appointment the participants were questioned regarding PTS symptoms in both the affected and unaffected leg (or both affected limbs for bilateral disease). Clinical examination was undertaken and PTS scored using the Society of Vascular Surgery/International Society for Cardiovascular Surgery scoring system (<LINK REF="REF-Iafrati-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Iafrati 1994</LINK>). The funding source was not declared. This study was excluded because hidrosmina is not a rutoside but an alternative venoactive remedy.</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2015-09-02 11:51:17 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Karen Welch">
<P>There are no included or excluded studies, therefore we were unable to assess the potential bias of the review process beyond the stage of trial selection.</P>
<P>The Cochrane Vascular Specialised Register is a comprehensive, weekly updated register of all publications relating to vascular diseases. As a result, when searched in combination with the CRS we believe that all trials with the potential for inclusion will have been identified. The search strategy was developed in conjunction with experts in the field to maximise study identification. It was not possible to contact any PTS specialists to recover any additional unpublished or ongoing studies. The search criteria only identified one potentially relevant study, which was ultimately excluded because the treatment was not a rutoside but an alternative venoactive remedy. After reference list scrutiny no additional potentially relevant trials were identified and we remain confident in our study identification process.</P>

<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2015-09-15 13:20:50 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Cathryn  Broderick">
<P>It was not possible to assess agreement or disagreement with other studies as no studies on the prevention of PTS using rutosides were identified. Similarly, limited evidence is available regarding the treatment of PTS using rutosides (<LINK REF="REF-Morling-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morling 2015</LINK>).</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2015-09-09 10:01:31 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Cathryn  Broderick">
<P>As there were no studies identified in this review there is currently insufficient evidence to determine the effectiveness and safety of rutosides for prevention of PTS in patients with DVT. Some studies suggest that rutosides may provide short-term relief of PTS symptoms. However, there is nothing published on their use as a preventative therapy for PTS. High quality randomised controlled trials of rutoside versus any alternative intervention are required to build the evidence base in this area. Elastic compression stockings remain the gold standard for the prevention of PTS in proximal DVT (<LINK REF="REF-Kolbach-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kolbach 2004</LINK>).</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2013-03-01 03:08:27 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Numerous in vitro studies conclude that rutosides reduce microvascular permeability both in healthy vessels and vessels showing signs of inflammation hence decreasing capillary flux or filtration, leakage, and swelling, with a potential improvement in signs and symptoms of PTS. Since PTS is not only dependent on platelets but also coagulation, fibrinolysis, and flow, studies have also shown that rutosides inhibit the aggregation of human red cells and platelets in vitro. Despite these in vitro research findings the effects have yet to be fully translated into human clinical trials. Rutosides may be a viable option for PTS prevention, and their use would benefit from a large blinded RCT using an agreed standard definition for PTS (the Villalta Scale) and against the current gold standard intervention (ECS).</P>

<P>The co-primary outcomes defined in the protocol (development of oedema and development of PTS) were amended to a single primary outcome: the development of PTS. This reflects that the development of PTS includes oedema and that to develop oedema without PTS would not fulfil the objective of the review. According to Cochrane guidelines the assessment of the quality of the trials for the updated versions are now described using the Cochrane risk of bias tool (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>).</P>
