<TITLE>Do a group of drugs known as monoaminergic agonists help the brain recovery after a severe injury?</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2010-05-06 14:30:20 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma M Sydenham">
<P>Not all of the brain damage sustained after a traumatic brain injury (TBI) is due to the direct injury that occurs at the moment of impact. Severe injury can initiate a sequence of events over several hours that can lead to secondary damage or death of brain tissue. However, the effectiveness of so-called "neuroprotective" interventions aimed at preventing this sequence of events or minimising its harm have so far been disappointing.</P>
<P>An alternative approach might be to use drugs known as monoaminergic agonists (MAs), which attempt to enhance brain repair after an injury. Animal studies have suggested that such drugs promote brain reorganisation and functional recovery after injury. The effectiveness of MAs in humans on recovery after brain injury has yet to be ascertained.</P>
<P>The authors of this review searched for all high quality trials investigating the effectiveness of MAs on the recovery of severely brain-injured patients of all ages. None of the published studies identified addressed the reseach question directly and thus they were not eligible for inclusion in the review. The authors therefore concluded that there are to date no satisfactory studies of the effectiveness of MAs for people who have experienced a severe TBI. Consequently, there is, at present, insufficient evidence to support the routine use of MAs to promote recovery from TBI.</P>
<P>The authors state that there is an urgent need to explore the effectiveness of interventions, such as MAs, for the enhancement of brain repair after a severe injury. The findings from existing trials of MAs require replication in larger studies, to involve other groups including more severely injured patients, and children.</P>

<P>Although there have been considerable gains in understanding the cascade of events that lead to secondary injury after traumatic brain injury (TBI), efforts to translate this understanding into new therapeutic, so-called neuroprotective approaches, have so far proved disappointing. As an alternative, there is growing interest in approaches to enhance brain repair after injury. Animal models suggest that agents enhancing monoaminergic transmission (monoaminergic agonists, or MAs) particularly amphetamines, promote motor recovery from focal brain injury and it is proposed that this might represent a complementary means of therapeutic intervention in the later post-injury phase.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2010-05-06 16:08:12 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma M Sydenham">
<P>Not all of the brain damage sustained after a traumatic brain injury (TBI) is due to direct injury occurring at the moment of impact. Severe injury sets in motion a cascade of events over several hours that can lead to secondary damage or death of brain tissue. Throughout the 1990s, much effort was directed at understanding these events, and developing neuroprotective drugs that might interrupt this cascade of secondary injury. In practice however, this has not led to major therapeutic breakthroughs. An important factor probably contributing to this disappointing conclusion is the need to intervene early within a "window of opportunity" before these processes are too far advanced.</P>
<P>Are there approaches other than, or additional to, trying to interrupt the immediate injury-related cascade of events? After the injury has been established, partial recovery of function occurs; can this be enhanced in any way?</P>
<P>The processes underlying the restoration of function after injury are poorly understood, but probably include: (i) full recovery of reversibly injured tissue, (ii) spared neural pathways taking over functions of destroyed networks, (iii) compensation through behavioural adaptation, and (iv) internal changes within neural networks caused by functional adaptations (changes in synaptic plasticity) brought about by external stimulation (<LINK REF="REF-Levin-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Levin 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>It has been suggested that drugs that promote monoaminergic neurotransmission may improve the functional recovery of the brain after an acquired injury has become established. There is specific experimental evidence for the efficacy of dexamphetamine in improving motor recoveries following focal brain injury in rats (<LINK REF="REF-Feeney-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Feeney 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gladstone-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gladstone 2000</LINK>). Indeed, in some animal models, not only has enhanced recovery of function been demonstrated, but also restoration of function that would otherwise have been permanently lost (<LINK REF="REF-Goldstein-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goldstein 2000</LINK>). Beneficial effects on outcome are reported in some clinical studies in the context of stroke (<LINK REF="REF-Crisostomo-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Crisostomo 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Walker_x002d_Batson-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walker-Batson 1995</LINK>) but not others (<LINK REF="REF-Sonde-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sonde 2001</LINK>). The use of amphetamines in stroke is the subject of a separate Cochrane systematic review (<LINK REF="REF-Martinsson-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Martinsson 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>The mechanisms of these effects are unclear. Hypotheses need to accommodate observations (in the rat) that recovery can occur within hours of administration; that short term administration leads to long acting benefits; and that behaviourally relevant training appears necessary in combination with the drug (<LINK REF="REF-Gladstone-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gladstone 2000</LINK>). There appears to be a synergistic effect of dexamphetamine with therapy (re-learning of movement) in animal studies (<LINK REF="REF-Feeney-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Feeney 1982</LINK>). In animal experiments, benefits are seen even if drug therapy is commenced some weeks after injury (<LINK REF="REF-Feeney-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Feeney 1998</LINK>). There are, however, some animal data showing deleterious effects of amphetamine therapy under certain conditions (<LINK REF="REF-Boyeson-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boyeson 1991</LINK>).</P>
<P>It has been suggested that these drugs are contributing to "metabolic normalisation" of dysfunctional, but still viable, neurons in the vicinity of the injury (<LINK REF="REF-Sutton-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sutton 2000</LINK>). However, immediate positive effects of amphetamines on experience-dependent learning have also been demonstrated in healthy human volunteers where presumably "normal" metabolic conditions pertain (<LINK REF="REF-Butefisch-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Butefisch 2002</LINK>). Increased expression of gene products and proteins associated with plasticity have been demonstrated (<LINK REF="REF-Stroemer-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stroemer 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wang-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wang 1994</LINK>). Amphetamines are believed to increase levels of noradrenaline (NA) in the brain by enhancing NA release. Another drug, methylphenidate, blocks NA re-uptake. L-threotops, a synthetic NA precursor, is also being evaluated in stroke (<LINK REF="REF-Miyai-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Miyai 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>A separate group of drugs within the class of MAs are dopaminergic agonists (<LINK REF="REF-Bales-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bales 2009</LINK>) of which the most widely studied has been amantadine, a drug also used in the treatment of Parkinson's disease.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Meythaler-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Meythaler 2002</LINK>
<BR/>The study by <LINK REF="STD-Meythaler-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Meythaler 2002</LINK> limited study entry only to a GCS of 10 or less (not &lt;= 8). This study assessed the effect of amantadine on neurorecovery following TBI in 35 participants. The methodology used was a double-blind, placebo controlled, cross-over design trial. Participants were enrolled when directly admitted to the emergency department with a TBI following a motor vehicle crash. Amantadine or placebo was delivered for six weeks in a cross-over trial with no washout period. All patients were recruited within six weeks from injury. Several outcome variables were measured, primarily the Disability Rating Scale (DRS), the Mini Mental State Exam (MMSE), the Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS), Galveston Orientation and Amnesia Test (GOAT), and the FIM cognitive Score (FIM-Cog). Comparison of scores at the end of the first six week period showed a significantly lower (better) DRS in the active treatment group. However DRS scores in the group receiving amantadine first were by chance lower (i.e. less disabled) than in the group receiving placebo first. The change in DRS score between the two groups at the end of six weeks was not statistically significant.</P>
<P>Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores were comparable in the two groups at treatment outset: there was a trend for a greater (better) absolute MMSE and gain in MMSE over the first six weeks in the group receiving active treatment for the first six weeks, however this did not reach statistical significance. There was no significant improvement in Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) or FIM Cognitive score (FIM-Cog) among the group receiving amantadine during the first six weeks. Due to the crossover nature of the study it is very difficult to assess whether use of amantadine affects final level of recovery over a longer period of follow-up.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Schneider-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Schneider 1999</LINK>
<BR/>This randomised controlled trial of amantadine has also been excluded on GCS severity threshold grounds. No GCS threshold was specified in the protocol. Seven out of 10 included patients had a GCS of &lt;= 8; one had a GCS &gt; 8 and GCS was unknown for two. It was not possible to identify and report separately on the GCS &lt;= 8 subgroup. The study used a crossover design with two week treatment periods (active or placebo) separated by a two week washout period. The outcomes measured were standardised neuropsychological testing and the Neurobehavioural Rating Scale. Of 18 enrolled patients only 10 completed the study, others withdrew consent for assessment or violated protocol.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Plenger-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Plenger 1996</LINK>
<BR/>In this trial the participants were less severely impaired at the time of study than the original intended study population of this review. This was because (i) entry criteria were not limited to severe injury (GCS &lt; 8) and (ii) use of methylphenidate was deferred until a certain degree of spontaneous recovery had occurred (as reflected in recovery of the Galveston orientation and amnesia test to &gt; 65). Although concealment and blinding were adequate (grade A, <LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>) and treatment and placebo groups were well matched, there were significant methodological weaknesses. These related primarily to marked patient drop out due to transfers to other rehabilitation facilities. Of 80 eligible patients only 23 were enrolled, the primary reason for non-participation being "rehabilitation readiness" of the remainder and their transfer to other facilities. Of the 23 enrolled, 12 patients reached 30-day follow-up (six active, six placebo) and only nine patients reached 90-day follow-up (five active, four placebo). Differential attrition resulted in a significantly higher initial GCS in the treatment group reaching 30-day follow-up relative to the placebo group, due to the presence of three "complicated mild" patients in the latter group, although these patients were retrospectively excluded in the published analyses. The study originally used a Wilcoxon rank sum test analysis reporting significant improvements in DRS at 30-days (P &lt; 0.007) but not at 90-days (P = 0.12). There were no deaths in this study and thus no data are available on the effects of methylphenidate on mortality.</P>
<P>The high and progressive loss to follow-up is a potential source of bias, since by implication loss to follow-up occurred among those patients recovering to "rehabilitation readiness", although the published data suggests that this loss occurred to a comparable extent in each group. There was an excess of "complicated mild" patients (not requiring intensive care but with positive findings on CT scan) in the treatment group at 30-day follow-up who were omitted from the published analysis because of the potential for biasing in favour of a treatment effect. These concerns have led to the study being excluded for the purposes of this review.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2010-05-06 12:01:14 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma M Sydenham">
<P>The Plenger study discussed above (<LINK REF="STD-Plenger-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Plenger 1996</LINK>) was reported as supporting the use of methylphenidate to promote rate of recovery after TBI. The non-parametric analysis used in the original paper appeared to show significantly lower disability in the treatment group at 30 days, although the effect was lost by 90 days. These conclusions are, however, severely affected by the selective loss to follow-up of less disabled survivors, as they were transferred to other centres.</P>
<P>Several excluded studies looked specifically at the use of methylphenidate in improving attention after head injury: a role more related to the widespread use of methylphenidate in attention deficit disorders. The role of methylphenidate in promoting motor recovery in more disabled survivors has not been addressed. A key priority of head injury rehabilitation research is the evaluation in clinical settings of approaches that animal data suggest may promote neural plasticity. One excluded study (<LINK REF="STD-Kaelin-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Kaelin 1996</LINK>) was a multiple-baseline (A-A-B-A) design study of the effect of methylphenidate on measures of attention. Disability rating scale (DRS) changes were also reported. Improvements in DRS were noted both spontaneously during the first seven-day interval (A-A) and the second seven-day interval, during which methylphenidate was administered (A-B). Friedman two-way ANOVA by ranks was used to compare average weekly change in DRS score and suggested that the mean improvement in DRS on treatment (27%) approached a significant difference (P &lt; 0.06) from the A-A change in baseline DRS score (15%). Speech et al (<LINK REF="STD-Speech-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Speech 1993</LINK>) used a placebo-controlled cross-over study to look at attentional endpoints and a measure of social adjustment (the Katz Rating Scale) following the use of methylphenidate late in the chronic recovery phase after head injury (minimum 14 months). No significant effects were reported on attention or social function. However, animal data on plasticity and reorganisation after brain injury would support the suggestion that this may be too late after injury to expect a beneficial effect.</P>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2010-05-06 12:01:12 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma M Sydenham">
<P>The US National Library of Medicine lists a trial (<LINK REF="STD-Blum-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Blum 2002</LINK>; NCT00035139) whose results have not yet been published although recruitment has now closed. Primary endpoints relate to the effects of eight weeks of methylphenidate on rate of recovery of cognitive, memory, and attentional skills in children with TBI. This study appears to be intervening late after injury.</P>
<P>Another paediatric pilot study (<LINK REF="STD-Philips-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Philips 2002</LINK>) of potential relevance to this review has closed. Data analysis is ongoing at the time of writing (June 2009).</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>At present there is insufficient evidence to support the routine use of methylphenidate or other related agents to promote recovery from TBI.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>In the absence of clear evidence of benefit from neuroprotective drug use, there is an urgent need to explore other potential modulators of late outcome from TBI. The reported results of these studies require replication in larger studies, extended to other groups including more severely injured patients, and children.</P>

<P>Retrospectively looked at 27 patients who had been admitted to the head injury rehab unit and had been prescribed dextroamphetamine. Dextroamphetamine enhanced the recovery and functional status in 15 of the 27. The 15 responders showed a significant improvement in GOS following treatment (P = 0.007). The only significant difference between these patients and those that did not respond to dextroamphetamine was duration between the TBI and treatment, with responders being treated more rapidly.</P>

<P>Multiple baseline, non-randomised (A-A-B-A) design study of the effect of methylphenidate on measures of attention after TBI. Disability Rating Scale (DRS) changes are also reported. Improvements in DRS are noted both spontaneously during the first seven-day interval (A-A) and the second seven-day interval, during which methylphenidate is administered (A-B). Friedman two-way ANOVA by ranks was used to compare average weekly change in DRS score and suggested that the mean improvement in DRS on treatment (27%) approached a significant difference (P &lt; 0.06) from the A-A change in baseline DRS score (15%).<BR/>

<P>Administration of 0.6mg/kg/day of methylphenidate (divided into two doses at 8 am and noon) versus placebo in a group of 23 adults (ages 16-64 years) who had made a partial recovery following a "complicated mild" to "moderately severe" TBI. Partial recovery was defined as a minimum Galveston Orientation and Amnesia Test (GOAT) score of 65 as a criterion of resolution of post-traumatic amnesia. Primary outcomes were the Disability Rating Scale (DRS) and measures of attention and motor performance at 30 and 90 days. Methylphenidate (or placebo) was discontinued for at least four days before assessment to allow resolution of temporary immediately drug-related effects. Main outcome endpoint is the Disability Rating Scale (DRS). The maximum score a patient can obtain on the DRS is 29 (extreme vegetative state). A person without disability would score zero. As discussed in the text of the review, the patients in this study were relatively unimpaired at the time of injury. This is reflected in the fact that the DRS score distributions in this study were extremely left-skewed (in the direction of less disability). Non-parametric analyses are used in the original paper to claim significant effect on DRS at 30, but not 90 days, in treatment group. Study excluded from review because of marked drop-out from both treatment and control groups.</P>
