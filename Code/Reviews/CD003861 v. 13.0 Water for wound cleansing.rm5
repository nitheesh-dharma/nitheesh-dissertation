<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2010-04-13 13:59:57 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Water is frequently used for cleaning wounds to prevent infection. This can be tap water, distilled water, cooled boiled water or saline (salty water). Using tap water to cleanse acute wounds in adults does not increase the infection rate; however, there is no strong evidence that cleansing per se is better than not cleansing. The reviewers concluded that where tap water is high quality (drinkable), it may be as good as other methods such as sterile water or saline (salty) water (and more cost-effective), but more research is needed.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2010-04-13 13:59:04 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Although various solutions have been recommended for cleansing wounds, normal saline is favoured as it is an isotonic solution and does not interfere with the normal healing process. Tap water is commonly used in the community for cleansing wounds because it is easily accessible, efficient and cost effective; however, there is an unresolved debate about its use.</P>

</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-01-24 16:33:36 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included 11 trials in this review. We identified seven trials that compared rates of infection and healing in wounds cleansed with water and normal saline; three trials compared cleansing with no cleansing and one trial compared procaine spirit with water. There were no standard criteria for assessing wound infection across the trials, which limited the ability to pool the data. The major comparisons were water with normal saline, and tap water with no cleansing. For chronic wounds, the risk of developing an infection when cleansed with tap water compared with normal saline was 0.16, (95% CI 0.01 to 2.96) demonstrating no difference between the two groups. The use of tap water to cleanse acute wounds in adults and children was not associated with a statistically significant difference in infection when compared to saline (adults: RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.42 to 1.04; children: RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.43 to 2.64). We identified no statistically significant differences in infection rates when wounds were cleansed with tap water or not cleansed at all (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.07 to 16.50). Likewise, there was no difference in the infection rate in episiotomy wounds cleansed with water or procaine spirit. The use of isotonic saline, distilled water and boiled water for cleansing open fractures also did not demonstrate a statistically significant difference in the number of fractures that were infected.</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2013-01-24 16:33:39 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is no evidence that using tap water to cleanse acute wounds in adults or children increases or reduces infection. There is not strong evidence that cleansing wounds per se increases healing or reduces infection. In the absence of potable tap water, boiled and cooled water as well as distilled water can be used as wound cleansing agents.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2010-04-13 14:00:07 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Management of chronic and acute wounds has changed significantly in the last decade; however, minimal attention has been focused on the types of solutions used for wound cleansing.</P>
<P>The process of wound cleansing involves the application of a non-toxic fluid to remove debris, wound exudate and metabolic wastes to create an optimal environment for wound healing (<LINK REF="REF-Murphy-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Murphy 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Waspe-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Waspe 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rodeheaver-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rodeheaver 1999</LINK>). Clinicians and manufacturers have recommended various cleansing agents for their supposed therapeutic value. Preparations with antiseptic properties have been traditionally used, but published research using animal models has suggested that antiseptic solutions may hinder the healing process (<LINK REF="REF-Brennan-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brennan 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Thomlinson-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thomlinson 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Glide-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glide 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bergstrom-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bergstrom 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hellewell-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hellewell 1997</LINK>). The controversy surrounding the use of antiseptics prompted the development of guidelines for the use of antiseptics by wound care experts. These guidelines have resulted in changes in hospital practice.</P>
<P>Normal saline (0.9%) is the favoured wound cleansing solution because it is an isotonic solution and does not interfere with the normal healing process, damage tissue, cause sensitisation or allergies or alter the normal bacterial flora of the skin (which would allow the growth of more virulent organisms) (<LINK REF="REF-Huxtable-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Huxtable 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lawrence-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lawrence 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Philips-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Philips 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Joanna-Briggs-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Joanna Briggs 1998</LINK>). Tap water is also recommended and has the advantages of being efficient, cost-effective and accessible (<LINK REF="REF-Fowler-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fowler 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Angeras-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Angeras 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Murphy-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Murphy 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Thompson-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thompson 1999</LINK>). However, clinicians have been cautioned against using tap water to cleanse wounds that have exposed bone or tendon, in which case normal saline is recommended (<LINK REF="REF-Lindholm-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lindholm 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>There has been much debate in clinical circles about the potential advantages and disadvantages of cleaning exudate from the wound, as the exudate itself may contain growth factors and chemokines which contribute to wound healing (<LINK REF="REF-Thomson-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thomson 1998</LINK>). However, the literature also suggests that large amounts of bacteria may inhibit wound healing because of the proteases secreted by the organisms (<LINK REF="REF-Robson-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Robson 1988</LINK>). Until further research has established its demerits, cleansing will continue to remain an integral part of the wound management process (<LINK REF="REF-Hellewell-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hellewell 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>Wounds cause considerable cost to individuals in terms of morbidity, and to the health services in terms of the personnel and consumables to perform wound care (<LINK REF="REF-Johnson-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnson 1997</LINK>). The purpose of this systematic review was to investigate the effectiveness of water for cleansing wounds in clinical practice.</P>

<P>We considered all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi RCTs comparing wound healing outcomes or infection rates in wounds cleaned with water and those cleaned with normal saline or any other solution eligible for inclusion in this review. A quasi RCT uses a method of allocating participants that is not truly random, e.g. according to date of birth (odd or even years) (<LINK REF="REF-Jadad-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jadad 1998</LINK>). We included trials if they reported an objective measure of infection such as wound culture or biopsy and objective measures of healing such as change in surface area and wound depth. We also included trials that included only subjective measures of infection such as redness, purulent discharge or swelling around the affected area in the review, but we analysed these separately. We included trials undertaken in any country, irrespective of the tap water quality, and there was no restriction on the basis of the language in which the trial reports were written.</P>

<P>The main comparison of water with other wound cleansing solutions was stratified by whether the wounds were classified as acute or chronic (we pre-specified this subgroup analysis in the protocol). We calculated a weighted treatment effect across trials using the Cochrane statistical package, RevMan version 4.2. We assessed trials for clinical heterogeneity by considering the settings, populations, interventions and outcomes. Where two or more trials compared similar solutions and used the same outcome measures, we tested them for heterogeneity using the I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2003</LINK>). This statistic examines the percentage of total variation across studies due to heterogeneity rather than to chance. Values of I<SUP>2</SUP> over 75% indicate a high level of heterogeneity and in such cases we would carefully consider the appropriateness of pooling. We have expressed dichotomous outcomes (e.g. number of patients developing a wound infection) as relative risks (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI).</P>

Two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Griffiths-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Griffiths 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moscati-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Moscati 2007</LINK>) clearly described concealed allocation, which was achieved by a computer generated randomisation process with the code held at a remote site.<BR/>
<BR/>Eight trials (<LINK REF="STD-Goldberg-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Goldberg 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Museru-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Museru 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Angeras-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Angeras 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Riederer-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Riederer 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Griffiths-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Griffiths 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bansal-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Bansal 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Valente-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Valente 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moscati-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Moscati 2007</LINK>) provided a clear description of the inclusion/exclusion criteria; three trials (<LINK REF="STD-Angeras-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Angeras 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Griffiths-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Griffiths 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moscati-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Moscati 2007</LINK>) provided information on whether the patients and the outcome assessors were blinded to the intervention.<BR/>
<BR/>A description of the baseline characteristics of the patients is essential to assess comparability between the groups (indicates if randomisation was successful). It also assists the reader in deciding if the results are applicable to their situation. The baseline characteristics for each treatment group were given in six of the nine trials (<LINK REF="STD-Angeras-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Angeras 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tay-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Tay 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Neues-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Neues 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Griffiths-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Griffiths 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bansal-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Bansal 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Valente-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Valente 2003</LINK>).

No wound infection was reported in any of the three groups. As the characteristics of the two groups that showered were comparable, we considered it appropriate to combine the data from those groups for comparison with data from the no cleansing group. Although this approach maintains the randomisation and avoids double counting, it results in unequally sized comparison groups.

A significantly higher infection rate in the saline group was reported in one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Angeras-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Angeras 1992</LINK>) which could be attributed to the difference in the temperature of the irrigant used (tap water was at 37ºC whilst normal saline was at room temperature). Two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Bansal-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Bansal 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Valente-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Valente 2003</LINK>) measured infection rates in children and the pooled results demonstrated no statistically significant difference in the infection rates in children whose wounds were cleansed with saline or tap water (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.43 to 2.64; P = 0.88) (<LINK REF="CMP-002.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.1</LINK>).</P>

In the trial by <LINK REF="STD-Griffiths-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Griffiths 2001</LINK>, the estimated cost per dressing using normal saline was AUD$1.43 plus the cost of the dressing, compared with AUD$1.16 using tap water. If the wound was cleansed during showering, the only cost would be the dressing. Costs for the saline group included staff time, materials and equipment used for the dressings. In the second trial (<LINK REF="STD-Moscati-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Moscati 2007</LINK>), costs were calculated to include supplies, saline and antibiotics if required. The costs were extrapolated to the eight million lacerations that occur in the USA each year. The results demonstrated an adjusted annual saving of US$65,600,000 if wounds were irrigated using tap water.</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2010-04-13 14:11:08 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This systematic review of the effectiveness of water for wound cleansing has summarised the best available evidence at the time of the report. Following an extensive literature search, we identified 11 trials that met the inclusion criteria and we have presented them in this review. With the exception of one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Angeras-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Angeras 1992</LINK>), there was no evidence of a benefit of cleansing, nor of any particular type of cleansing solution. However the trial by <LINK REF="STD-Angeras-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Angeras 1992</LINK> has some methodological flaws; for example the solutions were administered at different temperatures, therefore the evidence needs to be interpreted with caution and more rigorous research is needed. Furthermore the Angeras trial was conducted in Sweden, where high-quality drinking water is readily available. The use of tap water as a cleanser would not be recommended in a country where a constant supply of potable drinking water is not available.</P>
<P>The fundamental feature of RCTs is the ability to eliminate selection bias through the method of allocation. In three of the included trials, details of the method of randomisation of patients to treatment groups were absent (<LINK REF="STD-Museru-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Museru 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Neues-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Neues 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Godinez-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Godinez 2002</LINK>) and in six the methods were susceptible to selection bias (<LINK REF="STD-Goldberg-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Goldberg 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Angeras-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Angeras 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tay-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Tay 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Riederer-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Riederer 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Neues-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Neues 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Valente-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Valente 2003</LINK>), which reduces the strength of the evidence. The ability to extract definitive conclusions from the trials detailed in this review is reduced by the overall poor quality of the trials and the lack of replication of most comparisons. Although three trials (<LINK REF="STD-Goldberg-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Goldberg 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Museru-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Museru 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Angeras-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Angeras 1992</LINK>) were completed before the CONSORT guidelines were published (<LINK REF="REF-Begg-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Begg 1996</LINK>) when recommendations for trial reporting were formalised, the trial by <LINK REF="STD-Angeras-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Angeras 1992</LINK> was well reported.</P>
<P>It is essential that the eligibility criteria are well defined in order to understand the type of population treated. The eligibility criteria should also define the severity of the patients eligible to participate. For example the description of the type of wound should accord with a standard criteria. This would allow the findings and recommendations to be generalised to other clinical settings.</P>
<P>Data analysis regarding wound infection was complicated by a lack of consistency in the criteria used to assess wound infection. In addition, variance data for the healing outcomes were not reported in the study that compared tap water with procaine spirit (<LINK REF="STD-Tay-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Tay 1999</LINK>). The use of a standardised and validated tool for the measurement of wound infection and healing and an assessor blinded to the intervention would have enhanced the rigour of the trials and strengthened the evidence. Other outcomes such as patient comfort and satisfaction should be measured.</P>
<P>Meta-analysis was restricted to trials of the same intervention that assessed the same outcome and was consequently limited by the lack of replication studies. As a result, this report is mainly in the narrative form with figures utilised to highlight particular findings.</P>
<P>The lack of an apparent effect of cleansing on the infection and healing rates in wounds that were not cleansed and those that were cleansed with either tap water or other solutions is important for the clinicians and the health services. The current practice in wound management is to cleanse the wound while showering the patient and in many instances these patients include those who are bedfast (<LINK REF="REF-AWMA-Inc-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">AWMA Inc 2002</LINK>). In this review although all trials used some type of water, only three trials (<LINK REF="STD-Goldberg-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Goldberg 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Riederer-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Riederer 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Neues-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Neues 2000</LINK>) used showering as a method to cleanse wounds. While the findings of this review do not indicate adverse effects from the use of tap water, practitioners and health service managers should interpret the findings with caution as most of the comparisons were based on single trials, some of which do not report the methodology in sufficient detail to enable assessment of quality.</P>
<P>The availability and cost of resources may also determine which solution is used for cleansing wounds in different settings. One trial reported that in countries with limited resources, distilled or boiled water is used for wound cleansing without complications.</P>
<P>Prospective trials in this subject need to be more robust in order to assist clinicians and policy makers in making informed decisions about the appropriate use of solutions for cleansing wounds.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Limitations of the review</HEADING>
<P>Inadequate reporting of the trials made it difficult for the authors to critically appraise the validity of the trials. Although we attempted made to contact the authors to obtain additional data, we received no response and this lack of information is reflected in the report.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2013-01-24 16:33:50 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Tap water is a wound cleansing agent commonly used in the community and hospitals; however published data on patient outcomes from tap water cleansing have not previously been reviewed. Based on the randomised trials undertaken to date, evidence suggests that tap water is unlikely to be harmful if used for wound cleansing. The decision to use tap water to cleanse wounds should take into account the quality of water, nature of wounds and the patient's general condition, including the presence of comorbid conditions.</P>
<P>This update includes two trials undertaken in patients with acute lacerations which, together with the trial included in the previous review, demonstrate no reduction in the infection rates in wounds that were cleansed using tap water compared with those cleansed with normal saline. There is evidence that the use of tap water is cost-effective when it is undertaken as part of the patient's personal hygiene, as it limits the use of other equipment. The meta-analysis indicated no significant difference in the infection and healing rates in postoperative wounds that were cleansed with tap water (showered) and those that were not cleansed. Clinicians should consider the relative benefits of cleansing clean surgical wounds.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2010-04-13 14:11:18 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Properly designed multicentre trials are needed to compare the clinical benefits and cost effectiveness of different solutions for wound cleansing in different groups of patients, different types of wounds and in a wide range of settings.</P>
<P>Trials comparing cleansing with no cleansing are required to determine the extent to which cleansing contributes to the healing and infection of acute and chronic wounds.</P>
<P>The strongest evidence for whether tap water is an effective wound cleansing solution is likely to be provided by trials in which the volume and the temperature of the comparison solution are the same as the tap water.</P>
<P>Future research should have well defined inclusion and exclusion criteria, adequate sample size, methods to ensure baseline comparability of the groups, use of true randomisation with allocation concealment, use of an objective outcome measurement of wound infection and healing (e.g. percentage and absolute change in wound area), blinded outcome assessment, adequate follow-up period and appropriate statistical analysis.</P>
<P>The trials should be reported according to the guidelines set out in the CONSORT statement (<LINK REF="REF-Begg-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Begg 1996</LINK>) to enable readers to determine the validity and reliability of the results.</P>
<P>Given the purchasing costs of equipment, economic evaluations should be undertaken in future trials.</P>

<P>Thanks for bringing the correction to my attention. Please note the following changes which have been made to the text of the review:</P>
<OL>
<LI>Ten of the eleven studies is correct</LI>
<LI>Comparison 3: (A) Distilled water compared with cooled boiled water (Analysis 03, Outcome 01)</LI>
</OL>
<P>Primary outcome (Infection)<BR/>Six out of 35 patients (17%) in the distilled water group and 9/31(29%) in the cooled boiled water group developed a wound infection; this difference was not statistically significant. (RR 1.69, 95% CI 0.68 to 4.22). The small number of wounds cleansed using distilled water (n = 35) and cooled boiled water (n = 31) means that the study lacked power to detect clinically important differences (<LINK REF="STD-Museru-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Museru 1989</LINK>).</P>

<FEEDBACK_SUMMARY MODIFIED="2013-01-24 16:24:56 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>I recently had the opportunity to read your excellent Cochrane review on the topic of tap water for cleansing wounds (2012 update).<BR/>As an emergency physician I was particularly interested on the subsection of acute wounds but I seem to have found a possible error in your analysis. The error is likely to be due to accidental data entry while doing the meta-analysis and pertains to the numbers of patients included in the studies done on acute wounds in adults (analysis 2.1 in your review).<BR/>The study by Moscati et al had 300 patients in the tap water group and 334 in the saline group, you seem to have got it the other way round. This changes the relative risk to 1.21 (95% CI 0.54-2.71). This figure is in agreement with Moscati's own paper where he has calculated this (see page 406, 3rd para in his paper).<BR/>Another minor error is the number of patients in the saline group of Angeras' trial, he had 322, not 332 patients in that group. This of course does not change the relative risk of the individual study significantly.<BR/>When corrected, this changes the overall risk ratio for adults to 0.67 (95%CI 0.43-1.06), I used M-H fixed effects model for the calculation. It also increases the chi square to 3.48 and the I square to 43%. Put together, this would change the results significantly and the overall conclusion.<BR/>

<P>Thank you for bringing the data entry errors to my attention. I have corrected the errors in both the Moscati and Angeras trial and have adjusted the text and conclusions.
