<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Inhaled corticosteroids form the first choice for preventative treatment of asthma, but they remain expensive for health economies in developing countries. Oral prednisolone is very much cheaper. In this review, we found that, in the management of adults with chronic asthma, a daily dose of prednisolone 7.5 mg/day appears to be equivalent to a moderate to high dose of inhaled steroids (300-2000 mcg/day). Side effects may be present even with low doses of prednisolone, so if there is no alternative to oral steroids, the lowest effective dose should be prescribed. These findings may be use in developing countries where inhaled steroids are not widely available. </P>

<ABSTRACT MODIFIED="2008-08-20 09:46:27 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Steroids are a common treatment of chronic asthma as a maintenance therapy in both developed and developing countries across the world. The cost of inhaled steroids means that in developing countries their availability is limited, leading to poorly controlled asthma in patients who are prescribed low dosage inhaled steroids, or the additional use of oral steroids to control patients' asthma. </P>
<P>This review seeks to determine what dosage of oral steroids equates to the therapeutic effects of a moderate to high doses of inhaled steroids. </P>

<P>To determine therapeutically equivalent doses of inhaled versus oral steroids for adults with chronic asthma.</P>

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2008-08-20 09:46:27 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>The Cochrane Airways Group trials register was searched and experts in the field were contacted. Searches were current as of August 2008.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomised controlled trials were selected of at least 4 weeks duration and included patients over the age of 15 years with chronic asthma. Trials compared inhaled steroids and oral prednisolone or prednisone; where the maximum dose for inhaled steroids was 2000 mcg/day and prednisolone 60 mg (on alternate days).</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Two independent reviewers screened 1285 titles and abstracts from the electronic search, bibliography searches and other contacts. Of these, 10 trials met previously defined inclusion criteria. Two reviewers independently extracted study characteristics, and outcome measures.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>All trials were small and no data could be pooled. Carry-over effects were present in at least one cross-over trial. Data from six trials produced the same pattern, in which prednisolone 7.5-12 mg/day appeared to be as effective as inhaled steroid 300-2000 mcg/day. In two trials, inhaled steroid 300-400 mcg/day was more effective than prednisolone 5 mg/day. All doses of inhaled steroid appeared to be more effective than alternate day doses of prednisolone up to 60 mg on alternate days. Side-effect data were reported too variably to permit comparisons. A 30% incidence was reported in one study in patients receiving prednisolone 5 mg/day, none were reported in patients on inhaled steroids.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>A daily dose of prednisolone 7.5-10 mg/day appears to be equivalent to moderate-high dose inhaled corticosteroids. Side-effects may be present on low doses, so if there is no alternative to oral steroids, the lowest effective dose should be prescribed.</P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
</ABSTRACT>
<BODY MODIFIED="2008-08-20 10:27:59 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Asthma is one of the commonest chronic diseases in both developed and developing countries. Guidelines for the management of chronic asthma have been published in several countries and all emphasise inhaled corticosteroids in the control of symptoms and the underlying inflammation of airways (<LINK REF="REF-SAG-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">SAG 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-BTS-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">BTS 1993</LINK>). In developing countries however the use of inhaled steroids at the primary care level is often limited due to cost constraints. Although specialists may be allowed to prescribe higher doses of inhaled steroids, access to them for the large number of patients with asthma is not possible. The implication of this is that patients with chronic asthma remain poorly controlled on low doses of inhaled steroids or must be controlled by the addition of oral steroids (<LINK REF="REF-Mash-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mash 1997</LINK>). In some countries low dose oral steroids are advocated in preference to inhaled steroids with the rationale that systemic side effects are minimal.</P>
<P>This systematic review aims to assess the evidence for this position which is clearly in contradiction to most published guidelines. If low dose oral steroids can be justified then developing countries may be able to make considerable financial savings. If this is not the case, it provides a basis from which to encourage the availability of inhaled steroids without restrictions. This question this review will attempt to determine the dosage of oral steroids required to give a therapeutically equivalent effect to inhaled steroids. Other reviews will be necessary to fully answer the question regarding the relative safety of therapeutically equivalent dosages of inhaled and oral steroids.</P>

<STUDY_DESCRIPTION MODIFIED="2008-08-20 10:27:59 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The original search yielded 1285 trials of which 15 were identified as potentially meeting the inclusion criteria. Of these five were rejected after review of the full paper, leaving a total of 10 studies in the review. Nine of the studies compared daily oral steroids and one alternate-day oral steroids. Six compared oral steroids with beclomethasone dipropionate and four compared budesonide. In the <LINK REF="STD-Toogood-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Toogood 1987</LINK> study alternate day prednisone was compared with inhaled budesonide. All except two were cross-over designs. Four studies had included a washout period between administration of the steroid treatments. Six studies were on European populations, two from Canada, one from Australia and one from Thailand. All were conducted in hospital based settings. The largest number of participants was 75 and most of the studies had less than 30. The treatment period was short in all studies (2-4 weeks) although <LINK REF="STD-BTTA-1975" TYPE="STUDY">BTTA 1975</LINK> treated for 24 weeks. Seven of the studies were in moderate to severe asthmatics; in five of these studies the participants had previously taken oral steroids and in two only inhaled steroids. Two of the studies were in mild to moderate asthmatics and in one of these, participants had previously taken inhaled steroids. In one study severity of asthma was unclear, but participants had previously taken alternate-day oral and daily inhaled steroids. In seven of the studies the inhaled steroid was delivered by aerosol and in 3 by aerosol with a spacer device. Nine studies recorded outcomes using a diary card and nine from clinic visits. The most commonly used measurement was the morning and evening PEF.</P>
<P>A further search was conducted in August 2008. No additional studies were identified that merited scrutiny as full-text papers.</P>

<STUDY_QUALITY>
<P>Allocation concealment was unclear in all the studies. The risk of bias was also rated as A, B C separately from the allocation concealment. Six of the studies were rated as having a low risk of bias (A), two of the studies as a moderate risk (B) and two of the studies as a high risk of bias (C ). In the two studies rated as B one was only single blind and the other had two patients unaccounted for at the end of the trial. In the two studies rated as C; <LINK REF="STD-Toogood-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Toogood 1987</LINK>did not clarify the number of participants and the severity of asthma, <LINK REF="STD-Rosenhall-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Rosenhall 1982</LINK> did not clarify the process of blinding. Both studies did not present their basic data. Although <LINK REF="STD-Lahdensuo-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Lahdensuo 1974</LINK> was rated an A according to our criteria, the study design failed to prevent considerable carry-over effects between the two treatments and this limits the usefulness of the conclusions from this study.</P>
</STUDY_QUALITY>
<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
<P>Details of doses and all measured outcomes are contained in <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>. Only the studies by <LINK REF="STD-Namsirikul-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Namsirikul 1989</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Bosman-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Bosman 1994</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Jenkins-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Jenkins 1988</LINK> presented data in a form that could be pooled, however it was not possible to combine data from any two of these trials. <LINK REF="STD-Namsirikul-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Namsirikul 1989</LINK> concluded that inhaled budesonide 400 mcg was more potent than prednisolone 5 mg, but that budesonide 800 mcg was therapeutically equivalent to prednisolone 10 mg. <LINK REF="STD-Bosman-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Bosman 1994</LINK> concluded that 2000 mcg of inhaled beclomethasone was therapeutically equivalent to 10 mg of oral prednisone, apart from superiority of beclomethasone for the morning PEF. <LINK REF="STD-Jenkins-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Jenkins 1988</LINK> concluded that inhaled beclomethasone 1200 mcg was therapeutically equivalent to 12.5 mg of oral prednisone.</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Eriksson-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Eriksson 1975</LINK>, data on 19 patients was presented (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>). The mean morning PEF from the diary cards for the group receiving beclomethasone 300 mcg/day was 266 L/min and for prednisolone 5 mg/day 243 L/min; for the evening PEF the values were 326 L/min and 306 L/min respectively. The differences between beclomethasone and prednisolone were statistically significant (p&lt;0.05). No washout period was given between the two treatments. For the clinic based readings, the FEV1, VC and PEF were reported both pre and post bronchodilator for each treatment group. The pre-bronchodilator FEV1 (mean+/-SEM) was 1.97+/-0.18 litre in the beclomethasone group and 1.79+/-0.18 litre with prednisolone. The corresponding post-bronchodilator FEV1 values were 2.30+/-0.22 litre and 2.07+/-0.27 litre respectively. The pre-bronchodilator group PEF (mean +/- SEM) was 326+/-26 L/min in the beclomethasone group and 268+/-27 L/min in the prednisolone group. This difference was statistically significant (p&lt;0.05). The post-bronchodilator PEF values were 382 +/-36 L/min and 338+/-41 L/min respectively. The authors concluded that 300 mcg/day of inhaled beclomethasone gave a better therapeutic effect than 5 mg/day of oral prednisolone.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Lahdensuo-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Lahdensuo 1974</LINK> reported data in two groups (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>). Group A received beclomethasone 800 mcg,/day then prednisolone 10 mg/day; Group B were given the drugs in the reverse order. In Group A the baseline morning PEF (+/- SEM) was 220 +/- 30.9 L/min and this rose to 272 +/- 22.1 L/min with beclomethasone and 315+/- 26.1 L/min with prednisolone. For the evening PEF the corresponding values were baseline 336+/-44.8, L/min beclomethasone 373+/-30.3 L/min, prednisolone 421+/-25.3 L/min. The effect on the morning values was not significantly different between the drugs, but the effect on the evening values was significantly better with prednisolone. In group B the baseline morning PEF was 250+/-19.0 L/min and this rose to 353+/-28.2 L/min with beclomethasone and 302+/-24.4 L/min with prednisolone. For the evening PEF the corresponding values were baseline 362+/-26.7 L/min, beclomethasone 440+/-30.9 L/min and prednisolone 395+/-37.6 L/min. The study concluded that 800 mcg of inhaled beclomethasone was therapeutically equivalent to 10 mg of oral prednisolone. There was no washout period in this study and the data are highly suggestive of a carry-over effect.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Lal-1972" TYPE="STUDY">Lal 1972</LINK> compared beclomethasone 300 mcg and prednisolone 7 mg (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>). The FEV1 after prednisolone was 2.34 litres (range 0.9-4.7 litres) and after beclomethasone 2.38 litres (range 1.0-4.8 litres). The mean PEF in the morning was 281 L/min (range 124-501 litre) for prednisolone and 288 L/min (range 125-532 L/min) for beclomethasone; in the evening the corresponding values were 293 (range 139-501 L/min ) and 310 L/min (range 150-538 L/min). This study concluded that 300 mcg/day of inhaled beclomethasone is therapeutically equivalent to 7 mg of oral prednisone.</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-BTTA-1975" TYPE="STUDY">BTTA 1975</LINK>, data for 67 patients were analysed; the remaining 8 patients were withdrawn because of side-effects and poor control of asthma. Diary card data (frequency of use of inhaled and oral steroids, asthma severity and additional use of corticosteroids) and clinic visits (monthly PEF) were analysed. A 'failure day' was defined as a day on which &gt; 4 puffs of bronchodilator was used; or a day on which oral and inhaled steroid therapies were increased to obtain a new stable dose. On average there was &lt;1 'failure day' per month per patient in each of the three test groups:prednisolone, beclomethasone and inhaled betamethasone. There was no significant difference between treatment groups whose maintenance dose was increased (between 14% and 26% of patients) and for those prescribed short course prednisone (between 4% and 10% of patients). The mean monthly PEF was similar in each group: 302 L/min in patients who received prednisone, 300 L/min in those who used beclomethasone dipropionate and 270 L/min in those who were treated with betamethasone valerate. On average, 400 mcg/day of inhaled corticosteroid provided control of asthma similar to that provided by 7.5 mg/day of prednisone. The different study design precluded presentation of the data in <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>.</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Rosenhall-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Rosenhall 1982</LINK>, data for 16 patients were analysed. Basic results were not provided. When compared to baseline, the morning PEF had significantly improved with the two high dose treatments (budesonide 800 mcg/day and prednisolone 20 mg/day) but not with the low dose (budesonide 400 mcg/day and prednisolone 10 mg/day) treatments. Overall budesonide 400 mg/day was found to be equipotent to prednisolone 10 mg/day ( as well as baseline) and budesonide 800 mg/day gave the same additional effect as prednisolone 20 mg/day.</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Toogood-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Toogood 1989</LINK>, data from two groups of 17 patients were analysed. The doses of prednisolone used in this study ranged 10-40 mg/day. The DEP group was defined as the patients previously dependent on regular dose of prednisone and the NON DEP group as patients not previously dependent on prednisone. Both DEP and NON DEP groups demonstrated dose-dependent improvement in the mean frequency and severity of asthma symptoms, FEV1 and morning and evening PEF. Basic data were not provided and results were given in graphical form. The study conclusions were based on the potency ratio of the number of milligrams of prednisone that were equivalent to budesonide 1000 mcg/day. In the DEP group the following potency ratios for different outcomes were given: morning and evening PEF 136 mg/day, FEV1 85 mg/day, symptom frequency 35 mg/day, mean severity of asthma symptoms 27 mg/day. For the NON DEP: morning and evening PEF 53 mg/day, FEV1 91 mg/day, symptom frequency 58 mg/day, mean severity of asthma symptoms 42 mg/day When combining both DEP and NON DEP for all outcome measure an equivalent potency of 57.5 mg/day of prednisone was obtained for 11000 mcg/day of budesonide.<BR/> <BR/>In <LINK REF="STD-Toogood-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Toogood 1987</LINK>, data from 14 patients were analysed. Basic data was not provided and results were given in graphical form. From baseline the inhaled budesonide 800 mcg produced a significant and sustained increase in FEV1, but there was no accompanying reduction in asthma frequency or severity. When patients were prescribed alternate day prednisolone, FEV1, asthma frequency and severity deteriorated despite increasing doses. The differences between the budesonide and prednisone were statistically significant at most of the individual dose levels (p&lt;0.05). Patients on inhaled budesonide showed statistically less asthmatic disability than with oral alternate-day prednisone (p=0.05). Budesonide 800 mcg or 1600 mcg/day proved more effective than any of the three doses used in terms of the effects on FEV1 (p=0.06), frequency of asthma attacks (p=0.02) and mean severity of asthma (p=0.008).</P>
<P>Side effect data were reported variably. In <LINK REF="STD-BTTA-1975" TYPE="STUDY">BTTA 1975</LINK> , 30% of patients reported side-effects such as oedema, dyspepsia, cushingoid appearance and weight gain from 5 mg of prednisone and none from the inhaled therapy. In <LINK REF="STD-Toogood-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Toogood 1989</LINK>, the systemic potency of 1 mg/day of budesonide was found equivalent to 9.2 mg/day of prednisone by measuring serum cortisol and peripheral blood eosinophils. </P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2008-08-20 09:43:56 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>The design of trials to assess equivalence of treatments have a number of important methodological issues. One requirement of equivalence studies is the need for limits of equivalence to be set, a priori. Absolute equivalence, i.e. zero difference between treatments will not occur, so it is necessary to set limits above and below zero difference within which equivalence can be assumed. These limits are usually set at ± 50% of the therapeutic effect of the treatment. Such limits have not yet been established for steroid therapy for asthma. In the absence of empirically derived limits, values of ± 0.15 litres for FEV1 or ± 15 L/min for PEFR might be reasonable conservative estimates (<LINK REF="REF-Ebbutt-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ebbutt 1998</LINK>). A further consideration is the effect of floor and ceiling effects. In the former, inadequate doses of drug may be given, leading to a false assumption of equivalence, neither dose being effective. Ceiling effects occur when a drug is close to the top of its dose response curve. Very large increases in dose will produce small increases in effect that will be insufficient to move the difference between the efficacy of the two treatments outside the limits of equivalence. False equivalence is shown by equally ineffective treatment as demonstrated by the lower dosage schedule in <LINK REF="STD-Rosenhall-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Rosenhall 1982</LINK> which also scored a high risk of bias. A ceiling effect may be relevant in <LINK REF="STD-Bosman-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Bosman 1994</LINK> where a dose of 2000 mcg/day is used in a study population who were already well controlled. Unfortunately, very little is known about dose-response effects for steroids in chronic asthma. (A Cochrane review in progress has found little evidence for a dose response effect for inhaled beclomethasone or budesonide. Nothing is known about dose response effects for oral steroids in chronic asthma). Thus 800 mcg/day inhaled steroid may lie towards the top of a dose response curve for inhaled steroid and produce an effect indistinguishable from that produced by prednisolone in a dose of 40 mg/day.</P>
<P>The design requirement for equivalence studies limitation is compounded by the need for larger sample sizes in such trials compared to those designed to test for a difference between treatments (<LINK REF="REF-Jones-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jones 1996</LINK>). In addition to the methodological quality a number of other factors must be considered in trying to explain the diversity of findings. The included studies all had small sample sizes and could not be combined in a meta-analysis due to differences in pharmacokinetic properties of drugs, dosages, delivery systems and outcome measurements. In addition the review was limited by the poor reporting of basic data, failure to adequately report on allocation concealment and inability to access the basic data from the original authors (<LINK REF="REF-Walters-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walters 1999</LINK>). The patient populations included in the studies are described as mild, moderate or severe but the basis of this classification is unclear and open to interpretation. The dosing schedule of 4 times a day has been shown to be up to 8 times as potent as the same dose given twice a day and the studies varied considerably in this respect (<LINK REF="REF-Toogood-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Toogood 1982</LINK>). The delivery system also varied between studies with <LINK REF="STD-Toogood-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Toogood 1989</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Toogood-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Toogood 1987</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Namsirikul-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Namsirikul 1989</LINK> being the only researchers to use a spacer device.</P>
<P>Spacer devices have been shown to double the anti-asthmatic potency of budesonide (<LINK REF="REF-Toogood-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Toogood 1984</LINK>) however the use of a spacer is not able to fully explain the relatively high potency of inhaled budesonide in <LINK REF="STD-Toogood-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Toogood 1989</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Toogood-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Toogood 1987</LINK>. Interpretation of <LINK REF="STD-Toogood-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Toogood 1989</LINK> is limited by the method of reporting the results (as the dose of prednisolone equivalent to 1000 mcg/day budesonide). A number of factors may have influenced these results. As pointed out already, the assumption of perfect equivalence is not correct. There are measurement and sampling errors in all trials. In the presence of very small patient numbers, as in this study, the confidence intervals around the difference between the two drugs will be wide. Thus there is a high probability of one drug appearing to be more effective than another. Dose-response effects may also have played a role. The prednisolone doses in this study ranged 10-40 mg/day. It is quite possible that the dose-response curve for prednisolone is rather flat above 20 mg/day, so budesonide 1000 mcg/day could appear equivalent to prednisolone in doses of 20 mg/day and 40 mg/day. Thirdly, the results were expressed as a ratio. This permits an apparent inflation of effects if the denominator is small. As can be seen from the results from other studies in this review, the degree of scatter around the response to steroids may be large. Thus a chance 'over-estimate' of the numerator coupled with a chance 'under-estimate' of the denominator will give an apparently large ratio of effect in favour of the numerator. These factors and the absence of basic measured data mean the results of this trial are effectively uninterpretable.</P>
<P>The studies all differed in their use of concomitant therapy; in particular <LINK REF="STD-Jenkins-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Jenkins 1988</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Lahdensuo-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Lahdensuo 1974</LINK> added the intervention to prior therapy with inhaled and oral steroids. Variation in the determination of equivalence may also depend on the inclusion of a washout period in the study design and type of outcome measure chosen. When designing the study, absence of a proper washout period minimises treatment effects because of carryover effect or slow response,This would favour a result that would point to equivalence. The evaluation of equivalence will also vary depending on the outcome measure used. In the Toogood study this was well demonstrated with a five-fold difference between equivalence in different outcome measures. In all these studies which compare inhaled with oral therapy in the same subjects there may be wide variation in the actual inhaled drug delivered relative to the stated dose given. The actual deposition may vary with the type of delivery device and particle characteristics, its use by the patient as well as the physical characteristics of the patient (<LINK REF="REF-Carveth-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carveth 1999</LINK>). It is difficult therefore to define exactly the actual inhaled dose being compared to the oral regime.</P>
<P>Is it possible to draw any conclusions from these trials? A firm conclusion cannot be drawn, but a pattern emerges from these data. Three studies with a washout phase (<LINK REF="STD-Namsirikul-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Namsirikul 1989</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Bosman-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Bosman 1994</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Jenkins-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Jenkins 1988</LINK>) suggest that prednisolone 10-12.5 mg/day is equivalent to beclomethasone 800-2000 mcg/day. In the studies without a washout (<LINK REF="STD-Lal-1972" TYPE="STUDY">Lal 1972</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-BTTA-1975" TYPE="STUDY">BTTA 1975</LINK>), prednisolone 7-110 mg/day was equivalent to 300-400 mcg/day of beclomethasone or budesonide. In the first part of the Group A of <LINK REF="STD-Lahdensuo-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Lahdensuo 1974</LINK>, the change in PEF from baseline to beclomethasone 800 mcg/day was 52 L/min. In the first part of the Group B of <LINK REF="STD-Lahdensuo-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Lahdensuo 1974</LINK>, the change in PEF from baseline to prednisolone 10 mg/day was 48 L/min. Thus similar efficacy for the two treatments was obtained from the two limbs of this trial. Overall, there appears to be equivalence between 7.5-12.5 mg/day prednisolone and 300-2000 mcg/day inhaled steroid. This conclusion should be set against the results from two studies, one with a washout (<LINK REF="STD-Namsirikul-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Namsirikul 1989</LINK>) and one without (<LINK REF="STD-Eriksson-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Eriksson 1975</LINK>) in which doses of inhaled steroid in the range 300-400 mcg/day were more effective that prednisolone 5 mg/day. Finally, it should be noted that inhaled therapy appeared to be more effective than alternate day oral prednisolone in doses up to 60 mg on alternate days.</P>
<P>The strongest conclusions to be drawn from the study are that prednisolone in a dose of approximately 10 mg day is equivalent to moderate-high doses of inhaled steroids. Doses of prednisolone &lt; 7.5 mg/day and any alternate day dose appear to be less effective than even moderate dose inhaled steroids.</P>
<P>If this review is correct in concluding that prednisolone 7.5 -10 mg/day has efficacy equivalent to that from moderate dose inhaled steroids, the next question concerns side-effects. Unfortunately data from the trials reviewed here give no information concerning this important issue. Few side-effects would be expected at the doses used in most of these studies over the short time treatment times studied. Thus, even if side effects were reported, they would give little indication of the long term probability of side-effects. To complement the efficacy data reviewed here, side-effects of long term oral steroids in the doses used here can only be obtained from other studies, most probably in diseases other than asthma. There will, however, be problems when extrapolating from other diseases in which there may be an interaction between disease-effects and side-effects, for example in rheumatoid arthritis. Age will also be important since steroid side-effects such as cataracts, diabetes and osteoporosis may be age dependent. In <LINK REF="STD-BTTA-1975" TYPE="STUDY">BTTA 1975</LINK>, 30% of patients reported side-effects such as oedema, dyspepsia, cushingoid appearance and weight gain from 5 mg of prednisone and none from the inhaled therapy. However, inhaled therapy also has metabolic side-effects. In <LINK REF="STD-Toogood-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Toogood 1989</LINK>, the systemic potency of 1 mg/day of budesonide was found equivalent to 9.2 mg/day of prednisone by measuring serum cortisol and peripheral blood eosinophils. Other studies have shown a 13.6% reduction in total body calcium in asthma patients receiving a mean of 6.8 mg oral corticosteroid for an average of 12.5 years and which would predispose to osteoporotic fractures (<LINK REF="REF-Reid-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reid 1986</LINK>). However another study of 550 patients found no serious complications of prednisone therapy where the majority of patients were taking 15 mg/day or less (<LINK REF="REF-Smyllie-1968" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smyllie 1968</LINK>). In this context, it should be noted that inhaled steroids do have side-effects themselves. A recent Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-Sharek-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sharek 1999</LINK>) has shown that linear growth is reduced in children with asthma given beclomethasone 400 mcg/day .</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>What practical advice can be given to the doctor practicing in a developing country scenario? A daily dose of prednisolone 7.5-10 mg/day appears to be equivalent to moderate-high dose inhaled corticosteroids. Alternate-day doses of oral steroids and doses &lt; 5 mg/day appear to be less effective than low-moderate dose inhaled steroids. No information about the long term side-effects of oral steroids in asthma are available, so if there is no alternative to oral steroids, the lowest effective dose (which appears to be 7.5 mg/day) should be prescribed.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>This review demonstrates that there is little evidence to accurately determine the therapeutically equivalent dosage of inhaled and oral steroids. Would it be ethically justified to recommend that further research be done to determine this equivalence? The answer to this question hinges on the assessment of risk attached to the use of oral steroids relative to inhaled. A systematic review of the side-effects of inhaled and low dose oral steroids is needed before this question can be answered. </P>
