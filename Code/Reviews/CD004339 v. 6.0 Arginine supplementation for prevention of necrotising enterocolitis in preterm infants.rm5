<P>
<B>What is the issue? </B>Necrotising enterocolitis (NEC) is a condition in which inflammation damages an infant's gastrointestinal (GI) tract. The rate of NEC ranges from 4% to 22% in very low birth weight infants. Necrotising enterocolitis may be caused by an infant's immaturity, lack of blood flow to the GI tract and surface (mucosa) breakdown resulting from infection or feeding with formula. To protect the GI tract, the body makes a natural substance - nitric oxide - from the amino acid arginine. Plasma arginine concentrations are reported to be low in very low birth weight infants and preterm infants who develop NEC. Adding extra arginine to the feeding solution may prevent NEC.</P>
<P>
<B>Why is this important? </B>NEC can result in permanent damage to the intestine, the need for multiple surgeries, prolonged hospital stay, death and increased cost to the healthcare system.</P>
<P>
<B>What evidence did we find? </B>Review authors searched the literature for controlled studies evaluating the efficacy and safety of arginine supplementation. Adding extra arginine to a preterm infant's feed reduced the risk of NEC in three good quality studies that included 285 infants born at less than 34 weeks' gestation. Six infants had to be treated, for one to benefit from treatment. Researchers reported no significant side effects directly attributable to too much arginine in the first 28 days, and one study reported no long-term (36 months) developmental delays. Possible effects of supplementing arginine include lower blood pressure and changes in blood glucose control.</P>
<P>
<B>What does this mean? </B>Arginine supplementation may reduce the incidence and severity of NEC in preterm infants. Results are limited, as studies included only a few patients. A large study that includes infants from multiple centres is needed to verify these findings.</P>

<P>We used the standard search strategy of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group to search the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2016, Issue 4), MEDLINE via PubMed (from 1966 to 12 May 2016), Embase (from 1980 to 12 May 2016) and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL; from 1982 to 12 May 2016). We also searched clinical trials databases, conference proceedings and reference lists of retrieved articles for randomised controlled trials and quasi-randomised trials<B>.</B>

<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2016-11-20 20:23:07 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We assessed the methodological quality of trials by using information obtained from study reports and through personal communication with study authors.

</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-11-21 05:02:33 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We identified three eligible studies that included a total of 285 neonates (140 received arginine) from three countries. We assessed the overall methodological quality of the included studies as good. We noted a statistically significant reduction in risk of development of NEC (any stage) among preterm neonates in the arginine group compared with the placebo group (RR 0.38, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.23 to 0.64; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 27%) (RD -0.19, 95% CI -0.28 to -0.10; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%) and rated the quality of evidence as moderate. The number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) as required to prevent the development of NEC (any stage) was 6 (95% CI 4 to 10). Study results showed a statistically significant reduction in risk of development of NEC stage 1 (RR 0.37, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.90; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 52%) (RD -0.07, 95% CI -0.14 to -0.01; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%) and NEC stage 3 (RR 0.13, 95% CI 0.02 to 1.03; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%) (RD -0.05, 95% CI -0.09 to -0.01; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 89%) in the arginine group compared with the control group; the quality of evidence was moderate.</P>
<P>Arginine supplementation was associated with a significant reduction in death related to NEC (RR 0.18, 95% CI 0.03 to 1.00; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%) (RD -0.05, 95% CI -0.09 to -0.01; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 87%). Results showed clinical heterogeneity in mortality rates. Mortality due to any cause was not significantly different between arginine and control or no treatment groups (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.41 to 1.45; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 42%) (RD -0.03, 95% CI -0.10 to 0.04; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 79%). Investigators noted no significant side effects directly attributable to arginine, including hypotension or alterations in glucose homeostasis. Follow-up data from one trial revealed no statistically significant differences in adverse outcomes (cerebral palsy, cognitive delay, bilateral blindness or hearing loss requiring hearing aids) at 36 months. Limitations of the present findings include a relatively small overall sample size.</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2016-11-20 20:31:21 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Administration of arginine to preterm infants may prevent development of NEC. Because information was provided by three small trials that included 285 participants, the data are insufficient at present to support a practice recommendation. A multi-centre randomised controlled study that is focused on the incidence of NEC, particularly at more severe stages (2 and 3), is needed.<BR/>

<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Bell-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bell 1978</LINK> reported that necrotising enterocolitis (NEC) occurs in three different stages; this report was later modified (<LINK REF="REF-Walsh-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walsh 1986</LINK>). Clinical features of NEC vary from constitutional symptoms such as feeding intolerance to severe systemic symptoms including cardiorespiratory decompensation, coagulopathy, peritonitis and ascites with or without pneumoperitoneum. As the result of marked variability in clinical manifestations, the reported incidence of NEC varies from 4% to 22% among very low birth weight infants at various centres (<LINK REF="REF-Stoll-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stoll 1994</LINK>).</P>
<P>The exact cause of NEC is unknown. Suspected pathophysiological mechanisms include immaturity, ischaemia, disruption of mucosal integrity, formula feeding, hyperosmolar load to intestine, infection and bacterial translocation (<LINK REF="REF-Caplan-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Caplan 2001</LINK>). Animal experiments have shown that subsequent to ischaemia, intestinal permeability is increased (<LINK REF="REF-Langer-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Langer 1993</LINK>), and this may lead to passage of bacteria and endotoxins into the intestinal wall, affecting mucosal integrity. Intestinal dysmotility and disruption in mucosal integrity play important roles in the pathogenesis of NEC (<LINK REF="REF-Di-Lorenzo-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Di Lorenzo 1995</LINK>).</P>
<P>Nitric oxide is important for normal gastrointestinal (GI) function from several perspectives. First, nitric oxide is an important regulator of vasomotor function (<LINK REF="REF-Stark-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stark 1992</LINK>). An inadequate concentration of nitric oxide leads to vasoconstriction of the intestinal vessels, which might result in ischaemia and a predisposition to NEC. Second, nitric oxide acts as a neurotransmitter for enteric non-adrenergic non-cholinergic neurons that regulate peristalsis (<LINK REF="REF-Boeckxstaens-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boeckxstaens 1991</LINK>). Lack or inadequacy of nitric oxide can alter intestinal motility. Third, nitric oxide inhibits leucocyte adherence and modulates inflammatory responses to various insults within the intestine (<LINK REF="REF-Akisu-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Akisu 2002</LINK>). Therefore, normal concentrations of nitric oxide must be maintained within the GI tract. Owing to its volatile nature, nitric oxide cannot be delivered to the GI tract in its original form. An indirect method of achieving adequate concentration involves supplementing substrates such as arginine to promote production.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2016-11-21 05:07:39 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Arginine is an amino acid that is a precursor for proteins (<LINK REF="REF-Wu-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wu 1998</LINK>) and nitric oxide synthase. The availability of plasma arginine is important for formation of nitric oxide (<LINK REF="REF-Castillo-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Castillo 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zamora-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zamora 1998</LINK>). Plasma arginine concentration was found to be 95 ± 25 &#956;mol/L in term breast-fed (N = 16) infants (<LINK REF="REF-Wu-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wu 1986</LINK>). In extremely low birth weight infants (birth weight &lt; 1000 grams) who were given formula feeds (N = 2), the mean arginine concentration was found to be 37 &#956;mol/L (range 13 to 60 &#956;mol/L), and the mean arginine concentration was 53 &#956;mol/L (range 3 to 116 &#956;mol/L) in breast-fed (N = 9) infants (<LINK REF="REF-Ventura-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ventura 1987</LINK>). In a case control study (<LINK REF="REF-Becker-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Becker 2000</LINK>), researchers found that arginine and glutamine levels were similar at day 3, but were significantly lower at days 7 and 14 in infants who developed NEC. <LINK REF="REF-Zamora-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zamora 1997</LINK> reported statistically significantly reduced plasma arginine concentrations in preterm infants who developed NEC compared with control infants, even after adjustments were made for intake of arginine and day of life. Recommended minimum and maximum concentrations of arginine in preterm infant formula are 72 mg/100 kcal and 104 mg/100 kcal, respectively (<LINK REF="REF-Klein-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Klein 2002</LINK>). These requirements are greater in infants who are stressed owing to higher utilisation in conditions such as NEC or pulmonary hypertension. The concentration of arginine found in formula today is 47 to 51 mg/100 kcal (according to manufacturer specifications). Therefore, preterm infants have low levels of arginine and low intake. Supplementation of arginine may help prevent NEC by promoting nitric oxide synthesis.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2016-11-20 21:41:23 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In an experimental model of hypoxaemia/reoxygenation-induced NEC in mice, dietary supplementation of arginine had a protective effect, as evidenced by lower injury scores on histopathological examination (<LINK REF="REF-Akisu-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Akisu 2002</LINK>). In a piglet model of NEC, continuous infusion of arginine reduced the severity of intestinal injury (<LINK REF="REF-Di-Lorenzo-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Di Lorenzo 1995</LINK>). However, in a rat model of ischaemia-reperfusion injury, investigators found that nitric oxide did not play a protective role in the immature or newborn intestine (<LINK REF="REF-Chan-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chan 2002</LINK>). Therefore, conflicting results have been reported when animal experiments were conducted to determine the role of nitric oxide in the pathogenesis of NEC.</P>
<P>Arginine supplementation can cause alterations in glucose homeostasis (both hypoglycaemia and hyperglycaemia) and histaminergic side effects (<LINK REF="REF-Vosatka-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vosatka 1994</LINK>). Researchers found that inhibition of nitric oxide synthesis reduced hypotension in rats with endotoxin-mediated septic shock; thus promotion of nitric oxide synthesis in infants with sepsis may lead to irreversible septic shock (<LINK REF="REF-Thiemermann-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thiemermann 1990</LINK>). This makes it imperative that any human studies of arginine supplementation to prevent NEC should be rigorously evaluated for both benefit and risk.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2016-11-20 21:43:21 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The objective of this review was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of arginine supplementation in decreasing the incidence of all stages of NEC among preterm neonates. As the rise in plasma levels of arginine depends on the dose of arginine used, we planned a subgroup analysis based on the dose of arginine administered. In addition, as the baseline incidence of NEC is low among infants after 32 weeks' gestation, we planned a subgroup analysis based on this cut-off for the purpose of examining the efficacy of arginine in infants of lower gestational age.</P>

<P>We identified three eligible studies - <LINK REF="STD-Amin-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Amin 2002</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Polycarpou-2013a" TYPE="STUDY">Polycarpou 2013a</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-El_x002d_Shimi-2015" TYPE="STUDY">El-Shimi 2015</LINK> (<LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>). We have provided clinical details of participants, interventions and outcomes in the <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK> table.</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Amin-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Amin 2002</LINK>, investigators randomised preterm neonates at &#8804; 32 weeks and at &#8804; 1250 grams to receive L-arginine (1.5 mmol/kg/d) or placebo (normal saline) in equivalent volume. Researchers added L-arginine to the parenteral nutrition solution until infants were able to tolerate more than 40% of feeds, after which investigators provided L-arginine or placebo supplementation via the enteral route. Researchers administered study medication at between two and five days of age and continued the medication until 28 days of age. The goal was to increase plasma arginine concentrations from a baseline level of 99 &#956;mol/L to 164 &#956;mol/L (upper limit of normal in healthy full-term breast-fed infants was 148 &#956;mol/L). Other clinical management decisions were left to the clinical care team responsible for the participants. Investigators enrolled a total of 152 participants (75 in the L-arginine group and 77 in the placebo group).</P>
<P>The primary outcome assessed in <LINK REF="STD-Amin-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Amin 2002</LINK> was the incidence of NEC (stage 1, 2 and 3, according to <LINK REF="REF-Bell-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bell 1978</LINK>). Secondary outcomes assessed included incidences of various stages of NEC, death due to NEC, death due to any cause and concentrations of arginine, glutamine and ammonia at baseline and at 14 and 28 days of age. Both groups recorded incidences of IVH, sepsis, hypotension and PDA and followed up all survivors until completion of the study (28 days of age). They reported long-term outcome data in abstract format and published a report of the follow-up study in 2009 (<LINK REF="STD-Amin-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Amin 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Polycarpou-2013a" TYPE="STUDY">Polycarpou 2013a</LINK>, researchers randomised preterm neonates at &#8804; 34 weeks and at &#8804; 1500 grams to receive L-arginine (1.5 mmol/kg/d) or placebo (5% glucose in equivalent volume). They provided L-arginine in liquid form in two equal doses, with nasogastric tube enteral feeds from three to 28 days of age. Investigators commenced enteral feeds at 10 to 25 mL/kg/d on the first day of life and increased these feeds on day 4 up to a maximum tolerance of 150 to 180 mL/kg/d. This study enrolled a total of 83 participants (40 in the L-arginine group and 43 in the placebo group).</P>
<P>The primary outcome in <LINK REF="STD-Polycarpou-2013a" TYPE="STUDY">Polycarpou 2013a</LINK> was the incidence of NEC (all stages according to <LINK REF="REF-Bell-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bell 1978</LINK>) in the first three months of life. Secondary outcomes assessed included age at NEC diagnosis and age at death due to NEC. Both groups evaluated the incidences of IVH, respiratory distress and PDA. Researchers monitored the intervention group for arginine-related side effects (diarrhoea, vomiting, low blood pressure and hypo/hyperglycaemia). A previous report revealed levels of faecal calprotectin in these 83 neonates (<LINK REF="REF-Polycarpou-2013b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Polycarpou 2013b</LINK>).</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-El_x002d_Shimi-2015" TYPE="STUDY">El-Shimi 2015</LINK>, researchers randomised 75 neonates born at &#8804; 34 weeks to three study arms: arginine (N = 25), glutamine (N = 25) and no treatment (control; N = 25). They administered L-arginine orally or via nasogastric tube, starting with the introduction of enteral feeds until day 30 of postnatal life. The primary outcome assessed in <LINK REF="STD-El_x002d_Shimi-2015" TYPE="STUDY">El-Shimi 2015</LINK> was the incidence of any stage of NEC from the time of enrolment to discharge, death or completion of 30 days of life.</P>
<P>These studies were conducted in three different settings: Canada (<LINK REF="STD-Amin-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Amin 2002</LINK>), Egypt (<LINK REF="STD-El_x002d_Shimi-2015" TYPE="STUDY">El-Shimi 2015</LINK>) and Greece (<LINK REF="STD-Polycarpou-2013a" TYPE="STUDY">Polycarpou 2013a</LINK>). The baseline population was &#8804; 32 weeks in <LINK REF="STD-Amin-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Amin 2002</LINK> and &#8804; 34 weeks in the remaining two studies. However, baseline rates of any NEC were 17% (<LINK REF="STD-Amin-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Amin 2002</LINK>), 18% (<LINK REF="STD-El_x002d_Shimi-2015" TYPE="STUDY">El-Shimi 2015</LINK>) and 30% (<LINK REF="STD-Polycarpou-2013a" TYPE="STUDY">Polycarpou 2013a</LINK>). Thus, we anticipated a degree of clinical heterogeneity in the results. However, we found little methodological heterogeneity between studies (all of which were relatively well-conducted RCTs) and lower risk of bias. Thus, we decided to pool results statistically and to explore heterogeneity if identified by using a random-effects model.</P>

<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Amin-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Amin 2002</LINK>, the pharmacist performed randomisation centrally (information provided by study author - Dr Amin). In this study, allocation was concealed and the intervention was masked, so that investigators, parents and caretakers were unaware of treatment allocation. Cross-over was not allowed (information provided by study author - Dr Amin) and contamination was not possible because the study drug was not available outside the trial. Outcome assessors (at various stages of NEC before study completion) were blinded and were not aware of treatment allocation. All randomised patients were accounted for in the analysis of outcomes.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Amin-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Amin 2002</LINK> reported outcomes among survivors at 36 months' postmenstrual age. Individuals who assessed outcomes at follow-up were blinded to the intervention. Among 145 infants eligible for follow-up, 135 (93%) were followed.</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Polycarpou-2013a" TYPE="STUDY">Polycarpou 2013a</LINK>, the randomisation sequence was computer generated, as described in <LINK REF="REF-Polycarpou-2013b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Polycarpou 2013b</LINK>. A pharmacist prepared intervention and control solutions in non-transparent bottles at equal volumes, meaning that nurses who administered the dilutions were blinded to the allocated intervention. Neonatalogists and radiologists evaluating x-rays of the abdomen were also blinded to the treatment arm. All participants were accounted for in the analysis of outcomes. Investigators included an additional evaluation of neonates whose parents declined consent.</P>
<P>Researchers in <LINK REF="STD-El_x002d_Shimi-2015" TYPE="STUDY">El-Shimi 2015 </LINK>used a simple, computer-generated randomisation approach and concealed allocation (information obtained from study author - Dr Khafagy). Participants, attending physicians, nurses and data analysts were blinded to the group to which babies were assigned (information obtained from study author - Dr Khafagy). Investigators reported all outcomes and accounted for all randomised participants in the analysis of outcomes. It is difficult to understand blinding of nurses and doctors involved in the study to interventions, as the control group received no intervention. We contacted study authors to request clarification but received no response.</P>

Baseline arginine levels were significantly lower in the arginine group (6.1 ng/mL vs 8.4 ng/mL; P = 0.009). In both groups, plasma arginine levels significantly increased over the 14-day period. Baseline and day 14 arginine levels were reported in <LINK REF="STD-El_x002d_Shimi-2015" TYPE="STUDY">El-Shimi 2015</LINK> as median and interquartile range (IQR).

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2016-11-21 05:12:20 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We conducted an extensive literature search to identify trials that might qualify for inclusion in this review. However, we identified only three trials (<LINK REF="STD-Amin-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Amin 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-El_x002d_Shimi-2015" TYPE="STUDY">El-Shimi 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Polycarpou-2013a" TYPE="STUDY">Polycarpou 2013a</LINK>). The number of neonates included in this analysis was 285. It appears from these studies that arginine may be effective in preventing necrotising enterocolitis (NEC).</P>
<P>The overall quality of the included studies was good, suggesting that extracted data were valid. However, review authors noted some issues of concern. In <LINK REF="STD-Amin-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Amin 2002</LINK>, the incidence of NEC in the control group was 27.3% - a rate well above that (5% to 10%) reported by studies including similar populations. Study authors included stage 1 NEC as an outcome, but diagnosis of this disorder is highly subjective and non-specific. Use of stage 1 NEC as an outcome in a prophylactic study is questionable owing to the inherent possibility of over-diagnosis (i.e. labelling cases as NEC when patients do not have NEC). Because of masking in this study, it is unlikely that any such over-diagnosis was biased. Factors responsible for the high incidence of NEC at this centre are unknown. When only participants with stage 2 NEC were analysed, a trend towards reduction that was not statistically significant was noted. Lack of significance of these post hoc analyses may be due to reduced sample size at each stage. Follow-up reports reveal no increase in risk of neurodevelopmental impairment among survivors.</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-El_x002d_Shimi-2015" TYPE="STUDY">El-Shimi 2015</LINK>, neonates who developed NEC were of significantly lower gestational age and weight. Owing to the small sample size, study authors were unable to apply regression modelling, which presented a limitation in interpretation, as the effects of arginine cannot be isolated. Results of this study showed a significant baseline imbalance in the control group, which included smaller neonates (based on birth weight) with significantly higher baseline arginine levels. A larger sample size may have resulted in groups that were more comparable.</P>
<P>Based on data provided by the three included studies, we have downgraded recommendations for the use of arginine to prevent NEC to moderate. The included studies are of good methodological design, are consistent in their findings regarding the overall incidence of NEC and appear free of publication bias. We noted minor sources of indirectness related to populations examined in the included studies (&lt; 32 weeks vs &lt; 34 weeks) and to composition of the comparator (placebo-glucose vs placebo-saline vs no treatment); however, we believe this would not affect the overall strength of the recommendation. We downgraded evidence as the result of imprecision resulting from the relatively small sample size. We graded evidence on the use of arginine supplementation to reduce mortality to low owing to clinical heterogeneity in baseline mortality rates, likely reflecting variation in population demographics and perinatal health services across regions.</P>
<P>Arginine supplementation for prevention of NEC could be an important avenue for further research. However, the sample size required for prevention of stage 2 or 3 NEC will be significantly larger than the sample previously studied (for an absolute risk reduction of 50% from a baseline incidence of 6%, with an alpha of 0.05 and power of 0.8, each arm would have to include 750 participants), requiring a multi-centre design. The fact that researchers in <LINK REF="STD-Amin-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Amin 2002</LINK> were able to demonstrate reduced concentrations of arginine among patients who develop NEC compared with those who do not develop NEC points towards the possibility of increased utilisation or reduced absorption of the substrate, thereby supporting the rationale for undertaking such a study. Conversely, <LINK REF="STD-El_x002d_Shimi-2015" TYPE="STUDY">El-Shimi 2015</LINK> reported similar arginine levels at the time of enrolment among neonates who developed NEC compared with those who did not. The findings of <LINK REF="STD-El_x002d_Shimi-2015" TYPE="STUDY">El-Shimi 2015</LINK> may be confounded by baseline imbalances and significantly higher arginine concentrations in the control group at the time of enrolment.</P>
<P>Results showed no significant side effects with supplementation of arginine at a dose of 1.5 mmol/kg, despite arginine levels that were marginally higher than those of normal breast-fed term newborn infants. This finding further supports the rationale for future research.</P>

<P>The following issues were evaluated and entered into the risk of bias table:<BR/>1. Sequence generation (checking for possible selection bias): Was the allocation sequence adequately generated?<BR/>
<BR/>For each included study, we categorised the method used to generate the allocation sequence as:<BR/>a. low risk (any truly random process, e.g. random number table; computer random number generator);<BR/>b. high risk (any non-random process, e.g. odd or even date of birth; hospital or clinic record number); or<BR/>c. unclear risk.<BR/>
<BR/>2. Allocation concealment (checking for possible selection bias): Was allocation adequately concealed?<BR/>
<BR/>For each included study, we categorised the method used to conceal the allocation sequence as:<BR/>a. low risk (e.g. telephone or central randomisation; consecutively numbered sealed opaque envelopes);<BR/>b. high risk (open random allocation; unsealed or non-opaque envelopes, alternation; date of birth); or<BR/>c. unclear risk.<BR/>
<BR/>3. Blinding of participants and personnel (checking for possible performance bias): Was knowledge of the allocated intervention adequately prevented during the study?<BR/>
<BR/>For each included study, we categorised the method used to blind study participants and personnel from knowledge of which intervention a participant received. Blinding was assessed separately for different outcomes or classes of outcomes. We categorised methods as:<BR/>a. low risk for participants or personnel;<BR/>b. high risk for participants or personnel; or<BR/>c. unclear risk for participants or personnel.<BR/>
<BR/>4. Blinding of outcome assessment (checking for possible detection bias): Was knowledge of the allocated intervention adequately prevented at the time of outcome assessment?<BR/>
<BR/>For each included study, we categorised the method used to blind outcome assessors from knowledge of which intervention a participant received. Blinding was assessed separately for different outcomes or classes of outcomes. We categorised methods as:<BR/>a. low risk for outcome assessors;<BR/>b. high risk for outcome assessors; or<BR/>c. unclear risk for outcome assessors.<BR/>
<BR/>5. Incomplete outcome data (checking for possible attrition bias through withdrawals, dropouts, protocol deviations). Were incomplete outcome data adequately addressed?<BR/>
<BR/>For each included study and for each outcome, we described completeness of data, including attrition and exclusions from analysis. We noted whether attrition and exclusions were reported, numbers included in the analysis at each stage (compared with the total number of randomised participants), reasons for attrition or exclusion when reported and whether missing data were balanced across groups or were related to outcomes. When sufficient information was reported or supplied by trial authors, we re-included missing data in the analyses. We categorised methods as:<BR/>a. low risk (&lt; 20% missing data);<BR/>b. high risk (&#8805; 20% missing data); or<BR/>c. unclear risk.<BR/>
<BR/>6. Selective reporting bias. Are reports of the study free of the suggestion of selective outcome reporting?<BR/>
<BR/>For each included study, we described how we investigated the possibility of selective outcome reporting bias and what we found. We assessed methods as:<BR/>a. low risk (when it is clear that all of the study&#8217;s prespecified outcomes and all expected outcomes of interest to the review have been reported);<BR/>b. high risk (when not all of the study&#8217;s prespecified outcomes have been reported; one or more reported primary outcomes were not prespecified; outcomes of interest were reported incompletely and so cannot be used; study failed to include results of a key outcome that would have been expected to have been reported); or<BR/>c. unclear risk.<BR/>
<BR/>7. Other sources of bias. Was the study apparently free of other problems that could put it at high risk of bias?<BR/>
<BR/>For each included study, we described any important concerns that we had about other possible sources of bias (e.g. whether a potential source of bias was related to the specific study design, whether the trial was stopped early owing to some data-dependent process). We assessed whether each study was free of other problems that could put it at risk of bias as:<BR/>a. low risk;<BR/>b. high risk; or<BR/>c. unclear risk.</P>
<P>
<BR/>If needed, we planned to explore the impact of the level of bias by undertaking sensitivity analyses.<BR/>
