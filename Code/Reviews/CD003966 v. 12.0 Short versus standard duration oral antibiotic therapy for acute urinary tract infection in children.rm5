<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2009-01-06 13:26:51 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Bladder and kidney infections (urinary tract infections - UTI) are common in children. Bladder infections cause pain on passing urine and frequency of urination. Some children keep getting repeat bouts. Standard courses of antibiotics (7-10 days) are used to clear the infection. Shorter courses may reduce adverse effects and costs, but there has been concern that they might reduce the chances of clearing the infection and increase the risk of recurrence. A review of studies found that short courses of antibiotics (2-4 days) used for bladder infections are as effective as standard courses at clearing UTI, with no increase in recurrence.</P>

There was no significant difference between short and standard duration therapy in the development of resistant organisms in UTI at the end of treatment (one study: RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.32 to 1.01) or in recurrent UTI (three studies: RR 0.39, 95% CI 0.12 to 1.29).</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2009-01-06 13:26:58 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The optimal duration of therapy for urinary tract infection (UTI) in children has not been determined. Given the current pressure for cost savings and the possible benefits of diminished selection of resistant organisms, along with the realities of patient compliance, short-course therapy for uncomplicated lower tract UTI is appealing. A number of studies have compared single dose therapy to standard therapy for UTI, with mixed results (<LINK REF="REF-Moffatt-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moffatt 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shapiro-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shapiro 1982</LINK>). Expert opinion has generally been against single dose therapy because of apparently higher relapse rates. A course of antibiotics longer than a single dose but shorter than the usual 7-10 days might decrease the relapse rate and still provide some of the benefits of a shortened course of antibiotics. This recommendation has been made in review articles by a number of experts, but clear evidence for the recommendation has been lacking.</P>
<P>Two reviews of single dose and short-course therapy were published in the 1980s. <LINK REF="REF-Shapiro-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shapiro 1982</LINK> concluded that too few children had been studied to justify the routine use of short-course therapy. <LINK REF="REF-Moffatt-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moffatt 1988</LINK> reviewed the eight studies that <LINK REF="REF-Shapiro-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shapiro 1982</LINK> included, added six additional studies and provided a thorough discussion of the methodological quality of the included studies. <LINK REF="REF-Moffatt-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moffatt 1988</LINK> found that the studies best meeting methodological criteria found single dose therapy to be significantly worse than conventional therapy, but concluded that there was insufficient evidence regarding other short-course therapy, and recommended that a larger study be done. During the preparation of this systematic review, two further reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Keren-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Keren 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tran-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tran 2001</LINK>) of single dose and short-course therapy involving 22 and 17 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) respectively, have been published. The results in both reviews showed single dose therapy to be less effective than standard duration therapy but found no statistical difference in cure rate between short and standard duration therapy. Both reviews included studies which used different antibiotics in the short and standard treatment duration groups. <LINK REF="REF-Tran-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tran 2001</LINK> concluded that short-course (three days) trimethoprim/sulphamethizole appeared to be an effective alternative treatment to standard duration therapy for lower tract UTI. In contrast <LINK REF="REF-Keren-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Keren 2002</LINK> concluded that because of few studies, short duration therapy should not be considered and the current practice of treating children with lower tract UTI with 7-14 days of antibiotics should be continued.</P>
<P>The objective of this systematic review was to summarise the evidence regarding the effects of short-course (2-4 days) compared to standard duration (7-14 days) oral antibiotic treatment using the same antibiotic on the persistence of UTI at the end of treatment and on the recurrence of UTI after treatment.</P>

For the MEDLINE and EMBASE searches, the citations retrieved were combined with the optimally sensitive search strategies of the Cochrane Collaboration for RCTs (<LINK REF="REF-Dickersin-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dickersin 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lefebvre-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lefebvre 1996</LINK>). References of review articles and retrieved studies were also searched for eligible studies and known investigators in the area were contacted for published and unpublished studies. Abstracts were reviewed for those articles whose title indicated that the subject of the study was antibiotic therapy for UTIs. If the abstract indicated that the study evaluated duration of therapy for UTI, the entire article was examined to determine whether the inclusion criteria were met (s<I>ee </I>

<P>Three potential sources of heterogeneity of treatment effect were to be explored using subgroup analysis where there were sufficient studies to analyse: treatment, participant, and study quality variability. Attempts were made to assess treatment differences (duration of antibiotic administration, year of treatment, and different antibiotics given) and participant differences (age, gender and associated anomalies). Study quality was evaluated as noted above.</P>
<P>Statistical analyses were performed using the random effects model and the results were expressed as risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). The fixed effects model was also analysed to ensure robustness of the model chosen and susceptibility to outliers. Heterogeneity of treatment effects was explored using Cochran's Q statistic with an alpha of 0.1 used for statistical significance using the pre-specified sources by subgroup analysis but meta-regression was not feasible. The summary estimates were translated into absolute risk reduction (ARR) for a range of feasible baseline risks for the cure rate.</P>

Ninety children, who received three days of pivmecillinam, were excluded from the meta-analyses because there was no long duration comparison group (<LINK REF="STD-CSG-1991" TYPE="STUDY">CSG 1991</LINK>). Problems in study design and reporting were common (<LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK> - <I>Quality of included </I>studies<I> comparing short with standard duration antibiotic</I>). Randomisation was adequately concealed in only two studies (<LINK REF="STD-CSG-1991" TYPE="STUDY">CSG 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Johnson-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Johnson 1993</LINK>); in the remaining studies sufficient information was not provided to determine whether allocation was adequately concealed.

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2009-01-06 13:29:09 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In children with lower tract UTI, no significant difference was found between short (2-4 days) and standard duration (7-14 days) oral antibiotic therapy in the number of children with persistent bacteriuria at the end of treatment or in the number of children with UTI recurrence one month to 15 months after treatment. No data were available on the relative efficacies of short and standard duration therapies on the resolution of clinical symptoms. Data on the development of resistant organisms was reported in only three studies. There is an increase in prevalence in UTI of organisms resistant to commonly used antibiotics (<LINK REF="REF-Gupta-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gupta 1999</LINK>). Therefore the possible trend towards a reduction in the number of children with resistant organisms following short duration therapy needs further study in RCTs. It was not possible to determine if short duration therapy offered any reduction in antibiotic related adverse effects. Detailed data on compliance with medications in each treatment group were not provided in any study. No study addressed whether using short-course therapy reduced costs.</P>
<P>Though there was no significant difference in the rate of bacteriuria at the end of treatment, the wide confidence intervals of the summary estimate (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.76) indicate residual imprecision in the results. Ideally a further adequately powered study is required. Approximately 1% to 3% of unselected children treated for symptomatic UTI still have a UTI after 7-14 days of antibiotic treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Craig-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Craig 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Winberg-1974" TYPE="REFERENCE">Winberg 1974</LINK>). To demonstrate a reduction in UTI after treatment from 3% to 2% or from 1% to 0.5%, 8,000 and 10,000 children respectively would need to be enrolled. Since it is highly improbable that such a study will be performed, clinicians must use currently available data to determine the treatment duration that they should use. The relevance of the residual uncertainty to patient care depends on the risk of persistent infection with standard duration therapy. Using the upper and lower limits of the 95% CI to define the best and worst case scenarios, in 1000 children with a 1% risk of infection at the end of treatment for their first UTI, four fewer children or eight extra children would have UTI following short duration therapy compared with standard duration - a clinically unimportant difference (<LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK> - <I>Estimated risk for UTI 0-10 days following short duration treatment</I>). All studies included in this systematic review included children with recurrent UTI and such children are known to be at a higher risk of UTI at the end of treatment compared with children with their first infection (<LINK REF="REF-Winberg-1974" TYPE="REFERENCE">Winberg 1974</LINK>). If the risk of infection following treatment is 14% with standard duration therapy, as in the included studies, then 50 fewer or 110 extra children would have UTI following short duration therapy - a difference that is clinically important. In populations with recurrent UTI and a higher risk of UTI at the end of treatment, the possible harms (delay in resolution of symptoms) of not clearing the infection would have to be weighed up against the possible benefits (reduced resistance to treating antibiotics, reduced adverse effects of antibiotics, improved compliance and reduced costs) of using a short-course of therapy.</P>
<P>Two non Cochrane Collaboration systematic reviews comparing single dose or short-course therapy with standard duration therapy have recently been published (<LINK REF="REF-Keren-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Keren 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tran-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tran 2001</LINK>). The review by <LINK REF="REF-Tran-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tran 2001</LINK> included 22 studies (13 short-course of which nine were also included in this review). The authors included studies which used different antibiotics in the short and standard treatment duration groups. They found no difference in cure rate (based on negative urine cultures taken four to 29 days after enrolment), between short (1-4 days) and standard duration (five days or more) therapy (13 studies: risk difference (RD) 4.26, 95% CI -0.95 to 9.48). Meta-analysis of a subset of six studies comparing trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (including three studies using single dose treatment) showed a similar cure rate using single dose/short duration as for treatment with five days or more (RD 6.24, 95% CI -3.74 to 16.2). The authors concluded that three days of treatment with trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole therapy appeared to be an effective therapy for lower UTI while single dose therapy was less effective. The review by <LINK REF="REF-Keren-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Keren 2002</LINK> included 17 studies of which six compared short course with standard duration (six of the 13 studies included by <LINK REF="REF-Tran-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tran 2001</LINK> and four of the 10 studies included in this review). Studies including children with asymptomatic UTI were excluded. The authors concluded that there was insufficient evidence to justify the use of short-course therapy because of the small numbers of studies and the wide confidence intervals around the summary estimates. However no difference in the number of children with treatment failure (persistent infection or relapse within two weeks) was found between short-course therapy (1-4 days) and standard (7-14 days) therapy (five studies: RR 1.36, 95% CI 0.68 to 2.72). Similarly there was no difference for UTI recurrence &gt; two weeks after therapy (four studies: RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.46 to 2.13). Thus three systematic reviews using slightly different inclusion criteria and timing of outcomes have found no difference in the relative efficacies of short and standard duration therapies for the treatment of lower tract UTI.</P>
<P>There are important limitations of this systematic review due to problems with the primary studies. Some information of most relevance to clinical care was not provided in these studies. None of the studies specified the time to symptom resolution after commencement of antibiotics and whether UTI at the end of treatment or UTI recurrence were associated with clinical symptoms. Two studies (<LINK REF="STD-CSG-1991" TYPE="STUDY">CSG 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jojart-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Jojart 1991</LINK>) enrolled both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients. Inclusion of these studies did not result in heterogeneity. It is now recommended that school age children with asymptomatic bacteriuria should not be treated with antibiotics since they are not at increased risk of impaired renal growth or deterioration in renal function (<LINK REF="REF-BSG-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">BSG 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hansson-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hansson 1989</LINK>) but are at increased risk of pyelonephritis following treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Hansson-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hansson 1989</LINK>). Children with pyelonephritis or known urinary tract pathology were excluded so no recommendations on treatment duration can be made for such children, who comprise a large proportion of children under five years with UTI (<LINK REF="REF-Craig-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Craig 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Winberg-1974" TYPE="REFERENCE">Winberg 1974</LINK>). Studies were generally small, included children from a wide age range and were of suboptimal quality. Studies with inadequate allocation or blinding can exaggerate the efficacy of experimental treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>) and meta-analyses of poor quality studies (<LINK REF="REF-Moher-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 1998</LINK>) can provide erroneous information on the benefits of therapy. Despite these methodological issues, no significant heterogeneity was demonstrated between study results. Formal testing for publication bias using funnel plots (<LINK REF="REF-Egger-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Egger 1997</LINK>) was not possible because of the small number of studies.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>Although this study has still not provided incontrovertible evidence that short duration (2-4 days) is better or worse than standard duration therapy (7-14 days) in eradicating childhood UTI because of residual imprecision, for most children with first UTI, who are at low risk (1% to 3%) of bacteriuria at the end of treatment with standard duration treatment, this statistical imprecision is of doubtful clinical significance. Therefore, based upon these data, short duration of treatment offers a reasonable option for children with lower tract UTI. </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Adequately powered RCTs are required to determine the efficacy of short-course treatment compared with standard duration treatment in children with recurrent symptomatic lower tract UTI and in children with pyelonephritis. Outcome measures should include clinical and bacteriological resolution of UTI, assessment of treatment duration on the development of resistant organisms causing UTI and on the resistance patterns to antibiotics shown by gut flora, assessment of outcome compliance, adverse effects and evaluation of any cost savings.</P>
