<TITLE>Cognitive behaviour therapy for chronic fatigue syndrome</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2008-05-13 14:27:38 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is a very common and disabling condition, in which people suffer from persistent symptoms of fatigue that are unexplained. Cognitive behaviour therapy is a psychological therapy model that is commonly used to treat a range of psychological and chronic pain conditions. This review aimed to find out whether CBT is effective for CBT, both as a standalone treatment and in combination with other treatments, and whether it is more effective than other treatments used for CFS. The review included 15 studies, with a total of 1043 CFS participants. The review showed that people attending for CBT were more likely to have reduced fatigue symptoms at the end of treatment than people who received usual care or were on a waiting list for therapy, with 40% of people in the CBT group showing clinical improvement, in contrast with 26% in usual care. At follow-up, 1-7 months after treatment ended, people who had completed their course of CBT continued to have lower fatigue levels, but when including people who had dropped out of treatment, there was no difference between CBT and usual care. The review also compared CBT against other types of psychological therapy, including relaxation techniques, counselling and support/education, and found that people attending for CBT was more likely to have reduced fatigue symptoms at the end of treatment than those attending for other psychological therapies. Physical functioning, depression, anxiety and psychological distress symptoms were also more reduced when compared with other psychological therapies. However at follow-up, the results were inconsistent and the studies did not fit well together, making it difficult to draw any conclusions. Very few studies reported on the acceptability of CBT and no studies examined side effects. Only two studies compared the effectiveness of CBT against other treatments, both exercise therapy, and just one study compared a combination of CBT and other treatments with usual care. More studies should be carried out to establish whether CBT is more helpful than other treatments for CFS, and whether CBT in combination with other treatments is more helpful than single treatment approaches.</P>

<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2008-05-08 22:39:03 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Data on patients, interventions and outcomes were extracted by two review authors independently, and risk of bias was assessed for each study. The primary outcome was reduction in fatigue severity, based on a continuous measure of symptom reduction, using the standardised mean difference (SMD), or a dichotomous measure of clinical response, using odds ratios (OR), with 95% confidence intervals (CI).</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2008-05-13 14:27:08 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Fifteen studies (1043 CFS participants) were included in the review. When comparing CBT with usual care (six studies, 373 participants), the difference in fatigue mean scores at post-treatment was highly significant in favour of CBT (SMD -0.39, 95% CI -0.60 to -0.19), with 40% of CBT participants (four studies, 371 participants) showing clinical response in contrast with 26% in usual care (OR 0.47, 95% CI 0.29 to 0.76). Findings at follow-up were inconsistent. For CBT versus other psychological therapies, comprising relaxation, counselling and education/support (four studies, 313 participants), the difference in fatigue mean scores at post-treatment favoured CBT (SMD -0.43, 95% CI -0.65 to -0.20). Findings at follow-up were heterogeneous and inconsistent. Only two studies compared CBT against other interventions and one study compared CBT in combination with other interventions against usual care.</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2008-05-13 14:27:24 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>CBT is effective in reducing the symptoms of fatigue at post-treatment compared with usual care, and may be more effective in reducing fatigue symptoms compared with other psychological therapies. The evidence base at follow-up is limited to a small group of studies with inconsistent findings. There is a lack of evidence on the comparative effectiveness of CBT alone or in combination with other treatments, and further studies are required to inform the development of effective treatment programmes for people with CFS.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2009-02-13 18:02:21 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2009-02-13 18:01:29 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is a condition characterised by persistent fatigue and significant associated disability, but without evident physical or psychological disorder to explain the problem. Sufferers endure fatigue which may cause considerable and persisting debility. They may also experience a lack of understanding from others, including health professionals. This may be exacerbated by normal or equivocal findings on physical examination or investigation despite the sufferer's experience of illness. It is an important health care issue, presenting major problems for both its sufferers and for health services.<BR/>
<BR/>Whilst fatigue is so common as to be almost a normal consequence of life (<LINK REF="REF-Ridsdale-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ridsdale 1989</LINK>), many of the population experience fatigue which is much more severe or long-lasting. About one in three of the UK population report substantial fatigue, and one in five report fatigue having been present for over six months (<LINK REF="REF-Cox-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cox 1987</LINK>). Some of these sufferers have physical or psychological disorders which cause fatigue. Nevertheless, a significant proportion of people with disabling and chronic fatigue appear to have a disorder which is medically unexplained. The term CFS describes this more defined, and serious, problem, which is thought to affect up to 1% of the general population (<LINK REF="REF-Wessely-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wessely 1995</LINK>), with a reported range of 0.006% up 3% depending on the setting and criteria used (<LINK REF="REF-Afari-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Afari 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>CFS has had many names in recent decades. These include Royal Free disease, Iceland disease, neurasthenia, myalgic encephalomyelitis ('ME'), and post-viral fatigue syndrome. All these appear to describe groups of patients with a similar problem, that is, persistent medically unexplained fatigue which causes disability and distress. The term CFS has been adopted and clearly defined in order to foster research on this common problem. Opinions regarding the cause have tended to focus on either mainly physical or mainly psychological explanations. There is increasing awareness in a range of illnesses of the potential interaction of physical and psychological factors in the development and maintenance of the disorder. Such illnesses include irritable bowel syndrome, low back pain and CFS.</P>
<P>Many people with CFS in the community attend their general practitioners for assessment and treatment. Some attend alternative practitioners, disappointed with the results of orthodox medical practice. Others are referred to out-patient clinics for assessment. Referral to a variety of specialist clinics, including general medicine, endocrinology, infectious diseases, neurology, and psychiatry, reflects uncertainty and, often, disagreement among doctors and sufferers about the causes of CFS. Sufferers' and professionals' struggle to understand the illness may lead to unsatisfactory patient-professional relationships, and dissatisfied patients.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2009-02-13 18:01:43 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Until recently, research studies have been unable to offer neither a convincing explanation of the causes of CFS nor evidence for effective treatments. Often, sufferers have been advised to limit the demands placed upon their bodies, in order to promote recovery and prevent deterioration, which may lead to further impairment of quality of life. Treatment strategies for CFS include psychological, physical and pharmacological interventions. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) have been carried out to assess the effectiveness of treatments as diverse as exercise therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Fulcher-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fulcher 1997</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Wearden-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wearden 1998</LINK>), self-help treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Chalder-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Chalder 1997</LINK>), antidepressants (<LINK REF="REF-Behan-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Behan 1995</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Vercoulen-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vercoulen 1996</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Wearden-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wearden 1998</LINK>) and dietary supplementation with fatty acids (<LINK REF="REF-Warren-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Warren 1999</LINK>) and folic acid (<LINK REF="REF-Kaslow-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kaslow 1989</LINK>). Over the last 15 years, an increasing number of trials for CFS have focused attention on psychological therapies, including supportive 'non-directive' interventions and treatments that draw from cognitive and behavioural approaches.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2009-02-13 18:01:58 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>First developed in the 1960s, and later manualised as cognitive therapy (CT) (<LINK REF="REF-Beck-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beck 1979</LINK>), cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) incorporates elements of both behavioural therapy (BT) and cognitive therapy approaches. CBT facilitates the identification of unhelpful, anxiety-provoking thoughts, and challenges these negative automatic thoughts and dysfunctional underlying assumptions through collaborative 'hypothesis-testing', using behavioural tasks of diary-keeping and validity-testing of beliefs between sessions, together with skills training within sessions.</P>
<P>For the treatment of CFS, CBT combines a rehabilitative approach of a graded increase in activity with a psychological approach addressing thoughts and beliefs about CFS that may impair recovery. A gradual increase in activity, negotiated and agreed with the patient, can be used as a 'behavioural experiment', in which core beliefs, such as about the link between increased activity and worsened physical symptoms, can be tested. Catastrophic interpretations of transient increases in physical symptoms can be challenged by orthodox cognitive therapy techniques, such as the 'double column technique', in which the original, anxious, unhelpful thought is written alongside new, more realistic, more helpful alternatives.</P>
<P>Recent developments in CBT include 'third wave' approaches, including mindfulness-based therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Kabat_x002d_Zinn-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kabat-Zinn 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Segal-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Segal 2002</LINK>), compassion-focused therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Gilbert-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gilbert 2005</LINK>) and acceptance and commitment therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Hayes-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hayes 2003</LINK>). Originally focusing on the treatment of depression (<LINK REF="REF-Segal-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Segal 2002</LINK>), and now being used with a number of other disorders, including CFS, mindfulness training incorporates meditation techniques and teaches participants to observe thoughts, emotions and sensations without trying to escape, avoid or change them (<LINK REF="REF-Kabat_x002d_Zinn-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kabat-Zinn 1991</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2009-02-13 18:02:11 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The current body of evidence for CBT remains limited to narrative synthesis within generic CFS reviews (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Chambers-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chambers 2006</LINK>) or to meta-analysis of mean effect sizes (<LINK REF="REF-Malouff-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Malouff 2008</LINK>). Furthermore, potential heterogeneity has been largely based on qualitative assessment and the impact of symptom severity and healthcare setting are uncertain moderators of effect (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2007</LINK>). An in-depth, up-to-date, systematic review of CBT alone and in combination with other treatments for CFS is of key importance to inform treatment decision by patients, clinicians and policy-makers. This review is central in a programme of Cochrane reviews for CFS, which also cover exercise therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Edmonds-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Edmonds 2004</LINK>), pharmacological treatments (<LINK REF="REF-Rawson-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rawson 2007</LINK>) and complementary approaches, including acupuncture (<LINK REF="REF-Zhang-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhang 2006</LINK>) and traditional Chinese herbal medicine (<LINK REF="REF-Adams-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Adams 2007</LINK>).</P>

<CRIT_STUDIES>
<P>All randomised controlled trials (RCTs), both published and unpublished, in any language, were included in the review.</P>
<P>Cluster RCTs, in which centres or therapists were randomised to intervention or control groups were included, provided that the specific aim of the study was to examine the effect of the intervention. </P>
</CRIT_STUDIES>
<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS MODIFIED="2009-02-13 18:19:57 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>
<B>Patient characteristics and setting</B>
<BR/>Trials of male and female participants over the age of 16 were included, irrespective of culture and setting</P>
<P>
<B>Diagnosis</B>
<BR/>Trials of patients who fulfilled the following diagnostic criteria for CFS were included:<BR/>1) fatigue was the principal symptom<BR/>2) the fatigue was medically unexplained, i.e. did not appear to be adequately explained by abnormalities found on examination or investigation, by diagnosed physical disorder, or by psychiatric disorder including eating disorders, alcohol or drug misuse, psychosis, bipolar affective disorder or severe depressive illness<BR/>3) the fatigue was of sufficient severity to significantly disable or distress the patient<BR/>4) the fatigue was over six months in duration*</P>
<P>Trials involving several disorders were included, provided that over 90% of the patients had a primary diagnosis of CFS according to the above criteria. Trials in which less than 90% of participants had a primary diagnosis of CFS were included in the review if data limited to CFS participants were provided</P>
<P>* Although there are a number of differences between diagnostic criteria used for CFS (<LINK REF="REF-Sharpe-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sharpe 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lloyd-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lloyd 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fukuda-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fukuda 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Carruthers-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carruthers 2003</LINK>), they are all consistent in specifying a duration of at least six months since onset.</P>
<P>
<B>Comorbidity</B>
<BR/>Studies involving participants with comorbid physical or common mental disorders were eligible for inclusion, as long as the comorbidity was secondary to the diagnosis of CFS. However, studies involving patients with a comorbid psychiatric diagnosis of substance-related disorder, schizophrenia or psychotic disorder were excluded.</P>
</CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS MODIFIED="2009-02-13 18:19:38 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>
<B>Intervention</B>
<BR/>Trials of experimental interventions which met the following criteria were included:<BR/>1) The psychological treatment(s) of interest incorporated attempted modification of thoughts and beliefs about symptoms and illness and attempted modification of behavioural responses to symptoms and illness, such as rest, sleep and activity.<BR/>2) The intervention was clearly described and was supported by appropriate references<BR/>3) No restrictions were imposed on the length of treatment, in terms of duration or number of sessions, or time between sessions<BR/>4) Both individual and group treatment modalities were eligible for inclusion</P>
<P>In the original version of the review, the way in which modification of thoughts, beliefs, rest, and activity was attempted was used to delineate two 'types' of CBT. 'Type A' attempted to increase activity and reduce rest time in a systematic manner, independent of symptoms, towards 'normal' levels. 'Type B' attempted to tailor the patient's rest and activity towards levels which were compatible with the limitations imposed by the disorder. Therefore, Type B CBT did not explicitly attempt to increase the patient's physical or psychological capacity beyond improving their ability to 'cope' with their disabilities.</P>
<P>For the purposes of updating the review, following discussion between the review authors, it was agreed that distinguishing between the two types of CBT described above was not feasible. This approach to categorising studies was therefore not adopted. Instead, interventions were categorised according to their theoretical underpinning, as follows:<BR/>1) Traditional CBT models, including cognitive behavioural approaches drawing from Beckian principles (<LINK REF="REF-Beck-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beck 1979</LINK>).<BR/>2) Recently developed CBT models, including mindfulness training (<LINK REF="REF-Kabat_x002d_Zinn-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kabat-Zinn 1991</LINK>), compassion-focused therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Gilbert-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gilbert 2005</LINK>) and acceptance and commitment therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Hayes-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hayes 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<B>Control conditions</B>
<BR/>The following control interventions were included:<BR/>1) Minimal or usual medical management (also sometimes described in trials as standard care, treatment as usual or waiting list), to be defined here as being elements of clinic attendance, investigation, reassurance, and simple advice, without explicit psychological therapy, and also including naturalistic prescribing of medication and/or other interventions<BR/>2) Immunological therapy, to include immunoglobulin, staphylococcus toxoid and interferon<BR/>3) Pharmacotherapy, to include hydrocortisone preparations and antidepressants (all classes)<BR/>4) Non-CBT psychological therapies, to include non-directive (supportive) therapies, behavioural relaxation training and psychodynamic therapy<BR/>5) Exercise as a stand-alone intervention<BR/>6) Complementary/alternative therapies, to include homeopathy, acupuncture, massage<BR/>7) Supplements, to include general supplements, essential fatty acids and other mineral and vitamin based preparations</P>
<P>
<B>Combination therapy</B>
<BR/>For the purposes of the updated review, CBT in combination with other interventions was investigated, with therapies combined with CBT categorised as immunological, pharmacological, complementary/alternative and supplements. Exercise in the form of graded exercise or paced activity, was assumed to be an integral component of CBT.</P>
<P>
<B>Main comparisons</B>
<BR/>For the purposes of the updated review, the following main comparisons were planned:<BR/>1. CBT versus usual care (to include treatment as usual and waiting list)<BR/>2. CBT versus immunological therapies<BR/>3. CBT versus pharmacological therapies<BR/>4. CBT versus other psychological therapies<BR/>5. CBT versus exercise<BR/>6. CBT versus complementary/alternative therapies<BR/>7. CBT versus nutritional supplements<BR/>8. CBT + other interventions (see control condition categories) versus usual care<BR/>9. CBT + other interventions versus CBT alone<BR/>10. CBT + other interventions versus other interventions alone<BR/>

<DATA_EXTRACTION MODIFIED="2009-02-13 18:07:02 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Full data extraction, using a standardised data extraction sheet, was performed by two review authors independently (EM and ET) on studies selected for inclusion in the review. Information was collected regarding the characteristics of participants, characteristics of interventions (including 'type' of CBT), characteristics of outcome measures, and results. Data on the number with each outcome event was sought by allocated treatment group, irrespective of compliance and whether or not the patient was deemed ineligible or otherwise excluded from treatment or follow-up, in order to allow an intention-to-treat analysis. If any of this information was not available in the published trial, it was sought by correspondence with the trial authors.</P>

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2009-02-13 18:06:40 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Methodological quality in the context of a systematic review of treatment trials means the extent to which design is likely to have reduced the impact of bias on the results. For the purposes of the updated version of the review, methodological quality was assessed using the Cochrane Collaboration tool for assessing risk of bias. The following domains of risk of bias were used:<BR/>1) Sequence generation: Was the allocation sequence adequately generated?<BR/>2) Allocation concealment: Was allocation adequately concealed?<BR/>3) Blinding of participants, personnel and outcome assessors for each main outcome or class of outcomes: Was knowledge of the allocated intervention adequately prevented during the study?<BR/>4) Incomplete outcome data for each main outcome or class of outcomes: Were incomplete outcome data adequately addressed?<BR/>5) Selective outcome reporting: Are reports of the study free of suggestion of selective outcome reporting?<BR/>6) Other sources of bias: Was the study apparently free of other problems that could put it at a high risk of bias?</P>
<P>Trials were allocated to three categories within and across studies as follows:<BR/>1. Low risk of bias<BR/>2. Unclear risk of bias<BR/>3. High risk of bias.</P>
<P>During this procedure, review authors (EM and VH) worked independently of each other. The review authors were not blinded to the names of the authors, institutions, journal of publication and results of the trials. The review authors compared their results, and any disagreements were resolved by discussion. In the event of disagreement, a third review author (JP) was consulted, the decisions documented, and where necessary, the authors of the studies were contacted for further information.</P>

<EFFECT_MEASURES MODIFIED="2009-02-13 18:07:21 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Continuous outcomes: where studies used the same outcome measure for a comparison, data were pooled by calculating the weighted mean difference (WMD). Where different measures were used to assess the same outcome for a comparison, data were pooled by calculating the standardised mean difference (SMD), using 95% confidence intervals.</P>
<P>Dichotomous outcomes: dichotomous outcomes were analysed by calculating an odds ratio (OR) for each comparison, with the uncertainty in each result expressed using 95% confidence intervals (CIs). For studies where the number of participants showing clinical response were not presented in the original articles, but means and standard deviations were reported for continuous symptomatology scales, the number of responders was calculated and imputed from continuous data using a validated statistical method (<LINK REF="REF-Furukawa-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Furukawa 2005</LINK>). When overall results were significant, the number needed to treat (NNT) to produce one outcome was calculated by combining the overall relative risk with an estimate of the prevalence of the event in the control group of the trials.</P>

<UNIT_OF_ANALYSIS MODIFIED="2009-02-13 18:07:39 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Where studies had two or more active treatment arms to be compared against TAU, data were managed as follows:<BR/>Continuous data - means, SDs and number of participants for each active treatment group were pooled across treatment arms as a function of the number of participants in each arm (<LINK REF="REF-Law-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Law 2003</LINK>) to be compared against the control group. As an alternative strategy, the active comparison considered to be of greatest relevance was selected (e.g. CBT was selected in preference to CT or BT arms).<BR/>Dichotomous data - active treatment groups were collapsed into a single arm for comparison against the control group, or the control group was split equally into two.</P>
</UNIT_OF_ANALYSIS>
<MISSING_DATA MODIFIED="2009-02-13 18:07:51 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Missing dichotomous data were managed through intention to treat (ITT) analysis, in which it was assumed that patients who dropped out after randomisation had a negative outcome. Best/worse case scenarios were also calculated for the clinical response outcome, in which it was assumed that dropouts in the active treatment group had positive outcomes and those in the control group had negative outcomes (best case scenario), and that dropouts in the active treatment group had negative outcomes and those in the control group had positive outcomes (worst case scenario), thus providing boundaries for the observed treatment effect.</P>
<P>Missing continuous data were either analysed on an endpoint basis, including only participants with a final assessment, or analysed using last observation carried forward to the final assessment (LOCF) if LOCF data were reported by the trial authors. Where SDs were missing, attempts were made to obtain these data through contacting trial authors. Where SDs were not available from trial authors, they were calculated from t-values, confidence intervals or standard errors, where reported in articles (<LINK REF="REF-Deeks-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deeks 1997</LINK>). If these additional figures were not available or obtainable, the study data were not included in the comparison of interest.</P>

<P>
<B>Design</B>
<BR/>All the studies were of a randomised trial design, with randomisation at the patient level for 14 trials. One trial (<LINK REF="STD-Whitehead-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Whitehead 2002</LINK>) randomised general practices to intervention or control groups.</P>
<P>The overall duration of trials including follow-up ranged from 6 weeks (<LINK REF="STD-Strang-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Strang 2002</LINK>) to 14 months (<LINK REF="STD-Prins-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Prins 2001</LINK>), with a mean duration of 7.5 months. Four studies (<LINK REF="STD-Barrett-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Barrett 1992</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Russell-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Russell 2001</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Strang-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Strang 2002</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Surawy-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Surawy 2005</LINK>) measured final outcomes immediately after the termination of intervention (no follow-up). The longest period of follow-up after intervention was 8 months (<LINK REF="STD-Huibers-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Huibers 2004</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Dowd-2000" TYPE="STUDY">O'Dowd 2000</LINK>). The overall mean duration of follow-up after intervention of 3.8 months for the 11 studies for which it could be calculated.</P>
<P>Seven studies reported obtaining ethical approval, and nine studies stated that patient consent had been obtained. Two studies made no mention of ethical approval or patient consent (<LINK REF="STD-King-1999" TYPE="STUDY">King 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Russell-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Russell 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<B>Sample sizes</B>
<BR/>The mean sample size of studies was 91 subjects, ranging from 18 subjects in a randomised trial component of a larger series of exploratory studies (<LINK REF="STD-Surawy-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Surawy 2005</LINK>), to 278 subjects in a trial conducted at three centres (<LINK REF="STD-Prins-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Prins 2001</LINK>). Nine studies reported using power calculation to estimate the required sample size prior to subject recruitment.</P>
<P>
<B>Comparison groups</B>
<BR/>Studies used between two and four arms to conduct comparisons between groups. Not all arms of all studies were used in this review. <LINK REF="STD-Lloyd-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Lloyd 1993</LINK> used a four arm trial combining psychological therapy with active or placebo immunologic therapy; only the two placebo arms were used in this review. <LINK REF="STD-Ridsdale-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Ridsdale 2004</LINK> used three arms comprising CBT, graded exercise therapy (GET), and a 'booklet and usual care' (BUC) group. This last group was described as a prospective cohort (not being randomised at the same time as the other groups), and was not used for comparison in this review.</P>
<P>
<B>Setting</B>
<BR/>Eight studies were conducted in the UK, three in the USA, two in The Netherlands, and two in Australia.</P>
<P>Four studies were conducted in a primary care setting (general practice surgeries) (<LINK REF="STD-Huibers-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Huibers 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ridsdale-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Ridsdale 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-King-1999" TYPE="STUDY">King 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Whitehead-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Whitehead 2002</LINK>), and eight in secondary care (hospital outpatients or psychology department clinics). The setting of the remaining three studies was unclear. Two studies by doctoral researchers (<LINK REF="STD-Stevens-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Stevens 1999</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Strang-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Strang 2002</LINK>) recruited subjects from sources such as physicians, psychiatrists, advertisements and local CFS support groups, but did not specify the setting in which intervention occurred. The remaining study (<LINK REF="STD-Surawy-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Surawy 2005</LINK>) did not specify sources of subject recruitment or the setting of intervention.</P>
<P>
<B>Participants</B>
<BR/>The combined sample size across the 15 included studies was 1374 participants, of which 1043 participants met the inclusion criteria for this review. In three studies, participants with a diagnosis of CFS rather than chronic fatigue symptoms were selected for inclusion (<LINK REF="STD-Huibers-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Huibers 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-King-1999" TYPE="STUDY">King 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ridsdale-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Ridsdale 2004</LINK>). One study included additional treatment arms that were not eligible for the purposes of this review (<LINK REF="STD-Lloyd-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Lloyd 1993</LINK>).<BR/>
<BR/>Ten studies gave reasons why not all patients eligible for inclusion were recruited to the study, of which seven studies reported the total number of patients eligible for inclusion. Only five studies reported the total number of patients assessed for eligibility.</P>
<P>Eleven studies provided extensive demographic information on their samples such as marital and occupational status, as well as age and gender. The remaining four studies (<LINK REF="STD-Lloyd-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Lloyd 1993</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Russell-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Russell 2001</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Whitehead-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Whitehead 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Surawy-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Surawy 2005</LINK>) provided only minimal demographic information comprising gender, mean age, or age range.</P>
<P>
<B>
<I>Age of participants</I>
</B>
<BR/>Of the ten studies which stated age criteria for subject recruitment (or the age range of their eventual sample), four studies included participants under the age of 18 years, as well as adult participants. The lower age range of these studies was 17 years for one study (<LINK REF="STD-Lloyd-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Lloyd 1993</LINK>), 16 years for two studies (<LINK REF="STD-King-1999" TYPE="STUDY">King 1999</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Ridsdale-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Ridsdale 2004</LINK>), and 15 years for one study (<LINK REF="STD-Whitehead-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Whitehead 2002</LINK>). The oldest upper age range was 75 years (<LINK REF="STD-King-1999" TYPE="STUDY">King 1999</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Ridsdale-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Ridsdale 2004</LINK>). Six studies provided the mean age of their sample, and a further eight studies provided the mean ages of comparison groups from which the weighted overall mean age could be calculated. The overall mean age of subjects was 40.9 years in these 14 studies. One study (<LINK REF="STD-Surawy-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Surawy 2005</LINK>) did not provide a mean age of the sample or comparison groups.</P>
<P>
<B>
<I>Gender composition of participants</I>
</B>
<BR/>All studies reported the gender composition of their samples. 70.1% of subjects were female.</P>
<P>
<B>
<I>Duration of illness</I>
</B>
<BR/>Three studies provided the mean duration of illness of their sample, and a further nine studies provided the mean illness duration of comparison groups from which the weighted overall mean illness duration could be calculated. The mean duration of illness in these subjects was 56.5 months (4.7 years).</P>
<P>
<B>Inclusion criteria</B>
<BR/>All studies specified inclusion criteria requiring that participants had fatigue as their main or major complaint, the minimum duration of fatigue being six months in 12 studies, at least four months in one study (<LINK REF="STD-Huibers-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Huibers 2004</LINK>), and at least three months in the two remaining studies (<LINK REF="STD-King-1999" TYPE="STUDY">King 1999</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Ridsdale-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Ridsdale 2004</LINK>). There was heterogeneity of other recruitment criteria between studies. Seven studies used the 'CDC' ('Fukuda') criteria (<LINK REF="REF-Fukuda-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fukuda 1994</LINK>) for inclusion. One of these studies (<LINK REF="STD-Prins-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Prins 2001</LINK>), waived the requirement of four of eight additional symptoms included in the CDC criteria to be present. Three studies (Sharpe 1996, <LINK REF="STD-Deale-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Deale 1996</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Surawy-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Surawy 2005</LINK>) used the 'Oxford' criteria (<LINK REF="REF-Sharpe-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sharpe 1991</LINK>) for participant inclusion. The sample in <LINK REF="STD-Deale-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Deale 1996</LINK> fulfilled CDC as well as Oxford criteria. Two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Barrett-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Barrett 1992</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Lloyd-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Lloyd 1993</LINK>) used the 'Australian' criteria (<LINK REF="REF-Lloyd-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lloyd 1988</LINK>).</P>
<P>Three studies did not use standard CFS criteria. Two of these studies (<LINK REF="STD-King-1999" TYPE="STUDY">King 1999</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Ridsdale-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Ridsdale 2004</LINK>) used a score of at least 4 on the Chalder fatigue scale (<LINK REF="REF-Chalder-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chalder 1993</LINK>) as the basis for inclusion. The remaining study (<LINK REF="STD-Huibers-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Huibers 2004</LINK>) included subjects who scored 35 or more on the Dutch Checklist Individual Strength; <LINK REF="REF-Vercoulen-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vercoulen 1999</LINK>) and who had been completely absent from work for 6-26 weeks on health grounds. These studies thus had samples suffering from chronic fatigue, of which a sub-sample met CDC chronic fatigue syndrome criteria (28% in <LINK REF="STD-King-1999" TYPE="STUDY">King 1999</LINK>, 21% in <LINK REF="STD-Ridsdale-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Ridsdale 2004</LINK>, and 44% in <LINK REF="STD-Huibers-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Huibers 2004</LINK>). Only these subgroups were used in the current review.</P>
<P>
<B>Exclusion criteria</B>
<BR/>Twelve studies specified exclusionary criteria, and two (<LINK REF="STD-Strang-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Strang 2002</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Whitehead-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Whitehead 2002</LINK>) did not. The remaining study (<LINK REF="STD-Russell-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Russell 2001</LINK>) did not stipulate any specific exclusion criteria, but did describe an assessment process for "readiness to engage in the rehabilitation process, group suitability, and the presence of other complicating psychological difficulties". It is not, however, clear whether this process resulted in exclusion of subjects. Eight studies excluded subjects with current mental disorder such as depression or bipolar disorder (n=3), psychosis (n=6), somatisation disorder (n=1), substance use (n=2), or who "were at significant risk of suicide or required urgent psychiatric treatment" (n=1). Two studies excluded those on psychiatric medication e.g. antidepressants, unless the dose was stable. Six studies excluded subjects whose symptoms were attributable to a comorbid condition or a diagnosis other than CFS. Other conditions excluding participation included pregnancy (n=2), learning difficulties precluding completion of questionnaires (n=1), organic brain syndromes (n=1), severe obesity (n=1), and asthma or ischaemic heart disease contraindicating a step-test (n=1).</P>
<P>Other exclusionary criteria were: likely inability to attend all sessions e.g. non ambulatory subjects (n=9), insufficient English language to allow participation (n=4), ongoing physical investigations (n=2), fertility treatment (n=1), previous immunologic therapy (n=1), involvement in other previous or current CFS research (n=1).</P>
<P>
<B>Assessment of participants for recruitment</B>
<BR/>In eleven studies, inclusion or exclusion criteria were applied by interviewing the subject to obtain a problem history. Some of these studies also made use of further measures such as structured or semi-structured psychiatric interviews e.g. SCID (n=5), questionnaires or rating scales (n=7), physical examination of the patient (n=4), and laboratory investigations such as full blood count, biochemistry, autoantibody screening, thyroid function tests, and screening for infectious disease (n=6).</P>
<P>Two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Stevens-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Stevens 1999</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Strang-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Strang 2002</LINK>) used a validated questionnaire as the sole method of determining recruitment eligibility, and two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Whitehead-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Whitehead 2002</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Ridsdale-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Ridsdale 2004</LINK>) recruited subjects by referral from general practitioners who had themselves made a diagnosis of CFS using respective study criteria.</P>
<P>
<B>Interventions</B>
<BR/>
<B>
<I>Comparison groups</I>
</B>
<BR/>Ten studies compared a CBT model of therapy against a wait list (WL) (n=5) or 'treatment as usual' (TUC) control condition (n=6). Three of these studies (<LINK REF="STD-Barrett-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Barrett 1992</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Prins-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Prins 2001</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Dowd-2000" TYPE="STUDY">O'Dowd 2000</LINK>) had additional comparison arms consisting of guided support/education to control for non-specific effects of therapy. A further study (<LINK REF="STD-Lloyd-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Lloyd 1993</LINK>) similarly compared CBT versus a TUC group, but both groups also attended clinic biweekly to receive intramuscular injections of saline as placebo for dialyzable lymphocyte extract (DLE). One study (<LINK REF="STD-Jason-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Jason 2007</LINK>) compared CBT with three comparison groups comprising cognitive therapy, anaerobic activity therapy, and relaxation therapy. The remaining studies compared CBT with comparison groups comprising relaxation therapy (<LINK REF="STD-Deale-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Deale 1996</LINK>), psychodynamic counselling (<LINK REF="STD-King-1999" TYPE="STUDY">King 1999</LINK>) and graded exercise therapy (<LINK REF="STD-Ridsdale-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Ridsdale 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<B>
<I>Manualisation</I>
</B>
<BR/>Seven studies reported using manuals or treatment protocols for the CBT intervention (<LINK REF="STD-Deale-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Deale 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Huibers-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Huibers 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jason-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Jason 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-King-1999" TYPE="STUDY">King 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ridsdale-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Ridsdale 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Strang-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Strang 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Prins-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Prins 2001</LINK>). Three studies reported testing of fidelity to manuals through audio or videotaping a random selection of CBT sessions (<LINK REF="STD-Jason-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Jason 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-King-1999" TYPE="STUDY">King 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Prins-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Prins 2001</LINK>) and two studies measured fidelity to manuals through research team meetings (<LINK REF="STD-Deale-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Deale 1996</LINK>) or through supervision/checking written records (<LINK REF="STD-Huibers-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Huibers 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<B>
<I>Model of CBT</I>
</B>
<BR/>Twelve studies used a 'traditional' model of CBT. Three studies deviated from traditional models of CBT (in terms of underlying theory as opposed to delivery). One of these studies (<LINK REF="STD-Stevens-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Stevens 1999</LINK>) used a chronobiologically-oriented treatment protocol (<LINK REF="REF-Nixon-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nixon 1995</LINK>), focusing on "sleep-hygiene education, biofeedback-assisted relaxation training, breathing re-training, and cognitive therapy" (<LINK REF="STD-Stevens-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Stevens 1999</LINK>). Another study (<LINK REF="STD-Strang-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Strang 2002</LINK>) used an element of personal mastery training (<LINK REF="REF-Reich-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reich 1981</LINK>) alongside traditional CBT, and one study (<LINK REF="STD-Surawy-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Surawy 2005</LINK>) used mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR; <LINK REF="REF-Kabat_x002d_Zinn-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kabat-Zinn 1991</LINK>) and mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Segal-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Segal 2002</LINK>) as the basis of its treatment model.</P>
<P>Ten studies (<LINK REF="STD-Barrett-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Barrett 1992</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Lloyd-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Lloyd 1993</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Sharpe-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Sharpe 1993</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Deale-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Deale 1996</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Stevens-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Stevens 1999</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Prins-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Prins 2001</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Strang-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Strang 2002</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Whitehead-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Whitehead 2002</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Dowd-2000" TYPE="STUDY">O'Dowd 2000</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Jason-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Jason 2007</LINK>) attempted to increase activity and reduce rest time as part of the CBT intervention. Other studies either attempted to tailor the patients' rest and activity towards levels compatible with limitations imposed by fatigue, or made no mention of activity/exercise in their intervention.</P>
<P>
<B>
<I>Delivery of intervention</I>
</B>
<BR/>Ten studies delivered therapy on a one-to-one therapist to participant basis, including one study (<LINK REF="STD-Lloyd-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Lloyd 1993</LINK>) that invited subjects to bring a close family member with them, and a further study (<LINK REF="STD-Whitehead-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Whitehead 2002</LINK>) that used a booklet and diary keeping in addition to one-to-one GP contact. Five studies used a group therapy format, with group sizes of 8 or fewer subjects (<LINK REF="STD-Russell-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Russell 2001</LINK>), 8-10 subjects (<LINK REF="STD-Strang-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Strang 2002</LINK>), 8-12 subjects (<LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Dowd-2000" TYPE="STUDY">O'Dowd 2000</LINK>) or of unspecified size (<LINK REF="STD-Barrett-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Barrett 1992</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Surawy-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Surawy 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<B>
<I>Therapist characteristics</I>
</B>
<BR/>In six studies, therapists conducting CBT were clinical psychologists, psychiatrists, and/or trained cognitive (-behavioural) therapists. One study (<LINK REF="STD-Barrett-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Barrett 1992</LINK>) used a doctoral level psychologist as therapist, after an initial session with a psychiatrist. Two other studies (<LINK REF="STD-Stevens-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Stevens 1999</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Strang-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Strang 2002</LINK>) also used doctoral level psychologists or their trained assistants to delivery therapy. Two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Whitehead-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Whitehead 2002</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Huibers-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Huibers 2004</LINK>) used GPs to deliver therapy. One study (<LINK REF="STD-Jason-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Jason 2007</LINK>) used trained nurses with experience of delivering psychotherapy. Three studies did not specify the nature and training of therapists.</P>
<P>
<B>
<I>Supervision and protocol fidelity checks</I>
</B>
<BR/>Six studies (<LINK REF="STD-Deale-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Deale 1996</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Prins-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Prins 2001</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-King-1999" TYPE="STUDY">King 1999</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Huibers-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Huibers 2004</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Ridsdale-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Ridsdale 2004</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Jason-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Jason 2007</LINK>) specified that the therapists were supervised, and a further study (<LINK REF="STD-Whitehead-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Whitehead 2002</LINK>) offered telephone support to GP therapists, but this did not amount to formal supervision. Four studies (<LINK REF="STD-Prins-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Prins 2001</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-King-1999" TYPE="STUDY">King 1999</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Huibers-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Huibers 2004</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Jason-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Jason 2007</LINK>) assessed treatment fidelity (e.g. through blind assessment of video-taped sessions by experienced therapists), and a further study (<LINK REF="STD-Deale-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Deale 1996</LINK>) stated that regular meetings were held to ensure sessions adhered to the treatment protocol.</P>
<P>
<B>
<I>Total, frequency and length of intervention sessions</I>
</B>
<BR/>The frequency of sessions ranged from weekly in five studies (<LINK REF="STD-Barrett-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Barrett 1992</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Sharpe-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Sharpe 1993</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Deale-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Deale 1996</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Stevens-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Stevens 1999</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Surawy-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Surawy 2005</LINK>), once every two weeks (<LINK REF="STD-Lloyd-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Lloyd 1993</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Prins-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Prins 2001</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Ridsdale-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Ridsdale 2004</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Dowd-2000" TYPE="STUDY">O'Dowd 2000</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Jason-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Jason 2007</LINK>), or with a variable gap between sessions not exceeding three weeks (<LINK REF="STD-Deale-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Deale 1996</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Strang-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Strang 2002</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Whitehead-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Whitehead 2002</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Huibers-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Huibers 2004</LINK>). One study (<LINK REF="STD-King-1999" TYPE="STUDY">King 1999</LINK>) did not specify the frequency of sessions.</P>
<P>The minimum number of sessions specified was five to seven (<LINK REF="STD-Huibers-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Huibers 2004</LINK>), and the maximum was sixteen (<LINK REF="STD-Sharpe-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Sharpe 1993</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Prins-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Prins 2001</LINK>), though in one study (<LINK REF="STD-Whitehead-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Whitehead 2002</LINK>) participants were asked to visit their GPs for therapy weekly or once every two weeks over 12 months.</P>
<P>Session length ranged from a minimum of 30 minutes (<LINK REF="STD-Huibers-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Huibers 2004</LINK>) to a maximum of 150 minutes in a group format including a 30 minute break (<LINK REF="STD-Russell-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Russell 2001</LINK>). The modal length of session was 60 minutes. One study did not specify the length of treatment sessions (<LINK REF="STD-Surawy-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Surawy 2005</LINK>), and in a further study (<LINK REF="STD-Whitehead-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Whitehead 2002</LINK>) session length was set by the treating GPs.</P>
<P>For the eleven studies in which total protocol treatment time could be determined, the minimum time was 4 hours (<LINK REF="STD-Ridsdale-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Ridsdale 2004</LINK>), and the maximum time 30 hours (including breaks) (<LINK REF="STD-Russell-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Russell 2001</LINK>). The mean total treatment specified in these studies' protocols was approximately 13 hours. In the five studies (<LINK REF="STD-Prins-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Prins 2001</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-King-1999" TYPE="STUDY">King 1999</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Huibers-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Huibers 2004</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Ridsdale-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Ridsdale 2004</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Jason-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Jason 2007</LINK>) reporting actual treatment adherence across conditions, the mean time spent in CBT or control treatment was approximately eight hours.</P>

<I>Non-intervention elements of care programmes</I>
</B>
<BR/>Of the five studies (<LINK REF="STD-Deale-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Deale 1996</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Stevens-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Stevens 1999</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Prins-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Prins 2001</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Huibers-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Huibers 2004</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Dowd-2000" TYPE="STUDY">O'Dowd 2000</LINK>) reporting whether non-intervention aspects of treatment protocols were similar, only one (<LINK REF="STD-Prins-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Prins 2001</LINK>) noted differences (forbidding participants in the CBT condition to have physical investigations related to chronic fatigue syndrome during the intervention, but allowing participants in the 'guided support' and 'natural course' conditions to do so). Five studies explicitly stated that psychiatric medication e.g. antidepressants and anxiolytic drugs, was not forbidden by protocol. A further study (<LINK REF="STD-Prins-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Prins 2001</LINK>) noted that other treatments for CFS were forbidden by trial protocol (but made no mention of psychiatric medication). One study (<LINK REF="STD-Sharpe-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Sharpe 1993</LINK>) noted that two participants (7%) in its TUC condition received supportive psychotherapy, and that one participant (3%) in the CBT condition received counselling as part of vocational training. A further study (<LINK REF="STD-Huibers-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Huibers 2004</LINK>) noted that 18% of CBT and 31% of TUC participants received "psychosocial co-interventions" during the intervention period.</P>
<P>
<B>Outcomes</B>
<BR/>A wide range of outcomes were used in the included studies. These include measures of this review's primary outcome (fatigue), as well as secondary outcomes such as physical functioning, depression, anxiety, acceptability of treatment, quality of life, occupational outcome, treatment compliance, dropout rate, health service resource use, illness attribution, and adverse effects. A range of rating methods were used including self-report questionnaires (e.g. Chalder fatigue scale; <LINK REF="REF-Chalder-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chalder 1993</LINK>), observer-rated outcomes (e.g. Karnofsky performance status scale; <LINK REF="REF-Karnofsky-1948" TYPE="REFERENCE">Karnofsky 1948</LINK>) and physiological measures (e.g. step test, white cell count).</P>
<P>The most common measure of fatigue was the Chalder fatigue scale, followed by the Profile of Mood States (POMS) fatigue scale (<LINK REF="REF-McNair-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">McNair 1992</LINK>). The most common measures of physical functioning were the Karnofsky scale and physical functioning subscale of the Medical Outcomes Survey (MOS) SF-36 scale (<LINK REF="REF-Ware-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ware 1993</LINK>). Commonly used measures of depression included the Beck Depression Inventory (<LINK REF="REF-Beck-1961" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beck 1961</LINK>), and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS; <LINK REF="REF-Zigmond-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zigmond 1983</LINK>), the latter also being the most common measure of anxiety along with the Beck Anxiety Inventory (Beck 1990). Quality of life was most often measured by the SF-36 in its entirety (including physical and mental functioning subscales). Other outcomes had more heterogeneous measures.</P>
<P>Six studies (<LINK REF="STD-Sharpe-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Sharpe 1993</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Deale-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Deale 1996</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Prins-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Prins 2001</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Huibers-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Huibers 2004</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Ridsdale-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Ridsdale 2004</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Dowd-2000" TYPE="STUDY">O'Dowd 2000</LINK>) used pre-determined criteria for successful outcomes on major measures which were deemed to represent clinical improvement. These outcomes were either of physical functioning (n=4) and/or fatigue (n=2).</P>
<P>Eight studies detailed dropout rates during treatment. Five studies reported dropout rates across the duration of the trial including follow-up. One study (<LINK REF="STD-Whitehead-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Whitehead 2002</LINK>) presented data as to how many patients were using activity diaries at different points of follow-up. One study reported only the mean dropout rate across all conditions (<LINK REF="STD-Jason-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Jason 2007</LINK>).</P>

<B>Ongoing studies</B>
<BR/>Searches of CCDANCTR-Studies and CCDANCTR-Refs identified a total of six ongoing studies (<LINK REF="STD-Wearden-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Wearden 2006</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-White-2005" TYPE="STUDY">White 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bleijenberg-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Bleijenberg 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Carney-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Carney 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gibson_x002d_Saxty-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Gibson-Saxty 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vissers-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Vissers 2008</LINK>) that appear to meet the inclusion criteria for this review. No findings have yet been reported or obtained from these studies.</P>
<P>
<B>Studies awaiting assessment</B>
<BR/>Two studies were identified which may fulfil review criteria but could not be included in the present review. The first study (<LINK REF="STD-Chalder-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Chalder 1997</LINK>) randomised participants to either a self-help booklet with specific advice (incorporating cognitive behavioural elements), or a no treatment control group. Participants were primary care patients complaining of fatigue who had previously presented with a possible viral illness. Inclusion criteria were deliberately broad, but included a subgroup of participants who met 'Oxford' criteria for CFS (12% of sample). However, the review authors have as yet been unable to obtain this subgroup data for inclusion in the review.</P>
<P>The second study (<LINK REF="STD-Powell-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Powell 2001</LINK>), compared "evidence based-explanation of symptoms that encouraged graded activity" against standardised medical care. Delivery of intervention was in three groups (minimum, telephone, and maximum intervention groups) with varying amounts of face-to-face contact. Whilst each intervention included some cognitive-behavioural principles, the review authors have been unable to establish with the study authors which, if any, of these interventions might satisfy inclusion criteria for this review.</P>

</STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<STUDY_QUALITY MODIFIED="2009-02-13 18:18:51 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The methodological quality of the 15 studies included in the review was classified according to the Cochrane Collaboration's tool for assessing the risk of bias. The risk of bias in each of the six domains of validity (sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding of participants/personnel/outcome assessors, incomplete outcome data, selective outcome reporting, and other sources of bias) was rated independently by two review authors as 'high', 'low' or 'unclear', and differences between authors were reconciled. The final ratings are reported in the Characteristics of Included Studies table. A risk of bias summary graph (<LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>) and summary figure (<LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>) are also presented.</P>

<P>
<B>Sequence generation</B>
<BR/>Whilst all studies specified that participants were randomly allocated to conditions (or GP practices randomised to treatment or control conditions in the case of <LINK REF="STD-Whitehead-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Whitehead 2002</LINK>), only seven studies specified the method of generating the sequence leading to random allocation, whether by computer (n=3) or random number table (n=4). No study specified a sequence generation method that was quasi- or non-random, therefore these seven studies received a 'low' risk of bias rating for sequence generation, with the remaining eight studies receiving a rating of 'uncertain'.</P>
<P>Eight studies reported using blocked randomisation, and four studies stratified their samples, by presence of major depressive disorder (<LINK REF="STD-Sharpe-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Sharpe 1993</LINK>), by source of referral (<LINK REF="STD-Deale-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Deale 1996</LINK>), by length of work absence (<LINK REF="STD-Huibers-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Huibers 2004</LINK>), or by duration and severity of fatigue (<LINK REF="STD-Ridsdale-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Ridsdale 2004</LINK>).<BR/>
<BR/>
<B>Allocation concealment</B>
<BR/>Method of concealing assignment to condition from investigators and participants was described by seven studies through the use of numbered/opaque envelopes (variously described as being opened in front of the participant, immediately before his/her first session, or being handled by third parties).</P>
<P>Nine studies conducted preliminary univariate analyses of demographic and historical characteristics to check that randomisation had resulted in appropriate comparability of groups for demographic characteristics, with six reporting differences between groups. <LINK REF="STD-Sharpe-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Sharpe 1993</LINK> reported that significantly fewer CBT participants were actively employed, and spent significantly more days in bed than TUC subjects. <LINK REF="STD-Deale-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Deale 1996</LINK> reported that CBT participants were on average seven years older than the relaxation group. A greater number of the CBT group in <LINK REF="STD-Strang-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Strang 2002</LINK> received disability compensation than the wait list group, while the CBT patients in <LINK REF="STD-Whitehead-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Whitehead 2002</LINK> were younger and had a shorter duration of illness than their TUC counterparts. CBT subjects in <LINK REF="STD-Ridsdale-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Ridsdale 2004</LINK> had a longer median duration of fatigue than GET participants.

<P>One trial (<LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Dowd-2000" TYPE="STUDY">O'Dowd 2000</LINK>) stated that "both the participants and those administering the assessments were unaware of which cohort the subject was in", and indeed described its protocol as a "double-blind randomised controlled trial". The only formal test of participant blinding to treatment group was in the case of active or placebo DLE injection in <LINK REF="STD-Lloyd-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Lloyd 1993</LINK> (which described itself as a 'double blind, randomised, placebo controlled study'), which showed participants estimations of whether they received active or placebo DLE bore no significant correlation with actual treatment received. Only one study (<LINK REF="STD-Huibers-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Huibers 2004</LINK>) specifically mentioned that researchers and treatment providers were not blinded to treatment allocation.</P>
<P>Of the four studies comparing CBT with other psychological/exercise therapy interventions, only two (<LINK REF="STD-King-1999" TYPE="STUDY">King 1999</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Jason-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Jason 2007</LINK>) assessed treatment fidelity. Of these, one study (<LINK REF="STD-King-1999" TYPE="STUDY">King 1999</LINK>) used four independent assessors of recorded sessions and found differentiation in the management approaches of the two groups according to specified protocol. The other (<LINK REF="STD-Jason-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Jason 2007</LINK>) used a licensed and masters level psychologist (who had acceptable inter-rater reliability) to rate a random sample of sessions according to therapists' use of techniques unique to the four treatment conditions, and indeed found the conditions were discriminant according to corresponding treatment manuals. A third study (<LINK REF="STD-Deale-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Deale 1996</LINK>) did not formally assess treatment fidelity, but did hold regular meetings to ensure protocol adherence. Two other studies (<LINK REF="STD-Prins-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Prins 2001</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Huibers-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Huibers 2004</LINK>) also assessed treatment fidelity, not to differentiate CBT from other psychological or graded exercise treatment, but to check quality of CBT intervention.</P>
<P>The outcome variables in ten studies were assessed by self-report scales or were based on physiological data (e.g. step-test, white cell count). The remaining five studies included outcome measures that were based on observer assessment. Three of these studies used the Karnofsky scale. Of these, one study (<LINK REF="STD-Prins-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Prins 2001</LINK>) used "an independent clinical psychologist" to rate Karnofsky score who by this description is presumed to have been blind. Another study (<LINK REF="STD-Sharpe-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Sharpe 1993</LINK>) reported using a blinded researcher to rate participants Karnofsky status, on the basis of an interview made with participants by another researcher; however, the blinding status of the researcher conducting the interview was not specified. The remaining study to use the Karnofsky scale (<LINK REF="STD-Lloyd-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Lloyd 1993</LINK>) made no mention of blinding of assessor.</P>
<P>Two further studies used assessors to rate the change of participants on clinical dimensions. One study (<LINK REF="STD-Jason-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Jason 2007</LINK>) included a clinician global impression of change in the patient's overall functioning. No mention of blinding to treatment group was made. One study (<LINK REF="STD-Deale-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Deale 1996</LINK>) included an assessor rating of participants' degree of fatigue and disability through a structured interview.

<B>Dropout rates</B>
<BR/>Whilst not all studies differentiated between dropouts during therapy and those lost to follow-up assessment, 14 studies reported dropout rates between baseline and end of treatment (or first post-treatment assessment) by comparison group. The remaining study (<LINK REF="STD-Jason-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Jason 2007</LINK>) reported a mean drop-out rate across all conditions.</P>
<P>Studies used varying criteria to define a dropout. For example, <LINK REF="STD-Ridsdale-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Ridsdale 2004</LINK> used a conservative estimate of failing to complete all six of the sessions of therapy specified in the study protocol, whereas <LINK REF="STD-Jason-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Jason 2007</LINK> reports a participant was deemed to have dropped out if they completed four or fewer sessions out of 13 specified. Some studies (e.g. <LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Dowd-2000" TYPE="STUDY">O'Dowd 2000</LINK>) defined dropouts not on the basis of intervention sessions attended, but instead on whether participants attended follow-up assessment or not. Another study (<LINK REF="STD-Prins-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Prins 2001</LINK>) used different criteria for dropout between groups; in the TUC group, only participants not attending assessments were classified as dropouts. In the CBT group, stopping coming to therapy was defined as a dropout, whereas in the guided support group, frequent non-attendance was not classified as a dropout (a dropout was only counted if the participant formally declared an intention to withdraw). <LINK REF="STD-Whitehead-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Whitehead 2002</LINK> reported dropouts as those unavailable for assessment at six months (31% of subjects). However, over 70% of subjects had terminated use of their treatment diaries or GP contact by that time.</P>
<P>The mean aggregate reported dropout rate of all 15 studies was 16.4%. Dropout rates ranged from 0% (<LINK REF="STD-Sharpe-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Sharpe 1993</LINK>) to 40% (<LINK REF="STD-Whitehead-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Whitehead 2002</LINK>), with six studies (<LINK REF="STD-Prins-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Prins 2001</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-King-1999" TYPE="STUDY">King 1999</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Strang-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Strang 2002</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Whitehead-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Whitehead 2002</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Ridsdale-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Ridsdale 2004</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Jason-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Jason 2007</LINK>) reporting dropout rates of over 20%. For the 14 studies reporting dropout rates by comparison group, the mean dropout rate for the CBT intervention was 16.8%. Of the four studies comparing CBT with another active psychological/graded exercise therapy, only one (<LINK REF="STD-Jason-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Jason 2007</LINK>) detailed that there were no differences between dropout rates of comparison groups (mean 25%). Dropout rates were broadly similar in the other three studies: 10% CBT vs 13.3% relaxation (<LINK REF="STD-Deale-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Deale 1996</LINK>); 36.3% CBT vs. 31.3% counselling (<LINK REF="STD-King-1999" TYPE="STUDY">King 1999</LINK>); and 28.6% versus 40% graded exercise therapy (<LINK REF="STD-Ridsdale-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Ridsdale 2004</LINK>). Dropout rates between comparison groups also appeared broadly similar in the three studies comparing CBT with a guided support/education arm: 6.7% CBT versus 0% education and support (<LINK REF="STD-Barrett-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Barrett 1992</LINK>); 36.6% CBT versus 30.9% guided support (<LINK REF="STD-Prins-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Prins 2001</LINK>); and 5.8% versus 10% education and support (<LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Dowd-2000" TYPE="STUDY">O'Dowd 2000</LINK>).</P>

<BR/>Two studies used an individual CBT modality and four studies used group CBT. A highly significant difference in effect was shown for individual therapy and a significant difference of lesser magnitude was shown for group therapy when compared with usual care.</P>
<P>
<B>b) Treatment as usual vs waiting list (Graph 05 02)</B>
<BR/>Three studies used a treatment as usual condition and three studies used a waiting list as the control condition. A highly significant difference in effect was shown for the CBT group when compared with treatment as usual. In contrast a non-significant difference in effect was shown for the CBT group when compared with the waiting list condition.</P>
<P>
<B>c) Increased activity as component of CBT (Graph 05 03)</B>
<BR/>Four studies incorporated an increased activity component into the CBT intervention and two studies tailored activity and rest to the needs of the individual or did not specify an activity schedule. A highly significant difference in effect was shown for the CBT group in which increased activity was incorporated when compared with usual care. In contrast, a non-significant difference in effect was shown for the studies in which increased activity was not part of the CBT intervention when compared with usual care.</P>
<P>
<B>d) Number of sessions (Graph 05 04)</B>
<BR/>Four studies offered eight or fewer sessions of CBT, and two studies offered more than eight sessions of CBT. A highly significant difference in effect of similar magnitude was shown for both CBT groups when compared with usual care.<BR/>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2009-02-13 18:17:05 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In the original review, no meta-analyses were performed, since only three studies were eligible for inclusion at that time, and each study used a different control intervention. This updated version of the review includes an additional 12 studies conducted since 1999. All 15 included studies provided some data for meta-analyses, and four comparisons were performed. A summary of the main findings for each comparison follows.</P>
<P>
<B>Cognitive behavioural therapy versus usual care</B>
<BR/>Based on a homogeneous group of six studies (373 participants), the review provides evidence that at post-treatment, CBT was more effective than usual care in reducing the severity of fatigue symptoms in CFS patients who had persisted with treatment. The robustness of this finding is supported by the outcome of clinical response (4 studies, 371 participants), with a 40% response rate for CBT compared to 26% for usual care. However, at short to medium term follow-up (rather than immediately post-treatment), the evidence for the effectiveness of CBT was inconclusive. Anxiety symptoms were lower at post treatment in patients who completed CBT sessions than those assigned to usual care, but not at follow-up. Patients assigned to usual care were less likely to drop out of treatment than those assigned to CBT.</P>
<P>Four sub-group analyses were conducted. The first sub-group analysis found that individual CBT interventions were highly effective in reducing fatigue severity compared with usual care at post treatment, whereas the difference between a group modality of CBT and usual care only just reached significance. The second found that CBT was highly effective in reducing fatigue severity when compared with treatment as usual control, and, in contrast, there was no significant difference between CBT and waiting list control. The third found that CBT in which increased activity and reduced rest was a component of treatment was highly effective in reducing fatigue severity compared with usual care, and, in contrast, CBT without focus on increased activity, or in which this was not specified, was no more effective than usual care. Finally, both 8 or fewer sessions of CBT and more than 8 sessions were highly effective in reducing fatigue severity compared with usual care. Given the non-randomisation of studies into subgroups coupled with the small number of studies, the significance of these findings should be interpreted with caution.</P>
<P>
<B>Cognitive behavioural therapy versus other psychological therapies</B>
<BR/>Based on a homogeneous group of four studies (309 participants) the review provides evidence that CBT was more effective than other psychological therapies in reducing the severity of fatigue symptoms in CFS patients persisting with treatment at post treatment. This finding is supported by the clinical response outcome (3 studies, 259 participants), with a 48% response rate for CBT in contrast with 28% for other psychological therapies. Patients who completed CBT sessions achieved a greater improvement in physical functioning, together with lower depression, anxiety and psychological distress symptoms at post-treatment than those who completed other psychological therapy sessions. At short term follow-up, the difference between CBT and other psychological therapies was inconsistent, and statistical heterogeneity was indicated.</P>
<P>
<B>Cognitive behavioural therapy versus exercise </B>
<BR/>The evidence is limited to two studies, both of which independently showed a lack of difference between CBT and exercise in reducing fatigue levels or increasing clinical response, at post treatment and at medium term follow-up.</P>
<P>
<B>Cognitive behavioural therapy combined with other interventions versus usual care </B>
<BR/>The evidence is limited to a single study of 27 participants, which showed that at post-treatment, CBT combined with biofeedback, relaxation and aerobic exercise was more effective in reducing fatigue severity than usual care.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2009-02-13 18:17:36 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>
<B>Participants</B>
<BR/>The majority of studies included in this review were conducted in outpatient departments or specialist clinics, and two thirds of studies excluded patients who were 'incapable' of attending sessions or confined to wheelchairs/bed. In limiting the population to those patients who were more mobile, the findings from this review may not be representative of more severely affected individuals. Nevertheless, chronicity was a key clinical feature for participants in included studies, with mean duration of illness estimated at 4.7 years.</P>
<P>The updated version of the review includes four trials in which recruitment was wholly or partially conducted in primary care settings (<LINK REF="STD-Huibers-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Huibers 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-King-1999" TYPE="STUDY">King 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ridsdale-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Ridsdale 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Whitehead-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Whitehead 2002</LINK>). This potentially increases the generalisability of the findings to individuals with less disabling and severe symptoms. However, with each of these four studies, this review restricted the analysed dataset to the subgroup of participants diagnosed with CFS. The rationale for this was the minimisation of diagnostic heterogeneity, although it is acknowledged that this may have reduced the applicability of the findings to primary care settings.</P>
<P>
<B>Interventions</B>
<BR/>The updated review shows that the largest body of evidence comprises traditional CBT interventions adapted for CFS populations, in which increasing activity and reducing rest time are core features of treatment. In line with the emergence of newer 'third wave' CBT interventions, however, a recently conducted study of mindfulness CBT has also been included in the review (<LINK REF="STD-Surawy-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Surawy 2005</LINK>). In this intervention, participants are encouraged to observe symptoms, thoughts and emotions without attempting to avoid or change them. It seems likely that further trials informed by compassion focused and mindfulness principles will be conducted and included in future updates.</P>
<P>Given the complex and often chronic clinical presentation of CFS, it seems conceivable that a combination of interventions might be required for the optimal treatment of this disorder. In updating this review, it had been hoped to include evidence from trials of combination therapies. Surprisingly, however, despite an exhaustive search of the literature, the evidence base for combination therapy appears to contain just two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Stevens-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Stevens 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lloyd-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Lloyd 1993</LINK>). This precludes the ability to draw conclusions on which interventions might be more effective in combination rather than as stand-alone treatments.</P>
<P>During this review it was also planned to conduct formal comparisons between CBT alone and other active interventions alone. However, to date, the evidence base is limited to just two studies, both of which compared CBT to a manualised exercise intervention. One additional group of studies (<LINK REF="STD-Barrett-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Barrett 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Deale-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Deale 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Dowd-2000" TYPE="STUDY">O'Dowd 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Prins-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Prins 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-King-1999" TYPE="STUDY">King 1999</LINK>) compared CBT with other psychological therapy interventions, including relaxation, education and support and counselling. However, these interventions were largely intended as attention placebo conditions, rather than as active treatments.</P>
<P>
<B>Outcomes</B>
<BR/>An encouraging feature of recent trials examining the effectiveness of CBT for CFS is the use of more extended follow-up periods. The majority of studies conducted over the last eight years incorporated follow-up time points 6-12 months post-treatment, with one study (<LINK REF="STD-Deale-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Deale 1996</LINK>) conducting a five year follow-up with 88% of the original sample, thus providing a more clinically relevant measure of effectiveness and cost-effectiveness.</P>
<P>Effective treatments are of little value to health services unless they are acceptable to the recipients - poor acceptability will reduce treatment uptake and adherence. Only three trials included in this review incorporated the outcome of satisfaction with treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Deale-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Deale 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jason-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Jason 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ridsdale-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Ridsdale 2004</LINK>), with usable data available from one study only (<LINK REF="STD-Deale-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Deale 1996</LINK>). Given the understandable ambivalence of many CFS patients towards a psychological treatment for symptoms that are experienced as physical, the under-investigation of acceptability of treatment is an important omission. Other outcomes which are of high relevance to the individual with CFS, including adverse effects, health-related quality of life, and occupational outcomes, are also under-evaluated in the included studies.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2009-02-13 18:15:44 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Historically, trials of psychological therapy have provided poor quality information on the specific randomisation procedure used to assign participants to groups. Therefore, it is encouraging that nearly half of the studies included in the updated review described and used appropriate methods of sequence generation and allocation concealment. Nevertheless, many studies failed to describe their randomisation procedure, and, therefore, it is not possible to assess the extent to which selection bias may have occurred in this group of studies.</P>
<P>Blinding of therapists and participants is not feasible in trials of psychological therapy, although it is notable that two studies in the review did make strenuous attempt to reduce or avoid contamination between groups (<LINK REF="STD-Prins-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Prins 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Dowd-2000" TYPE="STUDY">O'Dowd 2000</LINK>). Whilst the use of blinded assessors is feasible in psychological therapy trials, the majority of studies used subjective self-report measures to collect psychological outcomes. In general, little information was provided on the data collection process, and the extent to which response bias may have occurred is uncertain. Of the five studies that used clinician-rated measures, only three studies reported the use of independent or blinded assessors (<LINK REF="STD-Deale-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Deale 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Prins-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Prins 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sharpe-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Sharpe 1993</LINK>) to minimise detection bias.</P>
<P>Waiting list is frequently employed as an ethical 'no treatment' condition, to ensure that all participants eventually receive the 'active' treatment. This approach was used in almost half of all studies comparing CBT against usual care. However, sub-group analyses showed that, at post-treatment, waiting list patients had reduced fatigue symptoms equivalent to those of patients attending for treatment. A possible explanation is that being on the waiting list for treatment had a 'holding' positive influence, decreasing the apparent effect of the CBT intervention.</P>
<P>Because psychological therapy involves the application of complex techniques over a period of time, it is important from a methodological perspective that each intervention is operationally defined by detailed protocols (<LINK REF="REF-Borkovec-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Borkovec 2001</LINK>). One of the methodological weaknesses of trials included in this review was the apparent failure of eight of the fifteen studies to use manuals or treatment protocols to more effectively standardise the CBT provided. Most studies did, however, employ therapists who were experienced in the psychological model under examination. Testing of therapists' fidelity to treatment manuals through the systematic or random checking of audiotapes by independent clinicians is an additional key methodological aspect of psychological therapy studies. This ensures that any observed treatment effect can be attributed to specific components and characteristics of the model. However, only three of the fifteen included studies reported testing therapists' treatment fidelity through assessing recordings of sessions (<LINK REF="STD-Prins-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Prins 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-King-1999" TYPE="STUDY">King 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jason-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Jason 2007</LINK>). Therefore, there is no certainty in most of the studies that therapists were adhering to the required psychological model.</P>
<P>Four studies controlled for therapist attention by using low intensity interventions such as education and support or relaxation. When compared against these placebo interventions, CBT appeared to achieve a more consistently positive effect across all outcomes than when compared against usual care, a finding that appears counter-intuitive. It is possible that the findings could be explained by the greater use of naturalistic treatments in usual care conditions. However, another plausible explanation is the influence of researcher allegiance to CBT, as in three of these studies the therapist was also the primary investigator (<LINK REF="STD-Barrett-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Barrett 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Deale-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Deale 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Dowd-2000" TYPE="STUDY">O'Dowd 2000</LINK>). In addition, in the study by <LINK REF="STD-Prins-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Prins 2001</LINK>, the control condition was group therapy with less emphasis given to regular attendance, in contrast with the CBT intervention, which was individual in modality. Whilst it is possible, therefore, that the effect of CBT may have been over-estimated when compared with the low intensity conditions, it should nevertheless be acknowledged that CBT and placebo conditions appeared to be managed equally across studies in terms of manualisation, fidelity checking, and therapist qualifications/experience.</P>
<P>Whilst the overall attrition rate across studies was reasonably low at 16.4%, six of the fifteen studies had dropout rates of higher than 20%, and only five studies reported reasons for attrition in full for each group. Therefore, it is not certain to what extent there might have been systematic differences between dropouts and completers between groups that could have influenced treatment outcomes, leading to an underestimate or overestimate of effect. In contrast, however, missing data was well managed in most studies, with nine studies conducting a sensitivity analysis, analyses using intention to treat principles, or last observation carried forward.</P>

<P>
<B>Strengths<BR/>
</B>A core strength of this review is the extensive, rigorous and highly sensitive search strategy used to locate high quality evidence. As a result, randomised evidence from unpublished as well as published studies were included in the review, none of which have been included in previous high quality systematic reviews. Furthermore, vigorous efforts made to obtain missing data resulted in additional data from three investigators (<LINK REF="STD-King-1999" TYPE="STUDY">King 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Huibers-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Huibers 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Prins-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Prins 2001</LINK>), and responses from two further investigators who may be able to provide access to their datasets in future updates (<LINK REF="STD-Chalder-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Chalder 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Russell-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Russell 2001</LINK>). It seems likely that all or almost all evidence that should have been included was included and that the occurrence of publication bias may have been minimised. The increased number of studies, and their relative homogeneity, permitted a quantitative synthesis of some of the data, thus improving the precision of the estimates of the effectiveness of CBT</P>
<P>A further strength is the diversity of the authors' areas of expertise, coupled with collaborative and transparent review methods, ensuring that the potential for bias was minimised. Two independent review authors were involved in every stage of the review process and a third author mediated when necessary. During study selection, the authors' different perspectives helped to inform inclusion-exclusion decisions when, for example, it was difficult to assess the extent to which interventions were sufficiently CBT-based to be included in the review. Of note, in the case of one study where it was not possible to reach agreement on its inclusion, the authors of the study concerned (<LINK REF="STD-Powell-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Powell 2001</LINK>) were invited to cast the deciding vote.</P>
<P>
<B>Limitations<BR/>
</B>Although every effort was made to obtain missing data from trial authors, it was not possible in every case to obtain these data, and therefore the included studies are not represented fully in the meta-analyses.</P>
<P>Given that formal blinding of participants and clinicians to treatment arm is not inherently possible in trials of psychological therapy, the decision was taken to assess the risk of bias for the blinding domain on the basis of outcome assessor blinding only, whilst acknowledging that our decision to do this could have under-estimated the extent to which clinicians' and participants' knowledge of group assignation influenced the true effect.</P>
<P>Whilst the identification and inclusion of four unpublished studies (<LINK REF="STD-Barrett-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Barrett 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Russell-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Russell 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Strang-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Strang 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stevens-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Stevens 1999</LINK>) is regarded as a strength of the updated review in terms of reducing publication bias, it should nevertheless be acknowledged that these trials have not been through full peer review and may have been especially vulnerable to bias.</P>

<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2009-02-13 18:16:20 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The key high quality review of evidence in this area is that by Chambers and colleagues (<LINK REF="REF-Chambers-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chambers 2006</LINK>), which helped to inform the UK's NICE Clinical Guideline on the care of people with CFS-ME (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2007</LINK>). The <LINK REF="REF-Chambers-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chambers 2006</LINK> review addressed a very wide range of therapeutic modalities, including not only CBT and graded exercise, but also immunological, complementary, pharmacological, and nutritional therapies. Like this review, it noted a marked increase in the size and the quality of the evidence-base for interventions for CFS. It concluded that two interventions, CBT and graded exercise, appeared to be effective, but that there was either evidence of lack of effectiveness or a lack of evidence for other interventions. However, the conclusions drawn by <LINK REF="REF-Chambers-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chambers 2006</LINK> for CBT interventions were based on a smaller dataset than that provided in this review, included non-randomised controlled trials, and no meta-analyses were undertaken. A recently published systematic review and meta-analysis by <LINK REF="REF-Malouff-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Malouff 2008</LINK>, using broader inclusion criteria, and based on the calculation of a pooled effect size rather than head to head comparisons, has drawn similiar conclusions to those of <LINK REF="REF-Chambers-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chambers 2006</LINK>.The updated findings from the current review provide robust high quality evidence to support those reported by <LINK REF="REF-Chambers-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chambers 2006</LINK> and <LINK REF="REF-Malouff-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Malouff 2008</LINK> for the effectiveness of CBT interventions for CFS, and in addition, is able to demonstrate the homogeneity of the evidence.</P>

</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>CBT is more effective than usual care for reducing fatigue symptoms in adults with CFS, with 40% of participants assigned to CBT showing clinical response at post-treatment, in comparison with 26% assigned to usual care control. The benefits of CBT in sustaining clinical response and reduction of fatigue symptoms at short and medium term follow-up are inconclusive. The benefits of CBT in improving physical functioning and reducing depression, anxiety and psychological distress at post treatment and at follow-up are also uncertain. </P>
<P>CBT may be more effective in reducing fatigue symptoms at post treatment than psychological therapies using relaxation techniques or a support and education approach, and may also be more effective in improving physical functioning and reducing depression, anxiety and psychological distress at post-treatment. However these findings are based on a small body of evidence in which other therapies were designed as attention placebo controls, which limits confidence in the findings obtained. The body of evidence for CBT compared with relaxation or support and education at short and medium term follow-up is very small, heterogeneous and inconclusive.</P>
<P>CBT may be an acceptable form of treatment for CFS, although this evidence is currently based on a small number of individual studies. Whilst the overall attrition rate from CBT interventions is reasonably low, at 16%, reasons for dropout were under-reported in studies, and may not only have been due to low acceptability or ineffectiveness of CBT. </P>
<P>Currently there is a lack of available evidence on the effectiveness of CBT as a stand-alone intervention or in combination with other interventions compared with usual care or other types of treatment (including immunological therapies, pharmacological therapies, exercise, complementary/alternative therapies and nutritional supplements) for CFS. </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>The body of evidence for the effectiveness of CBT for CFS has grown considerably in quantity and methodological quality over the past eight years. The studies included in this review demonstrated some methodological strengths, including the increasing use of appropriate randomisation procedures, attempts to control for therapist attention and time, and follow-up assessments conducted 6-12 months after the completion of treatment. Further specific recommendations to enhance the internal validity of future studies include the recruitment of larger appropriately powered samples, the use of treatment as usual control conditions rather than waiting list, systematic assessment of psychological therapy fidelity to manuals/protocols, and further use of blinded outcome assessors. To increase the applicability of the findings to CFS individuals, clinicians and policy makers, future studies should include adverse effects, acceptablity and quality of life measures, together with cost-effectiveness, health service resource use and occupational outcomes. </P>
<P>Whilst the evidence base for CBT as a stand-alone treatment for CFS continues to expand, there is a surprising lack of high quality evidence on the effectiveness of CBT alone or in combination with other treatments to inform the development of clinical management programmes for people with CFS. Given the complex and chronic clinical presentation of CFS, coupled with the evidence that CBT alone is effective for no more than 40-48% of patients at the end of treatment, trials examining CBT in combination with other interventions to increase treatment effectiveness should be prioritised. </P>
<P>To date trials have been largely conducted in secondary or primary care settings, recruiting patients who are sufficiently mobile to attend out-patient clinics for CBT sessions. Studies based in domicilary or in-patient settings should be considered in order to establish the extent to which CBT is effective for those who are severely disabled with CFS. </P>
<P>Whilst the review provides some very preliminary findings for the effectiveness of CBT using an individual modality and using increased activity, further study of these aspects of the CBT interventions are required in order to be able to draw valid conclusions on their superior benefit. </P>
<P>There are a number of trials currently in progress (<LINK REF="STD-Bleijenberg-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Bleijenberg 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Carney-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Carney 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gibson_x002d_Saxty-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Gibson-Saxty 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vissers-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Vissers 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wearden-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Wearden 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-White-2005" TYPE="STUDY">White 2005</LINK>), which will help to strengthen the evidence base on CBT interventions for CFS. The findings of these studies are awaited with interest.</P>

<CHAR_METHODS>
<P>Risk of bias:<BR/>1. Sequence generation: uncertain - practices rather than patients randomised to treatment group (method of sequence generation not specified)<BR/>2. Allocation concealment: uncertain - not specified<BR/>3. Blinding: low - low risk of contamination due to randomisation by practice; self-report measures completed by post<BR/>4. Incomplete outcome data: high - relatively high dropout rate, reported as patient rather than practice dropout; no intention-to-treat analysis; standard deviations missing for all continuous outcomes<BR/>5. Selective outcome reporting: high - no reference to trial protocol but no HADS data reported<BR/>6. Other sources of bias: high - pre-treatment differences in age and symptom duration by group (see below), suggesting GPs may have been more willing to include fatigued patients in the study; lack of information reported on the number of GP practices recruited into the study, therefore not possible to estimate the effect of clustering; no description of management package, and cognitive elements; unclear if sessions in which GPs apparently used the package with CFS patients were recorded; no information on the number of eligible patients and the number who declined; no information on whether patients recruited to study did fulfil CDC criteria (though GPs were trained to refer patients according to criteria); higher uptake from control surgeries, suggests reluctance by intervention GP practices to participate<BR/>
