<P>Babies born in the breech position (bottom first) are at increased risk of complications at birth because of a delay in birth of the head. Turning a breech baby to head first in late pregnancy may reduce these complications. A procedure called 'external cephalic version (ECV)' describes when practitioners use their hands on the woman's abdomen to gently try to turn the baby from the breech position to head first. A number of treatments may help the success of ECV. These include using tocolytic drugs (drugs like beta stimulants and calcium channel blockers that relax the womb), stimulating the baby with sound through the mother&#8217;s abdomen (acoustic stimulation), increasing the fluid surrounding the baby (transabdominal amnioinfusion), injecting pain-relieving drugs into the mother&#8217;s lower back to produce regional analgesia (epidural or spinal analgesia), giving the mother opioid drugs to help her relax, using hypnosis and applying gel or talcum powder to the mother's abdomen.  </P>
<P>This review of trials found 28 randomised controlled studies involving 2786 women. Most studies looked at the effects of tocolytic beta stimulant drugs. Results showed that babies are more likely to turn head first during ECV and to remain head first for the start of labour, if women receive beta stimulants. These drugs also reduced the number of caesarean sections, but insufficient data on possible adverse effects were collected. Little information on other types of tocolytic drugs was available, although nitric oxide donors were associated with an increase in headaches. In addition, too little evidence was available to show whether the other ways of trying to help ECV are effective. Further research is needed if we are to increase the success of ECV.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-03-09 12:24:26 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included 28 studies, providing data on 2786 women. We used the random-effects model for pooling data because of clinical heterogeneity between studies. A number of trial reports gave insufficient information to allow clear assessment of risk of bias. We used GradePro software to carry out formal assessments of quality of the evidence for beta stimulants versus placebo and regional analgesia with tocolysis versus tocolysis alone.</P>
<P>Tocolytic parenteral beta stimulants were effective in increasing cephalic presentations in labour (average risk ratio (RR) 1.68, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.14 to 2.48, five studies, 459 women, low-quality evidence) and in reducing the number of caesarean sections (average RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.88, six studies, 742 women, moderate-quality evidence). Failure to achieve a cephalic vaginal birth was less likely for women receiving a parenteral beta stimulant (average RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.92, four studies, 399 women, moderate-quality evidence). No clear differences in fetal bradycardias were identified, although this was reported for only one study, which was underpowered for assessing this outcome. Failed external cephalic version was reported in nine studies (900 women), and women receiving parenteral beta stimulants were less likely to have failure compared with controls (average RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.82, moderate-quality evidence). Perinatal mortality and serious morbidity were not reported. Sensitivity analysis by study quality was consistent with overall findings.</P>
<P>For other classes of tocolytic drugs (calcium channel blockers and nitric oxide donors), evidence was insufficient to permit conclusions; outcomes were reported for only one or two studies, which were underpowered to demonstrate differences between treatment and control groups. Little evidence was found regarding adverse effects, although nitric oxide donors were associated with increased risk of headache. Data comparing different tocolytic drugs were insufficient.</P>
<P>Regional analgesia in combination with a tocolytic was more effective than the tocolytic alone for increasing successful versions (assessed by the rate of failed ECVs; average RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.86, five studies, 409 women, moderate-quality evidence), and no difference was identified in cephalic presentation in labour (average RR 1.44, 95% CI 0.78 to 2.66, three studies, 279 women, very low-quality evidence), caesarean sections (average RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.40 to 1.37, three studies, 279 women, very low-quality evidence) nor fetal bradycardia (average RR 1.48, 95% CI 0.62 to 3.57, two studies, 210 women, low-quality evidence), although studies were underpowered for assessing these outcomes. Studies did not report on failure to achieve a cephalic vaginal birth (breech vaginal deliveries plus caesarean sections) nor on perinatal mortality or serious infant morbidity.</P>
<P>Data were insufficient on the use of regional analgesia without tocolysis, vibroacoustic stimulation, amnioinfusion, systemic opioids and hypnosis, and on the use of talcum powder or gel to assist external cephalic version, to permit conclusions about their effectiveness and safety.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2015-01-26 10:07:11 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Parenteral beta stimulants were effective in facilitating successful ECV, increasing cephalic presentation in labour and reducing the caesarean section rate, but data on adverse effects were insufficient. Data on calcium channel blockers and nitric acid donors were insufficient to provide good evidence.</P>
<P>The scope for further research is clear. Possible benefits of tocolysis in reducing the force required for successful version and possible risks of side effects need to be addressed further. Further trials are needed to compare the effectiveness of routine versus selective use of tocolysis and the role of regional analgesia, fetal acoustic stimulation, amnioinfusion and abdominal lubricants, and the effects of hypnosis, in facilitating ECV. Although randomised trials of nitric oxide donors are small, the results are sufficiently negative to discourage further trials. Intervention fidelity for ECV can be enhanced by standardisation of the techniques and processes used for clinical manipulation of the fetus in the abdominal cavity and ought to be the subject of further research.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2015-01-26 10:07:26 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2015-01-20 11:09:07 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Breech presentation occurs when the baby is positioned bottom first. It is more common in early pregnancy, and the incidence decreases with increasing gestational age. The incidence at term is about 3% to 4% (<LINK REF="REF-Hickok-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hickok 1992</LINK>). Breech presentation may be caused by an underlying fetal or maternal abnormality, it may be an apparently chance occurrence or it may be related to an otherwise benign variant such as cornual placental position (the placenta situated in an upper lateral corner of the uterus). In the latter two instances, breech presentation places a healthy baby and mother at increased risk of a complicated vaginal birth or caesarean section. Therefore, it is understandable that obstetricians, midwives and consumer groups take considerable interest in this topic. Prevention of harm with reduction of risk for mother and baby is a quantifiable outcome of carefully gathering this research evidence. Knowing what works best for whom and in what circumstances is the concern of clinical researchers working in this field.</P>
<P>Considerable disagreement surrounds the management of breech (bottom first) presentation, with respect to both the place of external cephalic version (ECV) and the type of birth. Interpretation of the findings of non-randomised trials is confounded by the fact that breech presentation per se appears to be a marker for poor perinatal outcome. For example, the incidence of childhood handicap following breech presentation has been found to be high (16%) for both babies born vaginally and those born by caesarean section (<LINK REF="REF-Danielian-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Danielian 1996</LINK>). Randomised trials of planned mode of birth for vaginal breech birth have shown short-term benefit for the breech presenting baby managed by planned caesarean section compared with planned vaginal birth, although the impact on future pregnancies remains uncertain (<LINK REF="REF-Hofmeyr-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hofmeyr 2003</LINK>). Two-year outcomes of one of these randomised trials showed no significant difference in the combined risk of death/neurodevelopmental delay between planned vaginal and planned caesarean groups (<LINK REF="REF-Whyte-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Whyte 2004</LINK>). Despite this, these results have had a profound effect on clinical practice, and in many institutions, caesarean section for breech presentation has become routine. Under these circumstances, the impact of ECV on caesarean section rates would be expected to be greater than was the case in previous trials in institutions in which vaginal breech birth was common. The increased rate of caesarean section for breech presentation has decreased the rate of vaginal breech births, and concern has arisen that practitioners are losing the skill of supporting women who have vaginal breech births.</P>
<P>Breech presentation can be classified as complete, frank or incomplete. A complete breech occurs when the baby&#8217;s hips and knees are flexed, with feet near the buttocks. A frank breech presentation is seen when the baby's legs are extended up to its head. Incomplete breech presentations include a footling breech, in which one or both legs are extended below the baby's bottom, and a kneeling breech, whereby the knees are the presenting part of the breech. Although underlying reasons may explain the breech presentation, the baby may have a more difficult vaginal birth because of the delay in birth of the head.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">External cephalic version</HEADING>
<P>During an ECV, practitioners use their hands on the woman's abdomen to gently try to turn the baby from the breech position to the head-down position. A video of the procedure can be viewed at <A HREF="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKaNZfUno50">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKaNZfUno50</A>.</P>
<P>External cephalic version before term became a part of routine obstetrical practice on the basis of the self-evident immediate effectiveness of the procedure, as well as reassuring results from several non-randomised trials, and in spite of the negative results of the only randomised trial reported before 1980 (<LINK REF="REF-Brosset-1956" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brosset 1956</LINK>). The popularity of ECV before term waned after the mid-1970s, in part because of reports of an increase in perinatal mortality associated with the procedure (<LINK REF="REF-Bradley_x002d_Watson-1975" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bradley-Watson 1975</LINK>), which, in retrospect, may have been due to application of undue force and the increasing perception of caesarean section as a safer option than ECV or breech birth.</P>
<P>Before the mid-1970s, ECV was usually attempted before term because of the belief that the procedure would seldom be successful at term. Subsequent studies showed that with the use of tocolysis, ECV could be achieved in a substantial proportion of women with breech presentation at term (37 or more completed weeks of pregnancy). Predictors of unsuccessful version include engaged presenting part, fetal head not easily palpable and tense uterus (<LINK REF="REF-Lau-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lau 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>Initially, successful ECV at a late stage of pregnancy was considered to have become possible only because of the use of tocolytic drugs to relax the uterus. However, later studies showed that ECV at term was frequently possible without tocolysis.

<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2015-01-26 10:07:26 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>It is important to assess whether various interventions do increase the effectiveness of ECV in turning a breech baby to head first presentation and to help guide their use in clinical practice. Many of these interventions are commonly used, and it is important for doctors to be able to apply evidence-based medicine in this setting to offer the mother the greatest chance of success when undergoing an ECV. It must also be determined whether any of these interventions is associated with possible harm to mother or fetus.</P>

Thus, the intervention 'Regional analgesia' (C) will be compared with placebo, then with tocolytic drugs (A), then with vibroacoustic stimulation (B) and finally with other regional analgesia (C). When C is compared with C, different types of regional analgesia are compared with each other, so epidural may be compared with spinal analgesia as an intervention to facilitate ECV.

<P>The GRADE profiler (<LINK REF="REF-Grade-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grade 2014</LINK>) was used to import data from Review Manager 5.3 (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2014</LINK>) to create &#8217;Summary of findings&#8217; tables. We produced a summary of the intervention effect and a measure of quality for each of the above outcomes by using the GRADE (Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation) approach. The GRADE approach uses five considerations (study limitations, consistency of effect, imprecision, indirectness and publication bias) to assess the quality of the body of evidence for each outcome. Evidence can be downgraded from 'high quality' by one level for serious, or by two levels for very serious, limitations depending on assessments for risk of bias, indirectness of evidence, serious inconsistency, imprecision of effect estimates or potential publication bias.</P>

We have presented data for different classes of tocolytics together in the same forest plots, but we have not pooled results. Findings for different classes of tocolytic drugs are also reported separately in the text, as different classes of drugs have different mechanisms of action. For most outcomes, evidence mainly relates to beta stimulants.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Primary outcomes</HEADING>
<P>We found a statistically significant increase in cephalic presentation at labour and at birth with the use of parenteral beta stimulants (average risk ratio (RR) 1.68, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.14 to 2.48, five studies, 459 women, random-effects Tau² = 0.12, I² = 64%, Chi² P value 0.03, evidence graded as low quality; <LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>). Relatively little evidence was found for other classes of tocolytic drugs. One study with 310 women examined the use of a calcium channel blocker and did not demonstrate a difference between intervention and control groups for cephalic presentation at birth (RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.48); single studies examining parenteral and sublingual nitric oxide donors also showed no statistically significant differences between intervention and control groups (RR 1.58, 95% CI 0.91 to 2.76, participants = 125, and, RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.05, participants = 99, respectively).</P>
<P>Failure to achieve a cephalic vaginal birth was less likely for women receiving a beta stimulant (average RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.92, four studies, 399 women, evidence graded as moderate quality; <LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>). One study examined the use of a sublingual nitric oxide donor and reported no clear evidence of differences between groups (RR 1.22, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.72, participants = 99).</P>
<P>We noted a significant reduction in caesarean sections with the use of beta stimulants to facilitate ECV (average RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.88, participants = 742, six studies, I² = 25%; <LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>). Evidence on the impact of calcium channel blockers and parenteral nitric oxide donors was limited and showed no clear difference in the rates of caesarean section between treatment and control groups (calcium channel blocker: RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.40, one study, participants = 310; parenteral nitric oxide donor: RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.02, one study, participants = 125).</P>
<P>We identified no significant difference in fetal bradycardia in any of the studies reporting this outcome (beta stimulants: RR 2.81, 95% CI 0.12 to 66.17, participants = 58, one study, evidence graded as very low quality; calcium channel blocker: RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.50 to 2.43, participants = 310, one study; oral nitric oxide donor: RR 0.39, 95% CI 0.08 to 1.93, participants = 99, one study; <LINK REF="CMP-001.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.4</LINK>).</P>
<P>Only one class of tocolytic drugs, the beta stimulants, had a reasonable number of trials to allow firm conclusions regarding primary outcomes (<I>see</I> <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Secondary outcomes</HEADING>
<P>We found a statistically significant reduction in failure of ECV when parenteral beta stimulant drugs were used (average RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.82, participants = 900, nine studies, I² = 34%, evidence graded as moderate quality; <LINK REF="CMP-001.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.5</LINK>). For other types of tocolytics (oral beta stimulants, oral calcium channel blockers, parenteral or sublingual nitric oxide donors), evidence was insufficient to demonstrate any differences between groups for failure of ECV (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.79, participants = 45, one study; RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.11, participants = 310, one study; RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.06, participants = 126, one study; average RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.96, participants = 156, two studies, respectively).</P>
<P>Too few studies assessed most of our other secondary outcomes to reveal clear differences between groups.

<P>Two studies examining the use of parenteral or sublingual nitric oxide donors reported maternal headaches, and women receiving active treatment were more likely to experience headache compared with those given placebo (RR 18.68, 95% CI 1.11 to 313.77, participants = 117, and, RR 10.29, 95% CI 2.55 to 41.56, participants = 99, respectively; <LINK REF="CMP-001.08" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.8</LINK>).</P>

Even with these studies temporarily excluded, parenteral beta stimulants still appeared to be effective in achieving cephalic presentation at birth (average RR 2.03, 95% CI 1.49 to 2.77, three studies, 289 women). Findings for the outcome of failure to achieve cephalic vaginal birth remained non-significant for parenteral beta stimulants (average RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.38 to 1.11, two studies, 238 women). There remained a significant reduction in caesarean sections for parenteral beta stimulants when studies at high risk of bias were temporarily removed (average RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.63 to 0.89, four studies, 581 women). Fetal bradycardia remained as showing no significant difference identified.</P>

<P>Parenteral beta stimulants, used to help external cephalic version of breech babies, were effective in increasing the number of women going into labour with their baby in a cephalic presentation and in reducing the number of women undergoing caesarean section. However, data on possible adverse effects are insufficient. Data derived by comparison of other classes of tocolytic drugs (calcium channel blockers and nitric acid donors) were also insufficient. We identified no difference in response between nulliparous women and multiparous women in terms of successful external cephalic version (ECV), babies in the cephalic presentation during labour and caesarean section.</P>

<P>Beta stimulant tocolytics, given parenterally to facilitate external cephalic version of breech babies, increased the number of babies in the cephalic presentation during labour and birth, and reduced the number of caesarean sections performed. However, insufficient data were collected on possible adverse effects on mother or baby. Other groups of tocolytics, calcium channel blockers and nitric acid donors yielded insufficient data to provide good evidence. Data on other possible facilitators of external cephalic version (ECV) were insufficient to provide useful evidence.</P>
<P>Use of regional analgesia in combination with tocolytic drugs increased the rate of success of ECV, but data were insufficient to indicate whether this was associated with an increase in cephalic presentation at birth or a change in the rate of caesarean section.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Routine tocolysis for ECV at term</HEADING>
<P>Further controlled trials of routine tocolysis for ECV at term are needed. In particular, possible benefits of routine tocolysis used to reduce the force required for successful ECV, and possible risks of maternal cardiovascular side effects, need to be addressed further. Additional trials are also needed to compare the effectiveness of routine versus selective use of tocolysis; investigators should include short-term and long-term outcome measures that assess morbidity according to type of birth.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Fetal acoustic stimulation for ECV at term</HEADING>
<P>The results presented in this review are sufficiently encouraging to justify further trials of this procedure. Short-term and long-term outcomes must be assessed.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Regional analgesia for ECV at term</HEADING>
<P>Further trials are needed. The effect of vaginal displacement of the presenting part should be assessed. Fluid received by the regional analgesia group and by the control group should be similar, and whether tocolytic agents should be used adjunctively needs further investigation.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Amnioinfusion for ECV at term</HEADING>
<P>Transabdominal amnioinfusion to increase amniotic fluid volume might facilitate ECV and should be investigated.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Hydration to increase amniotic fluid volume for ECV at term</HEADING>
<P>Intravenous or oral hydration before ECV attempts to increase amniotic fluid volume should be investigated as a separate intervention (<LINK REF="REF-Hofmeyr-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hofmeyr 2002</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Systemic opioids for ECV at term</HEADING>
<P>Given the general adverse effects of opioids (<LINK REF="REF-Bricker-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bricker 2002</LINK>), research might be better focused on other possible facilitators for ECV of breech babies.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Other interventions</HEADING>
<P>Evidence on other interventions such as hypnosis or abdominal lubricants is insufficient; adequately designed and powered trials may throw light on whether such interventions are worthwhile.</P>

<P>We have allocated all outcomes to be primary or secondary outcomes. We have included further interventions examined in recent trials in addition to those originally prespecified in the protocol. We have added an outcome - cephalic vaginal birth not achieved (caesarean section + vaginal breech births) - to enhance consistency with the findings of other related reviews. Additional outcomes are reported that were not specified in the protocol: vaginal breech birth, Apgar less than seven at five minutes, neonatal seizures, admission to neonatal unit, birth trauma, flushing in women, placental abruption, maternal discomfort, pain scores, maternal satisfaction with the procedure and maternal side effects (nausea and vomiting, dizziness and drowsiness).</P>

<P>Post hoc multivariate logistic regression analyses incorporating placental location and allocated treatment as independent co-variables in the analysis with successful ECV and CS reported separately as dependent outcomes. After control for placental location in both models for successful ECV and CS salbutamol, tocolysis remained significantly associated with increased ECV success (adjusted OR 3.4; 95% CI 1.4 to 8.2; decreased CS adjusted OR 3.4; 95% CI 0.14 to 0.79).</P>
