We considered all non-surgical treatments apart from local steroid injection. The primary outcome measure was improvement in clinical symptoms after at least three months following the end of treatment. </P></ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA><ABS_DATA_COLLECTION><P>Three reviewers independently selected the trials to be included. Two reviewers independently extracted data. Studies were rated for their overall quality. Relative risks and weighted mean differences with 95% confidence intervals were calculated for the primary and secondary outcomes in each trial. Results of clinically and statistically homogeneous trials were pooled to provide estimates of the efficacy of non-surgical treatments. </P></ABS_DATA_COLLECTION><ABS_RESULTS><P>Twenty-one trials involving 884 people were included. A hand brace significantly improved symptoms after four weeks (weighted mean difference (WMD) -1.07; 95% confidence interval (CI) -1.29 to -0.85) and function (WMD -0.55; 95% CI -0.82 to -0.28). In an analysis of pooled data from two trials (63 participants) ultrasound treatment for two weeks was not significantly beneficial. However one trial showed significant symptom improvement after seven weeks of ultrasound (WMD -0.99; 95% CI -1.77 to - 0.21) which was maintained at six months (WMD -1.86; 95% CI -2.67 to -1.05). Four trials involving 193 people examined various oral medications (steroids, diuretics, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) versus placebo. Compared to placebo, pooled data for two-week oral steroid treatment demonstrated a significant improvement in symptoms (WMD -7.23; 95% CI -10.31 to -4.14). One trial also showed improvement after four weeks (WMD -10.8; 95% CI -15.26 to -6.34). Compared to placebo, diuretics or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs did not demonstrate significant benefit. In two trials involving 50 people, vitamin B6 did not significantly improve overall symptoms. In one trial involving 51 people yoga significantly reduced pain after eight weeks (WMD -1.40; 95% CI -2.73 to -0.07) compared with wrist splinting. In one trial involving 21 people carpal bone mobilisation significantly improved symptoms after three weeks (WMD -1.43; 95% CI -2.19 to -0.67) compared to no treatment. In one trial involving 50 people with diabetes, steroid and insulin injections significantly improved symptoms over eight weeks compared with steroid and placebo injections. Two trials involving 105 people compared ergonomic keyboards versus control and demonstrated equivocal results for pain and function. Trials of magnet therapy, laser acupuncture, exercise or chiropractic care did not demonstrate symptom benefit when compared to placebo or control. </P></ABS_RESULTS><ABS_CONCLUSIONS><P>Current evidence shows significant short-term benefit from oral steroids, splinting, ultrasound, yoga and carpal bone mobilisation. Other non-surgical treatments do not produce significant benefit. More trials are needed to compare treatments and ascertain the duration of benefit.</P></ABS_CONCLUSIONS></ABSTRACT><BODY MODIFIED="2008-05-05 16:28:53 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><BACKGROUND><P>Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is a condition in which the median nerve at the level of the carpal tunnel undergoes irritation, often attributed to compression (<LINK REF="REF-Kerwin-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kerwin 1996</LINK>). Symptoms of CTS include pain in the wrist and hand which can radiate to the forearm (<LINK REF="REF-Rempel-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rempel 1998</LINK>) and paraesthesiae in the thumb, index, middle and radial half of the ring finger (<LINK REF="REF-Szabo-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Szabo 1994</LINK>). Advanced stages of median nerve compression can result in thenar muscle weakness (<LINK REF="REF-Szabo-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Szabo 1994</LINK>). </P><P>Median nerve compression in the carpal tunnel is the most common example of nerve compression in the body (<LINK REF="REF-Rosenthal-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rosenthal 1987</LINK>). Carpal tunnel syndrome is said to affect one per cent of the population (<LINK REF="REF-Katz-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Katz 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Levine-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Levine 1993</LINK>) but higher rates have been identified in populations of certain occupations such as meat packers (<LINK REF="REF-Hagberg-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hagberg 1992</LINK>) and those with medical conditions such as renal failure (<LINK REF="REF-Katims-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Katims 1989</LINK>). Newport (<LINK REF="REF-Newport-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Newport 2000</LINK>) suggests that the incidence of CTS is increasing, and that with age expectancy of seventy years, 3.5 per cent of males and 11 per cent of females will be affected by CTS. Other studies have observed certain personal characteristics such as obesity to be associated with increased incidence of CTS (<LINK REF="REF-Atroshi-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Atroshi 1999</LINK>). Age and gender have also been found to have an effect upon the incidence of CTS. Females in their fourth and fifth decades suffer CTS four times more commonly than men (<LINK REF="REF-Atroshi-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Atroshi 1999</LINK>).</P><P>Carpal tunnel syndrome does not follow a predictable course. Some patients experience a deterioration in hand function whilst others describe 'silent' periods and intermittent exacerbation of symptoms (<LINK REF="REF-Braun-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Braun 1989</LINK>). Some patients have described spontaneous improvement of symptoms without medical treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Padua-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Padua 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Futami-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Futami 1992</LINK>). The treatment of carpal tunnel syndrome can be categorized into surgical and non-surgical. Surgical treatment is usually offered to those with severe carpal tunnel syndrome, who have constant symptoms, severe sensory disturbance and/ or thenar motor weakness. Non-surgical treatments are offered to those who have the intermittent symptoms of mild to moderate carpal tunnel syndrome. Non-surgical interventions may also be used as a temporary measure while awaiting carpal tunnel release. </P><P>Surgery for CTS involves open or endoscopic division of the flexor retinaculum in order to provide greater space for the contents of the carpal canal. Carpal tunnel release is the most common hand and wrist surgery in the USA, where more than 400,000 carpal tunnel releases are performed annually (<LINK REF="REF-Concannon-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Concannon 2000</LINK>). Surgical treatment options for patients with CTS have been examined in other Cochrane reviews: surgical treatment options for CTS (<LINK REF="REF-Scholten-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scholten 2002</LINK>), and the effect of surgery versus non-surgical treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Verdugo-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Verdugo 2002</LINK>).</P><P>Non-surgical options for the treatment of CTS include many different interventions such as splinting, exercises, yoga, therapeutic ultrasound, activity or ergonomic modification, oral medication and vitamins. Their effectiveness in the management of CTS remain uncertain. As stated above, surgical management of CTS offers relief of symptoms by creating greater space in the carpal canal. Non-surgical treatments for CTS must address different pathophysiological aspects of CTS in order to be successful. For example, splinting of the affected wrist in a neutral position is recommended in order to maintain the wrist in a position that has the lowest intra-canal pressure and therefore the least pressure on the median nerve (<LINK REF="REF-Gelberman-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gelberman 1984</LINK>). </P><P>Yoga was investigated for the treatment of CTS (<LINK REF="STD-Garfinkel-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Garfinkel 1998</LINK>) because stretching may relieve compression in the carpal tunnel, better joint posture may decrease nerve compression, and blood flow may be improved to the median nerve. Stretching exercises for CTS have also been prescribed for the same reason and also to mobilise the median nerve within the carpal canal if it is adherent. </P><P>Activity modification aims to position the wrist in a neutral position to provide maximum space within the carpal canal, and to avoid forceful and repeated movements that are central to occupations associated with increased risk for carpal tunnel syndrome (<LINK REF="REF-Hagberg-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hagberg 1992</LINK>).</P><P>Therapeutic ultrasound is claimed to have an anti-inflammatory effect and has been applied with the aim of healing the median nerve in cases of CTS (<LINK REF="STD-Ebenbichler-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Ebenbichler 1998</LINK>). </P><P>Oral anti-inflammatory medication aims to reduce swelling in the median nerve and other contents within the carpal canal (<LINK REF="REF-Seradge-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Seradge 1994</LINK>). Vitamins in the B group have also been prescribed to relieve symptoms (<LINK REF="REF-Spinner-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spinner 1995</LINK>). </P></BACKGROUND><OBJECTIVES><P>The objective of this review was to compare the effectiveness of non-surgical treatment (other than steroid injection) for carpal tunnel syndrome with no treatment, placebo or another non-surgical treatment for improving clinical outcome.</P></OBJECTIVES><METHODS><SELECTION_CRITERIA><CRIT_STUDIES><P>All published and unpublished studies using or attempting to use a randomised methodology were included.

One reviewer (DOC) compiled all comparisons and entered all outcome data into a computerised database (RevMan 4.1). A second reviewer (NMW) performed double-data entry to ensure accuracy of results. Data were cross-checked by all of the reviewers. For trials where the required data were not reported, further information was requested from the authors by one of the reviewers (DOC).

A descriptive approach to quality assessment was selected rather than use of a scale due to concerns regarding the validity of existing quality scales. Specific considerations for quality assessment of each study included:</P><OL><LI>Was the process of subject recruitment clearly defined?</LI><LI>Was the assigned treatment adequately concealed prior to allocation?</LI><LI>Were care programmes, other than the trial options, the same?</LI><LI>Were the treatment providers blind to assignment status?</LI><LI>Were the subjects blind to assignment status after allocation?</LI><LI>Were withdrawals of patients equal between study groups and explained?</LI><LI>Were the outcome assessors blinded to the treatment status?</LI><LI>Were the outcome measures appropriate and clearly described?</LI></OL><P>Each criterion was graded as met, unmet or unclear with the exception of allocation concealment which was scored as adequate (A), unclear (B), inadequate (C) or not used (D).

The overall quality of individual trials was summarised according to the approach outlined in the Cochrane Reviewers' Handbook (<LINK REF="REF-Clarke-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clarke 1999</LINK>). The risk of bias in a trial was rated as low when all of the criteria were met (A), moderate when one or more criteria were partly met (B), or high when one or more criteria were not met (C).

It evaluated the short-term effects of the nocturnal hand brace on symptoms, hand function, patient-reported change and nerve conduction. A significant effect in favour of nocturnal hand brace use for CTS was demonstrated. The weighted mean difference for improvement in symptoms following two weeks and four weeks of use was -1.03 (95% CI -1.31 to -0.75) and -1.07 (95% CI -1.29 to -0.85) respectively using a 1 to 5 point scale. The weighted mean difference for improvement in hand function following two weeks and four weeks of use was -0.52 (95% CI -0.79 to -0.25) and -0.55 (95% CI -0.82 to -0.28) respectively (1 to 5 point scale). The relative rate of participants reporting overall improvement after four weeks of brace use was 4.00 (95% CI 2.34 to 6.84).

No significant difference in symptom or hand function improvement was demonstrated between the groups over the six-week period. In summary, there is limited evidence that night-only wrist splint use is equally effective as full-time wrist splint use in improving short-term symptoms and hand function .</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="3">Wrist splint: neutral versus 20 degree extension angle</HEADING><P>One trial (<LINK REF="STD-Burke-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Burke 1994</LINK>) with a high bias rating compared the short-term effects of wrist splinting in neutral with splinting in an extended wrist position (20 degrees) on overall, nocturnal and daytime symptoms. A significant effect was demonstrated in favour of the neutral position for wrist splinting in CTS. The relative risk for improvement in overall and nocturnal symptoms at two weeks following fabrication of the neutral wrist splint was 2.43 (95% CI 1.12 to 5.28) and 2.14 (95% CI 0.99 to 4.65) respectively. No effect of wrist position was found for daytime symptoms at two weeks following splint use. In summary, there is limited evidence that neutral wrist splinting results in superior short-term overall and nocturnal symptom relief (at two weeks) when compared with wrist splinting in extension. Furthermore, limited evidence suggests that short-term daytime symptom relief is similar for both splint groups.</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="3">Ultrasound versus placebo</HEADING><P>One trial (<LINK REF="STD-Ebenbichler-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Ebenbichler 1998</LINK>) with a low bias rating and one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Oztas-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Oztas 1998</LINK>) with a moderate bias rating were identified. Although the two trials used different modes of delivery (one pulsed, one continuous, varying frequencies and intensities) they were considered to be sufficiently homogeneous, both clinically and statistically, to pool findings in relation to short-term symptom relief at two weeks. Statistical homogeneity was demonstrated between the trials (Chi-square 0.29; df=1; p=0.59). Both evaluated the short-term effects of ultrasound treatment when compared with a placebo. Long-term effects were also assessed in one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Ebenbichler-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Ebenbichler 1998</LINK>). Both trials assessed symptoms and nerve conduction, while one trial assessed sensation, grip strength, pinch strength and patient-reported improvement (<LINK REF="STD-Ebenbichler-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Ebenbichler 1998</LINK>) and the other assessed pain and nocturnal waking (<LINK REF="STD-Oztas-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Oztas 1998</LINK>). No significant improvement in pain, symptoms, or nocturnal waking was demonstrated in favour of therapeutic ultrasound after two weeks of treatment. No significant improvement in peripheral nerve conduction, grip strength or pinch strength assessed at six months was found after seven weeks of ultrasound treatment. However, a significant effect of ultrasound on symptom improvement was demonstrated after seven weeks of treatment and at six months follow-up (<LINK REF="STD-Ebenbichler-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Ebenbichler 1998</LINK>). The weighted mean difference was -0.99 (95% CI -1.77 to -0.21) and -1.86 (95% CI -2.67 to -1.05) respectively on a 0 to 10 point visual analogue scale (VAS). A significant effect in favour of seven weeks of therapeutic ultrasound was also demonstrated for sensation and self-reported improvement. The weighted mean difference for sensory improvement at six months was -1.18 (95% CI -2.02 to -0.34) on a 0 to 10 point VAS. The relative risk for self-reported improvement at six months was 1.91 (95% CI 1.13 to 3.23). In summary, there is moderate evidence that two weeks of ultrasound treatment does not improve short-term symptoms beyond that achieved with placebo. However, limited evidence does suggest that ultrasound results in superior symptom relief after seven weeks of treatment and beyond a seven week treatment period (assessed at six months) when compared with placebo. There is limited evidence that seven weeks of ultrasound therapy results in better sensory perception and self-reported improvement when compared to placebo. There is limited evidence that short-term pain and nocturnal waking are similar between ultrasound and placebo-treated groups. Furthermore, there is limited evidence that long-term nerve conduction, grip and pinch strength values are similar for ultrasound and placebo groups.</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="3">Ultrasound (various intensities): 1.5 W/cm2 versus 0.8 W/cm2 versus placebo</HEADING><P>One trial (<LINK REF="STD-Oztas-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Oztas 1998</LINK>) with a moderate bias rating compared the short-term effects of continuous ultrasound treatment of different intensities (1.5W/cm2 or 0.8W/cm2) with placebo ultrasound (0.0 W/cm2) on pain, symptoms, nocturnal waking and peripheral nerve conduction. No significant effect of varying intensity of ultrasound delivery was demonstrated for pain, symptoms or nocturnal waking. There is, therefore, limited evidence that continuous ultrasound at 1.5W/cm2 is equally effective in improving short-term pain, symptoms and nocturnal waking as continuous ultrasound at 0.8W/cm2.</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="3">Ultrasound (various frequencies): 1 MHz versus 3 MHz</HEADING><P>One trial (<LINK REF="STD-Koyuncu-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Koyuncu 1995</LINK>) with a high bias rating was identified. It compared the short-term effects of ultrasound with different frequencies (1 MHz or 3 MHz) on pain, paraesthesia, sensation, grasping ability, provocative tests (Phalen, Tinel) and peripheral nerve conduction. No significant effect of varying frequency of ultrasound delivery was demonstrated for pain, paraesthesia, superficial sensation, large or small object grasping ability, Tinel's sign or Phalen's sign. In summary, there is limited evidence that ultrasound delivery at 1 MHz is similar to ultrasound delivery at 3 MHz for pain, paraesthesia, sensation, grasp and provocative testing measures in the short-term.</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="3">Ergonomic keyboard versus standard keyboard</HEADING><P>One trial (<LINK REF="STD-Rempel-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Rempel 1999</LINK>) with a moderate bias rating and one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Tittiranonda-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Tittiranonda 1999</LINK>) with a high bias rating were included. Both trials evaluated the effects of ergonomic keyboard use when compared with a standard keyboard. Outcome measures assessed in both trials included pain, hand function and timed Phalen's test. Phalen's and Tinel's sign (<LINK REF="STD-Tittiranonda-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Tittiranonda 1999</LINK>) and peripheral nerve conduction (<LINK REF="STD-Rempel-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Rempel 1999</LINK>) were also examined. Although the two trials used common outcome measures, one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Rempel-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Rempel 1999</LINK>) reported endpoint scores while the other trial (<LINK REF="STD-Tittiranonda-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Tittiranonda 1999</LINK>) reported change scores for continuous outcomes. Therefore, pooling data for a meta-analysis was not performed. No significant effect in favour of ergonomic keyboard provision was demonstrated for improving Phalen's or Tinel's sign, timed Phalen's test or peripheral nerve conduction. While findings from one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Tittiranonda-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Tittiranonda 1999</LINK>) demonstrated no significant effect of ergonomic keyboard on pain, the other trial (<LINK REF="STD-Rempel-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Rempel 1999</LINK>) did demonstrate an effect in favour of ergonomic keyboard with a weighted mean difference of -2.40 (95% CI -4.45 to -0.35) on a 0 to 10 point scale. Change scores for pain and hand function reported by (<LINK REF="STD-Tittiranonda-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Tittiranonda 1999</LINK>) demonstrated considerable variability (indicated by large standard deviations). Findings demonstrated no effect of two ergonomic keyboard designs (Protouch Keyboard, Comfort Keyboard System) on hand function, but a significant effect in favour of two other styles (Microsoft Natural Keyboard, Apple Adjustable Keyboard) was demonstrated by (<LINK REF="STD-Tittiranonda-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Tittiranonda 1999</LINK>). Mean differences for these keyboards were 1.92 (95% CI 0.84 to 3.00) and 0.93 (95% CI 0.26 to 1.60) respectively (0 to 10 point scale). In summary, limited evidence suggests that ergonomic and standard keyboards provide similar improvements in Phalen's and Tinel's sign, timed Phalen's test and peripheral nerve conduction. There is equivocal evidence regarding the effect of ergonomic keyboards on pain relief and hand function.</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="3">Diuretic treatment versus placebo</HEADING><P>Two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Chang-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Chang 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pal-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Pal 1988</LINK>) with moderate bias ratings were included.

Pal and colleagues (<LINK REF="STD-Pal-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Pal 1988</LINK>) also evaluated the effects of four weeks of diuretic treatment on carpal tunnel symptoms and median nerve latency when compared to a placebo. No significant effect in favour of diuretic treatment was demonstrated for improving carpal tunnel symptoms. A significant effect of diuretic treatment on peripheral nerve conduction was reported by Pal (<LINK REF="STD-Pal-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Pal 1988</LINK>), but the actual values of the outcome measures were not published.

No significant effect in favour of NSAID treatment was demonstrated for improving carpal tunnel symptoms. In summary, limited evidence suggests that NSAID treatment does not improve short-term symptoms in CTS.</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="3">Oral steroids versus placebo</HEADING><P>Two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Chang-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Chang 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Herskovitz-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Herskovitz 1995</LINK>) with moderate bias ratings and one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Hui-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Hui 2001</LINK>) with a low bias rating were included. All three trials assessed symptom improvement following short-term treatment with oral steroids, either using prednisolone (<LINK REF="STD-Chang-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Chang 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hui-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Hui 2001</LINK>) or prednisone (<LINK REF="STD-Herskovitz-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Herskovitz 1995</LINK>). There was a minor variation in treatment length between two of the trials (<LINK REF="STD-Herskovitz-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Herskovitz 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hui-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Hui 2001</LINK>) of two weeks and 10 days respectively, but it was felt that this did not pose a significant threat to clinical homogeneity. All three trials were pooled in relation to short-term symptom improvement after two weeks of treatment. There was no significant statistical heterogeneity between the trials (Chi-square 0.80; df=2; p=0.67). A significant effect in favour of oral steroids was demonstrated on symptom improvement with two and four weeks of treatment. The pooled weighted mean difference for improvement of symptoms after two weeks of treatment was -7.23 (95% CI -10.31 to -4.14) on a 0 to 50 point scale. This significant positive effect of oral steroids was also demonstrated after four weeks of treatment with weighted mean difference for symptoms of -10.8 (95% CI -15.26 to -6.34) (<LINK REF="STD-Chang-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Chang 1998</LINK>). However, findings from one of the trials (<LINK REF="STD-Herskovitz-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Herskovitz 1995</LINK>) demonstrated that the benefit of two weeks of oral steroid treatment on symptoms is lost after an additional two weeks of no treatment. The weighted mean difference for symptoms assessed at two weeks following the end of two-week treatment period was -6.19 (95% CI -15.14 to 2.76) (0 to 50 point scale). Two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Herskovitz-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Herskovitz 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hui-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Hui 2001</LINK>) examined the effect of oral steroid at six weeks following cessation of treatment. Findings from one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Herskovitz-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Herskovitz 1995</LINK>) demonstrated no effect, while the other (<LINK REF="STD-Hui-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Hui 2001</LINK>) found continued benefit from oral steroid use on symptoms at six weeks following treatment cessation. There was no significant heterogeneity between these two trials (Chi-square 2.11; df=1; p=0.15). The pooled weighted mean difference for improvement of carpal tunnel symptoms at eight weeks (six weeks following treatment end) was -6.46 (95% CI -11.93 to -0.99) (0- to 50-point scale). In summary, there is moderate evidence that oral steroid treatment for two weeks improves short-term symptoms.

Both trials evaluated the medium-term effects of oral vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) as compared to a placebo. Although the treatment duration differed slightly between trials (12 and 10 weeks respectively), the dosage and delivery methods were identical. All except one outcome measure used between trials were different which prevented pooling of results. The outcome measured in both trials, peripheral nerve conduction, did not meet our outcome criteria and so was not included in analysis. The other outcomes evaluated were nocturnal discomfort, finger swelling, movement discomfort, hand co-ordination, Phalen's sign and Tinel's sign (<LINK REF="STD-Spooner-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Spooner 1993</LINK>) and symptoms (<LINK REF="STD-Stransky-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Stransky 1989</LINK>). No significant effect of vitamin B6 was demonstrated for improvement in symptoms, nocturnal discomfort, hand co-ordination, Phalen's sign or Tinel's sign after 10 to 12 weeks of treatment. However, a significant effect in favour of vitamin B6 was demonstrated for finger swelling and movement discomfort after 12 weeks of intervention. The weighted mean difference for finger swelling was -1.00 (95% CI -1.90 to -0.10) and for movement discomfort was -1.00 (95% CI -1.94 to -0.06) on 0 to 4 point scales. There is, therefore, limited evidence that vitamin B6 improves finger swelling and movement discomfort with 12 weeks of treatment.

It evaluated the medium-term effects of performing nerve and tendon gliding exercises and using a wrist splint for 4 weeks on symptoms, hand function, grip strength, pinch strength, two-point discrimination, Tinel's sign, Phalen's sign and patient satisfaction when compared with wrist splinting alone. No significant effect in favour of nerve and tendon gliding exercises was demonstrated for improving symptoms, hand function, grip strength, pinch strength, Phalen's sign, Tinel's sign or patient satisfaction at eight weeks following the four week exercise program. However, a significant effect of gliding exercises on static two-point discrimination was demonstrated at eight weeks following treatment end. The weighted mean difference was -0.70 millimetres (95% CI -1.24 to -0.16). In summary, there is limited evidence that nerve and tendon gliding exercises and wrist splinting result in superior static two-point discrimination compared to wrist splinting alone in the medium-term.

No significant effect in favour of yoga was demonstrated for improving nocturnal waking, Tinel's sign or grip strength after eight weeks of treatment. However, a significant effect of yoga on improving pain and Phalen's sign was demonstrated after eight weeks of treatment. The weighted mean difference for pain was -1.40 (95% CI -2.73 to -0.07) on a 0 to 10 point VAS and the relative risk for Phalen's sign was 5.25 (95% CI 1.28 to 21.47). In summary, there is limited evidence that yoga results in superior short-term pain relief and improved outcome for Phalen's sign compared to wrist splinting.

The upper limb tension test is a specific tension test which is used to bias the median nerve (previously reported by Butler (<LINK REF="REF-Butler-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Butler 1991</LINK>)). It is performed to reproduce symptoms or identify changes in existing symptoms.

No significant effect in favour of neurodynamic mobilisation was demonstrated for improving symptoms, pain, hand function, active wrist motion, upper limb tension test or need for surgical release after three weeks of treatment.

In summary, limited evidence suggests that there is no significant benefit of neurodynamic over carpal bone mobilisation for improving short-term CTS outcomes.</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="3">Magnet therapy versus placebo</HEADING><P>One trial (<LINK REF="STD-Carter-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Carter 2002</LINK>) with a moderate bias rating was included. It evaluated the short-term effect of applying a magnetic device over the carpal tunnel (for 45 minutes) on pain compared with a placebo device. No significant effect in favour of magnetic therapy was demonstrated for improving pain directly following treatment or after two weeks. In summary, limited evidence suggests that magnet therapy does not significantly improve short-term pain relief in CTS.</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="3">Chiropractic treatment (manual thrusts, myofascial massage/loading, ultrasound and nocturnal wrist splint) versus medical treatment (ibuprofen and nocturnal wrist splint)</HEADING><P>One trial (<LINK REF="STD-Davis-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Davis 1998</LINK>) with a high bias rating was included. It assessed the effect of chiropractic care (comprising various interventions: manual thrusts, myofascial massage and loading, ultrasound and nocturnal wrist splint) on physical distress, mental distress, vibrometry, hand function, health-related quality of life and peripheral nerve conduction when compared to medical treatment (ibuprofen and wrist splint). No significant effect of chiropractic care was demonstrated for improving mental distress, vibrometry, hand function or health-related quality of life after nine weeks of treatment. However, a significant effect favouring medical treatment on improving physical distress was demonstrated. The weighted mean difference was 3.51 (95% CI 0.09 to 6.93) on a 0 to 64 point scale. In summary, there is limited evidence that medical care over nine weeks improves physical distress in the short-term when compared with chiropractic treatment. Limited evidence also suggests that chiropractic and medical treatment provide similar short-term improvement in mental distress, vibrometry, hand function and health-related quality of life.</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="3">Laser acupuncture versus placebo</HEADING><P>One trial (<LINK REF="STD-Aigner-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Aigner 1999</LINK>) with a moderate bias rating was included. It evaluated the short-term effect of laser acupuncture applied to various acupuncture points on paraesthesiae and night pain compared with a placebo laser. No significant difference in paraesthesiae or night pain was demonstrated between laser acupuncture and placebo over a three-week treatment period. In summary, limited evidence suggests that laser acupuncture does not improve short-term paraesthesiae and night pain in CTS.</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="3">Steroid and insulin injections versus steroid and placebo injections</HEADING><P>One trial (Ozkul 2001) with a moderate bias rating was included. It evaluated the medium and long-term effects of steroid injection into the carpal tunnel followed by weekly injections of insulin on symptoms and peripheral nerve conduction when compared with steroid injection into the carpal tunnel followed by weekly placebo injections. A significant effect in favour of steroid plus insulin injections on symptom and nerve conduction values was demonstrated over steroid plus placebo group. The weighted mean difference for each outcome could not be calculated as point estimates and measures of variability were not reported in the published trial. Attempts to obtain the raw data from the authors were unsuccessful. In summary, limited evidence suggests that a steroid injection followed by weekly insulin injections into the carpal tunnel for eight weeks results in superior symptom relief and nerve conduction compared with steroid injection and weekly placebo injections over the same period.</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="3">Sensitivity analyses</HEADING><P>Sensitivity analyses were performed where data were combined from more than one trial to estimate the effect of non-surgical treatment for CTS. Pooled weighted mean differences were calculated to provide estimates of the efficacy of ultrasound (<LINK REF="STD-Ebenbichler-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Ebenbichler 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Oztas-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Oztas 1998</LINK>) and oral steroid use (<LINK REF="STD-Chang-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Chang 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Herskovitz-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Herskovitz 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hui-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Hui 2001</LINK>) on symptoms. No change in the effect of either treatment on symptom improvement was found when the effect of methodological quality and quality of diagnostic criteria was examined. It was not possible to conduct sensitivity analysis to test the effect of symptom severity and gender due to inadequate information.</P></SUBSECTION></INTERVENTION_EFFECTS></RESULTS><DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2008-05-05 16:20:48 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>We set out to determine the effectiveness of non-surgical treatments (other than steroid injection) when compared with no treatment, a placebo, or with other non-surgical treatments for improving clinical outcome in persons with CTS. Twenty-one trials which investigated splinting, therapeutic ultrasound, ergonomic keyboards, oral medication, vitamins, exercise, yoga, carpal mobilisation, magnet therapy, chiropractic care, laser acupuncture and insulin injection were included.</P><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="2">Methodological quality of the trials</HEADING><P>Between one and three RCTs were found regarding each treatment, providing some moderate but mainly limited evidence that will be discussed below, in order of strongest evidence first. The quality of the trials was mostly moderate or low when the bias scoring approach outlined by Clarke (<LINK REF="REF-Clarke-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clarke 1999</LINK>) in the Cochrane Reviewers' Handbook was applied. The scoring system disadvantaged trials in which blinding of treatment providers and participants could not be achieved. Several trials, (i.e. splinting, tendon and nerve gliding exercise etc), were unable to blind treatment providers and subjects to the treatment, and these trials received a high bias rating. In contrast trials which could minimise performance bias by double blinding had the potential to be rated as having moderate or low bias. This scoring approach places therapy trials where blinding is not possible at a disadvantage when compared with trials where blinding of intervention is achievable. One element of the studies that was not reviewed was the power of the negative studies to assure that a type II error did not occur due to insufficient sample size.</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="2">Quality of diagnostic criteria</HEADING><P>The criteria proposed by Rempel and colleagues (<LINK REF="REF-Rempel-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rempel 1998</LINK>) were used to judge the diagnostic quality in this review. Rempel and colleagues advocate the combination of electrodiagnostic findings and symptoms to diagnose CTS. The American Academies of Neurology, Electrodiagnostic Medicine and Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (<LINK REF="REF-AAN-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">AAN 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jablecki-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jablecki 2002</LINK>) outline electrodiagnostic studies accepted as appropriate for confirmation of CTS diagnosis. Seventeen of the 21 trials included in this review reported a combination of electrodiagnostic findings and symptoms. A statement by the authors confirming the use of electrodiagnostic testing in combination with the assessment of clinical symptoms was considered to satisfy this criterion.</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="2">Outcome measures</HEADING><P>We performed a detailed assessment of the outcome measures used in the included trials. The review highlighted a wide variation in the outcome measures assessed, the lack of evidence regarding their reliability, validity and responsiveness in CTS populations, and the varied and predominantly short-term nature of outcome assessment across trials (i.e. majority of trials only measured outcome at conclusion of treatment). In fact, only three studies used our recommended primary outcome measure of symptom improvement at least three months post intervention. These features meant that pooling of results was rarely possible, interpretation of the clinical significance and accuracy of findings was made difficult, and little information about the medium to long-term effects of non-surgical treatments can be concluded. Furthermore, most studies failed to quantify the severity of CTS leaving open the question of whether or not different severities of CTS respond similarly.</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="2">Evidence for non-surgical treatment of CTS</HEADING><P>Moderate evidence (consistent findings in more than one RCT) suggests that there is no significant improvement immediately following two weeks of therapeutic ultrasound. This effect was demonstrated by pooling the results from one high quality and one moderate quality trial, both using high quality diagnostic criteria for CTS.</P><P>Moderate evidence supports a positive effect on symptoms immediately following oral steroid treatment for a two-week period. This effect was reached by pooling data from three trials of high and moderate methodological quality, in which good diagnostic criteria were used. Systemic adverse effects from oral steroids are quite common, however these did not appear limiting in these trials using short courses of oral steroids. The weighted mean difference in symptom severity between the oral steroid and placebo groups was demonstrated to be just over seven points on a global symptom score, with 95% confidence limits ranging from 4 to 10 points. The global symptom score is a patient rating of symptom severity across five areas (pain, numbness, paraesthesiae, weakness/clumsiness, nocturnal waking) with the global score ranging from 0 (no symptoms) to 50 (worst symptoms). Unfortunately there is no evidence regarding the reliability, validity and responsiveness of the global symptom score used in the oral steroid trials.</P><P>The treatment effects for ultrasound and oral steroid treatment remained consistent when sensitivity analyses were conducted to examine the effect of methodological quality and diagnostic quality.</P><P>Limited evidence (findings from one RCT) suggests that therapeutic ultrasound for seven weeks provides a positive short to long-term effect on symptom severity. This finding is derived from one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Ebenbichler-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Ebenbichler 1998</LINK>) rated as having high methodological and diagnostic quality. The average difference in symptom severity between the ultrasound and placebo groups at six months was reported to be almost two points on a visual analogue scale (95% confidence limits ranging from 1.05 to 2.67). The visual analogue scale is used to quantify symptom severity and ranges from 0 (no symptoms) to 10 (worst symptoms). This difference is likely to be of clinical significance. This treatment also provides a positive effect on sensation and patient-reported improvement when assessed at six months. The average difference in patient-reported sensation between the ultrasound and placebo groups was reported to be just over one point on a visual analogue scale, and the relative likelihood that patients receiving ultrasound will report improvement at six months is almost double that of patients in the placebo group.</P><P>Limited evidence supports a positive short-term effect on symptoms following the use of a hand splint for two or four weeks. The average difference in symptom severity between the hand brace and control groups at the end of the treatment period is reported to be approximately one point on the carpal tunnel questionnaire (95% confidence intervals ranging from 0.75 to 1.31). The scale used to quantify symptom severity ranges from 1 point (no symptoms) to 5 points (very severe symptoms). There is evidence of reliability, validity and responsiveness of the questionnaire in CTS populations, and that this difference in symptom severity is likely to be clinically significant (<LINK REF="REF-Amadio-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Amadio 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Katz-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Katz 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Levine-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Levine 1993</LINK>). This finding is derived from one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Manente-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Manente 2001</LINK>) rated as using high quality diagnostic criteria for CTS but also a high risk of performance bias. There is a relative likelihood that patients using the hand splint will report improvement, almost four times more than patients who receive no treatment.</P><P>Limited evidence supports a positive short-term effect on symptom severity when splinting the wrist in neutral as compared to the wrist in extension. It is twice as likely that patients using the neutral wrist splint will report overall and nocturnal symptom relief after two weeks than patients who receive a wrist splint in extension. This was reported by one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Burke-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Burke 1994</LINK>) of poor methodological quality and diagnostic criteria of moderate quality. Hence, caution should be used in the interpretation of this finding due to these limitations.</P><P>Limited evidence suggests that an eight-week yoga treatment provides short-term improvements in pain when compared with the use of a wrist splint. The average difference in pain severity between the yoga and wrist splint groups was 1.4 points on a visual analogue scale (95% confidence intervals ranging from 0.07 to 2.73 points). The visual analogue scale was used to quantify pain severity and ranges from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst possible pain). This difference is likely to be of clinical significance. This treatment also provides a positive effect on provocative testing when assessed at eight weeks. The relative likelihood that patients receiving yoga treatment will experience an improvement in Phalen's sign is around five times that of patients in the splint group. These findings were derived from one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Garfinkel-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Garfinkel 1998</LINK>) rated as using high quality diagnostic criteria for CTS but having a high risk of selection, performance and detection bias.</P><P>Limited evidence suggests that carpal bone mobilisation over a three-week period provides positive short-term benefit on symptoms. The average difference in symptoms between the mobilisation and the control groups was 1.4 points on a visual analogue scale, (95% confidence limits ranging from 0.67 to 2.19). This finding is derived from one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Tal_x002d_Akabi-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Tal-Akabi 2000</LINK>) having high quality diagnostic criteria for CTS but having also a high risk of selection and performance bias.</P><P>Limited evidence suggests that vitamin B6 for 12 weeks decreases finger swelling and movement discomfort when assessed at the end of treatment. The average difference in symptoms between the vitamin B6 and placebo groups for both outcomes was around one point on a short ordinal scale. The scale rated symptom severity as 0 (none) to 4 (a great deal). It is unclear whether these differences in outcome represent clinically meaningful findings. The validity of these findings might be enhanced if they were converted to dichotomous data. Green and Deeks advise that short ordinal scales should not be treated as continuous variables but instead treated as binary outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-Green-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Green 2002</LINK>). The authors reported these outcomes as continuous variables only.</P><P>Limited evidence suggests that medical care for nine weeks provides a small but significant benefit in terms of physical distress (function) when compared with chiropractic care. The average difference in physical distress between the medical and chiropractic groups was 3.5 points on a long ordinal scale. Participants' physical distress was measured by their responses to 16 questions about difficulty in daily activities. The physical distress score ranged from 0 (no difficulty) to 64 (extreme difficulty). It is unclear whether the difference between the groups constitutes a clinically significant finding.</P><P>Nerve and tendon gliding exercises performed over four weeks in combination with a wrist splint improved two-point discrimination when assessed at three months, and compared to wrist splinting alone. The average difference in two-point discrimination between the two groups was 0.70 of a millimetre. This difference was not considered clinically significant. Whilst two-point discrimination has fair to good reliability in CTS populations (<LINK REF="REF-Marx-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marx 1998</LINK>), such a small difference would be likely to be overshadowed by measurement error.</P><P>This systematic review was conducted according to the methods stipulated in the protocol. However, future revisions will divide up the content into reviews of related non-surgical treatments to reduce the overall size of the review and facilitate usefulness for the reader.</P><P>The following would enhance future studies:</P><OL><LI>Use of electrodiagnostic findings (<LINK REF="REF-AAN-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">AAN 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jablecki-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jablecki 2002</LINK>) in combination with symptoms for CTS diagnosis.</LI><LI>Documentation and classification of severity and duration of symptoms of participants.</LI><LI>Short and long-term assessment of treatment outcome (minimally at the end of treatment and at least three months following the end of treatment; and ideally up to one or two years after treatment).</LI><LI>Use of outcome measures which have been assessed for reliability, validity and sensitivity to change in CTS populations.</LI><LI>Consensus of outcome measurement across trials to facilitate meta-analysis.</LI><LI>Prospective power analysis to detect clinically meaningful differences in outcome.</LI><LI>Analysis of direct and indirect costs associated with treatment.</LI></OL></SUBSECTION></DISCUSSION><CONCLUSIONS><IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE><P>Moderate evidence shows significant short-term benefit from oral steroids. Limited evidence shows significant short-term benefit from splinting, ultrasound, yoga and carpal bone mobilisation. Other non-surgical treatments do not produce significant benefit.</P></IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE><IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH><P>More high quality research is needed to strengthen the moderate to limited evidence currently available on non-surgical treatment. Future research needs to examine the relative contributions of different non-surgical treatments for CTS, the optimal forms of delivery, the duration of any benefit (both during active treatment and after treatment cessation) and the optimal timing of delivery during the course of CTS. More high quality studies are required to establish better evidence to direct clinical practice. </P></IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH></CONCLUSIONS></BODY><ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS><P>We would like to thank Malgorzata Bala, Duray Seker, Usha Buenger and other colleagues for their assistance in translating abstracts and papers for this review.</P><P>We thank Louisa Dunn, Kate Jewitt, Carolyn Reid and Angela Gunn from the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group for their assistance in devising the search strategy, helping to locate people to translate the non-English trials and ongoing support for this review.</P><P>We thank the trialists (Nicholas Aigner, Elif Akalin, Cheryl Aspy, David Burke, Ming-Hong Chang, Gerold Ebenbichler, Steven Herskovitz, Neil Lava, Yasar Ozkul, B Pal, David Rempel, Rick Spooner, Amir Tal-Akabi, Antonino Uncini, William Walker, SM Wong) who corresponded with the principal reviewer to clarify additional information and/or provided additional data for the review. </P><P>We thank the following institutions for their support during the review:<BR/>The School of Occupational Therapy, University of South Australia, Adelaide, AUSTRALIA <BR/>The Institute for Rehabilitation Research and Development, Ottawa, CANADA</P></ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS><CONFLICT_OF_INTEREST><P>None</P></CONFLICT_OF_INTEREST><CONTRIBUTIONS MODIFIED="2008-05-05 16:22:24 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>The primary reviewer (DOC) co-ordinated each stage of the review and was responsible for:</P><OL><LI>the conception and design of the review (in collaboration with NMW and SM);</LI><LI>developing the protocol (in collaboration with SM and NMW);</LI><LI>developing the search strategy in collaboration with the Neuromuscular Disease Review Group;</LI><LI>undertaking the searches for trials;</LI><LI>screening the search results;</LI><LI>organising retrieval of papers;</LI><LI>screening retrieved papers against inclusion/exclusion criteria (independently of, but in addition to SM and NMW);</LI><LI>appraising the quality of papers (independently of, but in addition to SM);</LI><LI>abstracting data from papers (independently of, but in addition to SM);</LI><LI>writing to authors of papers for additional information;</LI><LI>providing additional data about papers;</LI><LI>entering data into RevMan 4.1;</LI><LI>compiling the list of comparisons, table of included and excluded studies, reference lists;</LI><LI>performing analysis of data;</LI><LI>interpreting the findings;</LI><LI>writing the review;</LI><LI>final approval of the version to be published.</LI></OL><P>The second reviewer (SM) was involved in the following stages of the review:</P><OL><LI>the design of the review (in collaboration with DOC and NMW);</LI><LI>developing the protocol (in collaboration with DOC and NMW);</LI><LI>screening the search results (independently of, but in addition to DOC and NMW);</LI><LI>screening the retrieved papers against inclusion/exclusion criteria(independently of, but in addition to DOC and NMW);</LI><LI>appraising the quality of the papers (independently of, but in addition to DOC);</LI><LI>abstracting data from papers (independently of, but in addition to DOC);</LI><LI>contributing to the writing of the review.</LI></OL><P>The third reviewer (NMW) was involved in the following stages of the review:</P><OL><LI>the conception and design of the review (in collaboration with DOC and SM);</LI><LI>developing the protocol (in collaboration with DOC and SM);</LI><LI>screening the search results (independently of, but in addition to DOC and SM);</LI><LI>screening the retrieved papers against inclusion/exclusion criteria (independently of, but in addition to DOC and SM);</LI><LI>summarising the quality appraisal of the trials (rated independently by DOC and SM);</LI><LI>performing double-data entry;</LI><LI>contributing to the writing of the review.</LI></OL></CONTRIBUTIONS><PRO_REV_DIFF/><PUBLIC_NOTES MODIFIED="2017-12-13 18:30:50 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Ruth Brassington"><P>This review will be updated by the publication of new Cochrane reviews and the change in scope of an existing review<I>.</I> When all new titles are published we will withdraw this review from publication.

LEVEL="4">Date received: 09 February 2006</HEADING><P>In the results section for ultrasound therapy you state that:"In summary, there is moderate evidence that two weeks of ultrasound treatment does not improve short-term symptoms beyond that achieved with placebo". Your statement rest upon 2 trials, the moderate bias trial by Oztas, and the low bias(high quality) trial by Ebenbichler. Your statement is contradicted by the Ebenbichler trial report which found significant effects after 2 weeks for the main complaint p = 0.015 and 3 of 6 secondary outcomes.</P><P>In the symptoms analysis of ultrasound, I could not find the 2 weeks data you have used in the original Ebenbichler trial report. Where are they taken from? Are they 2 weeks data or data of change from baseline to 2 weeks?</P><P>The negative results and possibly reported harm for motor nerve conduction in the Oztas trial, may be due to the high continuous intensities of 0.8 and 1.5 W/cm2, while the Ebenbichler study used an intensity 0.2 W/cm2 when adjusted for pulsed mode.<BR/>Why do you not make a dose analysis which could show that the different results may arise from different doses; i.e. and simply state that average intensity at 0.2 W/cm2 seems effective, while average intensities of 0.8 and 1.5 are ineffective?</P><P>Jan M Bjordal</P></SUBSECTION></FEEDBACK_SUMMARY><FEEDBACK_REPLY MODIFIED="2008-05-05 16:23:40 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="4">Denise O'Connor</HEADING></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="4">Date received: 25 August 2006</HEADING><P>Dear Jan Bjordal,</P><P>Thank you for your comment regarding our review on non-surgical treatment (other than steroid injection) for carpal tunnel syndrome, and more specifically, our findings comparing ultrasound vs. placebo.</P><P>The outcome data that you refer to in the text and that are displayed in Analysis 04.02 (Comparison: ULTRASOUND vs. PLACEBO; Outcome: symptoms) are endpoint mean and standard deviation values that were provided to us by the trial investigators (personal communication with Gerold Ebenbichler, dated 5 March 2002). We make reference to the use of this data in the notes section of the 'Characteristics of Included Studies' table where we report "Mean and standard deviation values for symptoms, sensation, grip strength, pinch strength and nerve conduction outcomes were provided by authors to facilitate entry into RevMan". We used endpoint data provided by Ebenbichler 1998 in favour of the change scores reported in their publication to facilitate pooling with data from the Oztas 1998 trial (which reported endpoint scores). At the time of publishing the review, the Cochrane Handbook did not advise combining endpoint and change scores in meta-analyses.</P><P>We did not undertake a dose-response analysis in relation to motor nerve conduction because the primary objective of the review was to compare the effectiveness of non-surgical treatment with control, placebo or other non-surgical treatments for CTS and we did not set out a priori to explore the relationship between dose and the size of treatment effect as a secondary aim of the review. However, we intend to investigate this in our next update of the review.</P><P>I hope this response has clarified the issues you identified. Thank you for your interest in our review.</P><P>Yours sincerely,</P><P>Denise O'Connor on behalf of the review team</P></SUBSECTION></FEEDBACK_REPLY><FEEDBACK_CONTRIBUTORS><P>Denise O'Connor</P></FEEDBACK_CONTRIBUTORS></FEEDBACK_ITEM></FEEDBACK><APPENDICES MODIFIED="2008-05-05 16:27:56 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><APPENDIX ID="APP-01" MODIFIED="2008-05-05 16:27:56 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]" NO="1"><TITLE MODIFIED="2008-05-05 16:26:32 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">MEDLINE on OVID (1996 to Week 5 2001) search strategy</TITLE><APPENDIX_BODY MODIFIED="2008-05-05 16:27:56 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>1 randomized controlled trial.pt.<BR/>2 randomized controlled trials/<BR/>3 controlled clinical trial.pt.<BR/>4 controlled clinical trials/<BR/>5 random allocation/<BR/>6 double-blind method/<BR/>7 single-blind method/<BR/>8 clinical trial.pt.<BR/>9 exp clinical trials/<BR/>10 (clin$ adj25 trial$).tw.<BR/>11 ((singl$ or doubl$ or tripl$ or trebl$) adj25 (blind$ or mask$ or dummy)).tw.<BR/>12 placebos/<BR/>13 placebo$.tw.<BR/>14 random$.tw.<BR/>15 research design/<BR/>16 (clinical trial phase i or clinical trial phase ii or clinical trial phase iii or clinical trial phase iv).pt.<BR/>17 multicenter study.pt.<BR/>18 meta analysis.pt.<BR/>19 prospective studies/<BR/>20 intervention studies/<BR/>21 cross-over studies/<BR/>22 meta-analysis/<BR/>23 (meta?analys$ or systematic review$).tw.<BR/>24 control$.tw.<BR/>25 or/1-24<BR/>26 human/<BR/>27 25 and 26<BR/>28 Carpal tunnel syndrome/dt,rh,th [Drug Therapy, Rehabilitation, Therapy]<BR/>29 27 and 28</P></APPENDIX_BODY></APPENDIX></APPENDICES><EXTENSIONS/></COCHRANE_REVIEW>
