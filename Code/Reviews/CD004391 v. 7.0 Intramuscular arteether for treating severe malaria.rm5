<P>People with severe malaria are unconscious, have difficulty breathing, may convulse, and have low blood sugar. They need to be treated quickly, but because of their illness cannot take drugs by mouth. Arteether, an artemisinin derivative, is a possible alternative to the standard drug quinine. There are two types, artemotil and alpha/beta arteether, both are which are given as an intramuscular injection once a day. The authors of this review wanted to compare intramuscular arteether with other drugs used to treat severe malaria. They identified two small trials with 194 participants. Both trials compared arteether with quinine in children with cerebral malaria (an unrousable coma that cannot be attributed to any other cause other than malaria). There was no difference between the drugs in the number of deaths, people with neurological symptoms, or other outcomes, but there were probably too few participants to detect differences.<BR/>

</ABSTRACT>
<BODY MODIFIED="2011-04-13 15:47:54 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Severe malaria, mostly due to <I>Plasmodium falciparum</I> infection, accounts for over one million deaths each year (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2000</LINK>). Most people with severe malaria require drugs by injections (intravenous or intramuscular) or given rectally. This is because people with severe malaria have a severe illness such as cerebral malaria (an unrousable coma that cannot be attributed to any other cause other than malaria) or repeated generalized convulsions, which may prevent them from taking oral medication, in addition to falciparum malaria parasites in their blood. Quinine has been the most widely used drug for severe malaria (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2000</LINK>), but it can cause low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) (<LINK REF="REF-Okitolonda-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Okitolonda 1987</LINK>), ringing of the ears (tinnitus), high-tone hearing impairment, depressed mood (dysphoria), nausea, and vomiting (<LINK REF="REF-White-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">White 2000</LINK>). Also, a decrease in quinine sensitivity has been recorded in areas of extensive use such as South-East Asia (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2001</LINK>) and some parts of Africa (<LINK REF="REF-Mutanda-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mutanda 1999</LINK>). </P>
<P>Artemisinin and its derivatives have been considered as alternatives to quinine because they are known to be effective against multiple-drug-resistant malaria parasites (<LINK REF="REF-White-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">White 1998</LINK>), produce faster relief of symptoms and clearance of parasites than any other antimalarial drug (<LINK REF="REF-White-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">White 2000</LINK>), and resistance towards them has not been documented. Artemether, artesunate, and artemisinin are used to treat severe malaria (<LINK REF="REF-White-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">White 2000</LINK>). For non-oral administration, artemether is available as intramuscular injection, artemisinin as rectal suppositories, and artesunate as rectal, intramuscular, and intravenous preparations (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2001</LINK>). Their elimination half lives vary from 45 minutes for intravenous artesunate, 4 to 11 hours for artemether, and 0 to 6 hours for rectal artemisinin (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1993</LINK>). Artemisinin is not very soluble in water or oil, artemether is oil soluble (lipophilic), and artesunate is water soluble (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2001</LINK>). The more lipophilic a drug is, the more likely it is to accumulate in brain tissue, which may be beneficial in cerebral malaria (<LINK REF="REF-Kain-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kain 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2002</LINK>). However, a previous systematic review concluded that there was insufficient evidence to believe one of these derivatives was better than the rest (<LINK REF="REF-McIntosh-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">McIntosh 2003</LINK>). </P>
<P>Arteether is an ethyl ether derivative of artemisinin that has recently been evaluated. It is oil soluble, has a long elimination half life (greater than 20 hours), and is more stable than the other artemisinin compounds (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2001</LINK>). Artemotil (previously known as beta arteether) and alpha/beta arteether are the two available formulations. Artemotil was registered in the Netherlands in May 2000 (<LINK REF="REF-Lugt-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lugt 2002</LINK>). Its use is restricted to children and adolescents under the age of 16 because of the possibility that it may have an effect on the heart, as some electrocardiogram abnormalities have been seen in some trials of artemotil (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2002</LINK>). Alpha/beta arteether was registered in India in January 1997 for use in both children and adults with severe malaria (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2002</LINK>). High doses of arteether have caused damage to tissues of the nervous system and heart in animal studies (<LINK REF="REF-Brewer-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brewer 1994</LINK>), but there is less evidence that these effects are seen in humans (<LINK REF="REF-de-Vries-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">de Vries 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>Both artemotil and alpha/beta arteether are given intramuscularly and can be given once daily because of their longer elimination half life (<LINK REF="REF-de-Vries-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">de Vries 1996</LINK>). They have similar efficacy and clinical safety profiles (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2002</LINK>). The only differences in their formulations are that artemotil contains the beta form and is dissolved in sesame oil (<LINK REF="REF-Lugt-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lugt 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2002</LINK>), whereas alpha/beta arteether contains both alpha and beta forms and is dissolved in groundnut oil (<LINK REF="STD-Mohanty-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Mohanty 1997</LINK>). </P>
<P>Arteether is a potential substitute for quinine because of drug resistance and safety issues seen with quinine. It may also be more effective than other artemisinin derivatives because of its oil solubility, longer half life, and increased chemical stability. We have therefore summarized the available evidence on the two forms of arteether used to treat severe malaria.</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>This review was designed to assess the efficacy and safety of arteether for treating severe malaria. Two small trials in Africa involving 194 children with cerebral malaria met the inclusion criteria. </P>
<P>Both trials had similar inclusion criteria, used the same dose and route of administration of arteether and quinine (control), and reported on similar outcome measures. The total number of trials and participants were small, which means that the meta-analyses lack power to detect any statistically significant differences between arteether and quinine. From the results, there was insufficient evidence to suggest that arteether reduces deaths, neurological complications, or any of the other measured outcomes compared to quinine. </P>
<P>Both trials adequately generated the allocation sequence and concealed allocation. The participants and the assessors did not appear to have been blinded in either study. As arteether was given intramuscularly and quinine was given intravenously, this may have been technically difficult. Also, with a primary outcome such as death, the anticipated gain in reduction of bias from blinding may not be worth the difficulty or cost (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1996</LINK>). However blinding of other assessments is often advisable (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1996</LINK>), but only <LINK REF="STD-Thuma-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Thuma 2000</LINK> used single blinding for measuring parasite clearance time and the presence of parasites. There have been a number of trials with other artemisinin derivatives, mainly artemether. Trials are expensive, and if further large-scale trials are to be done with either artemotil or alpha/beta arteether, there needs to be a strong argument to justify the scientific rationale.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>The data on the comparative effects of arteether and quinine are too limited to determine the effects of arteether on death, neurological complications at follow up, time to regain consciousness, parasite clearance time, presence of parasites on days 7 and 28, fever clearance time, and adverse events. However, the evidence reviewed did not suggest that arteether is any worse than quinine for treating severe malaria in children.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>More trials that compare arteether with other antimalarial drugs in children and adults that have sufficient statistical power to detect clinically significant differences in the number of deaths and other important outcomes are needed. It is also important for subsequent trials to improve (for example, blinding of outcome assessments) and report all aspects of their methodological quality, and report all their outcomes, including adverse events and neurological complications, in greater detail.</P>
