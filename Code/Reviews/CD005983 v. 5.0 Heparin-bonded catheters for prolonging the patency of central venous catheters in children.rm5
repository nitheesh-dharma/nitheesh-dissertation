<TITLE>Heparin-bonded catheters for prolonging the patency of central venous catheters in children</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2014-02-21 09:36:19 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>Central venous catheters are used for prolonged intravenous therapy in the management of critically ill children, for parenteral nutrition, medication and monitoring. Having these catheters in place can cause blood clots in or around the end of the catheter as well as infection, either local or a blood stream infection. As a result, the catheter becomes blocked, eventually to the point that it is occluded and can no longer be used to give fluids. Anticoagulant drugs such as heparin can be given to prolong the usefulness of the catheter or the catheters can be coated with heparin (heparin-bonded catheters). Heparin can cause side effects such as bleeding, allergic reactions, induced thrombocytopenia (an abnormal drop in the number of platelets in the blood) and osteoporosis with long-term use.</P>
<P>The review authors identified two good quality controlled trials that randomized 287 children aged one day to 16 years to either a heparin-bonded catheter or a standard catheter. The median duration of time that the catheter could be used to give fluids (its patency) was not clearly different with the two types of catheter. This was seven days in the heparin-bonded catheter group and six days in the standard catheter group. There was a no difference between the two groups for risk of catheter-related thrombosis over the time the catheter was in. There was a trend towards a reduction in the risk of catheter occlusion in the first week after catheter placement, reported in one study only.</P>
<P>The risks of catheter-related blood stream infections and bacterial colonization of the catheter were significantly reduced using the heparin-bonded catheter, with a longer time to develop infection (delayed in the heparin-bonded catheter group); however, it was reported in one study only and the strength of evidence was low. There was no significant difference in risk of thrombocytopenia after catheter placement.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2013-08-11 17:20:04 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>Central venous catheters (CVCs) are a mainstay in the management of critically ill children. However, these catheters are associated with mechanical and infectious complications which reduce their life span. Heparin bonding of catheters has shown promise in animal studies and in adults. This is the first update of a review published in 2007.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2014-02-21 09:16:40 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>The primary objective was to determine the effect of heparin-bonded CVCs on the duration of catheter patency in children. Secondary objectives were to determine the effects of heparin-bonded catheters on catheter-related thrombosis, occlusion, blood stream infection and side effects.</P>

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2014-02-21 09:17:41 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Heather  Maxwell">
<P>For this update<I> </I>the Cochrane Peripheral Vascular Diseases Group Trials Search Co-ordinator searched the Specialised Register (last searched August 2013) and CENTRAL (2013, Issue 7). The authors searched MEDLINE (1946 to week 3 August 2013).</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2014-02-21 09:18:30 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>We included randomized and quasi-randomized controlled trials of heparin-bonded catheters versus non-heparin bonded catheters or antibiotic-impregnated catheters that reported on any of the prespecified outcomes, without language restriction.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2014-02-21 09:19:59 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Heather  Maxwell">
<P>We assessed the methodological quality of the trials using the information provided in the studies and by contacting authors. We extracted data and estimated the effect size reported as risk ratio (RR), risk difference (RD) or number needed to treat (NNT), as appropriate.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-02-21 09:20:35 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>We included two eligible studies with a total of 287 participants; both had good methodological quality. There was no difference in the duration of catheter patency between heparin-bonded and non-heparin bonded catheters (median duration seven days versus six days) reported in one study. There was no difference in the risk of catheter-related thrombosis (two studies, RR 0.34, 95% CI 0.01 to 7.68; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 80%; RD -0.06, 95% CI -0.17 to 0.06). Data from one study revealed a statistically significant reduction in the risk of catheter occlusion (RR 0.06, 95% CI 0.00 to 1.07; RD -0.08, 95% CI -0.13 to -0.02; NNT 13, 95% CI 8 to 50), catheter-related blood stream infections (RR 0.06, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.41; RD -0.17, 95% CI -0.25 to -0.10; NNT 6, 95% CI 4 to 10) and catheter colonization (RR 0.21, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.71; RD -0.11, 95% CI -0.19 to -0.04; NNT 9, 95% CI 5 to 25) in the heparin-bonded catheter group. The second study did not report on these outcomes. There was no significant difference in risk of thrombocytopenia after catheter placement (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.38 to 1.39; RD -0.02, 95% CI -0.10 to 0.07).</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2014-02-21 09:26:36 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two eligible studies on the use of heparin-bonded catheters versus placebo in children were identified. Meta-analysis of the two studies revealed no reduction in catheter-related thrombosis with heparin-bonded catheters. One study reported a reduction in catheter-related blood stream infection and colonization following the use of heparin-bonded catheters. The strength of evidence is low and further well-designed multicenter randomized controlled trials are warranted.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2014-02-21 09:38:43 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Central venous catheters (CVCs) are important for the management of prolonged intravenous therapy in children who need parenteral nutrition, medication or hemodynamic monitoring (<LINK REF="REF-Klerk-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Klerk 2003</LINK>). However, these catheters are associated with mechanical and infectious complications. Mechanical complications include thrombosis (clotting) (<LINK REF="REF-Andrew-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Andrew 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Massicotte-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Massicotte 1998</LINK>), extravasation (leakage of blood or lymph, intravenous drugs, or intravenous nutrition from a vein into the surrounding tissue), occlusion (blockage) and dislodgement of the catheter. The incidence of CVC-related thrombosis is reported to be 10% to 26% (<LINK REF="REF-Beck-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beck 1998</LINK>) or 3.5 per 10,000 pediatric admissions (<LINK REF="REF-Massicotte-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Massicotte 1998</LINK>) and is higher in patients with malignancy. Several factors have been implicated in the causation of thrombosis. These include patient characteristics, for example younger age, and infusion-related characteristics such as low flow states, rate of infusion (<LINK REF="REF-Beck-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beck 1998</LINK>), site of catheter placement (<LINK REF="REF-Massicotte-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Massicotte 1998</LINK>) and duration of catheter placement. Infections can be caused by bacteria or fungi. Additionally, thromboses can also act as a nidus (breeding ground) for infection (<LINK REF="REF-Timsit-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Timsit 1998</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2014-02-21 09:44:46 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Several measures have been employed to prevent CVC-related thrombosis. These include anticoagulants such as unfractionated heparin at prophylactic or therapeutic dosages (<LINK REF="REF-Abdelkefi-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Abdelkefi 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bailey-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bailey 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Brismar-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brismar 1982</LINK>); low molecular weight heparins (for example dalteparin); warfarin; heparin-bonded catheters; infusion of nitroglycerin (<LINK REF="REF-Jacobs-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jacobs 2001</LINK>); and vitamin C (<LINK REF="REF-Rabe-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rabe 2002</LINK>). In a systematic review of six studies on the prophylactic or therapeutic use of heparin flushes or antithrombotic agents in adults, Klerk (<LINK REF="REF-Klerk-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Klerk 2003</LINK>) concluded that the addition of heparin to parenteral fluids did not reduce the incidence of CVC-related thrombosis. In a randomized controlled trial of 152 children, heparinization was found to reduce the risk for non-patency of arterial catheters but not for CVCs (<LINK REF="REF-de-Neef-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">de Neef 2002</LINK>). However, another meta-analysis of 11 studies of heparin infusion or heparin bonding for CVCs reported a reduction of CVC-related venous thrombosis (risk ratio 0.43, 95% confidence interval 0.23 to 0.78) with prophylactic heparinization (<LINK REF="REF-Randolph-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Randolph 1998</LINK>). A review of the effectiveness of antibiotic-impregnated and heparin-bonded catheters in preventing infections reported a significant reduction in the incidence of infections. However, only one study of heparin-bonded catheters was included in this review (<LINK REF="REF-Marin-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marin 2000</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Carrasco-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Carrasco 2004</LINK> compared heparin-coated catheters with chlorhexidine and silver sulfadiazine-coated CVCs in adult intensive care units and reported reduced colonization by gram-positive cocci and <I>Candida</I> species in the latter group.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2014-02-21 09:48:35 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Thrombosis has been observed within 24 hours of placement of intravenous catheters and by 72 hours thrombi started to detach (<LINK REF="REF-Hofbauer-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hofbauer 2000</LINK>). Bonding of the catheter surface with heparin benzalkonium has been shown to reduce thrombogenicity and thrombophlebitis in rabbits by reducing damage to the intima (the inner layer of a blood vessel) and by reducing platelet aggregation (<LINK REF="REF-Di-Costanzo-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Di Costanzo 1984</LINK>). Heparin bonding of catheters, in which heparin is impregnated and thus slowly released on a continuous basis, should be differentiated from heparin flushes which involve intermittent infusion of heparin alongside other infusates. Heparinization has also been shown to reduce adherence by coagulase negative <I>Staphylococcus aureus</I> when compared with catheters without heparinization (<LINK REF="STD-Appelgren-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Appelgren 1996</LINK>). Heparin coating was believed to reduce fibronectin adhesion (a substance that interacts with extracellular substances such as fibrin) on catheters and thereby reduce bacterial attachment (<LINK REF="STD-Appelgren-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Appelgren 1996</LINK>).</P>

<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2013-08-11 17:31:34 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P> <LINK REF="STD-Bennegard-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Bennegard 1982</LINK> demonstrated an increased incidence of thrombophlebitis in the first four days after catheterization in heparin-coated polyethylene catheters with no reduction in the incidence of thrombotic complications. <LINK REF="REF-Mollenholt-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mollenholt 1987</LINK> cautioned against overestimation of the protective effects of heparin bonding of pulmonary arterial catheters because effectiveness was found to decrease with time. Additionally, heparin is associated with side effects such as bleeding, allergic reactions and heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) (<LINK REF="REF-Warkentin-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Warkentin 1990</LINK>). These side effects could be aggravated in critically ill children if they have other intravascular devices in place or are receiving additional heparin. It is important to do this review in order to assess the effectiveness and safety of heparin-bonded CVCs in children.</P>

<P>For this review update an additional publication was identified for the <LINK REF="STD-Anton-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Anton 2009</LINK> study which had previously been included as an abstract only. In this update the full publication was included.</P>
<P>In total, two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Anton-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Anton 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pierce-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Pierce 2000</LINK>) were included in this review.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Anton-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Anton 2009</LINK> was a single center study. A total of 97 participants were randomized but 87 participants completed the study. A total of 10 participants (five in each arm) were lost to the final analysis due to either not receiving the study intervention or being unable to obtain final imaging for diagnosis. Children less than one year of age with congenital heart disease who required a short-term central venous line for standard clinical care were randomized to receive either a heparin-bonded catheter or non-heparin bonded catheter. The catheters were identical in appearance. Randomization was held at the company, which manufactured identical catheters, to preserve blinding. The primary outcome of the study was the incidence of symptomatic and silent CVL-associated venous thromboembolism, assessed by prespecified criteria. Clinical thrombosis was defined as swelling of the affected limb, discoloration or tenderness, or an inability to draw back or flush the CVL after the use of alteplase to flush the catheter. An ultrasound was performed in all participants if they were symptomatic or within 48 hours of removal of the catheter in asymptomatic infants. If the ultrasound was positive, the participant was confirmed positive for the thrombosis outcome. If the ultrasound was negative, the participant underwent venography. All ultrasounds were reviewed by a blinded central adjudication committee. Of 97 randomized participants, 53 were allocated to the non-heparin bonded catheter group (of whom 52 received the intervention as one participant did not receive a catheter) and 44 were randomized to the heparin-bonded catheter group (of whom 42 received the intervention as two participants did not receive a catheter). Four participants in the non-heparin bonded catheter and three participants in the heparin-bonded catheter group were lost to follow up as they did not have ultrasound assessment as planned. Thus, 47 participants in the non-heparin bonded catheter group and 40 in the heparin-bonded catheter group were analysed. After enrollment of these children, the first batch of blinded catheters reached their expiration date. Before producing another batch, the steering committee evaluated (blinded) the outcomes of 87 participants. Based on the results of the analyses, the steering committee stopped the trial based on futility as there was strong evidence against the presumed 50% reduction in thrombosis.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Pierce-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Pierce 2000</LINK> was a single center study. A total of 209 participants between the ages of one day and 16 years were randomized to either heparin-bonded catheters or non-heparin bonded catheters. The authors reported that at the end of the study data were available for 97 participants randomized to heparin-bonded catheters and 103 participants randomized to non-heparin bonded catheters for the analyses. Both types of catheter were made from polyurethane. The catheters were either size 4F in diameter; double or triple lumen; and 5 cm, 8 cm or 15 cm in length. The catheters had similar appearance and construction. The decision to remove a catheter was made by the attending team. All participants had color Doppler ultrasound examination within three days of insertion of the catheter and then every three days until the removal of the catheter. Thrombosis was defined as the presence of an echogenic mass within the lumen disrupting the blood flow. The radiologist reviewing the ultrasonography was unaware of the treatment allocation. All participants had blood cultures taken from the CVC and another site on insertion of the catheter and then every three days until the removal of the catheter. Additional blood cultures were obtained when clinically indicated. Infections were considered significant when the same organism was grown from two sets of cultures from two different sites and the organism was different from the one isolated at the start of catheter placement. Catheter-related blood stream infections were considered when the same organism was isolated from two sets of cultures from two separate sites. The microbiologist reporting infection was unaware of treatment allocation.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-02-21 11:38:45 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>After an extensive literature review only two studies which have evaluated this intervention were identified (<LINK REF="STD-Anton-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Anton 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pierce-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Pierce 2000</LINK>). Both studies were well-conducted single center studies with adequate methodological quality. The primary outcome of this review, duration of catheter patency, was only evaluated in a single study that showed no difference in median duration of catheter patency. <LINK REF="STD-Pierce-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Pierce 2000</LINK> reported a trend towards a reduction in the risk of catheter-related thrombosis and risk of catheter occlusion in the heparin-bonded catheter group whereas <LINK REF="STD-Anton-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Anton 2009</LINK> reported no significant difference in the risk of catheter-related thrombosis. There was a significant reduction in the risks of catheter-related infection and catheter colonization in the study by <LINK REF="STD-Pierce-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Pierce 2000</LINK>. The incidence of catheter occlusion was reduced in the heparin-bonded catheter group within the first week of catheter placement according to <LINK REF="STD-Pierce-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Pierce 2000</LINK>. There was no increase in the risk of thrombocytopenia associated with the use of heparin-bonded catheters; however, no systematic attempts were made for evaluation of side effects in either study. This leads to inconclusive information regarding toxic effects or lack thereof.</P>

<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2014-02-21 11:38:16 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We have searched extensively to identify, select and appraise studies for inclusion in this review. Overall completeness of the results in this review is quite satisfactory based on the information available to date. Contact with both study authors led to additional information from <LINK REF="STD-Pierce-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Pierce 2000</LINK> but not from <LINK REF="STD-Anton-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Anton 2009</LINK>.</P>
<P>A major difference in the clinical characteristics of the two included studies is the study population. <LINK REF="STD-Pierce-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Pierce 2000</LINK> enrolled newborn infants irrespective of diagnosis while <LINK REF="STD-Anton-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Anton 2009</LINK> only enrolled a high-risk group of children with congenital heart disease. Presence of congenital heart disease is in itself a predisposing factor for vascular thrombosis, second to polycythemia associated with cyanotic heart disease. A slower, altered circulatory state and increased likelihood of undergoing surgery are observed in this group of infants, increasing the probability of thrombosis. <LINK REF="STD-Anton-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Anton 2009</LINK> appears to be a negative result study whereas <LINK REF="STD-Pierce-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Pierce 2000</LINK> reports positive results as far as the efficacy of heparin-bonded catheters in preventing vascular thrombosis and its associated complications are concerned. These studies reflect a fair amount of clinical and statistical heterogeneity.</P>

An animal study (<LINK REF="REF-Di-Costanzo-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Di Costanzo 1984</LINK>) showed that heparin-benzalkonium bonded silicone catheters provided protection against thrombophlebitis due to less damage to the intima and slowed aggregation of platelets. <LINK REF="REF-Nichols-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nichols 1984</LINK> revealed that heparin-bonded catheters prevented catheter-induced platelet alpha granule release and fibrin formation on the catheter surfaces, which thus may prevent thrombus formation.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Gilbert-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gilbert 2003</LINK> reported that, despite the study by <LINK REF="STD-Pierce-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Pierce 2000</LINK>, the use of heparin-bonded catheters is not prevalent in the UK due to licensing issues. Only the center where the study was conducted is using these types of catheters with full legal responsibility and on a named-patient basis.</P>
<P>Due to variability in the results, the findings of the studies by <LINK REF="STD-Anton-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Anton 2009</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Pierce-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Pierce 2000</LINK> need to be confirmed in other studies before specific recommendations can be made. Exposure to inadvertent use of heparin for pediatric patients needs to be studied carefully, especially with emerging reports of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and associated thrombosis in adult and pediatric patients (<LINK REF="REF-Schmugge-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schmugge 2002</LINK>). Exposure at this early age may lead to sensitization and could render an individual prone to further complications in later life. There was no difference in the duration of catheter patency in these studies, which is usually the effect seen with heparin. The authors have not documented the clinically important and significant outcome of mortality. Further multicenter evaluation of heparin-bonded catheters is warranted.</P>

<P>Heparin-bonded central venous catheters in pediatric patients reduced catheter-related infections and colonizations. However, the strength of evidence is low as it comes from only one study. There was no statistically significant difference in catheter-related thrombosis or duration of catheter patency. Currently available data are inconclusive and further research is needed to establish the safety and efficacy of prolonged exposure to heparin. Additionally, there are questions regarding how much heparin should be included in bonding, especially for catheters to be used in at-risk children.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2014-02-25 08:21:08 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>Further research in the form of a randomized controlled trial, preferably a multicenter study, is needed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of heparin-bonded central venous catheters. This study should only include one catheter per patient; report on the duration of catheter patency among censored (catheters removed due to complications) and non-censored (catheters removed electively) observations (mean, SD, median, range), catheter-related infection, occlusion, catheter-related thrombosis; and the incidence of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, hemorrhage, allergic reactions, thrombophlebitis and overall all-cause mortality prior to discharge. Additionally, the exact dose of heparin and catheter material to be used for such catheters in a pediatric population also warrants further studies. Applicability of the information obtained in the adult population to the pediatric population will also need further studies.</P>
