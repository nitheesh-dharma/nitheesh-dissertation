<P>There is not enough evidence available to determine if acupuncture, maternal massage, bright light therapy, or omega-3 fatty acids are effective interventions in treating antenatal depression.</P>
<P>Approximately 12% of women will suffer from depression during their pregnancy. Research suggests that women who experience significant stress, have a history of depression, lack social support, have a history of domestic violence, are not married and living alone, and have an unintended pregnancy or poor relationships may be at a higher risk than other women of developing antenatal depression. Symptoms can include overwhelming feelings of sadness and grief, loss of interest or pleasure in activities that are usually enjoyed, feelings of worthlessness or guilt, poor sleep, a change in appetite, severe fatigue and difficulty concentrating. Unfortunately, depression during pregnancy is related to poor maternal self-care behaviours, which may influence the baby's health; it also places a woman at significant risk of developing postpartum depression. Many women prefer not to take medication during their pregnancy and they are often interested in other complementary forms of treatment. The review found only six randomised controlled trials involving 402 women evaluating depression-specific acupuncture (the insertion of needles into the superficial body tissues for remedial purposes), maternal massage, bright light therapy, and omega-3 fatty acids for the treatment of antenatal depression. The included trials were too small to reach any conclusions; they also used a variety of interventions, outcome measures and comparisons. The trials provided insufficient evidence to determine if these therapies are effective treatments for antenatal depression. Further research is needed.</P>

<P>Six trials were included involving 402 women from the United States, Switzerland, and Taiwan. For most comparisons a single trial contributed data and there were few statistically significant differences between control and intervention groups.</P>
<P>In a trial with 38 women maternal massage compared with non-specific acupuncture (control group) did not significantly decrease the number of women with clinical depression or depressive symptomatology immediately post-treatment (risk ratio (RR) 0.80, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.25 to 2.53; mean difference (MD) -2.30, 95% CI -6.51 to 1.91 respectively). In another trial with 88 women there was no difference in treatment response or depression remission rates in women receiving maternal massage compared with those receiving non-specific acupuncture (RR 1.33, 95% CI 0.82 to 2.18; RR 1.14, 95% CI 0.59 to 2.19 respectively).</P>
<P>In a trial with 35 women acupuncture specifically treating symptoms of depression, compared with non-specific acupuncture, did not significantly decrease the number of women with clinical depression or depressive symptomatology immediately post-treatment (RR 0.47, 95% CI 0.11 to 2.13; MD -3.00, 95% CI -8.10 to 2.10). However, women who received depression-specific acupuncture were more likely to respond to treatment compared with those receiving non-specific acupuncture (RR 1.68, 95% CI 1.06 to 2.66).</P>
<P>In a trial with 149 women, maternal massage by a woman's significant other, compared with standard care, significantly decreased the number of women with depressive symptomatology immediately post-treatment (MD -6.70, 95% CI -9.77 to -3.63).<BR/>
<BR/>Further, women receiving bright light therapy had a significantly greater change in their mean depression scores over the five weeks of treatment than those receiving a dim light placebo (one trial, n = 27; MD -4.80, 95% CI -8.39 to -1.21). However, they were not more likely to have a treatment response or experience a higher remission rate (RR 1.79, 95% CI 0.90 to 3.56; RR 1.89, 95% CI 0.81 to 4.42).</P>
<P>Lastly, two trials examined the treatment effect of omega-3 oils. Women receiving omega-3 had a significantly lower mean depression score following eight weeks of treatment than those receiving a placebo (one trial, n = 33; MD -4.70, 95% CI -7.82 to -1.58). Conversely, in a smaller trial (21 women) there was no significant difference in the change in mean depression scores for women receiving omega-3 and those receiving a placebo (MD 0.36, 95% CI -0.17 to 0.89), and women who received omega-3 were no more likely to respond to treatment (RR 2.26, 95% CI 0.78 to 6.49) or have higher remission rates (RR 2.12, 95% CI 0.51 to 8.84). Women in the placebo group were just as likely to report a side effect as those in the omega-3 group (RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.56 to 2.27).</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2013-07-14 15:30:31 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Depression is a common complication in pregnancy, exceeding rates in the general female population. A meta-analysis of 21 studies suggests that the mean prevalence rate of depression across the antenatal period is 10.7%, ranging from 7.4% in the first trimester to a high of 12.8% in the second trimester (<LINK REF="REF-Bennett-2004a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bennett 2004a</LINK>). An earlier meta-analysis including 59 studies also found that depression was common during pregnancy with a period prevalence of 18.4% across the nine months of pregnancy, with 12.7% having an episode of major depression during this time. Not surprisingly, antenatal depression is a strong risk factor of postpartum depression, and this review identified an overall prevalence of 13% within the first 12 weeks following childbirth (n = 12,810; 95% confidence interval 12.3% to 13.4%) (<LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Hara-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Hara 1996</LINK>). Symptoms may include overwhelming feelings of sadness and grief, loss of interest or pleasure in activities usually enjoyed, feelings of worthlessness or guilt, poor sleep, a change in appetite, severe fatigue and difficulty concentrating. Numerous studies of variable methodological quality have examined antenatal depression risk factors. A systematic review that included 57 studies found the following variables were associated with a greater likelihood of antepartum depressive symptoms: anxiety in pregnancy, increased life stress, history of depression, lack of social support including intimate partner support, history of domestic violence, unintended pregnancy, single/non-cohabitation status, and poor intimate relationship quality (<LINK REF="REF-Lancaster-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lancaster 2010</LINK>). However, inconsistent findings were found related to smoking, alcohol use, illicit drug use, parity, maternal race/ethnicity, and maternal age. Five studies assessed measures of socioeconomic status and no significant associations were found. Inconsistent results were found for three sub-components of socioeconomic status: income, employment, and education. Unfortunately, there is a general lack of awareness about antenatal depression in the community (<LINK REF="REF-Highet-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Highet 2011</LINK>), which may partially explain why it often remains under-diagnosed (<LINK REF="REF-Flynn-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Flynn 2006</LINK>). As it is an important public health issue, several professional organisations now recommend routine screening for antepartum depression to improve detection and treatment rates (<LINK REF="REF-ACOG-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">ACOG 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NCCMH-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">NCCMH 2007</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2013-07-14 15:30:47 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Decisions about how to treat depression in pregnancy are complex. While untreated depression poses risk to mothers and fetuses, no treatment option comes without disadvantages. Pharmacotherapy such as anti-depressant medication is a common treatment for moderate to severe depression that has well-demonstrated efficacy (<LINK REF="REF-Lam-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lam 2009</LINK>). However, information on the safety of anti-depressant medication in pregnancy comes from observational studies which cannot rule out long-term risks of fetal exposure. As a potential adjunct or alternative to anti-depressant medication, psychotherapy such as cognitive-behavioural therapy and interpersonal psychotherapy have been validated as effective treatment for general depression (<LINK REF="REF-Parikh-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parikh 2009</LINK>). A Cochrane systematic review has been completed evaluating these psychotherapies and psychosocial interventions (e.g., peer support, non-directive counselling, nurse/midwifery home visits) for the treatment of postpartum depression (<LINK REF="REF-Dennis-2007a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dennis 2007a</LINK>). A Cochrane systematic review of psychosocial and psychological interventions for the treatment of antenatal depression has also been completed (<LINK REF="REF-Dennis-2007b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dennis 2007b</LINK>) where only one trial was included in the review (<LINK REF="REF-Spinelli-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spinelli 2003</LINK>). However, psychotherapy may take 12 weeks or more to take effect and it may not be effective on its own in women with more severe illness (<LINK REF="REF-Yonkers-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yonkers 2009</LINK>). Further, access to psychotherapy may be limited especially for those in rural and remote areas. Interventions other than pharmacological, psychosocial or psychological are also available for the treatment of depression. These "alternative" treatment options, such as light therapy and herbal supplements, are commonly used in part because of a prevalent belief that &#8220;natural is better&#8221; (<LINK REF="REF-Ravindran-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ravindran 2009</LINK>). There is some reason to support the use of these therapies as a survey of primary care patients found about 11% of people with depression and anxiety reported using complementary or alternative medicine therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Roy_x002d_Byrne-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roy-Byrne 2005</LINK>), a rate similar to the proportion of people with depression who use anti-depressant medication (<LINK REF="REF-Mojtabai-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mojtabai 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>There are several alternative treatment options available for depression including physical therapies (for example, bright light therapy, physical exercise, yoga, acupuncture, sleep deprivation), nutraceuticals (for example, omega-3 fatty acids), and herbal remedies (for example, St. John's Wort) (<LINK REF="REF-Ravindran-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ravindran 2009</LINK>). Light therapy is exposure to bright light where the standard &#8220;dose&#8221; is 10,000 lux (intensity) with a fluorescent light box for 30 minutes per day given in the early morning usually at home. Response typically occurs within three weeks. While the mechanism of action is still unclear, correction of disturbed circadian rhythms and modulation of serotonin and catecholamine systems are two of the theories proposed (<LINK REF="REF-Crowley-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Crowley 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sohn-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sohn 2005</LINK>). Another treatment option is some form of physical exercise over eight to 20 weeks (average of 12 weeks), usually three times a week for 30 to 60 minutes per session. Along a similar line is yoga, which integrates physical postures, breath control, and meditation. It is practiced typically between four to eight weeks, with an average frequency of four times a week for 45 to 60 minutes per session (<LINK REF="REF-Ravindran-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ravindran 2009</LINK>). Acupuncture uses special needles to pierce the skin surface at specific body points to produce particular therapeutic effects. Treatment is often four to eight weeks and the number of needles (two to 16) and sessions varies widely.</P>
<P>Nutraceuticals are nonprescription natural health products that are usually in concentrated forms of naturally occurring substances such as vitamins and minerals (e.g., omega-3 fatty acids, tryptophan, S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM-e), folic acid, inositol, amino acids, alpha-lactabumin, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), and acetyl-L-carnitine) (<LINK REF="REF-Ravindran-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ravindran 2009</LINK>). They are used alone or in combination to promote general well-being. Common nutraceuticals are omega-3 fatty acids, polyunsaturated fatty acids found in multiple biological systems. While the mechanisms of action are not fully understood, omega-3 fatty acids have been studied in different doses and formulations, which include estyl esters of eicosapentanoic acid (EPA) or docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) or a combination of both (<LINK REF="REF-Freeman-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Freeman 2011</LINK>). Herbal remedies are another sub-category of natural health products that are derived from plants and plant extracts, such as leaves, flowers, roots, bark and berries, and sold as a non-prescription product (<LINK REF="REF-Ravindran-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ravindran 2009</LINK>). This category includes St. John's wort, <I>Crocus sativus</I>, <I>Lavandula angustifolia</I>, <I>Rhodiola rosea</I>, and <I>Gingko biloba</I> to name a few.</P>

<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2013-07-14 15:30:55 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Untreated (or incompletely managed) antenatal depression has been associated with a range of adverse pregnancy complications (<LINK REF="REF-Bonari-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bonari 2004</LINK>), such as pre-eclampsia (<LINK REF="REF-Kurki-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kurki 2000</LINK>), preterm labour (<LINK REF="REF-Dayan-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dayan 2002</LINK>), and prolonged labour (<LINK REF="REF-Hanlon-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hanlon 2009</LINK>). Previous research has also demonstrated an association between mental illness and maternal smoking (<LINK REF="REF-Zhu-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhu 2002</LINK>), abnormal endocrine and immune regulation (<LINK REF="REF-Clark-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clark 1996</LINK>) which may impair fetal development and lead to low birthweight (<LINK REF="REF-Rondo-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rondo 2003</LINK>). There is also rapidly growing evidence that antenatal depression may impact child development (for example, <LINK REF="REF-Evans-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Evans 2012</LINK>). In addition, depression during pregnancy is one of the strongest risk factors for postpartum depression (<LINK REF="REF-Beck-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beck 2001</LINK>), another well documented condition with significant research demonstrating a negative effect on infant and child developmental trajectories. Due to the limited amount of research evaluating the effectiveness of psychological and psychosocial interventions for the treatment of antenatal depression (<LINK REF="REF-Dennis-2007b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dennis 2007b</LINK>) and the unknown risks of pharmacotherapy, alternative forms of treatment that have been evaluated for general depression should be examined. This review examined the effectiveness of these non-pharmacological/psychosocial/psychological interventions in the treatment of antenatal depression, where treatment is defined as any intervention initiated among pregnant women who have been identified with depressive symptomatology (using a self-report measure) or diagnosed with depression (using a clinical interview).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">(2) Allocation concealment (checking for possible selection bias)</HEADING>
<P>We have described for each included study the method used to conceal the allocation sequence and have determined whether intervention allocation could have been foreseen in advance of, or during recruitment, or changed after assignment.</P>
<P>We assessed the methods as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>low risk of bias (e.g. telephone or central randomisation; consecutively numbered sealed opaque envelopes);</LI>

<P>We have described for each included study how we investigated the possibility of selective outcome reporting bias and what we found.</P>
<P>We assessed the methods as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>low risk of bias (where it is clear that all of the study&#8217;s pre-specified outcomes and all expected outcomes of interest to the review have been reported);</LI>
<LI>high risk of bias (where not all the study&#8217;s pre-specified outcomes have been reported; one or more reported primary outcomes were not pre-specified; outcomes of interest are reported incompletely and so cannot be used; study fails to include results of a key outcome that would have been expected to have been reported);</LI>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Cluster-randomised trials</HEADING>
<P>We planned to include cluster-randomised trials in the analyses along with individually-randomised trials. In this version of the review we did not identify any cluster-randomised trials, however, if such trials are included in future updates, we will adjust their<I> </I>sample sizes using the methods described in the <I>Cochrane Handbook</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>) using an estimate of the intracluster correlation co-efficient (ICC) derived from the trial (if possible), from a similar trial or from a study of a similar population. If we use ICCs from other sources, we will report this and conduct sensitivity analyses to investigate the effect of variation in the ICC. If we identify both cluster-randomised trials and individually-randomised trials, we plan to synthesise the relevant information. We will consider it reasonable to combine the results from both if there is little heterogeneity between the study designs and the interaction between the effect of intervention and the choice of randomisation unit is considered to be unlikely.</P>

<P>For included studies, we noted levels of attrition. We explored the impact of including studies with high levels of missing data in the overall assessment of treatment effect by using sensitivity analysis.</P>
<P>For all outcomes, we carried out analyses, as far as possible, on an intention-to-treat basis, i.e. we attempted to include all participants randomised to each group in the analyses, and all participants were analysed in the group to which they were allocated, regardless of whether or not they received the allocated intervention. The denominator for each outcome in each trial was the number randomised minus any participants whose outcomes were known to be missing.</P>

<DATA_SYNTHESIS MODIFIED="2013-07-14 15:34:31 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jill V Hampson">
<P>We carried out statistical analysis using the Review Manager software (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2012</LINK>). We used fixed-effect meta-analysis for combining data where it was reasonable to assume that studies were estimating the same underlying treatment effect: i.e. where trials examined the same intervention, and the trials&#8217; populations and methods were judged sufficiently similar. If there was clinical heterogeneity sufficient to expect that the underlying treatment effects would differ between trials, or if substantial statistical heterogeneity was detected, we planned to use random-effects meta-analysis to produce an overall summary, if an average treatment effect across trials was considered clinically meaningful. The random-effects summary would have been treated as the average range of possible treatment effects and we would have discussed the clinical implications of treatment effects differing between trials. If the average treatment effect was not considered to be clinically meaningful, we would not combine trials.</P>
<P>If we had used random-effects analyses, the results would have been presented as the average treatment effect with its 95% confidence interval, and the estimates of  T<SUP>2</SUP> and I<SUP>2</SUP>.</P>

<P>Six randomised controlled trials, reported between 2004 and 2011, were identified and met the inclusion criteria (<LINK REF="STD-Field-2009a" TYPE="STUDY">Field 2009a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Freeman-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Freeman 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Manber-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Manber 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Manber-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Manber 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Su-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Su 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wirz_x002d_Justice-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Wirz-Justice 2011</LINK>). In total, 402 women were included in the meta-analysis. Of the six trials, four were conducted in the United States (<LINK REF="STD-Field-2009a" TYPE="STUDY">Field 2009a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Freeman-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Freeman 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Manber-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Manber 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Manber-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Manber 2010</LINK>) while the other two trials were conducted in Switerland (<LINK REF="STD-Wirz_x002d_Justice-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Wirz-Justice 2011</LINK>) and Taiwan (<LINK REF="STD-Su-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Su 2008</LINK>).

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Definition of depression</HEADING>
<P>A diagnosis of depression is made by a clinician following examination and clinical assessment; most of the studies included in the review did not report the number of women diagnosed with depression, but instead reported scores on various scales measuring symptoms of depression such as low mood or suicidal ideation (depressive symptomatology). In all trials, depressive symptomatology was assessed using a self-report measure; only one trial included a diagnosis of depression following clinical interview as an outcome (<LINK REF="STD-Manber-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Manber 2004</LINK>). The most common self-report measure used was the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD) (<LINK REF="STD-Freeman-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Freeman 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Manber-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Manber 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Manber-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Manber 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Su-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Su 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wirz_x002d_Justice-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Wirz-Justice 2011</LINK>). Two trials used the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) (<LINK REF="STD-Manber-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Manber 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Su-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Su 2008</LINK>) and two trials used the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) (<LINK REF="STD-Freeman-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Freeman 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Su-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Su 2008</LINK>). One trial incorporated the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) (<LINK REF="STD-Field-2009a" TYPE="STUDY">Field 2009a</LINK>) and one trial used the Structural Interview Guide for the Hamilton Depression and Anxiety Scales (SIGH-AD) (<LINK REF="STD-Wirz_x002d_Justice-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Wirz-Justice 2011</LINK>). Several trials examined a difference in mean scores (<LINK REF="STD-Field-2009a" TYPE="STUDY">Field 2009a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Manber-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Manber 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Su-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Su 2008</LINK>), while others examined a change in mean scores (<LINK REF="STD-Freeman-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Freeman 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wirz_x002d_Justice-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Wirz-Justice 2011</LINK>). Three trials examined both treatment response (defined in trials as a 50% reduction in baseline depressive symptomatology scores) and depression remission (defined in trials as a depressive symptomatology score below a specific cut-off indicating no symptoms of depression) (<LINK REF="STD-Manber-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Manber 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Su-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Su 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wirz_x002d_Justice-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Wirz-Justice 2011</LINK>). Due to the significant differences in the timing of outcome data, we included the outcome assessment point "immediately post-treatment antenatally".

While all trials reported depression or depressive symptomatology following treatment no trials reported on infant or family outcomes. While postpartum depression was one of our secondary outcomes, to avoid repetition in both the analyses and text, we have reported results for postpartum depression together with results for the antenatal period. For our primary outcomes, outcome measures for each individual treatment approach varied resulting in no data being combined in meta-analysis.</P>

<P>Six trials were included in this review incorporating 402 women from the United States, Switzerland, and Taiwan. The body of evidence provided in this review does not allow for a strong conclusion regarding non-pharmacological/psychosocial/psychological interventions for the treatment of antenatal depression. Only six trials were included and all treatment approaches had two or less trials providing evidence for effectiveness (acupuncture = two trials; massage = one trial; bright light therapy = one trial; omega-3 fatty acids = two trials). Outcome measures for each individual treatment approach varied resulting in no data being combined for the primary outcome. The methodological quality for most of the included trials was not strong with many common limitations such as unclear randomisation procedures, small and homogeneous samples, unclear blinding of outcome assessors, and high attrition rates. These limitations render any results questionable.</P>
<P>One three-armed trial tested the efficacy of maternal massage and depression-specific acupuncture for the treatment of depressed pregnant women (<LINK REF="STD-Manber-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Manber 2004</LINK>). This pilot study of 61 US women found that neither the 12 20-minute massage sessions nor the 12 25- to 30-minute depression specific-acupuncture sessions were more effective in reducing depressive symptoms than non-specific acupuncture. In a larger trial by the same group (<LINK REF="STD-Manber-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Manber 2010</LINK>), maternal massage sessions again were not more effective in achieving a significant treatment response or obtaining depression remission than non-specific acupuncture. However, this trial did find that depression-specific acupuncture was more likely to produce a treatment response than non-specific acupuncture; no effect was found related to depression remission. One trial evaluated the effect of maternal massage by a women's significant other versus standard care (<LINK REF="STD-Field-2009a" TYPE="STUDY">Field 2009a</LINK>). Women who received the massage where significantly more likely to experience a decrease in depressive symptomatology than those who received standard care; there was no impact on maternal anxiety. In a trial by <LINK REF="STD-Wirz_x002d_Justice-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Wirz-Justice 2011</LINK>, bright light therapy was not more effective than inactive bright light therapy in providing a treatment response or promoting depression remission. However, there was a significantly greater change in mean depression scores in those who received the active bright light therapy than those who received inactive therapy. While two trials evaluated omega-3 fatty acids for the treatment of antenatal depression, neither trial evaluated a similar outcome so their results could not be combined. In the trial by <LINK REF="STD-Su-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Su 2008</LINK>, women who received omega-3 fatty acids were not more likely to achieve depression remission or have a treatment response. However, in this trial women who received omega-3 fatty acids had significantly lower mean depressive symptoms scores following treatment than those receiving a placebo. In the trial by <LINK REF="STD-Freeman-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Freeman 2008</LINK>, there was no significant difference in the change in mean depression scores for women receiving omega-3 fatty acids and those receiving a placebo. In both trials, very few women reported a side effect and there was no differences in reporting an event between those who received omega-3 fatty acids and those who received a placebo.</P>

<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2013-07-14 15:38:35 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The treatment of antenatal depression using non-psychosocial/psychological interventions is an area that has been neglected, despite antenatal depression being a significant public health concern. This updated review added five new trials to the original review which only included one study (<LINK REF="STD-Manber-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Manber 2004</LINK>). The original trial in this review tested the efficacy of massage and depression-specific acupuncture for the treatment of depressed pregnant women. Another larger, acupuncture trial (n = 149) has been added by the same research group (<LINK REF="STD-Manber-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Manber 2010</LINK>). This trial found acupuncture specific for depression was associated with a significantly higher rate of response compared to control acupuncture (acupuncture not specific for depression). Several sample characteristics limit the generalisability of the results including the high education and socioeconomic status, predominance of Caucasians, and exclusion of comorbid mental and medical disorders. As such, the results are not generalisable to specific minority groups or pregnant women with other mental health concerns. While this trial alone does not provide strong evidence to indicate acupuncture should be used for the treatment of antenatal depression, the results are consistent with two other recent reviews that found acupuncture, including manual-, electrical-, and laser-based, is a generally beneficial, well-tolerated, and safe treatment for depression (<LINK REF="REF-Wang-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wang 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wu-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wu 2012</LINK>). The studies included in these reviews had many methodological limitations such as small sample size and unclear description of enrolment criteria, randomisation or blinding, and forms of acupuncture used. Recently, a randomised, subject- and assessor-blind, parallel-group, sham-controlled trial was conducted to evaluate the effect of acupuncture on postpartum depression among 20 Hong Kong mothers (<LINK REF="REF-Chung-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chung 2012</LINK>). Although this trial was generally well designed, no significant differences were found between the two groups. This negative finding may possibly be the result of a type II error as the study may have had insufficient power to detect differences between the study groups due to the small sample size. Despite consistent methodological limitations, there is growing evidence to suggest that acupuncture may be beneficial for the treatment of depression and large, well-designed randomised controlled trials are warranted to evaluate the effectiveness of acupuncture with depressed pregnant women.</P>
<P>Very few studies have been conducted to evaluate the effect of massage on the treatment of antenatal depression. The one trial included in this review that evaluated maternal massage compared with standard treatment care (<LINK REF="STD-Field-2009a" TYPE="STUDY">Field 2009a</LINK>) found women who received the massage intervention were significantly more like to experience a decreased depressive symptomatology. However, in this trial the massage intervention was provided by the woman's significant other. Given that a lack of support and a poor intimate partner relationship are significant risk factors for antenatal depression (<LINK REF="REF-Lancaster-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lancaster 2010</LINK>), the beneficial effect found in the trial may have been due to the additional attention provided by the women's significant other rather than the intervention itself. The other trial in this review that examined massage by a therapist versus non-specific acupuncture (control group) found no beneficial effect of massage (<LINK REF="STD-Manber-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Manber 2004</LINK>). In a recent systematic review of 17 randomised controlled trials of moderate quality, massage therapy was found to be effective in alleviating depressive symptoms (<LINK REF="REF-Hou-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hou 2010</LINK>). Additional research in this area is warranted; however, standardisation of massage therapy protocols are required to provide comparable results.</P>
<P>In this review, only one trial was included that evaluated the effect of bright light therapy (<LINK REF="STD-Wirz_x002d_Justice-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Wirz-Justice 2011</LINK>). While no beneficial effect on treatment response or depression remission was found, there was a significantly greater change in mean depression scores from baseline in those who received the active bright light therapy than those who received inactive therapy. This result is consistent with a systematic review of light therapy for non-seasonal depression that reported the efficacy of bright light against placebo conditions (<LINK REF="REF-Even-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Even 2008</LINK>). This review noted that most of the studies included had small numbers, inadequate control conditions, and were short-term (two to five weeks). The side effects of bright light therapy include headache, eye strain, nausea, and agitation, but these are generally mild and rarely lead to treatment discontinuation (<LINK REF="REF-Ravindran-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ravindran 2009</LINK>). Bright light therapy may be an attractive treatment for antenatal depression because it is low cost, home-based, and has a much lower side effect profile than pharmacotherapy. In a interesting review by <LINK REF="REF-Crowley-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Crowley 2012</LINK>, there are several factors related to the pathophysiology of depression and response to light which might make bright light especially suitable for antenatal depression. For example, bright light treatment could potentially offset insufficient low levels of light exposure; pathological hormonal profiles; co-morbidities, including disturbed sleep and fatigue; and serotonergic dysregulation which has been linked to inadequate maternal behaviour. Only three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Epperson-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Epperson 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Oren-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oren 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wirz_x002d_Justice-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Wirz-Justice 2011</LINK>) have examined bright light therapy in depressed pregnant women. Larger randomised controlled trials are needed since bright light may be preferable to other types of treatment.These trials should have adequate control conditions, provide treatment for five weeks or longer, provide comparative effectiveness, and address co-morbidities that bright light could alleviate such as anxiety, disturbed sleep, and fatigue.</P>
<P>While omega-3 fatty acids are one of the most widely used non-vitamin supplements, there are insufficient data from adequately powered controlled trials to say whether omega-3 fatty acids are efficacious in the treatment of depression (<LINK REF="REF-Freeman-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Freeman 2011</LINK>). Most randomised controlled trials have been small and of short duration and have yielded inconsistent findings (<LINK REF="REF-Freeman-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Freeman 2011</LINK>). Further, the majority of trials have evaluated omega-3 fatty acids as an adjunctive treatment and the doses and composition of the omega-3 supplements have been extremely variable. In this review, two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Freeman-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Freeman 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Su-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Su 2008</LINK>) evaluated the effect of omega-3 fatty acids as a treatment for antenatal depression. One trial (<LINK REF="STD-Su-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Su 2008</LINK>) found a positive effect of omega-3 fatty acids on depressive symptomatology immediately post-treatment while the trial (<LINK REF="STD-Freeman-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Freeman 2008</LINK>) did not. However, there was significant improvement from baseline in both groups in this trial, which could be attributed to the supportive therapy that all women in both groups received. It is important to note that this trial was very small (n = 21) and insufficiently powered to detect differences between study groups. Given the growing evidence that supports the role that omega-3 fatty acids plays in mental illness and health (<LINK REF="REF-Freeman-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Freeman 2011</LINK>), research examining the effect of omega-3 supplementation in the treatment of antenatal depression is warranted. Future trials should determine if: (1) omega-3 fatty acids are efficacious as a monotherapy; (2) there is an optimal dose, ratio of EPA/DHA, and treatment course; and (3) the dose needs to be tailored to individuals based on dietary habits (<LINK REF="REF-Freeman-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Freeman 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>There were no trials evaluating other non-psychosocial/psychological interventions in the treatment of antenatal depression such as physical exercise. Exercise is a relatively low-cost intervention, with minimal side effects, and there is now evidence to support the antidepressant effects of exercise in general and clinical populations (<LINK REF="REF-Lawlor-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lawlor 2001</LINK>). Limited evidence also supports a relationship between participation in exercise and a reduction in postpartum depression. For example, a review article explored the potential role of exercise, particularly pram walking, as an adjunctive treatment for postpartum depression (<LINK REF="REF-Daley-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Daley 2007</LINK>). Two small randomised controlled trials conducted in Australia were included in this review, which supported exercise as a useful treatment for women with postpartum depression (<LINK REF="REF-Armstrong-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Armstrong 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Armstrong-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Armstrong 2004</LINK>). Given the reluctance by some women to use anti-depressant medication antenatally and the limited availability of psychosocial and psychological therapies (<LINK REF="REF-Dennis-2007b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dennis 2007b</LINK>), exercise as a therapeutic possibility for depressed pregnant women deserves further exploration.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2013-07-14 15:37:03 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Lynn Hampson">
<P>Antenatal depression is common, and perhaps more prevalent than postpartum depression (<LINK REF="REF-Bennett-2004a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bennett 2004a</LINK>). Further, research consistently indicates that for many women, antenatal depression continues into the postpartum period leaving the woman and her child at risk for the negative outcomes associated with both antenatal (<LINK REF="REF-Bennett-2004b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bennett 2004b</LINK>) and postpartum depression (<LINK REF="REF-Grace-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grace 2003</LINK>). In the light of potential or perceived concerns associated with the use of anti-depressant medication during pregnancy and the potential lack of resources to access or obtain psychosocial or psychological interventions, other alternative forms of treatment are needed for antenatal depression. There are an increasing number of randomised controlled trials for alternative treatments. The quality of many trials remains an issue, with variability in diagnostic criteria, small sample sizes, limitations of blinding and placebo controls, and few systematic evaluations of side effects. Even for those treatments with reasonable evidence of efficacy, there are variations and lack of standardisation in dosage, potency, and concentration, all of which make it difficult for health professionals and women to be confident they are using the same doses as described in clinical studies. Future research needs to address these issues. There is, on balance, greater evidence and clinical experience with traditional treatments (pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy).</P>

<APPENDIX_BODY MODIFIED="2013-07-14 15:29:42 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jill V Hampson">
<P>The following methods were used to assess <LINK REF="STD-Manber-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Manber 2004</LINK>.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Selection of studies</HEADING>
<P>We assessed for inclusion all potential studies we identified as a result of the search strategy. We resolved any disagreement through discussion.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Data extraction and management</HEADING>
<P>Each author independently extracted data from trial reports using a pilot-tested data extraction form developed by the primary author. We resolved discrepancies through discussion. We used the Review Manager software (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2003</LINK>) to double enter all the data or a sub-sample. There was no need to contact authors of the original reports to provide further details.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Assessment of methodological quality of included studies</HEADING>
<P>We assessed the validity of each study independently using the criteria outlined in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2005</LINK>). Methods used for generation of the randomisation sequence were described for the included trial.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(1) Selection bias (randomisation and allocation concealment)</HEADING>
<P>We assigned a quality score for each trial, using the following criteria:<BR/>(A) adequate concealment of allocation: such as telephone randomisation, consecutively numbered sealed opaque envelopes;<BR/>(B) unclear whether adequate concealment of allocation: such as list or table used, sealed envelopes, or study does not report any concealment approach;<BR/>(C) inadequate concealment of allocation: such as open list of random number tables, use of case record numbers, dates of birth or days of the week.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(2) Attrition bias (loss of participants, for example, withdrawals, dropouts, protocol deviations)</HEADING>
<P>We assessed completeness to follow up using the following criteria:<BR/>(A) less than 5% loss of participants;<BR/>(B) 5% to 9.9% loss of participants;<BR/>(C) 10% to 19.9% loss of participants;<BR/>(D) more than 20% loss of participants.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(3) Performance bias (blinding of participants, researchers and outcome assessment)</HEADING>
<P>We assessed blinding using the following criteria:<BR/>(A) blinding of participants (yes/no/unclear);<BR/>(B) blinding of caregiver (yes/no/unclear);<BR/>(C) blinding of outcome assessment (yes/no/unclear).</P>
<P>We assigned a rating to each trial, compared results and discussed differences until we reached agreement. We described reasons for exclusion of any apparently eligible trial in the 'Characteristics of excluded studies' table.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Measures of treatment effect</HEADING>
<P>We carried out statistical analysis using the Review Manager software (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2003</LINK>). We planned to use fixed-effect meta-analysis for combining data in the absence of significant heterogeneity if trials were sufficiently similar. If we had found heterogeneity, we planned to explore this by sensitivity analysis followed by random-effects if required. For dichotomous data, we presented results as summary risk ratio with 95% confidence intervals. For continuous data, we used the mean difference if outcomes were measured in the same way between trials. We would have used the standardised mean difference to combine trials that measured the same outcome, but used different methods. Had there been evidence of skewness, we would have reported this. For trials using different treatment strategies, we planned to analyse them separately and combine the results only if there was no reason to think that they differed in relevant ways. While the primary meta-analysis was based on the occurrence of depression or not (however measured by trialists), we incorporated several depression rating scales or cut-off points.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Intent-to-treat analysis</HEADING>
<P>We analysed data on all participants with available data in the group to which they are allocated, regardless of whether or not they received the allocated intervention. If in the original reports participants were not analysed in the group to which they were randomised, and there is sufficient information in the trial report, we attempted to restore them to the correct group.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Assessment of heterogeneity</HEADING>
<P>We planned to apply tests of heterogeneity between trials, if appropriate, using the I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic. Had we identified high levels of heterogeneity among the trials (exceeding 50%), we would have explored it by prespecified subgroup analysis and performed sensitivity analysis. We would have used a random-effects meta-analysis as an overall summary if this was considered appropriate.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Subgroup analyses</HEADING>
<P>Although not completed due to insufficient data, we planned to conduct subgroup analyses classifying whole trials by interaction tests as described by <LINK REF="REF-Deeks-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deeks 2001</LINK>. Two a priori subgroup analyses were planned:<BR/>(1) the effects of intervention mode (for example, individual versus group-based interventions); and<BR/>(2) the effects of intervention duration (for example, single-contact interventions versus multiple-contact interventions).</P>
<P>If within-trial subgroup analysis was required, we conducted a separate meta-analysis for participants in each subgroup.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Sensitivity analyses</HEADING>
<P>Although not completed due to insufficient data, we planned to conduct sensitivity analysis to explore the effect of trial quality. This would have involved analysis based on an A, B, C or D rating of selection bias and attrition bias. Studies of poor quality would have been excluded in the analysis (those rating B, C or D) in order to assess for any substantive difference to the overall result.</P>
