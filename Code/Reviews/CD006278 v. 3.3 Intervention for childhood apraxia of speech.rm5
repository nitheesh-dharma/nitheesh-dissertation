<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2008-05-14 13:17:13 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Children who have childhood apraxia of speech (CAS) find it very difficult to make sounds in the right order, which makes it hard for others to understand them. Communication can thus break down between speaker and listener.  </P>
<P>At present, there is a lack of agreement in the clinical and research community about how to diagnose CAS (ASHA 2007). The number of treatment investigations reported in the literature has been severely limited, perhaps at least in part due to this lack of consensus on the underlying nature or diagnosis of CAS. This review investigates the effectiveness of treatment delivered by Speech Language Pathologists targeting CAS in children and adolescents.</P>
<P>The review demonstrates that there are currently too few well-controlled studies in this field to enable conclusions to be drawn about the efficacy of treatment for the entire CAS population, and calls for SLPs working in this area to design better studies.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-05-13 16:24:21 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The diagnostic criteria for Childhood Apraxia of Speech (CAS), and the underlying cause(s) for this disorder, remain heavily debated. Some agreement exists that children with CAS may have impairments in one or more of the following domains: non-speech oral motor function, motor speech function, speech sounds and structures (i.e., syllable and word shapes), prosody, language, phonemic awareness / metalinguistic skills, and literacy .Recently consensus has been reached that only three features across these domains have diagnostic validity: (1) inconsistent error production on both consonants and vowels across repeated productions of syllables or words, (2) lengthened and impaired coarticulatory transitions between sounds and syllables, and (3) inappropriate prosody  (ASHA 2007). Perhaps due to the ongoing deliberation over aetiology and diagnosis, little evidence on intervention for CAS is published.</P>

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2008-05-14 10:35:50 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jo A Abbott">
<P>The following databases were searched: CENTRAL (Issue 4, 2006), MEDLINE (1966 to 01/2007), CINAHL (1982 to 12/2006), EMBASE (1980 to 01/2007), ERIC (1965 to 01/2007), Linguistics Abstracts Online (1985 to 01/2007),  PsycINFO (1872 to 01/2007). Reference lists of articles thus identified were examined. </P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2008-05-14 13:06:16 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The review considered randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-randomised studies of children aged 3 to 16 years with CAS, grouped by treatment types (e.g., perceptual and instrumentally-based biofeedback treatment techniques).</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2008-05-14 13:17:06 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two authors independently assessed titles and abstracts identified from the searches and obtained full text versions of all potentially relevant articles. Articles were assessed for design and risk of bias. In addition to outcome data, a range of variables about participant group and outcomes were documented.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2008-05-13 12:20:08 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Of 825 titles and abstracts searched, only 31 abstracts appeared to meet inclusion criteria. The remaining 794 papers were excluded predominantly on the basis of not including participants with CAS (e.g., focused on other developmental speech disorders or adult acquired apraxia of speech), or for not being intervention studies (i.e. being diagnostic or descriptive). All 31 full text articles obtained were excluded following evaluation as they did not meet inclusion criteria on design. . Thus no studies are included in this review.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2009-08-10 10:08:07 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Chris Champion">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2009-08-10 10:08:07 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Chris Champion">
<P>Morley, Court and Miller (<LINK REF="REF-Morley-1954" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morley 1954</LINK>) provided a seminal paper documenting a series of speech characteristics in children that resembled the speech production disorder of adults with acquired apraxia of speech. There are various terms used today to denote this cluster of developmental apraxic speech symptoms in children, however the most common nosology includes the terms Childhood Apraxia of Speech (CAS), Developmental Verbal Dyspraxia (DVD), and Developmental Apraxia of Speech (DAS).</P>
<P>There are no epidemiological data currently available on the prevalence of CAS, although it occurs infrequently in comparison with other forms of developmental speech disorder (e.g., phonological disorder). The aetiology of CAS is also largely unknown but - as with other forms of speech and language disorder (<LINK REF="REF-Bishop-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bishop 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lewis-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lewis 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tallal-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tallal 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Scheffer-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scheffer 2000</LINK>) - a familial link has been reported (<LINK REF="REF-Lewis-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lewis 2004</LINK>). The potential for heritability of the disorder has been confirmed in one particular subgroup where CAS is reported to develop subsequent to genetic disruption of the <I>FOXP2 </I>gene (<LINK REF="REF-Vargha_x002d_Khadem-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vargha-Khadem 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lai-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lai 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shriberg-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shriberg 2006</LINK>). The FOXP2 gene is heavily expressed in the brain (<LINK REF="REF-Lai-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lai 2001</LINK>), and genetic disruption of FOXP2 in affected family members has been associated with both structural (<LINK REF="REF-Belton-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Belton 2003</LINK>) and functional (<LINK REF="REF-Liegeois-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liegeois 2003</LINK>) variations in neural regions known to subserve speech function. The FOXP2 gene however, is reported to account for only a very small subgroup of children with CAS. Children with complex neurobehavioural and genetic disorders (e.g., autism, epilepsy, galactosemia) have also been reported to present with CAS (see <LINK REF="REF-ASHA-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">ASHA 2007</LINK> for review).</P>
<P>In relation to the diagnosis of CAS, clinicians are unable to agree on the ultimate discriminating features or assessment tasks for differentiating the disorder from other forms of developmental speech impairment. There is some agreement that children with CAS may have impairments in one or in a combination of the following broad domains: non-speech oral motor function, motor speech function, speech sounds and structures (i.e., syllable and word shapes), prosody, language, phonemic awareness/metalinguistics, and literacy (<LINK REF="REF-ASHA-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">ASHA 2007</LINK>). Consensus has recently been reached that 3 features of CAS across these domains have diagnostic validity: (a) inconsistent error production on both consonants and vowels across repeated productions of syllables or words, (b) lengthened and impaired coarticulatory transitions between sounds and syllables, and (c) inappropriate prosody (<LINK REF="REF-ASHA-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">ASHA 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>Despite the disorder being reported over fifty years ago, neither the diagnostic features nor the underlying cause of the disorder can be agreed upon (<LINK REF="REF-ASHA-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">ASHA 2007</LINK>). In particular, whether the childhood form of apraxia of speech is due to an underlying linguistic or motor deficit or a combination of both is heavily debated. It has been difficult to dissociate motor and linguistic features of verbal dyspraxia because lexical, phonological and articulation deficits co-occur and are commonly assessed simultaneously during a clinical evaluation due to the very nature of the assessment tasks (<LINK REF="REF-Maassen-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maassen 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>There is also little knowledge of how CAS changes across time, although younger children present with more severe forms of the disorder with improvement over time in the presence of persistent irregular consonant, vowel and syllable-level errors (<LINK REF="REF-Davis-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davis 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jacks-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jacks 2006</LINK>). It is not known how age, or severity of CAS impact upon treatment success.</P>
<P>Historically, CAS was reported to be a disorder of motor programming, whereby children were unable to accurately program the sound sequences required to produce accurate speech. Initial treatment approaches were subsequently motor-based in line with the proposed underlying basis of the impairment. One of the earliest treatment methods still advocated in recent times is a form of traditional articulation-based drill therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Velleman-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Velleman 1994</LINK>). In this form of treatment the child is first taught to produce a sound in isolation (e.g., /r/) using a drill-based approach, and is then required to combine this newly acquired phoneme with a range of high-frequency use vowels in syllables. Gradually, with increasing performance success, the number of syllables in a word is increased. Theoretically this treatment is designed to improve a child's motor programming abilities using drill practice to automatise or store sound sequences, presumably helping them to access sound sequences more easily in future. This model is well aligned with the model of speech production proposed by Levelt (<LINK REF="REF-Levelt-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Levelt 1999</LINK>) whereby the complex act of speech is achieved through rapid access to a set of stored frequently used syllables. Other motor-based approaches reported in the literature include rate control therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Rosenthal-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rosenthal 1994</LINK>) and electropalatography (<LINK REF="REF-Carter-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carter 2004</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2009-08-05 12:23:35 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Chris Champion">
<P>In recent times however, with little consensus on the underlying nature or diagnosis of CAS, the number of treatment investigations and newly proposed treatment types has been severely limited. The underlying hypotheses supporting existing interventions have been widespread, making it difficult to group the treatment types.</P>
<P>At a broad level, one sub-grouping consists of perceptually-based therapy approaches including traditional articulation or phonological therapy, the PROMPT System (Prompts for restructuring oral muscular phonetic targets) (<A HREF="Chumpelik  1984">Chumpelik 1984</A>), melodic intonation therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Helfrich_x002d_Miller-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Helfrich-Miller 1994</LINK>), ACT (adapted cueing technique) (<LINK REF="REF-Klick-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Klick 1985</LINK>), oral form recognition training (<LINK REF="REF-Kingston-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kingston 1987</LINK>), dynamic temporal and tactile cueing (DTTC) (<LINK REF="STD-Strand-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Strand 2006</LINK>), orofacial myofunctional therapy (<LINK REF="STD-Ray-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ray 2003</LINK>), rate control therapy (<LINK REF="STD-Rosenthal-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Rosenthal 1994</LINK>) and alternative and augmentative methods of communication (<LINK REF="STD-Binger-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Binger 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cumley-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Cumley 1999</LINK>). A second subgroup consists of more instrumentally-based biofeedback treatments including delayed auditory feedback (<LINK REF="STD-Lozano-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Lozano 1978</LINK>) and electropalatography (<LINK REF="REF-Carter-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carter 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lundeborg-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Lundeborg 2007</LINK>).</P>

<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2008-05-13 15:59:14 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Recently a non-systematic review of treatment for CAS stated that there were currently no high-level evidence studies conducted in this field to date (<LINK REF="REF-ASHA-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">ASHA 2007</LINK>). In summary, there has been no systematic review of the efficacy of treatment for CAS to date.</P>
<P>Whilst CAS requires further refinement in relation to consensus on a more specific and wider range of diagnostic features and underlying correlates of the disorder, children requiring treatment continue to present with the disorder, and there is a need for clinicians to be aware of the evidence base of treatments, and which are the most efficacious. This paper aims to systematically review the evidence for the efficacy of perceptual and instrumentally-based biofeedback treatment types for children and adolescents with CAS.</P>

Fourteen studies were excluded for not being quasi-experimental or RCT in design (<LINK REF="STD-Binger-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Binger 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bornman-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Bornman 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cumley-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Cumley 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Carter-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Carter 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Daly-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Daly 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hall-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Hall 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Harris-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Harris 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Helfrich_x002d_Miller-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Helfrich-Miller 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lundeborg-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Lundeborg 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Morgan-Barry-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Morgan Barry 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rosenbek-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Rosenbek 1974</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Velleman-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Velleman 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Strand-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Strand 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Strand-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Strand 2006</LINK>). Five studies were excluded for not including experimental treatment data (e.g., overviews or non-systematic reviews of intervention approaches) (<LINK REF="STD-Chappell-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Chappell 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Groenen-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Groenen 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Klick-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Klick 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hayden-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Hayden 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Square-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Square 1994</LINK>).</P>
<P>Six papers were excluded for including participants with adult acquired apraxia of speech and not CAS (<LINK REF="STD-Bose-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Bose 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dworkin-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Dworkin 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Katz-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Katz 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lozano-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Lozano 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ray-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ray 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hadar-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Hadar 1984</LINK>). The remaining papers were also excluded for not including CAS participants. These studies were focused on children with motor dyspraxia, rather than apraxia of speech (<LINK REF="STD-Richardson-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Richardson 2004</LINK>), general speech disorder (<LINK REF="STD-Kingston-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Kingston 1987</LINK>; Forrest 2003), or grouped a combination of children with CAS and other forms of speech disorder without dissociating between participants (<LINK REF="STD-Head-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Head 1975</LINK>), precluding specific conclusions being drawn about the CAS participants response to treatment. One paper was excluded because the methodology did not enable determination of whether the participant had CAS or only some &#8216;dyspractic features&#8217; (<LINK REF="STD-Jaroma-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Jaroma 1984</LINK>).</P>
<P>The final excluded study consisted of three separate treatment case discussions, including a single longitudinal descriptive case study (1M followed from 3;5 to 8;6y), a single descriptive case study (1M 16 y), and a descriptive study of mixed design consisting of a group of four participants (3M, 1F, aged 10 to 14 years) (<LINK REF="STD-Rosenthal-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Rosenthal 1994</LINK>). The group of four participants within the mixed design study underwent one aspect of treatment which was quasi-experimental in nature; an ABAB design comparing baseline (typical speaking rate) to a treatment mode (reducing speech rate to approximately 50% of the participants typical speaking rate). The exact duration and intensity of treatment was not reported for each individual. Furthermore, a combination of additional treatment techniques were added to the rate control therapy in a second phase, and the exact nature, duration and intensity of this approach was not reported, nor were quantitative data on specific outcomes for individual participants. As a result, this study did not allow clear conclusions to be drawn about treatment effect for specific techniques for individual participants and was excluded. In summary, no RCT or quasi-experimental studies were found in this field.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2008-05-13 16:17:32 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The present review sought to investigate the effectiveness of CAS intervention for children and young people aged 3-16 years of age. No studies met the methodological inclusion criterion i.e. no quasi-experimental or RCT studies were available. In the absence of  well-controlled studies no conclusions can currently be drawn about the effectiveness of particular treatments for individuals with CAS. Well-controlled studies are urgently required in this field as effective interventions will not only have long-term positive impacts for children with CAS, but will also have wider socio-economic benefits on the healthcare/education system.</P>
<P>Cochrane reviews are often criticised in small behavioural fields such as Speech-Language Pathology (SLP) because they will not take into consideration lower levels of evidence, typically culminating in the finding: &#8216;not enough evidence to enable conclusions to be drawn&#8217;, as is provided in the present study. Critics argue that many  speech disorders (e.g., dysarthria and CAS) are relatively rare and therefore it is difficult to carry out large scale experimental trials. However this negative perspective is limiting. </P>
<P>However, regardless of the potential difficulties with performing RCTs or quasi-experimental methodologies in this field, it is possible to design well controlled individual case studies. This is a critical starting point in our field.  Modest-scale scale non-RCT studies should first establish which treatments may be appropriate for implementing in larger-scale RCTs. Interestingly two such studies were recently published (see <LINK REF="STD-Strand-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Strand 2006</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Lundeborg-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Lundeborg 2007</LINK>). This may reflect the SLP professions&#8217; increasing awareness that it is no longer appropriate to produce descriptive treatment case studies only, but that we need to implement an appropriate level of experimental control within investigations, to enable firm conclusions to be drawn about the association between treatment and outcome..  </P>
<P>The term evidence-based practice (EBP) has only been used by SLPs/SLTs over the past decade and the increased awareness of the need for EBP within the profession has had a greater impact on research culture in some settings than others. Academic SLP/SLT training institutions for example, have increasingly focused on teaching research methodologies, and have advocated for research in clinical practice post-graduation. Similarly in the clinical field, research gains have been made within health-based services in particular, as evidenced by the development of clinical pathways and protocols underpinned by evidence, to guide practice. Community, education and private-sector paediatric settings however, commonly present with fewer research supports and a more limited research culture. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the department in which an SLP/SLT works has been demonstrated to impact upon their use of research (<LINK REF="REF-Pennington-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pennington 2005</LINK>). These findings are of significant concern given that children with CAS most commonly present for assessment and treatment in community health or education settings. The impact of these broader research training and support limitations must be considered in relation to the lack of evidence in this field.   </P>
<P>Aside from the broader issues of research culture affecting the SLP profession, a number of more specific reasons may help to explain the lack of intervention data in the field of CAS to date, including: i) the lack of a definitive diagnostic classification system and outcome measures for these children; ii) a lack of understanding of the aetiology and longitudinal outcomes (&#8216;natural history&#8217;) for CAS; and iii) the low incidence or prevalence of the disorder. The potential impact of each of these factors on obtaining treatment evidence in CAS will be discussed in turn below. </P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Lack of a definitive diagnostic system and appropriate outcome measures</HEADING>
<P>Further research is critically needed in developing a consensus on the specific diagnostic features of CAS. Research is also needed to develop reliable and valid tools for assessing the particular diagnostic features of interest, and the severity of the disorder. Improvements in diagnosis will have a number of impacts on establishing an evidence base for treatment in this field.</P>
<P>Firstly improvements in diagnosis may help to alleviate the apparent hesitance of authors in systematically and explicitly reporting assessment and treatment data in intervention studies. This hesitancy is understandable at present given the debate over the diagnosis and characteristics of children with CAS. Clarity and explicit reporting is required for all areas of assessment and treatment of CAS however, specifically authors should consistently report on: what inclusion and exclusion criterion were used, exactly what assessments were used, what the baseline diagnostic and presenting features were of the participants, exactly what was treated (i.e., primary and secondary treatment targets) and how (i.e. nature, duration and intensity), what outcomes were measured (i.e. impairment, activity, participation) were applied, and what the resulting outcome was. Systematic reporting of assessment and treatment details is crucial to assist clinicians in interpreting or generalizing study findings to similar their speech disordered patients. Systematic reporting is also critical in enabling other researchers to replicate existing studies to determine whether the original intervention findings were robust. As highlighted by Law (<LINK REF="REF-Law-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Law 2003</LINK>) however, much of the important detailed information regarding exact intervention administration procedures may be lost during the writing up process. Modern publishers are unlikely to welcome this amount of detail for publication. This issue is not trivial and requires serious consideration by the SLP profession. Where possible authors should attempt to add additional appendices detailing treatment procedures, or should publish in journals that will allow these additional appendices to appear on the publishers&#8217; website.</P>
<P>There is also a lack of consensus regarding relevant outcome measures for this population. This is likely due in part to the poor consensus over the key features of CAS. If we do not understand how the disorder presents pre-treatment, how can we anticipate what may change and what we should measure post-treatment? Current CAS intervention studies have largely focused on impairment-based outcome measures only. Future systematic treatment efficacy studies should consider more functional impacts of the treatment beyond the level of impairment (i.e. activity and participation), the efficacy of treatment dependent upon differing communication environments (i.e. incorporating more naturalistic settings for the child with CAS such as home and school), and should consider ratings made by the child&#8217;s parents or peers and not just the clinician (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2002</LINK>). A caveat to this however, is that it is not appropriate to measure a large number of outcomes in studies containing small participant numbers. Statistical power must be evaluated and researchers should be clear about primary variables of interest (e.g., those variables being directly treated such as articulation of syllable sequences), secondary variables of interest (e.g., variables which may be indirectly affected by the treatment such as prosody), and what areas will be assessed for generalisation (e.g., syllables in words that were not directly treated)?</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Limited understanding of aetiology and natural history of CAS</HEADING>
<P>The lack of longitudinal data on the characteristics/natural history/recovery patterns of this paediatric population result in an inability to predict which children may recover quickly relative to cases with chronic persistent speech impairment (e.g., the case of 16 year old &#8216;Fred&#8217; in <LINK REF="STD-Rosenthal-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Rosenthal 1994</LINK>). Data on the natural history of CAS may assist in determining sub-groups of participants for comparison in treatment studies or controlled trials (i.e. to determine whether various sub-groups of patients would benefit most from certain treatment approaches). This data may also help determine whether some children respond better to treatment at particular &#8216;critical periods&#8217; of development (i.e. is earlier always better, or is there a benefit to waiting for maturation of other features which may affect treatment outcome, e.g., cognition?) </P>
<P>Giiven the suspected low incidence of this disorder, attempting an RCT would be extremely challenging in this patient group due to the small number of patients in any one geographical location, and because of the complexity of diagnosis and likely inclusion criteria. Furthermore, it may be challenging obtaining funding for treatment studies in CAS when the pool of participants is limited when compared to more prevalent paediatric public health concerns (e.g., developmental language disorder, obesity). These limitations and restrictions do not preclude the use of well controlled single subject quasi-experimental designs in this field however (e.g., multiple baseline case studies). Small well-controlled studies are a crucial first step in identifying treatments that may be suitable to trial in a larger randomised controlled trial.</P>

<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2008-05-13 15:14:26 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The present review concluded that there were no high-level evidence (RCT or quasi-experimental) CAS intervention studies in the literature to date. There are a wide range of treatment approaches reported in the literature, however the effectiveness of these interventions has not been stringently examined. Furthermore, only case study or case series investigations have been conducted, limiting the ability to generalise findings of existing studies to the broader population of children aged three to 16 years with CAS. Given the critical lack of evidence in the field, it is premature to definitively advocate a particular approach for clinical practice. Further well controlled studies investigating effectiveness of treatments for CAS are desperately required in the field.</P>
<P>Clinicians managing individuals with CAS in education and community settings should be empowered to engage in research through establishing links with local research-focused centres (e.g., academic institutions). </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2008-05-14 13:15:46 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is a critical need to work towards a consensus on the specific diagnostic features for CAS, and for severity rating scales in this population. Similarly, further research is required into outcome measures that consider activity and participation as well as impairment. Without this information studies will continue to use a variety of baseline and outcome measures, making it difficult to compare the efficacy of different intervention studies.</P>
<P>Consensus over the features of diagnosis would also facilitate the design of epidemiological studies to investigate the prevalence of DAS.</P>
<P>Longitudinal studies that examine speech outcome from early presentation throughout early childhood into adolescence are required to facilitate greater understanding of this group to assist in determining predictive and prognostic factors. Longitudinal studies will inform the eligibility criterion for sub-groupings for controlled trials in the future.</P>
<P>There is a critical need for further studies of treatment efficacy for CAS. Careful thought should be applied to the design of treatments for this challenging patient group. RCTs and quasi-randomised studies may be difficult to conduct given the heterogeneity of the nature and severity of CAS, and due to the reportedly low prevalence of the disorder.</P>
<P>Future studies may investigate numerous treatment variables common across many speech and language populations <LINK REF="REF-Law-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Law 2003</LINK> to increase our understanding of treatment response in this population, including:</P>
<UL>
<LI>type of treatment and level of breakdown treated (e.g., traditional articulation therapy versus instrumental biofeedback (EPG), treatment at the impairment versus activity versus participation level, treating speaker variables or listener variables, etc)</LI>
<LI>duration and intensity of treatment (e.g., intervention once/week over a year or 10 sessions over two weeks) </LI>
<LI>response of particular sub-groups of participants to treatment (e.g., sub-groups based on age, nature of speech deficits), or dependent upon similarity of co-morbid non-linguistic factors (e.g., gross and fine motor or cognitive outcome)</LI>
<LI>impact of timing of treatment (e.g., intervention at three vs five years)</LI>
<LI>the effect of the administrator of treatment (e.g., clinician, parent or participant administered therapy)</LI>

<P>
<B>Data extraction and management</B> </P>
<P>In addition to outcome data, the following information will be documented by both reviewers using a data management form to be developed and piloted: participant details; setting (e.g., community clinic, school, hospital); type of intervention; length and frequency of intervention; professions involved; duration of impairment; level of severity; co-morbidity; assessment tools employed. Any information that is missing or unclear will be requested from the corresponding author. Outcome data will be independently entered on to RevMan by (AV) and (AM) and a re-evaluation of the data and entries performed together by AV and AM to reach consensus on points of disagreement</P>
<P>
<B>Assessment of risk of bias in included studies</B> </P>
<P>Included trials will be evaluated against a number of criteria Both reviewers will assess and independently rate the risk of bias of included studies for the aspects: Methodological quality was assessed independently by two review authors (AV and AM) according to the Cochrane Collaboration Handbook (Higgins 2008). Review authors independently assessed the risk of bias within each included study based on the following six domains with ratings of 'Yes' (low risk of bias); 'No' (high risk of bias) and 'Unclear' (uncertain risk of bias):</P>
<OL>
<LI>
<B>Sequence generation</B>   Was the method used to generate the allocation sequence was assessed to determine if it produced comparable groups. Ratings: 'Yes' (low risk of bias); 'No' (high risk of bias) and 'Unclear' (uncertain risk of bias)</LI>
<LI>
<B>Allocation concealment</B>  Was the method used to conceal allocation sequence described in sufficient detail to assess whether intervention schedules could have been foreseen in advance of, or during, recruitment. In the review authors' judgment was allocation adequately concealed? Ratings: 'Yes' (low risk of bias); 'No' (high risk of bias) and 'Unclear' (uncertain risk of bias)</LI>
<LI>
<B>Blinding </B>Were any measures used to blind participants, personnel and outcome assessors described so as to assess knowledge of any group as to which intervention a given participant might have received In the review authors' judgment,: was knowledge of the allocated intervention adequately prevented during the study? Ratings: 'Yes' (low risk of bias); 'No' (high risk of bias) and 'Unclear' (uncertain risk of bias)</LI>
<LI>
<B>Incomplete outcome data</B> If studies do not report intention-to-treat analyses, we will madk attempts to obtain missing data by contacting the study authors. Data on attrition and exclusions will be extracted and reported as well the numbers involved (compared with total randomised), reasons for attrition/exclusion where reported or obtained from investigators, and any re-inclusions in analyses performed by review authors. In the review authors' judgment: were incomplete data dealt with adequately by the reviewers? (See also 'Dealing with missing data'). Ratings: 'Yes' (low risk of bias); 'No' (high risk of bias) and 'Unclear' (uncertain risk of bias)</LI>
<LI>
<B>Selective outcome reporting</B> Attempts will be made to assess the possibility of selective outcome reporting by investigators. In the review authors' judgment: are reports of the study free of suggestion of selective outcome reporting? Ratings: 'Yes' (low risk of bias); 'No' (high risk of bias) and 'Unclear' (uncertain risk of bias)</LI>
<LI>
<B>Other sources of bias</B> Was the study apparently free of other problems that could put it at a high risk of bias?</LI>
</OL>
<P>
<B>Measures of treatment effect</B>
</P>
<P>Continuous data: To enable the combination of studies measuring the same outcome using different methods, continuous data will be summarised using standardised mean differences.</P>
<P>Binary data: Binary outcomes are likely to be common in early reports within the field (e.g., improved outcome vs no change/worse). Data will be analysed by calculation of the relative risk with a 95% confidence interval.</P>
<P>
<B>Dealing with missing data</B>
</P>
<P>Missing data will initially be sought via contact with the corresponding author. In regard to participant drop out, if the rate of attrition reaches a 30% threshold in an included study, the study will be included in the systematic review but not in the meta-analysis . The maximum allowed difference in the dropout rate between the two groups will be 10% before a study included in the review is excluded from meta-analysis.</P>
<P>
<B>Assessment of heterogeneity</B>
</P>
<P>Consistency of results will be assessed by examining I-squared (Higgins 2002). I-squared is a quantity describing approximately the proportion of variation in point estimates that is due to heterogeneity of a sample rather than error in sampling of the population. A test of homogeneity will be used to determine that the heterogeneity is genuine. In the event of too few studies being available to make this test feasible, a random effects model will be applied</P>
<P>
<B>Assessment of reporting biases </B>
</P>
<P>Where appropriate, the possibility that the study selection was affected by bias will be assessed using funnel plots to investigate any relationship between effect size and study precision (closely related to sample size). Such a relationship could be due to publication or related biases or due to systematic differences between small and large studies, or a statistical artefact of the chosen effect measure.</P>
<P> <B>Data synthesis</B>
</P>
<P>Meta-analysis will be only performed where studies employ similar interventions and where study populations are clinically homogenous.</P>
