<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2016-10-20 10:18:19 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This is an updated version of the original Cochrane review published in Issue 1, 2006 of the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews.</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>Epilepsy is a common neurological disorder in which abnormal electrical discharges from the brain cause recurrent seizures. We studied two types of epileptic seizures in this review: generalised onset seizures in which electrical discharges begin in one part of the brain and move throughout the brain, and partial onset seizures (also known as focal onset seizures) in which the seizure is generated in and affects one part of the brain (the whole hemisphere of the brain or part of a lobe of the brain). Partial seizures may become generalised (secondary generalisation) and move from one part of the brain throughout the brain. For around 70% of people with epilepsy, a single antiepileptic drug can control generalised onset or partial onset seizures.</P>
<P>This review applies to people with partial seizures (with or without secondary generalisation) and people with generalised tonic-clonic seizures, a specific generalised seizure type. This review does not apply to people with other generalised seizure types such as absence seizures or myoclonic seizures as the recommended treatments for these seizure types are different.</P>
<P>
<B>Objective</B>
</P>
<P>Carbamazepine and lamotrigine are first-choice treatments for individuals with recently diagnosed epilepsy. The aim of this review was to compare how effective these drugs are at controlling seizures, to find out if they are associated with side effects that may result in individuals stopping the drug and to inform a choice between these drugs.</P>
<P>
<B>Methods</B>
</P>
<P>The last search for trials was in October 2016. We assessed the evidence from 13 randomised controlled trials comparing lamotrigine with carbamazepine. We were able to combine data for 2572 people from nine of the 13 trials; for the remaining 822 people from four trials, data were not available to use in this review.</P>
<P>
<B>Results</B>
</P>
<P>The results of the review suggest that people are more likely to withdraw earlier from carbamazepine than lamotrigine treatment. The most common drug-related reason for withdrawal was adverse events: 51% of total withdrawals in participants on carbamazepine and 36% of total withdrawals in participants on lamotrigine. The second most common drug-related cause for withdrawal was seizure recurrence: 56 of 683 total withdrawals (8%) on carbamazepine and 93 of 610 total withdrawals (15%) on lamotrigine.</P>
<P>The results also suggest that recurrence of seizures after starting treatment with lamotrigine may happen earlier than treatment with carbamazepine and seizure freedom for a period of six months may occur earlier on carbamazepine than lamotrigine. The majority of the people included in the 13 trials (88%) experienced partial seizures, so the results of this review apply mainly to people with this seizure type.</P>
<P>The most common side effects reported by participants during the trials were dizziness, fatigue, gastrointestinal problems, headaches and skin problems. These side effects were reported a similar number of times by people taking lamotrigine or carbamazepine.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
</P>
<P>For people with partial onset seizures, we judged the quality of the evidence to be high for the outcomes of seizure recurrence and remission of seizures and we judged the quality of the evidence to be moderate for the outcome of treatment withdrawal. The design of the trials (whether the people and treating clinicians knew which drug they were taking) may have influenced the rates of withdrawal from treatments. Up to 50% of people in the trials used in our results may have been wrongly classified as having generalised seizures; for people with generalised onset seizures, we judged the quality of the evidence to be moderate for the outcomes of seizure recurrence and remission of seizures and low quality for the outcome of treatment withdrawal.</P>
<P>
<B>Conclusions</B>
</P>
<P>For people with partial onset seizures, lamotrigine and carbamazepine are effective treatments and a choice between these two treatments must be made carefully. More information is needed for people with generalised onset seizures. We recommend that all future trials comparing these drugs, or any other antiepileptic drugs, should be designed using high-quality methods. Seizure types of people included in trials should also be classified very carefully to ensure that the results are also of high quality.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2016-10-13 11:38:11 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This is an updated version of the original Cochrane review published in Issue 1, 2006 of the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews.</P>
<P>Epilepsy is a common neurological condition in which abnormal electrical discharges from the brain cause recurrent unprovoked seizures. It is believed that with effective drug treatment up to 70% of individuals with active epilepsy have the potential to become seizure-free and to go into long-term remission shortly after starting drug therapy with a single antiepileptic drug (AED) in monotherapy.</P>
<P>The correct choice of first-line antiepileptic therapy for individuals with newly diagnosed seizures is of great importance. It is important that the choice of AEDs for an individual is made using the highest quality evidence regarding the potential benefits and harms of the various treatments. It is also important that the effectiveness and tolerability of AEDs appropriate to given seizure types are compared to one another.</P>
<P>Carbamazepine or lamotrigine are first-line recommended treatments for new onset partial seizures and as a first- or second-line treatment for generalised tonic-clonic seizures. Performing a synthesis of the evidence from existing trials will increase the precision of the results for outcomes relating to efficacy and tolerability and may assist in informing a choice between the two drugs.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2016-07-11 10:46:25 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>To review the time to withdrawal, remission and first seizure with lamotrigine compared to carbamazepine when used as monotherapy in people with partial onset seizures (simple or complex partial and secondarily generalised) or generalised onset tonic-clonic seizures (with or without other generalised seizure types).</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2016-10-20 10:18:12 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The first searches for this review were run in 1997. For the most recent update we searched the Cochrane Epilepsy Group Specialized Register (17 October 2016), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) via the Cochrane Register of Studies Online (CRSO, 17 October 2016) and MEDLINE (Ovid, 1946 to 17 October 2016). We imposed no language restrictions. We also contacted pharmaceutical companies and trial investigators.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2016-07-11 10:46:26 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Randomised controlled trials in children or adults with partial onset seizures or generalised onset tonic-clonic seizures comparing monotherapy with either carbamazepine or lamotrigine.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2016-07-11 10:46:32 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This was an individual participant data (IPD) review. Our primary outcome was time to withdrawal of allocated treatment and our secondary outcomes were time to first seizure post-randomisation, time to six-month, 12-month and 24-month remission, and incidence of adverse events. We used Cox proportional hazards regression models to obtain trial-specific estimates of hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), using the generic inverse variance method to obtain the overall pooled HR and 95% CI.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-07-18 10:35:16 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included 13 studies in this review. Individual participant data were available for 2572 participants out of 3394 eligible individuals from nine out of 13 trials: 78% of the potential data. For remission outcomes, a HR &lt; 1 indicated an advantage for carbamazepine and for first seizure and withdrawal outcomes a HR &lt; 1 indicated an advantage for lamotrigine.</P>
<P>The main overall results (pooled HR adjusted for seizure type) were: time to withdrawal of allocated treatment (HR 0.72, 95% CI 0.63 to 0.82), time to first seizure (HR 1.22, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.37) and time to six-month remission (HR 0.84, 95% CI 0.74 to 0.94), showing a significant advantage for lamotrigine compared to carbamazepine for withdrawal but a significant advantage for carbamazepine compared to lamotrigine for first seizure and six-month remission. We found no difference between the drugs for time to 12-month remission (HR 0.91, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.07) or time to 24-month remission (HR 1.00, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.25), however only two trials followed up participants for more than one year so the evidence is limited.</P>
<P>The results of this review are applicable mainly to individuals with partial onset seizures; 88% of included individuals experienced seizures of this type at baseline. Up to 50% of the limited number of individuals classified as experiencing generalised onset seizures at baseline may have had their seizure type misclassified, therefore we recommend caution when interpreting the results of this review for individuals with generalised onset seizures.</P>
<P>The most commonly reported adverse events for both of the drugs across all of the included trials were dizziness, fatigue, gastrointestinal disturbances, headache and skin problems. The rate of adverse events was similar across the two drugs.</P>
<P>The methodological quality of the included trials was generally good, however there is some evidence that the design choice of masked or open-label treatment may have influenced the withdrawal rates of the trials. Hence, we judged the quality of the evidence for the primary outcome of treatment withdrawal to be moderate for individuals with partial onset seizures and low for individuals with generalised onset seizures. For efficacy outcomes (first seizure, remission), we judged the quality of evidence to be high for individuals with partial onset seizures and moderate for individuals with generalised onset seizures.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2016-07-11 10:47:43 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Lamotrigine was significantly less likely to be withdrawn than carbamazepine but the results for time to first seizure suggested that carbamazepine may be superior in terms of seizure control. A choice between these first-line treatments must be made with careful consideration. We recommend that future trials should be designed to the highest quality possible with consideration of masking, choice of population, classification of seizure type, duration of follow-up, choice of outcomes and analysis, and presentation of results.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2016-10-13 11:38:43 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review is an update of a previously published review in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (Issue 1, 2006) on 'Lamotrigine versus carbamazepine monotherapy for epilepsy' (<LINK REF="REF-Gamble-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gamble 2006</LINK>).</P>
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2016-07-11 10:48:08 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Epilepsy is a common neurological condition in which abnormal electrical discharges from the brain cause recurrent unprovoked seizures. Epilepsy is a disorder of many heterogenous seizure types, with an estimated incidence of 33 to 57 per 100,000 person-years worldwide (<LINK REF="REF-Annegers-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Annegers 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hirtz-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hirtz 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-MacDonald-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">MacDonald 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Olafsson-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Olafsson 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sander-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sander 1996</LINK>), accounting for approximately 1% of the global burden of disease (<LINK REF="REF-Murray-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Murray 1994</LINK>). The lifetime risk of epilepsy onset is estimated to be 1300 to 4000 per 100,000 person-years (<LINK REF="REF-Hauser-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hauser 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Juul_x002d_Jenson-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Juul-Jenson 1983</LINK>), and the lifetime prevalence could be as large as 70 million people worldwide (<LINK REF="REF-Ngugi-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ngugi 2010</LINK>). It is believed that with effective drug treatment, up to 70% of individuals with active epilepsy have the potential to go into long-term remission shortly after starting drug therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Cockerell-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cockerell 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hauser-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hauser 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sander-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sander 2004</LINK>), and around 70% of individuals can achieve seizure freedom using a single antiepileptic drug (AED) in monotherapy (<LINK REF="REF-Cockerell-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cockerell 1995</LINK>). Current National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines recommend that both adults and children with epilepsy should be treated with monotherapy wherever possible (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2012</LINK>). The remaining 30% of individuals experience refractory or drug-resistant seizures, which often require treatment with combinations of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) or alternative treatments, such as epilepsy surgery (<LINK REF="REF-Kwan-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kwan 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>We studied two seizure types in this review: generalised onset seizures in which electrical discharges begin in one part of the brain and move throughout the brain, and partial onset seizures in which the seizure is generated in and affects one part of the brain (the whole hemisphere of the brain or part of a lobe of the brain).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2016-10-13 11:38:43 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Carbamazepine was amongst the earliest 'traditional' drugs licensed for the treatment of epileptic seizures and has been commonly used as monotherapy for partial onset and generalised onset seizures for over 30 years (<LINK REF="REF-Shakir-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shakir 1980</LINK>). Lamotrigine is among a 'second generation' of AEDs, licensed as monotherapy for epileptic seizures following demonstrations of efficacy compared to 'traditional' AEDs such as carbamazepine (<LINK REF="REF-Brodie-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brodie 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Brodie-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Brodie 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Reunanen-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Reunanen 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>Comparative trials have also shown newer AEDs such as lamotrigine to be to be generally well tolerated as monotherapy in both adults and children and related to fewer adverse events, fewer serious adverse events and fewer drug interactions with concomitant AEDs and other concomitant medications than 'traditional' first-line AEDs such as carbamazepine (<LINK REF="REF-Brodie-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brodie 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Brodie-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Brodie 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-French-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">French 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Reunanen-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Reunanen 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>Evidence regarding teratogenic effects (disturbances to foetal development) of carbamazepine and lamotrigine is conflicting and uncertain. It is thought that the risk of congenital malformation may be higher for women taking carbamazepine compared to the general population (<LINK REF="REF-Meador-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meador 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Morrow-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morrow 2006</LINK>), and carbamazepine has been shown to be associated with neural tube defects (<LINK REF="REF-Matlow-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Matlow 2012</LINK>). The risk of malformations is thought to be lower for women taking lamotrigine than carbamazepine (<LINK REF="REF-Meador-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meador 2008</LINK>), but the risk of malformation may increase with an increasing dose of lamotrigine (<LINK REF="REF-Morrow-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morrow 2006</LINK>). It is unclear whether taking carbamazepine or lamotrigine during pregnancy has any negative neurodevelopmental effects on the child (<LINK REF="REF-Bromley-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bromley 2014</LINK>).</P>
<P>Current NICE guidelines for adults and children recommend carbamazepine or lamotrigine as a first-line treatments for new onset partial seizures and as a second-line treatment for generalised tonic-clonic seizures (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2012</LINK>). Lamotrigine is considered a suitable first-line treatment for new onset generalised seizures if sodium valproate is considered unsuitable. Carbamazepine may be a suitable second-line treatment for generalised onset seizures but may exacerbate myoclonic or absence seizures (<LINK REF="REF-Liporace-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liporace 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shields-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shields 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Snead-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Snead 1985</LINK>).</P>

<P>Antiepileptic drugs suppress seizures by reducing neuronal excitability (disruption of the usual mechanisms of a neuron within the brain, which may lead to an epileptic seizure) (<LINK REF="REF-MacDonald-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">MacDonald 1995</LINK>). Lamotrigine and carbamazepine are broad-spectrum treatments suitable for many seizure types, and both have an anticonvulsant mechanism through blocking ion channels and binding with neurotransmitter receptors, or through inhibiting the metabolism or reuptake of neurotransmitters (<LINK REF="REF-Brodie-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brodie 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lees-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lees 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ragsdale-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ragsdale 1991</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2016-07-11 10:48:31 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>With evidence that up to 70% of individuals with active epilepsy have the potential to go into long-term remission of seizures shortly after starting drug therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Cockerell-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cockerell 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hauser-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hauser 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sander-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sander 2004</LINK>), the correct choice of first-line antiepileptic therapy for individuals with newly diagnosed seizures is of great importance. It is important that the choice of AEDs for an individual is made using the highest quality evidence regarding the potential benefits and harms of various treatments. It is also important that the effectiveness and tolerability of AEDs appropriate to given seizure types are compared to one another.</P>
<P>Therefore the aim of this review is to summarise efficacy and tolerability from existing randomised controlled trials comparing lamotrigine and carbamazepine, two current first-line recommended treatments for use in monotherapy for epileptic seizures. Performing a synthesis of the evidence from existing trials will increase the precision of the results for outcomes relating to efficacy and tolerability and may assist in informing a choice between the two drugs.</P>
<P>There are difficulties in undertaking a systematic review of epilepsy monotherapy trials as the important efficacy outcomes require analysis of time-to-event data (for example, time to first seizure after randomisation). Although methods have been developed to synthesise time-to-event data using summary information (<LINK REF="REF-Parmar-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parmar 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Williamson-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Williamson 2002</LINK>), the appropriate statistics are not commonly reported in published epilepsy trials (<LINK REF="REF-Nolan-2013a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nolan 2013a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Williamson-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Williamson 2000</LINK>). Furthermore, although most epilepsy monotherapy trials collect seizure data, there has been no uniformity in the definition and reporting of outcomes. For example, trials may report time to 12-month remission but not time to first seizure or vice versa, or some trials may define time to first seizure from the date of randomisation while others use the date of achieving maintenance dose. Trial investigators have also adopted differing approaches to the analysis, particularly with respect to the censoring of time-to-event data. For these reasons, we performed this review using individual participant data (IPD), which helps to overcome these problems. This review is one in a series of Cochrane IPD reviews investigating pair-wise monotherapy comparisons (<LINK REF="REF-Nolan-2013b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nolan 2013b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nolan-2013c" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nolan 2013c</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nolan-2013d" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nolan 2013d</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nolan-2015a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nolan 2015a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nolan-2015b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nolan 2015b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Marson-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marson 2000</LINK>).

<P>For each trial for which we did not obtain individual participant data (IPD), we carried out an assessment to see whether any relevant aggregate level data had been reported or could be indirectly estimated using the methods of <LINK REF="REF-Parmar-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parmar 1998</LINK> and<BR/>
<LINK REF="REF-Williamson-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Williamson 2002</LINK>. Where graphical time-to-event data (e.g. Kaplan Meier curves) were published with or without corresponding effective numbers at risk, we used a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet (<LINK REF="REF-Excel-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Excel 2010</LINK>), to indirectly estimate hazard ratios (<LINK REF="REF-Tierney-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tierney 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>Four trials including 1391 participants provided seizure data in terms of the number of seizures recorded between each follow-up visit rather than specific dates of seizures (<LINK REF="STD-Eun-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Eun 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lee-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Lee 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-SANAD-A-2007" TYPE="STUDY">SANAD A 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Werhahn-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Werhahn 2015</LINK>). To enable the calculation of time-to-event outcomes, we applied linear interpolation to approximate dates of seizures between follow-up visits. For example, if the trial recorded four seizures between two visits that occurred on 1 March 2010 and 1 May 2010 (interval of 61 days), then the date of first seizure would be approximately 13 March 2010. This allowed the computation of an estimate of the time to six-month remission, 12-month remission, 24-month remission and first seizure.</P>
<P>We calculated time to six-month, 12-month and 24-month remission from the date of randomisation to the date (or estimated date) that the individual had first been free of seizures for six, 12 or 24 months, respectively. If the person had one or more seizures during the trial, a six-month, 12-month or 24 month seizure-free period could also occur between the estimated date of the last seizure during the trial and a period of six, 12 or 24 months of seizure freedom.</P>
<P>We calculated time to first seizure from the date of randomisation to the date that we estimated their first seizure to have occurred. If seizure data were missing for a particular visit, we censored these outcomes at the previous visit. We also censored these outcomes if the individual died or if follow-up ceased prior to the occurrence of the event of interest. We used these methods in five trials including 1383 participants (<LINK REF="STD-Brodie-1995-A" TYPE="STUDY">Brodie 1995 A</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Brodie-1995-B" TYPE="STUDY">Brodie 1995 B</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Brodie-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Brodie 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nieto_x002d_Barrera-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Nieto-Barrera 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Reunanen-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Reunanen 1996</LINK>), for which we directly received outcome data (dates of seizures after randomisation).</P>
<P>For all trials we received data for date and reason of withdrawal from the trial. Time to treatment withdrawal was calculated as date of randomisation to date of withdrawal from the trial. For the analysis of time-to-event, we defined an 'event' as the withdrawal of the allocated treatment because of reasons related to the treatment(i.e. lack of efficacy, adverse events, or both lack of efficacy and adverse events), non-compliance with the treatment regimen, withdrawal of consent from the trial etc. We censored the outcome if treatment was withdrawn for reasons not related to the trial treatment: i.e. loss to follow-up, death (not treatment or epilepsy-related), withdrawal due to remission etc. We also censored individuals who were still on allocated treatment at the date of the end of follow-up. We considered documented reasons for withdrawal on a case by case basis for relation to treatment; two authors (SJN and AGM) independently classified reasons for withdrawals as events or censored and resolved any disagreements by discussion. If reasons for withdrawal were classified differently as events or censored in the included trials to our definitions, we conducted sensitivity analyses to account for differences in the definition of a withdrawal 'event' (see <LINK TAG="SENSITIVITY_ANALYSIS" TYPE="SECTION">Sensitivity analysis</LINK>).</P>

<DATA_SYNTHESIS MODIFIED="2016-07-11 10:52:54 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We carried out our analysis on an intention-to-treat basis (that is, we analysed participants in the group to which they were randomised, irrespective of which treatment they actually received). Therefore, for the time-to-event outcomes, 'time to six-month remission', 'time to 12-month remission', 'time to 24 month remission' and 'time to first seizure post-randomisation', we did not censor participants if treatment was withdrawn.</P>
<P>An intention-to-treat analysis tends toward finding no difference between treatments and we would have undertaken a secondary 'protocol correct' analysis as a sensitivity analysis if the primary analyses had suggested equivalence, in which case participants would have been censored at the time of drug withdrawal for seizure outcomes.</P>
<P>For all outcomes, we investigated the relationship between the time-to-event and treatment effect of the AEDs. We used Cox proportional hazards regression models to obtain trial-specific estimates of log (hazard ratio) or treatment effect and associated standard errors in statistical SAS® software, version 9.3 (SAS software. Copyright, SAS Institute Inc. SAS and all other SAS Institute Inc. product or service names are registered trademarks or trademarks of SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA). The model assumes that the ratio of hazards (risks) between the two treatment groups is constant over time (i.e. hazards are proportional). We tested this proportional hazards assumption of the Cox regression model for each outcome of each trial by testing the statistical significance of a time varying covariate in the model. We evaluated overall pooled estimates of hazard ratios (with 95% confidence intervals) using the generic inverse variance method. We expressed results as a hazard ratio (HR) and a 95% confidence interval (CI).</P>
<P>By convention, a HR greater than 1 indicates that an event is more likely to occur earlier on lamotrigine than on carbamazepine. Hence, for time to withdrawal of allocated treatment or time to first seizure, a HR greater than 1 indicates a clinical advantage for carbamazepine (e.g. a HR of 1.2 would suggest a 20% increase in risk of withdrawal from lamotrigine compared with carbamazepine), and for time to six-month, 12-month and 24-month remission a HR greater than 1 indicates a clinical advantage for lamotrigine (i.e. the seizure-free period occurs earlier on lamotrigine than carbamazepine).</P>

<P>We determined the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach, where we downgraded evidence in the presence of high risk of bias in at least one trial, indirectness of the evidence, unexplained heterogeneity or inconsistency, imprecision of results and high probability of publication bias. We downgraded evidence by one level if the limitation was considered serious and two levels if considered very serious, as judged by the review authors. Under the GRADE approach, evidence may also be upgraded if a large treatment effect is demonstrated with no obvious biases or if a dose-response effect exists.</P>

<LI>Misclassification of seizure type is a recognised problem in epilepsy, whereby some people with generalised seizures have been mistakenly classed as having partial onset seizures and vice versa. There is clinical evidence that individuals with generalised onset seizures are unlikely to have an 'age of onset' greater than 25 to 30 years (<LINK REF="REF-Malafosse-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Malafosse 1994</LINK>). Such misclassification impacted upon the results of three reviews in our series of pair-wise reviews for monotherapy in epilepsy comparing carbamazepine, phenobarbitone, phenytoin and sodium valproate in which around 30% to 50% of participants analysed may have had their seizure type misclassified as generalised onset (<LINK REF="REF-Nolan-2013b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nolan 2013b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nolan-2015a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nolan 2015a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nolan-2015b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nolan 2015b</LINK>). Given the potential biases introduced into those reviews, we examined the distribution of age at onset for individuals with generalised seizures in the trials included in this review, to assess the potential impact of misclassification of seizure type on the outcomes.</LI>

<LINK REF="STD-Eun-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Eun 2012</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Werhahn-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Werhahn 2015</LINK> recruited only individuals with partial onset seizures therefore there were no participants with new onset generalised seizures over the age of 30 in these trials.</P>
<P>Two trials were designed to include participants with partial onset seizures only, however three participants in <LINK REF="STD-Nieto_x002d_Barrera-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Nieto-Barrera 2001</LINK> and nine participants in <LINK REF="STD-SANAD-A-2007" TYPE="STUDY">SANAD A 2007</LINK> were classified as having generalised onset seizures. Further, seizure type was missing for 85 participants in <LINK REF="STD-SANAD-A-2007" TYPE="STUDY">SANAD A 2007</LINK>.

<LINK REF="TBL-04" TYPE="TABLE">Table 4</LINK> shows the reasons for premature termination for 3393 participants in all 13 included trials and how we classified these withdrawals in analysis of IPD. One participant randomised to lamotrigine in <LINK REF="STD-Nieto_x002d_Barrera-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Nieto-Barrera 2001</LINK> had missing date and reason for withdrawal and two participants in <LINK REF="STD-SANAD-A-2007" TYPE="STUDY">SANAD A 2007</LINK> has missing dates of withdrawal (one withdrew from lamotrigine due to remission of seizures and one withdrew from carbamazepine due to 'other' reasons not related to the allocated drug).</P>
<P>Times to withdrawal of allocated treatment and reasons for withdrawal were available for 2569 participants from the nine trials providing IPD (99.9% of 2572 participants with IPD available included in this analysis, see <LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK>) (<LINK REF="STD-Brodie-1995-A" TYPE="STUDY">Brodie 1995 A</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Brodie-1995-B" TYPE="STUDY">Brodie 1995 B</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Brodie-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Brodie 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Eun-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Eun 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lee-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Lee 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nieto_x002d_Barrera-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Nieto-Barrera 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Reunanen-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Reunanen 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-SANAD-A-2007" TYPE="STUDY">SANAD A 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Werhahn-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Werhahn 2015</LINK>).</P>
<P>Out of 3393 participants for whom we had reasons for treatment withdrawal, 1293 participants prematurely withdrew from treatment (38%): 610 out of 1891 (32%) participants randomised to lamotrigine and 683 out of 1502 (45%) participants randomised to carbamazepine. We deemed 1106 participants (86% of total withdrawals) to have withdrawn for reasons related to the allocated drug: 516 (85% of withdrawals) on lamotrigine and 590 (86% of withdrawals) on carbamazepine and we classified these withdrawals as 'events' in the analysis. The most common treatment-related reason for withdrawal was adverse events: 569 withdrawals (44% of total withdrawals), 219 (36% of total withdrawals) on lamotrigine and 350 (51% of total withdrawals) on carbamazepine.</P>
<P>We classed the other 187 withdrawals (94 on lamotrigine and 93 on carbamazepine) to be not related to the allocated drug and censored these participants in the analysis, in addition to the 2100 participants (1281 on lamotrigine and 819 on carbamazepine) who completed the trial without withdrawing.</P>
<P>The overall pooled HR (for 2569 participants providing IPD from nine trials) was 0.72 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.63 to 0.82, P value &lt; 0.00001) indicating a statistically significant advantage to lamotrigine; in other words, participants withdrew significantly earlier from carbamazepine than lamotrigine in the nine included trials (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>). No important heterogeneity was present between trials (I<SUP>2</SUP>= 19%).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Subgroup analyses: seizure type (partial versus generalised onset)</HEADING>
<P>Seizure type was missing for 85 participants from <LINK REF="STD-SANAD-A-2007" TYPE="STUDY">SANAD A 2007</LINK> and nine participants were classified as having generalised onset seizures, even though the trial was designed to include only participants with partial onset seizures. Similarly, in <LINK REF="STD-Nieto_x002d_Barrera-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Nieto-Barrera 2001</LINK>, including participants with partial onset seizures, three participants were classified as having generalised onset seizures. The latter three participants were excluded from the subgroup analyses (all completed the trial).</P>
<P>For participants with generalised onset seizures (299 participants providing IPD from six trials), the pooled HR was 0.46(95% CI 0.30 to 0.71, P value = 0.0003) and for participants with partial onset seizures (2182 participants providing IPD from nine trials) the pooled HR was 0.75(95% CI 0.64 to 0.86, P value = 0.0001) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>), indicating a statistically significant advantage for lamotrigine over carbamazepine for both participants with partial onset and generalised onset seizures. Excluding the nine participants from <LINK REF="STD-SANAD-A-2007" TYPE="STUDY">SANAD A 2007</LINK> with generalised onset seizures produced similar results and did not change the conclusions.</P>
<P>The test for subgroup differences between partial and generalised onset seizures was statistically significant (P value = 0.04, I² = 77.1% for variability due to subgroup differences). This indicates that the advantage for lamotrigine over carbamazepine may be larger in those with generalised onset seizures than in those with partial onset seizures. However, we recommend caution when interpreting this result due to the imbalance of subgroup sizes (only 13% of individuals had generalised onset seizures) and the potential misclassification of seizure type (see below).</P>
<P>The overall pooled HR (adjusted for epilepsy type for 2481 participants from nine trials) was HR 0.71(95% CI 0.62 to 0.81, P value &lt; 0.00001). No important heterogeneity was present between trials overall or by subgroups (I<SUP>2</SUP> &lt; 10%).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Sensitivity analyses</HEADING>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Reunanen-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Reunanen 1996</LINK> considered participants to have completed the trial and hence withdrew treatment if they experienced a seizure after week six. This does not correspond with the treatment withdrawal definition recommended by the Commission on Antiepileptic Drugs of the International League Against Epilepsy therefore we performed sensitivity analysis excluding this trial from <LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK> and <LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>. This sensitivity analysis produced similar results and did not change the conclusions.</P>
<P>One included trial allocated participants to three treatment arms: 100 mg/day lamotrigine (LTG100), 200 mg/day lamotrigine (LTG 200) or 600 mg/day carbamazepine (CBZ) (<LINK REF="STD-Reunanen-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Reunanen 1996</LINK>). <LINK REF="TBL-05" TYPE="TABLE">Table 5</LINK> shows a sensitivity analysis comparing the primary analysis (LTG arms pooled versus CBZ), LTG 100 with the other arms in the trial, LTG 200 with the other arms in the trial, LTG 200 versus CBZ and LTG 100 versus CBZ. When including these alternative estimates in meta-analysis, the pooled result is numerically similar and the conclusions unchanged.</P>
<P>We indirectly estimated aggregate hazard ratios of time to withdrawal of allocated treatment due to adverse events (<LINK REF="STD-Gilad-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Gilad 2007</LINK>), time to early termination (<LINK REF="STD-Rowan-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Rowan 2005</LINK>), and retention time (<LINK REF="STD-Steinhoff-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Steinhoff 2005</LINK>), and we extracted a published hazard ratio for time to all-cause withdrawal (<LINK REF="STD-Saetre-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Saetre 2007</LINK>). We note that these definitions do not directly correspond to our definition of treatment withdrawal (i.e. all withdrawals are classed as events rather than only treatment-related withdrawals, see <LINK REF="TBL-04" TYPE="TABLE">Table 4</LINK>). Combining all IPD and aggregate data, the pooled HR for 3391 participants from the 13 included trials was 0.69(95% CI 0.61 to 0.77, P value &lt; 0.00001) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>). This indicates that the advantage to lamotrigine over carbamazepine remains and is robust to the inclusion of withdrawal data of variable definitions.</P>
<P>Given the subjective nature of the outcome of time to treatment withdrawal, an outcome which can be influenced by the participant and personnel, we conducted a further subgroup analysis separating the trials that were of a double-blind design (<LINK REF="STD-Brodie-1995-A" TYPE="STUDY">Brodie 1995 A</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Brodie-1995-B" TYPE="STUDY">Brodie 1995 B</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Brodie-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Brodie 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rowan-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Rowan 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Saetre-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Saetre 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Werhahn-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Werhahn 2015</LINK>, 1231 participants included in analyses) and those which were an open-label design (<LINK REF="STD-Eun-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Eun 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gilad-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Gilad 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lee-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Lee 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nieto_x002d_Barrera-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Nieto-Barrera 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Reunanen-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Reunanen 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Steinhoff-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Steinhoff 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-SANAD-A-2007" TYPE="STUDY">SANAD A 2007</LINK>, 2160 participants included in analyses).

<LI>In the open-label trials 313 out of 1246 (25%) randomised participants withdrew from lamotrigine and 318 out of 914 (35%) withdrew from carbamazepine (in total 29% of participants withdrew from the randomised drug).</LI>

</UL>
<P>These results suggest that the design of a trial (i.e. whether or not a participant and their clinician is aware of the treatment a participant is taking) may influence the withdrawal rates of the trial, with participants significantly more likely to withdraw from a double-blind trial than an open-label trial (45% versus 29%: risk ratio (RR) 1.48 (95% CI 1.34 to 1.62, P value &lt; 0.0001)), and in turn this may influence the perceived effectiveness of the two drugs under comparison.</P>
<P>Following reclassification of 152 individuals from seven trials with potentially misclassified generalised onset seizures (<LINK REF="STD-Brodie-1995-A" TYPE="STUDY">Brodie 1995 A</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Brodie-1995-B" TYPE="STUDY">Brodie 1995 B</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Brodie-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Brodie 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lee-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Lee 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nieto_x002d_Barrera-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Nieto-Barrera 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Reunanen-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Reunanen 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-SANAD-A-2007" TYPE="STUDY">SANAD A 2007</LINK>), and 85 individuals with missing seizure type from one trial (<LINK REF="STD-SANAD-A-2007" TYPE="STUDY">SANAD A 2007</LINK>), the results of the two sensitivity analyses are shown in <LINK REF="TBL-06" TYPE="TABLE">Table 6</LINK>. In summary, the results overall by seizure type and for individuals with partial onset seizures are very similar. Also, following reclassification, the advantage for lamotrigine over carbamazepine in those with generalised onset seizures is reduced and the test of difference between subgroups is no longer significant. There is a statistically significant advantage for lamotrigine over carbamazepine in those with uncertain seizure type.</P>

<P>Data from <LINK REF="STD-Nieto_x002d_Barrera-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Nieto-Barrera 2001</LINK> could not be included for this outcome as the dates of seizures that occurred during the first four weeks of the trial were not supplied. A total of 216 participants (lamotrigine 160, carbamazepine 56) (35% of the number in the trial) experienced at least one seizure during the first four weeks, however dates of these seizures were not supplied. Therefore, for <LINK REF="STD-Nieto_x002d_Barrera-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Nieto-Barrera 2001</LINK>, this outcome is calculated as 'time to first seizure after four weeks of treatment' rather than 'time to first seizure after randomisation'. Excluding this trial in sensitivity analysis produces very similar numerical results and the conclusions are unchanged <I>

</P>
<P>One included trial allocated participants to three treatment arms: 100 mg/day lamotrigine (LTG100), 200 mg/day lamotrigine (LTG 200) or 600 mg/day carbamazepine (CBZ) (<LINK REF="STD-Reunanen-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Reunanen 1996</LINK>). <LINK REF="TBL-05" TYPE="TABLE">Table 5</LINK> shows sensitivity analysis comparing the primary analysis (LTG arms pooled versus CBZ), LTG 100 with the other arms in the trial, LTG 200 with the other arms in the trial, LTG 200 versus CBZ and LTG 100 versus CBZ. When including these alternative estimates in meta-analysis, the pooled result is numerically similar and the conclusions unchanged.</P>
<P>We indirectly estimated aggregate hazard ratios of time to first seizure from published graphs in two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Gilad-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Gilad 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rowan-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Rowan 2005</LINK>), and extracted a published hazard ratio of time to first seizure (<LINK REF="STD-Saetre-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Saetre 2007</LINK>). We were unable to estimate or extract an estimate from <LINK REF="STD-Steinhoff-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Steinhoff 2005</LINK>. Combining all IPD and aggregate data, the pooled HR for 3216 participants from the 12 included trials was HR 1.24 (95% CI 1.12 to 1.37, P value &lt; 0.00001) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.07" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.7</LINK>).

<P>We were able to calculate or extract seizure freedom throughout the whole trial for all trials included in this review (<LINK REF="STD-Rowan-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Rowan 2005</LINK> did not state whether any participants who withdrew experienced seizure recurrence, therefore we have conducted an intention-to-treat analysis of seizure freedom rather than seizure recurrence). For consistency with the primary analysis of the outcome, in <LINK REF="CMP-001.08" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.8</LINK> we have swapped event and non-event so that a RR less than 1 indicates a clinical advantage for lamotrigine.</P>
<P>The pooled RR of seizure freedom (for 3358 participants from 13 trials) is RR 1.13 (95% CI 1.06 to 1.20, P value = 0.0003), indicating a statistically significant advantage to carbamazepine. Therefore, following the inclusion of seizure freedom/recurrence data from all included trials, the advantage to carbamazepine remains. There is now a large amount of heterogeneity present between the trials, which was not present in the IPD meta-analysis (I<SUP>2</SUP> =55%, <LINK REF="CMP-001.08" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.8</LINK>). This may reflect the variable follow-up lengths of the trials (from 24 weeks to over six years), or may reflect the way the aggregate data are presented in some of the trials; for example <LINK REF="STD-Rowan-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Rowan 2005</LINK> presents seizure freedom rates for those who have completed the trial.</P>
<P>Following reclassification of 152 individuals from seven trials with potentially misclassified generalised onset seizures (<LINK REF="STD-Brodie-1995-A" TYPE="STUDY">Brodie 1995 A</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Brodie-1995-B" TYPE="STUDY">Brodie 1995 B</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Brodie-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Brodie 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lee-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Lee 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nieto_x002d_Barrera-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Nieto-Barrera 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Reunanen-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Reunanen 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-SANAD-A-2007" TYPE="STUDY">SANAD A 2007</LINK>), and 85 individuals with missing seizure type from one trial (<LINK REF="STD-SANAD-A-2007" TYPE="STUDY">SANAD A 2007</LINK>), the results of the two sensitivity analyses are shown in <LINK REF="TBL-06" TYPE="TABLE">Table 6</LINK>. In summary, the results overall by seizure type and for individuals with partial onset seizures are very similar. Following reclassification, there is a slight advantage to carbamazepine, which is not statistically significant, for those with generalised onset seizures. For those with uncertain seizure type, there is a slight advantage to lamotrigine that is not statistically significant.</P>

<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Lee-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Lee 2011</LINK> (analysis adjusted for epilepsy type), there was some evidence that the proportional hazards assumption of the Cox model may have been violated; the P value of the time-varying covariate was 0.051. However, the time varying covariate is not significant in the analysis without adjustment for seizure type (P value = 0.146).</P>
<P>Following visual inspection of a cumulative incidence plot (not shown but available from the authors), the curves appear to cross around 200 days, when less than 20% of randomised participants remain at risk in the trial. Therefore, we conclude that the crossing of the curves is likely to be due to small numbers of participants with generalised seizure types and small numbers remaining in the trial leading to changes and events being magnified at this time.

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-07-11 10:58:13 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The results of this review provide statistically significant evidence of an advantage for lamotrigine over carbamazepine for our primary global effectiveness outcome, time to withdrawal of allocated treatment. For 2569 participants providing individual participant data (IPD) from nine trials, the pooled hazard ratio (HR) was 0.72(95% confidence interval (CI) 0.63 to 0.82, P value &lt; 0.0001). This advantage was also present in the 2182 participants with partial onset seizures (pooled HR 0.75, 95% CI 0.64 to 0.86, P value = 0.0001) and the 299 participants with generalised onset seizures (pooled HR 0.46, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.71, P value = 0.0003) from the nine trials providing IPD.</P>
<P>The advantage also remained when incorporating aggregate data from four trials for which IPD were not available, allowing for alternative definitions of treatment withdrawal from the definition used in this review (<LINK REF="REF-ILAE-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">ILAE 1998</LINK>), and allowing for blinded trial design.</P>
<P>The results of this review provide statistically significant evidence of an advantage for carbamazepine over lamotrigine for our secondary efficacy outcomes, time to first seizure (pooled HR for 2564 participants, 1.22, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.37, P value = 0.0004) and time to six-month remission (pooled HR for 1793 participants, 0.84, 95% CI 0.74 to 0.94, P value =0.003). As above, this advantage was present in the subgroup of participants with partial onset seizures, but in the smaller subgroup of participants with generalised onset seizures we found no significant difference between the drugs.</P>
<P>We found no statistically significant difference between the drugs for the longer-term outcomes of time to 12-month remission and time to 24-month remission; however fewer data were available for inclusion in analyses at these time points due to the short duration of most included trials.</P>
<P>The most commonly reported adverse events for both of the drugs across all of the included trials were dizziness, fatigue, gastrointestinal disturbances, headache and skin problems. The rate of adverse events and serious adverse events was similar across the two drugs.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2016-07-11 10:58:13 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We believe that our systematic electronic searches identified all relevant evidence for this review. We have gratefully received individual participant data (IPD) for 2572 individuals (76% of 3394 individuals from all eligible trials) from the authors or sponsors of nine trials (<LINK REF="STD-Brodie-1995-A" TYPE="STUDY">Brodie 1995 A</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Brodie-1995-B" TYPE="STUDY">Brodie 1995 B</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Brodie-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Brodie 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Eun-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Eun 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lee-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Lee 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nieto_x002d_Barrera-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Nieto-Barrera 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Reunanen-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Reunanen 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-SANAD-A-2007" TYPE="STUDY">SANAD A 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Werhahn-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Werhahn 2015</LINK>), which included a comparison of lamotrigine with carbamazepine for the treatment of epilepsy.</P>
<P>At the time of review, we have not been able to obtain IPD for the remaining four included trials with a total of 822 participants. For two trials including 360 individuals (<LINK REF="STD-Saetre-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Saetre 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Steinhoff-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Steinhoff 2005</LINK>), the trial sponsor confirmed that data could not be made available. For the other two trials, we made contact with the authors/sponsors who expressed interest in collaborating in this IPD meta-analysis but at the time of writing, no data had been received (<LINK REF="STD-Gilad-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Gilad 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rowan-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Rowan 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>If IPD are received from these trials, we will include the data in future updates. We were able to extract aggregate data from all four trial publications to include in meta-analysis for our primary outcome of 'time to treatment withdrawal,' resulting in a similar pooled estimate to that from IPD only. Therefore, we do not believe that our failure to obtain IPD from 24% of eligible participants from four trials has had a large impact on the applicability of the results of the review. We do, however, encourage caution when interpreting the numerical results of the review, particularly longer-term remission outcomes for which only two trials were of sufficient duration. Given the results of this meta-analysis it could be that, compared to carbamazepine, the initial doses of lamotrigine chosen were too low. Hence lamotrigine fared better for treatment withdrawal as the dose chosen caused comparatively fewer side effects but was less effective at preventing seizures. This highlights the importance of measuring longer-term seizure outcomes such as time to one- or two-year remission from seizures, which would be much less affected by initial drug titration and initial target doses.</P>
<P>We have good evidence from previous reviews conducted by the Cochrane Epilepsy Group that misclassification of seizure type, particularly generalised seizure types, is an important issue in epilepsy trials (<LINK REF="REF-Nolan-2013b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nolan 2013b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nolan-2015a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nolan 2015a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nolan-2015b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nolan 2015b</LINK>). It is also likely in this review that a large proportion of individuals who were classified as experiencing generalised onset seizures at baseline had their seizure type wrongly classified, meaning that the results of the original trials and therefore the results of this review may have been confounded by classification bias. Following sensitivity analyses to account for this potential misclassification, the overall conclusions for our primary and secondary outcomes were not changed (see <LINK TAG="SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS" TYPE="SECTION">Summary of main results</LINK>). However, due to the small proportion of total participants included experiencing generalised onset seizures (302 out of 2572, 12% of total participants) and up to 50% of those participants with potentially misclassified seizure type, the results of this review are primarily applicable to participants with partial onset seizures.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2016-07-11 10:58:17 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The nine trials for which IPD were made available (as well as additional trial design information from trial authors/sponsors) were of generally good quality. Less information was available for trials without IPD available where risk of bias assessments were made only based on published information. Six trials were of a double-blind design (<LINK REF="STD-Brodie-1995-A" TYPE="STUDY">Brodie 1995 A</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Brodie-1995-B" TYPE="STUDY">Brodie 1995 B</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Brodie-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Brodie 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rowan-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Rowan 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Saetre-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Saetre 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Werhahn-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Werhahn 2015</LINK>), and seven trials were of an open-label design (<LINK REF="STD-Eun-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Eun 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gilad-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Gilad 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lee-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Lee 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nieto_x002d_Barrera-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Nieto-Barrera 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Reunanen-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Reunanen 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Steinhoff-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Steinhoff 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-SANAD-A-2007" TYPE="STUDY">SANAD A 2007</LINK>). The results of this review suggest that the design of a trial (double-blind versus open-label) may influence the withdrawal rates of the trial, an outcome that is subjective and can be influenced by the participant or clinician. It is argued that an open-label design is more pragmatic and reflective of 'real world' treatment for a trial of a chronic condition such as epilepsy where treatments are likely to be taken long-term by participants (<LINK REF="STD-SANAD-A-2007" TYPE="STUDY">SANAD A 2007</LINK>), and it is shown in this review that a significantly higher proportion of participants withdrew from treatment in the trials with a double-blind design compared to the open-label trials (45% versus 29%, P value &lt; 0.0001, see <LINK TAG="INTERVENTION_EFFECTS" TYPE="SECTION">Effects of interventions</LINK>). However, in a trial of a 'new' compared to a 'standard' intervention, knowledge of the treatment allocation may influence the choice of the participant or clinician to continue taking the treatment, which may then influence the perceived effectiveness of the two drugs under comparison. Therefore, we have considered an open-label design to potentially introduce bias into the results for the subjective outcomes of time to treatment withdrawal, but not for the objective secondary outcomes of time to first seizure and remission.</P>
<P>Due to this potential risk of bias from an open-label design, we have rated the evidence provided in this review according to Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) criteria for our primary outcome of time to treatment withdrawal as 'moderate' for all participants and the subgroup of participants with partial onset seizures. Due to the limited number of participants with generalised onset seizures (and potential misclassification of seizure type), we have rated this evidence as low quality for the primary outcome(see <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>).</P>
<P>For our secondary (objective) outcomes of time to first seizure and remission, we have rated the evidence as high quality (moderate quality in the subgroup of generalised onset seizures for the reasons stated above)(see <LINK REF="SOF-02" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 2</LINK>).</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2016-07-11 10:58:23 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We were able to include individual participant data (IPD) for 2572 out of 3394 eligible participants (76%) from nine out of 13 trials in this review and we were able to analyse all outcomes using IPD. Such an approach has many advantages, such as allowing the standardisation of definitions of outcomes across trials, and attrition and reporting biases are reduced as we can perform additional analyses and calculate additional outcomes from unpublished data. For the outcomes we used in this review that are of a time-to-event nature, an IPD approach is considered to be the 'gold standard' approach to analysis (<LINK REF="REF-Parmar-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parmar 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>For reasons outside of our control, we were unable to obtain IPD for 822 participants from four trials for inclusion in this review. However, following sensitivity analyses using aggregate data, we do not believe that the exclusion of 24% of eligible participants is likely to have impacted on the conclusions of this review (see <LINK TAG="APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS" TYPE="SECTION">Overall completeness and applicability of evidence</LINK>).</P>
<P>Finally, we made some assumptions in the statistical methodology used in this review. Firstly, when we received only follow-up dates and seizure frequencies, we used linear interpolation to estimate. We are aware that an individual's seizure patterns may be non-linear; therefore, we recommend caution when interpreting the numerical results of the seizure-related outcomes.</P>
<P>We also made an assumption that treatment effect for each outcome did not change over time (proportional hazards assumption, see <LINK TAG="DATA_SYNTHESIS" TYPE="SECTION">Data synthesis</LINK>). We are aware that in trials of long duration (e.g. <LINK REF="STD-SANAD-A-2007" TYPE="STUDY">SANAD A 2007</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Werhahn-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Werhahn 2015</LINK> of over one year duration), the assumption of treatment effect remaining constant over time is unlikely to be appropriate, for example, there is likely to be a difference between participants who achieve immediate remission compared with participants who achieve later remission. Therefore, if future updates of this review include more trials of long duration, we would like to perform statistical analyses that allow for treatment effects to vary over time.</P>

<P>To our knowledge, together with previous versions of this review, this is the only systematic review and meta-analysis that compares lamotrigine and carbamazepine monotherapy for partial onset seizures and generalised onset tonic-clonic seizures. A network meta-analysis has been published (<LINK REF="REF-Tudur-Smith-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tudur Smith 2007</LINK>), comparing all direct and indirect evidence from lamotrigine, carbamazepine and other standard and new antiepileptic drugs licensed for monotherapy. The results of this review generally agree with the results of the network meta-analysis. The network meta-analysis is currently being updated to include more recently published trials, such as <LINK REF="STD-SANAD-A-2007" TYPE="STUDY">SANAD A 2007</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Werhahn-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Werhahn 2015</LINK>; therefore, we will compare the results of this review with the updated network meta-analysis.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2016-07-11 10:58:30 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Current UK guidelines recommend carbamazepine or lamotrigine as first-line treatment for adults and children with new onset partial seizures and sodium valproate for adults and children with new onset generalised seizures (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2012</LINK>).</P>
<P>For individuals with new onset partial seizures, the results of this review suggest that lamotrigine is likely to be a more effective drug than carbamazepine in terms of treatment retention (withdrawals due to lack of efficacy or adverse events or both). However, the results also suggest that individuals are likely to achieve earlier remission and later seizure recurrence when taking carbamazepine compared to lamotrigine. Therefore a choice between these two first-line treatments for individuals with new onset partial seizures must be carefully considered, taking the personal circumstances of an individual into account.</P>
<P>For individuals with new onset generalised seizures, the evidence in the review is limited due to small numbers of participants with certain generalised seizure types recruited into the included trials. There is evidence that carbamazepine may exacerbate some generalised seizure types so should be used with caution in individuals with this seizure type (<LINK REF="REF-Liporace-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liporace 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shields-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shields 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Snead-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Snead 1985</LINK>). Lamotrigine may be an effective treatment option for new onset generalised seizures, but more evidence is required to confirm this.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2016-07-11 10:58:30 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review highlights the need for the design of future antiepileptic drug monotherapy trials that recruit individuals with specific epilepsy syndromes to be powered to detect a difference between particular antiepileptic drugs. An approach likely to reflect and inform clinical practice, as well as being statistically powerful, would be to recruit heterogeneous populations for whom epilepsy syndromes have been adequately defined, with testing for interaction between treatment and epilepsy syndrome. In view of potential problems of misclassification, syndromes will have to be well defined, with adequate checking mechanisms to ensure that classifications are accurate and a system to recognise uncertainty surrounding epilepsy syndromes in individuals within trials. It is also important that future trials are of a sufficient duration to measure long-term effectiveness of antiepileptic drugs(treatments that will be life-long for many individuals with epilepsy), as well as psychosocial, quality of life and health economic outcomes.</P>
<P>Consideration is also required in the design of a trial regarding whether to blind participants and outcome assessors to treatment allocation. While an open-label design is a more pragmatic and practical approach for large, long-term trials, when trials involve a new intervention compared to an established 'standard' intervention, masking of treatment may be important to avoid preconceptions over the relative effectiveness of the drugs.</P>
<P>The choice of outcomes at the design stage of a trial and the presentation of the results of outcomes, particularly of a time-to-event nature, require very careful consideration. While the majority of trials of a monotherapy design record an outcome measuring efficacy (seizure control) and an outcome measuring tolerability (adverse events), there is little uniformity between the definition of the outcomes and the reporting of the summary statistics related to the outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-Nolan-2013a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nolan 2013a</LINK>), making an aggregate data approach to meta-analysis in reviews of monotherapy trials impossible. Where trial authors cannot or will not make individual participant data available for analysis, we are left with no choice but to exclude a proportion of relevant evidence from the review, which may impact upon the interpretation of the results of the review and the applicability of the evidence and conclusions. The International League Against Epilepsy recommends that trials of a monotherapy design should adopt a primary effectiveness outcome of 'time to withdrawal of allocated treatment (retention time)' and should be of a duration of at least 48 weeks to allow for assessment of longer-term outcomes, such as remission (<LINK REF="REF-ILAE-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">ILAE 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-ILAE-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">ILAE 2006</LINK>). If trials followed these recommendations, an aggregate data approach to meta-analysis may be feasible, reducing the resources and time required from an individual participant data approach.</P>
