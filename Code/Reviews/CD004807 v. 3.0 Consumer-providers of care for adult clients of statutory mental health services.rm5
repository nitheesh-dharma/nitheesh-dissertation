<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2013-03-01 11:59:48 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Past or present consumers of mental health services can work in partnership with mental health professionals in 'consumer-provider' roles, when providing mental health services to others. Their roles may include peer support, coaching, advocacy, specialists or peer interviewers, case management or outreach, crisis worker or assertive community treatment worker, or providing social support programmes. Until now, the effects of employing past or present consumers of mental health services, in providing services to adult clients of these services, have not been assessed rigorously.</P>
<P>We conducted a systematic review, comprehensively searching databases and other materials to identify <A HREF="http://www.cochrane.org/glossary/5#term372">randomised controlled trials</A> which involved past or present consumers of mental health services employed as providers of mental healthcare services for adult clients. To be included, studies had to make one of two comparisons: 1) consumer-providers versus professionals employed to do the same role within a mental health service, or 2) mental health services with and without consumer-providers as an adjunct to the service.</P>
<P>We found 11 randomised controlled trials involving approximately 2796 people. The quality of the evidence is moderate to low; it was unclear in many cases whether steps were taken to minimise bias, both in the way that participants were allocated to groups, and in how the outcomes were assessed and reported.</P>
<P>Five of the 11 trials involving 581 people compared consumer-providers to professionals who occupied similar roles within mental health services (case management roles (4 trials), and facilitating group therapy (1 trial)). There were no significant differences between the two groups, in terms of client (care recipient) quality of life, mental health symptoms, satisfaction, use of mental health services, or on the numbers of people withdrawing from the study. People receiving care from past or present users of mental health services used crisis and emergency services slightly less than those receiving care from professional staff. Past or present consumers who provided mental health services did so differently than professionals; they spent more time face-to-face with clients, and less time in the office, on the telephone, with clients' friends and family, or at provider agencies.</P>
<P>Six of the 11 trials, involving 2215 people, compared mental health services with or without the addition of consumer-providers. There were no significant differences in quality of life, empowerment, function and social relations, in client satisfaction, attendance rates, hospital use, or in the numbers of people withdrawing from the study, between groups with consumer-providers as an adjunct to professional care and those receiving usual care by health professionals alone. None of these six studies reported on clients' mental health symptoms. None of the studies reported on adverse outcomes (harms) for clients, or on the costs of providing the services.</P>
<P>Overall, we concluded that employing past or present consumers of mental health services as providers of mental health services achieves psychosocial, mental health symptom and service use outcomes that are no better or worse than those achieved by professional staff in providing care.<BR/>
</P>
<P>There is no evidence that the involvement of consumer-providers is harmful. More high-quality and well-reported randomised trials are needed, particularly to evaluate mental health outcomes, adverse outcomes for clients, the potential benefits and harms to the consumer-providers themselves (including a need to return to treatment), and whether it is cost-effective to employ them. Future researchers should include a clear description of the consumer-provider role and relevant training for the role so that it can be readily implemented, and should investigate consumer-providers in settings outside the United States.</P>

<P>In mental health services, the past several decades has seen a slow but steady trend towards employment of past or present consumers of the service to work alongside mental health professionals in providing services.

<P>We conducted a systematic review of randomised trials assessing the effects of employing consumers of mental health services as providers of statutory mental health services to clients. In this review this role is called 'consumer-provider' and the term 'statutory mental health services' refers to public services, those required by statute or law, or public services involving statutory duties.

<P>Randomised controlled trials of current or past consumers of mental health services employed as providers ('consumer-providers') in statutory mental health services, comparing either: 1) consumers versus professionals employed to do the same role within a mental health service, or 2) mental health services with and without consumer-providers as an adjunct to the service.</P>

<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2013-02-13 16:03:07 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two review authors independently selected studies and extracted data. We contacted trialists for additional information. We conducted analyses using a random-effects model, pooling studies that measured the same outcome to provide a summary estimate of the effect across studies. We describe findings for each outcome in the text of the review with considerations of the potential impact of bias and the clinical importance of results, with input from a clinical expert.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-02-13 16:50:31 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Megan Prictor">
<P>We included 11 randomised controlled trials involving 2796 people. The quality of these studies was moderate to low, with most of the studies at unclear risk of bias in terms of random sequence generation and allocation concealment, and high risk of bias for blinded outcome assessment and selective outcome reporting.</P>
<P>Five trials involving 581 people compared consumer-providers to professionals in similar roles within mental health services (case management roles (4 trials), facilitating group therapy (1 trial)). There were no significant differences in client quality of life (mean difference (MD) -0.30, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.80 to 0.20); depression (data not pooled), general mental health symptoms (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.24, 95% CI -0.52 to 0.05); client satisfaction with treatment (SMD -0.22, 95% CI -0.69 to 0.25), client or professional ratings of client-manager relationship; use of mental health services, hospital admissions and length of stay; or attrition (risk ratio 0.80, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.09) between mental health teams involving consumer-providers or professional staff in similar roles.</P>
<P>There was a small reduction in crisis and emergency service use for clients receiving care involving consumer-providers (SMD -0.34 (95%CI -0.60 to -0.07). Past or present consumers who provided mental health services did so differently than professionals; they spent more time face-to-face with clients, and less time in the office, on the telephone, with clients' friends and family, or at provider agencies.</P>
<P>Six trials involving 2215 people compared mental health services with or without the addition of consumer-providers. There were no significant differences in psychosocial outcomes (quality of life, empowerment, function, social relations), client satisfaction with service provision (SMD 0.76, 95% CI -0.59 to 2.10) and with staff (SMD 0.18, 95% CI -0.43 to 0.79), attendance rates (SMD 0.52 (95% CI -0.07 to 1.11), hospital admissions and length of stay, or attrition (risk ratio 1.29, 95% CI 0.72 to 2.31) between groups with consumer-providers as an adjunct to professional-led care and those receiving usual care from health professionals alone. One study found a small difference favouring the intervention group for both client and staff ratings of clients' needs having been met, although detection bias may have affected the latter. None of the six studies in this comparison reported client mental health outcomes.</P>
<P>No studies in either comparison group reported data on adverse outcomes for clients, or the financial costs of service provision.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2013-03-01 11:57:16 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Megan Prictor">
<P>Involving consumer-providers in mental health teams results in psychosocial, mental health symptom and service use outcomes for clients that were no better or worse than those achieved by professionals employed in similar roles, particularly for case management services.<BR/>
</P>
<P>There is low quality evidence that involving consumer-providers in mental health teams results in a small reduction in clients' use of crisis or emergency services. The nature of the consumer-providers' involvement differs compared to professionals, as do the resources required to support their involvement. The overall quality of the evidence is moderate to low. There is no evidence of harm associated with involving consumer-providers in mental health teams.</P>
<P>Future randomised controlled trials of consumer-providers in mental health services should minimise bias through the use of adequate randomisation and concealment of allocation, blinding of outcome assessment where possible, the comprehensive reporting of outcome data, and the avoidance of contamination between treatment groups. Researchers should adhere to SPIRIT and CONSORT reporting standards for clinical trials.</P>
<P>Future trials should further evaluate standardised measures of clients' mental health, adverse outcomes for clients, the potential benefits and harms to the consumer-providers themselves (including need to return to treatment), and the financial costs of the intervention. They should utilise consistent, validated measurement tools and include a clear description of the consumer-provider role (eg specific tasks, responsibilities and expected deliverables of the role) and relevant training for the role so that it can be readily implemented. The weight of evidence being strongly based in the United States, future research should be located in diverse settings including in low- and middle-income countries.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Terms used in this review</HEADING>
<P>In mental health services, the last 30 to 40 years has seen a slow but steady trend towards employment of past or present consumers of the service to work alongside mental health professionals. In this review, we call this role 'consumer-provider', and use the term 'statutory mental health services' to refer to public services, those required by statute or law, or public services which involve statutory duties (i.e. specific duties required by law). In <LINK REF="APP-01" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 1</LINK> we define key terms for this review, and describe our rationale for the choice of the term 'consumer-provider'. We also explain the issues associated with the use of other terms (eg service users, survivors, peers).</P>
<P>The role of consumer-providers can encompass peer support (<LINK REF="REF-Davidson-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davidson 2012</LINK>), coaching, advocacy, case management or outreach roles, crisis worker or assertive community treatment team, or providing clinical or social support programmes (<LINK REF="REF-Mowbray-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mowbray 1998</LINK>). Past or present clients of mental health services can play other roles, such as providing a wholly consumer-run or operated service (<LINK REF="STD-Segal-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Segal 2011</LINK>), including self-help groups (<LINK REF="REF-Segal-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Segal 1995</LINK>) (sometimes known as consumer-operated service providers (COSPs)) but our review does not assess this form of intervention. Nor does this review examine the role of consumers as trainers for professionals providing mental health services, or as researchers designing or conducting service evaluations (<LINK REF="REF-Coulter-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Coulter 2011</LINK>); both of these interventions are important, however, and are the subject of companion reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Simpson-2003a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Simpson 2003a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Simpson-2003b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Simpson 2003b</LINK>).</P>
<P>The protocol for this review was written by Emma Simpson and colleagues (<LINK REF="REF-Simpson-2003c" TYPE="REFERENCE">Simpson 2003c</LINK>) but they were unable to complete the review. The current authors completed the review using the scope of the original protocol because this is the standard expected of Cochrane reviews (see <LINK TAG="ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS" TYPE="SECTION">Acknowledgements</LINK>). Referees of the review identified the need for a review of the evidence of user-controlled consumer services, as well as an evaluation of the impact of service provision on consumer-providers themselves, but these topics could not be assessed by this current review.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">User involvement in mental health services</HEADING>
<P>The consumer participation and self-help movements have driven an increase in user involvement in mental health services, since at least the 1970s (<LINK REF="REF-Doughty-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Doughty 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wright_x002d_Berryman-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wright-Berryman 2011</LINK>). Providers of mental health services, like other health service providers, increasingly involve service users. Health policies often recommend the involvement of users in services, for example the United Kingdom (UK) Department of Health has an emphasis on patient and public involvement (<LINK REF="REF-Department-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Department 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Department-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Department 2001</LINK>). Legislation also now may require such involvement (<LINK REF="REF-Campbell-2008a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Campbell 2008a</LINK>); an example is the UK <I>Health and Social Care Act </I>2001. User involvement is often seen as intrinsically worthwhile (<LINK REF="REF-van-Vugt-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Vugt 2012</LINK>), but it can also have measurable effects (positive or negative) on client and service outcomes.</P>
<P>Despite encouragement of user involvement in service planning in Western Europe and North America, there are few rigorous assessments of its effects (<LINK REF="REF-Crawford-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Crawford 2002</LINK>). Users have been involved as consumer-providers internationally, including in the UK, Australia, the United States of America (USA) and Canada (<LINK REF="REF-Church-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Church 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mowbray-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mowbray 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Donnell-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Donnell 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Perkins-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Perkins 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Salzer-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Salzer 2010</LINK>). Data are limited on how widespread this practice is (<LINK REF="REF-Crawford-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Crawford 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Geller-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Geller 1998</LINK>), but there are indications that the consumer-provider workforce is growing (<LINK REF="REF-Salzer-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Salzer 2010</LINK>), spurred, for instance, by government funding and advocacy organisation support for service provision by peers (<LINK REF="STD-Segal-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Segal 2011</LINK>). The 2003 USA report of the President's New Freedom Commission on Mental Health (<LINK REF="REF-President-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">President 2003</LINK>) helped to stimulate powerfully the "transformation of mental health services to a recovery orientation", in which consumer involvement is considered to be central.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">How the intervention might work</HEADING>
<P>This review assesses partnership approaches to service provision in the context of mental health, where service users work in partnership with mental health professionals in consumer-provider roles integrated within statutory mental health services. Users can be involved as consumer-providers within adult mental health services in a variety of ways. They can be employed in roles specifically designated for them, such as peer support specialists or peer interviewers (<LINK REF="REF-Lecomte-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lecomte 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mowbray-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mowbray 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Salzer-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Salzer 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pfeiffer-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pfeiffer 2011</LINK>). Users can also be appointed to roles that apply to both users or non-users, such as case management or outreach roles (<LINK REF="REF-Fisk-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fisk 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sherman-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sherman 1991</LINK>). Alternatively, user-run programmes may be integrated into the mental health system that are closely linked with professional services, for example user-run drop-in centres (<LINK REF="REF-Brown-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brown 2010</LINK>), or social support programmes for service users discharged from hospital (<LINK REF="REF-Chinman-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chinman 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kaufmann-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kaufmann 1993</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Potential benefits and harms</HEADING>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-van-Vugt-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Vugt 2012</LINK> describes a fundamental belief that "involving consumers improves the health and quality of life of clients". However clients of mental health services can have divergent perceptions of the involvement of consumer-providers. Some clients may prefer to receive services from consumer-providers because they believe it will provide hope, or lead to more patient-centred care, better understanding, or empathy with their condition (<LINK REF="REF-Chinman-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chinman 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-van-Vugt-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Vugt 2012</LINK>). However other clients may prefer to receive care from mental health professionals because they believe they have a greater capacity to meet their health needs (described by <LINK REF="REF-Campbell-2008a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Campbell 2008a</LINK> as a "credibility gap"). Consumer-providers and mental health professionals may also differ in the outcomes they consider important for clients. While health professionals may be interested in therapeutic outcomes such as mental health symptoms, consumer-providers and clients may have a greater interest in their overall quality of life.</P>
<P>Differences in the nature of consumer-provider involvement compared to health professionals may also be important regarding how and where they spend their time and the potential impact this may have on relationships between clients and staff, use of available resources, or job satisfaction for staff (<LINK REF="REF-Salzer-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Salzer 2010</LINK>). Services involving consumer-providers may be seen as more engaging and accessible to clients (<LINK REF="REF-President-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">President 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-van-Vugt-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Vugt 2012</LINK>), and may also be seen as empowering local communities (<LINK REF="STD-Greenfield-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Greenfield 2008</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Why it is important to do this review</HEADING>
<P>Involving consumers in mental health services has the potential to produce a number of benefits but there is also potential for harm. Mechanisms of involving consumer-providers need to be carefully considered, and practice needs to be guided by evidence on effectiveness. Such evidence can be found from comparisons of services provided by consumers with services provided by mental health professionals. We aimed to assess current evidence from randomised controlled trials regarding the benefits and harms for clients of consumer-providers in mental health services. We also aimed to look at service provision patterns when consumers are involved in service delivery.</P>
<P>The current review overlaps with an earlier review (<LINK REF="REF-Simpson-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Simpson 2002</LINK>) of involving consumers as providers of mental health services. The earlier review identified eight trials for inclusion, of which three met our inclusion criteria. The current review updates the section in <LINK REF="REF-Simpson-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Simpson 2002</LINK> on employing users as providers, and additionally uses Cochrane systematic review methods.</P>
<P>A number of related Cochrane reviews exist. The most relevant is the planned review <LINK REF="REF-Van-Ginneken-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van Ginneken 2011</LINK>, which will examine the effects of non-specialist health workers (NSHWs) such as doctors, nurses and lay providers, and professionals with other health roles (such as teachers and community workers) for providing mental health care in low and middle income countries. The main distinctions between <LINK REF="REF-Van-Ginneken-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van Ginneken 2011</LINK> and the present review are the intervention provider and setting; we focus only on current or past clients of mental health services, as providers, and van Ginneken focuses only on low and middle income country settings. <LINK REF="REF-Nilsen-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nilsen 2006</LINK> examines the involvement of consumers in health policy and research, guideline development and patient information materials, but not in service provision. <LINK REF="REF-Dale-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dale 2008</LINK> assessed care provided by peers via telephone and found that it can be effective for certain health-related concerns; some of the included studies assessed peer supporters versus healthcare professionals as callers, whilst others assessed peer support callers versus usual care (no telephone call). <LINK REF="REF-Lewin-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lewin 2010</LINK> examines lay health workers in primary and community health care for improving maternal and child health and the management of infectious diseases.</P>
<P>This review is one of a suite of three reviews designed to assess different aspects of consumer involvement in mental health services, namely service provision, research (<LINK REF="REF-Simpson-2003a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Simpson 2003a</LINK>) and training (<LINK REF="REF-Simpson-2003b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Simpson 2003b</LINK>).</P>

<EFFECT_MEASURES MODIFIED="2013-03-01 14:53:32 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Megan Prictor">
<P>Based on the <LINK TAG="SELECTION_CRITERIA" TYPE="SECTION">Criteria for considering studies for this review</LINK>, we identified two possible pairwise comparisons for this review:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Comparison 1: Studies comparing the effect of having a consumer-provider in a role that would otherwise be occupied by a professional in a mental health service (consumer-provider versus professional staff); and</LI>
<LI>Comparison 2: Studies comparing the effect of involving a consumer-provider in addition to the usual mental health service (usual care plus a consumer-provider as adjunct versus usual care).</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK> depicts these comparisons graphically.</P>
<P>We did not anticipate in advance there would be sufficient homogeneity of interventions and outcome measures to warrant meta-analysis. However we found that several studies did report similar outcome measures, and we have presented pooled analyses wherever appropriate, as well as presenting individual study results using <A HREF="http://www.cochrane.org/glossary/5#letterf">forest plots</A> wherever sufficient data were available to do so.</P>
<P>For dichotomous outcomes, we analysed data based on the number of events and the number of people assessed in the intervention and comparison groups. We used the Mantel-Haenszel method (<A HREF="http://www.cochrane.org/glossary/5#letterr">random-effects model</A>) to calculate the <A HREF="http://www.cochrane.org/glossary/5#letterr">risk ratio</A> (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI).</P>
<P>For continuous measures, we analysed data based on the mean, <A HREF="http://www.cochrane.org/glossary/5#letters">standard deviation</A> (SD) and number of people assessed for both the intervention and comparison groups to calculate <A HREF="http://www.cochrane.org/glossary/5#letterm">mean difference</A> (MD) and 95% CI. If more than one study measured the same outcome using different tools, we calculated the <A HREF="http://www.cochrane.org/glossary/5#letters">standardised mean difference</A> (SMD) and 95% CI using the inverse variance method in Review Manager 5 (random-effects model). As SMD is not easily interpreted, pooled effect estimates expressed as SMD were back transformed by multiplying the SMD with an SD of a standard instrument used to measure the outcome (ie points on the Hopkins Symptoms Checklist (HSCL)-58 scale). We imputed SD values using the average baseline SD values from the intervention and comparison arms of a trial that used the standard instrument of interest.</P>
<P>Where the same outcome was reported as dichotomous or continuous measures in separate studies (eg crisis/emergency service use), we pooled these outcomes using the generic inverse variance method in Review Manager 5. We calculated the SMD and standard error (SE) for each study (dichotomous outcomes were expressed as an odds ratio (OR) and converted to SMD) using standard formulae described in sections 7.7.7 and 9.4.6 of the <I>Cochrane Handbook</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>).</P>

<P>We attempted to contact study authors for any information we were unable to collect from the published articles we had identified in our search. This included clarification of the involvement of consumer-providers within studies, descriptions of how studies were conducted (eg method of random sequence generation, method of allocating participants to treatment groups), and requesting unpublished data for measured outcomes.</P>
<P>For outcomes assessed using measurement scales (eg quality of life scales, Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale) we presented overall scores wherever possible. If no overall score was provided, we reported results of sub-scales considered to be most relevant to the outcome of interest, as recorded in the Notes section of the <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>.</P>
<P>If the number of people assessed for each outcome was not specified, this was imputed based on the number of people originally randomised to the treatment groups. For continuous measures, we imputed missing SD values based on reported values for standard error multiplied by the square root of the number of people assessed for the outcome. For dichotomous outcomes, percentages were used to impute missing raw data for the number of events or the number of people assessed.

We intended to explore any heterogeneity by referring to the characteristics of individual studies such as the population and type of intervention to try to account for any observed differences in outcomes.

<DATA_SYNTHESIS MODIFIED="2013-01-24 16:26:01 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We calculated estimated effects of the intervention and CIs for all primary and secondary outcomes wherever possible. We anticipated that interventions were likely to be heterogeneous across studies, and therefore we planned to conduct analyses using a random-effects model. If more than one study measured the same outcome, we pooled the results to provide a summary estimate of the effect across studies. We planned to report findings for the different comparison groups separately. For each comparison, we planned to report measures of treatment effect as point estimates with 95% CIs wherever possible, and acknowledge instances where outcomes may have been measured but we were unable to calculate a summary estimate. Where outcomes were measured at multiple time points within individual studies, we have presented outcome data collected at the longest follow up point. We describe findings for each outcome in the text of the review with consideration of the potential impact of bias on the size or direction of the effect. We interpreted results that reached statistical significance with respect to clinical importance based on input from a clinical expert (SEH).</P>

The number of consumer-providers in the included studies ranged from two to nine, with no studies providing a rationale for the number recruited.</P>
<P>The employment history and other relevant experience of consumer-providers was reported only in <LINK REF="STD-Bright-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Bright 1999</LINK> (with half having previously led self-help groups and most holding a bachelor degree) and <LINK REF="STD-Craig-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Craig 2004</LINK> (with consumer-providers having been unemployed for some years at the time of employment) (see <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>). Their diagnoses were reported in <LINK REF="STD-Clarke-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Clarke 2000</LINK> (self-identified mental health consumers with a DSM-III-R axis I diagnosis); <LINK REF="STD-Rivera-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Rivera 2007</LINK> (history of multiple hospitalisations for mood or psychotic disorders, eligible for disability benefits, reliant on medication and having three to eight years of stability in the community); and <LINK REF="STD-Sells-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Sells 2006</LINK> (some had a history of co-occurring drug use disorder).</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Donnell-1999" TYPE="STUDY">O'Donnell 1999</LINK>, those delivering the intervention initially comprised present or past consumers of mental health services, 'secondary' consumers (carers or siblings of primary consumers), or lay individuals.

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Participants and providers</HEADING>
<P>None of the clients or care providers in any of the studies was considered blind to treatment assignment, because disclosure of consumer-provider status was an important part of the intervention. Because the primary outcomes of the review rely largely on self-reported assessments (eg quality of life, function, social interaction, mental health symptoms, and service satisfaction) the clients' beliefs about consumer-providers' effectiveness were likely to have affected their assessment of these outcomes.</P>

<P>Only two (<LINK REF="STD-Bright-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Bright 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rivera-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Rivera 2007</LINK>) of the five studies in Comparison 1 stated that outcome assessors were blind to group assignment. Data reported for service use outcomes (eg hospital admissions, crisis/emergency service) may be subject to detection bias where outcome assessors were not blinded. <LINK REF="STD-Clarke-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Clarke 2000</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Rivera-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Rivera 2007</LINK> both reported data for these outcomes, however <LINK REF="STD-Clarke-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Clarke 2000</LINK> did not blind outcome assessors.</P>
<P>Only one study (<LINK REF="STD-Kaufmann-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Kaufmann 1995</LINK>) in Comparison 2 stated that outcome assessors were unaware of group assignment, but we were unable to obtain data from this study for inclusion in this review. <LINK REF="STD-Craig-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Craig 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gordon-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Gordon 1979</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Sledge-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Sledge 2011</LINK> reported service use data; outcome assessors were not blind to group assignment and had a vested interest in seeing the intervention succeed in these studies.</P>

<P>The five studies in Comparison 1 reported losses to follow up ranging from 6% to 30% of the total participants.

<P>Four of the six studies in Comparison 2 reported minimal losses (ie less than 10%) that were balanced across groups and unlikely to bias outcomes. However, <LINK REF="STD-Rogers-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Rogers 2007</LINK> reported 20.5% of participants were lost to follow up without describing whether losses were balanced across groups; disproportionate losses in either group may have biased outcomes in either direction. In <LINK REF="STD-Sledge-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Sledge 2011</LINK>, 17% of participants withdrew consent post-randomisation (balanced between groups), and while it appears that service use data are reported for all of the remaining participants, the authors note that they did not have verifiable data on whether patients were hospitalised at other facilities during the follow-up period.</P>

The third study, <LINK REF="STD-Rivera-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Rivera 2007</LINK> (130 participants), assessed the effect of consumer-providers within a strengths-based intensive case management team compared to using licensed clinical social workers in the same role. There was no significant difference between groups after 12 months regarding life satisfaction (mean difference (MD) -0.30 (95% CI -0.80 to 0.20) <LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>), daily activities (MD 0.00 (95% CI -0.07 to 0.07) <LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>), or social relations (MD -0.10 (95% CI -0.48 to 0.28) <LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>).

The pooled estimate of effect is -0.24 SMD (95%CI -0.52 to 0.05, P = 0.10) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.4</LINK>) indicating there was no difference in symptoms between the groups. These results are consistent with <LINK REF="STD-Solomon-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Solomon 1995</LINK> which reported no difference between groups in symptoms measured by the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS). Inclusion of the missing data from <LINK REF="STD-Solomon-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Solomon 1995</LINK> in the pooled analysis would probably increase the precision of the results indicating no difference between the groups. It is unlikely that the potential selection bias identified in these studies would have significantly influenced these results.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="6">Depression</HEADING>
<P>One study (<LINK REF="STD-Bright-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Bright 1999</LINK>) measured depression using the Beck Depression Inventory. There was no significant difference in self-reported depression for participants in mutual support group (MSG) therapy led by consumer-providers compared to professional employees (MD 3.61 (95% CI -1.37 to 8.59) <LINK REF="CMP-001.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.5</LINK>.1) however the wide confidence interval means we cannot rule out that some clients of consumer-providers will have higher (worse) scores. For cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), clients of consumer-providers had lower (better) scores for depression, however this difference did not reach statistical significance (MD -5.57 (95% CI -12.90 to 1.76) <LINK REF="CMP-001.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.5</LINK>.1). When providers assessed depression using the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (MSG therapy: MD 2.43 (95%CI -0.58 to 5.44), CBT: MD 1.32 (95%CI -2.26 to 4.90) <LINK REF="CMP-001.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.5</LINK>.2) there was no strong evidence of a clinical difference between the groups. <LINK REF="STD-Solomon-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Solomon 1995</LINK> measured depression as a separate subscale of the BPRS and reported no differences between groups, but did not provide sufficient data to include in a meta-analysis.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Crisis/emergency service use</HEADING>
<P>Three studies compared client use of crisis or emergency services in each of the treatment groups (<LINK REF="STD-Clarke-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Clarke 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rivera-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Rivera 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Solomon-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Solomon 1995</LINK>). Pooled summary estimates of 2-year data from <LINK REF="STD-Clarke-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Clarke 2000</LINK> and 12-month data from <LINK REF="STD-Rivera-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Rivera 2007</LINK> show a small but significant reduction in crisis or emergency service use in clients within the consumer-provider group (SMD -0.34 (95% CI -0.60 to -0.07) P = 0.01) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.14" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.14</LINK>). These findings are based on self-reported use of services collected at 6-monthly (<LINK REF="STD-Clarke-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Clarke 2000</LINK>) or monthly interviews (<LINK REF="STD-Rivera-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Rivera 2007</LINK>). It is unlikely that potential selection bias may have significantly influenced results of these studies, however the accuracy of the results are likely to be affected by the participants' ability to recall their use of services. It is unclear whether participant awareness of treatment allocation in <LINK REF="STD-Clarke-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Clarke 2000</LINK> may have biased this self-reported outcome measure and what direction the bias would be (this could depend on the participant's belief in the capability of the different providers as to whether they are likely to under-report or exaggerate their need for these services).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Solomon-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Solomon 1995</LINK> reported no difference in service use between groups, but did not provide sufficient data to include in a meta-analysis.

<HEADING LEVEL="6">Hospital use</HEADING>
<P>Two studies collected data regarding hospital admission (<LINK REF="STD-Clarke-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Clarke 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Solomon-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Solomon 1995</LINK>). Although fewer people were admitted to hospital in the consumer-provider group in <LINK REF="STD-Clarke-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Clarke 2000</LINK>, this difference did not reach statistical significance and the confidence interval incorporates both increased and decreased risk of admission in the consumer-provider group (RR 0.68 (95% CI 0.45 to 1.03), <LINK REF="CMP-001.15" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.15</LINK>). This finding is based on self-reported recall of hospitalisation at interviews conducted every 6 months for 114 participants who were aware of treatment allocation. Potential selection bias or performance bias did not result in an effect estimate that significantly favours either group.</P>
<P>We were unable to calculate a summary estimate for <LINK REF="STD-Solomon-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Solomon 1995</LINK> which reported no difference between groups. As <LINK REF="STD-Clarke-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Clarke 2000</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Solomon-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Solomon 1995</LINK> both involve similar numbers of participants, incorporating missing data from <LINK REF="STD-Solomon-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Solomon 1995</LINK> in a pooled analysis with <LINK REF="STD-Clarke-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Clarke 2000</LINK> is unlikely to show a significant difference between groups.</P>
<P>Two studies collected information on length of hospital stay. <LINK REF="STD-Rivera-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Rivera 2007</LINK> compared the length of stay for 136 participants and found no significant difference between groups (MD 1.10 (95% CI -0.72 to 2.92), <LINK REF="CMP-001.16" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.16</LINK>). We were unable to calculate a summary estimate for <LINK REF="STD-Solomon-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Solomon 1995</LINK> which reported no significant difference between groups. Depending on the measure of variance in the outcome data of <LINK REF="STD-Solomon-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Solomon 1995</LINK>, it is unclear whether inclusion of this missing data for 96 participants in a pooled analysis would result in an overall significant difference in hospital stays between the groups.</P>
<P>
<I>Client attrition</I>
</P>
<P>All five studies in Comparison 1 (consumer-provider versus professional staff) experienced dropouts or described reasons why participants were unable to be assessed at follow up. We were unable to determine whether losses were balanced across treatment groups in <LINK REF="STD-Clarke-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Clarke 2000</LINK> (20/178 across all three arms; 11% attrition overall) or <LINK REF="STD-Rivera-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Rivera 2007</LINK> (52/255 across all three arms; 20% attrition overall). Most of the lost participants in <LINK REF="STD-Clarke-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Clarke 2000</LINK> failed to commence treatment with the assigned provider, and it is unclear whether this related to group assignment. Most of the losses in <LINK REF="STD-Rivera-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Rivera 2007</LINK> were due to participants being discharged to long-term residential care that precluded enrolment in the clinic-based arm of the trial, although the trialists state there were no differences in the characteristics of participants who were excluded and those who remained in the study. The other three studies ranged in overall attrition from 5% (<LINK REF="STD-Solomon-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Solomon 1995</LINK>) to 46% (<LINK REF="STD-Sells-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Sells 2006</LINK>) and losses were balanced across groups (RR 0.80 (95%CI 0.58 to 1.09), P = 0.16) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.09" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.9</LINK>).</P>

In <LINK REF="CMP-001.10" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.10</LINK> we present a comparison of caseload, number of personnel, or number of clients assigned to each treatment group. <LINK REF="STD-Clarke-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Clarke 2000</LINK> had lower numbers of clients in the consumer-provider groups compared to the professionals. The workload of individual personnel also differed between treatment groups in <LINK REF="STD-Rivera-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Rivera 2007</LINK>, in which four consumer-providers were employed at half-time compared to two professionals that were employed full-time. It is unlikely these small differences would significantly bias performance in favour of consumer-providers, however this is not the case for <LINK REF="STD-Sells-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Sells 2006</LINK> in which consumer-providers had approximately half the caseload compared to professional staff. Significant differences in caseload or the time spent with clients may have biased outcomes in favour of the service delivered by consumer-providers in this study.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Time allocated to tasks</HEADING>
<P>Two studies compared the time that consumer-providers and professionals spent on different tasks within a case manager's role (<LINK REF="STD-Clarke-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Clarke 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Solomon-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Solomon 1995</LINK>). We were unable to calculate summary estimates for <LINK REF="STD-Clarke-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Clarke 2000</LINK> which reported the percentage of overall time spent with the team, clients, alone, or with family members, staff and other agencies or operators. <LINK REF="STD-Clarke-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Clarke 2000</LINK> reported no differences between consumer-providers and professionals in how much time was spent across each of the different categories (<LINK REF="CMP-001.11" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.11</LINK>). In <LINK REF="STD-Solomon-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Solomon 1995</LINK> each case manager in the two treatment groups recorded time spent on different activities. Overall, consumer-providers spent at least 18 hours more time face-to-face with clients (MD 28.25 hours (95%CI 18.06 to 38.45)) and at least 13 hours less time on the telephone with clients (MD -15.90 hours (95% CI -18.55 to -13.25) compared to professional staff. Consumer-providers also spent at least 8 hours less time in contact with client family and friends (MD -13.16 hours (95% CI -18.54 to -7.78)) and at least 16 hours less time with provider agencies and staff (MD -23.58 hours (95% CI -30.84 to -16.32)).

The study used a Making Decisions Empowerment (MDE) questionnaire and reported no significant difference in clients' subjective feelings of empowerment after 12 months between groups (time x group interaction F(1.4059) = 2.30, P = 0.13). It also found no significant difference between groups on the Personal Empowerment (PE) questionnaire in how much choice clients felt they had in their lives (time x group interaction F(1.4062) = 3.53, P = 0.06). Nor was there a significant difference between groups in how they rated the amount of certainty in their social, residential, and financial lives (time x group interaction F(1.4025) = 0.05, P = 0.82).

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Comparison 1</HEADING>
<P>There is a small amount of low to moderate quality evidence based on three studies (total N = 363) that consumer-providers have no significant effect on quality of life, function, or social relations after 12 months of case management services, compared to professional staff providing the same service (<LINK REF="STD-Rivera-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Rivera 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sells-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Sells 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Solomon-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Solomon 1995</LINK>). Similarly, three studies of low to moderate quality (total N = 293) showed no significant differences in general mental health symptoms (<LINK REF="STD-Bright-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Bright 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rivera-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Rivera 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Solomon-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Solomon 1995</LINK>). One small study at high risk of bias (N = 67) involving a 10-week program of either mutual support group therapy or cognitive behavioural therapy showed no difference in depression symptoms between groups led by a consumer-provider or professional (<LINK REF="STD-Bright-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Bright 1999</LINK>), consistent with the only other study to measure this outcome (<LINK REF="STD-Solomon-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Solomon 1995</LINK>). The studies did not report any adverse outcomes for clients.</P>
<P>Two studies of low to moderate quality (total N = 213) demonstrated no difference in satisfaction with treatment between groups involving a consumer-provider or professional staff (<LINK REF="STD-Rivera-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Rivera 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Solomon-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Solomon 1995</LINK>). Two studies (N = 160) showed no difference in assessment of the client-manager relationship between groups using case management services (<LINK REF="STD-Sells-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Sells 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Solomon-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Solomon 1995</LINK>).</P>
<P>Two low to moderate quality studies (<LINK REF="STD-Clarke-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Clarke 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rivera-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Rivera 2007</LINK>; total N = 150) demonstrated a small but significant decrease in crisis and emergency service use favouring consumer-providers, although a third study without usable data reported no difference in this outcome. There was no difference between groups in terms of hospital admissions (<LINK REF="STD-Clarke-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Clarke 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Solomon-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Solomon 1995</LINK>; N = 210) or length of stay (<LINK REF="STD-Rivera-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Rivera 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Solomon-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Solomon 1995</LINK>; N = 232).</P>
<P>There did not appear to be a significant difference in uptake of mental health services (<LINK REF="STD-Rivera-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Rivera 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Solomon-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Solomon 1995</LINK>; total N = 213) or attrition (3 studies, <LINK REF="STD-Bright-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Bright 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sells-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Sells 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Solomon-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Solomon 1995</LINK>; total N = 293).

</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Comparison 2</HEADING>
<P>There is limited evidence from two low to moderate quality studies (N = 164) that the addition of consumer-providers to existing mental health services has no significant impact on psychosocial outcomes including quality of life, function and social relations after 12 months (<LINK REF="STD-Craig-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Craig 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Donnell-1999" TYPE="STUDY">O'Donnell 1999</LINK>). The studies did not report any adverse outcomes for clients. Limited evidence (the same 2 studies involving up to 125 participants) suggests the addition of consumer-providers has no significant impact on client satisfaction with services or staff, although in one study it did improve clients' satisfaction with having their needs met, but this result did not reach clinical importance. Limited evidence from two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Craig-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Craig 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sledge-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Sledge 2011</LINK>; N = 119), indicates that the addition of consumer-providers had no effect on clients' use of mental health services (including hospital use). Evidence from one small, moderate quality trial (<LINK REF="STD-Craig-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Craig 2004</LINK>, N = 45) suggests care providers may perceive the addition of consumer-providers as leading to improvements in meeting clients' needs, although this is likely to have been affected by detection bias.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Comparison 1</HEADING>
<P>The main comparison for this review involved studies with a consumer-provider in a role that was occupied by professional staff in the comparison group. Five studies were identified involving a total of 581 trial participants, however we were only able to collect outcome data for up to three studies (up to 331 participants) for each of the outcomes assessed in this review. Although we attempted to obtain missing data from trialists, we were unable to determine effect estimates for a number of outcomes in individual studies (particularly in <LINK REF="STD-Solomon-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Solomon 1995</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Sells-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Sells 2006</LINK>). In most cases, it is likely that outcomes were selectively reported based on the lack of statistically significant findings, as outcomes with missing data were often described as having no significant difference between groups. <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK> provides a summary of missing data and reporting bias for the outcomes addressed in this review. As there was no strong evidence of effect across any of the outcomes we assessed, and outcomes with missing data were reported as 'non significant', the potential inclusion of missing data in meta-analyses is unlikely to change the results of this review.</P>
<P>Current evidence indicates there is no clinically important benefit or harm when consumer-providers are involved in the delivery of statutory mental health services. This evidence largely applies to consumer-providers as case managers within community-based mental health teams in the USA (<LINK REF="STD-Clarke-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Clarke 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rivera-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Rivera 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sells-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Sells 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Solomon-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Solomon 1995</LINK>). Interestingly, consumer-providers and professionals in some studies interacted on the same treatment teams, attended the same meetings and were able to share practice activities, which may explain the lack of differences between groups if the consumer-providers and professionals consequently adopted similar behaviours to each other.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Comparison 2</HEADING>
<P>For the second comparison group (six studies, up to 2215 participants), the three USA studies involved consumer-operated service providers as an adjunct to mental health services (<LINK REF="STD-Gordon-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Gordon 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kaufmann-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Kaufmann 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rogers-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Rogers 2007</LINK>), and studies in the USA, UK and Australia involved consumer-providers in advocacy roles (<LINK REF="STD-Craig-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Craig 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Donnell-1999" TYPE="STUDY">O'Donnell 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sledge-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Sledge 2011</LINK>). Selective outcome reporting and missing data were also limitations for this comparison group. Summary estimates for most outcomes rely on data from one small study (N = 45) conducted by <LINK REF="STD-Craig-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Craig 2004</LINK>. Several outcomes from <LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Donnell-1999" TYPE="STUDY">O'Donnell 1999</LINK> (N = 84) had insufficient data for inclusion in a pooled analysis with <LINK REF="STD-Craig-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Craig 2004</LINK> but results are unlikely to show any significant difference in outcomes between groups (<LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Donnell-1999" TYPE="STUDY">O'Donnell 1999</LINK> reported no significant difference for outcomes where data were missing).</P>
<P>Both <LINK REF="STD-Kaufmann-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Kaufmann 1995</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Rogers-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Rogers 2007</LINK> involved referral to consumer-operated services in addition to usual care, and both studies indicated uptake of these services across comparison groups as a confounder of the outcomes evaluated. These studies suggest spontaneous uptake of consumer-operated services may be between 15% to 17% when clients are not actively encouraged to attend (ie in usual care), with a potential participation rate of 57% when clients are encouraged to attend the services. These findings have implications for future studies (ie designing an intervention that takes into account potential non-adherence) and indicates there may be limited uptake of these interventions outside a research context, where uptake of services would be expected to be less.</P>
<P>Interestingly, <LINK REF="STD-Rogers-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Rogers 2007</LINK> was the largest study (N = 1827) included in this review (Comparison 2) and the outcomes reported in this study (empowerment) were not assessed in any other studies. The applicability of these findings and the contribution of this large study to the overall body of evidence is therefore very limited.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Consideration of resources and costs</HEADING>
<P>Given there is no strong evidence of significant clinical benefits or harms when employing consumer providers, there may be other factors such as resources and cost that should be considered for this type of intervention. Consumer-providers may be considered a lower cost alternative to degree-qualified health professionals (<LINK REF="REF-Salzer-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Salzer 2010</LINK>), but others may argue the cost implications are the same if life experience is considered acceptable preparation for case management (<LINK REF="STD-Solomon-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Solomon 1995</LINK>).</P>
<P>Importantly, our review identifies potential differences in working capacity (<LINK REF="STD-Sells-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Sells 2006</LINK>) and professional expertise, and potential increases in staff turnover (<LINK REF="STD-Craig-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Craig 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Donnell-1999" TYPE="STUDY">O'Donnell 1999</LINK>) for consumer-providers that must be taken into account in any cost-benefit analysis. Some studies noted absenteeism, and challenges in retaining consumer-providers. Several consumer-providers resigned due to the work being too stressful, training too lengthy, travel distance, and the negative effect of employment on welfare benefits (<LINK REF="STD-Clarke-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Clarke 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Craig-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Craig 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Donnell-1999" TYPE="STUDY">O'Donnell 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sells-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Sells 2006</LINK>). Almost all of the studies showed that consumer-providers had reduced caseloads or working hours compared to professional staff in the same role (<LINK REF="CMP-001.10" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.10</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bright-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Bright 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Clarke-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Clarke 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rivera-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Rivera 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sells-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Sells 2006</LINK>). There may also be differences in expected deliverables between consumer-providers and professional staff, as indicated in qualitative data collected by <LINK REF="STD-Sells-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Sells 2006</LINK>: "Peers were not required to fulfil traditional case manager responsibilities, giving them time and attention to devote to their clients"<I>. </I>It is unclear what the potential impact would be for clients if traditional case manager responsibilities were reduced for professional staff as well and they too had added time to devote attention to their clients.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Qualitative data reported in trials</HEADING>
<P>Six included studies (<LINK REF="STD-Clarke-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Clarke 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Craig-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Craig 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gordon-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Gordon 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Donnell-1999" TYPE="STUDY">O'Donnell 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sells-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Sells 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Solomon-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Solomon 1995</LINK>) also examined qualitative experiences of consumer-providers as providers of statutory mental health services and the impacts on both the consumer-providers themselves as well as the health professional providers, participants and/or carers.</P>
<P>The main recurring themes were:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Consumer-providers were expected to develop their role over time. They tended to feel this severely hampered their service delivery and created a perception that employing a consumer-provider was a token gesture.</LI>
<LI>Consumer-provider absenteeism due to illness or relapse of their mental health condition increased caseload for remaining staff.</LI>
<LI>Some consumer-providers experienced the role as highly rewarding and important to their lives (<LINK REF="STD-Gordon-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Gordon 1979</LINK>).</LI>
<LI>Traditional staff felt there were added expectations to support, train and supervise consumer-providers within mental health teams, increasing their workload or adding burden.</LI>
<LI>Some professional staff found it challenging to manage having different &#8216;providers' in the team.</LI>
<LI>Clients felt there were limited outcome measures relevant to assessing the impact of consumer-providers in mental health services.</LI>
</UL>
<P>Clients' beliefs about the capability of past or current service users to improve the client's condition may impact on these interventions' effects. Awareness of the care-provider's history may be an important factor for clients' behaviour modification, and subsequent receptiveness and adherence to treatment. This is reflected in qualitative data exploring how the involvement of consumer-providers is perceived by professional staff and consumer-providers themselves, and their clients and carers. These data suggest that:</P>
<UL>
<LI>a clearer description of the consumer-provider tasks, responsibilities and expected deliverables is required;</LI>
<LI>employing more consumer-providers and providing a support network for them may address relapse and absenteeism;</LI>
<LI>addressing preconceptions and impacts on traditional staff by better outlining consumer-provider roles, and the required training and support would be beneficial; and</LI>
<LI>the effects on consumer-providers themselves, including impact on skill levels, employment outcomes, social functioning, quality of life and the need to return to treatment, require further consideration.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">The consumer-provider role</HEADING>
<P>It is important to consider the role given to consumer-providers within statutory mental health services in the included studies, and the degree of training and support required. At least two of the studies indicated the role of consumer-providers was unclear, and developed throughout the duration of the trial (<LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Donnell-1999" TYPE="STUDY">O'Donnell 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sells-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Sells 2006</LINK>). Training and ongoing supervision of consumer-providers were described in most studies and, whilst lengthy training was considered one of the barriers to retaining staff, some consumer-providers felt they had received insufficient training for their role (<LINK REF="STD-Craig-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Craig 2004</LINK>). Future studies would benefit from having a clear description of the consumer-provider role (eg specific tasks, responsibilities and expected deliverables of the role) and relevant training for the role so that it can be readily implemented. The ongoing supervision provided by professional staff should also be considered as an additional resource that is needed to support consumer-providers in their role.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Outcomes</HEADING>
<P>During the lengthy gestation of this review, the research and practice context relating to user involvement in mental health service provision has changed. A new focus on individual recovery pathways (rather than cure, per se) should be reflected in the explicit consideration of different client outcomes, as well as community outcomes, in future updates of the review. These may include hope and optimism, life satisfaction, wellness, confidence, connectedness, community empowerment and social support (<LINK REF="STD-Greenfield-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Greenfield 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Simon-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Simon 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sledge-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Sledge 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-van-Gestel-2012" TYPE="STUDY">van Gestel 2012</LINK>).</P>

<P>The overall evidence of the effects of employing past or current users of mental health services is of moderate to low quality (<LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK>), and is largely based on findings from three relatively small studies (total N = 363). It is unclear whether studies took appropriate measures to allocate clients of mental health services to groups with either a consumer-provider or professional staff member independent of any potential bias the trialists, care providers, or clients had about their expected outcomes for each group. A lack of standard outcome measures across trials means it is difficult to pool outcomes across separate studies. Selective or incomplete reporting of study outcomes is a key limitation of the included studies with some studies failing to report on all of the outcomes that were assessed, others not providing comparison data across treatment groups, and one study using outcome measures specifically designed for their own study that are not assessed in any other studies. While most studies declared their funding sources, none discussed the role or level of input the funder had.</P>

<P>A previous review (<LINK REF="REF-Simpson-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Simpson 2002</LINK>) identified eight studies involving users as employees of mental health services. Five of these studies were non-randomised trials or observational studies and were ineligible for inclusion in this review. The remaining three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Solomon-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Solomon 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Clarke-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Clarke 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Donnell-1999" TYPE="STUDY">O'Donnell 1999</LINK>) are included in both reviews. Simpson and colleagues identified key differences in service delivery between consumer-providers and non consumer-providers that are consistent with the findings of this review. Overall, consumer-providers spent longer in supervision, in face-to-face contact with clients, or doing outreach work, and they spent less time on the telephone or in the office. <LINK REF="REF-Simpson-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Simpson 2002</LINK> also reported the higher turnover rate of consumer-providers and the observation that consumer-providers had less distinct professional boundaries. They concluded that consumer-providers did not have any detrimental effect on clients in terms of symptoms, functioning, or quality of life which is also reflected in our review's findings. However, our review also found no significant difference in client satisfaction with their personal circumstances or hospitalisation, whilst <LINK REF="REF-Simpson-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Simpson 2002</LINK> reported improvement in these outcomes for clients of consumer-providers.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Wright_x002d_Berryman-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wright-Berryman 2011</LINK> reviewed the literature on consumer-provided services on assertive community treatment and intensive case management teams, and concluded that there was some evidence to support consumer-provided services for improving engagement and reducing hospitalisation. Evidence of the intervention's impact on reducing symptoms and improving quality of life was, however, lacking. The authors' findings of limited evidence on the impact of consumer-provided services accords with our review. Likewise, <LINK REF="REF-Cook-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cook 2011</LINK> briefly reviewed the evidence for peer-provided, recovery-oriented mental health services and found results similar to those of our review, namely that randomised trials show comparable outcomes for peer and non-peer provided services.</P>

The review of lay health workers for improving maternal and child health and the management of infectious diseases (<LINK REF="REF-Lewin-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lewin 2010</LINK>) identified improvements in maternal and child health (specifically breastfeeding, immunisation, and childhood morbidity and mortality), and limited improvements in tuberculosis management, through the use of lay health workers. Lewin's review included substantially more studies (N = 82), in a wider range of settings than this review. Its promising findings are not inconsistent with those of our review, indicating that non-professional staff can effect positive health outcomes for clients.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2013-02-14 07:59:14 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Megan Prictor">
<P>There is low to moderate quality evidence from 11 randomised controlled trials indicating that involving consumer-providers in mental health teams results in psychosocial, mental health symptom and service use outcomes for clients that are no better or worse than those achieved by professionals employed in similar roles, particularly for case management services. There is no difference in client satisfaction with services. There is no evidence of harm associated with involving consumer-providers in mental health teams. </P>
<P>Future decisions regarding consumer-provider involvement should consider how their involvement differs compared to trained professionals and the potential impact this will have. Job descriptions, wages and benefits, training and supervision, and strategies to successfully integrate consumer-providers into multi-disciplinary teams are important issues to consider when implementing this type of intervention.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2013-02-13 16:43:48 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Future randomised controlled trials of consumer-providers in mental health service provision should minimise bias through the use of adequate randomisation and concealment of allocation, blinding of outcomes where possible, the comprehensive reporting of outcome data, and the avoidance of contamination between treatment groups. Researchers should adhere to the SPIRIT (<LINK REF="REF-SPIRIT-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">SPIRIT 2013</LINK>) and CONSORT (<LINK REF="REF-CONSORT-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">CONSORT 2010</LINK>) reporting standards for clinical trials, and use consistent, validated measurement tools.</P>
<P>Current evidence from controlled trials indicates there is no harm to clients associated with involving consumer-providers in mental health teams. Future studies should ensure that standardised mental health measures and adverse client outcomes are assessed. Potential benefits and harms to consumer-providers themselves have been less rigorously evaluated. Outcomes such as increased skills and improvements in employment outcomes, social functioning and quality of life for consumer-providers have been described in qualitative studies, but rigorous evaluation using appropriate measures for consumer-providers (eg income, living situation, need to return to treatment) in controlled studies is lacking. Economic analyses will help to inform whether potential benefits and harms for consumer-providers, and the resources required to support their role, is a cost effective investment for mental health services and clients.</P>
<P>Future studies should include a clear description of the consumer-provider role (eg specific tasks, responsibilities and expected deliverables of the role) and relevant training for the role so that it can be readily implemented.</P>
<P>The weight of evidence being strongly based in the United States, future research should be located in diverse settings including in low- and middle-income countries.</P>

<P>The protocol (<LINK REF="REF-Simpson-2003c" TYPE="REFERENCE">Simpson 2003c</LINK>) and review were prepared by different author teams. The initial protocol had planned to include randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials. The final review has been limited to randomised controlled trials.</P>
<P>Systematic data collection and presentation of adverse outcomes was not pre-specified by the original authors in the protocol, however the current review authors have included adverse events as a primary outcome of this review.</P>
<P>When the original selection criteria were applied to potentially relevant studies, we identified a group of studies that compared two different types of mental health service interventions where one of the interventions involved a consumer-provider and the alternate intervention did not. These trials are unable to provide information about the effect of a consumer-provider as there are other variables that might explain differences in outcomes between the two different interventions. We have therefore excluded these studies from the review (please refer to studies listed as "comparison group differed on more factors than consumer-provider alone" in the <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_EXCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of excluded studies</LINK>).</P>

<U>Setting</U>: Fee for service outpatient clinic, University of Memphis Department of Psychology, Memphis (TN), USA.</P>
<P>
<U>Funding</U>: Not reported.</P>
<P>
<U>Recruitment (Clients)</U>: media advertisements, those eligible were added to clinic caseload as regular fee for service outpatients, with partial fee reimbursement for those who attended weekly sessions.

<P>
<U>Recruitment (consumer-providers)</U>: Recruited from self-help groups in which they had participated or led.</P>
<P>
<U>Training/support</U>: Both consumer-providers and professionals received 2-day training, using protocol and treatment manuals for cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) and mutual support group therapy (MSG). Modules were: common interventions, cognitive behavioural techniques, and mutual support group methods. Therapists were paired with an opposite gender co-therapist with similar availability. Professionals were paired together as were consumer-providers. Further training/supervision was provided if therapists failed to adhere to the protocol (see 'fidelity' in Interventions section below).</P>
<P>
<U>Inclusion criteria (Clients)</U>: Age between 18-60 years, not currently in therapy, not currently on medication for mood disorders, no current drug or alcohol problems, minimum eighth-grade education, ability to read and complete pretreatment assessment questionnaire, score ten or higher on Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression, Structured Clinical Interview DSM-III-R Non-Patient Edition (SCID-NP) criteria for current episode of definite major depressive disorder, dysthymia, or depression not otherwise specified.</P>

<P>
<U>Study aim</U>: To assess the relative efficacy of professional and consumer-provider therapists in providing group CBT and MSG.</P>
<P>
<U>Intervention aim</U>: To reduce clients' symptoms of depression and improve mood. Trialists hypothesised that clients in the professionally-led CBT group would demonstrate better skill acquisition in monitoring and modifying dysfunctional thoughts compared with clients in the consumer-led CBT group; and that clients in the consumer-provider MSG group would show greater self-disclosure than those in the professionally-led MSG group.</P>
<P>
<U>Role of consumer-providers</U>: Involvement as therapists delivering CBT or MSG interventions.</P>
<P>
<U>Intervention (MSG)</U>: (n = 22) MSG therapy led by two paraprofessional consumer-providers (male and female) . Sessions involved informal exchanges of information between individuals faced with the same difficulties.</P>
<P>
<U>Intervention (CBT)</U>: (n = 21) CBT led by two paraprofessional consumer-providers (male and female). Sessions were based on <I>Feeling Good Seminar Series 1</I> with accompanying participant workbook, <I>The Feeling Good Handbook</I>.</P>
<P>
<U>Control (CBT)</U>: (n = 27) CBT provided by two professional therapists (male and female).</P>
<P>
<U>Control (MSG)</U>: (n = 29) MSG led by two professional therapists (male and female).</P>
<P>
<U>Delivery</U>: Ten weekly 90-minute sessions. Each pair of co-therapists (consumer-providers and professionals) conducted an MSG and CBT group concurrently.</P>
<P>
<U>Fidelity</U>: Therapist sessions were supervised once weekly, and all therapy sessions were audio-taped and observed by trained raters. If the therapist failed to accomplish any of the four general objectives for the intended condition or if they included any of the four general objectives from the other treatment conditions, further training/supervision was provided.</P>

<P>Four-arm trial involved two relevant comparisons; 1) consumer-provider led CBT vs professional led CBT and 2) consumer-provider led MSG vs professional led MSG. Each comparison has been analysed separately. Direction of benefit was reversed for analysis of HSCL-58 and HRSD outcome data.</P>
<P>
<U>Power Calculation</U>: Trialists estimated that N = 96 on the basis of an assumed attrition rate of 20%, a significance level of 0.05, power of 0.80 and an estimated moderate effect size of 0.30.</P>
<P>Thirty clients terminated therapy before completing 7 sessions and the analysed outcome data for BDI, HSRD, HSCL-58, and ATQ included only the 68 participants who attended at least 7 sessions and returned for the "posttest assessment". In some cases it may have been possible to collect and include posttest data from clients who attended less than 7 sessions and this may have been inappropriately excluded from the primary analysis. It is unclear what effect omission of data pertaining to these individuals would have on the outcomes.</P>

<P>
<U>Intervention aim</U>: To reduce symptoms in people with severe and long-standing mental illness.</P>
<P>
<U>Intervention</U>: (n = 54) Participants referred to 1 of 3 self-help groups run by current and former psychiatric patients with a psychosocial rehabilitation clubhouse approach, in addition to usual care at the CMHC. A consumer outreach worker from the self-help groups also contacted experimental subjects, and offered to accompany them to their first group meeting. Group meetings occurred once a week at three community mental health sponsored and operated drop-in centres. The centres were not solely run by consumers, however they had at least one self-help group member in a paid staff position. Attendance at the drop in centre was voluntary.</P>
<P>
<U>Control</U>: (n = 36) Participants not told about the self-help groups; encouraged to continue with their usual care at the community mental health centre.</P>
<P>
<U>Duration</U>: Unclear, records at the self-help group were kept for 6 months.</P>
<P>
<U>Fidelity</U>: Attendance at the drop in centre was voluntary. There was cross-over between groups (17% of both the treatment and control groups participated in self-help groups).</P>
<P>
<U>Consumer involvement outside of the intervention</U>: Data collection. The research team provided a cash honorarium to those members who collected data for the research project.</P>
<P>
<U>Changes in trial protocol</U>: Yes, post hoc design aimed at uncovering reasons for low participation in self-help activities in the study sample. Due to the overall low rates of participation, and the number of subjects who were cross-overs, the researchers decided to stop collecting follow-up outcome data and searched for factors in the sample's composition and the self-help group membership which might account for low participation.</P>

<P>
<U>Setting</U>: Outpatient mental health services, Eastern Sydney Area Health Service (Australia).</P>
<P>
<U>Funding</U>: Commonwealth Innovative Grants Program of the National Mental Health Strategy.</P>
<P>
<U>Recruitment clients</U>: Inpatients or community health centre clients referred for case management were invited to participate. 530 clients met the inclusion criteria, 359 were excluded from participation, and 52 refused to take part (no reasons provided).</P>
<P>
<U>Recruitment consumer--providers</U>: Recruited over a 14 month period through Eastern Area Mental Health. No other details reported.</P>
<P>
<U>Training/support</U>: Consumer Consultants trained the consumer-providers and other advocates over a 3-day period on subjects including the <I>Mental Health Act</I>, patient rights, communication and listening skills, assertiveness, conflict resolution, and stress management. Mental Health staff provided training on the diagnosis and treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, psychosocial and family interventions, case management, rehabilitation, supportive accommodation services and other community resources. Advocates met individually with a Project Director monthly, and advocates met as a group once a month. After some time this was considered inadequate support, so phone debriefing was established with an experienced advocate.</P>
<P>
<U>Inclusion criteria</U>: People aged 18-65 years, English-speaking, met DSM-IV criteria for schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, schizophreniform disorder or bipolar affective disorder, referred for case management by community health services within old Eastern Sydney Area Health Service.</P>
<P>
<U>Exclusions</U>: Co-diagnosis of substance dependence disorder, current Community Treatment Order or Community Counselling Order, history of violence (unless associated with acute psychosis).</P>

<CHAR_PARTICIPANTS MODIFIED="2013-03-01 13:59:52 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Megan Prictor">
<P>
<U>Clients</U>: 119 participants (57.1% male). Mean age 36 years (SD 9.8). Mean education 11.6 years. Predominately lived alone (39%), or with family (30%), and were supported by pension (72%), mean duration 80 months.</P>
<P>
<U>Principal mental health diagnosis/problem</U>: Schizophrenia (66%); schizoaffective disorder (16%); schizophreniform disorder (6%); and bipolar (12%).</P>
<P>
<U>Stage of illness</U>: Mean duration of illness was 117 months (SD 98.9, range 1-432), mean number of hospital admissions 6 (SD 6.4, range 1-30), and mean number of admissions per year 1 (SD 0.93, range 0-6).</P>
<P>
<U>Description consumer-providers</U>: Six advocates and three reserve advocates were included that were either: 1) recovered individuals who had experienced mental illness themselves (consumer-providers); 2) siblings or carers of people who had experienced mental illness (secondary consumers); or 3) non-consumers who were interested in working with people with mental illness. During the project the focus changed to studying the effects of only primary consumers so advocates were replaced as positions opened with consumer-providers only.</P>

<CHAR_INTERVENTIONS MODIFIED="2013-03-01 14:02:52 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Megan Prictor">
<P>
<U>Study aim</U>: To redress the perceived hierarchical delivery of mental health services, in which the "service" has the authority and the client has little or none, with the services being imposed. The project aimed to empower the client by establishing parity between client and staff without legal imposition and involve clients in their rehabilitative process in a consensual manner that promoted respect, dignity and self-determination.</P>
<P>
<U>Intervention aim</U>: To test if the delivery of client focused case management services compared with standard community practice would improve functioning, disability, quality of life, and service satisfaction for clients, as well as family burden of care outcomes. To test if consumer advocacy services in addition to client focused case management service delivery would improve outcomes, and whether clients who were more empowered by the use of client-focused approaches would be more satisfied and compliant with services received.</P>
<P>
<U>Role of consumer-provider</U>: Employed as consumer advocates in case management teams, initially recruited to each work 3 hrs/week (based on Rozelle Hospital advocate program). Advocates were assigned 3-6 clients each for 12-month period.</P>
<P>
<U>Intervention</U>: Client-focused case management (n = 45) plus consumer advocates (some consumer-providers). Consumer advocates provided self-advocacy for clients, encouraged client's self confidence, and were role models for clients during their recovery. They also communicated with case managers and participated in the development of recovery agreement meetings where requested by clients.</P>
<P>
<U>Control 1</U>: Client-focused case management (n = 39). Case managers trained in the use of Rose's Advocacy Empowerment Model in clinical practice and familiar with solution-focused and narrative approaches to therapy. Involved customised recovery plans, with emphasis on client recovery goals. Recovery agreement meetings held between client, case manager, treating psychiatrist, family member or significant other, and sometimes consumer advocate to reinforce support for client achieving recovery goals.</P>
<P>
<U>Control 2</U>: Standard case management (n = 35). Usual case management practices provided by existing community case managers.</P>
<P>
<U>Duration</U>: 12 months.</P>
<P>
<U>Fidelity</U>: Consumer advocacy and client participation was seemingly compromised as it was not possible to widely advertise or promote consumer advocacy or its potential benefits because the study was only open to clients in particular diagnostic categories. This meant consumer advocates had to explain their role and promote themselves to clients, and this reportedly had a disempowering effect on the advocates. Client-related illness (eg paranoid symptoms) also led to clients rejecting advocates before they could develop rapport.</P>
<P>
<U>Consumer involvement outside of the intervention</U>: None.</P>
<P>
<U>Changes in trial protocol</U>: Changed eligibility criteria from 55 to 65 years to increase potential participants. Siblings, carers or interested non-consumers, in addition to consumer-providers, were originally recruited as advocates but a post hoc decision meant that only consumer-providers were recruited to replace advocates that left during the project.</P>

<U>Intervention aim</U>: Consumer-provider were to deliver support for participants (peer companion model), with the aim to reduce inpatient hospitalizations.</P>
<P>
<U>Role of consumer-providers</U>: Consumer-providers gave support for clients. Consumer-providers delivered non-clinical activities determined by the clients' interests. Consumer-provider caseload not described.</P>
<P>
<U>Intervention</U>: Mentors were instructed not to aim for any specific goal other than to support their clients (n = 38). Recovery mentors were trained to use their own first-hand experiences as a basis on which to provide support to participants. Frequency of contact determined by mentee in collaboration with mentor. 13 of 38 intervention-group patients had no contact with their mentee. Data for 55% of intervention-group patients showed that mean frequency of contact was 13.43 contacts (SD 11.46), over nine months. Mean total hours of contact: 24.15 hours (SD 17.41).</P>
<P>
<U>Control</U>: (n = 36) Direct clinical care received by both groups consisted of what was available to them through their own efforts and resources. Most of the clinical care was delivered in the public sector via community-based organizations that are funded by the DMHAS either through a state facility or grants to private, nonprofit community-based, mental healthcare centres. Generally clinical care consisted of medication, psycho-education and case management, and supportive psychotherapy.</P>

<P>
<U>Study aim</U>: To determine if satisfaction with general mental health treatment would be greater for clients of the consumer-provider case management teams compared with clients of non-consumer case managers, and if individual characteristics of case managers may significantly affect satisfaction with treatment for clients of mental health services.</P>
<P>
<U>Intervention aim</U>: Designed to compare the outcomes of clients served by two teams of case managers. To determine whether a team of mental health service consumer-providers delivered intensive case management services differently than a team of professional case managers.</P>
<P>
<U>Role of consumer-provider</U>: Case management operated as a part of a consumer-run advocacy and service organisation which had a consumer director, 4 case managers (3 consumer-provider case managers and 1 non-consumer case manager). The non-consumer later left and was replaced with a consumer-provider. In the 2nd year, a full-time clinical director and part time psychiatrist were hired.</P>
<P>
<U>Intervention</U>: (n = 48) Consumer-provider case management team. Team comprised 4 case managers that met 3 times a week. Each team member had their own clients. Case managers saw clients in their own environments and provided individualised social support for community living. Case management was based on the ACT model. Case managers routinely interacted with health professionals, community and social welfare staff, benefits administrators, families and housing providers to plan or monitor services.</P>
<P>
<U>Control</U>: (n = 48) Non-consumer case management team. Team comprised 4 case managers that met biweekly and also met with another team of intensive case managers monthly. Also based on the ACT model.</P>

<APPENDIX_BODY MODIFIED="2013-03-01 11:46:41 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Megan Prictor">
<P>The term 'consumer' describes any adult who is currently using mental health services. Some publications have employed the terms '(service) user', 'customer', 'client', or 'patient' to describe consumers. The term 'consumer' is intended to be seen as a neutral definition. The term 'user' is sometimes avoided because of connotations of substance abuse (<LINK REF="REF-Chamberlain-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chamberlain 1993</LINK>). In this review, 'user' does not imply drug use. For this review, the term 'consumer' excludes carers, potential service users and user representatives.</P>
<P>'Ex-user' denotes any former user of mental health services. Some ex-users prefer the term 'survivor' (<LINK REF="REF-Graley-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Graley 1994</LINK>), however this can have connotations of abuse survival, and some professionals have found this inappropriate (<LINK REF="REF-Everett-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Everett 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>In this review, we use the term 'consumer-provider' (<LINK REF="REF-Cook-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cook 1995</LINK>) to describe consumers acting as mental health service employees, for example consumers working as case managers (<LINK REF="STD-Solomon-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Solomon 1995</LINK>), or as staff in a crisis assessment programme (<LINK REF="REF-Lyons-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lyons 1996</LINK>). This may be either paid or unpaid employment with the service. We use the term 'consumer-provider' to indicate the role played in the service, as a service provider with declared consumer (user or ex-user) status. It does not imply any differences in demographics or mental health status between consumer-providers and other consumers (users or ex-users). Alternatively, consumer-providers have been referred to as consumer-survivors, peer educators, peer specialists (<LINK REF="REF-Repper-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Repper 2011</LINK>), consumer-employees (<LINK REF="REF-Mowbray-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mowbray 1996</LINK>), user-employees, or prosumers (<LINK REF="REF-Solomon-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Solomon 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>Consumer-provided services are different from consumer-operated service providers (COSPs). COSPs are independent, rather than statutory, organisations (<LINK REF="REF-ViaHope-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">ViaHope 2013</LINK>), providing peer run and delivered services in the 'self-help' model, not in partnership with professionals (<LINK REF="STD-Segal-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Segal 2011</LINK>). They are "administratively and financially controlled by mental health consumers who plan, deliver, and evaluate their services" (<LINK REF="REF-Campbell-2008b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Campbell 2008b</LINK>). COSPs are outside the scope of this review.</P>
<P>The term 'mental health professionals' refers to staff of statutory mental health services. Although some professionals will have experience of using mental health services, they are not included as consumer-providers, as the latter are in roles designated only for declared service users.</P>
<P>The term 'client' refers to recipients of the mental health services in the studies. They may be receiving services from consumer-providers. We use the term 'client' to avoid confusion between those consumers receiving the service (clients) and those providing the service (consumer-providers). Distinguishing between roles that consumers take in a service (eg provider or recipient) by referring to them in different terms is common practice in the literature of involving consumers as service providers (<LINK REF="REF-Solomon-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Solomon 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>For this review, the terms 'user involvement' or 'consumer involvement' refer to involvement in services (not in own care), and are understood to mean active involvement in the provision of mental health services.</P>
