<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2013-01-02 13:13:37 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Pulmonary hypertension is an increase in blood pressure in the pulmonary artery, pulmonary vein, or pulmonary capillaries, together known as the lung vasculature, leading to shortness of breath, dizziness, fainting, and other symptoms, all of which are exacerbated by exertion. The World Health Organization (WHO) has reclassified pulmonary hypertension into five groups based on their mechanisms rather than associated conditions. We have focused on pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) only in this review. Pulmonary arterial hypertension is a devastating disease characterised by an increase in pulmonary vascular resistance which leads to right ventricular failure and ultimately death.</P>
<P>Tradiational therapies for pulmonary arterial hypertension include prostacyclin and its analogues, calcium channel blockers, nitric oxide (NO), and important adjunctive therapies, such as anticoagulants and oxygen. Endothelin receptor antagonists have recently been proposed as an alternative to these traditional therapies. This review includes twelve trials on 1471 participants. Endothelin receptor antagonists can improve exercise capacity, symptoms, and cardiopulmonary haemodynamic variables in people with symptomatic pulmonary arterial hypertension over a period of three to six months treatment. There is uncertainty as to whether endothelin receptor antagonists reduce mortality in this population. The most severe potential side effect was hepatic toxicity which was not common in these short-term trials.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-01-02 13:13:33 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included 12 randomised controlled trials involving 1471 patients. All the trials were of relatively short duration (12 weeks to six months). After treatment, patients treated with endothelin receptor antagonists could walk on average 33.71 metres (95% confidence interval (CI) 24.90 to 42.52 metres) further than those treated with placebo in a six-minute walk test. Endothelin receptor antagonists improved more patients' World Health Organization/New York Heart Association (WHO/NYHA) functional class status than placebo (odds ratio (OR) 1.60; 95% CI 1.20 to 2.14), and reduced the odds of functional class deterioration compared with placebo (OR 0.26; 95% CI 0.16 to 0.42). There was a reduction in mortality that did not reach statistical significance on endothelin receptor antagonists (OR 0.57; 95% CI 0.26 to 1.24), and limited data suggest that endothelin receptor antagonists improve the Borg dyspnoea score and cardiopulmonary haemodynamics in symptomatic patients. Hepatic toxicity was not common, and endothelin receptor antagonists were well tolerated in this population. However, several cases of irreversible liver failure caused by sitaxsentan have been reported that led to license holder for sitaxsentan to withdraw the product from all markets worldwide.</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2013-01-02 13:13:34 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Endothelin receptor antagonists can increase exercise capacity, improve WHO/NYHA functional class, prevent WHO/NYHA functional class deterioration, reduce dyspnoea and improve cardiopulmonary haemodynamic variables in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension with WHO/NYHA functional class II and III. However, there was only a trend towards endothelin receptor antagonists reducing mortality in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension. Efficacy data are strongest in those with idiopathic pulmonary hypertension. The irreversible liver failure caused by sitaxsentan and its withdrawal from global markets emphasise the importance of hepatic monitoring in patients treated with endothelin receptor antagonists.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2013-01-02 13:14:05 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2013-01-02 13:13:48 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">
<P>Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a rare disease of the distal pulmonary arteries that is characterised by vasoconstriction, vascular proliferation, obstructive remodelling of the pulmonary vessel wall, inflammation and thrombosis, which lead to a progressive increase in pulmonary vascular resistance and, ultimately, right ventricular failure and death (<LINK REF="REF-Archer-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Archer 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gali_x00e8_-2009a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Galiè 2009a</LINK>). Classically, pulmonary veins are unaffected. PAH includes five subcategories (<LINK REF="REF-Gali_x00e8_-2009a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Galiè 2009a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NHLBI-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">NHLBI 2011</LINK>): (1) Idiopathic PAH; (2) Heritable PAH; (3) drug- and toxin-induced PAH; (4) Associated with PAH (APAH) including connective tissue diseases, HIV infection, portal hypertension, congenital heart disease, schistosomiasis, chronic haemolytic anaemia; (5) Persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn.</P>
<P>The pathogenesis of PAH involves multiple mechanisms. However, endothelial dysfunction characterised by over-expression of vasoconstrictors and downexpression of vasoactive mediators plays a key role in PAH. Reduced production of vasoactive mediators such as nitric oxide (NO) and prostacyclin, along with over-expression of vasoconstrictors such as endothelin-1 (ET-1) and thromboxane A<SUB>2</SUB>, increase pulmonary vascular tone and promote pulmonary vascular remodelling. Therefore, the substances targeting these mechanisms represent logical therapeutic strategies (<LINK REF="REF-Archer-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Archer 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gali_x00e8_-2009a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Galiè 2009a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Liu-2006a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liu 2006a</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2013-01-02 13:13:57 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">
<P>Endothelin receptor antagonists (ERAs) are a class of potent vasodilators and antimitotic substances, which could specifically dilate and remodel the pulmonary arterial system, and which have recently been proposed as an alternative to traditional therapies. Two separate receptors for ET have been identified: endothelin type A (ET-A) receptors, which are most commonly found on vascular smooth muscle cells, and which induce vasoconstriction by increasing intracellular calcium; and endothelin type B (ET-B) receptors located on endothelial cells, which stimulate the release of vasodilating agents such as NO and prostacyclin. However, ET-B receptors also appear on vascular smooth muscle cells where they stimulate vasoconstriction. Theoretically, either selective blocking of ET-A receptors alone or non-selective blocking of both ET-A and ET-B receptors together could dilate local vessels.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2013-01-02 13:13:58 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>Research evidence suggests that endothelin is overexpressed in the lungs of patients with PAH (<LINK REF="REF-Giaid-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Giaid 1993</LINK>) and elevated plasma endothelin concentrations are correlated with poorer prognosis (<LINK REF="REF-Rubens-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rubens 2001</LINK>). Furthermore, an overproduction of endothelin may also lead to pulmonary vascular remodelling in PAH (<LINK REF="REF-Kim-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kim 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mansoor-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mansoor 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wort-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wort 2001</LINK>). Recently a number of RCTs have been published (<LINK REF="STD-ARIES_x002d_1" TYPE="STUDY">ARIES-1</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-ARIES_x002d_2" TYPE="STUDY">ARIES-2</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-BREATHE_x002d_1" TYPE="STUDY">BREATHE-1</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-BREATHE_x002d_2" TYPE="STUDY">BREATHE-2</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-STRIDE_x002d_1" TYPE="STUDY">STRIDE-1</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-STRIDE_x002d_2" TYPE="STUDY">STRIDE-2</LINK>) suggesting that ERAs could increase exercise capacity and improve patients' functional class and symptoms.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2013-01-02 13:14:05 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">
<P>Currently, treatment options for PAH include prostacyclin and its analogues, calcium channel blockers, NO, and important adjunctive therapies, including anticoagulants and oxygen (<LINK REF="REF-Liu-2006a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liu 2006a</LINK> ). Over the past decades, the prognosis of patients with PAH has greatly improved with the use of combinations of these treatments. However, all of these treatments have some limitations. Vasodilators, especially calcium channel blockers, are only effective in a small proportion of patients (<LINK REF="REF-Reeves-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reeves 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sitbon-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sitbon 1998</LINK>). Prostacyclin has been delivered via continuous intravenous infusion, which may lead to severe side effects such as catheter infection, catheter thrombosis, and paradoxical embolism (<LINK REF="REF-Badesch--2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Badesch 2000</LINK>). Furthermore, pump or catheter malfunction may result in life-threatening loss of haemodynamic effects. Recent clinical data showed that analogues of prostacyclin are effective in patients with PAH at least for the short term (12 weeks), and have few severe side effects (<LINK REF="REF-Paramothayan-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Paramothayan 2005</LINK>) but long-term effects remain to be confirmed. Inhaled NO can improve exercise capacity in patients with PAH (<LINK REF="REF-Hasuda-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hasuda 2000</LINK>) but this treatment requires a continuous inhalation device and is therefore impractical. Phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors (PDEI, for example, sildenafil) are a promising new group of drugs, and results of a randomised controlled trial (RCT) confirmed its short term (12 weeks) efficacy in PAH (<LINK REF="REF-Gali_x00e8_-2005a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Galiè 2005a</LINK>), yet its long-term efficacy remains to be confirmed. ERAs are the most promising new drug class for treatment of PAH.</P>

<DATA_SYNTHESIS MODIFIED="2013-01-02 13:14:35 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">
<P>In the absence of significant heterogeneity, we combined results using a mean difference (MD) for continuous data, and Odds Ratio (OR) for dichotomous data.

<P>A number of articles reported studies where more than one eligible treatment arm was included. For these studies we split the data between two treatment-control comparisons by splitting the control group and halving the sample sizes. For example, <LINK REF="STD-STRIDE_x002d_1" TYPE="STUDY">STRIDE-1</LINK> was a triple-arm clinical study which did not provide combined 'sitaxsentan' data versus placebo on secondary outcomes, such as mean pulmonary artery pressure (mPAP), pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) and confidence intervals (CIs). We divided the data down into two trials: <LINK REF="STD-STRIDE_x002d_1-_x0028_100mg_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">STRIDE-1 (100mg)</LINK> using sitaxsentan 100 mg daily and <LINK REF="STD-STRIDE_x002d_1-_x0028_300mg_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">STRIDE-1 (300mg)</LINK> using sitaxsentan 300 mg daily; data for placebo participants were entered with the number of participants in each of the placebo 'groups' halved. Thus, the total numbers in the meta-analysis added up to the original size of the group. The same method was used in <LINK REF="STD-STRIDE_x002d_2" TYPE="STUDY">STRIDE-2</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-STRIDE_x002d_4" TYPE="STUDY">STRIDE-4</LINK>: See the table <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>. <LINK REF="STD-STRIDE_x002d_2" TYPE="STUDY">STRIDE-2</LINK> compared sitaxsentan with both a placebo arm and an open-label bosentan arm. For this study, we used the data from patients treated with bosentan and placebo for reference in the notes, and we did not pool the data with those of other studies.</P>

<P>Twelve trials on 1471 participants are included in this review (<LINK REF="STD-ARIES_x002d_1" TYPE="STUDY">ARIES-1</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-ARIES_x002d_2" TYPE="STUDY">ARIES-2</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-BREATHE_x002d_1" TYPE="STUDY">BREATHE-1</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-BREATHE_x002d_2" TYPE="STUDY">BREATHE-2</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-BREATHE_x002d_5" TYPE="STUDY">BREATHE-5</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Channick-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Channick 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-EARLY" TYPE="STUDY">EARLY</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-STRIDE_x002d_1" TYPE="STUDY">STRIDE-1</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-STRIDE_x002d_2" TYPE="STUDY">STRIDE-2</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-STRIDE_x002d_4" TYPE="STUDY">STRIDE-4</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-SERAPH" TYPE="STUDY">SERAPH</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-ASSET_x002d_1" TYPE="STUDY">ASSET-1</LINK>).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Clinical efficacy</HEADING>
<P>Endothelin receptor antagonists (ERAs) can increase 6MWD, improve WHO/NYHA functional class, prevent WHO/NYHA functional class deterioration, lower the Borg dyspnoea score and improve cardiopulmonary haemodynamic measures in the relatively short term of three to six months therapy in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH).</P>
<P>PAH has a high mortality rate. Only anticoagulation has shown some survival benefit in patients with idiopathic PAH in observational studies (<LINK REF="REF-Fuster-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fuster 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rich-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rich 1992</LINK>). Transplantation remains the preferred therapy with a major reduction in mortality. Currently, the evidence that ERAs have an impact on the risk of death is limited by the short duration of the studies and infrequent occurrence of this event in some trials (<LINK REF="STD-Channick-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Channick 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-BREATHE_x002d_5" TYPE="STUDY">BREATHE-5</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-STRIDE_x002d_4" TYPE="STUDY">STRIDE-4</LINK>). There is insufficient certainty around the observed result to exclude either a reduction in mortality or no difference.</P>
<P>Furthermore, the six-minute walk test (6MWT), as well as being a reliable tool for the assessment of exercise capacity in patients with PAH is also an independent predictor of mortality (<LINK REF="REF-Miyamoto-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Miyamoto 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sitbon-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sitbon 2002</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-Barst-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barst 1996</LINK> showed that a treatment-related improvement of 47 metres in the 6MWT was associated with improved survival in patients with idiopathic PAH treated with prostacyclin. There was a similar improvement in exercise with ERAs. <LINK REF="REF-McLaughlin-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">McLaughlin 2005</LINK> reported long-term observational survival data from the extension studies of <LINK REF="STD-Channick-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Channick 2001</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-BREATHE_x002d_1" TYPE="STUDY">BREATHE-1</LINK> which further confirmed this observation; Kaplan-Meier survival estimates in the patients with idiopathic PAH given bosentan were 96% at 12 months and 89% at 24 months, compared to the predicted survivals of 69% and 57%, respectively. <LINK REF="REF-Chen-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chen 2008</LINK> reported that the estimated three-year survival in patients with PAH with WHO/NYHA function class III was 87% (95% CI, 81 to 91) for bosentan versus 75% (95% CI, 71 to 79) for prostacyclin.</P>
<P>The exact mechanism of action of ERAs on the pulmonary vascular bed remains unclear. Vasodilatation is likely to be just a part of the mechanism since usually 70% to 80% of patients with idiopathic PAH do not respond acutely to vasodilators (<LINK REF="REF-Rich-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rich 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sitbon-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sitbon 1998</LINK>). Endothelin is likely to be involved in pulmonary vasoconstriction, inflammation, cellular proliferation and fibrosis, i.e. vascular remodelling (<LINK REF="REF-Filep-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Filep 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gater-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gater 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Katwa-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Katwa 1993</LINK>). Recent research has illustrated that bosentan has the capacity to blunt the vascular remodelling normally associated with PAH (<LINK REF="REF-Kim-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kim 2000</LINK>). If ERAs could prevent remodelling in patients, they might substantially improve the long-term survival in those with mild symptoms (WHO class II or I), but this needs to be confirmed by long-term follow-up studies.</P>
<P>The head-to-head study conducted by <LINK REF="STD-SERAPH" TYPE="STUDY">SERAPH</LINK> did not show that there was a significant difference between bosentan and sildenafil but because of the small sample size in this study, the results should be interpreted with caution.</P>
<P>Combination therapy is an attractive option to treat the multiple pathophysiological mechanisms in PAH. Combination therapy might be pursued by the simultaneous initiation of two (or more) treatments or by the addition of a second (or third) treatment to a previous therapy that is considered insufficient. Which strategy is the best choice is currently unknown as few data are available. The <LINK REF="STD-BREATHE_x002d_2" TYPE="STUDY">BREATHE-2</LINK> trials with small sample sizes explored the efficacy and safety of combination therapy (bosentan in combination with intravenous prostacyclin), and showed a trend without statistical significance toward haemodynamic and clinical improvement of this combination in patients with PAH. Clearly there is an interaction between bosentan and prostacyclin in the <LINK REF="STD-BREATHE_x002d_2" TYPE="STUDY">BREATHE-2</LINK> trial. However, in light of predefined subgroups in the protocol, <LINK REF="STD-BREATHE_x002d_2" TYPE="STUDY">BREATHE-2</LINK> trial was included in the meta-analysis of ERAs versus placebo. Nevertheless, excluding <LINK REF="STD-BREATHE_x002d_2" TYPE="STUDY">BREATHE-2</LINK> from the meta-analysis made little difference to the results.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Subgroup analysis</HEADING>
<P>Both a non-selective ERA and selective ERA can dilate constricted pulmonary pre-capillary arterioles and improve exercise capacity and symptoms. Determining the relative benefit of these agents requires head-to-head comparisons. A post-hoc analysis of the <LINK REF="STD-STRIDE_x002d_2" TYPE="STUDY">STRIDE-2</LINK> trial that was neither designed nor powered to detect non-inferiority or equivalence showed the mean difference in the 18-week change from baseline between sitaxsentan and bosentan was 1.9 metres (95% CI -22.7 to 26.5; P = 0.9).</P>
<P>Efficacy data for ERAs in PAH secondary to other conditions (i.e. not idiopathic PAH) are still limited. The role of ERAs in this setting still needs to be confirmed in future studies.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Safety and tolerability</HEADING>
<P>One major concern about ERAs is hepatotoxicity and its capacity to cause substantial damage to the liver. This review did not show a high occurrence of hepatic toxicity when using lower dose of bosentan (125 mg or 250 mg twice daily). This safety profile is consistent with results of European post-marketing surveillance of bosentan in pulmonary hypertension (<LINK REF="REF-Humbert-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Humbert 2007</LINK>). However, there were three reported cases of irreversible liver failure induced by sitaxsentan, one from the UK (in 2009) and two cases from clinical trials in India and the Ukraine (in 2010). The reported fatal hepatic toxicity in association with sitaxsentan was idiosyncratic, was unlikely to be detected by monthly monitoring, and was irreversible when sitaxsentan was discontinued. Thus, sitaxsentan has been withdrawn from the market voluntarily by its license holder. These cases emphasise the importance of dosing and hepatic monitoring in patients with PAH.</P>
<P>Sitaxsentan inhibits the CYP2C9 P450 cytochrome enzyme, the principal hepatic enzyme involved in warfarin metabolism. In patients using warfarin or warfarin analogues, the incidence of bleeding was higher on sitaxsentan. However, it became less common with reduction in the warfarin dose at sitaxsentan initiation (<LINK REF="STD-STRIDE_x002d_2" TYPE="STUDY">STRIDE-2</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2009-05-01 09:28:57 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>The pooled data showed that ERAs can increase exercise capacity, improve WHO/NYHA functional class, prevent WHO/NYHA functional class deterioration, decrease Borg dyspnoea scores and improve cardiopulmonary haemodynamic variables in patients with PAH, with most evidence coming from studies in patients with the idiopathic form of the disease. The direction of effect on mortality favours ERAs over placebo although there is insufficient certainty around the observed result to exclude no difference.</P>

<P>Endothelin receptor antagonists (ERAs) can increase exercise capacity, improve WHO/NYHA functional class, prevent deterioration in WHO/NYHA functional class, reduce dyspnoea scores and improve cardiopulmonary haemodynamic variables in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) with WHO/NYHA functional class II and III. However, there was only a trend towards ERAs reducing mortality in patients with PAH. Efficacy data are strongest in those with the idiopathic form of the disease. The irreversible liver failure caused by sitaxsentan and its withdrawal from global markets emphasise the importance of hepatic monitoring in patients treated with ERAs.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2013-01-02 13:17:09 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>This review shows that the question of the effects of ERAs on PAH should now be regarded as partially answered. Further randomised trials to address the remaining uncertainty about the effects of ERAs on PAH associated with connective tissue disease are still needed. ERAs' effect on mortality remains uncertain and long-term observational studies are warranted.</P>
