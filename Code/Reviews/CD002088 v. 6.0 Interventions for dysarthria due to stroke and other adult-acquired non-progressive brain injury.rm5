<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2017-01-16 10:45:56 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>
<B>Review question</B>
<BR/>Does any type of treatment help people who have difficulty speaking clearly after a stroke or other types of brain injury acquired during adulthood?</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
<BR/>Brain damage caused by stroke, injury or other non-progressive disease can make speech unclear and difficult for listeners to understand. This condition is known as dysarthria and it occurs when face, tongue, and throat muscles are weak, slow, and unco-ordinated. Dysarthria can cause people who are affected to lose confidence when talking and become socially isolated, even if others see symptoms as mild. People with dysarthria do not have difficulties thinking, remembering, or retrieving words.</P>
<P>Treatment is usually provided by a speech and language therapist or speech pathologist and involves advice and education plus strategies and exercises to increase clarity of speech and to cope with social interaction. Other types of treatment used include acupuncture or brain stimulation.</P>
<P>We wanted to find out if any treatments work, if the effects are long lasting, and if so, which works best, when treatment should start, how frequent treatment should be, and for how long. To find out we searched for, evaluated, and summarised the quality of the existing research on this topic.</P>
<P>
<B>Search date</B>
</P>
<P>We searched the literature up to May 2016.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
<BR/>We included five small trials that randomised only 234 people, almost all with stroke. Two trials investigated dysarthria treatment versus an attention control and three compared one treatment with usual care. There were no trials that compared one treatment to no treatment.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
<BR/>We found few randomised controlled trials of dysarthria treatment, and those that have been conducted involved small numbers of participants, or were not adequately designed or had serious reporting flaws.</P>
<P>We compared many different measures at various time points after treatment, so caution is recommended when interpreting results. We found no evidence of effectiveness on most measures, including long-lasting improvement in every day communication abilities. A positive finding was short-term improvement in muscle movement, such as tongue and lip control. However, this result is not reliable because it was based on small numbers of people, and we found concerns about the conduct and reporting of some trials. This finding needs to be investigated in a bigger, better designed trial.</P>
<P>We found insufficient evidence to tell us whether any one treatment is better than any other or whether treatment is better than general support, or no treatment. We found no studies that examined timing, duration, or intensity of treatment. This is a clinically important question and should be considered in future trials.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
<BR/>The included trials varied in quality but all included small numbers of participants. Overall, studies were rated as low to very low quality evidence.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2016-12-20 14:26:04 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Dysarthria is an acquired speech disorder following neurological injury that reduces intelligibility of speech due to weak, imprecise, slow and/or unco-ordinated muscle control. The impact of dysarthria goes beyond communication and affects psychosocial functioning. This is an update of a review previously published in 2005. The scope has been broadened to include additional interventions, and the title amended accordingly.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2016-06-07 11:45:17 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>To assess the effects of interventions to improve dysarthric speech following stroke and other non-progressive adult-acquired brain injury such as trauma, infection, tumour and surgery.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2016-12-06 12:56:27 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (May 2016), CENTRAL (Cochrane Library 2016, Issue 4), MEDLINE, Embase, and CINAHL on 6 May 2016. We also searched Linguistics and Language Behavioral Abstracts (LLBA) (1976 to November 2016) and PsycINFO (1800 to September 2016). To identify further published, unpublished and ongoing trials, we searched major trials registers: WHO ICTRP, the ISRCTN registry, and ClinicalTrials.gov. We also handsearched the reference lists of relevant articles and contacted academic institutions and other researchers regarding other published, unpublished or ongoing trials. We did not impose any language restrictions.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2016-11-11 16:31:12 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We selected randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing dysarthria interventions with 1) no intervention, 2) another intervention for dysarthria (this intervention may differ in methodology, timing of delivery, duration, frequency or theory), or 3) an attention control.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2016-12-06 12:56:41 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>Three review authors selected trials for inclusion, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. We attempted to contact study authors for clarification and missing data as required. We calculated standardised mean difference (SMD) and 95% confidence interval (CI), using a random-effects model, and performed sensitivity analyses to assess the influence of methodological quality. We planned to conduct subgroup analyses for underlying clinical conditions.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-01-06 12:37:27 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included five small trials that randomised a total of 234 participants. Two studies were assessed as low risk of bias; none of the included studies were adequately powered. Two studies used an attention control and three studies compared to an alternative intervention, which in all cases was one intervention versus usual care intervention. The searches we carried out did not find any trials comparing an intervention with no intervention. The searches did not find any trials of an intervention that compared variations in timing, dose, or intensity of treatment using the same intervention. Four studies included only people with stroke; one included mostly people with stroke, but also those with brain injury. Three studies delivered interventions in the first few months after stroke; two recruited people with chronic dysarthria. Three studies evaluated behavioural interventions, one investigated acupuncture and another transcranial magnetic stimulation. One study included people with dysarthria within a broader trial of people with impaired communication.</P>
<P>Our primary analysis of a persisting (three to nine months post-intervention) effect at the activity level of measurement found no evidence in favour of dysarthria intervention compared with any control (SMD 0.18, 95% CI -0.18 to 0.55; 3 trials, 116 participants, GRADE: low quality, I = 0%). Findings from sensitivity analysis of studies at low risk of bias were similar, with a slightly wider confidence interval and low heterogeneity (SMD 0.21, 95% CI -0.30 to 0.73, I = 32%; 2 trials, 92 participants, GRADE: low quality). Subgroup analysis results for stroke were similar to the primary analysis because few non-stroke participants had been recruited to trials (SMD 0.16, 95% CI -0.23 to 0.54, I = 0%; 3 trials, 106 participants, GRADE: low quality).</P>
<P>Similar results emerged from most of the secondary analyses. There was no evidence of a persisting effect at the impairment (SMD 0.07, 95% CI -0.91 to 1.06, I = 70%; 2 trials, 56 participants, GRADE: very low quality) or participation level (SMD -0.11, 95% CI -0.56 to 0.33, I = 0%; 2 trials, 79 participants, GRADE: low quality) but substantial heterogeneity on the former. Analyses of immediate post-intervention outcomes provided no evidence of any short-term benefit on activity (SMD 0.29, 95% CI -0.07 to 0.66, I = 0%; 3 trials, 117 participants, GRADE: very low quality); or participation (SMD -0.24, 95% CI -0.94 to 0.45; 1 study, 32 participants) levels of measurement.</P>
<P>There was a statistically significant effect favouring intervention at the immediate, impairment level of measurement (SMD 0.47, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.92, P = 0.04, I = 0%; 4 trials, 99 participants, GRADE: very low quality) but only one of these four trials had a low risk of bias.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2017-01-23 10:18:07 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>We found no definitive, adequately powered RCTs of interventions for people with dysarthria. We found limited evidence to suggest there may be an immediate beneficial effect on impairment level measures; more, higher quality research is needed to confirm this finding.</P>
<P>Although we evaluated five studies, the benefits and risks of interventions remain unknown and the emerging evidence justifies the need for adequately powered clinical trials into this condition.</P>
<P>People with dysarthria after stroke or brain injury should continue to receive rehabilitation according to clinical guidelines.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2017-01-06 12:52:38 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2017-01-06 12:45:22 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Dysarthria is a speech disorder affecting intelligibility due to disturbances in neuromuscular control. Dysarthria affects approximately 20% to 30% of stroke survivors (<LINK REF="REF-Lawrence-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lawrence 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lubart-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lubart 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Warlow-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Warlow 2008</LINK>) and 10% to 60% of those who survive traumatic brain injury. It can occur in adults as an outcome of meningitis, encephalitis, post-surgical meningioma, and acoustic neuroma (<LINK REF="REF-Sellars-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sellars 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>Dysarthria is defined as a neurologic motor speech impairment causing the speech musculature to be slow, weak and/or imprecise (<LINK REF="REF-Duffy-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Duffy 2013</LINK>). This causes poor co-ordination of movements involving breathing, voice production, resonance, and oral articulation (<LINK REF="REF-Yorkston-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yorkston 1996</LINK>). People with dysarthric speech typically sound less intelligible or slurred because of poor oral control of articulators, particularly the tongue. Speech can also be quiet, underpowered, and lacking expressiveness because of respiratory control or impaired vocal cord function. Dysarthria includes a wide severity range; some people may be mostly unintelligible to the listener; people at the milder end of the range may experience lapses in speech accuracy, or fatigue, but speech is generally intelligible.</P>
<P>Dysarthria impacts beyond impaired communication. It can negatively affect psychological wellbeing, social participation, and rehabilitation (<LINK REF="REF-Brady-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brady 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Dickson-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dickson 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tilling-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tilling 2001</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-Brady-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brady 2011</LINK> found that the psychological impact can be influenced by pre-morbid levels of communication demands. An individual with mild dysarthria, but high levels of communication before their illness, may experience psychological impairment as severe as someone with more severe dysarthria.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2017-01-06 12:49:33 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Behavioural interventions by a speech and language therapist or speech language pathologist are the mainstay of dysarthria treatment. The primary aim is to maximise the patient's ability to communicate with others. UK treatment guidelines for dysarthria (<LINK REF="REF-Taylor_x002d_Goh-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Taylor-Goh 2005</LINK>) recommend that behavioural interventions address all dimensions of the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) Framework; impairment, activity and participation (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2001</LINK>). Impairment level exercises to improve the strength, speed, or function of the impaired musculature may be used. These are usually non-speech and oro-motor movements of affected muscles or muscle groups. This may include external stimulation of the muscles such as applying ice packs, brushing the skin, acupuncture (traditional and electrical), or transcranial magnetic stimulation of the brain. At the activity level, compensatory strategies to increase intelligibility through purposeful speech production such as over-articulation or slowing rate of speech may be used. In addition alternative ways to communicate, or support speech, may be used such as an alphabet chart or computers with artificial voice software. Participation level approaches may use facilitated group work, education, and feedback to support the psychological health of people living with dysarthria or advice to a communication partner may be implemented.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2017-01-06 12:52:38 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The interventions at the impairment level in the <LINK TAG="INTERVENTION" TYPE="SECTION">Description of the intervention</LINK> are likely to be focused on the recovery of impaired movement through exercises to increase strength, range, precision and speed of movement required for speech. Treatment can utilise non-speech or more typically speech-focused movement tasks. Intervention for limb rehabilitation indicates some association between muscle strength and function of movement (<LINK REF="REF-Langhorne-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Langhorne 2009</LINK>) but it is not known whether this is the case for muscles involved in speech. Interventions may examine intensity of intervention and may compare quantity, duration and frequency of input. We know from post-stroke research more generally that increased intensity of treatment may be a key element in recovery but the optimum frequency, duration and quantity of intervention is not known (<LINK REF="REF-Intercollegiate-Stroke-Working-Party-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Intercollegiate Stroke Working Party 2016</LINK>).</P>
<P>The interventions at the activity and participation level as outlined in the <LINK TAG="INTERVENTION" TYPE="SECTION">Description of the intervention</LINK> are likely to focus on strategies or patient specific goals to improve speech intelligibility that relate to a meaningful communication activity for that person. Stroke guidance suggests that goal setting should be used as a rehabilitation tool (<LINK REF="REF-Intercollegiate-Stroke-Working-Party-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Intercollegiate Stroke Working Party 2016</LINK>).This may include reducing rate of speech when talking on the phone, employing purposeful use of speech intonation to distinguish statements from questions in conversation, or advice to the key communication partner. Group or individual work to target confidence in use of communication is another treatment approach, which may incorporate principles of psychological interventions such as motivational interviewing. Environmental modification and education can also be utilised to optimise communication ease and success in a given context such as a family, hospital or nursing home setting. </P>

<P>The primary outcome measure for this review was the long-term effectiveness of the dysarthria intervention on everyday speech (activity level, persisting effect) compared with any control (another intervention, attention control or placebo, or no intervention). Attempts to objectively measure everyday speech are usually based on listener perception grading scales such as dysarthria therapy outcome measures (<LINK REF="REF-Enderby-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Enderby 1997</LINK>) or the communication effectiveness measure (<LINK REF="REF-Mackenzie-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mackenzie 2007</LINK>). We defined evidence of a persistent beneficial effect as around six months post-intervention extracted as measures taken between three and nine months post-intervention.</P>
<P>When trials used more than one outcome measure at the activity level, we took the primary outcome as specified by the trial investigators. If a trial had not specified a primary outcome measure, we checked if a measure of functional communication had been used at the specified time points.</P>

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2017-01-05 12:19:19 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Three authors (CM, AB, PC) independently carried out the assessment of risk of bias and methodological quality within the pairs assigned for data extraction. The authors used Cochrane's 'Risk of bias' tool (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). We examined the studies for the following quality criteria: random sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding of outcome assessors, incomplete outcome data, and selective reporting.</P>
<P>For random sequence generation (selection bias), we considered trials to be low risk if the random component was clearly described, at high risk of bias where randomisation was influenced by the availability of the intervention, or an unclear risk where there was insufficient information to decide. For allocation concealment (selection bias), we considered trials adequately concealed if the process made clear that participants and investigators could not possibly predict allocation. We considered a study to be at high risk if there was a possibility that allocation could be predicted (e.g. open random allocation schedule, open computer systems potentially accessible to the investigator), or where concealment was unclear and the study author was unable to provide sufficient information or did not respond.</P>
<P>It was accepted that the participants and the therapists delivering the intervention could not be blinded to the intervention. Thus, we considered blinding in terms of outcome assessment (performance bias and detection bias) and we considered studies to be at a low risk of bias if the outcome assessor was clearly blinded to the intervention; we considered studies to be at a high risk of bias if this was not the case, the blinding could be broken and an unclear risk of bias if there was insufficient information provided.</P>
<P>We considered incomplete outcome data (attrition bias) a low risk if there were:</P>
<UL>
<LI>no missing outcome data;</LI>
<LI>missing outcome data that were unlikely to be related to true outcome;</LI>
<LI>missing outcome data that were balanced in numbers across intervention groups;</LI>
<LI>similar reasons for missing data across groups; and</LI>
<LI>missing data that had been imputed using appropriate methods that did not affect outcome and were reported as such.</LI>
</UL>
<P>We considered studies to be at a high risk of bias if they did not address:</P>
<UL>
<LI>incomplete outcome data adequately;</LI>
<LI>missing outcome data likely to be related to the true outcome;</LI>
<LI>imbalance of numbers or reasons for missing data across the intervention groups;</LI>
<LI>effect size among missing outcomes to induce clinically relevant bias;</LI>
<LI>an intention-to-treat analysis done with substantial differences of the intervention received.</LI>
</UL>
<P>We considered selective reporting (reporting bias) within studies included in the review. We considered whether studies had reported all outcome data compared with their planned protocols (published or unpublished) where possible. Where this was not possible, we asked study authors for additional information on planned outcome reporting prior to the study. We considered study authors who did not respond to this request an unclear risk.</P>

<P>The population in both studies was people with stroke, both interventions and attention control were delivered at the same time, soon after stroke, within the first two months (<LINK REF="STD-Kwon-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Kwon 2015</LINK>), and within the first four months (<LINK REF="STD-Bowen-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Bowen 2012</LINK>).</P>
<P>Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation treatment duration was five days per week for two weeks (<LINK REF="STD-Kwon-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Kwon 2015</LINK>). Enhanced speech therapy was conducted for a maximum of 16 weeks, with duration and frequency as clinically indicated up to a maximum of three times per week (<LINK REF="STD-Bowen-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Bowen 2012</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Bowen-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Bowen 2012</LINK> mentioned homework, which was given as appropriate to people in the intervention arm, but not to the attention control arm participants. The unpublished intervention manual provided by the <LINK REF="STD-Bowen-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Bowen 2012</LINK> study authors, includes a sheet to encourage documentation of homework by participants, but there is no further description of whether homework was carried out or completed. Participants in the intervention arm discussed homework and its impact during interviews conducted as part of the qualitative aspect of this study. <LINK REF="STD-Kwon-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Kwon 2015</LINK> describes that both groups had the same speech therapy intervention carried out for 30 minutes, five days per week for the two weeks of rTMS treatment. The content of the speech therapy intervention was not described, although it was carried out by a skilled speech therapist. There was no mention of homework in <LINK REF="STD-Kwon-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Kwon 2015</LINK>. Participants in the study by <LINK REF="STD-Kwon-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Kwon 2015</LINK> were not aware of the intervention type they were randomised to receive - either the active repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation or the attention control sham therapy.</P>
<P>The outcome measure for <LINK REF="STD-Kwon-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Kwon 2015</LINK> was a blinded assessment of impairment level immediately post intervention. Participants in <LINK REF="STD-Bowen-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Bowen 2012</LINK> were aware of the intervention type they were randomised to receive; the primary outcome was a blinded assessment of activity level functioning at six months post-entry to the study.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Intervention A compared with intervention B</HEADING>
<P>Three trials, involving a total of 117 randomised participants, compared one intervention with another intervention (<LINK REF="STD-Mackenzie-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Mackenzie 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wenke-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Wenke 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Xu-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Xu 2010</LINK>). All three studies compared usual care versus an alternative intervention (<LINK REF="STD-Mackenzie-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Mackenzie 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wenke-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Wenke 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Xu-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Xu 2010</LINK>). There were no trials that compared one intervention with the same intervention but with variations in timing, duration, or intensity of delivery.</P>
<P>Intervention A in <LINK REF="STD-Wenke-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Wenke 2010</LINK> was Lee Silverman Voice Treatment (LSVT) which aims to increase vocal loudness. In <LINK REF="STD-Xu-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Xu 2010</LINK>, intervention A was acupuncture; and in <LINK REF="STD-Mackenzie-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Mackenzie 2014</LINK> 10 minutes of non-speech oro-motor exercises (tongue and lip movements) replaced 10 minutes word and sentence practice.</P>
<P>Intervention A was delivered by the same speech pathologist trained in LSVT in <LINK REF="STD-Wenke-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Wenke 2010</LINK>; traditional Chinese medical specialists carried out acupuncture in <LINK REF="STD-Xu-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Xu 2010</LINK>; and the same experienced speech and language therapist provided treatment in <LINK REF="STD-Mackenzie-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Mackenzie 2014</LINK>.</P>
<P>Intervention B in all three studies was usual care.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Wenke-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Wenke 2010</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Mackenzie-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Mackenzie 2014</LINK> described intervention B as behavioural therapy, addressing impairment and activity levels of functioning. Both studies provided sufficient information to enable replication of the therapy. <LINK REF="STD-Xu-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Xu 2010</LINK>, did not describe intervention B in sufficient detail to enable replication; there was no information around the content of the therapy, level of impairment, or how therapy was delivered.</P>
<P>Intervention B was delivered by an experienced speech pathologist in <LINK REF="STD-Wenke-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Wenke 2010</LINK>; the same hearing and speech specialist delivered the usual care to participants in both arms in <LINK REF="STD-Xu-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Xu 2010</LINK>; and the same experienced speech and language therapist delivered both intervention A and B in <LINK REF="STD-Mackenzie-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Mackenzie 2014</LINK>.</P>
<P>Treatment timing was for people in the chronic phase of recovery following stroke or brain injury of more than six months or more than three months in <LINK REF="STD-Wenke-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Wenke 2010</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Mackenzie-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Mackenzie 2014</LINK> respectively. In <LINK REF="STD-Xu-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Xu 2010</LINK> timing ranged for people with acute to chronic dysarthria of between one and 12 months post stroke.</P>
<P>Treatment duration ranged from four weeks (<LINK REF="STD-Wenke-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Wenke 2010</LINK>), to eight weeks (<LINK REF="STD-Mackenzie-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Mackenzie 2014</LINK>) and nine weeks (<LINK REF="STD-Xu-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Xu 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>Treatment frequency for interventions A and B was the same for <LINK REF="STD-Wenke-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Wenke 2010</LINK>, at one hour per day, four days a week, and the same for <LINK REF="STD-Mackenzie-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Mackenzie 2014</LINK> at 40 minutes once a week. <LINK REF="STD-Xu-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Xu 2010</LINK> differed, with both arms receiving speech therapy for 30 minutes, five times per week but intervention A was delivered for four weeks, with a week long break followed by four weeks of intervention A.</P>
<P>Independent practice of homework was described in <LINK REF="STD-Wenke-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Wenke 2010</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Mackenzie-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Mackenzie 2014</LINK> but was not used in <LINK REF="STD-Xu-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Xu 2010</LINK>. In <LINK REF="STD-Wenke-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Wenke 2010</LINK>, independent, daily homework was suggested between sessions for intervention B group participants only, but whether this was carried out and recorded was not described. In <LINK REF="STD-Mackenzie-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Mackenzie 2014</LINK>, participants in both intervention A and B were encouraged to carry out independent practice of their allocated intervention of around 30 minutes, five days a week during the seven between session practice weeks for a total of 1050 minutes. This was documented by participants in a diary and the results reported and analysed.</P>
<P>All participants in the three studies were aware of which intervention they were randomised to, none of the three studies had a primary outcome measure.</P>
<P>All three studies carried out an activity level measure, with this being considered to show persistent change for <LINK REF="STD-Wenke-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Wenke 2010</LINK> at six months post treatment, and <LINK REF="STD-Mackenzie-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Mackenzie 2014</LINK> at two months post intervention in a chronic population, but was only carried out immediately post intervention in <LINK REF="STD-Xu-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Xu 2010</LINK>.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Outcomes</HEADING>
<P>All five studies used different outcome measures and at various time points. The primary outcome for this review was to examine the persisting effect of the intervention at the activity level of functioning.</P>
<P>Four studies carried out activity level measures (<LINK REF="STD-Bowen-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Bowen 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mackenzie-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Mackenzie 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wenke-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Wenke 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Xu-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Xu 2010</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Kwon-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Kwon 2015</LINK> did not carry out a measure of activity level of functioning.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Wenke-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Wenke 2010</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Xu-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Xu 2010</LINK> used a measure of perceived intelligibility by a speech and language therapist, <LINK REF="STD-Bowen-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Bowen 2012</LINK> used the dysarthria therapy outcome measures (<LINK REF="REF-Enderby-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Enderby 1997</LINK>), and <LINK REF="STD-Mackenzie-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Mackenzie 2014</LINK> used the communication effectiveness measure (<LINK REF="REF-Mackenzie-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mackenzie 2007</LINK>) and the Speech Intelligibility Test (<LINK REF="REF-Yorkston-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yorkston 1996</LINK>). The only study that specified the primary outcome measure was <LINK REF="STD-Bowen-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Bowen 2012</LINK>.</P>
<P>For our analyses of persisting outcome, we took data from measures carried out at three to nine months post intervention; this included <LINK REF="STD-Wenke-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Wenke 2010</LINK> (six months post treatment) and <LINK REF="STD-Bowen-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Bowen 2012</LINK> (measured at six months post randomisation). <LINK REF="STD-Mackenzie-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Mackenzie 2014</LINK> carried out the final outcome measure at two months (eight weeks) post intervention. The review authors discussed if these data should be included, because this was a chronic population with proximity to the proposed minimum time point of three months (12 weeks). We decided that the proposed time criterion (three months to nine months) in the review protocol was too tight, and agreed to relax timings to include the study data as a persisting effect. This change is reported in <LINK TAG="PRO_REV_DIFF" TYPE="SECTION">Differences between protocol and review</LINK>. The latest time point for the primary outcome measure, taken by <LINK REF="STD-Xu-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Xu 2010</LINK>, was immediately post intervention, which did not meet our requirement of three to nine months post intervention to examine persistent change.</P>
<P>The secondary outcomes were other measures at various time points. This meant we examined data from the activity level measures at immediate time point post-intervention, and this had been carried out by <LINK REF="STD-Wenke-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Wenke 2010</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Xu-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Xu 2010</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Mackenzie-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Mackenzie 2014</LINK>. We considered 'immediate' measure to have been carried out at the end of the treatment period or the time period nearest to the end of treatment.</P>
<P>Communication impairment measures were used in four studies (<LINK REF="STD-Kwon-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Kwon 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mackenzie-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Mackenzie 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wenke-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Wenke 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Xu-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Xu 2010</LINK>). These were articulatory precision (<LINK REF="STD-Wenke-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Wenke 2010</LINK>), maximum phonation time (<LINK REF="STD-Xu-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Xu 2010</LINK>), lip and tongue movements from the Frenchay dysarthria assessment (FDA-2) (<LINK REF="STD-Mackenzie-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Mackenzie 2014</LINK>), and an articulation test (<LINK REF="STD-Kwon-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Kwon 2015</LINK>). These impairment measures were carried out to show persistent effect between the three month and nine month time points by <LINK REF="STD-Wenke-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Wenke 2010</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Mackenzie-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Mackenzie 2014</LINK>, but not <LINK REF="STD-Xu-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Xu 2010</LINK> or <LINK REF="STD-Kwon-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Kwon 2015</LINK>. These measures were carried out immediately post-intervention by all four studies (<LINK REF="STD-Kwon-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Kwon 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mackenzie-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Mackenzie 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wenke-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Wenke 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Xu-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Xu 2010</LINK>). Measures at the participation level were used by <LINK REF="STD-Bowen-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Bowen 2012</LINK>, which used the Communication Outcomes after Stroke Scale (COAST; <LINK REF="REF-Long-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Long 2008</LINK>), and <LINK REF="STD-Mackenzie-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Mackenzie 2014</LINK>, which used the Communicative Effectiveness Survey (CES; <LINK REF="REF-Donovan-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Donovan 2007</LINK>). Both studies applied this participation level measure as a persistent measure of change between three month and nine months, but only <LINK REF="STD-Mackenzie-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Mackenzie 2014</LINK> applied this immediately post treatment.</P>

<P>We included five studies that involved a total of 234 randomised participants. Comparisons were analysed according to our primary outcome of persisting effects of communication at activity level (three RCTs, 116 participants). Comparisons were further analysed for measurement of impairment and participation at immediate and persistent time points. Data were also considered for one subgroup of people with stroke because there were insufficient data for any other clinical subgroups.</P>

<LINK REF="CMP-003.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.1</LINK> included two studies of 56 participants comparing intervention A versus B, with a measure of persisting effects at the activity level: SMD 0.38 (95% CI -0.15 to 0.91) indicating no effect of intervention (<LINK REF="STD-Mackenzie-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Mackenzie 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wenke-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Wenke 2010</LINK>).

<P>We examined the effectiveness of dysarthria interventions for people with speech problems due to stroke and other adult-acquired, non-progressive brain injury. We have built on the work of <LINK REF="REF-Sellars-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sellars 2005</LINK> presented in the previous version of this review, by amending and updating objectives and review outcomes to reflect a more global perspective, and to consider new evidence. We considered whether dysarthria interventions were effective when compared with any control, whether the dysarthria intervention was more effective than an attention control, whether one type of dysarthria intervention was more effective than another, or whether one type of dysarthria intervention was more effective than the same intervention when delivered in a different way. We included five studies and presented data from 234 randomised participants.</P>
<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-12-20 15:29:18 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>See: <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>. Meta-analyses demonstrated no evidence of a statistically significant persisting effect of dysarthria intervention compared with any control when communication was measured at either the activity (three studies, 116 participants), impairment (two studies, 56 participants), or participation level (two studies, 79 participants). This lack of effect did not change in the sensitivity analyses of only the studies with a low risk of bias (two studies, 92 participants), when the analysis was restricted to those with an attention control/placebo (one study, 60 participants), or to the subgroup of those with an underlying condition of stroke (three trials, 106 participants). Similarly, there was no evidence for the immediate effect of dysarthria intervention at the activity level (three studies, 117 participants) or participation level (one study, 32 participants). The one significant finding at the impairment level immediately post-intervention, (four trials, 99 participants) means that clinically there may be some improvement of tongue and lip movement for example but there is no evidence that these persist long-term and the very small numbers and very low quality of the evidence make this an uncertain estimate.</P>

<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2017-01-06 13:24:58 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We only identified five, small trials which indicates the evidence base is limited. In addition to the limited number of trials there were only small numbers of participants within the trials and there were also issues around quality and risk of bias. There is clearly much more that needs to be done before the objectives of the review can be fully addressed. The wide variety of outcome measures, where none of the five trials used any of the same outcome measures, indicates a need for consensus amongst researchers, people with dysarthria and clinicians to identify which measures should be used in future research. However the included studies were all relevant to the review question in that they were all RCTs of dysarthria intervention for stroke and brain injury. The review set out to establish the evidence for all clinical groups who may have dysarthria but we found no RCTs for other types of non-progressive brain injury that may cause dysarthria. One of the studies excluded people with severe dysarthria and one did not report severity so generalisation to the wider dysarthric population could be affected. </P>
<P>There were variable amounts of information relating to intervention and control description and replicability according to the TIDieR checklist that we used when evaluating the studies (<LINK REF="REF-Hoffmann-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hoffmann 2014</LINK>). In two of the studies this was clearly described in sufficient detail for replication (<LINK REF="STD-Bowen-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Bowen 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mackenzie-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Mackenzie 2014</LINK>). There was less detail in <LINK REF="STD-Wenke-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Wenke 2010</LINK>, although the LSVT intervention used in this study cannot be described as the treatment is trademarked and not available publicly. <LINK REF="STD-Xu-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Xu 2010</LINK> gave minimal information about the usual care interventions in both arms, and this could not be replicated from the information given but they provided much more detail about the acupuncture delivery. <LINK REF="STD-Kwon-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Kwon 2015</LINK> gave detail around the transcranial magnetic stimulation intervention and how the sham/attention control was carried out. There was no detail around the speech therapy that was given to both groups to ensure they had the same treatment alongside the transcranial magnetic stimulation intervention and sham. There was variation in reporting whether the intervention was provided as intended by the protocol and this is detailed in <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK> . Fidelity of the intervention and how this was monitored was not described in <LINK REF="STD-Wenke-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Wenke 2010</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Xu-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Xu 2010</LINK> or <LINK REF="STD-Kwon-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Kwon 2015</LINK> which is important when considering applicability of the evidence. Fidelity to the interventions and attention control was described in detail, including information about how this was monitored, who carried this out, when and how, in <LINK REF="STD-Bowen-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Bowen 2012</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Mackenzie-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Mackenzie 2014</LINK>. Whether participants completed the intervention in the arm to which they were allocated was described in <LINK REF="STD-Bowen-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Bowen 2012</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Mackenzie-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Mackenzie 2014</LINK>. Current practice in the UK around rehabilitation continues to focus on early intervention and the review included three studies of early intervention whereas the other two considered intervention with a chronic population. </P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2016-12-20 16:24:53 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review shows that we do not have a robust enough body of evidence to draw firm conclusions about the objectives of this review. It is a measure of progress that there were recent studies that could be included in the meta-analyses however we rated evidence quality for the key outcomes as low or very low (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>). The primary objective of this review was reported by only three of the studies (116 participants; <LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>). However, none of the three studies were adequately powered to enable comparisons of the interventions because of the small numbers of participants. <LINK REF="STD-Bowen-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Bowen 2012</LINK>, while adequately powered to look at early communication intervention in aphasia and dysarthria, was not adequately powered to evaluate dysarthria intervention only. All secondary outcomes were downgraded due to small participant numbers and imprecision.</P>
<P>Only <LINK REF="STD-Bowen-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Bowen 2012</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Mackenzie-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Mackenzie 2014</LINK> had low risk of bias; the other three studies all had areas of unclear risk or high risk. We carried out sensitivity analyses to remove any studies with high or unclear risk of bias but this did not alter the direction or the significance of the results (<LINK REF="CMP-001.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.4</LINK>). The one significant finding was from four studies where we considered the overall quality of the evidence to be very low, which raises concerns around how confident we can feel about this estimate of effect (<LINK REF="CMP-002.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.2</LINK>). The main message about the quality of the evidence found in this review is that, in addition to being adequately powered, the reporting of RCTs must adhere to the CONSORT guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 2010</LINK>) and follow the template for intervention description and replication (TIDieR; <LINK REF="REF-Hoffmann-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hoffmann 2014</LINK>).</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2017-01-06 13:26:41 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The search strategy was broadened for this review to include trials that may have been carried out by a range of professionals or non-professionals and we felt confident that we used search terms to reflect this broad scope. However, not knowing what potential professional or non-professional groups may be carrying out research may introduce the possibility of bias particularly where unpublished literature or ongoing trials were sought, as only those who have worked or are working in the field of dysarthria were approached.</P>
<P>The search strategy was in line with this broad approach and we documented reasons for study exclusions. We carried out searches with no time restrictions: the searches were all carried out in English language databases, and although we imposed no language restrictions, and had a paper published in Chinese (<LINK REF="STD-Xu-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Xu 2010</LINK>) translated, this may have restricted our search method. It is highly probable that papers published in other languages were not identified, and this review may be biased toward English-speaking research studies. <LINK REF="STD-Xu-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Xu 2010</LINK> was published in Chinese and data extraction was carried out by two independent Chinese-speaking individuals, but neither were involved in the review team; discrepancies with data extraction may have occurred. There was some need for interpretation of information, which may not be entirely as intended by the author. Where clarification could not be obtained from study authors, it is possible that information may have been interpreted incorrectly, and that the review is biased until information can be clarified.</P>
<P>Data collection was carried out by individual review authors and then compared in an attempt to reduce any bias around particular methodologies or intervention approaches. To ensure risk of bias judgements were carried out fairly this was considered independently and then compared and discussed by the review team.</P>
<P>The review team was conscious that a review author (AB) was also the lead author of an included study. We considered how to approach this before starting the review, should the study be eligible for inclusion. The review was structured to ensure the study author was not involved in assessing or making judgements about her own study. However, AB provided additional information and data when requested, and contributed her opinion to wider discussions where this was relevant. We were very conscious of the potential for bias in this particular situation and took steps to reduce bias as much as possible.</P>

<P>Research evidence is not yet sufficiently robust to guide clinical practice. It is therefore important for clinicians to continue to offer rehabilitation for people with dysarthria in line with current clinical guidelines. </P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2016-12-06 14:39:56 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>Further research will need to be appropriately designed to avoid risk of bias, and evaluate persisting effects on activity level measures.</P>
<P>The absence of evidence for dysarthria interventions highlights the paucity of research for this distressing condition, and need for adequately-powered, methodologically-sound and well-reported studies.</P>
<P>Although inclusion of five studies (from none 10 years ago) is to be celebrated, much more needs to be done. Dysarthria research activity is in striking contrast to aphasia research, which has now amassed 57 trials of speech and language therapy interventions for aphasia following stroke (<LINK REF="REF-Brady-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brady 2016</LINK>).</P>
<P>Future dysarthria trials should clearly report methods governing randomisation, allocation concealment, clarity around attrition, and include evidence of full reporting of all outcomes. Where possible, blinding of outcome assessment is desirable, but is not always possible to achieve in rehabilitation research. When considering methodological approaches, researchers may want to consider a range of control groups such as comparing interventions with no treatment, or alternative treatment, or an attention control. These control arms answer different but important questions.</P>
<P>It is important to consider follow-up and intention-to-treat analysis: these are important factors in minimising bias.</P>
<P>Rehabilitation trialists will find it helpful to adhere to the CONSORT guidelines for all future studies. Future definitive trials must have adequate statistical power to detect clinically meaningful differences and this may be informed by feasibility and pilot trials.</P>
<P>It would be helpful if researchers could agree core outcome sets and timing of measurements. Interventions should be clearly described and replicable, and researchers would benefit from adherence to the TIDieR checklist.</P>
<P>Future studies should include patients' and carers' views on the available interventions and the most meaningful way of measuring treatment effects. Patients' and carers' views on acceptability of available interventions and acceptability measures (adherence or satisfaction scales) should be considered in future studies. The involvement of patients and carers in commissioning and designing research would greatly increase the quality of the research discussion especially related to potential interventions and possible outcome measures. We found no studies considering timing, intensity, and duration of interventions, which are concepts of clinical importance that need to be considered in future research.</P>

<P>The title of this review was changed from "Speech and language therapy for dysarthria due to non-progressive brain damage" to reflect the broader scope of the search, which is intended to have a more global reach. The search terms for this review now include interventions carried out by any health professional, people with dysarthria, or a trained individual (whether voluntary, employed, or family member) or any other possible approaches to delivery. This review has considered any type of intervention for acquired dysarthria including behavioural or psychological approaches, use of devices and medication, with the exception of surgical intervention. This review was also designed to reflect the international levels of functioning including impairment, activity, and participation level effects (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2001</LINK>). We included an examination of risk of bias in this review in accordance with current Cochrane methodology (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). This review now has a summary of findings table which includes the five GRADE considerations to assess the quality of the body of evidence of the studies included in the meta-analysis using GRADEproGDT software (<LINK REF="REF-GRADEproGDT-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">GRADEproGDT 2015</LINK>). The primary outcome in the protocol was to examine long-term, persistent effectiveness between three and nine months post-intervention, but during the review process, we found this time criterion was too restrictive. Following discussion among review authors the timings were relaxed to include <LINK REF="STD-Mackenzie-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Mackenzie 2014</LINK>, which was felt to be the most appropriate way forward, but this was a change from the original protocol.</P>

<LI>Intervention:</LI>
<UL>
<LI>this procedure was carried out as part of the intervention to establish motor-evoked potentials. To determine the resting motor threshold and stimulation area, motor-evoked potentials were recorded from the orbicularis oris muscles on each participant's non-affected side using transcranial magnetic stimulation. Focal transcranial magnetic stimulation was applied using a Magstim Rapid magnetic stimulator (Magstim Company Ltd, Dyfed, UK). Briefly, a Magstim circular coil (external diameter, 90 mm) was placed onto each participant's contralateral motor cortex to identify the hotspot, defined as the area that produced the largest amplitude of motor-evoked potentials. The resting motor threshold was defined as the stimulus intensity required to produce motor-evoked potentials &gt; 100 kV at a peak-to-peak amplitude during 3 of 5 consecutive trials on the orbicularis oris</LI>
<LI>the experimental intervention was LF stimulation, which involved being seated in a comfortable chair with foam ear plugs, each participant was treated with 10 consecutive sessions (5 times per week for 2 weeks) of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation, performed by a physiatrist who used a 70 mm, air cooled, figure-of-eight Y-shaped coil. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation was performed at a low frequency (1 Hz), at 90% amplitude of evoked motor threshold, and with 1,500 stimulations/day on the hotspot</LI>

<P>We were able to classify incomplete outcome data as low risk following discussion with the study author. They clarified that they had statistically analysed their findings appropriately and this had not affected the results: </P>
<P>"Group A versus Group B difference was not indicated on any of the four measures, based on data for 32 completing participants: SIT <I>F</I>(1, 30)=1.46, <I>p</I>=0.24; CEM <I>F</I>(1, 30) = 2.39, <I>p </I>= 0.13, CES <I>F</I>(1, 30) = 0.58, <I>p </I>= 0.45; FDA-2 <I>F</I>(1, 30) = 2.61, <I>p </I>= 0.12. There was no significant interaction between group allocation and assessment point on any of the four measures for these participants: SIT <I>F</I>(3, 90) = 0.88, <I>p </I>= 0.97; CEM <I>F</I>(3, 90) = 0.34, <I>p </I>= 0.80; CES <I>F</I>(3, 90) = 0.16, <I>p </I>= 0.92; FDA <I>F</I>(3, 90) = 0.12, <I>p </I>= 0.95. In view of the scale nature of the CEM measure, non-parametric analysis was also undertaken and provided similar results. Imputation of results for seven additional cases with incomplete intervention and/or post-intervention assessments, by last observation carried forward and multiple imputation provided similar results for all measures."</P>

<P>ReaDySpeech for people with dysarthria after stroke: protocol for a feasibility RCT</P>
</CHAR_STUDY_NAME>
<CHAR_METHODS MODIFIED="2016-12-06 14:41:21 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>A feasibility RCT will recruit 36 people with post-stroke dysarthria who are more than 1 week post-stroke. Participants will be externally randomised in a 2:1 ratio to receive either ReaDySpeech and usual care (24 participants) or usual care only (12 participants). This study is single blind with the researcher carrying out the baseline and outcome measures blinded to treatment allocation. The primary objective is to assess the feasibility of conducting a definitive trial. Secondary objectives include recruitment rate, and determining: numbers of eligible patients recruited and reasons for non-recruitment; loss of participants to follow-up and reasons; acceptability of randomisation and the intervention; adherence to the intervention; acceptability of outcome measures; defining 'usual' care; and the implications of the intervention for the patient/family/carer</P>

<CHAR_INTERVENTIONS MODIFIED="2016-12-06 14:41:22 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>ReaDySpeech is an online programme which delivers articulation exercises to improve breathing; intonation; facial expression; rate of speech; and oro-motor control (including range of movement, strength and speed). ReaDySpeech is set up and amended by the treating therapist according to the participant's progress. The participant accesses these exercises online, via any Wi-Fi enabled device (smart phone, tablet computer, laptop computer or personal computer). It can be used in a variety of ways: as part of face-to-face therapy during a session with a speech and language therapist or a therapy assistant, or the participant can use it independently outside of the therapy sessions, with or without the support of family or carers. The therapists select clinically relevant exercises and negotiate agreed intensity and duration of use with the participant, adherence to which is monitored by the software programme which will record the exercises selected by the therapist. Therapists will have an instruction booklet with screen shots to support their use of ReaDySpeech. The proof of concept work has shown that ReaDySpeech can be delivered by any qualified speech and language therapist of any level of experience. In this trial, participating therapists will use ReaDySpeech with participants who meet the inclusion criteria alongside 'usual' care for a maximum of 10 weeks. No specifications about the intensity of ReaDySpeech care will be made and this will be decided according to the therapist's clinical judgement in consultation with the participant</P>
