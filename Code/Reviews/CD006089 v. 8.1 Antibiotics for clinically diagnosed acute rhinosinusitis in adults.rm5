<P>Acute rhinosinusitis is a common condition that involves blockage of the nose passage and mucus in the sinuses. The diagnosis of acute rhinosinusitis in this review is based on clinical symptoms only, i.e. purulent discharge from the nose or other rhinosinusitis-like symptoms, such as unilateral facial pain or pressure, pain when bending forward, pain in the upper teeth or when chewing, and post-nasal drip. It is often caused by a viral upper respiratory tract infection of which only 0.5% to 2% of cases are estimated to be complicated by a bacterial rhinosinusitis. Nevertheless, antibiotics (used to treat bacterial infections) are often prescribed. Unnecessary prescribing contributes to antimicrobial resistance in the community. Therefore, in order to provide clinicians and patients with evidence-based guidance for management, it is important to assess the effect of antibiotics in acute rhinosinusitis.</P>
<P>We found 10 trials with a low risk of bias involving 2450 participants. Overall, about half of all participants were cured after one week with antibiotic or placebo treatment and three-quarters were cured after 14 days. Antibiotics can shorten the time to cure, but only five more participants per 100 will cure faster after 7 to 14 days if they receive antibiotics instead of placebo, or 18 participants will need to be treated with antibiotics for one extra patient to be cured more quickly. However, for every eight patients treated with antibiotics one patient experiences an adverse event caused by the treatment. The rate of serious complications was very low in both the placebo and antibiotic treatment groups.</P>
<P>Given the lack of clear benefit in terms of rapid recovery and the increase in side effects in participants treated with antibiotics, antibiotics are not recommended as first line treatment in adults with clinically diagnosed acute rhinosinusitis. This review cannot make recommendations for treatment of children, patients with a suppressed immune system and patients with severe disease as these populations were not included in the available trials. More studies are needed to identify which patients might benefit from antibiotics.</P>

<P>We included 10 trials involving 2450 participants. Overall, the risk of bias in these studies was low. Irrespective of the treatment group, 47% of participants were cured after one week and 71% after 14 days. Antibiotics can shorten the time to cure, but only five more participants per 100 will cure faster at any time point between 7 and 14 days if they receive antibiotics instead of placebo (number needed to treat to benefit (NNTB)) 18 (95% confidence interval (CI) 10 to 115, I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic 0%, eight trials). Purulent secretion resolves faster with antibiotics (odds ratio (OR) 1.58 (95% CI 1.13 to 2.22)), (NNTB 11, 95% CI 6 to 51, I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic 0%, three trials). However, 27% of the participants who received antibiotics and 15% of those who received placebo experienced adverse events (OR 2.10, 95% CI 1.60 to 2.77) (number needed to treat to harm (NNTH)) 8 (95% CI 6 to 13, I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic 13%, seven trials). More participants in the placebo group needed to start antibiotic therapy because of an abnormal course of rhinosinusitis (OR 0.49, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.66), NNTH 20 (95% CI 14 to 35, I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic 0%, eight trials). Only one disease-related complication (brain abscess) occurred in a patient treated with antibiotics.</P>

<P>The potential benefit of antibiotics in the treatment of clinically diagnosed acute rhinosinusitis needs to be seen in the context of a high prevalence of adverse events.

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2012-08-15 07:39:46 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Mieke L van Driel">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2012-08-14 08:22:41 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Mieke L van Driel">
<P>Acute rhinosinusitis is defined as an acute infection of the nasal passages and the paranasal sinuses. It is one of the most common diagnoses made in general practice and one of the most frequent reasons for prescribing antibiotics (<LINK REF="REF-McCaig-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">McCaig 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-USDHHS-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">USDHHS 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Willet-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Willet 1994</LINK>). Rhinosinusitis is a more exact term than sinusitis since it takes into account the fact that inflammation of the sinuses is unlikely to occur without inflammation of the mucous membranes of the nose. The term 'sinusitis' will only be used when inflammation of a specific sinus (confirmed by radiology or ultrasound) is mentioned (for example, maxillary sinusitis). In older studies the term sinusitis is often used when referring to rhinosinusitis. </P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2012-08-15 07:39:46 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Liz Dooley">
<P>In this review, we investigated the effectiveness of antibiotics versus placebo in participants with clinically diagnosed acute rhinosinusitis. Three Cochrane Reviews have previously focused on antibiotic treatment in patients with acute infections of the nose, sinuses or both (<LINK REF="REF-Ahovuo_x002d_Saloranta-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ahovuo-Saloranta 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Arroll-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Arroll 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Morris-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morris 2002</LINK>). One review studied only patients with clinical signs and symptoms of rhinosinusitis lasting at least seven days, or acute maxillary sinusitis confirmed by a radiograph or a computer tomography (<LINK REF="REF-Ahovuo_x002d_Saloranta-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ahovuo-Saloranta 2011</LINK>). In these patients, antibiotics were of limited benefit: antibiotics reduced the risk of clinical failure (lack of total cure) at seven to 15 days follow-up. A second Review looked at the effect of antibiotics in patients with an acute upper respiratory tract infection with less than seven days of symptoms, or acute purulent rhinitis of less than 10 days duration (<LINK REF="REF-Arroll-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Arroll 2010</LINK>). The authors concluded that there was insufficient evidence to warrant the use of antibiotics for upper respiratory tract infections in children or adults presenting with these symptoms. Finally, the <LINK REF="REF-Morris-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morris 2002</LINK> review considered antibiotic treatment in children with persistent nasal discharge. The authors concluded that antibiotics have some benefit in the short- and medium-term in children with purulent rhinorrhoea for more than 10 days, or in older children with radiologically confirmed rhinosinusitis.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2012-08-09 11:36:47 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Acute rhinosinusitis can be caused by a viral or a bacterial infection. Acute viral rhinosinusitis is a viral upper respiratory tract infection (or common cold) which, in the majority of cases, also involves the sinuses. <LINK REF="REF-Gwaltney-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gwaltney 1994</LINK> showed that 87% of patients with a common cold also have sinus abnormalities on a computerised tomography (CT) scan. Antibiotics are unnecessary in viral rhinosinusitis. They contribute to bacterial resistance and, in general, have no beneficial effect (<LINK REF="REF-Hickner-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hickner 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>Only a minority of patients (0.5% to 2%) develop bacterial rhinosinusitis (<LINK REF="REF-Berg-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Berg 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gwaltney-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gwaltney 1996</LINK>). In this instance, antibiotics may be indicated to speed up recovery or prevent suppurative complications. The problem is that the clinical diagnosis of bacterial rhinosinusitis is difficult (<LINK REF="REF-Lindbaeck-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lindbaeck 2002</LINK>). Consequently the notions 'viral' and 'bacterial' are not very workable in daily practice and there is a pressing need to identify, on a clinical basis, those patients who will benefit from antibiotics (<LINK REF="REF-Lanza-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lanza 1997</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2012-08-15 07:39:46 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Mieke L van Driel">
<P>Notwithstanding the above cited reviews, one piece of evidence is still missing. In primary care settings, technical investigations are not routinely performed, nor recommended in patients with nasal or paranasal symptoms (<LINK REF="REF-Hickner-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hickner 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Low-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Low 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-RCRWP-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">RCRWP 2003</LINK>). As a result, in the majority of patients with rhinosinusitis, the diagnosis is based on clinical signs and symptoms. However, previously published Cochrane Reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Ahovuo_x002d_Saloranta-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ahovuo-Saloranta 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Arroll-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Arroll 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Morris-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morris 2002</LINK>) do not cover the group of patients with clinically diagnosed rhinosinusitis and therefore, cannot answer the question as to whether patients should be treated with antibiotics. Individual trials show a trend in favour of antibiotics for these patients. A systematic review may provide a clearer answer and an estimate of the potential effect size.</P>

<P>We considered all trials in which participants with the clinical diagnosis of acute rhinosinusitis were randomly assigned to a treatment with an antibiotic or a placebo. The clinical diagnosis of acute rhinosinusitis was based on the presence of clinical signs or symptoms that are associated with the presence of fluid in the sinuses in diagnostic studies or that are mentioned in clinical practice guidelines as indicating rhinosinusitis. These included: started with a common cold or experiences the two phases of the illness (i.e. catches a cold, feels better after a few days, then feels worse again), purulent nasal discharge, unilateral maxillary pain, pain in the upper teeth, pain when chewing, post-nasal drip, pain on bending forward, and duration of complaints for more than seven days.</P>
<P>The review was limited to studies of adults (18 years of age and older), as studies on children were reviewed by Morris (<LINK REF="REF-Morris-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morris 2002</LINK>). The duration of complaints was 30 days or less to exclude participants with subacute or chronic rhinosinusitis, where the infection is probably not the primary cause of the inflammation (<LINK REF="REF-Bachert-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bachert 2003</LINK>).</P>

<P>One author (ML) carried out the selection of papers on the basis of titles, keywords and abstracts, and excluded trials that clearly did not meet the inclusion criteria of the review. In the selection procedure, we used the following strategy. First, we screened titles and keywords using specific criteria: the study population consisted of adults (we excluded studies with children, animals, cadavers or in vitro research); the main topic of the study was acute rhinosinusitis or upper respiratory tract infection in general (we excluded studies about specific kinds of rhinosinusitis, specific kinds of bacteria, rhinosinusitis in a specific group of patients (e.g. HIV positive patients), rhinosinusitis in surgical settings and chronic sinusitis); randomised controlled trials (RCTs), (we excluded cohort studies, reviews, meta-analyses, case reports, retrospective studies, guidelines, letters to the Editor, editorials, observational trials, comments, qualitative research, case-control studies, and secondary analyses of RCTs); the comparison was antibiotic versus placebo (we excluded studies that compared antibiotics versus antibiotics, other treatment versus placebo, other treatment versus antibiotics, and different lengths or doses of antibiotics); and clinical diagnosis of rhinosinusitis (we excluded studies that included patients diagnosed on the basis of radiography, CT scan, laboratory results, ultrasonography or bacteriology). If the title was not informative, we read the abstract and executed the same selection procedure. If the information relevant to the inclusion criteria was not available in the title, keywords or abstract, or if the title and keywords were not informative and the abstract was not available, we retrieved the full-text of the report. We obtained the full-text of every article considered for inclusion. Two authors (ML, ADS) assessed papers that passed this initial review for inclusion.</P>

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2012-08-09 20:19:01 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Mieke L van Driel">
<P>We assessed the methodological quality of the included studies as described in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011a</LINK>) which evaluates allocation, blinding, incomplete outcome data, selective reporting and other potential sources of bias. Two review authors (ML, ADS) independently categorised studies as low risk of bias (all criteria met to satisfaction), risk of bias (one or more criteria partially met) or high risk of bias (one or more criteria not met). There were no disagreements between the reviews authors.</P>

<P>We performed the analyses comparing antibiotic versus placebo using available data. We asked the trial authors of <LINK REF="STD-Merenstein-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Merenstein 2005</LINK> for information about the allocation process. If the pooling of event rates was not possible because of lack of published data, we compared the published results from the individual trials with the results of the pooled data. If in studies the drop-out rate was over 35% or lower than 35% but with considerable difference in the drop-out rate in the intervention groups, we excluded the study from the analyses. If the study used intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis to impute missing data, we considered on a case by case basis whether the data could be used in the analyses. We discuss this where applicable.</P>

<P>We assessed variability among studies for statistical heterogeneity using The Cochrane Collaboration's test for heterogeneity and the I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic.

<P>We presented cure rates, expressing treatment success (dichotomous variable) at a specific time point, as odds ratios (ORs), reflecting differences in the intervention and control groups, along with the appropriate 95% confidence intervals (CIs), using Review Manager 5.1 (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2011</LINK>). In assessing the influence of missing data on the overall results, we used three ways of imputing data: assuming the outcomes of participants from whom no outcome was recorded 1) as cured, 2) as not cured, or 3) according to the cure rate observed in the control group. Secondly, we calculated ORs for adverse events. If the event rates were below 1%, we used the Peto OR as this method is found to be the least biased and most powerful method providing the best CI coverage if there is no substantial imbalance between treatment and control group sizes within studies, and treatment effects are not exceptionally large, as described in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011b</LINK>).</P>

At the beginning of the study, ultrasound positive and negative participants had similar symptom scores. Varonen et al did not investigate the interaction between the ultrasound result, cure and randomised group. They only reported that in the placebo group, participants who had maxillary sinusitis on the ultrasound seemed to start other antibiotics and seemed to withdraw from the study more often than those with no maxillary sinusitis on ultrasound, but this difference was not statistically significant.

<P>Eight studies (<LINK REF="STD-Bucher-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Bucher 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-De-Sutter-2002" TYPE="STUDY">De Sutter 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kaiser-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Kaiser 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Merenstein-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Merenstein 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Norrelund-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Norrelund 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stalman-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Stalman 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Varonen-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Varonen 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Williamson-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Williamson 2007</LINK>) defined 'cure' (descriptions are reported in <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>). The common denominator of all the definitions was the resolution or improvement of major symptoms, evaluated by the participant alone (<LINK REF="STD-Bucher-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Bucher 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-De-Sutter-2002" TYPE="STUDY">De Sutter 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Merenstein-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Merenstein 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Varonen-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Varonen 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Williamson-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Williamson 2007</LINK>) or by the participant and the investigator (<LINK REF="STD-Kaiser-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Kaiser 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Norrelund-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Norrelund 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stalman-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Stalman 1997</LINK>). As described above in two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Garbutt-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Garbutt 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Meltzer-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Meltzer 2005</LINK>) a difference in symptom score between the antibiotic and placebo group was the primary outcome and could therefore not be included in the pooling.</P>
<P>Our intention-to-treat (ITT) population consisted of 2450 participants. We were able to analyze data of 1687 participants (69%). We excluded <LINK REF="STD-Meltzer-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Meltzer 2005</LINK> (499 participants) and <LINK REF="STD-Garbutt-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Garbutt 2012</LINK> (166 participants) because, as described before, their primary outcome measure was not 'cure'.</P>
<P>Despite the choice of the trial authors, we decided to consider participants who started other antibiotics as treatment failures and not as drop-outs. For <LINK REF="STD-Kaiser-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Kaiser 2001</LINK>, we decided to use the clinical evaluation as criterion for cure.</P>
<P>Irrespective of treatment group, 47% of participants were cured after one week, 49.5% after 10 days, and 71% after 14 days.</P>
<P>The estimated OR for the overall treatment effect of antibiotics relative to placebo was 1.25 (95% CI 1.02 to 1.53, number needed to treat to benefit (NNTB) 18.0 (95% CI 9.7 to 114.9)), I<SUP>2 </SUP>statistic 0% (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>, <LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK>).</P>
<P>We divided the studies into three groups: in the first group cure was assessed at one week (<LINK REF="STD-Bucher-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Bucher 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kaiser-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Kaiser 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Norrelund-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Norrelund 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Williamson-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Williamson 2007</LINK>), in the second group around day 10 (<LINK REF="STD-De-Sutter-2002" TYPE="STUDY">De Sutter 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stalman-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Stalman 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Williamson-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Williamson 2007</LINK>) and in the third group at day 14 (<LINK REF="STD-Bucher-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Bucher 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Merenstein-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Merenstein 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Varonen-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Varonen 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Williamson-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Williamson 2007</LINK>). The heterogeneity among studies was very low (0% at one week and 10 days, and 6% at 14 days).</P>
<P>There were no significant differences between the treatment groups: after one week, the OR for cure was 1.07 (95% CI 0.81 to 1.41) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>), after 10 days it was 1.18 (95% CI 0.92 to 1.52) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>), and after 14 days it was 1.48 (95% CI 0.99 to 2.23) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.4</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Meltzer-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Meltzer 2005</LINK> did not find any difference in symptom score between the antibiotic and placebo group, so we assumed that adding data from this study would not change our overall result. <LINK REF="STD-Garbutt-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Garbutt 2012</LINK> found a significant difference in symptom score at day seven, favouring amoxicillin (mean difference (MD) between groups 0.19 (95% CI 0.024 to 0.35)). This study also provided data about "significantly improved" participants. Adding this data (<LINK REF="CMP-001.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.5</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-001.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.6</LINK>) did not substantially change the overall result.</P>
<P>For assessment of the influence of missing data on the overall results, three ways of imputing data were used: assuming the outcomes of participants for whom no outcome was recorded 1) as cured, 2) as not cured, or 3) according to the cure rate observed in the control group. Twelve analyses (<LINK REF="CMP-001.07" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.7</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-001.08" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.8</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-001.09" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.9</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-001.10" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.10</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-001.11" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.11</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-001.12" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.12</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-001.13" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.13</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-001.14" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.14</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-001.15" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.15</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-001.16" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.16</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-001.17" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.17</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-001.18" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.18</LINK>) revealed no clear differences with the basic analyses.</P>

Data could be extracted from one study on day eight (<LINK REF="STD-Norrelund-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Norrelund 1978</LINK>) and from two studies on day 10 (<LINK REF="STD-De-Sutter-2002" TYPE="STUDY">De Sutter 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stalman-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Stalman 1997</LINK>). The data for <LINK REF="STD-De-Sutter-2002" TYPE="STUDY">De Sutter 2002</LINK> were provided by the research team. <LINK REF="STD-Meltzer-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Meltzer 2005</LINK> published only least-square means data.

<P>Irrespective of the timing of the endpoint, the estimated OR for the resolution of purulent secretion was 1.58 (95% CI 1.13 to 2.22), NNTB 10.8 (95% CI 6.1 to 50.8) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.19" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.19</LINK>).

<P>Some data on purulent secretion could not be pooled. <LINK REF="STD-Norrelund-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Norrelund 1978</LINK> found in 75% of participants in the antibiotic group and in only 56% in the placebo group at least 50% reduction of secretion on day eight (OR 2.29, 95% CI 1.11 to 4.74, NNTB 5.4, P = 0.002). Furthermore, <LINK REF="STD-De-Sutter-2002" TYPE="STUDY">De Sutter 2002</LINK> found a significant mean symptom change between baseline and 10-day follow-up (P = &lt; 0.0001).

<P>Considering pain in general, no study found a difference in pain duration between the antibiotic and placebo groups (<LINK REF="STD-De-Sutter-2002" TYPE="STUDY">De Sutter 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stalman-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Stalman 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Williamson-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Williamson 2007</LINK>). Full resolution of pain occurred between day four and day seven in most participants. Also, when considering specific types of pain, such as unilateral facial pain (<LINK REF="STD-De-Sutter-2002" TYPE="STUDY">De Sutter 2002</LINK>), pain on bending forward (<LINK REF="STD-De-Sutter-2002" TYPE="STUDY">De Sutter 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stalman-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Stalman 1997</LINK>), pain in upper teeth or when chewing (<LINK REF="STD-De-Sutter-2002" TYPE="STUDY">De Sutter 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stalman-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Stalman 1997</LINK>), facial pain, pressure or tenderness (<LINK REF="STD-De-Sutter-2002" TYPE="STUDY">De Sutter 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Meltzer-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Meltzer 2005</LINK>) and sinus headache (<LINK REF="STD-De-Sutter-2002" TYPE="STUDY">De Sutter 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Meltzer-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Meltzer 2005</LINK>), none of the trials detected a significant difference in pain duration when comparing the antibiotic to the placebo groups.</P>

Also, <LINK REF="STD-Varonen-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Varonen 2003</LINK> did not find a significant difference: the mean illness duration in participants taking antibiotics was 6.0 days, compared with 6.4 days in the placebo group (P = 0.66).</P>

<P>Only one serious disease-related adverse event occurred (<LINK REF="STD-Bucher-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Bucher 2003</LINK>): after two weeks of symptomatic treatment, a participant who was treated for one week with amoxicillin-clavulanate (1 G twice daily) experienced a brain abscess caused by an amoxicillin-clavulanate-sensitive strain of <I>Streptococcus milleri (S. milleri)</I>.

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-08-09 15:21:12 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Mieke L van Driel">
<P>Almost one in two participants with clinically diagnosed acute rhinosinusitis are better within one week, and almost three out of four participants within 14 days. Antibiotics shorten the time to cure, but only five more participants per 100 (range one to 10) would cure faster if they took antibiotics instead of placebo. Antibiotics cannot fasten pain relief or the general feeling of illness. Patients who take antibiotics do not resume their daily activities earlier and do not take less analgesics or nasal decongestants than patients treated with placebo. In patients with purulent rhinorrhoea, 10 more patients per 100 (range three to 17) would experience a faster resolution of nasal discharge if antibiotics were given. However, we found that 12 more patients per 100 (range two to 14) would experience side effects of the treatment. This potential harm needs to be compared to the possible benefit of taking antibiotics in patients with purulent rhinorrhoea. Five fewer patients per 100 (range four to seven) would experience treatment failure if they receive antibiotics instead of placebo (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>).</P>

<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2012-08-14 08:14:00 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Mieke L van Driel">
<P>In this meta-analysis, we investigated if antibiotic therapy could speed up the recovery process in patients with clinically diagnosed acute rhinosinusitis. In the identified randomised controlled trials (RCTs), the main symptoms used for inclusion were the presence of nasal discharge, facial pain and a common cold or upper respiratory tract infection. This is in line with the clinical presentation of rhinosinusitis in patients in primary care. We did not ask the question "do these patients really suffer from rhinosinusitis and how can we prove this?", as this would require technical investigations that are not routinely performed nor recommended in primary care. We were interested in patients diagnosed with 'acute rhinosinusitis' in primary care and the therapy recommended in that case. Based on the populations included in the studies in this review, we can be reasonably confident that this review covers the general population of patients with rhinosinusitis-like complaints. We cannot draw conclusions about the efficacy of antibiotics in children, patients with a suppressed immune system and patients with serious diseases (e.g. very high fever, prolonged symptoms, septic symptoms such as tachycardia, sweating, and low blood pressure) and patients referred to an ear, nose and throat specialist because of the serious course of the disease or fear of complications, who were not included in the trials and are also unlikely to be included in future placebo controlled trials.</P>

<P>We used the GRADE assessment tool for assessing the level of evidence for each outcome and creating the <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>.</P>
<P>For the outcomes 'cure', 'purulent rhinorrhoea', 'side effects', 'diarrhea' and 'treatment failure', we graded the evidence for the result as 'high'. All studies except one were included in one of the three outcomes, depending on study design. The analyses show a consistent result.</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2012-08-09 21:16:50 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Mieke L van Driel">
<P>We carried out a thorough search strategy in several different databases to avoid selection bias. We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) part of <I>The Cochrane Library </I>Issue 2<I>, </I>2012 <I>(</I>www.thecochranelibrary.com) (accessed 10 October 2012), MEDLINE (January 1950 to February week 4, 2012) and EMBASE (January 1974 to February 2012). We used a predefined selection procedure for including and excluding studies and followed this strategy consistently. For each relevant reference we have documented the reason for exclusion. The research questions were predefined and answered in the same sequence.</P>
<P>We read the included studies and summarised the information in the table <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>. We assessed the risk of bias rigorously. It is possible we have given undeserved bad points to two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Meltzer-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Meltzer 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Norrelund-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Norrelund 1978</LINK>) but this does not mean that the studies were performed incorrectly. They were evaluated as poor because there was not enough information available in the article.</P>
<P>In some studies raw data were not reported. In that case we estimated the number of events by multiplying the percentage with the total number of participants in that group to make pooling of results possible. <LINK REF="STD-Stalman-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Stalman 1997</LINK> only mentioned the total cure rate for both groups and stated that there was no difference between both groups. We used the same percentages in both groups for pooling. This assumption could be imprecise, however omitting this data did not substantially change the ORs. <LINK REF="REF-Young-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Young 2008</LINK> had the raw data at their disposal and reported that the exact cure rate was 63% in the placebo group and 66% in the antibiotic group. Using these cure rates in our analysis did not substantially change the ORs (OR 1.27, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.56; NNTB 17, 95% CI 9 to 82) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.23" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.23</LINK>)</P>
<P>The definitions of 'cure' varied in the different trials and this might raise questions about the comparability of the studies, but their underlying interpretation of cure was similar. Besides calculating the overall treatment effect, we divided the studies into three groups: timing of outcome at one week, 10 days and 14 days to assess the effect at various time points.</P>
<P>For the primary outcome 'cure', we checked if inputting missing data in three different ways changed the overall result.</P>
<P>For the secondary outcome 'purulent secretion', data were collected the one time by the patient, the other by clinical inspection. Due to the low number of studies, we did not take this into account.</P>
<P>There was an important variation in choices of antibiotics and dosage schedules. This is possibly due to differences in antibiotic resistance at different time points and in different countries. We assumed that the trial authors' choice of antibiotics was suitable for their countries and local resistance patterns at that point in time. Therefore, we assume this did not influence the effect of the antibiotic treatment on the cure rates, but as bacterial cultures were not performed, we cannot prove this.</P>
<P>As we considered only studies that included patients with clinically diagnosed rhinosinusitis, the proportion of patients with bacterial rhinosinusitis is unknown. However, as described above, we wanted to focus on patients who visited general practitioners with acute rhinosinusitis complaints and who are treated empirically without performing extra technical investigations. This review answers the important clinical question of whether these patients should be treated with antibiotics or not.</P>

This study group found a modest antibiotic benefit for patients with uncomplicated acute rhinosinusitis 7 to 12 days after entering a clinical trial (absolute risk difference (RD) 0.15, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.25, RR 1.28, P = 0.007), based on data from <LINK REF="STD-Bucher-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Bucher 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-De-Sutter-2002" TYPE="STUDY">De Sutter 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gananca-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Gananca 1973</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hansen-2000a" TYPE="STUDY">Hansen 2000a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Haye-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Haye 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kaiser-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Kaiser 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lindbaek-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Lindbaek 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lindbaek-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Lindbaek 1998</LINK>; and <LINK REF="STD-Stalman-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Stalman 1997</LINK>. However, there was a high level of heterogeneity (I<SUP>2 </SUP>statistic 80%). The forest plot clearly shows that the benefit of antibiotics is higher in studies with an inclusion based on technical investigations (NNTB 3). The RD of studies that enrolled subjects with a negative imaging, or based strictly on clinical criteria was 0.03 (95% CI -0.02 to 0.08, NNTB 12.5 to 50). This is in accordance with our results. At 14 to 15 days, there was no longer any statistical benefit (results based on data of <LINK REF="STD-Bucher-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Bucher 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Meltzer-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Meltzer 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Merenstein-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Merenstein 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-van-Buchem-1997a" TYPE="STUDY">van Buchem 1997a</LINK>). Benefits were offset by a relative increase of 83% in adverse events (NNTH 9), which is similar to our calculations.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Young-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Young 2008</LINK> performed a meta-analysis on clinically diagnosed acute rhinosinusitis using individual patient data meta-analysis (IPDMA). An IPDMA is the best way of performing subgroup analyses given that individual patient data of a number of RCTs can be obtained. In this analysis the authors investigated the effect of antibiotics in the subgroup of patients with at least seven days of rhinosinusitis-like symptoms, as guidelines advocate prescribing antibiotics for this patient group (<LINK REF="REF-Hickner-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hickner 2001</LINK>). This IPDMA was completed by further analysis of the effect of antibiotics in patients with specific signs and symptoms, with the aim of identifying patients who benefit most from antibiotic therapy. <LINK REF="REF-Young-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Young 2008</LINK> included the same trials, except for <LINK REF="STD-Norrelund-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Norrelund 1978</LINK>, because they could not get the raw data for the IPDMA and <LINK REF="STD-Garbutt-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Garbutt 2012</LINK> because this trial was not yet published. They included the raw data of <LINK REF="STD-Meltzer-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Meltzer 2005</LINK> and of an identical unpublished trial run by Schering-Plough. The estimated OR for the overall treatment effect of antibiotics relative to placebo was 1.37 (95% CI 1.13 to 1.66, NNTB 15, 95% CI 7 to 190, data IPDMA). The ORs of their analyses of aggregated data were similar (OR 1.35, 95% CI 1.15 to 1.59). This OR for overall treatment effect is slightly higher than in our study, probably due to the favourable results of <LINK REF="STD-Meltzer-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Meltzer 2005</LINK>. <LINK REF="REF-Young-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Young 2008</LINK> found that older patients and patients reporting severe symptoms or longer duration of symptoms took longer to cure but they were no more likely to benefit from treatment than other patients. For other patient-reported symptoms (previous common cold or two stages of illness), pain on bending, unilateral facial pain, pain in the teeth and purulent nasal discharge), estimates were not sufficiently precise to draw any conclusion about their prognostic value. Patients with purulent discharge in the pharynx, ascertained by the physician, seemed to cure slower and to have some non-significant benefit of antibiotics (OR 1.60, 95% CI 0.95 to 2.76, NNTB 8, 95% CI 4 to 47). The same was found for patients with a higher temperature (OR 1.28, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.88). As we did not have the raw data, we could not perform this analysis. <LINK REF="REF-Young-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Young 2008</LINK> did not investigate adverse events.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Falagas-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Falagas 2008</LINK> included trials in adults or children based on clinical diagnosis and/or technical investigations (extra trials: <LINK REF="STD-Gananca-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Gananca 1973</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Garbutt-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Garbutt 2001</LINK> (children); <LINK REF="STD-Hansen-2000a" TYPE="STUDY">Hansen 2000a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Haye-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Haye 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kristo-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kristo 2005</LINK> (children); <LINK REF="STD-Lindbaek-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Lindbaek 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lindbaek-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Lindbaek 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wald-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wald 1986</LINK> (children)). We excluded <LINK REF="STD-Norrelund-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Norrelund 1978</LINK> because of the language barrier. For <LINK REF="STD-Kaiser-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Kaiser 2001</LINK>, we only took into account the subgroup of patients with radiographically confirmed rhinosinusitis. We did not include <LINK REF="STD-Garbutt-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Garbutt 2012</LINK> because this study was not yet published. <LINK REF="REF-Falagas-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Falagas 2008</LINK> found a higher cure rate in patients taking antibiotics compared to placebo (OR 1.82, 95% CI 1.34 to 2.46, NNTB 9, 95% CI 6 to 15). In this analysis, in only 4 of the 12 trials, the diagnosis was made on clinical criteria only. We did not admit the trials of <LINK REF="STD-Kaiser-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Kaiser 2001</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Meltzer-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Meltzer 2005,</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Stalman-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Stalman 1997 </LINK>and <LINK REF="STD-Varonen-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Varonen 2003</LINK> in this analysis because they report only rates for cure or improvement, not for cure only. As in <LINK REF="REF-Rosenfeld-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rosenfeld 2007</LINK>, the forest plot reveals heterogeneity (I<SUP>2 </SUP>statistic 50%): the trials with inclusion based on technical investigations show more benefit for antibiotics than the ones with inclusion on a clinical basis. Besides this, taking cure or improvement as an outcome measure, <LINK REF="REF-Falagas-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Falagas 2008</LINK> found that patients with rhinosinusitis benefit from antibiotics (OR 1.64, 95% CI 1.35 to 2.00) NNTB 11 (95% CI 8 to 17). However, for the <LINK REF="STD-Meltzer-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Meltzer 2005</LINK> study, <LINK REF="REF-Falagas-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Falagas 2008</LINK> used the number of treatment failures as the number of patients that were cured, which makes the cure rate artificially high. The heterogeneity is low but the same trend (more technical investigations, more benefit of antibiotics) can be seen. <LINK REF="REF-Falagas-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Falagas 2008</LINK> put his positive result into perspective by comparing them to a NNTH (adverse events) of 12 (95% CI 8 to 21), a number that is, irrespective of the different kind of studies included in the analysis, comparable to our results. <LINK REF="REF-Falagas-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Falagas 2008</LINK> found no significant difference in cure or improvement for adults versus children, imaging versus clinical criteria for inclusion, assessment at 7 to 11 versus 14 to 15 days, nor year of publication.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2012-08-14 08:14:00 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Mieke L van Driel">
<P>Our meta-analysis shows that there could be a beneficial therapeutic effect of antibiotics in patients with clinically diagnosed acute rhinosinusitis, but this effect is small and only 5 more patients per 100 will cure faster if they receive antibiotics instead of placebo. The subgroup of patients with purulent discharge could benefit slightly more. However, the benefits need to be seen in the context of the risk of experiencing adverse effects, especially of a gastrointestinal nature. This meta-analysis was directed mainly at patients assessed in a primary care setting and excluded patients that were further investigated with laboratory or radiology tests. Considering the worldwide high antibiotic prescription rate for rhinosinusitis, growing antibiotic resistance and the very low incidence of complications, we can conclude that there is no place for antibiotics in the patient with clinically diagnosed but uncomplicated acute rhinosinusitis. Exceptions should be made for children, patients with a suppressed immune system and patients with severe disease (e.g. very high fever, prolonged symptoms, findings suggestive of severe sepsis such as hypotension) and patients referred to an ear, nose and throat specialist because of confirmed or perceived complications, as there is no evidence available from randomised, placebo controlled trials for these potentially more vulnerable subgroups. Complications are so rare (1/2450 participants) that only case reports can give information about their course, hence evidence that serious complications can be prevented by giving antibiotics early is lacking.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2012-08-09 16:05:07 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Despite availability of several studies and meta-analyses there is still insufficient data to enable subgroup analysis of patients who could rationally benefit more from antibiotics, e.g. patients with high fever, severe facial pain or rhinorrhoea. Further studies are needed to better predict the success of antibiotic treatment. It may be unlikely that such data will become available as they pose ethical (exposing vulnerable patients to placebo treatment) and feasibility (a relatively small group that would take a long to collect data) issues. Better recording of routinely collected data and morbidity, as well as adverse drug reaction registers might be helpful in answering this question.</P>

We could not calculate the ratio of patients with missing data to participants with events, because the primary outcome was not "cure" but a difference in symptom scores. Discontinuation of treatment: 49/499 (10.5%, 20 out of the amoxicillin group, 29 out of the placebo group) due to adverse events, treatment failure, lost to follow-up, wish to discontinue, noncompliance with the protocol.
