<P>Cognitive impairment is common after stroke and can affect a person's ability to do everyday activities such as dressing, feeding, and showering. Occupational therapy aims to help people reach their maximum level of functional independence. This review of one trial including 33 participants found that there is currently insufficient evidence to establish the effectiveness of occupational therapy for cognitive impairment in people who have had a stroke. More well-designed clinical trials which test occupational therapy interventions for cognitive impairment post-stroke are needed.</P>

<P>We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (last searched May 2009), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (<I>The Cochrane Library</I> Issue 1, 2009), MEDLINE (1966 to April 2009), EMBASE (1980 to April 2009), CINAHL (1982 to April 2009), PsycINFO (1840 to April 2009), PsycBITE, OTseeker and Dissertation Abstracts (the latest three were searched up to April 2009). In an effort to identify further published, unpublished, and ongoing trials, we also tracked relevant references through the cited reference search in Science Citation Index (SCI) and Social Science Citation Index (SSCI), reviewed the reference lists of relevant studies and reviews, handsearched relevant occupational therapy journals, and contacted key researchers in the area.</P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2010-06-01 10:26:28 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2010-06-01 10:20:04 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>Stroke is a leading cause of chronic disability in many developed countries in the world (<LINK REF="REF-CDCP-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">CDCP 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Thrift-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thrift 2000</LINK>). A frequent consequence of stroke is impairment of cognition (<LINK REF="REF-Patel-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Patel 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tatemichi-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tatemichi 1994</LINK>). Cognition encompasses processes that enable people to 'think', including the ability to concentrate, remember and learn, and may also include metaprocesses such as executive functioning (<LINK REF="REF-Unsworth-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Unsworth 1999</LINK>). There is some disagreement regarding the classification of specific cognitive domains and impairments. Some authors include visual-spatial perception and apraxia as cognitive impairments (<LINK REF="REF-Cicerone-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cicerone 2005</LINK>). However, many texts also classify visual-spatial perception and apraxia separately to cognitive impairments. For the purpose of this review cognition impairment is considered to encompass impairments in attention and concentration, memory, orientation, and/or executive functions in accordance with The National Stroke Foundation of Australia's Clinical Guidelines for Stroke Rehabilitation and Recovery (<LINK REF="REF-National-Stroke-Foundation-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">National Stroke Foundation 2005</LINK>). Patel et al found that, in the three-year period after the onset of their first stroke, up to 39% of patients had cognitive impairment (<LINK REF="REF-Patel-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Patel 2003</LINK>). A significant relationship has been found between cognitive abilities and functional performance (<LINK REF="REF-Abreu-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Abreu 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hanson-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hanson 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Poole-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Poole 1991</LINK>). Thus, cognitive impairment can reduce the independence of people who have had a stroke when performing basic activities of daily living (such as eating, dressing, and toileting) and instrumental activities of daily living (such as housework and social interactions) (<LINK REF="REF-Hochstenbach-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hochstenbach 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Patel-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Patel 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zinn-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zinn 2004</LINK>). As a result, people with cognitive impairment following stroke often require ongoing care and support, which can place a strain on caregivers and society (<LINK REF="REF-Blake-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blake 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Doyle-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Doyle 2002</LINK>). Therefore, it is important for researchers and clinicians to identify effective interventions to treat cognitive impairment following stroke.</P>
<P>Occupational therapy plays a unique and important role in a multidisciplinary approach to the treatment of cognitive impairment (<LINK REF="REF-Zoltan-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zoltan 2007</LINK>). Occupational therapists assess and treat cognitive deficits to assist patients to reach their maximum level of functional independence and fulfil desired and required life roles after stroke (<LINK REF="REF-Legg-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Legg 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Poole-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Poole 1991</LINK>). The two general techniques used by occupational therapists to treat cognitive impairment are remedial and compensatory approaches (<LINK REF="REF-Blundon-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blundon 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Poole-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Poole 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Radomski-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Radomski 1994</LINK>). Based on the concept of the plasticity of the human brain and its ability to reorganise after being damaged, the remedial approach aims to promote patients' function by retraining deficits in specific cognitive domains (e.g. attention, memory and organisation). This approach assumes that retrained skills will transfer to functional performance more broadly than the immediate task including such activities of daily living as managing finances or planning household tasks. The compensatory approach utilises patients' residual strengths to compensate for deficits and aims to restore their function by teaching and assisting them and their families to develop strategies to overcome performance deficits. Debate exists around the validity of the assumptions and the effectiveness of these approaches. It has been argued that the skills acquired through repetitive drill-like exercises using a remedial approach may not be readily transferred to daily living activities (<LINK REF="REF-Cobble-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cobble 1991</LINK>). Furthermore, direct training in specific functional activities as part of the compensatory approach may not necessarily generalise to improved performance in everyday activities in home, work or school, and in leisure contexts (<LINK REF="REF-Hanson-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hanson 1997</LINK>). A comprehensive systematic review may help to clarify these debates and examine the effectiveness of occupational therapy in treating cognitive impairment.</P>
<P>To our knowledge, there is no systematic review that has specifically examined the effectiveness of interventions delivered by occupational therapists in treating cognitive impairment in people with stroke. A review by Cicerone et al addressed the issue of the effectiveness of cognitive rehabilitation in stroke patients; however, it is not specific to occupational therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Cicerone-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cicerone 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cicerone-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cicerone 2005</LINK>). Two reviews have examined the effectiveness of occupational therapy with stroke patients in general, but did not focus on the treatment of cognitive impairment (<LINK REF="REF-Ma-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ma 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Steultjens-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Steultjens 2003</LINK>). As occupational therapy is considered to be an important part of the multidisciplinary management of stroke, and treatment of cognitive impairment is a common focus of this intervention, it is important to review the effectiveness of occupational therapy in assisting people with cognitive impairment after stroke to improve their functional independence.</P>

<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS MODIFIED="2010-04-09 14:19:11 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>We included trials if their participants were adults (aged 18 years or over) with a clinically defined stroke and confirmed cognitive impairment as specified in each trial. For the purpose of this review we focused on cognitive impairments including attention and concentration, memory, orientation, and/or executive functions. We excluded trials with mixed aetiology groups unless participants who had had (and only had) a stroke comprised more than 50% of the participants in the trial and separate data for the participants with stroke were available either in the published article or from the trial authors.</P>
</CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS MODIFIED="2010-06-01 10:20:23 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>We included all occupational therapy interventions for cognitive impairment in people with stroke. We defined occupational therapy interventions in this review as interventions carried out by an occupational therapist or under the supervision of an occupational therapist, or indexed in major international occupational therapy texts (<LINK REF="REF-Katz-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Katz 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pedretti-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pedretti 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Trombly-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Trombly 2002</LINK>). These interventions may take either a remedial or a compensatory approach, or both. The remedial approach focuses on training specific cognitive deficits using media such as pencil and paper, computer tasks and board games. In a compensatory approach interventions may include (1) training skills for daily activities (e.g. dressing, ambulation, driving, managing a meal) and vocation using compensatory strategies; (2) advising and educating about the use of assistive devices that aid cognitive function, such as an alarm watch, a hand-held computer, or a medication container; and (3) educating patients, families, and caregivers about strategies to overcome patients' cognitive impairment. The dynamic interactional approach (previously referred to as multicontextual) is an integrated approach, encompassing both remedial and compensatory elements to encourage generalisation of the treatment effect achieved in a clinical setting to patients' real life performance situation (<LINK REF="REF-Toglia-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Toglia 2005</LINK>). We considered the dynamic interactional approach as a third type of intervention in this review, separate from remedial and compensatory approaches. For the purpose of this review we focused on cognitive impairments including attention and concentration, memory, orientation, and/or executive functions. We did not include studies that focused on apraxia or perceptual impairments without also containing elements of cognitive retraining.  We also did not include trials which examined the effects of change to pharmaceutical interventions on cognitive function following stroke.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Study selection</HEADING>
<P>One review author (CK) screened the titles of articles identified in the searches and references, eliminated irrelevant studies and obtained the abstracts of the remaining studies. Using these abstracts, two review authors (CK and TH or SB) independently completed the first phase of study selection according to the four eligibility criteria (types of studies, participants, interventions, and outcome measures). We obtained the full texts of the studies that were considered as eligible for inclusion from this process or for which eligibility was unclear. Two review authors (CK and TH or SB) independently completed the second study selection process to finally decide on each trial&#8217;s inclusion or exclusion. We resolved any disagreements by discussion based on the inclusion criteria. If we could not reach a consensus, the third review author made the decision. When it was unclear whether the intervention was delivered by an occupational therapist we contacted the study authors for clarification.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Assessment of methodological quality</HEADING>
<P>Two review authors (TH and SB) independently evaluated the methodological quality of eligible trials. During this evaluation, the review authors were blinded to the source of publication and results. The four sources of potential bias in trials of intervention effectiveness that we evaluated were: selection bias, performance bias, detection bias and attrition bias. According to the definition by Juni et al (<LINK REF="REF-Juni-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Juni 2001</LINK>) selection bias refers to biased allocation of participants to comparison groups (i.e. absence of, or inadequate, allocation concealment). We assessed the methods of allocation concealment of the eligible studies according to the three categories and criteria suggested in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions </I>(<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2008</LINK>): A - adequate; B - unclear; and C - inadequate. Performance bias refers to unequal provision of care apart from the intervention under evaluation (i.e. lack of blinding of therapists or participants, or both) (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2008</LINK>). Detection bias refers to biased assessment of outcome (i.e. lack of blinding of outcome assessors) (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2008</LINK>). Attrition bias refers to biased occurrence and handling of deviations from the intervention protocol (i.e. lack of analysis according to intention-to-treat) and loss to follow-up (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2008</LINK>). To evaluate the four types of bias in the eligible trials, we applied the eight internal validity items adapted from the PEDro scale in this review (<LINK REF="REF-Moseley-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moseley 2002</LINK>). After reviewing the trials, we assigned each of the eight items a 'yes' (present) or 'no' (absent or not reported) to indicate the methodological quality of the studies according to the criteria used to rate articles in the OTseeker database (<A HREF="http://www.otseeker.com/scale.htm">http://www.otseeker.com/scale.htm</A>) (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>

<OL>
<LI>Sample characteristics such as: age, level of education, sex, first or recurrent stroke, type and severity of stroke, time since onset of stroke, type of cognitive impairment, sample size, number of drop outs.</LI>

<LI>Outcome measures: the outcome measures used in the trial and when they were administered.</LI>
</OL>
<P>The same two review authors independently extracted data using a data extraction form to record methodological and outcome data.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Data analysis</HEADING>
<P>For continuous data, we planned to calculate two types of estimate. The measure of the treatment difference for any outcome would be the mean difference (MD) when the pooled trials use the same rating scale or test, and the standardised mean difference (SMD) (the absolute mean difference divided by the standard deviation) when they use different rating scales or tests. We planned to calculate each one, together with the corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI). For dichotomous data, we planned to compute the relative risk (RR) or odds ratio (OR) with 95% CI.</P>
<P>We planned to pool the results of trials to present the overall estimate of the treatment effect using a fixed-effect model viewed to assess heterogeneity. We planned to test heterogeneity between trial results by using I<SUP>2</SUP> estimates (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2003</LINK>). We would consider an I<SUP>2</SUP> value above 50% substantial, indicating heterogeneity between trial results. If heterogeneity was present we would carry out a sensitivity analysis to explore the reasons for this. Otherwise, we would use a random-effects model (in which case the confidence intervals will be broader than those of a fixed-effect model).</P>
<P>We planned to carry out a sensitivity analysis to evaluate the effect of trial quality by analysing separately the following categories of studies:</P>
<OL>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Results of the search</HEADING>
<P>We conducted the most current search of electronic databases in May 2009. This search yielded a total of 1639 references. We identified only one trial that met the inclusion criteria. We identified an additional trial that met the criteria but it is an ongoing trial that was due for completion at the end of 2009.<BR/>
</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Included studies</HEADING>
<P>The included study (<LINK REF="STD-Carter--1983" TYPE="STUDY">Carter 1983</LINK>) is a RCT that examined the effect of a cognitive skills remediation programme with 33 people who were receiving rehabilitation in a hospital following acute stroke. For the 16 participants in the intervention group, cognitive skills remediation training was administered on an individual basis for 30 to 40 minutes three times per week for an average of three to four weeks. The cognitive skills remediation training was based on the <I>Thinking Skills Workbook</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Carter-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carter 1980</LINK>). The comparison group of 17 participants received rehabilitation as usual. The primary outcome measures were tests of visual scanning, visual-spatial matching and time judgement from the <I>Thinking Skills Workbook</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Carter-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carter 1980</LINK>). However, in this review we considered only the time judgement scores a measure of cognitive skill as this review classified visual scanning and visual-spatial matching as perceptual skills. We extracted data about the functional outcomes from the Carter study from the second article published in 1988 (<LINK REF="STD-Carter--1983" TYPE="STUDY">Carter 1983</LINK>), which reported participants' basic ADL scores on the Barthel Index. This study met the criteria for inclusion because it measured the effect of elements of cognitive training on basic activities of daily living and on specific cognitive skills (time judgement).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Excluded studies</HEADING>
<P>We excluded trials from this review if the intervention did not address cognitive impairments of people following stroke; if the trials were not RCTs; if they were conducted with mixed aetiology groups and participants with stroke were fewer than 50% of the participants or data were not separately available for participants with stroke; or the intervention in the trial was not carried out or supervised by an occupational therapist. We also excluded studies if the focus was on interventions for perceptual impairments or apraxia without also including interventions for cognitive impairments. Studies listed in the <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_EXCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of excluded studies</LINK> table are those that appeared to be relevant and focused on cognitive retraining, but to our knowledge were not carried out by occupational therapists or did not focus on cognitive retraining.<BR/>

<STUDY_QUALITY MODIFIED="2010-06-01 10:21:08 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>Two authors rated the methodological quality of the study independently using the PEDro scale (<LINK REF="REF-Maher-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maher 2003</LINK>). Individual item scores can be found in <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Sequence generation</HEADING>
<P>The participants in the <LINK REF="STD-Carter--1983" TYPE="STUDY">Carter 1983</LINK> study were randomly allocated to groups but it is unclear how this was carried out.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Allocation</HEADING>
<P>There was no mention within the <LINK REF="STD-Carter--1983" TYPE="STUDY">Carter 1983</LINK> articles of allocation to group being concealed.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Blinding</HEADING>
<P>Blinding of participants and therapists was not reported and is unlikely to have been achievable. A blind testing procedure was attempted, but according to the authors it was possible for the outcome assessor to be aware of the group assignment of the participants because of the physical layout of the stroke unit.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Follow-up and exclusions</HEADING>
<P>Reported outcome data for the study were available for 85% of participants for the Barthel Index outcome. The authors state that Barthel scores were not available for three participants from the control group and two participants in the treatment group but no reason for this was provided. Although data were available for 33 participants for the cognitive tests the authors only calculated cognitive test scores for the 76% of participants who had pre-test performance below 80%; that is, scores for participants who had 80% of better pre-test scores were not included in the calculation. The authors state this was to prevent possible ceiling effects.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Selective reporting</HEADING>
<P>It is unclear whether selective reporting occurred in the <LINK REF="STD-Carter--1983" TYPE="STUDY">Carter 1983</LINK> study. The description of the method used stated that three aspects of cognition were measured and these were each reported on. However, the cognitive skills evaluation from the <I>Thinking Skills Workbook</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Carter-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carter 1980</LINK>) from which the tests were drawn for the <LINK REF="STD-Carter--1983" TYPE="STUDY">Carter 1983</LINK> study included eight cognitive skills.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Other potential sources of bias</HEADING>
<P>The <LINK REF="STD-Carter--1983" TYPE="STUDY">Carter 1983</LINK> paper did not report use of intention-to-treat analysis.<BR/>

<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS MODIFIED="2010-04-09 14:42:00 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>Given that there was only one study included in this review, a meta-analysis was not possible. We found no difference between groups for the two relevant outcomes that were measured: improvement in time judgement skills and improvement in basic ADLs on the Barthel Index.<BR/>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2010-05-17 10:42:54 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>The aim of this review was to identify and evaluate the effectiveness of occupational therapy for cognitive impairment following stroke. Only one trial met the criteria for inclusion: the <LINK REF="STD-Carter--1983" TYPE="STUDY">Carter 1983</LINK> trial, therefore data could not be pooled for further analysis or interpretation. This study tested the effect of cognitive remediation skills training compared with usual rehabilitation for people with cognitive impairments following stroke. We found no differences between groups for the cognitive skill of time judgement (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>) or for basic ADL measured using the Barthel Index (<LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>). It is possible that the sample size of only 33 participants may not have been large enough to detect an effect if one existed. Therefore, this study provides insufficient evidence about the effectiveness or otherwise for this intervention.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2010-05-17 11:04:10 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2010-05-17 11:04:10 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>The effectiveness of occupational therapy for cognitive impairment post-stroke remains unclear. The potential benefits of cognitive retraining delivered as part of an occupational therapy service on improving basic daily activity function or specific cognitive abilities, or both, of people who have had a stroke cannot be supported or refuted by evidence from the reviewed RCT.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2010-05-17 10:44:04 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>In order to obtain reliable and valid evidence of the effect of occupational therapy for cognitive impairment post-stroke further methodologically rigorous investigations using RCTs are needed. The included study must be viewed in the light of its small sample size. Future studies should aim to have larger numbers of participants.</P>
