<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2016-08-18 18:45:22 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Sarah Dawson">
<P>This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2012.</P>
<P>
<B>Why is this review important?</B>
</P>
<P>Depression is a common problem among older people and causes considerable disability. Even after successful treatment, it frequently recurs.</P>
<P>The causes of depression in older people are more diverse than in younger adults and, as the number of older people is steadily increasing, it is important to study the effects of treatments specifically in older adults. Treatments commonly used are antidepressant drugs and psychological treatments (talking treatments).</P>
<P>
<B>Who will be interested in this review?</B>
</P>
<P>- People with depression, friends, families, and carers.</P>
<P>- General practitioners, psychiatrists, clinical psychologists, psychological therapists, and pharmacists.</P>
<P>- Professionals working in older-adult mental health services.</P>
<P>- Professionals working in Improving Access to Psychological Therapies services in the UK.</P>
<P>
<B>What questions does this review aim to answer?</B>
</P>
<P>In people aged 60 years and over who have recovered from depression while taking antidepressant medication:</P>
<P>- Is receiving continued antidepressant medicine, psychological treatment, or a combination of the two more effective in preventing recurrence of depression than receiving placebo (a pretend treatment) or any of the other treatments?</P>
<P>- Is receiving continued antidepressant medicine, psychological treatment, or a combination of the two more harmful than receiving placebo or any of the other treatments?</P>
<P>
<B>Which studies does the review include?</B>
</P>
<P>We searched medical databases to find all relevant studies completed up to 13 July 2015. The studies had to compare antidepressant treatment, psychological treatment, or a combination of the two, with placebo or the other treatments for preventing recurrence of depression in people aged 60 years and over. We included seven studies, involving 803 people.</P>
<P>Six studies compared antidepressant medicine with placebo. Only two of the studies involved psychological treatments. The studies varied in how they were conducted, numbers of participants, and types of participants.</P>
<P>
<B>What does the evidence from the review tell us?</B>
</P>
<P>Remaining on antidepressant medicines for one year appears to reduce the risk of depression returning from 61% to 42% but the benefits at other time intervals could not be determined. Antidepressant treatment appeared to be no more harmful than placebo as measured by number of participants dropping out of trials. The benefits of psychological therapies were not clear, due to the small number of studies. The quality of evidence was low.</P>
<P>The majority of participants in the studies were women. Few were over 75 years of age. Most had received treatment for their original depressive illness as outpatients, indicating less severe depression.</P>
<P>Antidepressant medicines used were both older type antidepressants (called tricyclics) and newer type (called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors). Psychological treatments were interpersonal therapy, which addresses obstacles in relationships, and cognitive behavioural therapy, which addresses inactivity and self-defeating thought patterns.</P>
<P>
<B>What should happen next?</B>
</P>
<P>This review provides limited evidence that continuing antidepressant medication for one year can reduce the risk of depression recurring with no additional harm. However, it cannot be used to make firm recommendations due to the limited number and small size of studies involved. Limitations in the design and reporting of these studies may also make the results unrepresentative. Similarly, no firm conclusions can be drawn about psychological treatments or combinations of antidepressant and psychological treatments in preventing recurrence.</P>
<P>Further, larger, trials are required to clarify any benefits of antidepressant and psychological treatments. These trials should include more people aged over 75, and people with other problems typical of people treated in routine clinical services, such long-term physical illness and mild memory problems.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2016-08-08 22:35:29 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson">
<P>Depressive illness is common in old age. Prevalence in the community of case level depression is around 15% and milder forms of depression are more common. It causes significant distress and disability. The number of people over the age of 60 years is expected to double by 2050 and so interventions for this often long-term and recurrent condition are increasingly important. The causes of late-life depression differ from depression in younger adults and so it is appropriate to study it separately.</P>

</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2016-08-18 18:26:22 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Sarah Dawson">
<P>We performed a search of the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Group's specialised register (the CCMDCTR) to 13 July 2015. The CCMDCTR includes relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs) from the following bibliographic databases: <I>The Cochrane Library</I> (all years), MEDLINE (1950 to date), EMBASE (1974 to date), and PsycINFO (1967 to date). We also conducted a cited reference search on 13 July 2015 of the Web of Science for citations of primary reports of included studies.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2016-08-08 19:59:58 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson">
<P>Both review authors independently selected studies. We included RCTs involving people aged 60 years and over successfully treated for an episode of depression and randomised to receive continuation and maintenance treatment with antidepressants, psychological therapies, or a combination.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2016-08-08 09:39:50 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson">
<P>Two review authors independently extracted data. The primary outcome for benefit was recurrence rate of depression (reaching a cut-off on any depression rating scale) at 12 months and the primary outcome for harm was drop-outs at 12 months. Secondary outcomes included relapse/recurrence rates at other time points, global impression of change, social functioning, and deaths. We performed meta-analysis using risk ratio (RR) for dichotomous outcomes and mean difference (MD) for continuous outcomes, with 95% confidence intervals (CI).</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-08-18 10:45:47 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson">
<P>This update identified no further trials. Seven studies from the previous review met the inclusion criteria (803 participants). Six compared antidepressant medication with placebo; two involved psychological therapies. There was marked heterogeneity between the studies.</P>
<P>Comparing antidepressants with placebo on the primary outcome for benefit, there was a statistically significant difference favouring antidepressants in reducing recurrence compared with placebo at 12 months with a GRADE rating of low for quality of evidence (three RCTs, n = 247, RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.82; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 5). Comparing antidepressants with placebo on the primary outcome for harms, there was no difference in drop-out rates at 12 months' follow-up, with a GRADE rating of low.</P>
<P>There was no significant difference between psychological treatment and antidepressant in recurrence rates at 12 months (one RCT, n = 53) or between combination treatment and antidepressant alone at 12 months.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2016-08-08 09:43:04 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson">
<P>This updated Cochrane review supports the findings of the original 2012 review. The long-term benefits and harm of continuing antidepressant medication in the prevention of recurrence of depression in older people are not clear and no firm treatment recommendations can be made on the basis of this review. Continuing antidepressant medication for 12 months appears to be helpful with no increased harms; however, this was based on only three small studies, relatively few participants, use of a range of antidepressant classes, and clinically heterogeneous populations. Comparisons at other time points did not reach statistical significance.</P>
<P>Data on psychological therapies and combined treatments were too limited to draw any conclusions on benefits and harms.</P>
<P>The quality of the evidence used in reaching these conclusions was low and the review does not, therefore, offer clear guidance to clinicians and patients on best practice and matching interventions to particular patient characteristics.</P>
<P>Of note, we identified no new studies that evaluated pharmacological or psychological interventions in the continuation and maintenance treatment of depression in older people. We are aware of studies conducted since the previous review that included both older people and adults under the age of 65 years, but these fall outside of the remit of this review. We believe that there remains a need for studies solely recruiting older people, particularly the 'older old' with comorbid medical problems. However, these studies are likely to be challenging to conduct and may not, so far, have been prioritised by funders.</P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2016-08-22 09:32:48 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2016-08-08 21:14:13 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2016-08-08 10:00:02 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson">
<P>Depression is among the most common of psychiatric disorders. It remains common in old age, occurring more frequently than dementia. Several community studies have shown a prevalence in the population over 64 years of age of around 15% of case level depression (i.e. that which a psychiatrist would consider in need of treatment) (<LINK REF="REF-Evans-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Evans 2003</LINK>). Milder forms of depression are likely to be more common and still account for significant suffering. Very old people are particularly prone to developing depression (<LINK REF="REF-Blazer-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blazer 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>Depression is important because it causes significant distress and is associated with a great deal of disability in older people. Chronic depression is associated with over five times the odds of worsening disability over three years (<LINK REF="REF-Lenze-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lenze 2005</LINK>). The number of people over the age of 60 years is expected to double by 2050 and so interventions for long-term and recurrent conditions such as depression will become more important in maintaining healthy functioning (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2015</LINK>).</P>
<P>The causes of late-life depression, especially in cases with onset after 50 years of age, are thought to differ from depression in younger adults. They include neuropsychological abnormalities such as executive dysfunction (<LINK REF="REF-Gansler-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gansler 2015</LINK>), and physical illnesses such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and stroke (<LINK REF="REF-Valkonova-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Valkonova 2013</LINK>). This makes it appropriate to study late-life depression separately from depression in younger adults. It also means that it would be useful to establish if there is a difference in treatment response between late-onset and early-onset illness.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2016-08-08 21:14:13 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson">
<P>A range of antidepressant medications are used to treat older people. They include older agents such as tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) and monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), as well as newer agents such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin-noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), noradrenergic and specific serotonergic antidepressants (NASSAs), and reversible inhibitors of monoamine oxidase A (RIMAs) (<LINK REF="REF-Abou_x002d_Saleh-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Abou-Saleh 2010</LINK>). TCAs include imipramine and amitriptyline; SSRIs include sertraline and citalopram; SNRIs include venlafaxine; NASSAs include mirtazapine; and RIMAs include moclobemide.</P>
<P>Several short-term psychological therapies are used to treat older people with depression, including behavioural therapy, cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), interpersonal therapy (IPT), and psychodynamic therapy. Behavioural therapy uses an operant conditioning model to reintroduce positive reinforcement, to reduce the time spent on negative events, and to overcome avoidance through behavioural activation. CBT begins with behavioural activation but also tackles the thought patterns that maintain inactivity and depressed mood by using direct verbal challenging and behavioural experiments. Problem-solving therapy teaches a structured approach to tackling inactivity, lack of pleasurable activities, and dealing with psychosocial problems. Interpersonal psychotherapy focuses on the interplay between depression and interpersonal relationships. It uses patient education and a number of strategies such as role play and communication analysis to tackle obstacles in relationships (<LINK REF="REF-Wilkinson-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wilkinson 2010</LINK>). Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy combines teaching on the role of thought patterns in depression with training in meditation techniques (<LINK REF="REF-Segal-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Segal 2002</LINK>). Psychodynamic psychotherapy focusses on the person's life review, losses experienced, attitudes to ageing, and the relationship with the therapist (<LINK REF="REF-Garner-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Garner 2008</LINK>). Counselling, such as Rogerian person-centred therapy, is an unstructured psychological therapy with an emphasis on warmth, genuineness, and empathy in the therapeutic relationship (<LINK REF="REF-Zarit-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zarit 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>There is a small number of trials that support the efficacy of psychological therapies as acute phase interventions with older people, but fewer than with younger people (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2010</LINK>). One Cochrane review found cognitive behavioural interventions to be superior to waiting list control in five trials, but the authors suggested caution in generalising this finding to clinical populations due to the small number of participants (<LINK REF="REF-Wilson-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wilson 2008</LINK>). A more recent trial with 204 participants in primary care showed benefits of combining CBT with treatment as usual (including antidepressants) as compared with treatment as usual and treatment as usual plus a talking control (<LINK REF="REF-Serfaty-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Serfaty 2009</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2016-08-08 10:08:59 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson">
<P>Older adults with depression are frequently prescribed antidepressants (<LINK REF="REF-Percudani-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Percudani 2005</LINK>), and the short-term response to treatment is generally good (<LINK REF="REF-Katona-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Katona 2002</LINK>). Antidepressant action is thought to result from regulation of the monoamine neurotransmitter changes that occur in depressive illness. The rationale for continuing antidepressant treatment after clinical recovery, therefore, is that it will sustain regulation of monoamine activity.</P>
<P>Individual CBT is as effective as antidepressants in reducing symptoms of depression and produces more enduring benefit than antidepressant treatment; it also appears to be better tolerated than antidepressants. Adding CBT to antidepressant treatment can also improve outcome in more severe depression and possibly in chronic depression (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2010</LINK>). People with residual symptoms of depression after treatment have a poorer prognosis and psychological therapies may have an important role in reducing relapse and recurrence rates in these people (<LINK REF="REF-Paykel-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Paykel 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>Interpersonal psychotherapy can be used as a short-term acute phase treatment of depression (usually up to 16 sessions) or as a maintenance treatment with sessions more widely spaced over a period of months. The use of maintenance treatment allows for a greater number of therapeutic foci to be addressed including the long-standing patterns of interpersonal behaviour that may contribute to recurrence (so-called interpersonal deficits) (<LINK REF="REF-Miller-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Miller 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>Maintenance CBT involves helping the person to continue to identify and address the behavioural and cognitive patterns associated with depressive relapse (<LINK REF="STD-Wilkinson-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Wilkinson 2009</LINK>). CBT can continue to have a positive effect after it is discontinued (<LINK REF="REF-Blackburn-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blackburn 1997</LINK>), and, in younger adults, combining antidepressant medication and psychological therapies in the continuation phase produces better long-term results than antidepressants alone (<LINK REF="REF-Paykel-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Paykel 2005</LINK>). Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy is an intervention partly derived from CBT that is used in the maintenance treatment of depression. It combines teaching in the cognitive model of depression with meditation-based exercises (<LINK REF="REF-Segal-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Segal 2002</LINK>) to help the individual to recognise when their mood is beginning to become low, and to develop the capacity to allow distressing mood, thoughts, and sensations to come and go without engaging with them.</P>
<P>Psychodynamic therapy for depression is based on a model of vulnerability arising from early life experiences and disrupted childhood attachment. The relationship with the therapist is of key importance in identifying and fostering insight into psychological defence mechanisms. Psychodynamic therapy with the older person may help to develop a long-term sense of contentment and acceptance of the losses and changes associated with ageing (<LINK REF="REF-Garner-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Garner 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>As antidepressants and psychological therapies have different modes of action, combining them may produce greater benefits than either treatment alone. Psychological therapy may also include education on the benefits of antidepressant medication in order to foster treatment concordance.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2016-08-08 20:00:20 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson">
<P>This review adds to a programme of Cochrane reviews addressing the acute management of depression in older people with psychological therapies (<LINK REF="REF-Wilson-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wilson 2008</LINK>) and antidepressants (<LINK REF="REF-Mottram-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mottram 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>The long-term prognosis of late-life depression is known to be poor, with around a quarter of people becoming depressed within two years of remission or recovery and a third experiencing one or more relapses after two years (<LINK REF="REF-Cole-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cole 1997</LINK>). Therefore, it is important to identify treatments that will improve longer-term outcome (i.e. reduce rates of recurrence and relapse). In younger adults, continuing antidepressant medication after remission reduces the odds of relapse by 70% with effects lasting up to 36 months, as long as medication is continued (<LINK REF="REF-Geddes-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Geddes 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>Most previous reviews of trials with older adults have been narrative reviews and have focused on the acute treatment of depression (<LINK REF="REF-Are_x00e1_n-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Areán 2007</LINK>). None have included both antidepressant medication and psychological therapies. This review includes trials of antidepressant medication, psychological therapies, and combinations of the two in the continuation and maintenance phase treatment of depression in adults aged 60 years and over.</P>
<P>We anticipated that there would be few randomised controlled trials (RCTs) involving people aged 60 years and over. As many of these would be with small numbers of participants, a comprehensive review and meta-analysis was required. It was also likely that there would be high withdrawal rates through physical illness, adverse effects, and death and it was possible that drop-out rates would differ significantly between antidepressant treatment and psychological therapies. This review will help to identify the need for further studies.</P>

<P>The Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Group maintains a specialised register of randomized controlled trials, the CCMDCTR. This register contains over 40,000 reference records (reports of RCTs) for anxiety disorders, depression, bipolar disorder, eating disorders, self-harm and other mental disorders within the scope of this Group. The CCMDCTR is a partially studies based register with &gt;50% of reference records tagged to c12,500 individually PICO coded study records. Reports of trials for inclusion in the register are collated from (weekly) generic searches of Medline (1950-), Embase (1974-) and PsycINFO (1967-), quarterly searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) and review specific searches of additional databases. Reports of trials are also sourced from international trial registries, drug companies, the hand-searching of key journals, conference proceedings and other (non-Cochrane) systematic reviews and meta-analyses.

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2016-08-08 10:42:47 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson">
<P>We assessed trial quality using the Cochrane tool for assessing risk of bias. This tool assesses the following domains: sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding, handling of incomplete data, selective reporting, and other sources of bias. Both review authors independently assessed each paper before agreeing on 'Risk of bias' assessments in each domain. We contacted investigators for additional information in cases of incomplete recording.</P>
<P>We noted methods used for sequence generation and allocation concealment. We recorded methods for blinding participants, therapists, and assessors from treatment type along with evidence of effectiveness. In assessing incomplete outcome data, we assessed each main outcome at each time point for completeness including exclusions and attrition; we assessed methods for addressing incomplete data. To assess selective reporting, we compared stated outcomes with intended outcomes as stated in the methods sections and any available trial protocols.</P>
<P>We made judgements for each domain as high risk of bias, low risk of bias, or unclear risk of bias.</P>
</QUALITY_ASSESSMENT>
<EFFECT_MEASURES MODIFIED="2016-08-08 19:12:34 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson">
<P>We calculated risk ratios (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI). When the overall results were significant, we calculated the number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) and additional harmful outcome (NNTH), as the inverse of the risk difference (RD).</P>
<P>We presented mean differences (MD) for continuous data. Where necessary, we calculated standard deviations (SDs) from the study authors' CIs for MDs (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>).</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Cluster-randomised trials</HEADING>
<P>In cluster-randomised trials, participants in the same treatment group cannot be regarded as independent and an analysis that ignores clustering is likely to underestimate the standard error (SE) of the estimate. If study authors had taken account of clustering and reported data adjusted for possible within-group correlation, we used the adjusted data in this review. If they did not report adjusted data, we contacted authors to obtain intra-class correlation coefficients.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Studies with multiple treatment groups</HEADING>

</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Cross-over trials</HEADING>
<P>Cross-over trails evaluate the effect of experimental intervention compared with control intervention separately for each participant. Cross-over design is unlikely in continuation and maintenance trials in depression, especially trials of psychological therapies that have carry-over effects. As this review uses a point-in-time analysis comparing interventions at six monthly intervals from randomisation, data from cross-over trials could not be included.</P>

Excluding these two trials from the analysis resulted in a significant benefit of antidepressant treatment in the one remaining trial (<LINK REF="STD-Gorwood-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Gorwood 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>There was no significant reduction in recurrence rates at 18 months in people taking antidepressants compared with people taking placebo in the one trial yielding data (one RCT, n = 69; <LINK REF="FIG-04" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 4</LINK>).</P>
<P>There was no significant reduction in recurrence rates at 24 months in people taking antidepressants compared with people taking placebo (four RCTs, n = 282; <LINK REF="FIG-04" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 4</LINK>). There was a moderate degree of heterogeneity between the four trials in this analysis (I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 37%), with one trial being an outlier (<LINK REF="STD-Alexopoulos-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Alexopoulos 2000</LINK>). When we removed this trial from the analysis, the heterogeneity was reduced (I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 0%) but the result remained insignificant.</P>
<P>In the three trials of TCAs, antidepressant treatment was superior to placebo at 24 months.</P>
<P>There was a significant difference favouring the antidepressant group in reducing recurrence at 36 months compared with placebo in the one trial reporting data at 36 months (n = 57, RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.90; <LINK REF="STD-Reynolds-1999a" TYPE="STUDY">Reynolds 1999a</LINK>) (<LINK REF="FIG-04" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 4</LINK>).

<P>In the original review, we performed two a priori sensitivity analyses of recurrence rates in studies comparing antidepressant with placebo, on the basis of risk of bias in studies.

In the second sensitivity analysis, we omitted the one study with inadequate blinding of assessors (<LINK REF="STD-Wilkinson-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Wilkinson 2009</LINK>), which produced no change in significant findings.</P>
<P>We performed three additional sensitivity analyses in the original review. In the first, we removed <LINK REF="STD-Alexopoulos-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Alexopoulos 2000</LINK> (as an outlier) from the analysis of recurrence rates in studies comparing antidepressant with placebo; this did not affect the overall findings. In the second, we removed <LINK REF="STD-Reynolds-1999a" TYPE="STUDY">Reynolds 1999a</LINK> from the analysis (on the basis of younger age of participants); this did not affect the overall findings. In the third, we removed <LINK REF="STD-Klysner-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Klysner 2002</LINK> from the analysis of recurrence rates as the only study with a drop-out rate of over 20%; this did not affect the overall findings.</P>
<P>In this update, we performed further sensitivity analyses in response to feedback on the original review (received 20 April 2015). These analyses were to assess the effect of excluding drop-outs from recurrence rates in <LINK REF="STD-Reynolds-1999a" TYPE="STUDY">Reynolds 1999a</LINK>. The study authors used censoring of drop-outs for their survival analysis whereas this review used the more conservative intention-to-treat for point-in-time analysis. We assumed that all drop-outs had occurred during year one of follow-up as the study authors were unable to provide exact timings of the drop-outs. The sensitivity analyses produced no changes in significant findings except in comparison six (antidepressants/psychological therapies combination versus psychological therapies alone) where the combination of antidepressant and psychological therapy became superior to psychological therapy alone at 12 months, in the one study making this comparison.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-08-08 21:15:46 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson">
<P>This updated review was based on data from seven studies from which six comparisons were possible, involving 803 participants. Six of the studies compared continuation/maintenance antidepressant treatment with placebo. Only two studies involved psychological therapies. Both of these examined the effect of psychological therapies in combination with antidepressant medication compared with medication alone and one also compared the combination with both psychological therapies alone and placebo alone. Follow-up intervals varied between the studies from six to 36 months.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Antidepressants versus placebo</HEADING>
<P>Results for the primary outcomes are shown in <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>.</P>
<P>Six trials involving 708 participants compared continuation/maintenance antidepressant treatment with placebo, three trials using TCAs and three using SSRIs. Continuation/maintenance antidepressant medication reduced risk of recurrence after 12 months with an NNTB of 5. There was marked clinical heterogeneity in the studies and significant numbers of drop-outs, but the direction of the effect was in favour of antidepressants in all trials. There was no statistically significant risk reduction for recurrence at 24 months when the analysis included all six studies. However, when data from the three trials of TCAs were analysed separately, there was a statistically significant reduction in recurrence risk with an NNTB of 5. It might be assumed that drop-outs due to adverse effects would be greater with TCAs. However, there were no data that addressed this question as the only trials reporting drop-outs due to adverse effects separately were the trials of SSRIs.</P>
<P>In the one trial in which participants were followed up for 36 months, maintenance antidepressant medication reduced risk of recurrence after with an NNTB of 5 (<LINK REF="STD-Reynolds-1999a" TYPE="STUDY">Reynolds 1999a</LINK>). Participants in this trial were relatively young and cognitively unimpaired compared to participants in other trials. In this trial, in addition to outcome assessments, participants receiving placebo also attended medication clinics for physical assessment. For the purpose of this review, we considered this a placebo condition comparable to other studies in this comparison, but the medication clinic contact could be considered as an active treatment component.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Antidepressants versus psychological therapies</HEADING>
<P>Only one trial, involving 53 participants, compared an antidepressant (nortriptyline) with a psychological therapy (IPT). There was no significant difference in terms of recurrence of depression. Therefore, the available data were too limited to allow for any clear conclusion on the comparative efficacy of antidepressants and psychological therapies. There were no deaths among participants.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Antidepressant/psychological therapies combination versus antidepressant</HEADING>
<P>Two trials involving 98 participants compared a combination of continuation/maintenance antidepressant and psychological therapies with antidepressant alone. There was low heterogeneity between the two studies, despite their using different psychological treatments (group CBT and IPT). There was no significant difference in terms of recurrence of depression and no separate data on drop-outs due to adverse effects. Only one trial reported drop-outs due to deaths, with no difference between combination of continuation/maintenance antidepressant and psychological therapies and control. The available data were too limited to allow for any clear conclusions on comparative efficacy.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Psychological therapies versus drug placebo</HEADING>
<P>Only one trial compared IPT with drug placebo, in 54 participants. Overall, there was no significant difference in recurrence. There were no deaths recorded in either arm. They did not report drop-outs due to adverse effects.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Antidepressant/psychological therapies combination versus psychological therapies alone</HEADING>
<P>Only one trial compared antidepressant/psychological therapies combination with psychological therapies alone (IPT) in 50 participants. There was a significant superiority of combination over psychological therapy alone at 24 and 36 months of follow-up, but no significant difference at 12 months' follow-up. They reported no deaths. They did not report drop-outs due to adverse effects. Although this suggests that at two and three years the combination is more efficacious, it is possible that the finding in this one study has arisen by chance.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Antidepressant/psychological therapies combination versus drug placebo</HEADING>
<P>Only one trial compared antidepressant/psychological therapies combination with drug placebo in 54 participants. Overall, combination treatment was significantly superior to placebo at 12, 24, and 36 months' follow-up with an NNTB of 2 at 12 months and 3 at 36 months. They reported no deaths and did not record drop-outs due to adverse effects.</P>

<P>We identified only a small number of trials of antidepressant medication including two TCA drugs (nortriptyline and dothiepin) and three SSRIs (escitalopram, citalopram, and sertraline). Thus, evidence is lacking on other classes of antidepressant drug such as SNRIs, MAOIs, and mirtazapine (a NASSA), and other types of TCAs.</P>
<P>We included only two trials involving psychological therapies so clearly further evaluation of psychological therapies is required, including IPT, CBT, and other psychological therapies such as psychodynamic, behavioural, and mindfulness-based cognitive therapy.</P>
<P>The follow-up periods of the included trials varied. Only one trial followed up participants for as long as 36 months.</P>
<P>Data on tolerability of treatments were lacking as most studies did not record drop-out specifically due to adverse effects and deaths.</P>
<P>For this review, the outcome used as a measure of efficacy was recurrence rates at six-month intervals, that is, the raw number of new episodes detected at these intervals. However, in practice, the effect of treatment may be to delay the onset of episodes of depression by varying periods, which may still represent a clinically beneficial change. Some studies used survival analysis to capture this, but it is not reported in this review. It is also possible that treatment may reduce the severity of subsequent episodes (<LINK REF="REF-Montgomery-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Montgomery 1992</LINK>) which, again, may be of clinical benefit but is not addressed in this review.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Limitations in study design or execution (risk of bias)</HEADING>
<P>All of the trials were randomised and double-blind. However, only one trial specifically discusses whether blinding of psychological therapies was successful (<LINK REF="STD-Wilkinson-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Wilkinson 2009</LINK>). Allocation concealment was unclear in four of the seven studies. We judged two studies to have employed selective reporting of outcome data.</P>
<P>The clinical effects of discontinuing antidepressants in placebo-controlled maintenance trials could increase the apparent rates of relapse and recurrence in placebo arms thereby increasing in the apparent efficacy of antidepressants (<LINK REF="REF-Montgomery-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Montgomery 1992</LINK>). This would be most likely if careful dose titration is not employed. In the three studies in this review employing placebo antidepressant arms, procedures for antidepressant withdrawal were not clear.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Inconsistency of results</HEADING>
<P>Data were incomplete in places, for instance on the timing of drop-outs in <LINK REF="STD-Reynolds-1999a" TYPE="STUDY">Reynolds 1999a</LINK>; so, in this review, we assumed that all drop-outs were in the first year of follow-up. Drop-out rates varied between studies from 0% (<LINK REF="STD-Alexopoulos-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Alexopoulos 2000</LINK>) to 22% (<LINK REF="STD-Klysner-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Klysner 2002</LINK>). A sensitivity analysis omitting <LINK REF="STD-Klysner-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Klysner 2002</LINK> did not affect overall the outcome.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Indirectness of evidence</HEADING>
<P>All studies directly addressed the main review question, that of prevention of relapse and recurrence in older people remitted from an episode of depression while taking antidepressant medication.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Imprecision</HEADING>
<P>There was a low number of studies in the review. For instance, only one study reported data on the primary outcome of overall drop-outs at 12 months in antidepressant medication versus placebo.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Publication bias</HEADING>
<P>We produced a funnel plot to assess possible publication bias in the trials included in the main comparison (antidepressants versus placebo) (<LINK REF="FIG-10" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 10</LINK>). The total number of studies (fewer than 10) means that application of a formal test of asymmetry was not appropriate. Simple visual inspection suggested possible publication bias with under-reporting of small trials showing no effect; however, we identified no unpublished studies in communications with experts and known researchers in the field.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2016-08-18 18:37:27 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Sarah Dawson">
<P>The search in this review was based on the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders (CCMD) Controlled Register of Trials (which is largely composed of searches of already published literature), as well as the review authors' own searches. Therefore, it is possible that there are unpublished trials that we are not aware of although it is expected that these would have been identified through the communications that were made with experts and researchers in the field.</P>
<P>It is clear that there was significant between-trial clinical heterogeneity in this review. For instance, participants in some trials were more cognitively impaired, some had greater physical morbidity, some were older on average, and some had been treated as inpatients. Some trials used more stringent criteria for remission before randomisation, while run-in and dose-tapering periods varied between trials.</P>
<P>Another potential source of heterogeneity was the range of psychological treatments included in the review. However, only one analysis combined results from different psychological treatments (combination versus antidepressants at 12 months) and heterogeneity was low. This potential source of heterogeneity might be addressed in future versions of this review by categorising psychological treatments, for instance, including problem-solving therapies in CBT.</P>
<P>For the purposes of this review, we treated medication clinic and placebo in <LINK REF="STD-Reynolds-1999b" TYPE="STUDY">Reynolds 1999b</LINK> as a pure placebo condition. Face-to-face clinician contact in the medication clinic could be regarded as making this an active intervention. However, we believe this to be an adequate comparison as it helps to control for the effect of clinician contact in the parallel psychological treatment condition, IPT.</P>
<P>Recruiting older people to clinical research trials can be difficult due to the burden of research, and communication difficulties, etc. (<LINK REF="REF-Forster-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Forster 2010</LINK>). Therefore, selection bias in studies may have arisen in this review if the participants who were successfully recruited were not representative of people in the general clinical population.</P>
<P>When study sponsors have an interest in the outcome of a study, there is a risk of bias in the reporting of results. This review did not include data on funding source of studies so the potential for funding bias was not assessed.</P>
<P>Despite the differences between trials, we believe that meta-analysis was appropriate. We addressed heterogeneity using the random-effects model in meta-analysis as this allows for clinical heterogeneity between trial populations. The random-effects model does emphasise the results from smaller trials, which are often those most prone to bias. However, when we performed a fixed-effect analysis for the main finding of the review (reduced recurrence rates for antidepressant medication versus placebo at 12 months), there was no difference in the overall relative risks calculated. We also examined the effects of clinical heterogeneity using sensitivity analysis with change in overall findings.</P>
<P>This review used a point-in-time dichotomous outcome (recurrence rate from intention-to-treat analyses) for the main meta-analysis. While we believe this to be the most appropriate method for the review, it is acknowledged that it may produce more conservative estimates of treatment effect than survival analysis and use of hazard ratios (<LINK REF="REF-Michiels-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Michiels 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>Some of the analyses in this review used very small numbers of studies and may not have had sufficient statistical power to detect small effect sizes. However, we did not perform a power calculation to assess this.</P>
<P>The effects of antidepressant discontinuation can be misinterpreted as symptoms of depression recurrence. Therefore, there is an argument for excluding recurrences in the first four weeks of randomisation from analysis, although we did not apply this strategy in this review.</P>
</POTENTIAL_BIASES>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2016-08-08 14:45:27 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson">
<P>In one review of RCTs of continuation/maintenance antidepressant treatment with adults of all ages, five of 31 included trials were with older adults, although there was no separate analysis of these trials (<LINK REF="REF-Geddes-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Geddes 2003</LINK>). Continuing treatment with antidepressants reduced the odds of relapse by 70%, compared with a reduction in this review (specifically with adults aged 60 years and over) of 52% at final outcome.</P>
<P>Kok et al. evaluated the efficacy of antidepressant treatment in the prevention of recurrence of depression in older people through a systematic review of literature and meta-analysis of seven RCTs (<LINK REF="REF-Kok-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kok 2011</LINK>). We excluded two trials that were included in Kok's meta-analysis from this review: the first because it included participants aged 55 years and above with no separate analysis of data from participants aged 60 years and above (<LINK REF="REF-Georgotas-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Georgotas 1989</LINK>); and the second because participants were allowed to continue augmentation treatments after randomisation (<LINK REF="STD-Reynolds-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Reynolds 2006</LINK>). We included the other six trials from Kok's review in the equivalent comparison in this review. There were also some methodological differences in Kok's meta-analysis: only final follow-up data from six to 36 months were pooled, with no breakdown by follow-up interval; drop-outs from treatment were not included in recurrences/relapses; and in extracting data from <LINK REF="STD-Reynolds-1999a" TYPE="STUDY">Reynolds 1999a</LINK>, Kok et al. combined data from participants receiving interpersonal psychological therapies with participants in drug placebo arms. However, despite the differences between the reviews, Kok et al. reported a comparable NNTB of 3.6 (to be rounded to 4) to prevent one additional recurrence/relapse, and no difference in tolerability between TCAs and SSRIs.</P>
<P>Frederick et al. reported an expert-panel informed narrative review of treatments for late-life depression, but this did not include continuation or maintenance treatments (<LINK REF="REF-Frederick-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Frederick 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>The review authors are not aware of any other reviews of trials of continuation/maintenance psychological therapies in late-life depression.</P>

<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2016-08-09 08:14:06 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2016-08-08 22:42:53 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson">
<P>As far as the review authors are aware, this is the first systematic review of both antidepressants and psychological therapies in the prevention of recurrence of depression in people aged 60 years and over who have recovered from a depressive illness while taking antidepressant medication. Although there was a significant reduction in recurrence rates in three trials comparing selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors or tricyclic antidepressants with placebo medication at 12 months' follow-up, the meta-analysis was relatively underpowered due to small sample sizes; analyses at other time points did not reach statistical significance. In addition, the quality of this evidence was low as assessed with the GRADE guideline development tool. Therefore, on the basis of this review, we can make no firm recommendations on the optimum period of antidepressant maintenance treatment with older adults. Therefore, the best evidence to date comes from trials with adults of all ages (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2010</LINK>), which is to continue treatment for at least six months, or for two years or longer if there is a known high likelihood of recurrence or significant clinical risks. As trials reported significant numbers of drop-outs, it is possible that the benefit of treatment is greater in people remaining on antidepressant medication. There was no difference in treatment acceptability (as measured by overall drop-outs and drop-outs due to adverse effects) or death rates between antidepressant and placebo.</P>
<P>There was no significant overall benefit for antidepressant treatment at 24 months' follow-up in four trials with 282 participants, but when we combined data from the three trials of tricyclic antidepressant medication (169 participants), there was a significant reduction in recurrence (number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) = 5). In the one trial that followed up participants taking a tricyclic antidepressant for 36 months, there was evidence of benefit of treatment compared with placebo (NNTB = 4). Thus, it is possible that tricyclic antidepressants have significant longer-term benefits (two to three years) in the prevention of recurrence of depression.</P>
<P>On the basis of this review, it is not possible to make recommendations on the characteristics of people most likely to benefit from long-term antidepressant treatment.</P>
<P>There were only two small trials of psychological therapies in the review and we can make no firm recommendations on the use of psychological therapies in the prevention of recurrence in older adults. Therefore, the best evidence to date comes from trials with adults of all ages (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2010</LINK>), which is to consider cognitive behavioural therapy or mindfulness-based cognitive therapy if depression is recurrent. It is possible that in 'younger old' adults (aged 60 to 70 years) without significant physical health problems or cognitive impairment, IPT may be as efficacious as tricyclic antidepressant at preventing recurrence for up to three years.</P>
<P>The effects of combining psychological therapies with antidepressant are also unclear. Combined data from the two trials showed no significant benefit of combination compared with antidepressant therapy alone. In one trial, psychological therapies appeared as effective as combined treatment at 12 months' follow-up, but not in longer-term follow-up.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2016-08-09 08:14:06 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson">
<P>This review included only a small number of trials with small numbers of participants. Larger trials are needed to confirm the longer-term benefits of antidepressant medication in older people.  A direct comparison of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors with tricyclic antidepressants would determine whether tricyclic antidepressants are superior and equally acceptable in older people; this might include both low- and high-dose tricyclic antidepressant arms as there is a trade-off between clinical benefits and adverse effects with this class of antidepressant (<LINK REF="STD-Reynolds-1999b" TYPE="STUDY">Reynolds 1999b</LINK>).</P>
<P>Despite the apparent benefit of maintaining antidepressant treatment, one-year recurrence rates in people remaining on treatment are high (around 50% in this review). Thus, it is important that future research identifies additional strategies that might improve outcomes. This research should include further, larger trials of a broader range of interventions, including psychological therapies. In one study by <LINK REF="REF-Reynolds-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reynolds 2011</LINK>, the addition of the cholinesterase inhibitor donepezil to maintenance antidepressant medication did not further reduce recurrence rate.</P>
<P>Trial participants in this review were mainly the &#8216;younger old&#8217; and physically well. A further study with participants aged 70 years and over demonstrated benefit from antidepressant medication but a poorer response to interpersonal psychological therapies (<LINK REF="STD-Reynolds-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Reynolds 2006</LINK>, excluded from this review). Some large and important studies addressing maintenance treatments do include older adults in among adults of all ages. For instance, a study of mindfulness-based cognitive therapy published since the original review included participants up to 79 years of age but without separate analysis of data from older participants (<LINK REF="REF-Kuyken-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kuyken 2015</LINK>). We believe that it is important that future trials of maintenance treatments in late-life depression, both with antidepressants and psychological therapies, are conducted solely with populations of participants representative of older adults increasingly encountered in routine clinic practice, that is, over 70 years of age, experiencing mild-to-moderate cognitive impairment, and with comorbid physical illnesses. This would properly address the impact of age-related clinical factors on response to different treatment modalities. It is also important to understand the precise role of neuropsychological deficits in late-life depression better and the extent to which they are reversed by treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Korsnes-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Korsnes 2015</LINK>).</P>
<P>Future studies should examine the reasons for drop-out and include quality of life measures and cost-effectiveness analysis.</P>

<P>After the publication of the original protocol, the method for assessing trial quality in Cochrane reviews changed. Accordingly, contrary to the original protocol, trial quality was assessed using Cochrane's tool for assessing risk of bias (see <LINK TAG="METHODS" TYPE="SECTION">Methods</LINK>).</P>
<P>After the publication of the protocol, the use of I<SUP>2</SUP> for assessing clinical heterogeneity changed from a simple threshold of 50% for significant heterogeneity to graded thresholds.</P>
<P>After publication, we amended the original protocol to included cluster-randomised and cross-over trials.</P>
<P>After the publication of the original protocol, we decided to perform a subgroup analysis of recurrence rates in trials of tricyclic antidepressants.</P>
<P>In line with revised <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> guidance, we made recurrence rate a primary outcome for benefit and overall drop-out rate at 12 months a primary outcome for harm. We made relapse and recurrence rates at other six monthly time points and final follow-up secondary outcomes.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">1. Effects of interventions</HEADING>
<P>There is no forest plot for IPT+ADs versus IPT as we were asked to cut down the number of plots before publication and this is one that was cut. The findings for comparison 6 are presented in the text of the original review and a forest plot has been added to this update (<LINK REF="FIG-09" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 9</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">2. Comparison 2: Psychological therapies versus TAU/waiting list/placebo</HEADING>
<P>We regarded placebo/medication clinic as placebo medication comparison for the purposes of the review and this was accepted by the referees and editors of the original review. This has been addressed in the update (see <LINK TAG="POTENTIAL_BIASES" TYPE="SECTION">Potential biases in the review process</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">3. Comparisons 3, 4, 5 (Figures 4, 5, 6)</HEADING>
<P>The discrepancy between the numbers reported in the included study (Reynolds 1999a) and those reported in our review result from the different handling of drop-outs. The study authors used censoring of drop-outs for their survival analysis, whereas we used the more conservative intention-to-treat for our time-in-point analysis. This approach was discussed in referee feedback prior to publication of the review and is stated in the original review and in this update (see <LINK TAG="QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE" TYPE="SECTION">Quality of the evidence</LINK>).</P>
<P>For the purposes of our review, we assumed all drop-outs to have occurred during year one of follow-up as the study authors were unable to provide us precise timings. See table.</P>

<P>The Specialised Register of the Cochrane Collaboration Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Group (CCDAN) was searched using the following terms:</P>
<P>1. <B>The CCDANCTR-Studies Register </B>was searched up to 22 June 2012 using the following terms:<BR/>Condition = (Depress* or Dysthymi* or Adjustment Disorder*" or Mood Disorder*" or "Affective Disorder*" or "Affective Symptoms") AND Age Group = Aged AND Free-text = (relaps* or recurre* or reoccurre* or remission or prophyla* or ((continuation or maintenance) and (*therap* or treatment*)) or ((long-term or "long term") and (tolera* or treatment* or *therap*)))</P>
<P>2. <B>The CCDANCTR-References Register</B> was searched up to 22 June 2012 using a more sensitive set of free-text terms to identify additional untagged/uncoded references:<BR/>(Depress* or Dysthymi* or Adjustment Disorder*" or Mood Disorder*" or "Affective Disorder*" or "Affective Symptoms") AND (relaps* or recurre* or reoccurre* or remission or prophyla* or ((continuation or maintenance) and (*therap* or treatment*)) or ((long-term or "long term") and (tolera* or treatment* or *therap*))) AND ((aging or ageing or elder* or frail or geriatric* or seniors or retired or late-life* or "late life*" or "later life" or "late adulthood" or "old age" or "old people" or "older people" or "old person*" or "older person*" or "old citizen*" or "older citizen*" or "old adult*" or "older adult*" or "old men" or "older men" or "old women" or "older women" or "old male*" or "older male*" or "old female*" or "older female*" or "old patient*" or "older patient*" or "old population*" or "older population*" or "old old" or old-old or "very old" or "senior citizen*" or pensioner* or retired or retirement or sedentary or "care home*" or "nursing home*") or Keywords = (aged or "middle age*") or Abstract = ("60 years" or "65 years" or "70 years" or "75 years" or "80 years" or "85 years" or "90 years" or "95 years" or "older than 60" or "older than 65" or "older than 70" or "older than 75" or "older than 80" or "older than 85" or "older than 90" or "older than 95"))</P>
<P>N.B. The Group changed its name to 'Common Mental Disorders' in 2015 and this register is now known as the CCMDCTR.</P>
