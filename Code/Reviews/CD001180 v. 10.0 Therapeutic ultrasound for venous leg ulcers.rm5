<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2017-05-11 22:26:14 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nicky Cullum">
<P>
<B>What are venous leg ulcers, and who is at risk?</B>
</P>
<P>Venous leg ulcers are common wounds caused by damage or blockages in leg veins. This leads to pooling of blood and increased pressure in these veins. Eventually these changes can damage the skin and underlying tissue and form a long-lasting wound, or ulcer. These ulcers can be painful and leak fluid. They can also become infected. People at risk of developing venous leg ulcers include the elderly and those with mobility problems. They can be distressing for patients and costly to healthcare systems.</P>
<P>
<B>Why use ultrasound to treat leg ulcers?</B>
</P>
<P>Treatments for venous leg ulcers include compression bandages, which improve blood-flow in the legs, wound dressings, and medication such as antibiotics. Ultrasound therapy is sometimes used as an additional intervention, especially for difficult, long-standing ulcers. Sound waves are passed through the skin causing the tissue underneath to vibrate. The mechanisms by which ultrasound waves interact with healing tissues are not fully understood; they may have a positive or negative impact on the blood flow around the ulcers. We wanted to discover whether using ultrasound therapy can improve the healing of leg ulcers.</P>
<P>
<B>What we found?</B>
</P>
<P>In September 2016 we searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that investigated whether ultrasound helps to heal or improves the symptoms of venous leg ulcers. We found 11 trials involving a total of 969 participants. The average (mean) age of participants ranged from 59 years to 70 years. The proportion of female participants ranged from 55% to 79%. Eight studies compared ultrasound with use of no ultrasound for venous leg ulcers and the other three compared ultrasound with sham ultrasound. Seven out of the eleven studies were at high risk of bias and we could not assess the potential bias in three studies due to poor reporting. One study was at low risk of bias. The trials were all different, for example in their duration of follow-up (three weeks to 12 months), and the strength of the ultrasound waves used (high or low frequency ultrasound). It is not clear from this evidence whether ultrasound (high or low frequency) increases the healing of venous leg ulcers. The results of one study (337 participants) suggest that high-frequency ultrasound may be associated with more adverse events such as pain and skin redness (moderate quality evidence). The two studies that evaluated low-frequency ultrasound did not report whether participants experienced side effects. It is also uncertain whether either high- or low-frequency ultrasound affects participants' quality of life.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence </B>
</P>
<P>Most of the studies we found did not have many participants, had short follow-up times and had weaknesses of study design that meant they were quite likely to give a misleading result. We consider the available evidence to be low quality due to these risks of bias.</P>
<P>This plain language summary is up to date as of September 2016.</P>

<P>Venous leg ulcers are a type of chronic, recurring, complex wound that is more common in people aged over 65 years. Venous ulcers pose a significant burden to patients and healthcare systems. While compression therapy (such as bandages or stockings) is an effective first-line treatment, ultrasound may have a role to play in healing venous ulcers.</P>

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2017-05-02 09:18:08 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Wounds Specialised Register (searched 19 September 2016); the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; the Cochrane Library 2016, Issue 8); Ovid MEDLINE (including In-Process &amp; Other Non-Indexed Citations, MEDLINE Daily and Epub Ahead of Print) (1946 to 19 September 2016); Ovid Embase (1974 to 19 September 2016); and EBSCO CINAHL Plus (1937 to 19 September 2016). We also searched three clinical trials registries and the references of included studies and relevant systematic reviews. There were no restrictions based on language, date of publication or study setting.</P>

</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-05-11 22:25:54 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nicky Cullum">
<P>Eleven trials are included in this update; 10 of these we judged to be at an unclear or high risk of bias. The trials were clinically heterogeneous with differences in duration of follow-up, and ultrasound regimens. Nine trials evaluated high frequency ultrasound; seven studies provided data for ulcers healed and two provided data on change in ulcer size only. Two trials evaluated low frequency ultrasound and both reported ulcers healed data.</P>
<P>It is uncertain whether high frequency ultrasound affects the proportion of ulcers healed compared with no ultrasound at any of the time points evaluated: at seven to eight weeks (RR 1.21, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.71; 6 trials, 678 participants; low quality evidence - downgraded once for risk of bias and once for imprecision); at 12 weeks (RR 1.26, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.73; 3 trials, 489 participants; moderate quality evidence - downgraded once for imprecision); and at 12 months (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.18; 1 trial, 337 participants; low quality evidence - downgraded once for unclear risk of bias and once for imprecision).</P>
<P>One trial (92 participants) reported that a greater percentage reduction in ulcer area was achieved at four weeks with high-frequency ultrasound, while another (73 participants) reported no clear difference in change in ulcer size at seven weeks. We downgraded the level of this evidence to very low, mainly for risk of bias (typically lack of blinded outcome assessment and attrition) and imprecision.</P>
<P>Data from one trial (337 participants) suggest that high frequency ultrasound may increase the risk of non-serious adverse events (RR 1.29, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.64; moderate quality evidence - downgraded once for imprecision) and serious adverse events (RR 1.21, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.89; moderate quality evidence downgraded once for imprecision).</P>
<P>It is uncertain whether low frequency ultrasound affects venous ulcer healing at eight and 12 weeks (RR 3.91, 95% CI 0.47 to 32.85; 2 trials, 61 participants; very low quality evidence (downgraded for risk of bias and imprecision)).</P>
<P>High-frequency ultrasound probably makes little or no difference to quality of life (moderate quality evidence, downgraded for imprecision). The outcomes of adverse effects, quality of life and cost were not reported for low-frequency ultrasound treatment.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2017-03-01 15:00:03 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>A venous leg ulcer can be defined as "an open sore in the skin of the lower leg due to high pressure of the blood in the leg veins" (<LINK REF="REF-British-Association-of-Dermatologists-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">British Association of Dermatologists 2010</LINK>). Venous insufficiency is a term used most frequently to describe the lack of flow (stasis) of venous blood in the lower limbs. The stasis and pooling of blood in the venous system can be caused by dysfunctional valves of the superficial or deep venous system, deep venous outflow obstruction, or failure of the muscular pump mechanism of the lower limbs (<LINK REF="REF-Valencia-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Valencia 2001</LINK>). The exact pathophysiology behind skin damage and ulcer formation in venous insufficiency is not known; multiple hypotheses include white cell trapping, growth factor trapping, pericapillary fibrin cuffs and fibrinolytic abnormalities (<LINK REF="REF-Valencia-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Valencia 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>The prevalence of active venous leg ulceration has been variously estimated as 0.29 per 1000 population (95% confidence interval 0.25 to 0.33 per 1000) (<LINK REF="REF-Hall-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hall 2014</LINK>), and 1% of the adult population in the western world (<LINK REF="REF-Donnelly-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Donnelly 2009</LINK>). Leg ulcers are more common among women and prevalence increases with age (<LINK REF="REF-Callam-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Callam 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Margolis-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Margolis 2002</LINK>), reaching up to 3% in adults aged 65 years and over (<LINK REF="REF-Donnelly-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Donnelly 2009</LINK>). The incidence of venous ulceration in the elderly population has been estimated at 0.76/100 person-years for men, and 1.42/100 person-years for women (<LINK REF="REF-Margolis-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Margolis 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>Active ulceration is known to have a profoundly detrimental effect upon quality of life, inflicting significant pain and restriction in mobility, which result in limitations of physical and social roles (<LINK REF="REF-Carradice-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carradice 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Michaels-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Michaels 2009</LINK>). Typically, ulcers produce exudate, reduce mobility and can incapacitate, causing social isolation (<LINK REF="REF-Graham-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Graham 2003</LINK>). Reported healing times vary, but are often long; sometimes healing takes many years. One large trial found that even with treatment and close monitoring, only 65% of ulcers healed within 24 weeks, and only around 90% within three years (<LINK REF="REF-Barwell-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barwell 2004</LINK>). Once healed, recurrence is frequent, with recurrence rates of 26% to 70% within the year after healing (<LINK REF="REF-Barwell-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barwell 2004</LINK>). Ulcer management is costly due to the need for frequent changes of dressing, home visits, and hospitalisation (<LINK REF="REF-Olin-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Olin 1999</LINK>). The financial cost of treating an unhealed leg ulcer in the UK has most recently been estimated at around GBP 1700 per year (price year 2012) (<LINK REF="REF-Ashby-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ashby 2014</LINK>); and venous leg ulcers alone have been estimated to cost between GBP 300 million and GBP 600 million per year in health expenditure (<LINK REF="REF-Posnett-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Posnett 2008</LINK>). Younger people of working age also experience venous leg ulcers (<LINK REF="REF-Nelzen-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nelzen 1994</LINK>), and their reduced ability to participate in the labour market adds to the economic impact of this disease (<LINK REF="REF-Lafuma-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lafuma 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ruckley-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ruckley 1997</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2017-05-08 14:56:12 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The effects of therapeutic ultrasound have been explored in a diverse array of conditions including fractures (<LINK REF="REF-Busse-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Busse 2009</LINK>), osteoarthritis (<LINK REF="REF-Robinson-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Robinson 2001</LINK>), rheumatoid arthritis (<LINK REF="REF-Casimiro-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Casimiro 2002</LINK>), ankle sprains (<LINK REF="REF-Van-der-Windt-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van der Windt 2002</LINK>), pelvic and perineal pain (<LINK REF="REF-Hay_x002d_Smith-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hay-Smith 1998</LINK>) and pressure ulcers (<LINK REF="REF-Akbari-Sari-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Akbari Sari 2006</LINK>). Therapeutic ultrasound has been proposed as a solution for venous leg ulcers that are difficult to treat, and a systematic review is required in order to summarize the results of existing studies accurately.</P>
<P>A typical therapeutic ultrasound device consists of a generator that is linked to an applicator head; this enables delivery of multiple frequencies in a continuous, or pulsed, manner. Ultrasound is administered directly, by application of the applicator head to the skin, usually with a coupling agent (direct ultrasound) (<LINK REF="REF-Hart-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hart 1998</LINK>), or indirectly, where the affected area is placed in a constant-temperature water bath and the ultrasound administered through the water. Directly-applied ultrasound is usually applied to the skin around the ulcer (periulcer skin) rather than directly to the ulcer. Most trials in venous leg ulcers use a pulsed ultrasound, with a frequency range of 1 MHz to 3 MHz, and intensity of 0.5 W/cm<SUP>2</SUP> to 1 W/cm<SUP>2</SUP>, for a duration of five to 10 minutes, although there does not seem to be any evidence base for this particular regimen (<LINK REF="REF-Hart-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hart 1998</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2017-05-08 09:36:42 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The effects of therapeutic ultrasound are classified as either thermal or non-thermal on the basis of the proposed physiological effects (<LINK REF="REF-Baker-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baker 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Dyson-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dyson 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Johns-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johns 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ter-Haar-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ter Haar 1999</LINK>). Careful choice of the exposure time, intensity and continuous movement of the ultrasound applicator are described as important factors to consider in the delivery of therapeutic ultrasound (<LINK REF="REF-McCulloch-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">McCulloch 2010</LINK>).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Thermal effects</HEADING>
<P>The thermal effects of ultrasound are achieved by using a higher intensity application to achieve, and maintain, a rise in tissue temperature to around 40°C (<LINK REF="REF-Dyson-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dyson 1987</LINK>). Thermal effects have been hypothesised as being capable of increasing blood flow (<LINK REF="REF-Dyson-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dyson 1987</LINK>), although some trials concluded that there was no obvious effect (<LINK REF="REF-Hansen-1973" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hansen 1973</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hogan-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hogan 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Paul-1955" TYPE="REFERENCE">Paul 1955</LINK>). It has been suggested that the thermal effects of ultrasound produce favourable changes in the physical attributes of collagen-rich structures (<LINK REF="REF-Dyson-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dyson 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ter-Haar-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ter Haar 1999</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Non-thermal effects</HEADING>
<P>The non-thermal effects of ultrasound are thought to be due to two ultrasound-induced phenomena:</P>

<B>acoustic streaming:</B> flow and displacement of particles in a fluid medium due to the physical forces of sound waves (<LINK REF="REF-Baker-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baker 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Johns-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johns 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ter-Haar-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ter Haar 1999</LINK>).

<P>Many in vitro studies investigating the non-thermal effect of therapeutic ultrasound on the different elements of tissue healing have been conducted.

It is not clear, however, whether these effects can be reproduced in vivo, and, while some argue that the biophysical phenomena (cavitation and acoustic streaming) do not occur in vivo (<LINK REF="REF-Baker-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baker 2001</LINK>), there are conflicting results from different studies (<LINK REF="REF-Carstensen-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carstensen 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ter-Haar-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ter Haar 1981</LINK>).

<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2017-03-01 15:00:12 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The effectiveness of ultrasound in enhancing the healing of tissue both in vivo and in vitro is uncertain. The delivery of ultrasound requires investment of health resources and patient time, and the equipment can be a potential vector for hospital-acquired (nosocomial) infection (<LINK REF="REF-Schabrun-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schabrun 2006</LINK>), therefore, we need to establish whether ultrasound speeds the healing of venous ulcers. In the face of these uncertainties, an up-to-date review investigating the possible therapeutic effects of ultrasound in venous leg ulcers is important.</P>

<P>Two review authors independently assessed each included study, without blinding to journal or authorship, using the Cochrane tool for assessing risk of bias (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). This tool addresses six specific domains, namely sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding, incomplete outcome data, selective outcome reporting and other issues (e.g. extreme baseline imbalance) (see <LINK REF="APP-06" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 6</LINK> for details of assessment criteria). We assessed blinding and completeness of outcome data separately for each outcome. We completed a risk of bias table for each eligible study. Both review authors discussed any disagreement to achieve a consensus (see <LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>).</P>
<P>We present an assessment of risk of bias using a 'Risk of bias' summary figure (<LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>), which presents all of the judgments in a cross-tabulation of study by entry. This display of internal validity indicates the weight the reader may give the results of each study. Studies were classed as being at high risk of bias if they were rated as 'high risk' for any of the four key criteria (random sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding of outcome assessment and incomplete outcome data addressed) and they were classed as being at 'unclear risk' if they had at least one unclear criterion, with the remainder classed as 'low risk'.</P>
</QUALITY_ASSESSMENT>
<EFFECT_MEASURES MODIFIED="2017-04-03 10:33:16 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Zhenmi Liu">
<P>For dichotomous outcomes we calculated the risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). For continuous outcomes that used the same assessment scale we used the mean difference (MD) with 95% CIs. If trials used different assessment scales, we used the standardised mean difference (SMD) with 95% CIs. We only considered mean or median time to healing without survival analysis as a valid outcome if reports specified that all wounds healed. Time-to-event data (e.g. time-to-complete wound healing) were reported as hazard ratios (HR) where possible, in accordance with the methods described in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions </I>(<LINK REF="REF-Deeks-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deeks 2011</LINK>). If studies reporting time-to-event data (e.g. time to healing) did not report a hazard ratio, then, where feasible, we planned to estimate this using other reported outcomes, such as the number of events, through the application of available statistical methods (<LINK REF="REF-Parmar-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parmar 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>For dichotomous outcomes we also present absolute risk differences in the <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK> and <LINK REF="SOF-02" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 2</LINK>. Hoffrage and colleagues suggested that physicians&#8217; inferences about statistical outcomes are more appropriate when they deal with &#8216;natural frequencies&#8217; &#8211; whole numbers of people, both treated and untreated, than when effects are presented as percentages (<LINK REF="REF-Hoffrage-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hoffrage 2000</LINK>). In this case, we presented our outcomes as anticipated absolute effects.</P>

<UNIT_OF_ANALYSIS MODIFIED="2017-03-02 11:22:11 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Where studies randomised participants and reported outcomes for wounds, and the number of wounds appeared to be equal to the number of participants, we treated the participant as the unit of analysis.</P>
<P>We had anticipated a possible unit of analysis issue if: individual participants with multiple wounds were randomised; the allocated treatment was used on multiple wounds per participant (or perhaps only on some participants); and if data were presented and analysed by wound not person. This is a type of clustered data and presents a unit of analysis error that inflates precision. In cases where included studies contained some or only clustered data, we planned to report this alongside whether data had been (incorrectly) treated as independent. We recorded this as part of the 'Risk of bias' assessment. We did not plan to undertake further calculation to adjust for clustering.</P>
</UNIT_OF_ANALYSIS>
<MISSING_DATA MODIFIED="2017-03-01 15:11:03 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>High rates of withdrawal from trials are common in chronic wounds research, and trialists have tended to exclude withdrawn and 'lost' participants from analysis. This approach clearly disrupts randomisation, and has a high potential for introducing bias - largely by ignoring participants who have failed to heal. For the main analysis we have, therefore, regarded participants who were lost to follow-up (i.e. randomised but do not appear in the analysis) as unhealed - where healing was the main endpoint - as this seems the most plausible outcome, however, we have also tested this approach by conducting complete case analyses (see <LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>).</P>
<P>Since in a time-to-healing analysis that uses survival analysis methods, drop-outs are accounted for as censored data, we took no action regarding missing data.</P>
<P>For continuous variables, for example, cost and for all secondary outcomes, we presented available data from the study reports or study authors and did not anticipate imputing missing data. We calculated missing measures of variance where possible. If calculation was not possible, we contacted the study authors. Where these measures of variation were not available, we excluded the study from any meta-analyses.</P>

<P>Assessment of heterogeneity can be a complex, multi-faceted process. Firstly, we planned to consider clinical and methodological heterogeneity, that is the degree to which the included studies varied in terms of participants, interventions, outcomes and characteristics such as length of follow-up. We supplemented this assessment of clinical and methodological heterogeneity with information regarding statistical heterogeneity gained by using the Chi² test (we would consider a significance level of P &lt; 0.10 to indicate statistically significant heterogeneity) in conjunction with the I<SUP>2</SUP> measure (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2003</LINK>). I<SUP>2</SUP> examines the percentage of total variation across RCTs that is due to heterogeneity rather than chance (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2003</LINK>). Very broadly, we consider that I<SUP>2</SUP> values of 25% or less may mean a low level of heterogeneity (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2003</LINK>), and values of 75% or more indicate very high heterogeneity (<A HREF="https://archie.cochrane.org/sections/documents/view?version=z1507101054474756234243102693482&amp;format=REVMAN#REF-Deeks-2011">Deeks 2011</A>). Where there was evidence of high heterogeneity we anticipated exploring this further where possible: see <A HREF="https://archie.cochrane.org/sections/documents/view?version=z1507101054474756234243102693482&amp;format=REVMAN#DATA_SYNTHESIS">Data synthesis</A>.</P>

<P>We combined the studies included in the review by narrative overview, with meta-analysis of appropriate data conducted with Review Manager 5.3 software (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2014</LINK>). We planned to assess clinical and methodological heterogeneity and anticipated pooling data when studies appeared similar in terms of intervention type, duration of follow-up and outcome type. In terms of a meta-analytical approach, in the presence of clinical heterogeneity (review author judgement), or evidence of statistical heterogeneity, or both, we used a random-effects model. We planned to use a fixed-effect approach only when clinical heterogeneity was thought to be minimal and statistical heterogeneity was estimated as non-statistically significant for the Chi<SUP>2</SUP> value and 0% for the I<SUP>2 </SUP>assessment (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>For dichotomous outcomes we present the summary estimate as a risk ratio (RR) with 95% CI.

For time-to-event data, we planned to plot (and, if appropriate, pool) estimates of hazard ratios and 95% CIs as presented in the study reports using the generic inverse variance method in RevMan 5.3.

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Outcomes</HEADING>
<P>Wound healing trialists vary hugely in their selection and reporting of outcome measures, and there is very little methodological research to validate the wound outcome measures used. Arguably, time to wound healing is the most patient-oriented outcome, since, even in trials of treatments for chronic wounds, the majority do achieve healing. Survival analysis is the most appropriate strategy for analysing a time-to-event outcome such as time-to-healing, with hazard ratio as the effect measure; however, this is very rarely used. Three trials used life table methods to compare healing rates (<LINK REF="STD-Callam-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Callam 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lundeberg-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Lundeberg 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Peschen-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Peschen 1997</LINK>), but did not undertake any adjustment for imbalances and did not report hazard ratios, whilst <LINK REF="STD-Watson-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Watson 2011</LINK> conducted full survival analysis, implemented the Cox proportional hazards model and reported the hazard ratio. Eight trials reported the proportion of ulcers completely healed at arbitrary and varying follow-up times (duration of follow-up ranged from three weeks in <LINK REF="STD-Franek-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Franek 2004</LINK> to 12 weeks in <LINK REF="STD-Callam-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Callam 1987</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Lundeberg-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Lundeberg 1990</LINK>, and <LINK REF="STD-Peschen-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Peschen 1997</LINK>); the remaining four trials reported healing by seven or eight weeks (<LINK REF="STD-Callam-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Callam 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dolibog-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Dolibog 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lundeberg-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Lundeberg 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Watson-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Watson 2011</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Watson-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Watson 2011</LINK> reported median time to healing and the hazard ratio, but on request also supplied proportions of participants with healed ulcers at eight weeks, 12 weeks and 12 months. <LINK REF="STD-Franek-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Franek 2006</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Taradaj-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Taradaj 2007</LINK> only provided data on change in ulcer size at four and seven weeks respectively, without any healed data available.</P>

<P>Determination of whether a wound has healed or not involves judgement, and thus can be influenced by an assessor's knowledge of the treatment allocation.

In <LINK REF="STD-Watson-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Watson 2011</LINK>, photographs were taken by unblinded staff and healing judged from the photographs by assessors who were blinded to treatment allocation: we rated this as being at a low risk of detection bias.

<P>The results of <LINK REF="STD-Franek-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Franek 2004</LINK> should be viewed with extreme caution for several reasons; apart from the paucity of endpoint data due to the brief follow-up, the trial arms received systematically different co interventions and the study was likely to be subject to important performance bias. We have included it here since we did not pre specify that we would exclude trials where ultrasound was not the only systematic difference in treatments. The trial involved three treatment arms: two ultrasound arms (1 W/cm<SUP>2</SUP> and 0.5 W/cm<SUP>2</SUP>) and a control arm with no ultrasound. However, the control group received co interventions (in the form of local wound treatments) that were not received by the ultrasound groups (potassium permanganate and wet dressings of 0.1M copper sulphate solution plus compresses of fibrolan, chloramphenicol, colistin, and gentamicin), and were treated in a different hospital. At three weeks, complete healing had occurred in 1/22 (4.5%) of the group receiving 1 W/cm<SUP>2</SUP> ultrasound, 3/21 (14.3%) of the group receiving 0.5 W/cm<SUP>2</SUP> ultrasound, and 1/22 (4.5%) of people receiving no ultrasound. For the purposes of the main analysis we have pooled both ultrasound arms and compared them with no ultrasound. This preserves randomisation, but results in unequally sized groups. There was no clear difference in the proportion of ulcers healed with ultrasound compared with no ultrasound at three weeks (RR 2.05, 95% CI 0.24 to 17.23; <LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>). <I>Using the GRADE approach, we judged the quality of evidence for this result to be very low (downgraded twice for risk of bias given the problems of design and twice for extreme imprecision)</I>; see <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>.</P>

Participants in both groups exhibited lower mean PCS and MCS than the general population of the USA, suggesting the leg ulcer patients in this trial had lower HRQoL than the USA population of a similar age (<LINK REF="STD-Watson-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Watson 2011</LINK>). <I>The quality of evidence was</I> <I>moderate, downgraded for imprecision</I> - <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>.</P>

<P>Current evidence suggests no clear difference in the proportion of venous ulcers healed at any time-point nor for the hazard of healing, when high-frequency ultrasound was compared with no ultrasound. There are few comparative data available at most of the follow-up time points, especially for the short-term periods. The majority of trials included were small, reported very limited outcome data and were at an unclear or high risk of bias. Only one study (newly included in this 2016 update) was conducted well methodologically and contributed usefully to this review. One small, poor quality study reported a greater mean reduction in ulcer size at four weeks in the ultrasound group compared with the control group.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-05-02 15:24:19 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gill Rizzello">
<P>This review has identified, appraised and presented all available randomised controlled trial (RCT) evidence regarding the clinical effectiveness of ultrasound in the treatment of venous leg ulcers. The review includes 11 relevant studies with a total of 969 participants. Overall the evidence was limited: most included studies were small and therefore statistically underpowered to detect treatment differences, had they existed.</P>
<P>The addition of a large, multicentre trial (<LINK REF="STD-Watson-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Watson 2011</LINK>) of high-frequency, therapeutic ultrasound to this review update has made no appreciable difference to the conclusions of this review; we remain uncertain as to whether high-frequency therapeutic ultrasound affects the healing rate of venous leg ulcers. The addition of a 337 participant trial, <LINK REF="STD-Watson-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Watson 2011</LINK>, to a review which hitherto contained data from only 467 randomised participants greatly increased the power of this review update. Furthermore, while most of the previous evidence came from trials that were deemed to be at high risk of bias, we assessed the newly added <LINK REF="STD-Watson-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Watson 2011</LINK> study as being at low risk of bias for all domains except blinding of participants and personnel (where it was deemed to be at high risk). Thus the addition of <LINK REF="STD-Watson-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Watson 2011</LINK> represents the inclusion of a large amount of high-quality data for which we have greater confidence than that from the previous studies.</P>
<P>The primary outcome for this review was complete wound healing. Though nine of the 11 included studies reported this outcome, they did so at different time-points. There was no clear evidence of a difference in the number of ulcers healed between the ultrasound and non-ultrasound groups. Most included studies were small and underpowered, and our GRADE assessment classed the estimates from this evidence as being mainly of low quality. Only at 12 weeks, there was moderate quality evidence (due to <LINK REF="STD-Watson-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Watson 2011</LINK>) showing that it was uncertain whether high frequency ultrasound affects healing.</P>
<P>Another primary outcome, change in wound size (adjusted for baseline size), was reported by two studies - both reported percentage reduction in area compared with baseline (<LINK REF="STD-Franek-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Franek 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Taradaj-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Taradaj 2007</LINK>). Only one study reported a greater reduction in ulcer area with ultrasound than without (<LINK REF="STD-Franek-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Franek 2006</LINK>), however this study was at unclear risk of bias.</P>
<P>In terms of secondary outcomes, only one trial, <LINK REF="STD-Watson-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Watson 2011</LINK>, measured and reported health-related quality of life and found no association with treatment. The same trial found significantly more adverse events in the ultrasound arm than in the standard care arm, though most of these were non-serious. It also reported the outcome of cost, and showed no significant difference between the two arms.</P>
<P>In summary, it is unclear whether therapeutic ultrasound increases the healing of venous leg ulcers and any effect is likely to be very small.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2017-03-02 09:28:16 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There are significant weaknesses in the completeness and applicability of the evidence overall. The trials were clinically heterogeneous with differences in duration of follow-up (ranging from three weeks, through four weeks, seven weeks, eight weeks, and 12 weeks to 12 months). Four of the 11 studies were conducted by a single research team in Poland (<LINK REF="STD-Franek-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Franek 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Franek-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Franek 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Taradaj-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Taradaj 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Taradaj-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Taradaj 2008</LINK>), and two of these studies were not included in meta-analysis due to the lack of complete healing data in the original published trial reports.</P>
<P>Only one study reported costs, adverse events and quality of life via reliable methodologies (<LINK REF="STD-Watson-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Watson 2011</LINK>). Clearly any impact of treatments on patients' quality of life is invaluable information for all decision makers - particularly patients. The relative cost-effectiveness of ultrasound treatment is essential information for healthcare founders and providers. We therefore urge that future research in this field uses reliable methodologies to measure these outcomes.</P>
<P>There is relatively little replication of studies, with single, small studies for most comparisons. This weak evidence base makes it impossible to draw conclusions with confidence.<BR/>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Limitations of design and implementation</HEADING>
<P>RCTs need to be adequately powered so that they are able to detect treatment effects of a specified size, should they exist. This means that sample size calculations should be used to help estimate the number of people who should be recruited to a trial. Additionally trials should have an adequate follow-up period to ensure enough time for important outcome events, such as complete wound healing, to occur. The trials included in this study were all small and their follow-up periods were generally short. This resulted in an evidence base with almost no complete healing data; generally the relevant outcome data that were reported were underpowered and imprecise, with wide confidence intervals.</P>
<P>Most studies included in this review were at a high or unclear risk of bias. In general, studies did not follow good practice for conduct and reporting guidelines, for example CONSORT (<A HREF="https://archie.cochrane.org/sections/documents/view?version=z1505181814419638392222501512018&amp;format=REVMAN#REF-Schulz-2010">Schulz 2010</A>). Key areas of good practice are the robust generation of a randomisation sequence, for example one that is computer-generated; robust allocation concealment, for example by use of a telephone randomisation service; and blinded outcome assessment where possible. All this information should be clearly stated in the study report, as all trial authors should anticipate the inclusion of their trials in systematic reviews. Additionally, studies should report clearly how they planned to collect adverse event data and how this process was standardised for both treatment arms. In terms of analysis, where possible, data from all participants should be included, that is, an intention-to-treat analysis should be conducted and measurements of variation such as the standard deviation or standard error should be presented around outcome measurements where appropriate. As far as is possible when conducting trials, steps should be taken to prevent missing data.</P>
<P>Where possible, studies should use validated scales to measure outcomes. The use of invalidated scales, including those that have been modified in an ad hoc way, can limit the value of the data collected, as it can be difficult to interpret and to synthesis across studies.</P>

<P>The review considered as much evidence as it was possible to obtain, including studies that were not published in English language journals. While there is a potential for publication bias, this is unlikely to be a problem for this review given the large number of negative findings that have been published.</P>

<P>Current evidence does not indicate a difference in the healing of venous leg ulcers when using or not using ultrasound. This finding is consistent with that of another systematic review of ultrasound on pressure ulcers (<LINK REF="REF-Akbari-Sari-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Akbari Sari 2006</LINK>), which also found uncertain evidence of benefit of ultrasound therapy.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2017-03-02 09:31:04 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is no clear evidence that therapeutic ultrasound increases the healing of venous leg ulcers and the existing evidence is of very low to moderate quality. This information needs to be interpreted with care, as only one study measured wound healing at 12 months, most studies had very short durations of follow-up. Furthermore, reporting of adverse events was poor across most included studies and only one study measured adverse events using accepted approaches.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2017-03-02 09:31:10 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We identified only one high quality randomised controlled trial (RCT) of therapeutic ultrasound for venous leg ulcers (<LINK REF="STD-Watson-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Watson 2011</LINK>), and few studies that measured the secondary outcomes of adverse events, pain, quality of life and cost. Any future trials of therapeutic ultrasound should measure and report these outcomes carefully alongside healing data.</P>
<P>Most of the RCTs included in this review had methodological and reporting problems. Future RCTs that evaluate ultrasound treatment should employ robust randomisation methods and concealment of allocation procedures to minimise bias. In addition, blinded outcome assessment and the intention-to-treat principle should be adopted, again, in order to minimise bias. Where participants have been lost to follow-up, appropriate and valid methods of imputation should be used and reported. These methodological aspects should be reported clearly, in line with the CONSORT (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials) guidelines (<A HREF="https://archie.cochrane.org/sections/documents/view?version=z1508190841336969172359015576326&amp;format=REVMAN#REF-Schulz-2010">Schulz 2010</A>). Length of time to healing should be measured and reported using appropriate survival analysis with adjustment for prognostic covariates such as ulcer area and duration. Future RCTs should be adequately powered in order to detect important treatment effects and sample size estimates should be transparent. Those planning future RCTs should consider the extent to which the recruited population is likely to represent patients seen in clinical practice, particularly with respect to mobility, ulcer size and duration, and the presence of ulcer infection.</P>
<P>Future research should carefully investigate the safety and adverse events associated with ultrasound use. Health-related quality of life assessment should be undertaken using a valid and reliable assessment instrument, with findings reported in full. As the ultrasound treatment for the management of venous leg ulcers may be guided by cost, those planning future RCTs should consider incorporation of meaningful cost-effectiveness information.</P>
<P>All trials should be registered with a trials register that meets the World Health Organization (WHO) criteria, and principal investigators should keep their contact details up to date on the register.</P>

<P>Quote for 12-week outcome: "The reference ulcer was the largest ulcer on either leg (as assessed at the time of trial entry). The date of healing was recorded by the research nurses on the Ulcer Healed Form and the photographs of the reference ulcer were assessed independently by two people blind to treatment group. Any disagreements were resolved by discussion or referral to a third blinded assessor. The primary outcome was calculated using the date of healing as decided by the blind assessors. If the blinded assessors did not agree on a healing date, then the date as recorded on the Ulcer Healed Form was used."</P>
<P>This blinded, remote adjudication of healing reduced the risk of detection bias. It is difficult to accurately judge the risk of bias in this scenario because an unmasked research nurse took a photograph. However, the blinded adjudication gives some reassurance that the risk of detection bias is low.</P>
<P>12-month outcome: unclear. Quote: "The number of leg ulcers that had completely healed by 12 months was based on nurse-reported data and not on blinded photographs ..."</P>

<P>For the original review, the Cochrane Wounds Specialised Register was searched for RCTs of therapeutic ultrasound up to December 1999. The reference lists of reviews and papers obtained from this search were scrutinised to identify additional studies.</P>
<P>For the 2011 update, review authors performed a search of the Cochrane Wounds Specialised Register (searched 01/07/11). Trials on the register are identified by hand searching of relevant journals, conference proceedings, and searching electronic databases. We carried out an additional search of the following electronic databases:</P>
<P>The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) - <I>The Cochrane Library</I> Issue 2, 2011<BR/>Ovid MEDLINE - 1950 to June Week 4 2011<BR/>Ovid EMBASE - 1980 to 2011 Week 25<BR/>EBSCO CINAHL - 1982 to 24 June 2011</P>
<P>Review authors searched The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) using the following strategy, which was adapted for other databases where appropriate:</P>
<P>#1 MeSH descriptor Varicose Ulcer explode all trees<BR/>#2 MeSH descriptor Leg Ulcer explode all trees<BR/>#3 (varicose NEXT ulcer*) or (venous NEXT ulcer*) or (leg NEXT ulcer*) or (foot NEXT ulcer*) or (stasis NEXT ulcer*)<BR/>#4 (#1 OR #2 OR #3)<BR/>#5 MeSH descriptor Ultrasonic Therapy explode all trees<BR/>#6 ultrasound NEAR/5 therap*<BR/>#7 ultrason* NEAR/5 therap*<BR/>#8 (#5 OR #6 OR #7)<BR/>#9 (#4 AND #8)</P>
<P>The MEDLINE search was combined with the Cochrane highly sensitive search strategy for identifying reports of randomised controlled trials (Higgins 2005). The EMBASE and CINAHL searches were combined with the trial filters developed by the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN).</P>
<P>We contacted researchers to obtain any unpublished data when needed. Reference lists of potentially useful articles were also searched. There was no restriction by language, date or publication status.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">1. Was the allocation sequence randomly generated?</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Low risk of bias</HEADING>
<P>The investigators describe a random component in the sequence generation process, such as referring to a random number table; using a computer random number generator; tossing a coin; shuffling cards or envelopes; throwing dice; drawing of lots.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">High risk of bias</HEADING>
<P>The investigators describe a non-random component in the sequence generation process. Usually, the description would involve some systematic, non-random approach, for example sequence generated by odd or even date of birth; sequence generated by some rule based on date (or day) of admission; sequence generated by some rule based on hospital or clinic record number.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Unclear risk of bias</HEADING>
<P>Insufficient information about the sequence generation process provided to permit judgement of low or high risk of bias.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">2. Was the treatment allocation adequately concealed?</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Low risk of bias</HEADING>
<P>Participants and investigators enrolling participants could not foresee assignment because one of the following, or an equivalent method, was used to conceal allocation: central allocation (including telephone, web-based and pharmacy-controlled randomisation); sequentially numbered drug containers of identical appearance; sequentially numbered, opaque, sealed envelopes.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">High risk of bias</HEADING>
<P>Participants or investigators enrolling participants could possibly foresee assignments and thus introduce selection bias, such as allocation based on using an open random allocation schedule (e.g. a list of random numbers); assignment envelopes without appropriate safeguards (e.g. envelopes were unsealed, non-opaque or not sequentially numbered); alternation or rotation; date of birth; case record number; any other explicitly unconcealed procedure.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Unclear risk of bias</HEADING>
<P>Insufficient information provided to permit judgement of low or high risk of bias. This is usually the case if the method of concealment is not described or is not described in sufficient detail to allow a definitive judgement, for example if the use of assignment envelopes is described, but it remains unclear whether envelopes were sequentially numbered, opaque and sealed.</P>

<P>Any one of the following:</P>
<UL>
<LI>No blinding, but the review authors judge that the outcome and the outcome measurement are not likely to be influenced by lack of blinding.</LI>
<LI>Blinding of participants and key study personnel ensured, and unlikely that the blinding could have been broken.</LI>

<LI>Reasons for missing outcome data unlikely to be related to true outcome (for survival data, censoring unlikely to be introducing bias).</LI>
<LI>Missing outcome data balanced in numbers across intervention groups, with similar reasons for missing data across groups.</LI>
<LI>For dichotomous outcome data, the proportion of missing outcomes compared with observed event risk is not enough to have a clinically relevant impact on the intervention effect estimate.</LI>

<LI>Missing data have been imputed using appropriate methods.</LI>

<UL>
<LI>Reason for missing outcome data likely to be related to true outcome, with imbalance in numbers or reasons for missing data across intervention groups.</LI>
<LI>For dichotomous outcome data, the proportion of missing outcomes compared with observed event risk is enough to induce clinically relevant bias in intervention effect estimate.</LI>
<LI>For continuous outcome data, plausible effect size (difference in means or standardised difference in means) among missing outcomes is enough to induce clinically relevant bias in observed effect size.</LI>
<LI>&#8216;As-treated&#8217; analysis done with substantial departure of the intervention received from that assigned at randomisation.</LI>

<LI>The study protocol is available and all of the study&#8217;s prespecified (primary and secondary) outcomes that are of interest in the review have been reported in the prespecified way.</LI>
<LI>The study protocol is not available but it is clear that the published reports include all expected outcomes, including those that were prespecified (convincing text of this nature may be uncommon).</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">High risk of bias</HEADING>
<P>Any one of the following:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Not all of the study&#8217;s prespecified primary outcomes have been reported.</LI>
<LI>One or more primary outcomes are reported using measurements, analysis methods or subsets of the data (e.g. subscales) that were not prespecified.</LI>
<LI>One or more reported primary outcomes were not prespecified (unless clear justification for their reporting is provided, such as an unexpected adverse effect).</LI>
<LI>One or more outcomes of interest in the review are reported incompletely so that they cannot be entered in a meta-analysis.</LI>
