<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2010-01-19 12:27:47 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>Surgical treatment of glaucoma is usually reserved for serious cases which cannot be controlled by other means such as topical medication or laser. Surgery can be performed in most types of glaucoma in order to reduce the pressure inside the eye which if left uncontrolled can irreversibly damage the optic nerve leading to loss of sight. There are a number of variants of drainage surgery but the most commonly performed procedure is trabeculectomy in which a guarded channel is fashioned through the wall of the eye under the upper lid and the fluid is allowed to collect under the conjunctiva (the membrane lining the eyeball) to form a drainage bleb. Scarring during the healing process can cause this channel to close and the operation to fail with a rise in pressure. Mitomycin C is a powerful agent which prevents scarring by inhibiting the multiplication of cells which produce scar tissue. This review asks whether there is evidence that its use during the initial stages of surgery to prevent the excessive conjunctival scarring reduces the risk of failure of the operation. Three types of patient were included: those at high risk of failure because of previous failed surgery or other complications, those having combined cataract and glaucoma surgery and those having primary trabeculectomy - an operation for the first time for their glaucoma. The review found evidence that Mitomycin C reduces the risk of surgical failure in both high risk and primary surgery but no evidence on combined cataract and glaucoma surgery. But the risk of adverse effects including an increased risk of cataracts (not in the combined group) was also noted. There were only a few studies on each category of patients and most were of only poor or moderate quality.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Trabeculectomy is performed as a treatment for glaucoma to lower the intraocular pressure (IOP). Mitomycin C (MMC) is an antimetabolite used during the initial stages of a trabeculectomy to prevent excessive postoperative scarring and thus reduce the risk of failure.</P>

<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To assess the effects of intraoperative MMC compared to placebo in trabeculectomy.</P>

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2010-01-20 10:09:30 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Group Trials Register) (<I>The Cochrane Library</I> Issue 4, 2009), MEDLINE (January 1966 to January 2010), EMBASE (January 1980 to January 2010), LILACS (Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature Database) (January 1982 to January 2010), OpenSIGLE (January 2010) and the UK Clinical Trials Gateway (UKCTG) (January 2010). We also wrote to investigators of trials included in the review to ask if they were aware of any other studies. There were no language or date restrictions in the search for trials.

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2010-01-18 11:36:43 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>Eleven trials, involving a total of 698 participants, were included. The trials enrolled three types of participants (high risk of failure, trabeculectomy combined with cataract surgery, no previous surgical intervention). Mitomycin C appears to reduce the relative risk of failure of trabeculectomy both in eyes at high risk of failure (relative risk 0.32, 95% confidence interval: 0.20 to 0.53) and those undergoing surgery for the first time (relative risk 0.29, 95% confidence interval 0.16 to 0.53). No significant effect on failure was noted in the group undergoing trabeculectomy combined with cataract extraction. Mean IOP was significantly reduced at 12 months in all three participant groups receiving MMC compared to placebo. No significant increase in permanent sight-threatening complications was detected. However, none of the trials were large enough or of sufficient duration to address the long-term risk of bleb infection and endophthalmitis which has been reported in observational studies. Some evidence exists that MMC increases the risk of cataract.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>Intraoperative MMC reduces the risk of surgical failure in eyes that have undergone no previous surgery and in eyes at high risk of failure. Compared to placebo it reduces mean IOP at 12 months in all groups of participants in this review. Apart from an increase in cataract formation following MMC, there was insufficient power to detect any increase in other serious side effects such as endophthalmitis.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2010-01-18 11:30:06 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Introduction</HEADING>
<P>Lowering intraocular pressure (IOP) was established as a treatment for glaucoma more than 100 years ago. For some time, there was a lack of good evidence that lowering IOP is effective in preventing continuing loss of visual function in glaucoma (<LINK REF="REF-Rossetti-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rossetti 1993</LINK>), but more recently, new trials have been completed which indicate lowering IOP reduces the risk of converting to POAG from Ocular Hypertension (<LINK REF="REF-OHTS-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">OHTS 2002</LINK>) and the risk of progression in early manifest disease (<LINK REF="REF-EMGT-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">EMGT 2002</LINK>). More recently still, a systematic review of the effectiveness of lowering IOP in glaucoma concludes that there is now better evidence to support this intervention (<LINK REF="REF-Maier-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maier 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>In terms of controlling IOP and preventing loss of visual field, a recent Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-Burr-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burr 2004</LINK>) comparing the effectiveness of surgery versus medicine for glaucoma found there was evidence of slightly better IOP control with surgery though no evidence of any difference in visual field progression. There was evidence of loss of some detailed vision in the short-term for those having surgery and some disbenefits in terms of ocular discomfort and vision related quality of life.</P>
<P>Glaucoma surgery of this kind is conducted under local or general anaesthesia often as a 'day-case' or outpatient procedure in western countries but practice varies widely according to local resources and access to follow-up care.</P>
<P>The trabeculectomy operation involves separating the conjunctiva from the sclera by making an incision at the junction of the cornea and the sclera (on the part of the eye normally hidden under the upper eyelid), to form a conjunctival flap that is folded back to expose the underlying sclera. A half-thickness incision is made in to the sclera (usually 4 x 4 mm) at the corneo-scleral junction. The half-thickness scleral flap is raised towards the limbus and a small section of the sclera under the flap is removed (sclerostomy) allowing aqueous to leave the anterior chamber of the eye. The scleral flap is repositioned and loosely sutured. The flap guards the sclerostomy, preventing excessive egress of aqueous that leads to hypotony (a very soft eye). Finally the conjunctiva is replaced. Aqueous passes through the sclera and collects under the conjunctiva as a bleb. Fluid in the bleb is absorbed by capillaries and lymphatics within the conjunctiva or evaporates across the conjunctiva. Final IOP is determined by many factors including the size of the bleb, the thickness of the conjunctiva and how adherent the conjunctiva around the bleb is to the sclera. If the conjunctiva overlying the operation site scars down onto the scleral flap then less aqueous can leave the eye, resulting in the return of raised IOP.</P>
<P>Various risk factors are thought to produce exaggerated postoperative wound healing, producing a hypercellular response in the subconjunctival tissues thereby restricting the flow of aqueous across the conjunctiva. Risk factors for postoperative failure include previous surgical interventions such as cataract surgery or previous glaucoma surgery and prolonged exposure to eye drops (<LINK REF="REF-Lavin-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lavin 1990</LINK>) especially sympathomimetics such as adrenaline. Age is inversely related to risk and being of black African ethnic origin is thought by some to be a risk factor (<LINK REF="REF-Broadway-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Broadway 1994</LINK>).</P>
<P>Antimetabolites, including Mitomycin C (MMC) and 5-Fluorouracil, were first used to modify the wound healing response in the early 1980s. Mitomycin C's alkylating properties inhibit DNA replication, which led to its use first as an anti-cancer drug. Much of the laboratory work on MMC's effectiveness followed a clinical report by Chen (<LINK REF="REF-Chen-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chen 1990</LINK>). At the concentrations used clinically MMC inhibits or kills the fibroblast cells involved in the scarring response (<LINK REF="REF-Khaw-1992b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Khaw 1992b</LINK>). It increases the success rate of filtration surgery in animal models of filtration surgery (<LINK REF="REF-Khaw-1992a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Khaw 1992a</LINK>). The main side effect from inhibiting wound healing is that the conjunctiva overlying the sclerostomy may become very thin. In the early postoperative period, flow of aqueous through the sclerostomy may be greater leading to hypotony. With longer follow-up holes can form in the conjunctiva that permit bacteria to enter the eye, triggering endophthalmitis. Finally it has been argued that MMC penetrates the sclera and has a direct toxic effect on the ciliary body and epithelium, possibly reducing the production of aqueous.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Rationale for a systematic review</HEADING>
<P>We have already reviewed the effect of postoperative subconjunctival 5-fluorouracil injections compared to control on trabeculectomy (<LINK REF="REF-Wormald-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wormald 2001</LINK>). There have been no systematic reviews undertaken to summarise the totality of evidence for MMC augmentation of trabeculectomy. A review of wound healing in glaucoma filtering surgery was written before Chen first used MMC (<LINK REF="REF-Skuta-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Skuta 1987</LINK>). A subsequent editorial in 1992 called for more randomised controlled trials on the use of antimetabolites in filtering surgery to answer important questions on who should and should not receive these agents (<LINK REF="REF-Parrish-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parrish 1992</LINK>). In reviewing combined glaucoma and cataract surgery in another editorial, Shields suggested that antimetabolites might be useful in improving the success of this procedure but again called for more evidence of effectiveness (<LINK REF="REF-Shields-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shields 1993</LINK>). A more recent editorial (<LINK REF="REF-Higginbotham-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higginbotham 1996</LINK>) raised valid concerns that the widespread use of antimetabolites in glaucoma surgery has the potential to do as much harm as good and urged caution. Chen's survey in the US and Japan reveals wide variation in practice reflecting the underlying uncertainty over the indications for antimetabolite usage (<LINK REF="REF-Chen-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chen 1997</LINK>).</P>

<P>The Initial electronic searches revealed more than 70 reports. We identified 11 RCTs that met the review inclusion criteria. One trial (<LINK REF="STD-Shin-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Shin 1996</LINK>) was excluded because it was unclear whether it included data from a similar trial the year before. Attempts made to contact the lead author were unsuccessful. Another trial (<LINK REF="STD-Chen-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Chen 2001</LINK>) was excluded because (a) although the mean follow up was 28 months, no results were expressed for one year and (b) because it was not possible to determine whether the high proportion of participants in the study with angle-closure glaucoma had any prior inflammatory or surgical events, thus preventing assessment of the participants' risk of failure.

<P>The update search in January 2010 retrieved 209 reports and one potentially relevant trial was found (<LINK REF="STD-Reibaldi-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Reibaldi 2008</LINK>). This is a report of long-term outcomes of the use of lower dose topical MMC in primary trabeculectomy compared to a smaller control group who received balanced salt solution. We have not yet been able to retrieve outcomes at one year but hope to receive these from the author (with whom we have been in touch) in due course. The Kaplan Meier survival curves printed in this report appear to show no differences in survival for at least the first 15 months of follow-up for any of the reported outcome measures; IOP less than 18 mmHg, IOP less than 14 mmHg and visual field progression.</P>

Although one study concerned the use of MMC in combined surgery, it was included in the high risk group because the patients had already undergone filtering surgery (<LINK REF="STD-Shin-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Shin 1998</LINK>). This study also included a primary glaucoma triple procedure group matched to the secondary group (having previously undergone trabeculectomy) for numerous characteristics and allocated to MMC or control on the basis of the matching. This group was therefore indirectly randomised and could theoretically be included in the combined procedure comparisons. However, we had no way of being sure whether these patients had been participants in the previously reported trial (<LINK REF="STD-Shin-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Shin 1995</LINK>).

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2010-01-19 14:10:54 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>The main finding is that while intraoperative Mitomycin C (MMC) is better than placebo in terms of lower one year failure rates in people at high risk of failure or undergoing primary surgery, there is no significant effect on those undergoing combined cataract extraction and trabeculectomy. This is despite the fact that MMC has a significantly greater IOP lowering effect than placebo across all three participant groups. In the combined trabeculectomy and cataract extraction studies the mean preoperative IOP ranges from 17.6 to 21.3 mmHg. In the primary trabeculectomy group the figure is 25.6 to 29.7 mmHg, and in the high risk group it is 20.8 to 40.3 mmHg with three of the four trials having a baseline IOP &gt; 30 mmHg (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>). Using an IOP threshold of 21 mmHg as an outcome measure, it is much less likely that failure will occur if participants enter the study with an IOP that labels them as a success. Much larger samples would be required to show an effect, if it is present.</P>
<P>The risk of cataract is the only side effect significantly increased by MMC, furthermore this effect is only seen in one trial. The failure to confirm many ophthalmologists' anecdotal evidence of increased complications such as hypotony and endophthalmitis is most likely due to:</P>
<UL>
<LI>low event rates;</LI>
</UL>
<P>Low event rates coupled with variations in diagnosis mean that very large numbers may be required to show a significant effect. Other descriptive work has suggested that MMC results in an incidence of endophthalmitis of one per cent per year (<LINK REF="REF-Greenfield-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Greenfield 1996</LINK>); our figures reveal a rate lower than this: only two cases of endophthalmitis were reported, both were in combined surgery participants receiving intraoperative MMC. With no cases occurring in the placebo group, even if this represents a real difference between treatment and control, the combined size of the trials is not enough to eliminate the possibility that the observed difference is due to chance. Risk of cataract formation was the only side effect shown to be significantly increased by MMC, it was also the side effect with highest event rate. Thus the combined trials were powerful enough to detect the effect of MMC.</P>
<UL>
<LI>increasing success in preventing complications;</LI>
</UL>
<P>As surgeons have recognised MMC's ability to produce wound leak and hypotony they have developed techniques to reduce them. Retrospective studies have quoted figures from 1.3% to 13% (<LINK REF="REF-Costa-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Costa 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Suner-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Suner 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zacharia-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zacharia 1993</LINK>). Meticulous care with conjunctival handling plus careful suturing of the conjunctiva and sclera has reduced the incidence of such complications (<LINK REF="REF-Suner-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Suner 1997</LINK>).</P>
<UL>
<LI>variable definitions.</LI>
</UL>
<P>Side effects such as wound leak can be hard to assess. Anterior chamber depth was not assessed using a pachymeter in any of these studies.</P>
<P>It remains essential to be vigilant about such complications even with low event rates. The outcome of endophthalmitis is poor, as is the long-term outcome from mitomycin hypotony. Only one of Costa's five patients with hypotony regained preoperative visual acuity after five months of follow-up (<LINK REF="REF-Costa-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Costa 1993</LINK>). A recent review of the experience of one centre using MMC in trabeculectomy for normal tension glaucoma found a dramatically increased incidence of late bleb leaks more than three months after the surgery (<LINK REF="REF-Membrey-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Membrey 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>Given that trabeculectomy is performed with the intention of preserving vision, any reduction in visual function due to cataract is detrimental. All intraocular surgery is recognised as potentially being cataractogenic. Trabeculectomy is no exception, involving intraocular inflammation, alteration of aqueous flow, changes in the blood eye barrier and prolonged exposure to topical steroids. Two glaucoma trials involving trabeculectomy have reported high rates of cataract. In the AGIS study 37.1% of white participants undergoing trabeculectomy developed cataract (<LINK REF="REF-AGIS-1998a" TYPE="REFERENCE">AGIS 1998a</LINK>), while in the Collaborative Normal-tension Glaucoma Study Group trial 38% of patients treated with filtration surgery developed lens opacities (<LINK REF="REF-CNTG-1998a" TYPE="REFERENCE">CNTG 1998a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-CNTG-1998b" TYPE="REFERENCE">CNTG 1998b</LINK>). In the latter study it was possible to detect a difference in visual field outcomes between treated and untreated patients only by censoring the data of those patients developing cataract (<LINK REF="REF-CNTG-1998b" TYPE="REFERENCE">CNTG 1998b</LINK>). Unfortunately the use of antimetabolites was not reported in these studies. However if, as suggested in this review, the use of intraoperative MMC produces an additional risk of cataract formation, then any field preserving effect achieved by MMC's additional IOP lowering may be offset by an increase in cataract formation.</P>
<P>A major problem when discussing the results is the high risk of bias in most studies, as determined using simple criteria. The failure of many trialists to respond to requests for more information means that all interpretation should continue to be performed with caution.</P>
<P>This systematic review has only been able to deal with the effect of MMC on failure, IOP and complications over one year. A patient with glaucoma may be followed for decades; both patient and ophthalmologist would benefit from information on the preservation of visual function. In none of the studies in this review was visual field preservation used as an outcome measure. Furthermore our analysis of failure at one year is hindered by the variable criteria used for this outcome (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>). The criteria employed include different threshold IOPs for failure and vary as to whether being on drops constitutes failure. We have reviewed data from the trials using variable criteria in a bid to be inclusive. However, permitting patients on drops to be considered successes will underestimate the size of MMC's effect. We have not presented a sub-analysis segregating trials with different failure criteria because of the heterogeneous nature of the data.</P>
<P>A notable omission from all the trials was any report of the participants' perception of their treatment, where they are exposed to potentially vision threatening risks of hypotony, cataract and endophthalmitis. It is also worth noting that the relative risk of failing following intraoperative MMC are similar to those obtained in the Cochrane systematic review of postoperative 5-Fluorouracil injections (<LINK REF="REF-Wormald-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wormald 2001</LINK>). However, the poor quality of the presented evidence means that any interpretation should be made with caution.</P>
<P>We have not analysed the variations in dose of MMC applied. The dose of MMC applied in the reviewed studies was varied by altering application time (one to five minutes) and concentration (0.1 to 0.5 mg/ml saline). It is known from work using radio labelled 5-Fluorouracil on animal cadaver eyes that peak conjunctival and scleral concentrations are reached within three minutes of application (<LINK REF="REF-Wilkins-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wilkins 2000</LINK>). What is not known is the effect of varying Mitomycin time and application on tissue levels and on efficacy. Two studies dealt with variable application times and concentrations of MMC (<LINK REF="STD-Robin-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Robin 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shin-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Shin 1998</LINK>) and neither was able to demonstrate a significant difference in risk of failure between the different treatment groups. <LINK REF="STD-Robin-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Robin 1997</LINK> did find a significantly increased risk of cataract in eyes treated with 0.2 mg/ml for four minutes compared to the other groups: control, 0.2 mg/ml for two minutes and 0.4 mg/ml for two minutes.</P>
<P>Publication bias is always a concern in a systematic review of this nature. Negative studies are less likely to be published and our results should be interpreted with this in mind. We have attempted to identify all trials that have been conducted but there is still a possibility that further trials have been conducted but not reported. We hope that readers of this review who are aware of relevant unpublished data will contact us through the available comments and criticism mechanism in <I>The Cochrane Library</I> so that the review can be modified accordingly.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2010-01-18 11:34:00 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>Intraoperative Mitomycin C appears to reduce the risk of surgical failure in eyes that have undergone no previous surgery and in eyes at high risk of failure. Compared to placebo it reduces mean IOP at 12 months in all groups of participants in this review. Apart from an increase in cataract formation following Mitomycin C use, no demonstrable significant increase in other side effects was detected. However, it is possible that low event rates and varying definitions would prevent the detection of a true increase in complications such as infection and hypotony. The quality of evidence supporting these conclusions is at best moderate and often low.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2010-01-18 11:34:07 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>Given the significant treatment effect shown in individual trials and in this systematic review, future trials involving patients at high risk and patients having a first trabeculectomy are unlikely to compare MMC with placebo. Any definitive report on the risk of side effects of using MMC would require a large number of patients to be randomised to either MMC or placebo. Thus the issue of risk and benefit from MMC is unlikely to be fully answered. Future trials are likely to compare MMC application to either intraoperative 5-Fluorouracil, postoperative 5-Fluorouracil or both, since they have come to represent the current minimum practice. However it is worth pointing out the evidence supporting this is not high quality.</P>
<P>The link between IOP and visual field preservation is assumed in the surgical studies reviewed here. Future studies will need to quantify MMC's effect in terms of visual fields. They will also need longer follow-up to ascertain whether the effect is sustained.</P>
<P>Future MMC trials involving combined procedures will need to modify the design of the trials included in this review; the low preoperative IOP in the existing combined studies militates against finding a significant outcome effect.</P>

<P>49 eyes of 49 patients who had previous filtration surgery undergoing cataract extraction and repeat trabeculectomy. 21 of these were randomised to MMC and 28 to no antimetabolite. These were labelled the Secondary Glaucoma Triple Procedure group (SGTP). Another group of patients "exactly" matched for age, race, gender, cup:disc ratio and systemic diseases (Diabetes Mellitus and Systemic Hypertension) was recruited for comparison in a case-control design to undergo primary trabeculectomy combined with cataract extraction and were allocated to MMC also on the basis of matching and allocation of the SGTP group. These were termed the Primary Glaucoma Triple Procedure group (PGTP). It is not clear whether these patients might have been participants in other reported trials such as <LINK REF="STD-Shin-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Shin 1995</LINK> or <LINK REF="STD-Shin-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Shin 1996</LINK>.</P>
