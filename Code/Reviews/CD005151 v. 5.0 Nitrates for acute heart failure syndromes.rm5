<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2013-07-18 12:03:58 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Heart failure occurs when the lower muscular heart chamber is unable to fill or eject blood normally due to heart disease of any origin. Acute heart failure syndromes (AHFS) are defined as gradual or rapid (over a period of less than 48 hours) deterioration in heart failure signs and symptoms resulting in a need for urgent therapy. There are many types of drugs and non-drug based interventions used for the treatment of AHFS. The aim of this review has been to determine the effectiveness and safety of nitrates (one drug group used for the treatment of AHFS) compared with alternative interventions in the treatment of patients with AHFS.</P>
<P>The four studies in this review included 634 patients with AHFS and employed two types of nitrates (isosorbide dinitrate and nitroglycerin). The studies compared nitrates with frusemide and morphine, frusemide alone, hydralazine, prenalterol, intravenous nesiritide and placebo. The study population in the trials was predominantly male (469/634 or 74% of all the patients included in the studies were male). The findings of this review indicate that there is no significant difference between nitrates and alternative treatment interventions for patients with AHFS in terms of healthcare outcomes. Nitrates appeared to be well tolerated in all four studies. Headaches is the most common side effect reported by patients. Headaches occurred more frequently when compared with nesiritide. There appeared to be no significant difference in the occurrence of symptomatic hypotension, pain, nausea and angina between patients administered nitroglycerin and nesiritide. The included studies did not report healthcare costs as an outcome measure.</P>
<P>The limitations of the review include the following: there were few studies eligible for inclusion (only four); the quality of the studies were relatively poor; the study participants were predominantly male; and all the eligible studies were conducted in developed Western countries. Consequently, the findings may not be generalisable to other healthcare settings and to females. The review also found no consistent evidence to support a difference in AHFS patients receiving nitrates or alternative interventions with regard to many of the healthcare outcome measures studied. Due to these limitations, the results of the review preclude definitive conclusions regarding the effectiveness and safety of nitrates compared with alternative interventions in the treatment of patients with AHFS.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2013-07-18 12:04:58 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Current drug therapy for acute heart failure syndromes (AHFS) consists mainly of diuretics supplemented by vasodilators or inotropes. Nitrates have been used as vasodilators in AHFS for many years and have been shown to improve some aspects of AHFS in some small studies. The aim of this review was to determine the clinical efficacy and safety of nitrate vasodilators in AHFS.</P>

<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2013-07-18 12:05:54 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>To quantify the effect of different nitrate preparations (isosorbide dinitrate and nitroglycerin) and the effect of route of administration of nitrates on clinical outcome, and to evaluate the safety and tolerability of nitrates in the management of AHFS.</P>

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2013-07-18 12:03:58 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (<I>The Cochrane Library </I>2011, Issue 3), MEDLINE (1950 to July week 2 2011) and EMBASE (1980 to week 28 2011). We searched the Current Controlled Trials MetaRegister of Clinical Trials (compiled by Current Science) (July 2011). We checked the reference lists of trials and contacted trial authors. We imposed no language restriction.</P>

<P>Randomised controlled trials comparing nitrates (isosorbide dinitrate and nitroglycerin) with alternative interventions (frusemide and morphine, frusemide alone, hydralazine, prenalterol, intravenous nesiritide and placebo) in the management of AHFS in adults aged 18 and over.</P>

<P>Two authors independently performed data extraction. Two authors performed trial quality assessment.

</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-07-18 12:07:11 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Four studies (634 participants) met the inclusion criteria. Two of the included studies included only patients with AHFS following acute myocardial infarction (AMI); one study excluded patients with overt AMI; and one study included participants with AHFS with and without acute coronary syndromes. </P>
<P>Based on a single study, there was no significant difference in the rapidity of symptom relief between intravenous nitroglycerin/N-acetylcysteine and intravenous frusemide/morphine after 30 minutes (fixed-effect MD -0.30, 95% CI -0.65 to 0.05), 60 minutes (fixed-effect MD -0.20, 95% CI -0.65 to 0.25), three hours (fixed-effect MD 0.20, 95% CI -0.27 to 0.67) and 24 hours (fixed-effect MD 0.00, 95% CI -0.31 to 0.31). There is no evidence to support a difference in AHFS patients receiving intravenous nitrate vasodilator therapy or alternative interventions with regard to the following outcome measures: requirement for mechanical ventilation, systolic blood pressure (SBP) change after three hours and 24 hours, diastolic blood pressure (DBP) change after 30, 60 and 90 minutes, heart rate change at 30 minutes, 60 minutes, three hours and 24 hours, pulmonary artery occlusion pressure (PAOP) change after three hours and 18 hours, cardiac output (CO) change at 90 minutes and three hours and progression to myocardial infarction. There is a significantly higher incidence of adverse events after three hours with nitroglycerin compared with placebo (odds ratio 2.29, 95% CI 1.26 to 4.16) based on a single study. There was no consistent evidence to support a difference in AHFS patients receiving intravenous nitrate vasodilator therapy or alternative interventions with regard to the following secondary outcome measures: SBP change after 30 and 60 minutes, heart rate change after 90 minutes, and PAOP change after 90 minutes. None of the included studies reported healthcare costs as an outcome measure. There were no data reported by any of the studies relating to the acceptability of the treatment to the patients (patient satisfaction scores). </P>
<P>Overall there was a paucity of relevant quality data in the included studies. Assessment of overall risk of bias in these studies was limited as three of the studies did not give sufficient detail to allow assessment of potential risk of bias.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2013-07-18 12:03:58 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There appears to be no significant difference between nitrate vasodilator therapy and alternative interventions in the treatment of AHFS, with regard to symptom relief and haemodynamic variables. Nitrates may be associated with a lower incidence of adverse effects after three hours compared with placebo. However, there is a lack of data to draw any firm conclusions concerning the use of nitrates in AHFS because current evidence is based on few low-quality studies.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2013-07-18 12:36:04 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Heart failure is a syndrome in which the patients should have the following features: symptoms of heart failure, typically shortness of breath at rest or during exertion, or fatigue (or both); signs of fluid retention such as pulmonary congestion or ankle swelling; and objective evidence of an abnormality of the structure or function of the heart at rest (<LINK REF="REF-McMurray-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">McMurray 2012</LINK>). Acute heart failure syndromes (AHFS) are defined as gradual or rapid deterioration in heart failure signs and symptoms resulting in a need for urgent therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Gheorghiade-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gheorghiade 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McMurray-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">McMurray 2012</LINK>). AHFS are complex and can result from any structural or functional cardiac disorder that impairs the ability of the ventricle to fill with or eject blood (<LINK REF="REF-Hunt-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hunt 2001</LINK>). For patients with pre-existing chronic heart failure the following may be responsible for the acute phase of decompensation (episodes of AHFS) of the underlying condition: myocardial ischaemia, lack of compliance to diet or medication regimen, uncontrolled hypertension, cardiac arrhythmia, systemic infection or anaemia (<LINK REF="REF-DiGuili-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">DiGuili 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fonarow-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fonarow 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McMurray-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">McMurray 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Weintraub-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weintraub 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Whellan-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Whellan 2013</LINK>).</P>
<P>Despite the fact that AHFS are one of the most common syndromes in emergency medicine, the exact pathogenesis has remained largely unknown. This is because the availability of haemodynamic data on which to base rational therapy in AHFS is limited by the difficulty in performing ethical clinical trials. However, the use of implantable device diagnostics is leading to a better understanding of the pathogenesis of AHFS (<LINK REF="REF-Adamson-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Adamson 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Whellan-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Whellan 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zile-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zile 2011</LINK>). For example, using an implantable haemodynamic monitor (HIM), it has recently been demonstrated that the product of the level to which estimated pulmonary artery diastolic (ePAD) pressure (P) is increased and the length of time (T) over which that pressure is increased (PxT) is the pressure-based haemodynamic factor most closely associated with transition to AHFS in heart failure patients (<LINK REF="REF-Zile-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zile 2011</LINK>). In the meantime, the fulminant presentation of AHFS, and rapid resolution with some traditional pharmacological agents, creates ethical barriers to justification of the need for clinical trials with new treatment modalities or 'non-treatment'. Nevertheless, several studies have aimed to better characterise the pathogenesis of AHFS. These studies demonstrate that AHFS results from a rapidly deteriorating cycle of events in which patients with reduced baseline systolic and diastolic reserve are faced with an acute increase in systemic vascular resistance and, hence, afterload (<LINK REF="REF-Cotter-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cotter 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sharon-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sharon 2000</LINK>). This causes an acute decompensated state, leading to decreased peripheral perfusion, neurohormonal activation, decreasing left ventricular function and increasing vascular resistance (<LINK REF="REF-Kaluski-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kaluski 2003</LINK>). The result of this vicious cycle is an increase in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure that is transmitted backwards to the pulmonary vasculature, causing an acute increase in pulmonary capillary pressure and the transudation of fluid from the intravascular compartment to the lung interstitium and alveoli; ultimately the syndrome of acute cardiogenic pulmonary oedema may result (<LINK REF="REF-Kaluski-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kaluski 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>The International Working Group on Acute Heart Failure Syndromes determined that AHFS encompassed at least three clinical distinct entities (<LINK REF="REF-Gheorghiade-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gheorghiade 2005</LINK>):</P>
<OL>
<LI>worsening chronic heart failure associated with reduced or preserved left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) (70% of all admissions);</LI>
<LI>de novo heart failure (e.g. after a large myocardial infarction; sudden increase in blood pressure superimposed on a noncompliant left ventricle) (25% of all admissions); and</LI>
<LI>advanced heart failure (i.e. refractory to therapy) with severe left ventricle systolic dysfunction, associated with a continually worsening low output state (5% of all admissions).</LI>
</OL>
<P>The two fundamental haemodynamic parameters relate to the presence or absence of elevated filling pressures (wet or dry) and perfusion that is adequate or critically limited (warm or cold). Over 90% of patients presenting with acute decompensated heart failure have clinical congestion (classified as being wet) and, if right heart catheterisation were performed, would show elevated pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (<LINK REF="REF-Nohria-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nohria 2002</LINK>). These patients may have adequate or reduced perfusion, with the majority showing elevation in systemic vascular resistance. Identification of congestion (elevated filling pressures) in acute decompensation of chronic heart failure relies heavily on the symptoms of dyspnoea and orthopnoea. Meanwhile, the most assessable indicator of perfusion is blood pressure and pulse pressure (<LINK REF="REF-Nohria-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nohria 2002</LINK>). The use of this haemodynamic classification system allows for more appropriate targeting therapy in patients presenting with acute heart failure. A minority (less than 1%) of patients present with cardiogenic shock (<LINK REF="REF-Cleland-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cleland 2003</LINK>). This is caused by a severe reduction in cardiac output which is not met by an adequate increase in peripheral vascular resistance leading to a significant decrease in blood pressure and end organ perfusion. Consequently, the management of cardiogenic shock is directed at improving cardiac performance (by optimising filling pressure, intra-aortic balloon pump and emergent revascularisation) (<LINK REF="REF-Cotter-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cotter 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hochman-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hochman 1999</LINK>). The other AHFS (pulmonary oedema, hypertensive crisis and exacerbated heart failure) are caused by a combination of progressive excessive vasoconstriction superimposed on reduced left ventricular functional reserve (<LINK REF="REF-Cotter-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cotter 2003</LINK>). The impaired cardiac power and extreme vasoconstriction induces a vicious cycle of afterload mismatch resulting in a dramatic reduction of cardiac output and elevated left ventricular end diastolic pressure, which is transferred backwards to the pulmonary capillaries yielding pulmonary oedema (<LINK REF="REF-Cotter-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cotter 2003</LINK>). Therefore, the emergency management of these AHFS should be based on the administration of potent, rapidly acting intravenous vasodilators.</P>
<P>Heart failure complicating myocardial infarction is associated with a three to four-fold increase in hospital mortality (<LINK REF="REF-Hellermann-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hellermann 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Spencer-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spencer 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Spencer-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spencer 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Steg-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Steg 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wu-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wu 2002</LINK>). Depending on study design, the incidence of heart failure after myocardial infarction varies greatly from 3% to 53% (<LINK REF="REF-Ambrosioni-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ambrosioni 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bueno-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bueno 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hellermann-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hellermann 2002</LINK>). Meanwhile, because of their haemodynamically beneficial effects, nitrates are recommended in heart failure (<LINK REF="REF-Hunt-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hunt 2001</LINK>) and acute coronary syndromes (<LINK REF="REF-Peacock-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Peacock 2004</LINK>), respectively. Intravenous nitrate vasodilators are well tolerated in acute myocardial infarction with clinically significant hypotension occurring in less than 4% of patients (<LINK REF="REF-GISSI_x002d_3-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">GISSI-3 1994</LINK>), but this responds to dose reduction and fluid replacement. However, two mega-trials have failed to demonstrate any mortality reduction attributable to nitrate use in acute coronary syndromes (<LINK REF="REF-GISSI_x002d_3-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">GISSI-3 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-ISIS_x002d_4-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">ISIS-4 1995</LINK>). The primary reason for the use of nitrates in acute coronary syndromes is for a beneficial haemodynamic effect and to decrease the pain of myocardial ischaemia (<LINK REF="REF-Peacock-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Peacock 2004</LINK>).</P>

<P>Nitrates (for example, nitroglycerin, isosorbide dinitrate and sodium nitroprusside) are established intravenous vasodilators in clinical practice and are recommended for moderate to severe volume overload in acute decompensated heart failure (<LINK REF="REF-DiDomenico-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">DiDomenico 2004</LINK>). At low doses they induce only venodilatation, but as the dose is gradually increased they cause the arteries, including the coronary arteries, to dilate (<LINK REF="REF-Imhof-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Imhof 1980</LINK>). They therefore cause balanced vasodilatation of the venous and arterial sides of the circulation, thereby reducing elevated left ventricular filling pressures and elevated systemic vascular resistance, without impairing tissue perfusion.</P>
<P>Nitrates can be administered sublingually, orally, transcutaneously and intravenously.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2013-07-18 12:03:58 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The main principles in the management of acute heart failure are symptom relief, reversal of acute haemodynamic abnormalities and a search for underlying precipitants of heart failure decompensation. Acute reduction in high left ventricular filling pressure with intravenous vasodilators corresponds most closely with symptomatic relief of dyspnoea at rest (<LINK REF="REF-Fonarow-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fonarow 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stevenson-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stevenson 1999</LINK>) and is the only significant haemodynamic predictor of subsequent mortality (<LINK REF="REF-Campana-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Campana 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lucas-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lucas 2000</LINK>). Thus using intravenous vasodilators to reverse acute heart failure decompensation is more physiologically rational in that it primarily targets elevated ventricular filling pressures and elevated systemic vascular resistance (<LINK REF="REF-Fonarow-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fonarow 2001</LINK>). In addition, intravenous vasodilators reduce myocardial oxygen consumption and are not associated with worsening of myocardial ischaemia or precipitation of ventricular arrhythmias (<LINK REF="REF-Fonarow-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fonarow 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nohria-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nohria 2002</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2013-08-01 07:36:49 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The use of nitrates for AHFS is a clinically valid topic for a Cochrane systematic review for many reasons.</P>
<P>Firstly, AHFS are very common. With a prevalence of 5,700,000 (2.4% of the entire populace) in 2008, and an estimated yearly incidence of 670,000, the burden of heart failure in the United States is tremendous (<LINK REF="REF-Roger-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roger 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>Secondly, AHFS are associated with significant morbidity, healthcare costs and societal economic burden. In the United States, the mortality rate stood at 56,565 in 2007 and 990,000 hospital discharges pertained to heart failure admissions (<LINK REF="REF-Roger-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roger 2011</LINK>). The EuroHeart Failure survey programme, one of the largest surveys of how patients hospitalised for heart failure are managed, reported 13% mortality during and after first hospitalisation for heart failure (<LINK REF="REF-Cleland-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cleland 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>AHFS are presently the leading cause of hospitalisation in persons over 60 years of age in developed countries (<LINK REF="REF-Cleland-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cleland 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cowie-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cowie 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hunt-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hunt 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Khand-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Khand 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stewart-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stewart 2001</LINK>). Patients with acute heart failure face a median six-day duration of hospitalisation and a rehospitalisation rate over the next six months as high as 50% (<LINK REF="REF-AHA-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">AHA 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fonarow-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fonarow 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hunt-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hunt 2001</LINK>). It is estimated that AHFS account for almost 2% of National Health Service (NHS) expenditure in the United Kingdom, with the predominant cost component being hospitalisation (<LINK REF="REF-Berry-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Berry 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stewart-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stewart 2002</LINK>). These findings are consistent with those of several other countries (<LINK REF="REF-Doughty-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Doughty 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Eriksson-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eriksson 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ghali-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ghali 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Reitsma-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reitsma 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rodriguez-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rodriguez 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>Emergency department visits and subsequent hospitalisations for acute heart failure constitute a major public health problem. In 2006, there were nearly 658,000 annual emergency department encounters primarily for acute heart failure in the United States (<LINK REF="REF-Schappert-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schappert 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>Ageing populations and improved post-infarction survival lead to a high number of older patients with heart failure in more developed countries (<LINK REF="REF-Cleland-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cleland 2001</LINK>). A British study predicts that the annual number of male and female hospital admissions associated with a principal diagnosis of heart failure will increase by 34% (from 5500 to 7500) and by 12% (from 7800 to 8500), respectively, by 2020 (<LINK REF="REF-Stewart-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stewart 2003</LINK>)</P>
<P>Thirdly, despite the demonstrable beneficial effects of intravenous nitrate vasodilators as first-line agents in the management of patients with acute heart failure, the most common therapy administered to these patients is intravenous loop diuretics, particularly frusemide (<LINK REF="STD-Nelson-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Nelson 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Verma-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Verma 1987</LINK>). In a United Kingdom emergency department study, the majority of patients with acute heart failure received frusemide, with less than 70% receiving nitrates (<LINK REF="REF-Crane-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Crane 2002</LINK>). Among patients in the Acute Decompensated Heart Failure National Registry (<LINK REF="REF-ADHERE-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">ADHERE 2003</LINK>) in the United States, 64% of acute heart failure patients received intravenous diuretic therapy alone and only 27% of all admitted patients received intravenous vasoactive therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Fonarow-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fonarow 2003</LINK>). A properly conducted quantitative systematic review may provide an objective evidence base for the role of nitrates in the management of patients with acute heart failure.</P>
<P>Fourthly, concerning the use of nitrates for AHFS, it is important to document any incidence of adverse effects, cost of treatment and acceptability to the patient in a systematic and scientifically valid way.</P>
<P>Furthermore, a Cochrane systematic review that is continuously updated as new evidence is published may lead to clinical practice guidelines which may improve the efficiency and quality of patient care. To date there has been no systematic review on this topic. This Cochrane review aims to synthesise current best evidence and will be continuously updated as relevant new trials regarding the role of nitrates in the management of AHFS are published.</P>

<P>We evaluated clinical heterogeneity (differences between studies in key characteristics of the participants, interventions, or outcome measures).

We performed meta-analyses using RevMan software (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-5.2" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 5.2</LINK>).

<P>For dichotomous (or binary) data, we described the results both as a relative measure (odds ratio (OR), risk ratio (RR) and relative risk reduction) and an absolute measure (risk difference (RD)). Relative measures (odds ratios and risk ratios) can be used to combine studies but absolute measures can be more informative than relative measures because they reflect the baseline risk as well as the change in risk with the intervention. Relative measures are used to combine studies but absolute measures (such as the risk difference) are particularly useful when considering trade-offs between likely benefits and likely harms of an intervention (<LINK REF="REF-Deeks-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deeks 2011</LINK>).</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2014-03-29 18:31:03 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review assessed the randomised controlled trial (RCT) evidence comparing the outcomes of nitrate vasodilator therapy and alternative interventions in the management of acute heart failure syndromes (AHFS).</P>
<P>Our review found no evidence to support a difference in the primary outcome measure, rapidity of symptom relief, between intravenous nitrate vasodilator therapy and alternative interventions. Specifically, only two studies reported the rapidity of symptom relief as an outcome measure. The two trials involved 69 and 285 participants, respectively. Both studies recruited both male and female participants (<LINK REF="STD-Beltrame-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Beltrame 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-VMAC-2002" TYPE="STUDY">VMAC 2002</LINK>), but only one study detailed the ethnicity of the trial participants (<LINK REF="STD-VMAC-2002" TYPE="STUDY">VMAC 2002</LINK>). Only the trial involving 69 patients presented numerical measures of rapidity of symptom relief; sufficient detail regarding this outcome measure was not provided by the study involving 285 patients because the results were presented graphically. It was not possible to pool the results of these two trials because the comparator interventions were different and the rapidity of symptom relief was measured and reported in different ways in the respective studies, and it was not possible to obtain the individual patient data from the trialists. The estimates yielded by the trial which reported numerical measures of rapidity of symptom relief may be imprecise due to the relatively small sample size.</P>
<P>This review found no evidence to support a difference in AHFS patients receiving intravenous nitrate vasodilator therapy or alternative interventions with regard to the following outcome measures: requirement for mechanical ventilation, systolic blood pressure (SBP) change after three hours and 24 hours, diastolic blood pressure (DBP) change after 30, 60 and 90 minutes, heart rate change at 30 minutes, 60 minutes, three hours and 24 hours, pulmonary artery occlusion pressure (PAOP) change after three hours and 18 hours, cardiac output change at 90 minutes and three hours, and progression to myocardial infarction. Regarding adverse events after three hours, our review found a higher incidence of adverse events with intravenous nitrate therapy compared with placebo and compared with nesiritide; however, both of these findings were based on one trial respectively, therefore the estimates yielded may be imprecise.</P>
<P>This review found no consistent evidence to support a difference in AHFS patients receiving intravenous nitrate vasodilator therapy or alternative interventions with regard to the following secondary outcome measures: SBP change after 30 and 60 minutes, heart rate change after 90 minutes, PAOP change after 90 minutes. The inconsistency in the evidence is due to the existence of RCT evidence both for and against a difference in AHFS patients receiving intravenous nitrate vasodilator therapy or alternative interventions.</P>
<P>Two of the four included studies in this review recruited only patients with AHFS following myocardial infarction (<LINK REF="STD-Nelson-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Nelson 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Verma-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Verma 1987</LINK>); these studies therefore had a different, and narrower, focus than that of this review. Three of the four included studies in this review enrolled inpatients with AHFS, bypassing the emergency department phase of management. Depending on the drug's pharmacodynamic properties, it is possible that a therapeutic window exists beyond which apparent efficacy is diminished (<LINK REF="REF-Weintraub-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weintraub 2010</LINK>). This may be particularly true for relief of dyspnoea, one of the key end points in AHFS management (<LINK REF="REF-Mebazaa-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mebazaa 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pang-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pang 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Weintraub-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weintraub 2010</LINK>). Furthermore, there is currently no consensus on reasonable end points in relation to AHFS management (<LINK REF="REF-Weintraub-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weintraub 2010</LINK>). These factors may contribute to the inconsistent evidence found by this review regarding many of the outcomes studied.</P>
<P>The eligible RCTs for this review do not have comparisons which permit us to address two of the a priori objectives of this review. First, based on the eligible RCTs for this review, it is not possible to determine the effect of route of administration of nitrates on clinical outcome in AHFS in adults, because all the studies which met the a priori inclusion criteria only employed the intravenous route for nitrate administration. Second, it also not possible to quantify validly the effect of different nitrate preparations on clinical outcome in AHFS in adults based on the eligible RCTs for this review.</P>
<P>We were unable to perform a valid sensitivity analysis as planned a priori because all the included RCTs in this review were randomised (there were no included quasi-randomised trials eligible for inclusion) and none of the included RCTs met the criteria of a good-quality study (one which meets all of the following criteria: adequate allocation concealment, blinding of outcome assessment and data analysis performed according to the intention-to-treat principle).</P>
<P>Regarding the a priori subgroup analysis, this review found that nitrates (isosorbide dinitrate) cause a significantly greater SBP reduction after 90 minutes compared with frusemide in patients with AHFS complicating acute myocardial infarction. However, it found no significant difference between nitrates (isosorbide dinitrate) and frusemide in terms of other haemodynamic parameters (DBP, heart rate, PAOP and cardiac output). The findings of the subgroup analysis are limited and imprecise because it is based on two small RCTs which did not report the primary outcome measure of this review and employed only one comparison (isosorbide dinitrate versus frusemide).</P>
<P>There is no previous non-Cochrane systematic review based on RCT evidence comparing outcomes of nitrate vasodilator therapy and alternative interventions in the management of AHFS. It is therefore not possible to contextualise the findings of this review in relation to evidence from an existing systematic review. Meanwhile, like all systematic reviews, the findings of our review are limited by the quality of existing studies (<LINK REF="REF-Khan-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Khan 1996</LINK>): the small number of studies, the relatively small sample sizes in the respective studies and the different comparator interventions employed. Only two included studies in this review shared the same comparator interventions. Additionally, three of the four included studies had a high or unclear risk of bias. In terms of observable statistical heterogeneity in the five pooled analysis on haemodynamic parameters, considerable heterogeneity is present in one haemodynamic parameter and moderate heterogeneity may be present in another haemodynamic parameter. Due to these limitations, the estimates yielded by the review are imprecise and firm conclusions cannot be drawn regarding the effects of the interventions.</P>
<P>The relatively low methodological quality of existing RCT evidence is probably due to the diverse pathophysiological precipitants (for example, acute coronary syndromes, arrhythmias, infection, poor compliance with drug therapy or dietary requirements) of AHFS and the heterogenous patient population presenting with AHFS. Small studies, but in multiple, tightly controlled, relatively homogeneous AHFS patient subgroups (to limit phenotypic variability), may have better internal and external validity (<LINK REF="REF-Pang-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pang 2010</LINK>).</P>

<P>Our review found no evidence to support a difference in the rapidity of symptom relief between intravenous nitrate vasodilator therapy and alternative interventions in patients with acute heart failure syndromes (AHFS). However, randomised controlled trial (RCT) evidence comparing clinical outcomes of nitrate vasodilator therapy and alternative interventions in the management of AHFS is limited and of relatively low methodological quality. The risk of bias in existing RCT evidence is therefore difficult to ascertain. The existing RCT evidence is derived from trials conducted in Western developed countries and they were mainly conducted in males; the evidence may not be generalisable in other healthcare settings or females.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2013-07-18 12:32:20 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>More adequately powered studies of high methodological quality are required to determine whether there is any difference in clinical outcomes between nitrate vasodilator therapy and alternative interventions in patients with AHFS. Due to the diverse pathophysiological processes seen in AHFS, future research should focus on conducting studies in relatively homogeneous AHFS patient subgroups to limit phenotypic variability.</P>
<P>Patients enrolled in inpatient acute heart failure studies are often enrolled after they have reached the inpatient unit some 12 to 24 hours after presentation. As most patients have symptom relief with either diuretic or nitroglycerin given in the emergency setting, enrolling patients in trials after they have received acute therapy is likely to be significantly confounded. Testing of new therapies for AHFS should include collaboration among emergency physicians and cardiologists to enrol participants early in the course of their exacerbation.</P>
<P>Currently, there are a lack of validated measures in the management of AHFS that assess long-term outcomes. It is therefore clear that future studies should employ appropriate end points that are based on the mechanism of action and the principles of AHFS management.</P>

<PRO_REV_DIFF MODIFIED="2013-07-18 12:03:58 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Since the publication of the protocol for this review, the term 'acute heart failure syndromes' has emerged, by international consensus, as the encompassing term for the disease entities of interest in this review. The title of this review has therefore been changed from 'acute heart failure' to 'acute heart failure syndromes', to be consistent with the new international consensus terminology.</P>
