<P>Substantive amendment</P>
<P>The previous review on absorbent products (Absorbent products for containing urinary and/or faecal incontinence in adults. Brazzelli M, Shirran E, Vale L) has been split into several reviews, of which this is one. The others include women with moderate to heavy incontinence, men with light urinary incontinence, and children with disabilities and incontinence. At the time of publication of this review (issue 2, 2007) these were in preparation.</P>

<SUMMARY>
<TITLE>Absorbent products for light urinary incontinence in women</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Bladder control problems are common in women and many wear absorbent pads to contain urine leakage and protect their clothes. There are four main designs of absorbent products used for light urinary incontinence (i.e. urine loss that can contained within a small absorbent pad): disposable insert pads, disposable menstrual pads, washable pants with an integral pad and washable inserts. This review found only one eligible clinical trial which compared different designs of these products and had been carried out in the last ten years. This trial included all the designs. There is evidence that for leakage prevention, overall acceptability and preference, disposable inserts are better than menstrual pads, which are better than washable pants with integral pad, which are better than washable inserts. There is no clear benefit for skin health using either washable or disposable designs. Most women preferred the disposable insert pad but some preferred the other cheaper designs or would find them acceptable in some situations. Allowing women to choose their preferred design of absorbent product (or combination of different designs for different circumstances) would be more cost-effective and provide better patient satisfaction than provision of disposable insert pads alone. </P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Incontinence is a common and embarrassing problem which has a profound effect on social and psychological well-being. Many people wear absorbent products to contain urine leakage and protect their clothes. It can be difficult to define light urinary incontinence because urine volumes, flow and frequency rates may vary substantially whilst still being considered 'light'. Light incontinence may encompass occasional (monthly) leaks of very small amounts (e.g. 1 g to 2 g) up to frequent leaks (several times per day) of larger amounts (e.g. 20 g to 50 g). A practical definition is urine loss that can be contained within a small absorbent pad (typically 50 g to 500 g; ISO 1996). </P>

<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>One study with 85 participants met the selection criteria. This trial studied all the absorbent product designs included in this review. Data were presented on all included outcomes. For preventing leakage, for preference and for overall acceptability disposable insert pads are better than disposable menstrual pads which are better than washable pants with integral pad which are better than washable insert pads. There is no strong evidence that either disposables or washables are better for skin health. The disposable insert is the most expensive design and there is no dominant design for cost-effectiveness. There is evidence that some women will prefer alternative designs which are all cheaper than disposable inserts.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>Although data were available from only one eligible trial the data were sufficiently robust to make recommendations for practice. Disposable insert pads are typically more effective than the other designs considered. However, because they are the most expensive, providing choice of designs (or combinations of designs for different circumstances) is likely to be cost-effective. </P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2009-05-12 10:49:20 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Urinary incontinence (UI) is a common symptom affecting women of all ages. It is a stigmatizing problem and has a profound impact on health, in particular on social and psychological well-being. It has been estimated that there are around three million people who are regularly incontinent in the UK (<LINK REF="REF-Turnberg-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Turnberg 1995</LINK>) although prevalence is difficult to assess due to differing definitions. Most studies of adult women that have used the most inclusive definitions of incontinence ('ever', 'any' or 'at least once in the last 12 months') have reported prevalence in the range of 25% to 45% (<LINK REF="REF-Hunskaar-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hunskaar 2005</LINK>). Around half of incontinent women report symptoms of stress UI, with mixed (stress and urge) incontinence occurring in around 35% of women and urge incontinence in the remainder (<LINK REF="REF-Hannestad-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hannestad 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>Despite advances in treatments and therapies for incontinence, complete cure is not possible for everyone and many women need to wear absorbent products to contain urine. Absorbent products help to avoid the distress of socially disabling leakage and odour problems and can enable women to carry out their everyday lives confidently. The costs of incontinence are very large. Recent US studies estimate the costs of incontinence to be between 16.5 and 19.5 billion dollars with around 9% of this cost being for 'routine care', which comprises the cost of absorbent products (<LINK REF="REF-Hu-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hu 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wilson-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wilson 2001</LINK>). In 1999 the NHS spent an estimated £82.5 million on absorbent products (<LINK REF="REF-Continence-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Continence 2000</LINK>), although the true cost is unknown as many people with incontinence choose to obtain their own products over the counter (<LINK REF="REF-Roe-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roe 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>Absorbent products may be classified into two broad categories based on user's severity of incontinence - light, and moderate to heavy incontinence. Within these categories of severity are disposable (single-use) and reusable (washable) products, which are further sub-divided into different bodyworn designs and different underpad designs, the latter being used mainly for moderate to heavy incontinence. Table 1 shows a classification of absorbent products (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>). Products for moderate to heavy incontinence are usually large and bulky, with large areas of absorbent material and high total absorbencies (typically 2000 to 3000g). Products for 'light' incontinence are much smaller, discreet products with total absorbencies often ranging from 50 g to 500g (<LINK REF="REF-ISO-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">ISO 1996</LINK>). There is a Cochrane review covering absorbent products for moderate to heavy incontinence (<LINK REF="REF-Fader-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fader 2008</LINK>), this review covers absorbent products for light urinary incontinence.</P>
<P>There are three purpose-made product designs for women with light incontinence: disposable insert pads and washable insert pads (both needing to be worn with close-fitting underwear) and washable pants with an integral pad (<LINK REF="REF-Continence-Directory" TYPE="REFERENCE">Continence Directory</LINK>). In addition, it is known that many women use menstrual pads instead of disposable insert pads because these are readily available in the shops, do not draw attention to incontinence status and are cheaper than purpose-made pads. Disposable inserts dominate the market but these are the most expensive products on a 'per use' basis. Washable products have comparatively high initial costs but have potential to be much cheaper over time so that a shift to the provision of washable products or the cheaper menstrual pads by consumers and health service providers may appear economically attractive. Currently, the UK National Health Service (NHS) purchases disposable insert pads and these are provided to women by some NHS Trusts, a minority also provide washable pants with an integral pad. Criteria for provision vary but tight budgets usually limit availability to women who are considered to have a significant problem, such as frequent incontinence occurring several times per week.</P>
<P>There are conflicting opinions regarding the selection of absorbent products for women with light incontinence and there is uncertainty about which designs are most cost-effective. This review aims to bring together the best available evidence to address these issues in a systematic way. However, there are important limitations when considering the results of clinical trials of continence products. The materials and designs of absorbent products are changed frequently by manufacturers, particularly those of disposable insert and menstrual pads. It is, therefore, unwise to compare the findings of clinical trials that differ by more than a few years. Absorbent products that purport to be the same also differ widely in absorbency, in other aspects of function and in their acceptability to patients (<LINK REF="STD-Clarke_x002d_O_x0027_Neill-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Clarke-O'Neill 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Clarke_x002d_O_x0027_Neill-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Clarke-O'Neill 2004</LINK>) and it is possible to compare particularly good or bad products in clinical trials. Findings from studies that have not included a range of products or demonstrated robust selection criteria for the products included in the trial should, therefore, be treated with caution.</P>
<P>Other Cochrane reviews are available covering other management and treatment options for urinary incontinence including voiding and toileting assistance programmes (<LINK REF="REF-Eustice-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eustice 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ostaszkiewicz-2004a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ostaszkiewicz 2004a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ostaszkiewicz-2004b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ostaszkiewicz 2004b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wallace-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wallace 2004</LINK>), physical therapies (<LINK REF="REF-Berghmans-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Berghmans 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Dumoulin-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dumoulin 2006</LINK>), catheters (<LINK REF="REF-Jamison-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jamison 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moore-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2007</LINK>); drugs (<LINK REF="REF-Alhasso-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alhasso 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nabi-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nabi 2006</LINK>), surgery (<LINK REF="REF-Keegan-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Keegan 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lapitan-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lapitan 2009</LINK>) as well as management of urinary incontinence after stroke (<LINK REF="REF-Thomas-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thomas 2008</LINK>) or post-prostatectomy surgery (<LINK REF="REF-Hunter-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hunter 2007</LINK>).</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Comparison 1: disposable insert pads versus disposable menstrual pads</HEADING>
<P>Data were available from the included study for all pre-specified outcomes (see comparisons 01.01 to 01.13). The disposable insert pad was significantly better than the menstrual pad for leakage performance (both diary data and participant rating), prevention of smell, comfort when wet, overall acceptability and preference. The menstrual pad was significantly better than the disposable insert for discreetness. There were no significant differerences between the designs for comfort when dry, staying in place, skin health problems and effect on everyday activities, although for the latter variable the confidence interval was wide and only just exceeded 1 (OR 0.28, 95% CI 0.07 to 1.10).</P>
<P>Cost data showed that there was significantly more laundry with the menstrual pad than with the disposable insert. The mean monthly cost of the disposable insert was nearly twice as much as the menstrual pads (£25.40 versus £13.70).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Comparison 2: disposable insert pads versus washable pads with integral pad</HEADING>
<P>Data were available from the included study for all pre-specified outcomes (see comparisons 02.01 to 02.13). The disposable insert pad was significantly better than the washable pants for leakage performance (both diary data and participant rating), prevention of smell, comfort when wet, skin health problems, effect on everyday activities, overall acceptability and preference. The washable pants with an integral pad were not significantly better than the disposable insert for any outcomes. There were no significant differences between the designs for discreetness, comfort when dry and staying in place.</P>
<P>Cost data showed that there was significantly more laundry with the washable pants with integral pad than with the disposable insert pads and this additional laundry was estimated to cost about £1.00 per month. The mean monthly cost of the disposable insert was three times as much as the washable pants with an integral pad (£25.40 versus £8.40)</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Comparison 3: disposable insert pads versus washable inserts</HEADING>
<P>Data were available from the included study for all pre-specified outcomes (see comparisons 03.01 to 03.13). The disposable insert pad was significantly better than the washable inserts for all outcomes except for discreetness, which was not significantly different between designs.</P>
<P>Cost data showed that there was significantly more laundry with the washable inserts than with the disposable insert pads and this additional laundry was estimated to cost about about £1.00 per month. The mean monthly cost of the disposable inserts was nearly ten times as much as the washable inserts (£25.40 versus £2.80).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Comparison 4: disposable menstrual pads versus washable pants with integral pad</HEADING>
<P>Data were available from the included study for all pre-specified outcomes (see comparison 04.01 to 04.13). The menstrual pad was significantly better than the washable pants with integral pad for leakage performance (both diary data and participant rating), prevention of smell, comfort when wet, effect on everyday activities, overall acceptability and preference. There were no significant differerences between the designs for discreetness, comfort when dry, staying in place and skin health problems.</P>
<P>Cost data showed that there was signficantly more laundry with the washable pants than with the menstrual pad and this additional laundry was estimated to cost about about £1.00 per month. The mean monthly cost of the menstrual pads was substantially more than for the washable pants with integral pad (£13.70 versus £8.40).</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>This review on absorbent products for women with light incontinence is limited because only one study was eligible for inclusion. Although there have been other clinical trials of absorbent products for women with light incontinence these have either been of several products within a design group (<LINK REF="STD-Clarke_x002d_O_x0027_Neill-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Clarke-O'Neill 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Clarke_x002d_O_x0027_Neill-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Clarke-O'Neill 2004</LINK>) or included experimentally engineered products (<LINK REF="STD-Thornburn-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Thornburn 1997</LINK>). A further study (<LINK REF="STD-Baker-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Baker 1996</LINK>) compared disposable insert pads to menstrual pads and concluded that menstrual pads performed similarly to disposable insert pads, but this study was excluded from the review because the products tested were those in use more than ten years ago and were likely to be different to those products currently available. </P>
<P>The single trial included in this review had a cross-over design and included all six of the product design comparisons selected. The study was of moderate size (N = 85) and the methodological quality was good. Method of randomising product order was stated and order effects were tested but not found to be significant. The problem of product representation was addressed by including three products, selected according to explicit criteria, to represent each design. The outcome variables used had been validated by interviews with participants (<LINK REF="REF-Getliffe-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Getliffe 2007</LINK>). A validated measure of quality of life would have strengthened the study but the authors concluded that no appropriate measure currently existed. By incorporating all four designs within one study, participants could compare and state preferences for all the designs (first choice for washable inserts: n = 1, washable pants: n = 13, disposable menstrual pads: n = 8, disposable insert pads: n = 63). The sample in the included study was of women with frequent (five or more times per week) urinary incontinence who were currently using a small absorbent pad (including menstrual pads). Women with less frequent incontinence (and possibly less severe incontinence) also use these designs of absorbent products and it is possible that findings with this population would be different. However, the included study examined leakage performance at different urine weights and found the same significant differences between the compared designs at 5 g urine weight as at higher weights (40 g), indicating that for leakage performance for 'lighter' incontinence the differences between the designs may be similar. </P>
<P>Inclusion of only one study did not allow for any combining of data for meta-analysis. Although our search was thorough it is possible that we may have missed some relevant studies. Although we did not employ language restrictions in our search, the number of non-English language references is under-represented in electronic databases, such as MEDLINE, and only published articles are included. Consequently there is a potential for language or publication bias, or both (<LINK REF="REF-Mulrow-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mulrow 1997</LINK>). </P>
<P>Cost-effectiveness was addressed in the included study. It was stated that the monthly costs of disposables were derived from the retail and mail-order prices prevailing at the time of the study (2004) and assumed a usage rate of four pads per 24 hours. For washable products it was assumed that a minimum stock of 12 products was necessary and that they would be replaced after 120 washes. Purchase of one new washable product per month would maintain stocks and the monthly cost of washable products was taken to be the cost of one item. This showed that there was no dominant design (that is one that is cheaper and better than others). Disposable inserts (the most expensive and most successful design) had the highest unit of cost per unit of effectiveness. On average, washable products were found to be better value for money but had high levels of unacceptability (over 80% for washable inserts, and over 50% for washable pants). Including laundry costs associated with washable products would reduce their cost-effectiveness relative to disposables. It was estimated that the maximum monthly cost of laundering associated washables is £1.00, giving revised average costs per unit of effectiveness of 22p (washable pants) and 20p (washable inserts).</P>
<P>The environmental impact of using washable versus disposable absorbent products is an issue of increasing importance and has recently been examined in relation to babies' nappies (<LINK REF="REF-Environment-Agency" TYPE="REFERENCE">Environment Agency</LINK>). That report concluded that there was no significant difference in environmental impact between washable and disposable nappy systems, although the types of impacts did vary. </P>
<P>Although the data from this review come from one study only, the findings show substantial and significant differences (with small to moderate confidence intervals) between the different designs of absorbent products for women with light incontinence. For overall acceptability, preference and for leakage performance, disposable insert pads are better than disposable menstrual pads, which are better than washable pants with integral pad, which are better than washable insert pads. The main drawback of the disposable insert is discreetness (particularly compared to the menstrual pad) and cost. There is no clear benefit for skin health using either washable or disposable designs. Washable inserts are particularly poor for staying in place when worn with patients' own close-fitting pants. Laundry is increased for all designs compared to the disposable insert pad, but the differences are most substantial for the washable designs.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>Disposable insert pads are best for leakage prevention, and are the most acceptable and preferred design, and should, therefore, be the mainstay of product provision to women with light urinary incontinence. But a policy of providing only disposable inserts is not the most cost-effective strategy. Washable designs have poor leakage performance and low acceptability compared to disposable designs (particularly inserts) and a policy of providing washable products alone is not recommended. Some women would prefer the alternative cheaper designs or would find them acceptable in certain situations. Enabling women to choose their absorbent product designs (or combinations of designs for different circumstances), within a pre-determined budget, would increase cost-effectiveness and patient satisfaction.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Only one clinical trial was included in this review and more well-designed trials would strengthen the findings. New variants on existing designs are frequently produced and occasionally new designs are developed. Accordingly it is important that future clinical trials are carried out to evaluate these developments. </P>
<P>Translational research to pilot the feasibility of providing a range of designs and enabling women to chose combinations of designs within a limited budget is needed.</P>
<P>This review has highlighted the comparative weakness of washable designs for light incontinence and further development of washable designs, in particular to improve leakage performance, would be of benefit. </P>
