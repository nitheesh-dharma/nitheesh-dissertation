<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2009-05-27 08:55:22 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>People who have coronary artery disease requiring coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery often have narrowing of other arteries. If the carotid artery, the artery carrying blood to the brain, is narrow (called carotid stenosis), this may increase the risk of stroke and other brain damage, complicating CABG surgery. Surgery to remove the carotid narrowing might prevent these complications of CABG surgery, but also has risks. We found no reliable evidence from randomised trials to indicate whether or not to perform preventive carotid surgery in patients who are going to have CABG surgery.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2009-06-03 14:06:45 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>Atherosclerosis is a generalised disease that has an effect on all the vessels to varying degrees. The major diseases are carotid stenosis and coronary artery disease, which can occur simultaneously (<LINK REF="REF-Mackey-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mackey 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ouriel-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ouriel 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>Different studies have reported various incidences for concomitant cerebrovascular disease and coronary atherosclerosis. The prevalence of carotid stenosis (greater than 50%) in patients with coronary artery disease has been reported to be as high as 22% (<LINK REF="REF-Schwartz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schwartz 1995</LINK>). The prevalence of severe carotid stenosis (greater than 75%) in similar patients varied from 1% to 12% in the literature (<LINK REF="REF-Evagelopoulos-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Evagelopoulos 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hines-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hines 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ricotta-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ricotta 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schwartz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schwartz 1995</LINK>). In a recently published study the prevalence of carotid stenosis in Japanese patients with multivessel coronary artery disease was 29.8% (<LINK REF="REF-Tanimoto-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tanimoto 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>Stroke and myocardial infarction are major complications following coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery, which can result in significant morbidity and mortality. In addition, both have been a critical complication following carotid endarterectomy (<LINK REF="REF-Huh-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Huh 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>The risk of stroke is estimated to be 1% to 2% in patients selected for CABG surgery (<LINK REF="REF-Blacker-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blacker 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Naylor-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Naylor 2002</LINK>) and 2.5% and 5% in patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy with asymptomatic and symptomatic carotid stenosis respectively (<LINK REF="REF-ACAS-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">ACAS 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NASCET-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">NASCET 2001</LINK>). Patients with a unilateral stenosis greater than 50% had a 3% risk of stroke after CABG surgery, rising to 5% for patients with bilateral stenosis greater than 50%, and 11% for those CABG patients with occlusion (<LINK REF="REF-Naylor-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Naylor 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>ACAS reported that 49% of perioperative deaths in patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy were due to cardiac causes, of which myocardial infarction was the main cause (<LINK REF="REF-ACAS-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">ACAS 1995</LINK>).</P>
<P>Perioperative complication rates for the combined procedure of simultaneous CABG surgery and carotid endarterectomy are unacceptably high, and have been reported as a 1.5% to 8.1% risk of death, and a risk of stroke of up to 6.3% (<LINK REF="REF-Dylewski-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dylewski 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gaudino-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gaudino 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Halpin-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Halpin 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hertzer-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hertzer 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Perler-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Perler 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ricotta-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ricotta 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rizzo-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rizzo 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Saha-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Saha 2000</LINK>). One meta-analysis reported the relative risk of stroke and death for patients undergoing the combined procedure as 1.50 and 1.55 respectively (<LINK REF="REF-Borger-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Borger 1999</LINK>). This high risk of neurological dysfunction after CABG surgery has led to much debate about the role of carotid surgery in such patients (<LINK REF="REF-Dylewski-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dylewski 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Huh-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Huh 2003</LINK>).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Symptomatic carotid stenosis</HEADING>
<P>A Cochrane Review has assessed the efficacy of carotid endarterectomy in adults with symptomatic carotid stenosis. It showed carotid endarterectomy reduces the risk of disabling stroke or death in patients with severe carotid stenosis, but only for surgically fit patients in hospitals with complication rates of less than 6%. The review authors found that, in patients with lesser degrees of stenosis, surgery increased the risk of complications by 20% (<LINK REF="REF-Cina-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cina 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>Another review assessed other characteristics that might have an effect on outcome. The authors analysed pooled data from the European Carotid Surgery Trial (<LINK REF="REF-ECST-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">ECST 1998</LINK>) and the North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial (<LINK REF="REF-NASCET-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">NASCET 2001</LINK>). They found three significant and clinically important subgroups and concluded that, in men and in the elderly, surgery could be beneficial. There was also a trend towards increased benefit in patients with a previous myocardial infarction (<LINK REF="REF-Rothwell-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rothwell 2004</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Asymptomatic carotid stenosis</HEADING>
<P>The management of asymptomatic carotid lesion is much more controversial. In order to determine the effects of carotid endarterectomy for patients with asymptomatic carotid stenosis, three trials with a total of 5223 patients were included in a Cochrane Review. Carotid endarterectomy reduced the overall risk of ipsilateral stroke and any stroke, although the overall net excess of operation-related perioperative stroke or death was 2.9%. Compared with trials of endarterectomy for symptomatic stenosis, lower operation-related stroke or death has been reported (<LINK REF="REF-ECST-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">ECST 1998</LINK> 7%; <LINK REF="REF-NASCET-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">NASCET 2001</LINK> 5.4%). It is consistent with the view that operative risk is less for asymptomatic carotid stenosis. This review did not find any statistically significant difference in treatment effect estimates among patients with different grades of stenosis (<LINK REF="REF-Chambers-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chambers 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>The Asymptomatic Carotid Stenosis Trial (<LINK REF="REF-ACST-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">ACST 2004</LINK>) suggested that immediate carotid endarterectomy halved the net five-year stroke risk from about 12% to about 6% (including 3% perioperative hazard). However, inappropriate selection of patients or poor surgery could obviate such benefits.</P>
<P>The Asymptomatic Carotid Atherosclerosis Study concluded that patients with asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis of 60% or more, who are good candidates for elective surgery, will have a reduced five-year risk of ipsilateral stroke if carotid endarterectomy is performed with less than 3% perioperative morbidity and mortality (<LINK REF="REF-ACAS-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">ACAS 1995</LINK>). Despite these data, a Cochrane Review reported that the absolute risk reduction is small: approximately 1% in each year over the first few years of follow up (<LINK REF="REF-Chambers-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chambers 2005</LINK>). The review authors concluded that, for most asymptomatic patients, a surgical operation to remove the stenosis has little benefit. They could not identify a threshold level of stenosis for selecting asymptomatic patients for surgery. Moreover, the applicability of surgical management for asymptomatic carotid stenosis to patients with concomitant carotid and coronary disease also remains controversial.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2009-06-03 14:11:52 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>Every year, thousands of people undergo CABG surgery all over the world. In many centres, but not all, it has become routine practice to perform carotid evaluation before this major surgery in order to assess the patency of carotid arteries. Some candidates for CABG surgery have significant symptomatic or asymptomatic carotid stenosis. In a non-emergency situation, the most important question for the surgeons is whether they should correct carotid stenosis; if so, should they do this before or after CABG surgery, or should they consider performing both procedures at the same time? The presence of carotid artery stenosis is a significant predictor of poor outcome in patients undergoing CABG surgery (<LINK REF="REF-Brener-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brener 1987</LINK>). Although carotid stenosis is found in about 8% of candidates for CABG surgery, optimal management is still controversial. We aimed to review all truly randomised controlled trials comparing endarterectomy and best medical therapy in patients scheduled for CABG surgery. Unfortunately, we could not find any studies that fitted our inclusion criteria. We believe that, since carotid stenosis worsens prognosis in CABG surgery, many surgeons aim to correct the stenosis before CABG surgery without reliable evidence that this will improve the prognosis.  A systematic review of outcomes in patients with staged carotid stenting and CABG surgery (<LINK REF="REF-Guzman-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guzman 2008</LINK>) demonstrated that the combined incidence of death and stroke in such patients remains high. They concluded that carotid stenosis is a marker of risk that might persist independently of its treatment. This may also be true for staged endarterectomy and CABG surgery. Another systematic review of outcomes following synchronous endarterectomy and CABG surgery demonstrated that these procedures are associated with an important cardiovascular risk (<LINK REF="REF-Naylor-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Naylor 2003</LINK>).</P>
