<P>
<B>Review question</B>
</P>
<P>This review of trials assessed the effects of barriers agents on pelvic pain, live birth and adhesion formation after pelvic surgery.</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>A common problem following surgery or infection is the occurrence of adhesions, where two normally separate surfaces stick together. Pelvic adhesions are commonly associated with infection, endometriosis or surgical trauma. During pelvic surgery, strategies to reduce pelvic adhesion formation include placing a synthetic physical barrier between the pelvic structures.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>We included 18 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of 1262 women undergoing gynaecological surgery. They assessed different types of barrier agents for preventing adhesions and compared them with each other or with no treatment. The data are current to February 2015. Twelve RCTs reported commercial funding; the other studies did not state their source of funding.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>We found no evidence on the effects of barrier agents used during pelvic surgery on either pain or fertility outcomes in women of reproductive age.</P>
<P>Low-quality evidence suggested that oxidised regenerated cellulose (Interceed), expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (Gore-Tex) and sodium hyaluronate with carboxymethylcellulose (Seprafilm) may all be more effective than no treatment in reducing the risk of adhesions following pelvic surgery. There was no conclusive evidence on the relative effectiveness of these interventions. There was no evidence that fibrin sheet was more effective than no treatment. No adverse events directly attributed to the adhesion agents were reported.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
</P>
<P>The quality of the evidence ranged from very low to moderate. The most common limitations were imprecision and poor reporting of study methods. Most studies were commercially funded, and publication bias could not be ruled out.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-04-09 16:42:31 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Eighteen RCTs (1262 women) were included. Six RCTs randomised women; the remainder randomised pelvic organs. Laparoscopy (eight RCTs) and laparotomy (10 RCTs) were the primary surgical techniques. Indications for surgery included myomectomy (six RCTs), ovarian surgery (five RCTs), pelvic adhesions (five RCTs), endometriosis (one RCT) and mixed (one RCT). The sole indication for surgery in three of the RCTs was infertility. Twelve RCTs reported commercial funding; the rest did not state their source of funding.</P>
<P>No studies reported either of our primary outcomes of pelvic pain and live birth.</P>
<P>
<I>Oxidised regenerated cellulose (Interceed) versus no treatment at laparoscopy or laparotomy (13 RCTs)</I>
</P>
<P>At second-look laparoscopy oxidised regenerated cellulose at laparoscopy was associated with reduced incidence of de novo adhesions (OR 0.50, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.83, three RCTs, 360 participants, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 75%, very low-quality evidence) and of re-formed adhesions (OR 0.17, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.41, three RCTs, 100 participants, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 36%, low quality evidence).</P>
<P>At second-look laparoscopy no evidence was found of any difference between the groups in the incidence of de novo adhesions after laparotomy (OR 0.72, 95% CI 0.42 to 1.25, one RCT, 271 participants, I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 41%, low-quality evidence). However, the incidence of re-formed adhesions was lower in the intervention group (OR 0.38, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.55, six RCTs, 554 participants, moderate-quality evidence).</P>
<P>
<I>Expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (Gore-Tex) versus no treatment at gynaecological surgery (one RCT) </I>
</P>
<P>The evidence suggested that at second-look laparoscopy expanded polytetrafluoroethylene was associated with a reduction in new adhesion formation (OR 0.17, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.94, one RCT, 42 participants, low-quality evidence).</P>
<P>
<I>Expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (Gore-Tex) versus oxidised regenerated cellulose (Interceed) at gynaecological surgery (two RCTs)</I>
</P>
<P>One RCT found no difference between the groups at second-look laparoscopy in the incidence of de novo adhesions (OR 0.93, 95% CI 0.26 to 3.41, 38 participants, very low-quality evidence). A second RCT suggested that the expanded polytetrafluoroethylene group had a lower adhesion score (out of 11) (MD -3.79, 95% CI -5.12 to -2.46, 62 participants, very low-quality evidence) and a lower risk of re-formed adhesions (OR 0.13, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.80, 23 participants, very low-quality evidence). This last finding was sensitive to choice of effect estimate and no longer suggested a difference between the groups when a risk ratio was calculated (RR 0.36, 95% CI 0.13 to 1.01).</P>
<P>
<I>Sodium hyaluronate and carboxymethylcellulose (Seprafilm) versus no treatment at gynaecological surgery (one RCT)</I>

<BODY MODIFIED="2015-04-23 11:22:37 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="Helen E Nagels">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2015-04-09 14:49:56 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2015-04-09 14:43:48 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Pelvic adhesions can form as the result of pelvic inflammation, endometriosis or surgical trauma. The incidence of pelvic adhesions at second-look laparoscopy in the initial few weeks after surgery has been reported to be between 50% and 100% (<LINK REF="REF-diZerega-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">diZerega 1994</LINK>). The consequences of adhesion formation include subfertility, development of chronic abdominal pain and dyspareunia (difficult or painful sexual intercourse) (<LINK REF="REF-SRS-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">SRS 2007</LINK>). A recent study demonstrated that in women with a known reason for small bowel obstruction, adhesions were the single most common cause (<LINK REF="REF-Ten-Broek-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ten Broek 2013</LINK>).</P>
<P>Cutting, surgical denudation, ischaemia, desiccation or abrasion can cause peritoneal trauma during surgery. The subsequent healing mechanism in the peritoneal cavity occurs through a combination of mesothelial regeneration and fibrosis, resulting in adhesion formation between damaged serosal surfaces (<LINK REF="REF-diZerega-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">diZerega 1990</LINK>).</P>
<P>Minimally invasive techniques such as laparoscopy reduce the risk of de novo (new) adhesion formation but do not eliminate it entirely. Studies included within this review therefore assessed both laparoscopy and laparotomy.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2015-04-09 14:48:53 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Several barrier agents with different characteristics are commercially available. Oxidised regenerated cellulose (Interceed) was the first tested synthetic mechanical barrier agent to cover traumatised peritoneum in the pelvis. It is applied over raw tissue surfaces at the last stage of surgery after haemostasis has been achieved, and is designed to form a gelatinous protective coat within eight hours of application. Following this, it is broken down into its monosaccharide constituents and is designed to be absorbed within two weeks. Concerns with the use of oxidised regenerated cellulose include migration and the need for meticulous haemostasis. Use of oxidised regenerated cellulose in the presence of bleeding may promote fibrin deposition at sites of incomplete haemostasis, resulting in adhesion formation rather than prevention.</P>
<P>Another commercially available barrier agent is expanded polytetrafluoroethylene surgical membrane (Gore-Tex). This inert and permanent barrier acts by preventing cellular growth. However, it must be sutured to remain in place, and this may increase the incidence of adhesions while prolonging operating time. Much debate is ongoing regarding the need to remove expanded polytetrafluoroethylene after peritoneal healing is complete. This debate stems from studies investigating expanded polytetrafluoroethylene in vascular and pericardial grafts, which found no significant long-term adverse effects when the barrier was not removed (<LINK REF="REF-Jacobs-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jacobs 1996</LINK>). In addition, a prospective multi-centre observational study investigating the long-term use of expanded polytetrafluoroethylene without removal reported only one case of postoperative infection, which did not require removal of the membrane (<LINK REF="REF-Hurst-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hurst 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>Other products include sodium hyaluronate with carboxymethylcellulose (Seprafilm), an adhesion barrier agent composed of chemically derived sodium hyaluronate and carboxymethylcellulose. It is designed to be absorbed from the peritoneal cavity within seven days and completely excreted from the body within 28 days (<LINK REF="STD-Diamond-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Diamond 1996</LINK>). Sodium hyaluronate with carboxymethylcellulose consists of chemically modified hyaluronic acid and carboxymethylcellulose. It separates denuded planes of tissue for up to seven days before it is absorbed. As with oxidised regenerated cellulose, migration is the cause of some concern; however no evidence suggests that its effectiveness is altered by the presence of blood. Although evidence for its use in gynaecological surgery is limited, sodium hyaluronate with carboxymethylcellulose has been widely studied in the context of colorectal surgery. Formation of adhesions and incidence of small bowel obstruction were reduced in five RCTs investigating its use in various colorectal and general surgical procedures (<LINK REF="REF-Ten-Broek-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ten Broek 2013</LINK>).</P>
<P>Fibrin sheet is a sheet-type fibrin sealant with a solid layer of human fibrinogen, thrombin and aprotinin coating the active surface of equine collagen stained with riboflavin (<LINK REF="STD-Mais-1995a" TYPE="STUDY">Mais 1995a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pellicno-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pellicno 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>Fluid and pharmacological methods used to prevent adhesion formation are investigated in another Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-Ahmad-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ahmad 2014</LINK>).<BR/>
</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2014-11-23 10:16:37 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Theoretically, inert physical materials that are able to prevent mechanical contact between serosal surfaces for longer than three days have the potential to be helpful in preventing adhesion formation. This would allow independent healing of each traumatised peritoneal surface. Some barrier agents (e.g. expanded polytetrafluoroethylene) need to be sutured into place, requiring extra operating time, especially during laparoscopic procedures.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2015-04-09 14:49:56 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review is concerned with the effectiveness of barrier agents placed in the peritoneal cavity for preventing adhesions and/or improving fertility. Pharmacological adjuncts are reviewed elsewhere. Women present with the secondary effects of adhesions, including dyspareunia, subfertility, bowel obstruction and chronic pelvic pain. These problems can greatly impact on quality of life and may necessitate further surgery. No clinical consensus or guidance is available regarding the most effective antiadhesion agent. Assessment of the evidence on effectiveness of barrier agents is therefore important.</P>

Two review authors (HO'F, GA) independently examined these full-text articles for compliance with inclusion criteria.

<P>Two review authors independently extracted data from eligible studies using a data extraction form that was designed and pilot tested by the review authors. Disagreements were resolved by discussion or by consultation with a third review author. Data extracted included study characteristics and outcome data.

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2015-04-09 14:58:26 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Each included trial was assessed for the following criteria using the Cochrane risk of bias assessment tool: sequence generation; allocation concealment; blinding of participants, personnel and outcome assessors; completeness of outcome data; selective outcome reporting; and other potential sources of bias (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). Conclusions were presented in the 'Risk of bias' table and were incorporated into the interpretation of review findings by means of sensitivity analyses. Two review authors (GA and HO'F) independently performed all assessments of the quality of clinical trials. All discrepancies were resolved by AW.</P>
<P>In view of the difficulty involved in detecting and correcting for publication bias and other reporting biases, the review authors aimed to minimise the potential impact by ensuring a comprehensive search for eligible studies and by remaining alert for duplication of data. If 10 or more studies were included in an analysis, a funnel plot was used to explore the possibility of small-study effects (a tendency for estimates of the intervention effect to suggest that it is more beneficial in smaller studies).</P>
<P>Care was taken to search for within-study reporting bias, as seen in trials failing to report obvious outcomes (e.g. pregnancy rate, major complications) or reporting them in insufficient detail.</P>

<P>Results of dichotomous variables were presented as Mantel-Haenszel odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), and results of continuous variables are presented as mean differences (MDs). </P>
<P>We reversed the direction of effects of individual studies, when required, to ensure consistency across trials. We treated ordinal data as continuous outcomes. We presented 95% confidence intervals for all outcomes. When data used to calculate ORs or MDs were not available, we planned to utilise the most detailed numerical data available, which might facilitate similar analyses of included studies. We compared the magnitude and direction of effects reported by studies versus how they are presented in the review, taking account of legitimate differences.</P>

<UNIT_OF_ANALYSIS MODIFIED="2014-11-24 10:14:12 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>For within-participant designs, 'effective sample sizes' were calculated to allow for statistical synthesis, that is, for a trial randomly assigning ovaries within each participant rather than randomly assigning participants, numbers were calculated to simulate as nearly as possible the odds ratio and the confidence interval as if the study design had randomly assigned participants, not ovaries. This was achieved as follows.</P>
<OL>
<LI>We calculated the odds ratio and the 95% CI for the matched design.</LI>
<LI>We constrained the control rate in the hypothetical parallel design to make it equal to that observed in the matched design.</LI>
<LI>We constrained group sizes for the parallel design to make them equal to each other.</LI>

<P>As a result of this type of reanalysis of data, studies with within-participant design that may have previously demonstrated significance may no longer do so.<BR/>
<BR/>Several studies of within-participant design comparing oxidised regenerated cellulose versus no treatment were presented and analysed wrongly as having a parallel design. We recognised that failure to account for pairing and failure to take account of doubling of the sample size by using ovaries instead of participants as the unit of randomisation may have yielded spurious results. For these studies, the least favourable outcome for oxidised regenerated cellulose that was compatible with the reported results was assumed. We attempted to obtain correct results tables from study authors but were unsuccessful.</P>

<B>Trial design and setting</B>
<BR/>Number of studies: We identified a total of 18 randomised controlled trials that met the inclusion criteria (1262 participants).<BR/>
<BR/>Multi-centre trials: Nine trials were multi-centre studies (<LINK REF="STD-Azziz-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Azziz 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Diamond-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Diamond 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Franklin-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Franklin 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Haney-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Haney 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Myomectomy-ASG-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Myomectomy ASG 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nordic-APSG-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Nordic APSG 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sekiba-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Sekiba 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Takeuchi-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Takeuchi 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tinelli-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Tinelli 2011</LINK>).<BR/>
<BR/>Design: In six parallel-group trials, the unit of randomisation was the participant (<LINK REF="STD-Diamond-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Diamond 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mais-1995a" TYPE="STUDY">Mais 1995a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mais-1995b" TYPE="STUDY">Mais 1995b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Takeuchi-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Takeuchi 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tinelli-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Tinelli 2011</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Wallweiner-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Wallweiner 1998</LINK>). The remainder were within-participant trials in which the unit of randomisation was the ovary, uterine sites or the pelvic sidewall. One study (<LINK REF="STD-Takeuchi-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Takeuchi 2005</LINK>) was a multi-arm trial comparing fibrin gel and a fibrin sheet versus control. Comparison of the fibrin sheet arm versus the control arm was included in this review.<BR/>

<P>Two studies were rated as high risk (<LINK REF="STD-Li-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Li 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nordic-APSG-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Nordic APSG 1995</LINK>), and the other 17 studies were rated as unclear risk. The Nordic study (<LINK REF="STD-Nordic-APSG-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Nordic APSG 1995</LINK>) reported larger numbers of participants randomly assigned in meeting abstracts before the study was fully published in a journal. The explanation for this discrepancy was that some participants who did not meet inclusion criteria were recruited and were not included in the final analysis (personal communication, <LINK REF="REF-Wiseman-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wiseman 1999</LINK>). In the United Kingdom, centres other than Sheffield (<LINK REF="STD-Li-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Li 1994</LINK>) were randomly assigning participants in a study of oxidised regenerated cellulose versus no treatment in the early 1990s (personal communication, A Watson), but the data have never been published. Attempts to identify these data by contacting the investigators and the sponsoring company (Ethicon, Bridgewater, New Jersey, USA) have proved fruitless thus far. In the study reported by <LINK REF="STD-van-Geldorp-1994" TYPE="STUDY">van Geldorp 1994</LINK>, another centre was recruiting participants (investigator: Trimbos-Kemper, Netherlands), but the results have been reported only briefly in a review (<LINK REF="REF-Wiseman-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wiseman 1999</LINK>). Data regarding the use of oxidised regenerated cellulose must be interpreted with caution because of the high risk of bias.</P>
<P>Additional information was sought from some study authors; at the time of this writing, six replies had been received (<LINK REF="STD-Azziz-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Azziz 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Franklin-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Franklin 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Keckstein-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Keckstein 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Myomectomy-ASG-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Myomectomy ASG 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Saravelos-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Saravelos 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-van-Geldorp-1994" TYPE="STUDY">van Geldorp 1994</LINK>).</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Haney-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Haney 1995</LINK> reported statistically significant reductions in the adhesion score, but it is not clear whether these analyses took account of the within-participant design. It should be noted that the incidence of adhesions in the oxidised regenerated cellulose arm of the trial is greater than would be expected from the RCTs of oxidised regenerated cellulose versus no barrier agent. As it was not clear from the publication whether the surgeon was unblinded at the time of the second-look laparoscopy, this result should be treated with some caution.</P>

<P>Use of oxidised regenerated cellulose was associated with a reduced incidence of adhesions when compared with no treatment at second-look laparoscopy in both de novo adhesions (OR 0.50, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.83, three trials, 360 participants, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 75%, very low quality) and re-formation adhesions (OR 0.16, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.41, three trials, 100 participants, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 36%, low quality).</P>
<P>No clear explanation was provided for the high heterogeneity in this analysis (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 75%). However, it is possible that the small number of participants within the included studies may partially account for it. Differences in operative procedure were observed between the studies, as were differences in wrapping and use of oxidised regenerated cellulose (<LINK REF="STD-Saravelos-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Saravelos 1996</LINK>).

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-04-09 15:21:01 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The review identified no studies that ireported our primary outcomes of pelvic pain and live birth rate.</P>
<P>There was evidence of a reduction in the incidence of re-formation adhesions with the use of oxidised regenerated cellulose at both laparoscopy (low-quality evidence) and laparotomy (moderate-quality evidence), along with a reduction in de novo adhesion formation at laparoscopy (very low-quality evidence).</P>
<P>One study demonstrated that use of expanded polytetrafluoroethylene was associated with a reduction in de novo adhesions at laparoscopy (low-quality evidence). A single, small-scale, unblinded, commercially funded study compared the use of expanded polytetrafluoroethylene versus oxidised regenerated cellulose and demonstrated a reduction in re-formation adhesions with expanded polytetrafluoroethylene in comparison with oxidised regenerated cellulose (very low-quality evidence).A study of similar size found no difference for de novo adhesions (very low-quality evidence).</P>
<P>A single study demonstrated a reduction in adhesion formation after laparoscopy with the use of sodium hyaluronate with carboxymethylcellulose (moderate-quality evidence).</P>
<P>A single small-scale study found no benefit for fibrin sheets for the incidence of adhesions (very low-quality evidence).</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2015-04-09 15:22:29 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Most gynaecological surgery is associated with a risk of pelvic adhesions. The clinical consequences of adhesions include pain, subfertility and small-bowel obstruction, as well as complications of subsequent surgery. Minimally invasive techniques such as laparoscopy reduce the risk of de novo adhesion formation but do not eliminate it entirely. Studies included within this review therefore assessed both laparoscopy and laparotomy.</P>
<P>This review assessed the effectiveness of barrier agents in reducing adhesions following conservative gynaecological surgery. As noted above, pharmacological and fluid agents are assessed in a separate Cochrane review.</P>
<P>Unfortunately, no studies in this review reported pregnancy or pelvic pain as a primary outcome but instead focused on extent of adhesion formation by incidence or by score. However, only five studies investigated the use of barrier agents in women seeking treatment to improve fertility. None of these studies reported adverse outcomes attributable to the use of a barrier agent.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2015-04-09 15:23:58 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The included studies were at unclear risk of bias in most domains. The most common limitation was failure to report sufficient details of study methods. Studies were at high risk of bias related to attrition rates (three studies), selective reporting (two studies) and lack of blinding (one study). Reporting of adverse effects was inadequate. We were unable to formally assess the risk of publication bias. However, we note that 12 studies reported sponsorship, 11 of which were sponsored by companies that manufactured adhesion agents. Furthermore, evidence suggests that unpublished data may exist regarding oxidised regenerated cellulose. Specifically, centres in the United Kingdom were known to be randomly assigning participants for a study in 1990 (personal communication, AW), although only results from Sheffield were identified by our search (<LINK REF="STD-Li-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Li 1994</LINK>). Evidence of duplicate publication of data may contribute to increasing the risk of publication bias (<LINK REF="STD-Haney-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Haney 1995</LINK>).</P>
<P>Clinical heterogeneity between studies was observed, with differences in surgical technique and variable timing of second-look laparoscopy ranging from 23 days to 2.5 years. Considerable statistical heterogeneity was observed in the comparison of oxidised regenerated cellulose versus no treatment at laparoscopy (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 75%), for which no clear explanation was provided.</P>
<P>The overall quality of the evidence was graded using GRADE methods. The quality ranged from very low to moderate but was low or very low for most comparisons. The main limitations were imprecision and poor reporting of study methods. See <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>, <LINK REF="SOF-02" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 2</LINK>, <LINK REF="SOF-03" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 3</LINK>, <LINK REF="SOF-04" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 4</LINK>, <LINK REF="SOF-05" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 5</LINK> and <LINK REF="SOF-06" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 6</LINK>.</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2015-04-09 15:25:46 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The review authors made every effort to identify all studies that should be considered for inclusion. Since the time of the previous review, necessary details required for inclusion in Cochrane reviews have increased substantially. Although all previously included studies were reassessed for bias, some information was required from the study authors themselves, and attempts were made to contact them.</P>
<P>Duplicate publication of data and existence of unreported data create a risk of bias. This is reflected in the GRADE rating of very low for oxidised regenerated cellulose versus no comparison at laparoscopy. This was often difficult to establish because the data were presented as abstracts at meetings (often by different study authors). For example, <LINK REF="STD-Haney-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Haney 1995</LINK> had four abstract publications, and <LINK REF="STD-Keckstein-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Keckstein 1996</LINK> had two abstract publications.</P>
</POTENTIAL_BIASES>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2015-04-09 15:29:02 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>A review published in 2010 (<LINK REF="REF-Pados-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pados 2010</LINK> ) concludes that the "evidence is not adequate for definite conclusions to be drawn, either in terms of efficacy or in terms of safety" with regards to antiadhesion agents in gynaecological surgery. This is consistent with the findings of this review, which has found very little evidence on clinically relevant endpoints. Furthermore, the generally low GRADE evidence quality ratings given to most of the outcomes in this review show how, on our assessment, considerable uncertainty remains regarding use of these agents for improving patient outcomes.</P>
<P>The guidelines of the Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada on use of adhesion agents in gynaecological surgery are consistent with the notion that evidence on the effects of barrier agents on long-term clinical outcomes such as chronic pelvic pain and infertility is insufficient (<LINK REF="REF-Robertson-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Robertson 2010</LINK>). These guidelines also state: "Oxidized regenerated cellulose (Interceed) adhesion barrier is associated with a reduced incidence of pelvic adhesion formation at both laparoscopy and laparotomy when complete haemostasis is achieved." This information is consistent with that reported in this review, which found that oxidised regenerated cellulose decreased the incidence of re-formation adhesions at both laparoscopy and laparotomy and decreased the incidence of de novo adhesions at laparotomy. However, this review determined that the quality of evidence obtained ranged from very low to moderate.</P>
<P>The guidelines of the Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada also state: "Polytetrafluoroethylene (Gore-Tex) barrier is more effective than no barrier or oxidized regenerated cellulose in preventing adhesion formation" (<LINK REF="REF-Robertson-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Robertson 2010</LINK>). This again is partially consistent with our conclusions, as we identified only one study that showed benefit with the use of expanded polytetrafluoroethylene versus no treatment. However, we rated the quality of the evidence as low. We also found one trial that showed superiority of expanded polytetrafluoroethylene over oxidised regenerated cellulose for the incidence of re-formation adhesions. We deemed this evidence to be of very low quality, as it was a very small, unblinded, privately funded study. Furthermore, no benefit was seen in a study of similar sized that compared use of these agents in de novo adhesions. This is consistent with the findings of <LINK REF="REF-Robertson-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Robertson 2010</LINK>, who counselled caution when interpreting the result.</P>
<P>Finally, <LINK REF="REF-Robertson-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Robertson 2010</LINK> state: "Chemically modified sodium hyaluronate/carboxymethylcellulose (Seprafilm) is effective in preventing adhesion formation, especially following myomectomies," although researchers warned that these results should be interpreted with caution on the basis of comments provided in the previous version of this review. Our updated review also agrees with this conclusion.</P>

<P>We found no evidence on the effects of barrier agents used during pelvic surgery on either pain or fertility outcomes in women of reproductive age.</P>
<P>Low quality evidence suggests that oxidised regenerated cellulose (Interceed), expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (Gore-Tex) and sodium hyaluronate with carboxymethylcellulose (Seprafilm) may all be more effective than no treatment in reducing the incidence of adhesion formation following pelvic surgery. There is no conclusive evidence on the relative effectiveness of these interventions. There is no evidence to suggest that fibrin sheet is more effective than no treatment. No adverse events directly attributed to the adhesion agents were reported. The quality of the evidence ranged from very low to moderate. The most common limitations were imprecision and poor reporting of study methods. Most studies were commercially funded, and publication bias could not be ruled out.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2014-11-23 14:01:07 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Further high-quality studies with improved blinding of surgeons/outcome assessment, reduced selective reporting and use of intention-to-treat analyses are required. Research should focus on the effects of barrier agents on clinical outcomes, with emphasis on fertility outcomes in women trying to conceive. Future studies should include women as the unit of randomisation, live birth and pain as primary outcomes and earlier second-look laparoscopy (within four to six weeks).</P>
