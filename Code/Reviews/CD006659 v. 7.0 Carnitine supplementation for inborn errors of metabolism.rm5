<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2009-02-18 09:23:55 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington">
<P>Inborn errors of metabolism are genetic disorders which have a wide range of symptoms. These often start at or soon after birth but may appear first at any time during adulthood. Affected individuals may need to deal with symptoms of the disease throughout their lifetime. Symptoms are often non-specific and may affect any organ. It can be difficult to diagnose an inborn error of metabolism. However, early detection is important and screening of infants for some disorders, such as phenylketonuria, is routine in several countries. It is recommended that carnitine supplements are prescribed in the diet of individuals with certain inborn errors of metabolism, along with other standard treatments. Carnitine supplements take the form of tablet, oral liquid, paediatric liquid and injection and might be taken with food for ease of administration. Unfortunately, we did not find any good quality trials to include in the review. This does not mean that carnitine is ineffective or should not be used in treating inborn errors of metabolism; however, individuals receiving carnitine should be carefully observed and monitored. Therefore, we recommend that clinicians base their decision to prescribe carnitine on clinical experience together with individual preferences. Future trials should include patient-reported outcomes using validated and internationally recognised scales. Any adverse events associated with the treatment should be reported. It should be carefully considered whether placebo-controlled trials in potentially lethal diseases, e.g. carnitine transporter disorder or glutaric aciduria type I, are ethical.</P>

<P>There are no published or ongoing randomised controlled clinical trials relevant to this review question. Therefore, in the absence of any high level evidence, clinicians should base their decisions on clinical experience and in conjunction with preferences of the individual where appropriate. This does not mean that carnitine is ineffective or should not be used in any inborn error of metabolism. However, given the lack of evidence both on the effectiveness and safety of carnitine and on the necessary dose and frequency to be prescribed, the current prescribing practice should continue to be observed and monitored with care until further evidence is available. Methodologically sound trials, reported according to the <A HREF="http://www.consortstatement.org/">Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) statement</A>, are required. It should be considered whether placebo-controlled trials in potentially lethal diseases, e.g. carnitine transporter disorder or glutaric aciduria type I, are ethical.<BR/>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2009-02-18 09:54:26 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington">
<P>Inborn errors of metabolism (IEMs) are genetic conditions caused by defects in enzymes or faulty transport proteins. They can lead to abnormalities in the synthesis and metabolism (biochemical procedures) of proteins, carbohydrates, or fats.</P>
<P>These disorders usually involve multiple organ systems; they can be life-threatening or may include intervals without apparent symptoms, but with slow and progressive degeneration in health over extended periods of time.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Aetiology and prevalence</HEADING>
<P>There are over 500 inherited biochemical disorders, which vary in age of onset, clinical severity, and often also mode of inheritance. A number of these are quite rare (1 in 500,000), whilst the most common disorders occur in 1 in 100 individuals (<LINK REF="REF-Winter-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Winter 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>Inborn errors of metabolism are mainly caused by the lack of a specific enzyme, or a transmembrane transporter, or similar protein; this results in a blockage of the metabolic pathway (biochemical procedure) with a consequent build up of toxic metabolites (<LINK REF="REF-Pollitt-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pollitt 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Seymour-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Seymour 1997</LINK>). Carnitine helps in the consumption and disposal of fat in the body and is an essential requirement in the delivery of long-chain fatty acids for the oxidation process which takes place in the mitochondria of the cell. Carnitine is also involved in the removal of toxic waste products of this oxidation process (<LINK REF="REF-Seymour-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Seymour 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>To limit the possibility of any serious permanent neurological damage in children, the early identification of high risk individuals is essential and should be followed by the provision of prompt and appropriate treatment aimed at metabolic stabilization (<LINK REF="REF-Leonard-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leonard 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pollitt-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pollitt 1997</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Diagnosis and symptoms</HEADING>
<P>Inborn errors of metabolism have unique biochemical phenotypes (patterns), which permit diagnoses by biochemical laboratory tests. However, and quite problematically, their clinical symptoms may often be indistinguishable from other infancy disorders and diseases (<LINK REF="REF-Lepage-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lepage 2006</LINK>) and may even vary quite markedly between individuals (<LINK REF="REF-Pollitt-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pollitt 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>Symptoms of IEMs can often be observed at or soon after birth, or there may have been indications (complications) during pregnancy. However, symptoms may also first appear at any time during life. Several disorders may be present at birth, such as early-onset seizures, severe hypotonia (low muscle tone), ascites (accumulation of fluid in the peritoneal cavity) or hydrops fetalis (severe swelling in the fetus and newborn), and dysmorphic syndromes (facial malformations). Even though many of the affected babies appear reasonably healthy at birth, deterioration can occur quite rapidly and may lead to coma and even death after a seemingly symptom-free period (<LINK REF="REF-Leonard-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leonard 2006</LINK>). As a result of this wide variation in presentation, the differential diagnosis of IEMs can be quite complex (<LINK REF="REF-Wilcken-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wilcken 2003</LINK>). Early detection of these metabolic abnormalities is paramount and screening of infants for some IEMs, such as phenylketonuria, is a routine procedure in a number of countries (<LINK REF="REF-Wilcken-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wilcken 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>A variety of tests may be required to make a definitive diagnosis, potentially involving a number of time-consuming and highly specialised metabolic investigations; therefore, some form of interim management may need to be instituted whilst awaiting test results.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Treatment options</HEADING>
<P>The severity of symptoms will generally dictate the management strategy of IEMs. Due to the national screening programs for IEMs in several countries, more individuals are being diagnosed, but unfortunately some of these disorders do not have useful treatment options and supportive care is indicated. They often require changes in diet which is dependant on the specific metabolic disease. However, the majority of small molecule disorders (defects of amino acid, organic acid and fatty acid metabolism) can be treated by a combination of firstly removing toxic metabolites using dialysis in an acute situation; secondly, reducing catabolism; and finally, by using diet to reduce the accumulation of toxic metabolites, restricting and substituting precursors (the primary component which enters a biochemical procedure) such as proteins, or specific carbohydrates or fatty acids (<LINK REF="REF-Leonard-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leonard 2006</LINK>). For some disorders, other therapies may be useful, of which one of these could be carnitine medication.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Carnitine</HEADING>
<P>Primary carnitine deficiency, due to mutations in the carnitine transporter, is a rare disorder, but secondary carnitine deficiency is a recognised secondary complication of several IEMs, especially the organic acidaemia and fatty acid oxidation defects. Carnitine is an amino acid derivative and has multiple physiological functions in several major metabolic pathways. It plays a critical role in the intermediary metabolism of fatty acids and the transport across mitochondrial membranes, and in the ultimate removal of their accumulated metabolites (<LINK REF="REF-Evangeliou-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Evangeliou 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>Even though it is estimated that only half of all IEMs can be treated biochemically, it has been proposed that carnitine supplementation should, under some circumstances, be provided to infants with a suspected metabolic disease as an interim measure, particularly whilst awaiting test results (<LINK REF="REF-Chakrapani-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chakrapani 2001</LINK>). The primary defect in many of these disorders of organic acid metabolism is enzymatic, meaning supplementation is unlikely to correct the enzyme abnormality; nevertheless, L-carnitine may still represent a useful therapeutic pathway specifically for the removal of accumulated toxic metabolites in IEMs.</P>
<P>A Cochrane Review did not find any evidence to support the routine supplementation of parenterally fed neonates with L-carnitine (<LINK REF="REF-Cairns-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cairns 2000</LINK>). However, L-carnitine has been used in the acute and long-term treatment of people with IEMs, such as disorders of organic acid and fatty acid metabolism, i.e. propionic acidaemia (PA); methylmalonic acidaemia (MMA); isovaleric acidaemia (IVA); and medium chain acyl-CoA (MCAD) deficiency. The drug was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the USA in 1992, and is generally considered to be a cheap, safe and apparently effective therapeutic measure for treating IEMs (<LINK REF="REF-Itoh-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Itoh 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Walter-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walter 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Winter-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Winter 2003</LINK>).</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2012-01-04 13:20:22 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington">
<P>Suitable trials were not found in the literature for our objectives to be achieved at present.</P>
<P>A number of studies tried to address the effectiveness and safety of carnitine supplementation for people with an IEM. A guideline on '<I>Diagnosis and management of glutaryl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (GDHD)' </I>partially addressed this question and states that lysine restricted diet and carnitine supplementation had a beneficial effect in people with GDHD. It can prevent secondary carnitine depletion, influences the progression of neurological disease and decreases the mortality rate in these patients. However, these results were only based on a multicenter cross-sectional study and a synthesis of a number of case reports of people with Glutaric acidemia type 1 and not on interventional trials (<LINK REF="REF-Kolker-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kolker 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kolker-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kolker 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bjugstad-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Bjugstad 2000</LINK>). The diverse nature of inborn errors of metabolism patients also raises questions on the applicability of results on the effectiveness of carnitine for one of the disorders to other individuals with different disorders. A possible solution could be grouping some of the disorders with similar characteristics e.g. long chain fatty acid oxidation defects in a clinical trial.<BR/>
<B>
<U>
<BR/>
</U>
</B>There is a large body of research exploring and discussing the role of carnitine in metabolic pathways and a limited number of observational and interventional studies examining the effectiveness of dietary interventions in people with an IEM. This was also obvious in a number of other Cochrane Reviews evaluating dietary interventions and nutrition supplements for people with phenylketonuria (<LINK REF="REF-Poustie-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Poustie 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Webster-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Webster 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Yi-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yi 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>For over 20 years carnitine has been used to treat fatty acid oxidation defects and organic acid disorders, and has provided moderate benefits in patients. Since then, carnitine has been added to the treatment of many IEMs based on those early clinical observations without any evidence from controlled clinical trials. Recently, a number of initiatives have led to improvements in research on IEMs (<LINK REF="REF-Kolker-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kolker 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Seymour-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Seymour 1997</LINK>) along with calls for more RCTs in these areas (<LINK REF="REF-Kruer--2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kruer 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Steiner-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Steiner 2005</LINK>). On the other hand, doubts have been raised on the safety of carnitine supplementation in some people with certain IEMs (e.g. people with long-chain 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (LCHAD)) (<LINK REF="REF-Winter-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Winter 1998</LINK>). Unfortunately, the effectiveness of these interventions has not been addressed by high quality RCTs, thus both the effectiveness and safety of carnitine in IEM remains an important question to be answered. The lack of RCTs undertaken in this area could be partially due to concerns raised on the ethical and practical aspects of undertaking a double-blind RCT and the variability in characteristics of people with different IEMs (<LINK REF="REF-Winter-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Winter 1998</LINK>). In this respect it would be important that future RCTs are robust, well-designed and reported according to the <A HREF="http://www.consortstatement.org/">CONSORT statement</A>.  Ethical issues should be carefully taken into consideration to decide whether it is possible to conduct placebo-controlled trials in potentially lethal diseases, e.g. carnitine transporter disorder or glutaric aciduria type I. For other IEMs, such as MCAD deficiency, in which some clinicians recommend the use of carnitine and others do not, we strongly recommend that RCTs are conducted as soon as possible.</P>

<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2012-01-04 13:20:22 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2012-01-04 13:20:22 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington">
<P>There are no published or ongoing randomised controlled clinical trials relevant to this review question. Therefore, in the absence of any high-level reliable evidence in the form of well-conducted RCTs, no firm conclusions can be made about the effectiveness of carnitine for IEMs. This does not mean that carnitine is ineffective or should not be used in treating IEMs. However, there is a lack of evidence on the effectiveness and safety of carnitine and the necessary dose and frequency of carnitine to be prescribed. Hence, current practice should continue to be observed and monitored with care until further evidence is available, preferably, in a controlled environment or in the context of a clinical trial. This could be an individual based N-of-1 RCT or a multi-center RCT. Similar to previous Cochrane Reviews on people with phenylketonuria (<LINK REF="REF-Poustie-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Poustie 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Webster-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Webster 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Yi-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yi 2008</LINK>), we recommend that people with an IEM should preferably enter larger, rather than smaller trials. Clinicians should base their treatment decisions on clinical experience and in conjunction with patient preference where appropriate. Moreover, clinicians should comprehensively inform patients on the advantages and disadvantages of carnitine in IEMs and existing uncertainties of its effectiveness and safety.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2009-02-18 10:47:23 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington">
<P>The results of this systematic review confirm the necessity for further methodologically sound trials that are reported according to the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (<A HREF="http://www.consortstatement.org/">CONSORT</A>) statement. Trialists should include patient-reported outcomes using validated and internationally recognised scales and ensure that any adverse events associated with the treatment are reported. Trialists should also involve the patients (or their carers) in trial design to ensure that important and relevant factors are considered. We have provided a research recommendation based on the EPICOT format (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>) (<LINK REF="REF-Brown-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brown 2006</LINK>). Careful consideration should be given when deciding whether it is ethical to conduct placebo-controlled trials in potentially lethal diseases, e.g. carnitine transporter disorder or glutaric aciduria type I. In other disorders, such as MCAD deficiency, where some clinicians recommend the use of carnitine and others do not, it is strongly recommended that RCTs are undertaken. Due to the low incidence of each type of IEM, we recommend that researchers consider grouping similar IEMs within international multi-center clinical trials.</P>
