<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2014-07-25 00:03:13 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<P>Acute pyelonephritis refers to infection of the kidneys and is the most severe form of urinary tract infection (UTI). Acute pyelonephritis causes high fever, vomiting, stomach pain, irritability and poor feeding in infants.</P>
<P>We wanted to find out if oral antibiotics were as effective as combined oral and injected antibiotics to treat children for kidney infection. This review updates our previous investigations published in 2003, 2005 and 2007. This review included evidence from 27 studies that involved 4452 children. The last literature search date was April 2014. This update included evidence from three new studies and from one study that was previously excluded.</P>
<P>Review results suggested that children aged over one month with acute pyelonephritis can be treated effectively with oral antibiotics (cefixime, ceftibuten or amoxicillin/clavulanic acid) or with short courses (two to four days) of intravenous (IV) therapy followed by oral therapy. If IV therapy with aminoglycosides is needed, single daily dosing is safe and effective.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2014-05-12 10:26:42 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Urinary tract infection (UTI) is one of the most common bacterial infections in infants. The most severe form of UTI is acute pyelonephritis, which results in significant acute morbidity and may cause permanent kidney damage. There remains uncertainty regarding the optimum antibiotic regimen, route of administration and duration of treatment. This is an update of a review that was first published in 2003 and updated in 2005 and 2007.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2014-07-08 18:08:12 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<P>To evaluate the benefits and harms of antibiotics used to treat children with acute pyelonephritis. The aspects of therapy considered were 1) different antibiotics, 2) different dosing regimens of the same antibiotic, 3) different duration of treatment, and 4) different routes of administration.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2014-07-25 00:02:14 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Renal Group's Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, reference lists of articles and conference proceedings without language restriction to 10 April 2014.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing different antibiotic agents, routes, frequencies or durations of therapy in children aged 0 to 18 years with proven UTI and acute pyelonephritis were selected. </P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2014-06-12 14:09:21 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Ann Jones">
<P>Four authors independently assessed study quality and extracted data. Statistical analyses were performed using the random-effects model and the results expressed as risk ratio (RR) for dichotomous outcomes or mean difference (MD) for continuous data with 95% confidence intervals (CI).</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-07-21 11:37:13 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This updated review included 27 studies (4452 children). This update included evidence from three new studies, and following re-evaluation, a previously excluded study was included because it now met our inclusion criteria.</P>
<P>Risk of bias was assessed as low for sequence generation (12 studies), allocation concealment (six studies), blinding of outcome assessors (17 studies), incomplete outcome reporting (19 studies) and selective outcome reporting (13 studies). No study was blinded for participants or investigators. The 27 included studies evaluated 12 different comparisons. No significant differences were found in duration of fever (2 studies, 808 children: MD 2.05 hours, 95% CI -0.84 to 4.94), persistent UTI at 72 hours after commencing therapy (2 studies, 542 children: RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.07 to 17.41) or persistent kidney damage at six to 12 months (4 studies, 943 children: RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.12) between oral antibiotic therapy (10 to 14 days) and intravenous (IV) therapy (3 days) followed by oral therapy (10 days). Similarly, no significant differences in persistent bacteriuria at the end of treatment (4 studies, 305 children: RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.24 to 2.55) or persistent kidney damage (4 studies, 726 children: RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.29) were found between IV therapy (three to four days) followed by oral therapy and IV therapy (seven to 14 days). No significant differences in efficacy were found between daily and thrice daily administration of aminoglycosides (1 study, 179 children, persistent clinical symptoms at three days: RR 1.98, 95% CI 0.37 to 10.53). Adverse events were mild and uncommon and rarely resulted in discontinuation of treatment.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2014-07-10 20:10:02 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<P>This updated review increases the body of evidence that oral antibiotics alone are as effective as a short course (three to four days) of IV antibiotics followed by oral therapy for a total treatment duration of 10 to 14 days for the treatment of acute pyelonephritis in children. When IV antibiotics are given, a short course (two to four days) of IV therapy followed by oral therapy is as effective as a longer course (seven to 10 days) of IV therapy. If IV therapy with aminoglycosides is chosen, single daily dosing is safe and effective. Insufficient data are available to extrapolate these findings to children aged less than one month of age or to children with dilating vesicoureteric reflux (grades III-V). Further studies are required to determine the optimal total duration of antibiotic therapy required for acute pyelonephritis.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2014-07-22 16:37:59 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<P>The urinary tract is a common site of bacterial infection in infants and young children. Pooled prevalence data demonstrate that approximately 7% of girls and boys are diagnosed with at least one urinary tract infection (UTI) by the age of 19 years (<LINK REF="REF-Shaikh-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shaikh 2008</LINK>). Girls are more susceptible to UTIs than boys after the first six months of life with a prevalence of 11% in girls and 4% in boys (<LINK REF="REF-Brkic-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brkic 2010</LINK>). UTI is defined by the presence of bacteria in urine (bacteriuria), which when cultured is measured in colony forming units/mL (CFU/mL) of uncentrifuged urine. The diagnosis of UTI in children is generally confirmed by the pure growth of a bacteria of greater than 10³ CFU/mL from a suprapubic aspirate, 10&#8308; CFU/mL from a bladder catheter specimen and 10&#8309; CFU/mL from non-invasive collection methods (clean catch and urinary bag specimens) (<LINK REF="REF-Bhat-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bhat 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>UTIs can be clinically grouped into asymptomatic bacteriuria, cystitis and acute pyelonephritis.</P>
<UL>
<LI>Asymptomatic bacteriuria is the presence of bacteriuria without clinical signs and symptoms.</LI>
<LI>Cystitis is a UTI limited to the urethra and bladder and is seen most commonly in girls over two years of age. It presents with localising symptoms of dysuria (pain when passing urine), frequency, urgency, cloudy urine and lower abdominal discomfort. Pyuria (white cells in the urine) and haematuria (blood in the urine) may also be found.</LI>
<LI>Acute pyelonephritis refers to infection of the kidneys, and is the most severe form of UTI in children. Clinically, this is associated with systemic features such as high fever, malaise, vomiting, abdominal and loin pain and tenderness, poor feeding and irritability in infants. Together with urine culture, diagnosis may be assisted by imaging using technetium 99m labelled dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) renal scan and markers of inflammation in the blood such as erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP).</LI>
<LI>Acute pyelonephritis is associated with significant short-term morbidity, including shock and septicaemia, especially in infants. Acute kidney parenchymal injury has been demonstrated on DMSA scan in about 60% of children shortly after UTI diagnosis (<LINK REF="REF-Shaikh-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shaikh 2010</LINK>). Permanent kidney damage may occur following acute pyelonephritis and is more frequent in children who have multiple episodes or who have vesicoureteric reflux (VUR) (<LINK REF="REF-Shaikh-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shaikh 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Smellie-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smellie 1985</LINK>). Serial DMSA scans of children after a first episode of acute pyelonephritis show that 15% of children with acute changes on DMSA scans have permanent kidney scarring at follow up (<LINK REF="REF-Shaikh-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shaikh 2010</LINK>). However, the long term significance of kidney damage following acute pyelonephritis is debatable. In children with previously normal kidneys, the amount of damage is small and unlikely to cause disease (<LINK REF="REF-Salo-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Salo 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Toffolo-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Toffolo 2012</LINK>).</LI>
</UL>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2014-05-12 09:52:26 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>A wide variety of antibiotic agents have been used to treat acute pyelonephritis in children. Antibiotics that have been used include aminoglycosides, cephalosporins, penicillins and trimethoprim/sulphamethoxazole (TMP/SMX). Historically, children who are judged by clinicians to be in poor general condition are given parenteral antibiotics and those who appear less sick have been given oral antibiotics, without clarity whether one route of administration is superior. An antibiotic course of seven to 14 days is generally recommended although the optimal duration of therapy is not known. Shorter courses may be associated with treatment failure while longer courses may unnecessarily expose children to the adverse effects of treatment. This review evaluated antibiotic therapies used to treat acute pyelonephritis, with consideration of different antibiotic agents, different dosing regimens of the same antibiotic, different durations of treatment and different routes of administration.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2014-06-12 14:18:16 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Ann Jones">
<P>Antibiotics work in the treatment of acute pyelonephritis by eliminating bacterial infection in the urinary tract. The purpose of antibiotic therapy is to eradicate and prevent progressive infection and its consequences, including shock and septicaemia, reduce acute kidney injury and resolve the acute clinical symptoms of infection. The efficacy of treatment depends on using the antibiotic(s) to which the bacteria is sensitive. While the results of antibiotic sensitivity testing are pending, initial treatment is chosen on an empiric basis to cover the most likely cause of infection.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2014-05-12 10:00:31 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Acute pyelonephritis is a common serious infection in children. Nonetheless, there remains no consensus on the most effective antibiotic regimen for the treatment of acute pyelonephritis. There is also uncertainty regarding the optimal route of administration of antibiotic therapy. Previously, most authorities recommended commencing antibiotic therapy by the parenteral route. The most recent guidelines however recommend initial treatment with oral antibiotics for children older than two months (<LINK REF="REF-AAP-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">AAP 2011</LINK>) or three months of age (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2007</LINK>) unless children are considered to be too unwell or unable to take oral antibiotics. This is advantageous because oral therapy is more convenient and does not require hospital admission, thereby reducing costs. There is further uncertainty about the optimal duration of antibiotic therapy. Currently, the recommended duration of therapy varies from seven to 14 days. </P>
<P>This review update was necessary to provide additional information about the optimum antibiotic regimens, route of administration and duration of treatment for acute pyelonephritis in children and about adverse effects of treatment.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-07-21 15:09:29 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review was designed to include all RCTs addressing all aspects of antibiotic treatment for children with acute pyelonephritis. Identified studies formed a heterogeneous group with few studies addressing the same or similar comparisons to enable assessment in meta-analyses. The 27 included studies addressed a variety of different questions related to the therapy of children with acute pyelonephritis.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Oral therapy versus IV therapy</HEADING>
<P>Four studies compared an oral antibiotic (ceftibuten, cefixime or amoxicillin/clavulanic acid) alone with IV therapy (cefotaxime or ceftriaxone) followed by oral therapy. These studies found:</P>
<UL>
<LI>No significant difference in bacteriological outcomes between groups.</LI>
<LI>The number of children with kidney parenchymal damage on DMSA scan at follow-up whether expressed as a proportion of the total number considered to have acute pyelonephritis or as a proportion of those with DMSA changes at entry did not differ significantly between groups.</LI>
</UL>
<P>Thus, there were no significant differences in efficacy between treatment with oral ceftibuten, cefixime and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid and IV therapy followed by oral therapy. Studies that support these findings enrolled children older than one month of age and hence the finding cannot be extrapolated to children aged less than one month.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Short duration versus long duration IV therapy</HEADING>
<P>A meta-analysis of six studies showed:</P>
<UL>
<LI>No significant differences in clinical or bacteriological outcomes between IV antibiotic therapy given for three to four days followed by oral therapy and IV therapy for seven to 14 days.</LI>
<LI>That the prevalence of kidney parenchymal injury on DMSA scan at three to six months after UTI therapy did not differ significantly between treatment groups.</LI>
</UL>
<P>These data show that short duration IV therapy (three to four days) can be used instead of longer courses of IV therapy to treat childhood acute pyelonephritis. The findings cannot be extrapolated to children less than one month of age as such children were excluded from the studies.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Single daily dosing with aminoglycosides</HEADING>
<P>If IV therapy is required, three studies provide data to support the safety and efficacy of daily dosing with aminoglycosides (gentamicin and netilmicin) compared with eight-hourly dosing in children with acute pyelonephritis. Once daily dosing has been studied extensively in adults and is preferred due to improved efficacy, similar or reduced toxicity, convenience and lower costs. These findings have also been supported in children justifying the use of single daily dosing of aminoglycosides (<LINK REF="REF-Contopoulos_x002d_Ioannidis-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Contopoulos-Ioannidis 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jenh-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jenh 2011</LINK>), although aminoglycoside pharmacokinetics and toxicity differ in children from adults.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Efficacy of different antibiotics</HEADING>
<P>The seven studies that compared different antibiotics did not demonstrate any advantage of one agent over another. Four studies compared a cephalosporin with amoxicillin/clavulanic acid or TMP/SMX. A meta-analysis of three studies demonstrated that children treated with oral ceftibuten had a higher clinical cure rate than TMP/SMX. However one large study (<LINK REF="STD-Marild-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Marild 2009</LINK>) contributed most of the weight of the analysis. The study defined clinical cure as the resolution of all symptoms related to the infection within 10 days. It is possible that there was some cross-over of symptoms related to the infection and those due to adverse effects of medication such as vomiting. Furthermore, the study did not demonstrate any difference in bacteriological elimination rates despite 15% of the pathogens responsible for the infection being resistant to TMP/SMX compared to 2% that were resistant to ceftibuten.</P>
<P>One study demonstrated that a single dose of parenteral medication added to oral therapy did not improve efficacy compared with oral therapy alone.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Adverse events</HEADING>
<P>Adverse events resulting from antibiotics were reported in 16 studies. Events were uncommon and rarely resulted in treatment discontinuation or significant alteration.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2014-07-21 15:12:59 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In this review a comprehensive and extensive literature review was performed to identify studies that assessed the benefits and harms of antibiotics to treat children with acute pyelonephritis. We found that oral antibiotic therapy alone is as effective as IV therapy followed by oral therapy, and similarly short IV therapy is as effective as longer courses of IV therapy to treat childhood acute pyelonephritis. It is unknown whether these findings apply to children less than one month of age since children aged below one month of age were excluded from studies. The exclusion criteria for participation in the included studies mean that our findings may not be generalizable to all children with acute pyelonephritis. There were 10 studies that excluded children who were severely ill or clinically unstable. Four studies did not specify any exclusion criteria. The applicability of the findings in children with uropathy may also be limited since 10 studies excluded children with known uropathy. <LINK REF="STD-Hoberman-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Hoberman 1999</LINK> performed a post hoc subgroup analysis to analyse differences in efficacy between children with or without VUR but the study was not designed and had no power to detect differences between small subgroups. Further data are required to determine whether treatment efficacy differs in children with non-dilating VUR (grades I-II) and dilating VUR (grades III-V).</P>
<P>Most of the studies examined the bacteriological efficacy of antibiotic therapy. Few studies compared the efficacy of antibiotic therapies on the resolution of clinical symptoms other than fever.</P>
<P>None of the 27 included studies analysed the optimal duration of antibiotic therapy for childhood acute pyelonephritis. Our review evaluated oral antibiotic regimens in which oral antibiotics were used either alone or following IV antibiotics for a total duration of eight to 42 days of therapy. Inadequate data are available on the benefits and harms of shorter duration therapies (e.g. seven days or less). Three studies compared single dose parenteral antibiotic therapy or short course oral therapy with seven to 10 days of oral therapy and showed no significant differences but the studies were small. This is unlike the evidence supporting the use of short-course therapies for the treatment of lower urinary tract infections in children (<LINK REF="REF-Michael-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Michael 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Michael-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Michael 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>From the low reported incidence of adverse events, we were only able to detect common adverse effects e.g. gastrointestinal upsets. Generally, RCTs are not powered to detect rare but serious side effects e.g. Stevens&#8211;Johnson syndrome, so our findings of adverse effects may not be generalizable to larger groups of children.</P>
<P>Most of the included studies reported on short-term outcomes. Nine studies analysed kidney parenchymal damage on DSMA scan at three to 12 months following an episode of acute pyelonephritis. Five of the nine studies had a high loss to follow up because of refusal to do a DMSA scan among well children and one study (not included) was terminated without any results for this reason (<LINK REF="STD-NCT00724256" TYPE="STUDY">NCT00724256</LINK>). The loss to follow up of well children may lead to an underestimate of the effect of treatment. As the longest follow up of children was 12 months, this review cannot provide data on the likelihood of long term kidney scarring following antibiotic therapy.</P>
<P>Although several studies potentially included adolescents aged to 16 years, none of the studies reported results for different age groups. Thus we could not determine whether there was any difference in results according to the patients' ages.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2014-07-10 21:01:15 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<P>The quality of the included studies was quite variable. The main limitations in the quality of the studies were concealment of allocation, blinding of participants and personnel and sponsorship from pharmaceutical companies. Of the 27 included studies, 12 reported adequate sequence generation and six demonstrated adequate allocation concealment. The lack of adequate sequence generation and allocation concealment can lead to biased estimates of treatment effects in the original study and therefore the results of a systematic review (<LINK REF="REF-Hollis-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hollis 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Juni-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Juni 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moher-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>). All of the studies were unblinded to participants and personnel primarily because antibiotics were delivered by the parenteral route compared with oral or used different dosing regimens. This was considered a high risk of bias because clinicians&#8217; management could be influenced by knowledge of the treatment group. For blinding of outcome assessors, blinding was adequate in 17 studies where the primary outcome was bacteriological or radiological and considered unlikely to be influenced by lack of blinding. We found that 19 studies provided complete data reporting and 13 reported on all reasonably expected outcomes (bacteriological eradication, clinical cure and adverse effects). The authors of 11 studies reported receiving sponsorship from pharmaceutical companies.</P>
<P>The quality of the evidence was assessed according to the GRADE approach and is displayed in summary of findings tables.</P>
<P>The evidence that oral therapy alone is as effective as IV therapy followed by oral therapy in children with acute pyelonephritis is considered to be of moderate quality. The quality of evidence was downgraded because of imprecision regarding the time to resolution of fever and the loss to follow-up for DMSA scans (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>).</P>
<P>The evidence that short duration IV therapy followed by oral therapy is as effective as long duration IV therapy is considered to be of moderate quality. The quality of evidence was downgraded because of unclear or inadequate allocation concealment in the included studies which may increase the risk of selection bias, the studies being too small and the loss to follow-up for DMSA scans (<LINK REF="SOF-02" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 2</LINK>).</P>
<P>The evidence that daily dosing of aminoglycosides is as safe and effective as thrice daily dosing of aminoglycosides is considered to be of low quality. The quality of evidence was downgraded because of unclear allocation concealment in two of three studies and the small number of participants combined with the low frequency of events that made the analysis significantly underpowered to detect a difference (<LINK REF="SOF-03" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 3</LINK>).</P>
<P>The evidence that third generation cephalosporins are no more effective than other antibiotics (amoxicillin/clavulanic acid and TMP/SMX) is low. The quality of evidence was downgraded because of unclear allocation, imprecision from sparse data, and inconsistent bacteriologic results from one study that provided most of the weight of the meta-analysis (<LINK REF="SOF-04" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 4</LINK>).</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2014-07-10 21:00:15 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<P>We attempted to reduce publication bias by searching multiple databases and the grey literature without language restriction. Although the Cochrane Renal Group's Specialised Register contains the handsearched reports of studies, it is possible that we missed unpublished data presented at smaller conferences or studies published in foreign language journals and low impact journals. Studies may have been added since our last search of the register. No data were available from the terminated study (<LINK REF="STD-NCT00724256" TYPE="STUDY">NCT00724256</LINK>) after personal communication with the lead author. Not all included studies reported all outcomes. Some outcomes that would be expected to be known (e.g. resolution of clinical symptoms) were not reported which may have affected the results of meta-analyses.</P>
</POTENTIAL_BIASES>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2014-07-21 15:16:51 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>A systematic review published in 2008 evaluated an early switch to oral antibiotics after at least one day of initial IV antibiotics with IV therapy alone for hospitalised patients with acute pyelonephritis (<LINK REF="REF-Vouloumanou-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vouloumanou 2008</LINK>). The meta-analysis included both children and adults with acute pyelonephritis but the data from the two populations could be separated. It identified all six RCTs in children that we included in our review for this comparison. The authors found there was no difference in the incidence of kidney scars, microbiological eradication, clinical cure, reinfection, persistence of acute pyelonephritis, or adverse events between the two treatment regimens. This is consistent with our finding that short duration IV therapy followed by oral therapy is as effective as longer courses of IV therapy for the treatment of acute pyelonephritis in children.</P>
<P>No other systematic reviews were found for the 11 other comparisons in our review.</P>
<P>This review agrees with recently published guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-AAP-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">AAP 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ammenti-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ammenti 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NICE-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2007</LINK>) for the treatment of childhood UTI, which recommend oral antibiotics for the initial treatment of children with acute pyelonephritis unless the child is seriously ill and/or unable to tolerate oral antibiotics. Our findings can be applied to children aged over one month. The <LINK REF="REF-NICE-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2007</LINK> guidelines apply to children aged three months or older, the <LINK REF="REF-AAP-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">AAP 2011</LINK> guidelines apply to children aged 2 to 24 months and the <LINK REF="REF-Ammenti-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ammenti 2012</LINK> recommendations apply to children aged two months to three years. The guidelines also suggest seven or more days of antibiotic treatment but recognise that this is not based on best evidence because there are no data on the optimal duration of antibiotic therapy, particularly shorter courses.</P>

<P>The following implications for practice in the treatment of children with acute pyelonephritis have been identified:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Oral antibiotics (cefixime, ceftibuten or amoxicillin/clavulanic acid) given alone for 10 to 14 days are as effective as sequential IV therapy given for three days followed by oral therapy for a total duration of 10 to 14 days suggesting that children with acute pyelonephritis can be treated effectively with oral antibiotics.</LI>
<LI>If IV antibiotic therapy is given, a short course of IV therapy given for two to four days followed by oral therapy with total therapy duration of 10 to 21 days is as effective as a longer duration of IV antibiotic therapy given for seven to 10 days with total duration of therapy of 10 to 21 days.</LI>
<LI>Studies comparing oral therapy alone with IV then oral antibiotics or IV then oral with IV therapy involved children greater than one month of age and were biased towards children who were less sick and so findings cannot be extrapolated to children less than one month of age or who are severely ill. The studies were also not stratified according to the grade of VUR so it remains unclear whether results differ according to the presence or absence of dilating VUR (grades III-V).</LI>
