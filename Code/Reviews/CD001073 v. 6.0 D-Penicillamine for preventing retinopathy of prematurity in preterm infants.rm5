<P>Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) is an eye disease of premature infants that continues to be a serious problem. The drug D-penicillamine, given by mouth, is commonly used to treat poisoning by iron or copper or other heavy metals. In research studies of D-penicillamine used for another problem that premature infants have (high bilirubin), it was observed that the treated infants had less ROP. However, this systematic review did not show any significant benefits of this drug for the outcomes of ROP, death or development of nerves. Thus, the use of this drug cannot be recommended for the prevention of ROP based on available evidence.</P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2013-09-03 11:37:43 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2013-09-03 11:36:45 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2013-09-03 11:36:45 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) is a common disorder of retinal neovascularization in premature infants (<LINK REF="REF-Palmer-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Palmer 1991</LINK>). It is of variable severity, usually heals with mild or no sequelae, but may progress in some infants to partial vision loss or blindness from retinal detachments or severe retinal scar formation. The disease is described clinically by the International Classification of ROP, which uses the location in the retina (zones), extent of disease (clock hours of disease), severity of the neovascularization (stages) and the presence or absence of 'plus' disease to describe categories of the disorder (<LINK REF="REF-ICROP-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">ICROP 1984</LINK>). Categories of 'prethreshold' and 'threshold' are summary descriptions of ROP disease severity with prognostic significance developed by the Cryotherapy for ROP Cooperative Group, where eyes that developed threshold ROP had an observed rate of 47% progression to retinal detachment or macular fold (<LINK REF="REF-CRYO_x002d_ROP-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">CRYO-ROP 1990</LINK>).</P>
<P>The incidence of both acute ROP and of the more severe stages varies inversely with gestational age at birth. ROP is unusual (except in the mildest forms) in infants of greater than 31 weeks' gestation (<LINK REF="REF-Palmer-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Palmer 1991</LINK>). However, majority of infants less than 28 weeks' gestation develop early stages of acute ROP, and close to 11% develop 'threshold ROP' requiring ablative surgery (cryotherapy or laser photocoagulation) to the peripheral avascular retina to reduce the risk of disease progression to retinal detachment (<LINK REF="REF-CRYO_x002d_ROP-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">CRYO-ROP 1990</LINK>).</P>
<P>The pathophysiology is understood to start with injury to the incomplete developing retinal capillaries. This could potentially occur before or during birth, but is thought to primarily occur in the days following delivery. Once the developing vessels have been damaged, it is hypothesized that the retina responds with the production of vascular growth factors stimulating neovascularization (which is the observable retinopathy), which may successfully revascularize the retina (regression of the ROP), or progress to neovascular membranes in the vitreous and subsequent scarring (cicatrix) and retinal detachment. Research suggests that vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is one of the more important growth factors involved in this process (<LINK REF="REF-Aiello-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aiello 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Aiello-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aiello 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>Efforts to reduce morbidity from ROP can be grouped into preventive and interdictive categories. While prevention would be best aimed at preventing premature birth, once that birth is inevitable, preventive efforts are directed at reducing stressors that may lead to injury of the developing retinal capillaries. To date (November 2012), investigations have focused on the antioxidants vitamin E or D-penicillamine, reduction of light exposure (<LINK REF="REF-Phelps-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Phelps 1997</LINK>), and control of exogenous oxygen delivery (<LINK REF="REF-Flynn-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Flynn 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kinsey-1956" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kinsey 1956</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-STOP_x002d_ROP-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">STOP-ROP 2000</LINK>). Animal models and clinical data have suggested that each of these mechanisms may cause retinal vascular injury. For purposes of determining what preventive treatments to consider using, it is important to remember that preventive interventions must be applied to all premature infants, not just those infants who develop ROP, and therefore potential side effects should be minimal.</P>
<P>Interdictive approaches target just those eyes that already have ROP of a defined severity. The goal is to control or arrest the progression of the neovascularization (even at the sacrifice of some of the retina) in order to preserve central vision. Cryosurgical or laser ablation of the peripheral avascular retina destroys the cells that are the putative source of the neovascular growth factors, thus allowing regression of the neovascularization and ablating retina that would need new vessels.</P>

<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2013-08-26 19:09:58 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>D-penicillamine is a chelating agent used in a diverse number of disorders including Wilson's disease, cystinuria and scleroderma. Previously, it has been used as a treatment for arsenic poisoning.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2013-07-31 13:40:08 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Oxygen free radicals are candidates for causing the injury to developing retinal capillaries in the premature infant. As a chelator of pro-oxidant heavy metals, D-penicillamine has the potential to reduce the amount of free radical activity in the tissues of the premature infant when given soon after birth. In addition to its oxygen radical scavenger properties, D-penicillamine is also known to alter the biological profile of native peptides by acting on disulphide bonds. Since most of the vascular growth factors depend on disulphide linkages, it could also act through reducing the bioavailability of the growth factors VEGF, endothelin-1, etc. (<LINK REF="REF-Hunt-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hunt 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Matsubara-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Matsubara 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McBrien-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">McBrien 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pietraforte-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pietraforte 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Siemeister-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Siemeister 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Yoshida-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yoshida 1995</LINK>).</P>
<P>Over an eight-year period (1974 to 1982), while studying the administration of intravenous D-penicillamine to prevent or treat hyperbilirubinaemia, Lakatos and colleagues noted a low incidence of ROP among the treated infants with few, if any, side effects (<LINK REF="STD-Lakatos-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Lakatos 1986</LINK>).</P>
<P>Side effects of oral D-penicillamine therapy when used for rheumatoid arthritis, Wilson's disease and cystinuria, have been reported in literature, and could be fatal. These include pruritus, membranous glomerulonephritis, lupus erythematosus (or similar skin eruptions), Goodpasture's syndrome, drug fever, myasthenia gravis, polymyositis, aplastic anaemia, thrombocytopenia and agranulocytosis (<LINK REF="REF-Drosos-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Drosos 1997</LINK>). Infants born following in-utero exposure have been reported with connective tissue disruption, poor wound healing or cutis laxa, although most infants exposed to D-penicillamine in utero have been normal (<LINK REF="REF-Pinter-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pinter 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>However, short courses of oral D-penicillamine therapy used in children or adults for acute heavy metal overdose have not been associated with such side effects. Among earlier studies enrolling both term and preterm newborns for the treatment of hyperbilirubinaemia, only three infants were found to have side effects; two had mild erythematous rashes that quickly resolved with antihistamines, and one had vomiting that resolved when the drug was stopped (<LINK REF="REF-Koranyi-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Koranyi 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lakatos-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lakatos 1976</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lakatos-1976a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lakatos 1976a</LINK>). Specific testing of renal and hepatic function were within normal limits on a few selected infants, and growth was not affected.</P>

<INCLUDED_STUDIES_DESCR MODIFIED="2013-07-31 13:53:04 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>A brief description of the included studies is as follows:</P>
<P>1. <LINK REF="STD-Lakatos-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Lakatos 1986</LINK>: randomised controlled trial of intravenous D-penicillamine given to 204 outborn infants of 750 to 2000 g birth weight between 1 January 1983 and 6 March 1984. Randomization after informed consent occurred in birth weight strata using sealed envelopes. D-penicillamine was started within 12 hours after birth, and given intravenously at 300 mg/kg/day (divided into three doses) for three days, then at 50 mg/kg/day (in a single dose) up to two weeks if the birth weight was less than 1500 g. Between 1500 g and 2000 g, drug was continued beyond three days only if the infant continued on oxygen. No placebo was used because of the characteristic odour of the drug. Starting at six weeks, infants were examined for ROP with an indirect ophthalmoscope without scleral depression. The ophthalmologist did not know which infants had earlier received D-penicillamine. Because scleral depression was not used, mild stages of ROP in zone 3 may have been missed in this study. However, since both groups were examined with the same technique, the rates of diagnoses in the two groups could be compared. The international classification of ROP was used to record the findings.</P>
<P>If acute ROP was diagnosed at any stage, children in the control group were then given D-penicillamine 50 mg/kg daily for three weeks. Therefore, the diagnosis of progression to severe ROP in this analysis, as well as other longer-term morbidities occurred following administration of active drug to some of the infants in the control group after six weeks of age. Most neonatal deaths occurred in the first week following birth, thus the outcome of death is unlikely to have been affected by administration of active drug to control infants who developed ROP. However, this study design feature contaminates to some degree other long-term outcomes such as growth and neurodevelopmental follow-up.</P>
<P>Deaths before discharge occurred at similar rates (29/100 in the treated infants, 34/104 in the controls), and ROP was diagnosed in none of the 71 treated survivors, and in six of the 70 control survivors. Two of the infants with ROP progressed to cicatricial stages; but neither of those cases progressed to blindness. No acute toxicity was reported in either group during hospitalisation, but there was no prospective, systematic collection of potential side effects either.</P>
<P>1a. <LINK REF="REF-Vekerdy_x002d_Lakatos-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vekerdy-Lakatos 1987</LINK> (follow-up of infants in <LINK REF="STD-Lakatos-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Lakatos 1986</LINK>): at one year of age, the infants from the study reported above were evaluated in follow-up. There were three deaths after discharge so that 69 treated (69%) and 69 control infants (66%) survived to one year of age. Of these, 87% in each group returned for evaluation. Spasticity or seizures occurred in three (5%) of the treated infants and five (8%) of the children originally randomised to the control group. There were no significant differences in developmental quotients or growth parameters, but re hospitalizations occurred more frequently in control infants (59 times in 28 children) than in the treated infants (23 times in 15 children).</P>
<P>2. <LINK REF="STD-Lakatos-1987-_x0028_2nd-trial-data_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Lakatos 1987 (2nd trial data)</LINK>: the results of this trial were reported by the authors in combination with the results of <LINK REF="STD-Lakatos-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Lakatos 1986</LINK> trial. Therefore, the results from this separate randomised controlled trial have been extracted from the data provided in these two publications. Seventy-seven infants of birth weights 751 to 1500 g were randomised to receive D-penicillamine or be controls between 1 July 1984 and 1 March 1985. Randomization was designed to be weighted 2:1 (treated:control) and the study was to end if three or more infants in the control group developed ROP. The dose was 300 mg/kg/day (divided into three doses) for three days, then 50 mg/kg/day (single dose) through to two weeks of age. Infants in the control group who later developed acute ROP were then given active drug, D-penicillamine, for three weeks (50 mg/kg/day intravenously) starting at the time of diagnosis of the ROP.<BR/>
</P>
<P>While a 2:1 randomisation ratio was intended through sealed envelopes, when the study was terminated after three infants developed ROP in the control group, the actual ratio of treated versus no treated infants was 1.4:1. Eighteen of 45 infants treated with D-penicillamine died compared to 10/32 control infants. Acute ROP occurred in 0/27 D-penicillamine survivors and in 3/22 control survivors.<BR/>
</P>
<P>3. <LINK REF="STD-Tandon-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Tandon 2010</LINK>: randomised, double-blind, single-centre, placebo-controlled trial in which oral D-penicillamine was given to 88 inborn neonates with birth weight 750 to 1500 g, gestation 32 weeks or less, age 5 days or less. Subjects were stratified for birth weight (less than 1250 g and 1250 g or greater). Block randomisation with randomly varying block sizes was carried out. The random sequence was generated online from a website by an investigator who was not involved in recruiting subjects. Between 1 January 2007 and 31 December 2007, enrolled subjects were randomly allocated to receive oral D-penicillamine suspension at 100 mg/ kg/dose every eight hours for three days, followed by 50 mg&#8260;/kg/day for another 11 days or placebo. The primary outcome was 'any ROP or death'. Secondary outcomes included any ROP, treatable ROP, adverse effects and feeding intolerance. Retinal examination was performed by an ophthalmologist with expertise in ROP screening at four to six weeks after birth or at a postmenstrual age of 31 to 33 weeks, whichever was earlier. ROP screening was repeated depending on the status of the retina.</P>
<P>Subjects were followed up until death, treatment of ROP or until the last retinal examination was performed and the baby was declared to have no ROP. A total of 88 infants were enrolled. The D-penicillamine and placebo groups comprised 44 infants each. No subject was lost to follow-up. Ten of 44 infants (22.7%) in each group either died or had ROP. Seven of 44 infants (15.9%) from the D-penicillamine group and 4/44 from the control group developed ROP. One baby in the D-penicillamine group had ROP and subsequently died. The other deaths took place before the first ROP screen. Three subjects from the D-penicillamine group and one from the placebo group required treatment.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2013-08-26 19:18:29 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The primary goal of this updated review was to determine the effect of prophylactic administration of D-penicillamine on the incidence of acute ROP, severe ROP, death and neurodevelopmental outcome. We identified three primary trials and the results of our review showed no significant difference for any of these outcomes. While the <LINK REF="STD-Lakatos-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Lakatos 1986</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Lakatos-1987-_x0028_2nd-trial-data_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Lakatos 1987 (2nd trial data)</LINK> trials used intravenous D-penicillamine, the more recent study by <LINK REF="STD-Tandon-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Tandon 2010</LINK> used oral D-penicillamine.</P>
<P>The studies included in our review investigated a small number of preterm infants (369 total, or 269 survivors). The trials by <LINK REF="STD-Lakatos-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Lakatos 1986</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Lakatos-1987-_x0028_2nd-trial-data_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Lakatos 1987 (2nd trial data)</LINK> were not placebo controlled and there was no concealment of allocation and allowed cross-over. Although they showed significant risk reduction in the incidence of ROP, it is not clear whether the lack of placebo resulted in bias.</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Tandon-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Tandon 2010</LINK>, D-penicillamine was administered orally and at a lower dose. The absolute bioavailability of oral D-penicillamine is 50% to 70% (<LINK REF="REF-Kukovetz-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kukovetz 1983</LINK>). It is unclear whether the lack of any treatment benefit noted in this trial was due to these reasons.<BR/>
</P>
<P>Current treatment for severe ROP focuses on laser therapy and visual rehabilitation, and potential new treatment strategies include targets within oxidative pathways, erythropoietin, and anti-VEGF agents (<LINK REF="REF-Hartnett-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hartnett 2012</LINK>). Although laser treatment of infants at risk for severe ROP decreases retinal detachment and reduces blindness by 25% (<LINK REF="REF-Good-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Good 2004</LINK>), non-blinding ocular morbidity is not reduced by treatment and makes preventive efforts desirable (<LINK REF="REF-Chen-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chen 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>The effectiveness of anti-VEGF treatment has been demonstrated (<LINK REF="REF-Mintz_x002d_Hittner-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mintz-Hittner 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Spandau-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spandau 2012</LINK>), but there remain concerns and limitations about its systemic safety. The anti-VEGF agent persists in the blood long after the initial intravitreal injection (<LINK REF="REF-Lee-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lee 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Matsuyama-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Matsuyama 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sato-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sato 2012</LINK>). To date, very little is known about the possible anti-VEGF effects in the brain and the lungs. Another antioxidant that has been studied for the prevention of ROP, vitamin E, has had less impact than hoped for on the incidence of ROP, but may reduce severe stages of ROP with an RR of at least 50% and also warrants further study (<LINK REF="REF-Raju-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Raju 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>D-penicillamine is a powerful antioxidant and VEGF inhibitor (<LINK REF="REF-Sanderud-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sanderud 1995</LINK>). Although our review did not show any significant benefit for any of the desired outcomes studied, the 95% CIs for many of our estimates are large, meaning that there continues to be uncertainly regarding the effects of this intervention. With point estimates of RRs well below unity for outcomes of any ROP and severe ROP, a clinical important effect cannot be ruled out in future from a randomised trial adequately powered to those outcomes. The most recent American Academy of Pediatrics guidelines proposed a birth weight of 400 g or gestational age of 23 weeks as appropriate thresholds for resuscitation (<LINK REF="REF-American-Heart-Association-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">American Heart Association 2005</LINK>). Since then there has been a trend to offer resuscitation to extremely premature babies. As none of the trials included in this review observed any serious adverse effects there is scope for conducting further trials with possibly more prolonged administration of the drug. Until then, the use of D-penicillamine cannot be recommended for the prevention of ROP based on the available evidence.</P>

<P>There is insufficient evidence to recommend routine use of D-penicillamine to prevent retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) in premature infants.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2013-07-31 13:46:00 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two of the actions of D-penicillamine provide a good biological basis for continuing investigations to test the likelihood of benefit from this drug, that is, 1) its ability to interrupt disulphide bonds and, therefore, reduce the bioavailability of vascular growth factors and impede in vivo neovascularization (<LINK REF="REF-Matsubara-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Matsubara 1989</LINK>), and 2) its function as a free radical oxygen scavenger (<LINK REF="REF-Saugstad-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Saugstad 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Staite-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Staite 1984</LINK>). Safety data to date do not raise concerns with its short-term intravenous or oral use.</P>
<P>In addition to the larger placebo-control trials to test the efficacy of D-penicillamine in the prevention of ROP in preterm infants, future trials could also compare the efficacy of this drug against new treatments such as anti-vascular endothelial growth factor agents. Careful prospective determination of the safety of this drug in the premature birth population must be a part of any such trial.</P>
