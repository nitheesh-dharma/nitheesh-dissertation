<SUMMARY>
<TITLE>Psychotherapies for hypochondriasis</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Hypochondriasis is a condition in which the sufferer believes or fears that they have an undiagnosed serious illness. It can cause much anxiety and repeated seeking of medical help and traditionally has been considered difficult to treat. A number of different psychotherapies have been suggested as treatments for sufferers of hypochondriasis, some of which have been tested in clinical trials.</P>
<P>The objective of this review was to assess whether any form of psychotherapy is effective in the management of people suffering from hypochondriasis. Six studies were included in the review. Analysis of data suggested that, compared to being on a waiting list, forms of cognitive and behaviour therapy, or a non-specific therapy called behavioural stress management all improve the symptoms of hypochondriasis. However, the numbers of people in the studies were small and it was not possible to tell how much of an improvement each therapy made. It is possible that the improvements seen were due to non-specific factors involved in regular contact with a therapist rather than specific properties of these forms of psychotherapy. It was also not possible to make comparisons between the different types of psychotherapy. A study of psychoeducation was not considered to be sufficient evidence that this form of psychotherapy is effective.</P>
</SUMMARY_BODY>
</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Hypochondriasis is associated with significant medical morbidity and high health resource use. Recent studies have examined the treatment of hypochondriasis using various forms of psychotherapy.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To examine the effectiveness and comparative effectiveness of any form of psychotherapy for the treatment of hypochondriasis.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>1. CCDANCTR-Studies and CCDANCTR-References were searched on 7/8/2007, CENTRAL, Medline, PsycINFO, EMBASE, Cinahl, ISI Web of Knowledge, AMED and WorldCat Dissertations; Current Controlled Trials meta-register (mRCT), CenterWatch, NHS National Research Register and clinicaltrials.gov; 2. Communication with authors of relevant studies and other clinicians in the field; 3. Handsearching reference lists of included studies and relevant review articles, and electronic citation search in ISI Web of Knowledge for all included studies.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>All randomised controlled studies, both published and unpublished, in any language, in which adults with hypochondriasis were treated with a psychological intervention. </P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Data were extracted independently by two authors using a standardised extraction sheet. Study quality was assessed independently by the two authors qualitatively and using a standardised scale. Meta-analyses were performed using RevMan software. Standardised or weighted mean differences were used to pool data for continuous outcomes and odds ratios were used to pool data for dichotomous outcomes, together with 95% confidence intervals.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Six studies were included, with a total of 440 participants. The interventions examined were cognitive therapy (CT), behavioural therapy (BT), cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), behavioural stress management (BSM) and psychoeducation. All forms of psychotherapy except psychoeducation showed a significant improvement in hypochondriacal symptoms compared to waiting list control (SMD (random) [95% CI] = -0.86 [-1.25 to -0.46]). For some therapies, significant improvements were found in the secondary outcomes of general functioning (CBT), resource use (psychoeducation), anxiety (CT, BSM), depression (CT, BSM) and physical symptoms (CBT). These secondary outcome findings were based on smaller numbers of participants and there was significant heterogeneity between studies. </P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>Cognitive therapy, behavioural therapy, cognitive behavioural therapy and behavioural stress management are effective in reducing symptoms of hypochondriasis. However, studies included in the review used small numbers of participants and do not allow estimation of effect size, comparison between different types of psychotherapy or whether people are "cured". Most long-term outcome data were uncontrolled. Further studies should make use of validated rating scales, assess treatment acceptability and effect on resource use, and determine the active ingredients and nonspecific factors that are important in psychotherapy for hypochondriasis.</P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
</ABSTRACT>
<BODY>
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Hypochondriasis is defined as a disorder in which there is excessive concern for one's own health. This is coupled with the belief that one has an undiagnosed physical illness, that persists despite adequate reassurance from medical staff. At present hypochondriasis is classified amongst the somatoform disorders, although its validity as a separate psychiatric entity has been questioned (<LINK REF="REF-Mayou-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mayou 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Creed-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Creed 2004</LINK>). As excessive health anxiety lies at the heart of the disorder, there have been suggestions that hypochondriasis would be better classified as an anxiety disorder (<LINK REF="REF-Noyes-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Noyes 1999</LINK>), whilst others have argued that it shares important similarities with the personality disorders (<LINK REF="REF-Tyrer-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tyrer 1990</LINK>). Both the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Edition (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1992</LINK>) and the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, 4th Edition (<LINK REF="REF-APA-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">APA 2000</LINK>) outline operationalised criteria for the diagnosis of hypochondriasis. DSM-IV specifies a minimum duration of symptoms of six months, while ICD-10 does not specify duration. Some researchers maintain that both sets of criteria are unduly strict and have therefore suggested revised (or abridged) criteria that do not insist on the persistent refusal to accept medical reassurance (<LINK REF="REF-Gureje-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gureje 1997</LINK>). Despite this disagreement amongst psychiatrists over how best to classify hypochondriasis, it remains a distressing disorder for affected patients and an under-recognised, costly and difficult disorder for physicians to contend with.</P>
<P>General population and primary care studies estimate the prevalence of hypochondriasis to be between 0.02% and 8.5%, with the population prevalence increasing to as much as 10.7% when abridged criteria are used (<LINK REF="REF-Creed-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Creed 2004</LINK>). Hypochondriasis is probably equally common amongst men and women and is associated with significant disability and high health costs (<LINK REF="REF-Creed-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Creed 2004</LINK>). A study examining the relationship with age found no association (<LINK REF="REF-Barsky-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barsky 1991</LINK>). Some studies have found an association with fewer years of education, while others have not (<LINK REF="REF-Creed-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Creed 2004</LINK>). Evidence also suggests that hypochondriasis is probably a relatively persistent condition over time (<LINK REF="REF-Barsky-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barsky 1998</LINK>); the co-existence of anxiety and/or depression is common and is associated with chronicity of the disorder (<LINK REF="REF-Simon-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Simon 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>Typically individuals with hypochondriasis present to doctors requesting investigation and reassurance, but find it difficult to be effectively reassured. This may lead to frequent presentations to primary and secondary care physicians, who find them particularly difficult to manage (<LINK REF="REF-Barsky-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barsky 2001</LINK>). For these reasons, people with hypochondriasis are not only costly to medical services but may interact with doctors in a manner that ultimately exacerbates their symptoms and distress.<BR/> <BR/>A number of different psychological models have been proposed for the aetiology of hypochondriasis. Psychodynamic writers have conceptualised the disorder either as an alternative channel for the individual's unacceptable sexual or aggressive drives, or as a defence mechanism against unbearably low self-esteem. These models postulate that the hypochondriacal position is maintained by the primary gain of a reduction in intrapsychic conflict and the secondary gains associated with legitimately assuming the sick role (<LINK REF="REF-Barsky-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barsky 1983</LINK>). The cognitive behavioural model emphasises the role of excessive attention to and misinterpretation of benign bodily sensations, and suggests that repeated attempts to gain reassurance represents a form of avoidance behaviour, which leads to a temporary relief of anxiety only to be followed by an increase in the need for reassurance (<LINK REF="REF-Warwick-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Warwick 1990</LINK>). <BR/> <BR/>In common with other anxiety and somatoform disorders, cognitive behavioural therapy has been suggested to be a potentially effective treatment modality for hypochondriasis, by challenging dysfunctional assumptions about illness and modifying behaviours of avoidance and reassurance-seeking. A psychoeducational approach involving explanation of the cognitive behavioural model has also been proposed (<LINK REF="REF-Barsky-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barsky 1998</LINK>). Other forms of psychotherapy based on theories of psychodynamic or interpersonal conflict could potentially be useful. A variety of psychotropic medications, including antidepressants, benzodiazepines and antipsychotics have been used (<LINK REF="REF-Barsky-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barsky 2001</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Ikenouchi-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ikenouchi 2004</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Lorenzo-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lorenzo 2004</LINK>). There is also a case report of the use of electro-convulsive therapy (ECT) (<LINK REF="REF-Newmark-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Newmark 2004</LINK>). An exploratory study found that patients with hypochondriasis considered cognitive behavioural therapy to be more acceptable and more effective than medication (<LINK REF="REF-Walker-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walker 1999</LINK>). However, there is little clear guidance for clinicians on how best to treat people with hypochondriasis (<LINK REF="REF-Barsky-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barsky 2001</LINK>). A first step towards providing this guidance is to critically assess the results of relevant treatment trials. The aim of this systematic review is to evaluate the available evidence on the effectiveness of psychotherapies in the treatment of hypochondriasis. </P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>To examine the effectiveness of psychotherapies for adults with a primary diagnosis of hypochondriasis.</P>
</OBJECTIVES>
<METHODS>
<SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<CRIT_STUDIES>
<P>All randomised controlled studies, both published and unpublished, were included. Trials which used cluster randomisation were included. Trials published in any language were considered.</P>
</CRIT_STUDIES>
<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>Trials of adult men and women (aged between 18 and 75) with an ICD-10 (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1992</LINK>), DSM-IV (<LINK REF="REF-APA-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">APA 2000</LINK>) or abridged or equivalent diagnosis of hypochondriasis were included.</P>
<P>Studies were excluded if participants had a co-morbid diagnosis of psychosis or a primary diagnosis of body dysmorphic disorder (DSM-IV excludes people who have delusional disorder or body dysmorphic disorder, while ICD-10 excludes people with schizophrenia). Trials in which other conditions (e.g. depression, panic) were present were included provided the primary diagnosis was hypochondriasis. Physical co-morbidity was not an exclusion criterion.</P>
</CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>All trials which included group or individual therapy, delivered as an out-patient, in-patient or in primary care, were included.</P>
<P>
<B>Active treatment</B>
<BR/>The following types of psychotherapy were included:<BR/>1) Cognitive therapy - therapy that focuses on modifying a person's present thinking, beliefs and attitudes towards illness<BR/>2) Behavioural therapy - therapy that focuses on altering a person's present behavioural responses<BR/>3) Cognitive behavioural therapy - therapy that attempts to modify present thinking, beliefs, attitudes and behavioural responses<BR/>4) Interpersonal therapy - therapy that focuses on a person's relationships with peers and family members<BR/>5) Brief psychodynamic therapy - therapy that explores unconscious meaning behind a person's symptoms<BR/>6) Hypnotherapy - therapy based on the use of hypnosis<BR/>7) Counselling - non-directive psychotherapy in which the person is encouraged to express themselves in a non-judgemental environment<BR/>8) Relaxation training - general training in relaxation techniques<BR/>9) Psychoeducation - therapy in which the main focus is the provision of information about the person's condition.</P>
<P>
<B>Psychotherapy categories </B>
<BR/>Where studies were available, comparisons between psychotherapy approaches were also to be conducted, categorised as:<BR/>1) Cognitive behavioural therapy (cognitive, behavioural, cognitive-behavioural, relaxation, psychoeducation)<BR/>2) Interpersonal therapy<BR/>3) Brief psychodynamic therapy<BR/>4) Other psychotherapies (eg counselling, hypnotherapy).</P>
<P>Trials were only included if treatment consisted of no more than 30 sessions, as only treatments that are practicably deliverable were to be assessed. Trials that combined psychotherapy with drug treatment as part of the study protocol were not included.</P>
<P>
<B>Control condition</B>
<BR/>Only trials with a specified control condition were included. The following were considered to be control conditions:<BR/>1) No treatment<BR/>2) Treatment as usual<BR/>3) Waiting list<BR/>4) Placebo treatment (e.g. tablet placebo).</P>
<P>
<B>Treatment Comparisons <BR/>
</B>Where studies were available the following main comparisons were made:<BR/>1) All forms of psychotherapy versus control<BR/>2) Cognitive therapy versus control<BR/>3) Behavioural therapy versus control<BR/>4) Cognitive behavioural therapy versus control<BR/>5) Interpersonal therapy versus control<BR/>6) Brief psychodynamic therapy versus control<BR/>7) Hypnotherapy versus control<BR/>8) Counselling versus control<BR/>9) Relaxation training versus control<BR/>10) Psychoeducation versus control</P>
<P>
<B>Additional comparisons</B>
<BR/>Where studies become available, additional comparisons between categories of psychotherapy will be conducted (eg interpersonal therapy versus brief psychodynamic therapy)</P>
</CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<CRIT_OUTCOMES>
<P>
<B>Primary outcome measures</B>
<BR/>The primary outcome was considered to be a reduction in hypochondriacal cognitions or behaviours, as measured by a hypochondriasis or health anxiety rating scale. If a validated scale was used, this was considered the primary outcome. Where visual analogue scales or unvalidated scales were used, the authors made a decision about which scale most closely approximated the symptoms of hypochondriasis.</P>
<P>Validated hypochondriasis and health anxiety scales considered for the purposes of this review were:<BR/>1) Health Anxiety Inventory (<LINK REF="REF-Salkovskis-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Salkovskis 2002</LINK>)<BR/>2) Health Anxiety Questionnaire (<LINK REF="REF-Lucock-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lucock 1996</LINK>)<BR/>3) Somatic Symptom Index (<LINK REF="REF-Barsky-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barsky 1990</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Weinstein-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weinstein 1989</LINK>)<BR/>4) Whitely Index (<LINK REF="REF-Pilowsky-1967" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pilowsky 1967</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Speckens-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Speckens 1996</LINK>)<BR/>5) Illness Attitudes Scale (<LINK REF="REF-Kellner-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kellner 1987</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<B>Secondary outcome measures</B>
<BR/>The following secondary outcomes of trials were also assessed:<BR/>1) General functioning - either i) clinician-rated, e.g. Karnofsky index (<LINK REF="REF-Karnofsky-1948" TYPE="REFERENCE">Karnofsky 1948</LINK>) or ii) patient-rated, e.g. Short Form 36 (SF-36) questionnaire (<LINK REF="REF-Jenkinson-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jenkinson 1996</LINK>)<BR/>2) Health services resource use - eg. primary or secondary care consultation rate, secondary care referral rate, use of alternative practitioners<BR/>3) Psychological distress - as measured by a validated scale for rating anxiety or depression e.g. Beck Depression Inventory (<LINK REF="REF-Beck-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beck 1979</LINK>), Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (<LINK REF="REF-Hamilton-1960" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hamilton 1960</LINK>), Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (<LINK REF="REF-Montgomery-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Montgomery 1979</LINK>), Beck Anxiety Inventory (<LINK REF="REF-Beck-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beck 1988</LINK>), or Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (<LINK REF="REF-Hamilton-1959" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hamilton 1959</LINK>)<BR/>4) Physical distress - as measured by symptom scores, e.g. the Rating Scale for Somatic Symptoms (<LINK REF="REF-Kellner-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kellner 1988</LINK>) or the Somatic Symptom Inventory (<LINK REF="REF-Weinstein-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weinstein 1989</LINK>)<BR/>5) Acceptability to participant, as measured by self-report ratings of treatment acceptability<BR/>6) Drop out rates.</P>
<P>Outcomes were classified as assessed i) within one month post treatment ii) one to six months post treatment iii) greater than six months post treatment</P>

<P>3) MEDLINE, PSYCinfo, Embase, AMED and Cinahl were searched using the CCDAN search strategy and the additional search terms hypochondri$, health anxiety, Psychotherapy, cognitive therap$, behavi$ therap$, cognitive behavi$ therap$, interpersonal therap$, psychodynamic, psychoanal$, hypno$, counsel$, explanatory therap$, group therap$, family therap$, stress management, exposure response prevention, psychoeducation;</P>
<P>4) ISI Web of Knowledge was searched using the search terms hypochondria*, health anxiety, Psychotherapy, cognitive therap*, behavi* therap*, cognitive behavi* therap*, interpersonal therap*, psychodynamic, psychoanal*, hypno*, counsel*, explanatory therap*, group therap*, family therap*, stress management, exposure response prevention, psychoeducation</P>
<P>For each included study, a cited reference search was performed in ISI Web of Knowledge to identify any later studies that may have cited it as a reference.</P>
<P>5) WorldCat Dissertations was searched using the search terms hypochondriasis, health anxiety.</P>
<P>
<B>Personal communication</B>
<BR/>Experts in the field were contacted and asked to identify other published and unpublished trials.</P>
<P>
<B>Reference lists</B>
<BR/>The reference lists of retrieved studies and relevant review articles were reviewed to identify any other studies.</P>
</SEARCH_METHODS>
<DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>
<B>Study selection</B>
<BR/>Abstracts of potentially relevant studies were inspected by the review authors and full articles requested where there was an indication that they might be relevant. Where unpublished trials were identified, the co-ordinators were contacted to request the data. Full papers were then inspected independently by the review authors to assess whether studies fulfilled criteria for inclusion in this review. Any disagreement was resolved by discussion or use of a third opinion. </P>
<P>
<B>Quality assessment</B>
<BR/>Methodological quality was assessed independently by both review authors according to the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2006</LINK>). This was in the form of a qualitative assessment for the presence of bias under the following categories:<BR/>1) Selection bias<BR/>2) Performance bias<BR/>3) Attrition bias<BR/>4) Detection bias.</P>
<P>The presence of each category of bias was assessed as being likely, possible, unlikely or unclear. An additional quality assessment was performed using the Cochrane Collaboration Depression and Anxiety Group Quality Rating Scale (QRS) (<LINK REF="REF-Moncrieff-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moncrieff 2001</LINK>). The QRS consists of 23 items, including items on sample size, allocation, use of diagnostic criteria, compliance, attrition and statistical analysis. Total scores range from 0-46. Quality rating scores were used for descriptive purposes and to categorise studies into high and low quality, for sensitivity analyses. Any disagreements between authors were resolved by discussion.</P>
<P>
<B>Data extraction</B>
<BR/>Data from identified trials were independently extracted by the review authors using a standardised extraction sheet. Any disagreements were discussed. Where data were missing from the published studies, attempts were made to obtain this by correspondence with the trial authors. Information extracted included the characteristics of the study, design and methods used, number and characteristics of participants, nature of intervention, nature of control, outcomes and results. Results were entered into an Excel spreadsheet then transferred into Review Manager software (RevMan) for analysis. Accuracy of data entry was checked by using the double data entry feature.</P>
<P>
<B>Analysis</B>
<BR/>Where appropriate, outcome data were pooled using RevMan software. Dichotomous data such as dropout rates were pooled using odds ratios. Where ordinal rating scales were used, results were treated as continuous data. Continuous data were pooled using weighted mean differences where outcomes were measured using the same validated rating scales, or by using standardised mean differences where outcomes are measured on different or unvalidated rating scales. All outcome data other than dropout rates was either in the form of long ordinal scales or continuous visual analogue scales and so were treated as continuous data. Where studies did not use intention-to-treat analyses, an available case analysis was used. </P>
<P>Studies were assessed for heterogeneity using both the chi-squared and the I-squared tests. Forest plots were also visually inspected to assess for heterogeneity. Given the small number of studies and the heterogeneity between them, random-effects models were used to pool outcome data (<LINK REF="REF-Field-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Field 2003</LINK>). If a primary outcome was not stated in the study, the review authors agreed by discussion on an outcome measure to use as the primary outcome. </P>
<P>Results from all the studies were pooled in a meta-analysis of all forms of psychotherapy. In order to avoid making multiple comparisons with the same control group, where studies had more than one treatment arm, data from both treatment arms were combined. Dichotomous outcomes were combined by taking the sums of the number of events (e.g. dropouts) and the number of participants in both active treatment arms. The means of continuous data were combined using the formula shown in <LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>.The combined standard deviations of continuous data were obtained using the formula shown in <LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK> (<LINK REF="REF-Cooper-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cooper 1994</LINK>). The combined means and standard deviations for the two active treatment arms were then compared to the control outcome data for each trial.</P>
<P>Where studies used a cluster randomisation design, it was planned to divide the original sample size by the design effect, calculated from the average cluster size and the intracluster correlation coefficient (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2006</LINK>), where deemed necessary. </P>
<P>Subgroup analyses were defined a priori and carried out as follows:<BR/>1) By differing diagnostic criteria<BR/>2) By validated versus unvalidated scales for hypochondriasis <BR/>3) By total psychotherapy exposure time (&lt;8h versus &gt;8h).</P>
<P>A sensitivity analysis was performed as follows:<BR/>1) Comparing high and low quality studies, based on QRS scores of equal or less than 25 and greater than 25<BR/>2) By including all studies in the meta-analysis regardless of the time point of the outcome measures.</P>
<P>The construction of funnel plots to assess for publication bias was considered, but there were not sufficient studies included in this review.</P>
<P>
<B>Methods for updating the review</B>
<BR/>This is the first published version of this review. We will review the protocol and repeat the search strategy every two years. If additional studies are identified for inclusion then the review will be updated. Additionally, if the authors become aware of studies that should be included in the review, then the search strategy will be repeated and the review updated.</P>
</DATA_COLLECTION>
</METHODS>
<RESULTS>
<STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<P>Thirty-seven studies were identified. Six were included and 26 excluded. Of the remainder two are ongoing and three are awaiting assessment. There were no disagreements between review authors regarding study inclusion. See tables of Characteristics of Excluded Studies and Included Studies.</P>
<P>
<B>Excluded Studies</B>
<BR/>Twenty published studies did not meet inclusion criteria. Of these, 12 studies did not use a randomised design (<LINK REF="STD-Avia-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Avia 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bouman-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Bouman 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kellner-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Kellner 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kellner-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Kellner 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kenyon-1964" TYPE="STUDY">Kenyon 1964</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Langlois-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Langlois 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Martinez-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Martinez 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Papageorgiou-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Papageorgiou 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stern-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Stern 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Visser-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Visser 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Warwick-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Warwick 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wattar-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Wattar 2005</LINK>); three studies did not use standard diagnostic criteria for hypochondriasis (<LINK REF="STD-Jones-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Jones 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kellner-1971" TYPE="STUDY">Kellner 1971</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tyrer-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Tyrer 1999</LINK>) and three studies were case series (<LINK REF="STD-Brown-1936" TYPE="STUDY">Brown 1936</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Salkovskis-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Salkovskis 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Townend-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Townend 1994</LINK>).

<B>Included Studies</B>
<BR/>Six studies were identified for inclusion in this review (<LINK REF="STD-Barsky-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Barsky 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Clark-1998-a" TYPE="STUDY">Clark 1998 a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fava-2000-b" TYPE="STUDY">Fava 2000 b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Greeven-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Greeven 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Visser-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Visser 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Warwick-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Warwick 1996</LINK>). All were published in English language journals.</P>
<P>
<B>Description of Study Design</B>
<BR/>All included studies were randomised controlled trials. One study used a cluster randomised design (<LINK REF="STD-Barsky-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Barsky 2004</LINK>), whereby primary care physicians were randomised to determine whether participants received CBT or treatment as usual. Only 11 out of 163 physicians in the trial had more that one participant. A sensitivity analysis of the potential effect of clustering was reported in the paper, in which an analysis using only one subject selected at random from each of the clusters (excluding 24 participants) was compared to an analysis using data from all participants. The results did not differ. Therefore, the effect of clustering in this study was not considered significant. Four studies used designs in which a proportion of subjects were initially placed on a waiting list and later entered into therapy (<LINK REF="STD-Clark-1998-a" TYPE="STUDY">Clark 1998 a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fava-2000-b" TYPE="STUDY">Fava 2000 b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Visser-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Visser 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Warwick-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Warwick 1996</LINK>). One of these studies (<LINK REF="STD-Clark-1998-a" TYPE="STUDY">Clark 1998 a</LINK>) reported combined post-treatment outcomes for the initial intervention group plus the later group that had originally been part of the control group. Therefore, comparison of these outcomes to the control group partly involved between-groups comparison and partly a within-group comparison. Since within-group comparison potentially provides a more precise estimate (<LINK REF="REF-Senn-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Senn 2002</LINK>), the data were handled conservatively by treating them as for a between-groups comparison, for the purposes of meta-analysis.</P>
<P>
<B>Participants</B>
<BR/>One study recruited subjects exclusively from secondary care (<LINK REF="STD-Fava-2000-b" TYPE="STUDY">Fava 2000 b</LINK>), whilst two studies recruited from both primary and secondary care (<LINK REF="STD-Clark-1998-a" TYPE="STUDY">Clark 1998 a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Warwick-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Warwick 1996</LINK>). One study recruited from primary care and also used volunteer subjects who responded to public announcements (<LINK REF="STD-Barsky-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Barsky 2004</LINK>). One study recruited from secondary care and also used volunteer subjects who responded to public announcements (<LINK REF="STD-Greeven-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Greeven 2004</LINK>). One study did not state from where subjects were recruited (<LINK REF="STD-Visser-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Visser 2001</LINK>). </P>
<P>Three studies included subjects who fulfilled DSM-IV criteria for hypochondriasis (<LINK REF="STD-Fava-2000-b" TYPE="STUDY">Fava 2000 b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Greeven-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Greeven 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Visser-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Visser 2001</LINK>), whilst two studies used DSM-IIIR criteria (<LINK REF="STD-Clark-1998-a" TYPE="STUDY">Clark 1998 a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Warwick-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Warwick 1996</LINK>). One study used a predetermined cut-off on a combined Whitely Index and Somatic Symptom Inventory (<LINK REF="STD-Barsky-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Barsky 2004</LINK>), with 61% of participants fulfilling DSM-IV criteria.</P>
<P>All studies excluded subjects with serious psychiatric co-morbidity (e.g. psychosis). Only one study (<LINK REF="STD-Visser-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Visser 2001</LINK>) did not exclude subjects who had significant medical co-morbidity, although the other studies defined this exclusion criterion in different ways. Two studies excluded those that had received CBT previously (<LINK REF="STD-Visser-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Visser 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Warwick-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Warwick 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<B>Cultural Setting</B>
<BR/>Two studies were set in the United Kingdom (<LINK REF="STD-Warwick-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Warwick 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Clark-1998-a" TYPE="STUDY">Clark 1998 a</LINK>), two studies in the Netherlands (<LINK REF="STD-Greeven-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Greeven 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Visser-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Visser 2001</LINK>), one study in the United States (<LINK REF="STD-Barsky-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Barsky 2004</LINK>) and one study in Italy (<LINK REF="STD-Fava-2000-b" TYPE="STUDY">Fava 2000 b</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<B>Sample Size</B>
<BR/>The number of subjects randomised into the studies varied from 20 (<LINK REF="STD-Fava-2000-b" TYPE="STUDY">Fava 2000 b</LINK>) to 187 (<LINK REF="STD-Barsky-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Barsky 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<B>Interventions</B>
<BR/>The active intervention in all six trials was individual (one to one) therapy delivered in an outpatient setting. Three studies used CBT (<LINK REF="STD-Barsky-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Barsky 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Greeven-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Greeven 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Warwick-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Warwick 1996</LINK>), two studies used CT (<LINK REF="STD-Visser-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Visser 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Clark-1998-a" TYPE="STUDY">Clark 1998 a</LINK>), one study used explanatory therapy (<LINK REF="STD-Fava-2000-b" TYPE="STUDY">Fava 2000 b</LINK>); one study used exposure plus response prevention (which was classified as behavioural therapy for the purposes of this study) (<LINK REF="STD-Visser-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Visser 2001</LINK>) and one study used behavioural stress management (<LINK REF="STD-Clark-1998-a" TYPE="STUDY">Clark 1998 a</LINK>). </P>
<P>Explanatory therapy (<LINK REF="STD-Fava-2000-b" TYPE="STUDY">Fava 2000 b</LINK>) is described as providing patient education, reassurance and teaching of the principles of selective attention - it is said to differ from CBT in that it is simpler to deliver and does not contain behavioural components. For the purposes of this review explanatory therapy was classified as psychoeducation. </P>
<P>Behavioural stress management combined elements of relaxation, problem-solving, assertiveness training and time management. It was developed as an alternative to cognitive behavioural therapy with the aim of addressing the anxious and avoidant aspects of hypochondriasis. Although this did not fit into any predefined category of psychotherapy, it seemed sufficiently different to be considered as a separate form of therapy.</P>
<P>Three studies had one active treatment and one control arm (<LINK REF="STD-Barsky-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Barsky 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fava-2000-b" TYPE="STUDY">Fava 2000 b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Warwick-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Warwick 1996</LINK>). Two studies had two active treatment arms, both psychotherapy, and one control arm (<LINK REF="STD-Clark-1998-a" TYPE="STUDY">Clark 1998 a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Visser-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Visser 2001</LINK>). One study had two active treatment arms - one psychotherapy and one medication arm - and a control arm (<LINK REF="STD-Greeven-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Greeven 2004</LINK>). Amount of therapy time in the active arm varied from four hours (<LINK REF="STD-Fava-2000-b" TYPE="STUDY">Fava 2000 b</LINK>) to 19 hours (<LINK REF="STD-Clark-1998-a" TYPE="STUDY">Clark 1998 a</LINK>). Four studies used waiting list controls (<LINK REF="STD-Visser-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Visser 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Warwick-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Warwick 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fava-2000-b" TYPE="STUDY">Fava 2000 b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Clark-1998-a" TYPE="STUDY">Clark 1998 a</LINK>), one allocated controls to receive treatment as usual from their primary care physician (<LINK REF="STD-Barsky-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Barsky 2004</LINK>) and one used placebo tablets plus medication review appointments (<LINK REF="STD-Greeven-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Greeven 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<B>Outcome measures</B>
<BR/>A wide range of outcome measures was used in the studies. All the studies used a measure of hypochondriacal cognitions and behaviours. Three studies did not specify a primary outcome measure (<LINK REF="STD-Clark-1998-a" TYPE="STUDY">Clark 1998 a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fava-2000-b" TYPE="STUDY">Fava 2000 b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Warwick-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Warwick 1996</LINK>). Of the three studies that did specify a primary outcome, two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Barsky-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Barsky 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Greeven-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Greeven 2004</LINK>) used the Whiteley Index (<LINK REF="REF-Pilowsky-1967" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pilowsky 1967</LINK>) and one study (<LINK REF="STD-Visser-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Visser 2001</LINK>) used the health anxiety subscale of the Illness Attitudes Scale (<LINK REF="REF-Kellner-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kellner 1987</LINK>). The Illness Attitudes Scale was also included in one study which did not specify a primary outcome (<LINK REF="STD-Fava-2000-b" TYPE="STUDY">Fava 2000 b</LINK>). Two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Clark-1998-a" TYPE="STUDY">Clark 1998 a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Warwick-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Warwick 1996</LINK>) did not use recognised hypochondriasis scales but instead used a number of visual analogue scales devised by the authors to assess different aspects of health anxiety. <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK> gives details of the outcome measures selected for the analyses.</P>
<P>Two studies included measures of physical distress: one study (<LINK REF="STD-Fava-2000-b" TYPE="STUDY">Fava 2000 b</LINK>) used the Rating Scale of Somatic Symptoms (<LINK REF="REF-Kellner-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kellner 1988</LINK>) and another (<LINK REF="STD-Barsky-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Barsky 2004</LINK>) used the Somatic Symptom Inventory (<LINK REF="REF-Weinstein-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weinstein 1989</LINK>). </P>
<P>Four studies included measures of psychiatric symptoms: two (<LINK REF="STD-Greeven-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Greeven 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Visser-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Visser 2001</LINK>) used the Dutch version of the SCL-90 Symptom Checklist (<LINK REF="REF-Arrindell-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Arrindell 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Derogatis-1973" TYPE="REFERENCE">Derogatis 1973</LINK>), three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Clark-1998-a" TYPE="STUDY">Clark 1998 a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Visser-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Visser 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Warwick-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Warwick 1996</LINK>) used the Beck Depression Inventory (<LINK REF="REF-Beck-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beck 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bouman-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bouman 1985</LINK>), one study (<LINK REF="STD-Greeven-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Greeven 2004</LINK>) used the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale and the Brief Anxiety Scale (<LINK REF="REF-Montgomery-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Montgomery 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tyrer-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tyrer 1984</LINK>) two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Clark-1998-a" TYPE="STUDY">Clark 1998 a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Warwick-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Warwick 1996</LINK>) used the Beck Anxiety Inventory (<LINK REF="REF-Beck-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beck 1988</LINK>), and one study (<LINK REF="STD-Clark-1998-a" TYPE="STUDY">Clark 1998 a</LINK>) also used the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (<LINK REF="REF-Hamilton-1959" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hamilton 1959</LINK>).</P>
<P>Only one study (<LINK REF="STD-Barsky-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Barsky 2004</LINK>) assessed functional outcome, using the Functional Status Questionnaire (<LINK REF="REF-Cleary-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cleary 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jette-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jette 1986</LINK>). One study (<LINK REF="STD-Fava-2000-b" TYPE="STUDY">Fava 2000 b</LINK>) assessed health service use by measuring the number of physician visits and laboratory tests over a 3-month period.</P>
<P>All six studies provided data on the number of dropouts. No study measured the acceptability of the therapy to participants.<BR/>
<B>
<BR/>Study Length</B>
<BR/>Length of follow-up varied from immediately post treatment only (<LINK REF="STD-Greeven-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Greeven 2004</LINK>) to 12 months post treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Barsky-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Barsky 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Clark-1998-a" TYPE="STUDY">Clark 1998 a</LINK>). Only one study made comparisons between treatment and control at time points later than immediately post-treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Barsky-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Barsky 2004</LINK>).</P>
</STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<STUDY_QUALITY>
<P>
<B>Randomisation method</B>
<BR/>Only one study provided details of the method of randomisation, which was judged to be adequate (<LINK REF="STD-Greeven-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Greeven 2004</LINK>). This study used block randomisation, in which an independent statistician prepared allocation information in sealed opaque envelopes that were opened when a participant was included in the study. </P>
<P>
<B>Allocation concealment</B>
<BR/>Only two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Barsky-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Barsky 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Greeven-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Greeven 2004</LINK>) described adequate allocation concealment, although one of these used cluster randomisation of physicians rather than participants. This could have resulted in a small number of participants (approximately 25 out of 187) failing to receive concealed allocation because their physician had already been randomised (<LINK REF="STD-Barsky-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Barsky 2004</LINK>). None of the other included studies described allocation concealment; therefore the quality was judged to be 'unclear' on this validity criterion. </P>
<P>
<B>Blinding</B>
<BR/>Blinding of participants is difficult to achieve in psychotherapeutic trials, since participants are aware of the type of therapy that they are receiving or whether they are on a waiting list. All studies used self-report rating scales. One study (<LINK REF="STD-Warwick-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Warwick 1996</LINK>) used participants' therapists to rate several measures; the therapists could not have been blinded and were therefore subject to observer bias. Four studies also used some scales rated by an independent assessor; three stated that the assessor was blinded (<LINK REF="STD-Fava-2000-b" TYPE="STUDY">Fava 2000 b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Greeven-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Greeven 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Warwick-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Warwick 1996</LINK>), and one did not specify (<LINK REF="STD-Clark-1998-a" TYPE="STUDY">Clark 1998 a</LINK>).<BR/>
<B>
<BR/>Baseline characteristics</B>
<BR/>No study reported significant differences in age or gender between treatment and control groups, although one study failed to report any sociodemographic comparisons (<LINK REF="STD-Clark-1998-a" TYPE="STUDY">Clark 1998 a</LINK>) and another reported only that no significant difference had been found (<LINK REF="STD-Warwick-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Warwick 1996</LINK>). Of the three studies that presented comparisons of baseline characteristics (<LINK REF="STD-Barsky-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Barsky 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fava-2000-b" TYPE="STUDY">Fava 2000 b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Visser-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Visser 2001</LINK>), only two performed statistical tests for differences between groups (<LINK REF="STD-Barsky-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Barsky 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Greeven-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Greeven 2004</LINK>). </P>
<P>
<B>Interventions</B>
<BR/>One study did not include information on supervision or monitoring of the active intervention (<LINK REF="STD-Fava-2000-b" TYPE="STUDY">Fava 2000 b</LINK>). One study used manualised treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Barsky-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Barsky 2004</LINK>) and four studies used tape recordings of the sessions to supervise and/or audit treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Clark-1998-a" TYPE="STUDY">Clark 1998 a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Greeven-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Greeven 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Visser-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Visser 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Warwick-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Warwick 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>One study may have introduced performance bias, as there was evidence of co-intervention (<LINK REF="STD-Barsky-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Barsky 2004</LINK>): a detailed letter of advice was sent to all primary care physicians whose patients were randomised to receive the active treatment. This meant that it was not possible to attribute any change to the psychotherapy (CBT) alone, as the letter could have significantly altered the GPs' management in the active group.</P>
<P>Studies that had two active psychotherapy arms (behavioural and cognitive) as well as a control arm (<LINK REF="STD-Clark-1998-a" TYPE="STUDY">Clark 1998 a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Visser-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Visser 2001</LINK>) also showed some evidence of co-intervention, as the cognitive therapy arms contained elements of behavioural therapy.</P>
<P>
<B>Dropouts</B>
<BR/>All studies reported whether participants left the trial early for any reason. Dropout rates varied from 3.1% to 28.2%. Three studies used an intention-to-treat analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Barsky-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Barsky 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fava-2000-b" TYPE="STUDY">Fava 2000 b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Greeven-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Greeven 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<B>Selective reporting</B>
<BR/>There was nothing in the papers to suggest selective reporting of outcome data. All studies presented all outcome data that had been described in the "methods" sections and included these data in the analyses. However, some studies did not include secondary outcome measures that had been included in other studies and the results reported were positive and generally statistically significant.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality Rating Scale scores</B>
<BR/>Quality Rating Scale (<LINK REF="REF-Moncrieff-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moncrieff 2001</LINK>) scores ranged from 21 (<LINK REF="STD-Visser-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Visser 2001</LINK>) to 30 (<LINK REF="STD-Barsky-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Barsky 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Greeven-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Greeven 2004</LINK>), mean score 25.8.</P>
</STUDY_QUALITY>
<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
<P>Although all studies reported follow-up data, most studies were designed so that the waiting list groups were allocated to active therapy immediately after the first period of therapy and assessment ended. Therefore, they were only a parallel group design until the first post-treatment assessment, after which they were uncontrolled trials. Only one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Barsky-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Barsky 2004</LINK>) provided sufficient control data to enable treatment versus control comparisons to be made at later follow-up points. All other comparisons were made immediately post treatment.<BR/> <BR/>
<B>Comparison 1: All forms of psychotherapy versus waiting list/usual medical care/tablet placebo</B>
<BR/>Where possible, the outcome data from the five included studies that reported outcomes immediately post-treatment, with a total of 247 participants, were pooled for most of the outcomes (<LINK REF="STD-Clark-1998-a" TYPE="STUDY">Clark 1998 a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fava-2000-b" TYPE="STUDY">Fava 2000 b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Greeven-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Greeven 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Visser-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Visser 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Warwick-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Warwick 1996</LINK>). Data from the study which did not report outcomes immediately post-treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Barsky-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Barsky 2004</LINK>) were not pooled in this comparison. Where only one form of psychotherapy examined a secondary outcome, this is reported under the relevant section below.</P>
<P>
<I>01.01 Hypochondriasis</I>
<BR/>The psychotherapy group did significantly better than the waiting list group (SMD (random) = -0.86 [95% CI -1.25 to -0.46]). There was significant heterogeneity between trials (chi-squared = 7.65, p = 0.11, I-squared =47.7%).</P>

The psychotherapy group did significantly better than the waiting list group. (SMD (random) = -0.41 [95% CI -0.69 to -0.13]).

</INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>This review found a significant favourable effect on symptoms of hypochondriasis for all forms of psychotherapy that used cognitive behavioural therapy, cognitive therapy, behavioural therapy or behavioural stress management approaches. Although the meta-analysis of CBT immediately post-treatment just failed to reach significance, the results at 12-month follow-up show a significant difference; therefore we consider this probable evidence for the effectiveness of CBT. Where assessed, there were also significant favourable effects on measures of general functioning (CBT), resource use (psychoeducation), depression (CT, BT, BSM), anxiety (CT, BSM) and physical symptoms (CBT). There was no significant difference in dropout rates between treatment and control groups, which suggests that participants found the treatment acceptable. However, only one study attempted to assess the acceptability of treatments (<LINK REF="STD-Clark-1998-a" TYPE="STUDY">Clark 1998 a</LINK>). No studies examined the effectiveness of other forms of psychotherapy (interpersonal therapy, psychodynamic therapy, hypnotherapy, relaxation therapy, counselling) for hypochondriasis. </P>
<P>There were few randomised controlled studies of psychotherapy for hypochondriasis, and the majority used a small sample size. All studies could be considered to be of moderate methodological quality. The outcome measures were inconsistent between studies, with few studies using an unaltered, validated hypochondriasis scale, or stating a primary outcome measure. Most studies used multiple measures for the different dimensions of hypochondriasis and performed separate analyses for each. This approach increases the risk of type one error. This is illustrated by the study of psychoeducation: although the paper reported positive findings, when we made an a priori decision to select a single primary outcome, this review did not find a significant difference between treatment and control. We do not conclude that psychoeducation is ineffective in hypochondriasis, but that more research is needed before it can be recommended as a treatment.</P>
<P>Half of the included studies did not report an intention-to-treat analysis and it was not possible to impute missing data. Although this raises the possibility of attrition bias, there was no significant difference in dropout rates between groups for any study. However, when interpreting the generalisability of the results it may be more important to consider the characteristics of people who consent to participate in psychotherapy trials. The treatment of hypochondriasis by psychotherapy techniques depends on the patient's willingness to engage with such treatment. As the conviction that one has a serious physical illness is a core feature of the disorder, it is likely that some patients will be unwilling to participate in psychotherapy, and that these patients would not be represented in trials of psychotherapy. In one trial, only 30% of eligible patients agreed to participate (<LINK REF="STD-Barsky-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Barsky 2004</LINK>). This possibility restricts the generalisability of the findings to hypochondriacal patients who are prepared to undertake psychotherapy. An association has been found between low motivation for psychotherapy and poorer outcome in somatisation disorders (<LINK REF="REF-Timmer-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Timmer 2006</LINK>) and this factor may also be relevant in hypochondriasis. It remains unclear what approaches best help those who do not agree to participate in psychotherapy.</P>
<P>The subgroup analyses identified possible causes of heterogeneity: studies that had the largest amount of therapist time and used visual analogue scales had a larger effect size than studies with smaller amounts of therapist time which used standardised scales. Since both studies that used visual analogue scales were also in the &gt;10hrs total therapist time group, it is not possible to definitely identify one as a causative factor; it seems plausible that a larger amount of face-to-face time with a therapist results in a greater improvement in symptoms, although the possibility remains that the use of patient-rated visual analogue scales detected an artificially large effect size.</P>
<P>These findings suggest that nonspecific factors may play a substantial role in the treatment of hypochondriasis. Waiting list groups do not control for therapist time, which is often an important element in the treatment of psychiatric disorders. It is possible that participants on a waiting list do not expect to recover until they have had psychotherapy, which may increase the size of the effect found in favour of the active treatment. It is of note that the primary outcome of the only study in which the control condition involved regular face-to-face reviews did not show a significant difference in the meta-analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Greeven-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Greeven 2004</LINK>). This suggestion is also consistent with the observation that effect size is positively correlated with amount of therapist time for the included studies. Although a strong correlation was found, this should be interpreted with caution as the number of studies is very small. This review excluded studies which did not compare treatment to a control group such as a waiting list, treatment as usual or some form of placebo, i.e. a condition which would not be expected to produce clinical improvement; this led to the exclusion of some studies which made comparisons between different forms of psychotherapy. Such exclusion criteria may be justified on the grounds that the efficacy of a psychotherapy should be established before comparisons are made to others, but it does not eliminate the conceptual and methodological difficulties of establishing a credible and equivalent placebo condition which adequately controls for nonspecific factors (<LINK REF="REF-Borkovec-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Borkovec 2005</LINK>)</P>
<P>The possible importance of non-specific therapeutic factors is also suggested by the finding of positive outcomes in both arms of studies that had two active treatments. One study devised a non-specific treatment - behavioural stress management - which deliberately did not address hypochondriasis. Nevertheless this treatment produced significant improvements compared to a waiting list: although they reported sooner and larger initial improvements in the specific treatment arm (CT), there was no significant difference between the two treatments by 12-month follow-up (<LINK REF="STD-Clark-1998-a" TYPE="STUDY">Clark 1998 a</LINK>). This finding is consistent with trials comparing different treatments for hypochondriasis that did not include a control group, which have reported improvements after treatment with, but no significant difference between, both forms of treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Bouman-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Bouman 1998</LINK> - CT versus exposure plus response prevention; <LINK REF="STD-Buwalda-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Buwalda 2006</LINK> - group CBT versus group problem-solving). It is also consistent with a meta-analysis of recent psychotherapy trials for any condition, which found a significantly smaller effect size when the placebo treatment was structurally similar to the active treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Baskin-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baskin 2003</LINK>). A review of psychotherapy trials for other somatoform disorders similarly found positive effects for cognitive, behavioural, or cognitive-behavioural therapies (<LINK REF="REF-Allen-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Allen 2002</LINK>). However, as in this review, the majority of studies compared the intervention with treatment as usual or a waiting list.</P>
<P>Although statistically significant improvements were shown for psychotherapy in hypochondriasis, it is difficult to interpret their magnitude or clinical significance. No study assessed dichotomous outcomes, e.g. whether participants still met diagnostic criteria for hypochondriasis at the end of treatment. This approach may be justified if one is aiming not to "cure" a disorder but merely to ameliorate the associated symptoms and distress, but it is necessary to be sure that the outcome scales are designed to accurately measure change in core symptoms. The use of validated rating scales would also allow some estimation of the magnitude of change to be made, for example by comparing outcome scores to the case and reference scores of the validation study. Due to the diversity of outcome measures used, it was also not possible to make direct comparisons of effect size between different types of psychotherapy. </P>
<P>It is not possible to draw conclusions about the long-term effects of psychotherapy on hypochondriasis. The maximum length of follow-up in the included studies was 12 months, but only one study was designed to make comparisons with a control group at that time point (<LINK REF="STD-Barsky-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Barsky 2004</LINK>). However, as the study authors acknowledge, it is not possible to attribute the effect entirely to the psychotherapy: the GPs of participants in the treatment group were given advice on management, which would have altered the treatment this group received in the 12-month period following psychotherapy. The efficacy of such advice has been demonstrated in the treatment of somatoform disorders (<LINK REF="REF-Rost-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rost 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Smith-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smith 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Smith-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smith 1995</LINK>). Although the other studies of CBT reported that significant improvements were maintained at the end of follow-up (three and seven months), it is not possible to draw firm conclusions about whether this maintenance would occur without treatment in the absence of direct comparisons.</P>
<P>This review has examined several different approaches to the psychotherapeutic treatment of hypochondriasis, but these are not the only ones in clinical practice. The excluded studies evaluated a number of other forms of psychotherapy, including group CBT (<LINK REF="STD-Avia-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Avia 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Buwalda-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Buwalda 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stern-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Stern 1991</LINK>), group psychoeducation (<LINK REF="STD-Bouman-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Bouman 2002</LINK>), group problem-solving (<LINK REF="STD-Buwalda-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Buwalda 2006</LINK>), biofeedback-assisted relaxation training (<LINK REF="STD-Fried-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Fried 1978</LINK>), bibliotherapy (<LINK REF="STD-Jones-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Jones 2002</LINK>) and attention training (<LINK REF="STD-Papageorgiou-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Papageorgiou 1998</LINK>). If these are to be recommended they would need to be tested in randomised controlled trials, but at present there is insufficient evidence to recommend these therapies. Nevertheless, the results of this review are encouraging and provide evidence to support the use of some forms of psychotherapy, namely CT, BSM, BT and CBT, in the treatment of hypochondriasis. Further studies using standardised and validated assessment scales will be needed to confirm these results, assess other forms of psychotherapy and make comparisons between different psychotherapy approaches.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>
<I>
<BR/>1) Implications for people with hypochondriasis</I>
<BR/>Psychotherapies using cognitive therapy, exposure plus response prevention (i.e. behavioural therapy), cognitive behaviour therapy or behavioural stress management approaches are effective in reducing symptoms of hypochondriasis. However, the findings are based on small numbers of participants and do not allow estimation of the size of the effect, comparison between different types of psychotherapy or whether patients are "cured". Most long-term outcome data were uncontrolled.</P>
<P>
<I>2) Implications for clinicians</I>
<BR/>Hypochondriasis is a condition that is managed largely in primary care. People with hypochondriasis may see a variety of specialists and may be reluctant to see a psychiatrist. Clinicians need to be aware of the existence of this condition and the evidence for effective forms of psychotherapy. They should be aware of what services are available locally and the pathways to access such services. Clinicians need to be able to communicate to patients the nature of the disorder and to encourage them to accept effective treatment. Psychological therapies in primary care are often psychodynamic or person-centred in approach. These have not been studied in RCTs for hypochondriasis and consideration should be given to referral to specialist services.</P>
<P>
<I>3) Implications for managers and policymakers</I>
<BR/>Managers and policymakers need to be aware that there are effective forms of psychotherapy available for the treatment of hypochondriasis and to consider making this treatment available. Studies of these psychotherapies have not addressed the cost-effectiveness of such treatment or the potential effects on resource use, although it is known that hypochondriasis is associated with significantly more resource use (<LINK REF="REF-Creed-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Creed 2004</LINK>).<I>
<BR/>
</I>
</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>1) Further well-designed trials of psychotherapy are required. These should include larger numbers of participants, longer follow-up times and a credible control condition. Given the prevalence of counselling and psychodynamic therapies in primary care, these should be evaluated for efficacy in hypochondriasis.<BR/>2) Further trials should be designed to assess not only whether a psychotherapy is effective, but also which elements are active.<BR/>3) To facilitate future comparisons between trials, trials should state a primary outcome measure and use a validated assessment scale for hypochondriasis<BR/>4) To facilitate healthcare planning and economic evaluation, trials should include an assessment of effect on healthcare resource use<BR/>5) Trials should include an assessment of treatment acceptability and functional improvement in all patients with hypochondriasis<BR/>6) There needs to be further investigation of what management strategies are helpful for those with hypochondriasis who are not prepared to engage in psychotherapy.</P>
