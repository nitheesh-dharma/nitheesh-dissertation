<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2008-06-04 11:31:09 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Radiofrequency denervation can relieve pain from neck joints, but may not relieve pain originating from lumbar discs, and its impact on low-back joint pain is uncertain.</P>
<P>Ongoing neck or back pain can be caused by a joint or damaged disc between two vertebral joints. Injections to block these specific joint nerves can pinpoint if this is the source of the pain. Radiofrequency denervation aims to de-activate the nerve responsible by applying electric current to cauterise it (damage with heat).</P>
<P>The review found that radiofrequency denervation can provide short-term pain relief for a small proportion of people with specific joint problems in the neck. There is conflicting evidence about effects for low-back joint pain, and some evidence that it does not relieve pain from low-back disc problems.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-06-04 13:42:09 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The diagnosis of cervical or lumbar zygapophyseal joint pain can only be made by using local anaesthesia to block the nerves supplying the painful joint. There is a lack of effective treatment for chronic zygapophyseal joint pain or discogenic pain. Radiofrequency denervation appears to be an emerging technology, with substantial variation in its use between countries.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To assess the effectiveness of radiofrequency denervation for the treatment of musculoskeletal pain disorders.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>We searched MEDLINE, PsycLIT, and EMBASE from start to February 2002, plus the Cochrane Library 2002, Issue 2. The references of identified articles were checked and three experts in the field of radiofrequency treatment were consulted to identify studies we might have missed. </P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of radiofrequency denervation for musculoskeletal pain disorders, with no language or date restrictions.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Two authors selected RCTs that met predefined inclusion criteria, extracted the data, and assessed the main results and methodological quality of the selected trials, using standardized forms. Qualitative analysis was conducted to evaluate the level of scientific evidence.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>We found only nine articles, reporting on seven relevant RCTs. Six of the seven were considered to be high-quality. The selected trials included 275 randomized patients, 141 of whom received active treatment. One study examined cervical zygapophyseal joint pain, two cervicobrachial pain, three lumbar zygapophyseal joint pain, and one discogenic low-back pain. The study sample sizes were small, follow-up times short, and there were some deficiencies in patient selection, outcome assessments, and statistical analyses. The level of scientific evidence for the short-term effectiveness of radiofrequency denervation was limited for cervical zygapophyseal joint and cervicobrachial pain, and conflicting for lumbar zygapophyseal joint pain. There was limited evidence suggesting that intradiscal radiofrequency thermocoagulation was not effective for discogenic low-back pain.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>The selected trials provide limited evidence that radiofrequency denervation offers short-term relief for chronic neck pain of zygapophyseal joint origin and for chronic cervicobrachial pain; conflicting evidence on the short-term effect of radiofrequency lesioning on pain and disability in chronic low-back pain of zygapophyseal joint origin; and limited evidence that intradiscal radiofrequency thermocoagulation is not effective for chronic discogenic low-back pain. There is a need for further high-quality RCTs with larger patient samples and data on long-term effects, for which current evidence is inconclusive. Furthermore, RCTs are needed in non-spinal indications where radiofrequency denervation is currently used without any scientific evidence.</P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-06-04 13:42:20 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>A major proportion of the adult population has acute low-back pain or neck pain at some stage of life. Although in most patients symptoms tend to resolve with either conservative treatment or without any treatment, there is a substantial group of patients who develop chronic pain (<LINK REF="REF-Croft-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Croft 1998</LINK>). In most cases, the cause of this chronic pain syndrome remains obscure, and there is no specific treatment available. In a large percentage of patients, a degenerated intervertebral disc seems to be the source of chronic low-back pain (<LINK REF="REF-Schwarzer-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schwarzer 1995</LINK>). Studies on nerve blocks indicate that the prevalence of lumbar zygapophyseal joint pain among chronic low-back pain patients ranges from 15 to 40 per cent (<LINK REF="REF-Schwarzer-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schwarzer 1994</LINK>). In about half of the patients with chronic neck pain following whiplash injury, the pain has been estimated to originate in the cervical zygapophyseal joints. It cannot be diagnosed clinically or radiologically, but it can be identified by using placebo-controlled local anaesthesia to block the nerves supplying the painful joint. A controlled trial showed that intra-articular injections of corticosteroids did not particularly affect chronic pain in the cervical zygapophyseal joints (<LINK REF="REF-Barnsley-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barnsley 1994</LINK>). Another treatment that has been advocated is percutaneous radiofrequency (RF) denervation.</P>
<P>Since Shealy published his first article on radiofrequency denervation of the lumbar zygapophyseal joints in 1975 (<LINK REF="STD-Shealy-1975a" TYPE="STUDY">Shealy 1975a</LINK>), the technique has been modified and used with varying results (<LINK REF="REF-Andersen-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Andersen 1987</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Cho-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Cho 1997</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Dreyfuss-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Dreyfuss 2000</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Gocer-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Gocer 1997</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Mehta-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Mehta 1979</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Schaerer-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Schaerer 1978</LINK>). Although the randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are published exclusively for lumbar and cervical pain, radiofrequency denervation is also used for example, in the management of sacroiliac joint pain (<LINK REF="STD-Ferrante-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Ferrante 2001</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Rathmell-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Rathmell 2001</LINK>), thoracic zygapophyseal pain (<LINK REF="STD-Stolker-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Stolker 1993</LINK>), trigeminal neuralgia (<LINK REF="REF-Brisman-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brisman 1997</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kanpolat-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Kanpolat 2001</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Mathews-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Mathews 2000</LINK>), sympathetically maintained pain (<LINK REF="STD-Manchikanti-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Manchikanti 2000</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Rocco-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Rocco 1995</LINK>), cervicogenic headaches (<LINK REF="STD-Sjaastad-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Sjaastad 1995</LINK>), and intercostal neuralgia (<LINK REF="STD-Stolker-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Stolker 1994</LINK>).</P>

<P>The methods for this systematic review are based on current recommendations for the Back Review Group (<LINK REF="REF-van-Tulder-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Tulder 1997</LINK>). We searched MEDLINE, PsycLIT, and EMBASE from their beginning to February 2002. The Cochrane Library 2002, Issue 2 was also searched for recent studies.

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Study selection</HEADING>
<P>Two authors (LN, EK) independently selected the trials that were included in the systematic review. They reviewed the title, keyword, and abstract to determine if the study potentially met the inclusion criteria regarding design, subjects, and intervention. Disagreements were discussed and consensus sought. If they could not be resolved or if it was unclear whether the article should be included, the full article was retrieved for final assessment. The same two authors also assessed the full-text articles to finally decide whether the study met the inclusion criteria. Disagreements were again discussed and if consensus could not be reached, a third author (AM) was consulted.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Data extraction</HEADING>
<P>Two authors (LN, EK) extracted the data independently, using a standardized form. The following types of outcome were considered: pain, global improvement, functional status (disorder-specific and generic), ability to work, health care consumption and costs, and satisfaction with treatment. We considered a study to be positive if radiofrequency denervation was effective in improving at least one of these outcome measures, negative if there was more improvement seen with the reference intervention, or neutral if both interventions had a similar effect on the outcomes.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Assessment of clinical relevance</HEADING>
<P>The assessment of clinical relevance, adapted from Shekelle, et al (<LINK REF="REF-Shekelle-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shekelle 1994</LINK>), evaluated whether the characteristics of the patients, health care setting, and intervention were described precisely enough to allow inferences for clinical applicability of the results, and clinical relevance of the measured outcome. Based on these facts, the same two authors assessed if the evidence was sufficient to support clinical recommendations for each indication.</P>
<P>Three questions were used to assess the clinical relevance. Each relevance item was scored as (+) if the methodological criterion was fulfilled, (-) if the criterion was not fulfilled, and (?) if some of the criteria were fulfilled.</P>
<P>1. Are the patients described in sufficient detail to allow you to decide whether they are comparable to those that you see in your practise?<BR/>1a) Setting<BR/>1a1. Primary, secondary (hospital) or tertiary (specialist in back or neck pain). 1a2. Outpatient or inpatient.<BR/>1b) Patient characteristics<BR/>1b1. Duration of pain. 1b2. Percentage of patients with sciatica. 1b3. Exclusion criteria described.</P>
<P>2. Is the intervention described well enough to enable you to provide the same for your patients?<BR/>2a) In intervention group<BR/>2a1. Therapists. 2a2. Content of intervention. 2a3. Duration and frequency of intervention.<BR/>2b) In control group</P>
<P>3. Were clinically relevant outcomes measured?<BR/>1. Pain. 2. Disorder-specific disability. 3. Ability to work (sickness absence or patient assessment).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Assessment of methodological quality</HEADING>
<P>The same two authors who extracted the data (LN, EK) independently assessed the methodological quality of the trials. A consensus method was used to solve disagreements, and a third author (AM) was consulted in case of disagreement.</P>
<P>We used the criteria list used in other Cochrane reviews for spinal disorders (<LINK REF="REF-van-Tulder-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Tulder 1997</LINK>). The internal validity criteria (n = 10) refer to characteristics of the study that may be related to selection bias (criterion b, c), performance bias (criteria e, f, g and h), attrition bias (criteria l and p) and detection bias (criteria i, j), and should be used to define methodological quality in the meta-analysis. Each quality item was scored as positive (+) if the methodological criterion was fulfilled, negative (-) if the criterion was not fulfilled, and unclear (?) if data were not available.<BR/>1. Treatment allocation:<BR/>a) Was an appropriate method of randomization performed? A random assignment sequence was used.<BR/>b) Was the treatment allocation concealed? Assignment was generated by an independent person not responsible for determining the eligibility of the patients.<BR/>2. Were the groups similar at baseline regarding the most important prognostic indicators? Groups must be similar at baseline regarding age, duration of complaints, percentage of patients with radiating pain, and value of main outcome measure(s).<BR/>3. Was the care provider blinded to the intervention? The author determines when enough information is given about blinding.<BR/>4. Were co-interventions avoided or comparable between the index and control groups?<BR/>5. Was compliance acceptable in all groups? The author determines when compliance with the interventions is acceptable, based on the reported intensity, duration, number, and frequency of sessions.<BR/>6. Was the patient blinded to the intervention?<BR/>7. Was the outcome assessor blinded to the intervention?<BR/>8. Were the outcome measures relevant? For example, for back pain, the level of pain, a global measure of improvement, back-specific functional status, generic functional status, and return-to-work are considered to be relevant.<BR/>9. Was the withdrawal/drop-out rate described and acceptable? Participants included in the study but who did not complete the observation period or were not included in the analysis must be described. If the percentage of drop-outs does not exceed 20% for short-term follow-up and 30% for long-term follow-up and does not lead to substantial bias, a (+) is scored.<BR/>10. Did the analysis include an intention-to-treat analysis? All randomized patients are reported/analyzed for the most important moments of effect measurement (minus missing values) irrespective of non-compliance and co-interventions.</P>
<P>We considered RCTs to be of high methodological quality if at least five out of 10 items of the internal validity criteria scored positively and of low methodological quality if less than five items scored positively. </P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Qualitative analysis</HEADING>
<P>Finally, qualitative analysis was conducted, using a rating system with four levels of scientific evidence for the effectiveness of radio-frequency denervation for each diagnosis (<LINK REF="REF-van-Tulder-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Tulder 2000</LINK>):</P>
<P>Level A: Strong research-based evidence provided by generally consistent findings in multiple high-quality RCTs<BR/>Level B: Moderate research-based evidence provided by generally consistent findings in one high-quality RCT plus one or more low-quality RCTs, or generally consistent findings in multiple low-quality RCTs<BR/>Level C: Limited or conflicting research-based evidence provided by one RCT (either high or low quality) or inconsistent findings in multiple RCTs<BR/>Level D: No research-based evidence i.e. no RCTs</P>
<P>Results were considered to be contradictory if the overall conclusion on effectiveness in different studies on the same indication was contradictory or inconsistent (or if the studies were not comparable with regard to population, intervention, follow-up times and outcomes).</P>

<P>The baseline characteristics of all subjects were similar with regard to age, sex of the patients, and duration of pain in all except one study, where they were not described precisely (<LINK REF="STD-Gallagher-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Gallagher 1994</LINK>). Only one study used double-blinded placebo-controlled local anaesthetic blocks to identify the source of pain, while the other six used simple local anaesthetic blocks. Some differences were apparent in the operative technique, but otherwise the intervention was similar across the studies. The procedure was double-blinded in all except Leclaire's studies (<LINK REF="STD-Leclaire-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Leclaire 2001</LINK>), with variation in the outcome measures, follow-up periods, and statistical analysis. Pain intensity (visual analogue scale, VAS 0-10) was measured in all and the McGill Pain Questionnaire used in three (<LINK REF="STD-Gallagher-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Gallagher 1994</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Lord-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Lord 1996</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-van-Kleef-1996a" TYPE="STUDY">van Kleef 1996a</LINK>) of the studies. The ability to work or return to work was assessed in only one study (<LINK REF="STD-Leclaire-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Leclaire 2001</LINK>), and disorder-specific functional status and generic functional status were assessed in three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Barendse-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Barendse 2001</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Leclaire-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Leclaire 2001</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-van-Kleef-1999" TYPE="STUDY">van Kleef 1999</LINK>). All seven trials were published in English, within the last eight years. Four trials were conducted in the Netherlands (<LINK REF="STD-Barendse-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Barendse 2001</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Slappendel-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Slappendel 1997</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-van-Kleef-1996a" TYPE="STUDY">van Kleef 1996a</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-van-Kleef-1999" TYPE="STUDY">van Kleef 1999</LINK>), one in the United Kingdom (<LINK REF="STD-Gallagher-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Gallagher 1994</LINK>), one in Australia (<LINK REF="STD-Lord-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Lord 1996</LINK>), and one in Canada (<LINK REF="STD-Leclaire-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Leclaire 2001</LINK>).

<P>One RCT by van Kleef (<LINK REF="STD-van-Kleef-1996a" TYPE="STUDY">van Kleef 1996a</LINK>) and one RCT reported in two publications (<LINK REF="STD-Slappendel-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Slappendel 1997</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Samwel-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Samwel 2000</LINK>) on chronic cervicobrachial pain were included. The study population in van Kleef's study (n = 20) included patients with chronic unilateral cervicobrachial pain of more than 12 months' duration and unilateral tenderness to direct palpation in the mid- and lower regions of the cervical spine, and/or pain provocation to direct palpation of the trapezius muscle, and the absence of a definite, surgically remediable abnormality in diagnostic imaging studies that could have been the cause of pain. After diagnostic segmental nerve blocks, the level that provided more than 50 per cent pain relief to the patient was selected for treatment. The radiofrequency lesion was induced adjacent to the dorsal root ganglion at 67°C for 60 seconds. In the control group, electrodes were introduced as in the radiofrequency lesion group, but no radiofrequency lesions were induced. Both the pain intensity and severity were assessed. A reduction of two points or more on the VAS scale was considered to be a clinically important reduction of pain, which was based on the authors experience. The follow-up period was eight weeks, after which patients who claimed no pain relief and had received sham lesions could undergo radiofrequency procedures if they desired.</P>
<P>The study population in Slappendel's study (n = 61) included patients aged 20 to 60 years who were suffering from chronic benign unilateral pain in the neck, shoulder or arm of at least six months' duration with no effect of conventional therapeutic approaches. The authors judged a diagnostic block to be positive if it was followed by pain relief of at least three points on the VAS scale for a minimum of one hour and when the blockades of two adjacent roots yielded less pain relief. A 90-second radiofrequency lesion was applied adjacent to the dorsal root ganglion. In Group I, a temperature of 67°C and in Group II, 40°C temperature was applied. Mean pain intensity was assessed at baseline, at six weeks, and at three-month follow-up.</P>

<P>One RCT reported in two separate publications (<LINK REF="STD-Lord-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Lord 1996</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Wallis-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Wallis 1997</LINK>) on chronic cervical zygapophyseal joint pain was included. The study population in Lord's study (n = 24) included patients with chronic zygapophyseal joint pain in one or more joints after an automobile accident. The median duration of pain was 34 months. The source of the pain had been identified with the use of double-blinded, placebo-controlled local anaesthesia. The patient's perception of pain was considered confirmed only if the patient showed complete relief of pain each time a local anaesthetic was used, but no relief when normal saline was used. The operative technique was well described. The radiofrequency lesion was induced at 80°C for 90 seconds. In the control group, electrodes were introduced as in the radiofrequency lesion group, but no radiofrequency lesion was induced. For the treatment to be considered successful, the patient had to report complete relief from the pain for which he or she was being treated, and the restoration of all four activities of daily living that the patient had listed before the procedure. The treatment was considered to have failed if the patient reported no relief from the accustomed pain immediately after the operation or when the pain returned to at least 50 per cent of its preoperative level (<LINK REF="REF-Barnsley-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barnsley 1994</LINK>). Both the pain intensity and psychological status were assessed. After the three-month interview, patients who reported either no relief or an early return of their pain were offered `escape´ therapy in the form of percutaneous radiofrequency denervation. Patients who showed pain relief for more than three months postoperatively were asked to call the study investigator as soon as their pain returned to at least 50 per cent of the preoperative level. In addition, the patients were formally interviewed at 12 months and yearly thereafter, as long as their complete relief lasted.</P>

<P>Three RCTs on chronic zygapophyseal joint pain were included (<LINK REF="STD-van-Kleef-1999" TYPE="STUDY">van Kleef 1999</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Gallagher-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Gallagher 1994</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Leclaire-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Leclaire 2001</LINK>). The study population in van Kleef's study (n = 31) included patients with chronic low-back pain of more than 12 months duration and who obtained at least 50 per cent pain relief from a diagnostic dorsal ramus nerve block with a local anaesthetic solution. The study population in Gallagher's study (n = 41) included patients with low-back pain of longer than three months duration, fulfilled the criteria for facet-joint pain, and showed either good or equivocal response to local anaesthetic injection into and around the appropriate painful joints. The inclusion criteria in Leclaire's study (n = 70) were patients with chronic low-back pain of longer than three months duration, who experienced significant pain relief for at least 24 hours during the week after intra-articular facet injection. Gallagher used the original Shealy technique, Van Kleef and Leclaire the modified version, but they all induced a radiofrequency lesion at 80°C for 60 to 90 seconds. In the control group, electrodes were introduced as in the radiofrequency lesion group, but no radiofrequency lesion was induced. Pain intensity was reported in all of the studies. Van Kleef and Leclaire assessed disorder-specific outcomes, whereas van Kleef also assessed generic functional status. The follow-up time in Gallagher's study was six months, in van Kleef's study two months, and in Leclaire's study three months.</P>

A 90-second 70°C radiofrequency lesion was made to the centre of the disc. The sham group was treated in an identical way, but no radiofrequency current was applied. Pain intensity, disability, analgesic intake, and quality of life were monitored before the treatment and eight weeks after. The treatment was scored as a success for patients with at least a two-point reduction on the VAS scale and at least a 50 per cent pain reduction on global perceived effect. Patients who did not experience success were offered further treatment, for example, a pain management program or clinical rehabilitation.</P>

<P>The intervention group in van Kleef's study (<LINK REF="STD-van-Kleef-1996a" TYPE="STUDY">van Kleef 1996a</LINK>) showed a reduction of the VAS mean from 6.4 to 3.3, compared with the control group increase from 5.9 to 6.0 (p = 0.01). The intervention group also showed greater changes in the subjective pain severity (Multidimensional Pain Inventory) with -1.7 (SD 1.8) compared with the control group of -0.1 (SD 1.4 ; p = 0.02) and in the total pain rating index (McGill Pain Questionnaire) with -11.2 (SD 12.7) compared with the control group of -0.4 (SD 11.2 ; p = 0.03).</P>
<P>In Slappendel's study (<LINK REF="STD-Slappendel-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Slappendel 1997</LINK>), Group I (67°C) showed a reduction of the VAS mean from 6.7 (SD 1.6) to 4.8 (SD 3.5) at six weeks and an increase to 5.0 (SD 2.9) at three month follow-up. In Group II (40°C), the VAS mean decreased from 6.3 (SD 2.1) to 4.9 (SD 2.7) at six weeks and to 4.4 (SD 2.9) at three months. The differences between the groups were not statistically significant. None of the psychological variables (pain cognition, negative self-efficacy and catastrophizing, physical and psychosocial dysfunction, and overall distress) showed any significant changes after treatment. Changes in pain intensity after radiofrequency were positively correlated with changes in psychosocial dysfunction and negative self-efficacy (<LINK REF="STD-Samwel-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Samwel 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>The authors concluded that there was limited evidence that radiofrequency denervation exerted a positive short-term effect on patients with cervicobrachial pain when the neurological deficits, signs of radicular compression, or extensive degenerative changes were controlled for. There was limited evidence that high-temperature (67°C) radiofrequency lesioning was equally effective to the low-temperature (40°C) procedure. The long-term effect remained unclear.</P>

<P>In the study by Lord (<LINK REF="STD-Lord-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Lord 1996</LINK>), six patients (50%) in the control group and three (25%) in the intervention group returned to their accustomed level of pain immediately after the operation. By 27 weeks, one patient in the control group and seven in the active-treatment group remained free of pain. The median time to return of at least 50 per cent of the preoperative level of pain was 263 days in the intervention group and eight days in the control group (p = 0.04). At three months, all patients who were pain-free (n = 9), irrespective of treatment received, exhibited resolution of psychological distress. Only one patient of the eight whose pain was present at three months exhibited improvement in her level of psychological distress (<LINK REF="STD-Wallis-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Wallis 1997</LINK>).</P>

<P>At two-month follow-up in van Kleef's study (<LINK REF="STD-van-Kleef-1999" TYPE="STUDY">van Kleef 1999</LINK>), the intervention group showed greater reductions in the VAS mean: -2.4 compared with the control group's -0.4 (p&lt;0.05); in the VAS high: -3.6 compared with the control group's -1.0 (p&lt;0.01); in the VAS low: -1.8 compared with the control group's +0.5 (p&lt;0.01); and in the Oswestry Disability scale: -11.1 compared with the control group's +1.7 (p&lt;0.05). Also at two-month follow-up, the reported percentage of success (more than a two-point reduction on the VAS scale and greater than 50 per cent reduction in global perceived effect) for the intervention group was 67 per cent and for the control group 37.5 per cent (p = 0.003). At four-week follow-up in Leclaire's (<LINK REF="STD-Leclaire-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Leclaire 2001</LINK>) study, the intervention group showed greater improvement in the Roland-Morris mean score: -8.4 compared with -2.2 in the control group (p = 0.05), but no significant treatment effect was seen in either the Oswestry score (0.6% change) or in the VAS score (4.2% change). At 12 weeks, neither functional disability nor pain level showed any treatment effect.</P>
<P>The authors' conclusion was that radiofrequency denervation had a positive short-term effect in van Kleef's study (<LINK REF="STD-van-Kleef-1999" TYPE="STUDY">van Kleef 1999</LINK>), but a neutral effect in Leclaire's (<LINK REF="STD-Leclaire-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Leclaire 2001</LINK>) study. The result of Gallagher's study (<LINK REF="STD-Gallagher-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Gallagher 1994</LINK>) remained unclear since they included no intention-to-treat analyses.

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Clinical relevance of the included studies:</HEADING>
<P>The instrument we chose was used in earlier systematic reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Guzman-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guzman 2001</LINK>), where it was shown to be discriminative and responsive. However, it was not very discriminative in our review because all of the authors described the interventions in an acceptable way, although there were some differences in the surgical technique used (See <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>). In studies dealing with low-back pain, the setting from which the patients were recruited (primary or secondary care) and patient characteristics were adequately described in all but Gallagher's study (<LINK REF="STD-Gallagher-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Gallagher 1994</LINK>). In only one study was the condition verified with placebo-controlled local anaesthetic blocks (<LINK REF="STD-Lord-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Lord 1996</LINK>). Shortcomings were found in all studies concerning the description of outcome measures. All of the authors assessed pain intensity and severity, but only van Kleef (<LINK REF="STD-van-Kleef-1999" TYPE="STUDY">van Kleef 1999</LINK>) and Barendse (<LINK REF="STD-Barendse-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Barendse 2001</LINK>) assessed functional disability, physical impairment, quality of life, consumption of analgesics, and more specific pain intensity (VAS mean, high and low). No study group assessed pain intensity at rest/in movement. Only <LINK REF="STD-Wallis-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Wallis 1997</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Samwel-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Samwel 2000</LINK> assessed psychological status in the studies dealing with cervical zygapophyseal joint pain and cervicobrachial pain. Only Leclaire (<LINK REF="STD-Leclaire-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Leclaire 2001</LINK>) assessed ability to work (sickness absence or return to work) and conducted an analysis of co-interventions.</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2008-06-04 11:38:26 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The objective of this systematic review was to assess the level of evidence in various pain indications based on the information provided by RCTs. Despite an extensive literature search, we found only nine articles, reporting on seven RCTs, six of which were considered to be high-quality studies (<LINK REF="REF-van-Tulder-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Tulder 1997</LINK>), even though they all had some deficiencies that will be discussed below. All studies used the double-blinded principle, which naturally increased the methodological quality of the studies. The short-term effects were positive in three of the high-quality studies and neutral in the other three. The evidence for radiofrequency denervation in chronic cervicobrachial pain would have been conflicting if the low temperature (40°C) procedure had been considered a sham treatment and two studies had been analyzed together.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Patients</HEADING>
<P>From a methodological perspective, the small number of patients in each trial was a shortcoming. The overall number of patients in all seven studies was 275, 141 of whom received active treatment. However, from a clinical perspective, due to the specialized, invasiveness of the technique and exposure to x-ray, the small number of patients was appropriate.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Diagnostic blocks</HEADING>
<P>Since the rate of false-positive effects would otherwise be high (<LINK REF="STD-Lord-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Lord 1996</LINK>), diagnostic blocks should be performed using placebo controls. Yet, only Lord's study used double-blinded placebo-controlled local anaesthetic blocks to confirm the origin of pain. Patients had to report complete pain relief each time a local anaesthetic was used, but no relief when normal saline was used, in order for the procedure to be considered a success. The other six studies used simple local anaesthetic blocks and accepted less pain relief for a positive outcome.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Outcome measures</HEADING>
<P>The evaluation criteria varied; only Lord's study (<LINK REF="STD-Lord-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Lord 1996</LINK>) considered treatment to be successful if the relief of pain was complete. Van Kleef's study (<LINK REF="STD-van-Kleef-1996a" TYPE="STUDY">van Kleef 1996a</LINK>) considered treatment to be successful if reduction on the VAS scale was two points or more. Van Kleef's and Barendse's studies (<LINK REF="STD-van-Kleef-1999" TYPE="STUDY">van Kleef 1999</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Barendse-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Barendse 2001</LINK>) scored the treatment as a success with at least a two-point reduction on the VAS scale and at least a 50 per cent pain reduction on global perceived effect. However, the significance of the two-point reduction on the VAS scale has not been clinically validated. Both point estimates and measures of variability were reported in all but Lord's study, in which they reported the median time to a return of at least 50 per cent of the pre-operative level of pain. An intention-to-treat analysis was included in all but Gallagher's and Slappendel's studies (<LINK REF="STD-Gallagher-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Gallagher 1994</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Slappendel-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Slappendel 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>Van Kleef (<LINK REF="STD-van-Kleef-1999" TYPE="STUDY">van Kleef 1999</LINK>) and Barendse (<LINK REF="STD-Barendse-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Barendse 2001</LINK>) split the VAS scale into mean, high, and low scores, which was more descriptive. However, it would have been appropriate to also include VAS at rest and in movement.</P>
<P>The use of analgesics and changes in their use along with the treatment would also be an important outcome measure in studies focusing on pain patients. Only van Kleef (<LINK REF="STD-van-Kleef-1999" TYPE="STUDY">van Kleef 1999</LINK>) and Barendse (<LINK REF="STD-Barendse-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Barendse 2001</LINK>) reported changes in the use of analgesics. Only Leclaire (<LINK REF="STD-Leclaire-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Leclaire 2001</LINK>) reported the use of any escape medications or other non-pharmacologic treatments.</P>
<P>Only Leclaire's study (<LINK REF="STD-Leclaire-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Leclaire 2001</LINK>) fulfilled all the clinically relevant outcome measures, which are considered to be pain, disorder-specific disability, and ability to work. Van Kleef's, Barendse's, Lord's, and Slappendel's studies (<LINK REF="STD-van-Kleef-1999" TYPE="STUDY">van Kleef 1999</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Barendse-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Barendse 2001</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Lord-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Lord 1996</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Slappendel-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Slappendel 1997</LINK>) studies fulfilled two criteria, which were pain and disorder-specific disability. Van Kleef (<LINK REF="STD-van-Kleef-1996a" TYPE="STUDY">van Kleef 1996a</LINK>) and Gallagher (<LINK REF="STD-Gallagher-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Gallagher 1994</LINK>) used pain as the only outcome measure.</P>
<P>None of the studies included any health economic considerations.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Adverse effects</HEADING>
<P>There were no reported adverse effects in van Kleef's (<LINK REF="STD-van-Kleef-1996a" TYPE="STUDY">van Kleef 1996a</LINK>), Gallagher's (<LINK REF="STD-Gallagher-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Gallagher 1994</LINK>), Barendse's (<LINK REF="STD-Barendse-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Barendse 2001</LINK>), or Leclaire's (<LINK REF="STD-Leclaire-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Leclaire 2001</LINK>) studies. Lord (<LINK REF="STD-Lord-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Lord 1996</LINK>) and van Kleef (<LINK REF="STD-van-Kleef-1996a" TYPE="STUDY">van Kleef 1996a</LINK>) reported some subsiding pain and numbness associated with the procedure. The symptoms were more common and lasted longer in the radio-frequency lesion group. Slappendel (<LINK REF="STD-Slappendel-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Slappendel 1997</LINK>) reported complaints of subsiding neuritis and slight loss of muscle strength in the hand or arm on the treated side. There were, however, no permanent complications reported.</P>
<P>
<B>Follow-up</B>
<BR/>The follow-up time for intention-to-treat analysis was eight weeks in both van Kleef's (<LINK REF="STD-van-Kleef-1996a" TYPE="STUDY">van Kleef 1996a</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-van-Kleef-1999" TYPE="STUDY">van Kleef 1999</LINK>) and Barendse's (<LINK REF="STD-Barendse-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Barendse 2001</LINK>) studies and three months in Lord's (<LINK REF="STD-Lord-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Lord 1996</LINK>), Leclaire's (<LINK REF="STD-Leclaire-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Leclaire 2001</LINK>), and Slappendel's (<LINK REF="STD-Slappendel-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Slappendel 1997</LINK>) studies, after which the code was broken and an escape treatment was offered. The escape treatment included radiofrequency denervation in Lord's, van Kleef's (<LINK REF="STD-van-Kleef-1996a" TYPE="STUDY">van Kleef 1996a</LINK>), Leclaire's, and Slappendel's studies and clinical rehabilitation in van Kleef's (<LINK REF="STD-van-Kleef-1999" TYPE="STUDY">van Kleef 1999</LINK>) and Barendse's studies. Although the number of successes was reported after breaking the code in Lord's, van Kleef's (<LINK REF="STD-van-Kleef-1999" TYPE="STUDY">van Kleef 1999</LINK>), and Barendse's studies, the small number of patients appears inadequate for drawing conclusions on long-term effects.</P>
<P>Longer follow-up periods are needed, not only for proof of efficacy in radiofrequency denervation, but also to track eventual long-term adverse effects.</P>

<P> (See <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>)<BR/>The studies reviewed provided limited evidence that radiofrequency denervation can offer short-term relief of pain in chronic neck pain of zygapophyseal joint origin and in chronic cervicobrachial pain among preselected individuals. There is limited evidence that the effects of high-temperature (67°C) radiofrequency lesioning of the cervical dorsal root ganglion are not different from those of the low-temperature (40°C) procedure for cervicobrachial pain. There is conflicting evidence on the short-term effect of radiofrequency lesioning on pain and disability in chronic low-back pain of zygapophyseal joint origin. There is limited evidence that intradiscal radiofrequency thermocoagulation is not effective in relieving chronic discogenic low-back pain. </P>
<P>In conclusion, short-term favourable outcomes can be expected from radiofrequency denervation among preselected individuals with chronic neck pain. However, radiofrequency denervation is a demanding, invasive method, liable to complications in unskilled hands, and requires special equipment and skilled staff.</P>

<FEEDBACK_SUMMARY MODIFIED="2008-06-04 12:03:07 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The paper by Leclaire R, Fortin L, Lambert R, Bergeron YM, Rossignol M regarding lumbar radiofrequency treatment should not be included in the Cochrane review. Indeed, it may well should not have been published, as it commented upon radiofrequency treatment for facet joint pain diagnosed by facet joint injection. The studies that describe the efficacy of radiofrequency treatment specifically had pointed out that response to facet joint injection was NOT a diagnostic test, and that injection of local anaesthetic is the test (with the target point being the nerve supply of the joint, but NOT the joint).</P>
<P>This result skewed the results of radiofrequency in controlled studies (of the facet joints).</P>
<P>Thus, the report is inaccurate.</P>
<P>Additionally, as far as radiofrequency of the facet joint goes, it produces according to the best RCTs a better than 50% improvement of pain for periods over 270 days (interquartile range up to 700 days). This is hardly "short term".</P>
<P>I consider the reviewers remarks therefore to be faulty in that they have probably accepted a paper (see above) that they should not have - and I apologise for all of this if they left it out - and that the term "short-term" is pejorative and inaccurate - where ae there better figures in musculoskeletal pain?</P>
</FEEDBACK_SUMMARY>
<FEEDBACK_REPLY>
<P>- submitted by Dr Leena Niemistö, 1st author<BR/>We thank the author for the interest on our review.[1] </P>
<P>Musculoskeletal pain disorders are the most common cause of chronic pain and radiofrequency denervation (RD) is becoming increasingly popular in treatment of various chronic pain conditions. Our systematic review was designed to find out the available evidence for the effectiveness of RD in musculoskeletal pain disorders. </P>
<P>The study by Lord et al [2] was well designed and performed, and yielded high scores for internal validity. The indication was a specific subgroup of patients having cervical zygapophysial joint pain after whiplash injury. The trial showed in a small number of patients (N = 12 in each treatment arm) that if the diagnosis is carefully localized to the medial branch of the cervical dorsal ramus by three local anaesthetic blocks and the RD is performed by experienced specialists, good results for at least three months can be achieved. However, conclusions for the long-term effectiveness of RD on cervical zygapophysial joint pain are not justified as the blinded follow-up period was only three months in the control group, (after which time point the code for blinding was broken). Additional concerns regarding this trial are due to the very small number of patients, and lack of replication in another setting rendering the strength of evidence limited. The generalizability of the trial is difficult to evaluate because of the strict eligibility criteria including three anaesthetic blocks. There is no evidence on how many of the whiplash patients with cervical pain actually fall into this category. </P>
<P>As we stated in our review, diagnostic blocks should be performed using placebo controls. Lord et al 3 showed that there were individuals who had positive response using comparative anaesthetics, but also with the placebo injection. They concluded that it is necessary to use saline placebo-controls before considering any invasive form of therapy, in order to be certain of the source of pain. There were no other studies on cervical or lumbar zygapophysial joint pain that applied this gold standard for diagnosis. Yet we know that clinical practice often differs from scientific gold standard. There are plenty of pain clinics that use intra-articular zygapophysial blocks to make a diagnosis and perform a radiofrequency lesion of the medial branch of dorsal ramus, as in the study by Leclaire et al.4 As it was otherwise methodologically very high-quality study, we had no reason to exclude it from our review. </P>
<P>We recognize the responsibility in performing a systematic review, and have carried out the review according to the recent guidelines of the Cochrane Collaboration. Our clinical backgrounds are in musculoskeletal medicine and pain management; we have discussed the patient selection and surgical techniques with experts in RD, and are familiar with the actual procedure.</P>
<P>We do not have any vested interest in this topic. Our aim has been to provide up-to-date high-class evidence for the efficacy or effectiveness of RD in musculoskeletal disorders. Scientific evidence is one of the pillars on which health policy decisions are based upon.</P>
