<SUMMARY>
<TITLE>There is little evidence to support the use of drugs to improve outcomes in adults with lung injury</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>In adults, direct lung damage or indirect damage caused by trauma, infection or other factors can result in acute lung injury, including acute respiratory distress syndrome. Patients with this syndrome require mechanical ventilation. About half of patients die, and survivors have a prolonged stay in intensive care and physical limitations afterwards. Many drugs have been studied to improve lung function and reduce inflammation in these patients. The evidence to date does not convincingly show that any drug saves lives, although some small studies have shown potential benefit.</P>
</SUMMARY_BODY>
</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Multiple pharmacologic treatments have been studied for acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>Our objective was to determine the effects of pharmacologic treatments on clinical outcomes in adults with ALI or ARDS.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>We searched OVID versions of CENTRAL (<I>The Cochrane Library</I> Issue 3, 2003), MEDLINE (1966 to week 2, January 2004), EMBASE (1980 to week 4, 2004), CINAHL (1982 to week 2, January 2004), and HEALTHSTAR (1995 to December 2003); proceedings from four conferences (1994 to 2003); and bibliographies of review articles and included studies.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomized controlled trials of pharmacologic treatments compared to no therapy or placebo for established ALI or ARDS in adults admitted to an intensive care unit, with measurement of early mortality (primary outcome), late mortality, duration of mechanical ventilation, ventilator-free days to day 28, or adverse events. We excluded trials of nitric oxide, partial liquid ventilation, fluid and nutritional interventions, oxygen, and trials in other populations reporting outcomes in subgroups of patients with ALI or ARDS.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Two reviewers independently screened titles and abstracts, rated studies for inclusion, extracted data and assessed methodologic quality of included studies. Disagreements were resolved by consensus in consultation with a third reviewer. For each pharmacologic therapy, we quantitatively pooled the results of studies using random effects models where permitted by the available data. We contacted study authors when clarification of the primary outcome was required.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Thirty three trials randomizing 3272 patients met our inclusion criteria. Pooling of results showed no effect on early mortality of prostaglandin E<SUB>1</SUB> (seven trials randomizing 697 patients; relative risk [RR] 0.95, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.77 to 1.17), N-acetylcysteine (five trials randomizing 239 patients; RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.21), early high-dose corticosteroids (two trials randomizing 187 patients; RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.74), or surfactant (nine trials randomizing 1441 patients; RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.12). Two interventions were beneficial in single small trials; corticosteroids given for late phase ARDS reduced hospital mortality (24 patients; RR 0.20, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.81), and pentoxifylline reduced one-month mortality (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.47 to 0.95) in 30 patients with metastatic cancer and ARDS. Individual trials of nine additional interventions failed to show a beneficial effect on prespecified outcomes.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>Effective pharmacotherapy for ALI and ARDS is extremely limited, with insufficient evidence to support any specific intervention.</P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-08-02 12:52:11 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Karen Hovhannisyan">
<P>The acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), first described in 1967 (<LINK REF="REF-Ashbaugh-1967" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ashbaugh 1967</LINK>), is characterized by diffuse inflammation of the lung's alveolar-capillary membrane in response to various pulmonary and extrapulmonary insults (<LINK REF="REF-Ware-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ware 2000</LINK>). These insults cause pulmonary injury by direct (for example, gastric aspiration, pneumonia, inhalational injury, pulmonary contusion) or indirect (for example, sepsis, trauma, pancreatitis, multiple transfusions of blood products) mechanisms. An American-European Consensus Conference (AECC) (<LINK REF="REF-Bernard-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bernard 1994</LINK>) formulated a widely cited definition of ARDS as follows: an acute onset of (1) hypoxaemia, with a ratio of the partial pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO<SUB>2</SUB>) to the inspired fraction of oxygen (FiO<SUB>2</SUB>) of 200 mmHg or less, (2) bilateral infiltrates on a frontal chest radiograph, and (3) no clinical evidence of left atrial hypertension or a pulmonary artery occlusion pressure of 18 mmHg or less in the presence of a pulmonary artery catheter. Acute lung injury (ALI) includes a milder form of lung injury, with a PaO<SUB>2</SUB>/FiO<SUB>2</SUB> ratio of 300 mmHg or less. Almost all patients with ARDS and most with ALI require mechanical ventilation to survive; all require supplemental oxygen. The mortality of ARDS is high, estimated to be between 34% and 60% (<LINK REF="REF-Ware-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ware 2000</LINK>). In addition, survivors have a prolonged stay in the intensive care unit (ICU) and demonstrate significant functional limitations, primarily fatigue and muscle weakness, that reduce quality of life after hospital discharge (<LINK REF="REF-Herridge-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Herridge 2003</LINK>). </P>
<P>Research on therapy for ARDS has focused on both mechanical ventilation strategies and pharmacologic interventions. Animal and clinical studies, including randomized controlled trials (RCTs), have demonstrated the role of mechanical ventilation in perpetuating lung injury (<LINK REF="REF-Dos-Santos-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dos Santos 2000</LINK>), leading to macroscopic damage (for example, pneumothorax), diffuse ventilator-induced lung injury, and multiple organ system failure (<LINK REF="REF-Murphy-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Murphy 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ranieri-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ranieri 1999</LINK>). Several RCTs have compared lung protective (pressure and volume limited) to traditional strategies of mechanical ventilation (<LINK REF="REF-Amato-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Amato 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-ARDS-Network-2000a" TYPE="REFERENCE">ARDS Network 2000a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Brochard-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brochard 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Brower-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brower 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stewart-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stewart 1998</LINK>). The largest and most recent study (<LINK REF="REF-ARDS-Network-2000a" TYPE="REFERENCE">ARDS Network 2000a</LINK>) was stopped early after a planned interim analysis showed a statistically significant reduction in hospital mortality from 39.8 percent to 31.0 percent (p = 0.007) in the group receiving low compared to traditional tidal volumes. The results of this trial have convinced many clinicians and investigators that lung protective ventilation using low tidal volumes and low inflation pressures is the most important therapeutic intervention available for patients with ARDS and ALI. </P>
<P>The pathogenesis of ARDS, extensively reviewed elsewhere (<LINK REF="REF-Luce-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Luce 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ware-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ware 2000</LINK>), provides multiple potential targets for pharmacologic interventions. Regardless of the inciting insult, the pathology of ARDS features damage to the alveolar-capillary membrane, with leakage of protein-rich edema fluid into alveoli. Epithelial damage involves the basement membrane and types I and II cells. Injury reduces the amount and function of surfactant produced by type II cells. This increases alveolar surface tension, decreases lung compliance, and causes atelectasis. Endothelial damage is associated with numerous inflammatory events. These include neutrophil recruitment, sequestration and activation; formation of oxygen radicals; activation of the coagulation system, leading to microvascular thrombosis with platelet-fibrin thrombi; and recruitment of mesenchymal cells with production of procollagen (a precursor to fibrosing alveolitis). Within the alveolar space, the balance between pro-inflammatory (for example, tumour necrosis factor [TNF] alpha and interleukins [IL] 1, 6, and 8) and anti-inflammatory mediators (for example, IL-1 receptor antagonist and soluble TNF receptor) favours ongoing inflammation. In summary, initial lung injury is followed by repair, remodelling, and fibrosing alveolitis. </P>
<P>The diversity of approaches to pharmacologic therapy for ALI and ARDS reflects the complex pathophysiology. Therapies evaluated in randomized trials in humans include corticosteroids, other anti-inflammatory agents, immunomodulating agents, pulmonary vasodilators, antioxidants, and surfactants. These therapies have multiple proposed mechanisms of action (<LINK REF="REF-Brower-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brower 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Dos-Santos-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dos Santos 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>). They have not been evaluated in a systematic review, with the exception of inhaled nitric oxide (<LINK REF="REF-Sokol-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sokol 2002</LINK>). </P>
<P>Another version of this review: 'Pharmacologic treatments for the acute respiratory distress syndrome and acute lung injury: systematic review and meta-analysis' (<LINK REF="REF-Adhikari-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Adhikari 2004</LINK>) is in press in <I>Treatments in Respiratory Medicine</I>.</P>

<CRIT_STUDIES>
<P>We reviewed randomized controlled trials (RCTs), either published in full or in abstract form. We excluded quasi-randomized trials.

<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>We included adult patients with ALI or ARDS admitted to an ICU. We used authors' definitions of adult, ALI, and ARDS.</P>
</CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>We included any pharmacologic therapy compared to placebo or no therapy for the treatment of established ALI or ARDS, including any pharmacologic therapy given for the treatment of established ALI that may prevent the development of ARDS. We did not consider studies of enteral and intravenous therapies that are either not considered to be pharmacologic by regulatory authorities (nutritional interventions) or are combined with other management strategies (fluid management). We also did not consider inhaled nitric oxide (previously reviewed [<LINK REF="REF-Sokol-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sokol 2002</LINK>]), pharmacologic therapies used as part of a strategy of mechanical ventilation (partial liquid ventilation), or medical oxygen. We excluded any pharmacologic therapy started for prophylaxis of ALI, even when continued in patients who subsequently developed ALI or ARDS. We excluded studies directly comparing two pharmacologic therapies without a no treatment or placebo group.</P>

For quantitative comparisons, treatment and control groups were compared using relative risk (RR) for categorical outcomes and weighted mean difference (WMD) for continuous outcomes. For studies reporting more than one treatment arm differing in medication dose, we combined data from all doses to determine an overall outcome measure for the treatment group. In all analyses we used the random effects model (<LINK REF="REF-DerSimonian-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">DerSimonian 1986</LINK>) in Review Manager 4.2 (<LINK REF="REF-Review-Manager-4.2" TYPE="REFERENCE">Review Manager 4.2</LINK>) because this method generally produces more conservative estimates of the precision of the treatment effect than the fixed effect model (<LINK REF="REF-Montori-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Montori 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>For each pooled comparison, homogeneity of treatment effect was estimated using the Q statistic (<LINK REF="REF-Cochran-1954" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cochran 1954</LINK>). We considered p &#8804; 0.05 to be significant for the test of overall treatment effect and p &#8804; 0.10 to be significant for the test of homogeneity. When statistically significant heterogeneity was found, we aggregated results using the random effects model only if studies were clinically similar. Results of studies with major clinical dissimilarities as judged by the reviewers were not pooled but were qualitatively summarized. We also used the recently described I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic when assessing the impact of statistical heterogeneity on study results (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2002</LINK>). This statistic is independent of the number of studies pooled and denotes the proportion of total variance in individual study estimates of treatment effect that arises from between-study heterogeneity. We considered values of I<SUP>2</SUP> greater than 50% to represent substantial between-study heterogeneity (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>We constructed funnel plots to assess for the potential of publication bias when pooled analyses contained at least five studies.</P>
<P>For each pharmacologic therapy we conducted the following additional analyses for the outcomes of early mortality, late mortality, duration of mechanical ventilation, and ventilator-free days to day 28:</P>
<OL>
<LI>Subgroup analysis of the treatment effect in patients with ALI not meeting criteria for ARDS compared to those with ARDS;</LI>
<LI>Sensitivity analysis of treatment effect in trials with adequate allocation concealment compared to all trials;</LI>
<LI>Sensitivity analysis of treatment effect in trials with balanced cointerventions (reported or applied according to protocol) in treatment and control groups compared to all trials.</LI>
</OL>
<P>For each analysis, we statistically tested the difference in estimates of treatment effect between the two groups using a z test (<LINK REF="REF-Fleiss-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fleiss 1993</LINK>) and considered p &#8804; 0.05 to be statistically significant.<BR/>

<P>Searches of electronic databases yielded 5705 citations for screening. From these citations, conference abstracts, and bibliographies of retrieved studies, we identified 75 potentially relevant publications of which 33 met our inclusion criteria. We excluded 39 publications (see "Table of characteristics of excluded studies"), in addition to two duplicate publications (<LINK REF="REF-Holcroft-1986b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Holcroft 1986b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shoemaker-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shoemaker 1987</LINK>) and one probable duplicate publication (<LINK REF="REF-Wiedemann-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wiedemann 1992</LINK>).</P>
<P>The 33 included publications described 33 studies. Two studies of surfactant (<LINK REF="STD-Spragg-2002a" TYPE="STUDY">Spragg 2002a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Spragg-2002b" TYPE="STUDY">Spragg 2002b</LINK>) were reported in one abstract. One publication (<LINK REF="STD-Bernard-1997a" TYPE="STUDY">Bernard 1997a</LINK>) reported a trial of patients randomized to receive N-acetylcysteine (NAC), procysteine, or placebo. We included the patients randomized to NAC and placebo in a pooled analysis of the effect of NAC on early mortality and described the procysteine arm separately. Another study of NAC (<LINK REF="STD-Ortolani-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Ortolani 2000</LINK>) randomized patients to NAC, NAC plus rutin (a flavanoid antioxidant), or control. We combined data from both NAC groups in our pooled analysis and did not analyse the effect of rutin, which we classified as a nutritional supplement. Finally, one study of prostaglandin E<SUB>1</SUB> (PGE<SUB>1</SUB>) reported mortality data in 147 randomized patients (<LINK REF="REF-Slotman-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Slotman 1992</LINK>), of whom clinical outcomes in 101 patients had been previously published (<LINK REF="REF-Bone-1989b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bone 1989b</LINK>). We counted these two publications as one study (<LINK REF="STD-Bone-1989a" TYPE="STUDY">Bone 1989a</LINK>) and extracted data on early mortality from the later publication (<LINK REF="REF-Slotman-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Slotman 1992</LINK>) and data on methodology, late mortality and adverse events from the earlier publication (<LINK REF="REF-Bone-1989b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bone 1989b</LINK>).

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2008-08-02 12:52:10 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Karen Hovhannisyan">
<P>The principal finding of our systematic review is that no pharmacotherapy convincingly improves survival in patients with ARDS and ALI. We identified 33 RCTs of pharmacologic treatments for established ALI and ARDS enrolling 3272 patients, with the first trials published in 1985 (<LINK REF="STD-Reines-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Reines 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Weigelt-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Weigelt 1985</LINK>). The median number of patients randomized per trial was low (45, range 9 to 725). Our pooled analyses had sample sizes of 180 to 1416 patients (early high-dose corticosteroids and surfactant therapy respectively). When we combined studies, there was no effect on early mortality of PGE<SUB>1</SUB>, NAC, the early administration of high-dose corticosteroids, or surfactant. With respect to adverse effects, all trials of PGE<SUB>1</SUB> and early high-dose corticosteroids and four out of five surfactant trials with safety data showed more adverse events with active therapy. However, the potential difficulty of achieving effective blinding of PGE<SUB>1</SUB> and surfactant may have biased adverse event reporting in the active treatment arms. Of the miscellaneous interventions evaluated in single trials, corticosteroids given late in the course of ARDS decreased ICU and hospital mortality (<LINK REF="STD-Meduri-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Meduri 1998</LINK>), and pentoxifylline decreased mortality in patients with metastatic cancer and ARDS (<LINK REF="STD-Ardizzoia-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Ardizzoia 1993</LINK>). We did not analyse the effect of rutin (<LINK REF="STD-Ortolani-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Ortolani 2000</LINK>), which we classified as a nutritional supplement. </P>
<P>In our pooled analyses, we did not find a differential effect in patients with ARDS compared to patients meeting criteria for ALI but not ARDS, although these subgroup analyses were underpowered. Similarly, the results of our analyses did not change when they were restricted to studies with definite allocation concealment or studies with balanced cointerventions. However, we did not perform a sensitivity analysis considering only trials that evaluated therapies with documented evidence of bioavailability and biologic effect. </P>
<P>Because the confidence intervals around pooled relative risks for PGE<SUB>1</SUB>, NAC, early high-dose corticosteroids, and surfactant therapy are wide, we cannot exclude the possibility of a modest benefit or harm to patients. However, in each case the overall best estimate of relative risk suggested no effect. Clinical application of these therapies is therefore not currently justified. Any additional large trials should await preclinical and preliminary clinical studies to identify variations of dose, timing of administration, and formulation that may lead to clinical benefit. For example, a recently completed trial of HL 10 (<LINK REF="STD-HL-10-2004" TYPE="STUDY">HL 10 2004</LINK>) evaluated the only surfactant preparation shown to be potentially beneficial (<LINK REF="STD-Kesecioglu-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Kesecioglu 2001</LINK>), a porcine surfactant with a high phospholipid concentration delivered by intratracheal installation. </P>
<P>We found that the scientific quality (<LINK REF="REF-Guyatt-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guyatt 2002</LINK>) of included trials was variable. Methodologic strengths of a clear majority of studies included caregiver blinding or "double-blinding" (<LINK REF="REF-Devereaux-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Devereaux 2001</LINK>), analysis of early mortality by strict intention-to-treat criteria (analysis according to assigned group and zero withdrawals), and complete patient follow-up. No study documented differential application of potentially important cointerventions, although the majority provided no information about cointerventions. A minority of studies described adequate allocation concealment. About one-half of the trials documented similarity between treatment groups for at least one prognostically important baseline characteristic. Our assessment of methodologic features was restricted to published descriptions, and we may therefore have underestimated the methodologic strength of some studies, especially those reported in abstract form (<LINK REF="STD-Bernard-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Bernard 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gottlieb-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Gottlieb 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kesecioglu-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Kesecioglu 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Reines-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Reines 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Spragg-2002a" TYPE="STUDY">Spragg 2002a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Spragg-2002b" TYPE="STUDY">Spragg 2002b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Walmrath-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Walmrath 2000</LINK>). </P>
<P>Another limitation of this systematic review is the identification of a small number of trials for each pharmacologic therapy, most of which randomized a small number of patients. Plots of study precision versus treatment effect for trials of NAC, PGE<SUB>1</SUB> and surfactant therapy suggested the existence of small unpublished non-beneficial trials. However, the inclusion of any such trials would not qualitatively change our findings of no treatment effect for these interventions. We did not search for RCTs of pharmacologic therapies for other related critically-ill populations (such as sepsis) reporting outcomes in subgroups of patients with ALI and ARDS because of limitations in the interpretation of subgroup analyses.<BR/>
<BR/>Strengths of this systematic review include the use of strategies to minimize bias in the selection and reporting of studies: the extensive literature search, duplicate independent screening of articles and data abstraction, and explicit criteria for methodologic assessment (<LINK REF="REF-Oxman-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oxman 2002</LINK>). We used clinical judgment to decide <I>a priori</I> to combine studies for which a similar direction and magnitude of treatment effect could reasonably be expected. Although aggregated studies differed with respect to eligibility criteria and study medications (formulation, method of administration, and dose), we found no statistical evidence of between study variation in trials of PGE<SUB>1</SUB>, NAC, and surfactant therapy. One of two statistical methods used suggested substantial heterogeneity between the two studies of early high dose corticosteroids (<LINK REF="STD-Bernard-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Bernard 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Weigelt-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Weigelt 1985</LINK>). However, neither study individually demonstrated a benefit, supporting the decision to pool their results. We used random effects models to aggregate data and generate conservative confidence limits for the point estimate of the pooled treatment effect (<LINK REF="REF-Montori-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Montori 2002</LINK>). We did not find statistically significant differences in treatment effect according to prespecified hypotheses concerning patient population or methodology. <BR/>
<BR/>Effective pharmacologic therapy for established ALI and ARDS is therefore extremely limited. We identified two potentially beneficial treatments. First, prolonged corticosteroid administration for late ARDS, which may attenuate the fibroproliferative process, was evaluated in one small trial (<LINK REF="STD-Meduri-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Meduri 1998</LINK>). This study randomized 24 patients with late-phase ARDS and showed an impressive but clinically implausible point estimate of benefit, with a wide confidence interval (absolute risk reduction in ICU mortality 0.62; 95% CI, 0.30-0.95). Methodologic strengths of this trial included blinding of caregivers, intention-to-treat analysis, complete follow-up, and adjustment for baseline imbalances. The authors did not describe concealment of allocation. However, the major limitation is the method of data analysis. The investigators calculated <I>a priori</I> that 99 patients would be required to detect an absolute survival improvement of 30% in corticosteroid-treated patients. Enrolment was terminated prematurely using early stopping rules based on sequential clinical trials (<LINK REF="REF-Whitehead-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Whitehead 1983</LINK>). This approach may inflate the treatment effect in small trials (<LINK REF="REF-Marras-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marras 1999</LINK>) by increasing the probability of confounding by imbalances in baseline prognostic characteristics. Patients in the corticosteroid group had less organ dysfunction and pulmonary morbidity and thus may have had a better prognosis, a bias which may have persisted despite statistical adjustment and confounded the results. In addition, the crossover of four of the eight placebo-assigned patients to corticosteroids (as per protocol) precluded an accurate evaluation of the infection risk associated with this treatment. Therefore, this trial provides important albeit preliminary evidence for the efficacy of corticosteroids for late-phase ARDS. The recently completed Late Steroid Rescue Study, which randomized 180 patients, should provide more definitive data (<LINK REF="STD-LaSRS-2000" TYPE="STUDY">LaSRS 2000</LINK>). </P>
<P>The second potentially beneficial intervention was pentoxifylline, a phosphodiesterase inhibitor that prevents neutrophil chemotaxis and activation. This therapy was evaluated in a randomized trial enrolling 30 patients with metastatic cancer (<LINK REF="STD-Ardizzoia-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Ardizzoia 1993</LINK>). Although unclear allocation concealment and lack of blinding threaten the internal validity of this trial, the most important limitation is lack of generalizability. Eighteen of 30 randomized patients had lymphangitic metastases that may have mimicked the characteristic radiographic changes of ARDS and caused diagnostic misclassification. The mortality in this trial was higher (25 of 30 patients died at 1 month) than generally observed in patients with ARDS (<LINK REF="REF-Rubenfeld-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rubenfeld 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ware-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ware 2000</LINK>), which limits the applicability of the findings to lower-risk patients. Finally, the severity of patients' lung injury according to AECC criteria (<LINK REF="REF-Bernard-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bernard 1994</LINK>) was not clear because the authors did not describe the oxygenation criteria used for the diagnosis of ARDS or whether patients required mechanical ventilation. In conclusion, further research is required to assess the potential role of pentoxifylline in the treatment of ALI and ARDS in patients without cancer. </P>
<P>There are several potential reasons to explain the large number of non-beneficial trials of pharmacologic therapies for ALI and ARDS. These explanations overlap with insights into the design of RCTs in patients with severe sepsis (<LINK REF="REF-Opal-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Opal 2003</LINK>). First, randomized trials may have been conducted before early investigations had established the optimal dose and duration of the candidate therapy that would achieve adequate tissue levels and biologic response. Second, the definition of the clinical syndrome of ALI and ARDS, although feasible to apply in clinical settings and in research, does not have optimal reliability and validity (<LINK REF="REF-Ferguson-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ferguson 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rubenfeld-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rubenfeld 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Villar-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Villar 1999</LINK>). Trials may therefore have enrolled patients unlikely to respond to candidate therapies. However, an inadequate definition of ALI and ARDS cannot be the exclusive explanation for non-beneficial trials given the recent positive RCT of low tidal volumes in ALI patients (<LINK REF="REF-ARDS-Network-2000a" TYPE="REFERENCE">ARDS Network 2000a</LINK>). Third, ALI and ARDS are clinically heterogeneous syndromes with various causes, genetic susceptibilities (<LINK REF="REF-Villar-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Villar 2003</LINK>) and clinical courses. Trials may thus have included responsive and non-responsive subgroups. Fourth, there are many important non-pulmonary determinants of outcome for patients with ALI and ARDS. Fifth, investigators may have overestimated the intrinsic therapeutic potential of candidate therapies. The latter three points may have contributed to the design of RCTs that were inadequately powered to reliably detect moderate clinical benefits.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2008-08-02 12:52:11 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Karen Hovhannisyan">
<P>Our pooled analyses provide no evidence to support the routine administration of PGE<SUB>1</SUB>, NAC, early high-dose corticosteroids, or surfactant in critically ill patients with ALI and ARDS. Single studies showed no evidence of treatment effect of dazoxiben, acyclovir, indomethacin, neutrophil elastase inhibitor (ICI 200,880), procysteine, interleukin 10, ketoconazole, lisofylline, or granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor. Single small studies have shown a potential benefit of prolonged corticosteroid administration in late-phase ARDS and pentoxifylline in patients with metastatic cancer and ARDS. However, there is currently insufficient evidence to support the routine use of either therapy.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2008-08-02 12:59:14 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Karen Hovhannisyan">
<OL>
<LI>Preclinical research should develop novel candidate therapies for ALI and ARDS and adequately assess pharmacologic properties and biologic response prior to large randomized trials.</LI>
<LI>Subgroups of patients with ALI should be defined that share biochemical and/or genetic homogeneity and that may benefit from targeted pharmacologic interventions.</LI>
<LI>Further clinical studies are required to assess the potential benefit of pentoxifylline in ALI and ARDS patients without cancer.</LI>
<LI>Future adequately powered RCTs should implement rigorous methods to maximize internal validity. Reporting of important cointerventions would assist the assessment of performance bias, especially in trials without caregiver blinding.</LI>

<P>The following minor errors and omissions have been corrected in issue 1, 2005:</P>
<P>1) In Spragg 2002b (in the 'Table of Comparisons', under 'Surfactant'), the treatment and control numbers of patients randomized were reversed. The review previously read surfactant: '108' and control: '117'. This has been corrected to read: surfactant '117' and control '108'.</P>
<P>2) In Methodological quality of included studies/Baseline characteristics, the review previously stated 'Of the remaining 30 studies, nine had at least one clinically important imbalance at baseline.' This has been corrected to read 'Of the remaining 29 studies, ten had at least one clinically important imbalance at baseline.' Weigelt 1985 has now been properly cited. </P>
<P>3) In Methodological quality of included studies/Cointerventions, the review previously stated 'Eleven studies standardized at least one cointervention or documented its application in the treatment and control groups.' This has been corrected to read 'Twelve studies standardized at least one cointervention or documented its application in the treatment and control groups,' and Weigelt 1985 has now been appropriately cited.<BR/>

<P>Methods notes:<BR/>Baseline similarity: Pre-randomization factors assessed included age, severity of illness, non-pulmonary organ failures, presence of sepsis, and duration of hospitalization, ICU stay, or mechanical ventilation. Factors are listed if they were clinically similar between treatment and control groups. Factors with significant clinical differences (D) between groups and included in an adjusted analysis (A) are noted.<BR/>Blinding: We assessed blinding of caregivers, data collectors, and outcomes assessors and note the use of other terms. We interpreted "double-blind" to include caregiver blinding.<BR/>Cointerventions: We assessed whether the use of PEEP, a lung protective ventilation strategy, weaning protocols, corticosteroids, or other interventions were standardized or documented.<BR/>Withdrawals: The number of randomized patients withdrawn from the mortality analysis.<BR/>Losses to follow-up: The number of randomized patients with incomplete follow-up data for mortality. </P>
