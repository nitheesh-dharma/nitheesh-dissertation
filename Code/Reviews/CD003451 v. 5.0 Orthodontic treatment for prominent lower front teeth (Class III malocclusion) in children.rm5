<P>
<B>Review question </B>
</P>
<P>There are many different ways of treating patients with prominent (or sticking out) lower front teeth. Orthodontic treatment for children and adolescents is one method used. This review, carried out by authors of the Cochrane Oral Health Group, sought to establish which is the most effective type of orthodontic treatment when carried out in childhood; whether these treatments reduce the need for treatment as an adult; and at what age these treatments are best carried out to ensure that changes made to the shape of the jaw and the positioning of the teeth last until the end of growth and can be maintained into adulthood.</P>
<P>In severe cases, people may need surgery as adults to correct this condition. If a successful approach to treatment in childhood were to be found, with long-lasting effects, this kind of surgery may not be necessary. Additionally, the risk of damage to teeth and joints, together with the negative psychological effects associated with the condition, could be lessened or avoided.</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>Prominent lower front teeth can be an important problem for some people and are usually due to the way the jaws meet together. This condition may be the source of teasing, problems eating, and occasionally problems with speech. The condition may also give rise to problems with the jaw joints in later life. Orthodontic treatment relies on the use of appliances of various kinds either inside or outside of the mouth that are fixed in some way to the teeth, and sometimes placed on parts of the head, to influence the growth of the jaws and position of teeth.</P>
<P>This review looked at the use of four different types of orthodontic treatment for correcting prominent lower front teeth in children.</P>
<P>
<I>-</I>Facemask: an appliance rests on the forehead and chin, connected to the upper teeth with elastic bands that are placed by the wearer. Through this arrangement a balanced force is applied, which it is hoped will pull the upper teeth and jaw forwards and downward to correct the prominent lower teeth.</P>
<P>
<I>-</I>Chin cup: an appliance rests on the chin with a strap around the back of the head. Forward growth of the lower jaw is resisted, correcting the prominence of the lower front teeth. Nothing is placed in the mouth.</P>
<P>
<I>-</I>Mandibular headgear: a strap rests on the back of the head and is connected to the lower teeth. This resists forward growth of the lower teeth and jaw in order to correct the prominent lower front teeth.</P>
<P>
<I>-</I>Tandem traction bow appliance: attachments are fixed to the top and bottom teeth. In the top attachment there is a hook on each side. A metal bar is placed in the lower attachment, which sits in front of the lower teeth. An elastic band can then be placed on each side to pull the top jaw forward and bottom jaw backwards, to correct the prominent lower teeth.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>The evidence on which this review is based was found to be up to date as of 7 January 2013.</P>
<P>A total of seven suitable studies were identified and included in this review; they included 339 children aged from five to 11 years. There were roughly equal numbers of girls and boys in each study and participants were from different ethnic groups depending on where the study was carried out. Studies included were conducted in Turkey, Egypt, China, the United States of America and the United Kingdom.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results </B>
</P>
<P>This review found some evidence that the use of a facemask appliance can help to correct prominent lower front teeth on a short-term basis. There was no evidence available to show whether or not these short-term changes will still be maintained until the child is fully grown. There was not enough evidence to support any other types of treatment for prominent lower front teeth.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
</P>
<P>The quality of the evidence for the use of a facemask was moderate to low, whilst the quality of the rest of the evidence was very low.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2013-09-26 15:03:03 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Simon Watkinson">
<P>Prominent lower front teeth (termed reverse bite; under bite; Class III malocclusion) may be due to a combination of the jaw or tooth positions or both. The upper jaw (maxilla) can be too far back or the lower jaw (mandible) too far forward, or both. Prominent lower front teeth can also occur if the upper front teeth (incisors) are tipped back or the lower front teeth are tipped forwards, or both. Various treatment approaches have been described to correct prominent lower front teeth in children and adolescents.</P>

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2013-09-26 19:20:40 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Simon Watkinson">
<P>We searched the following databases: Cochrane Oral Health Group's Trials Register (to 7 January 2013), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (<I>The Cochrane Library </I>2012, Issue 12), MEDLINE via OVID (1946 to 7 January 2013), and EMBASE via OVID (1980 to 7 January 2013).</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2013-09-26 15:05:38 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Simon Watkinson">
<P>Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) recruiting children or adolescents or both (aged 16 years or less) receiving any type of orthodontic treatment to correct prominent lower front teeth (Class III malocclusion). Orthodontic treatments were compared with control groups who received either no treatment, delayed treatment or a different active intervention.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2013-09-26 15:04:52 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Simon Watkinson">
<P>Screening of references, identification of included and excluded studies, data extraction and assessment of the risk of bias of the included studies was performed independently and in duplicate by two review authors. The mean differences with 95% confidence intervals were calculated for continuous data. Meta-analysis was only undertaken when studies of similar comparisons reported comparable outcome measures. A fixed-effect model was used. The I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic was used as a measure of statistical heterogeneity.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-09-30 15:35:29 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Simon Watkinson">
<P>Seven RCTs with a total of 339 participants were included in this review. One study was assessed as at low risk of bias, three studies were at high risk of bias, and in the remaining three studies risk of bias was unclear. Four studies reported on the use of a facemask, two on the chin cup, one on the tandem traction bow appliance, and one on mandibular headgear. One study reported on both the chin cup and mandibular headgear appliances.</P>
<P>One study (n = 73, low quality evidence), comparing a facemask to no treatment, reported a mean difference (MD) in overjet of 4.10 mm (95% confidence interval (CI) 3.04 to 5.16; P value &lt; 0.0001) favouring the facemask treatment. Two studies comparing facemasks to untreated control did not report the outcome of overjet. Three studies (n = 155, low quality evidence) reported ANB (an angular measurement relating the positions of the top and bottom jaws) differences immediately after treatment with a facemask when compared to an untreated control. The pooled data showed a statistically significant MD in ANB in favour of the facemask of 3.93 ° (95% CI 3.46 to 4.39; P value &lt; 0.0001). There was significant heterogeneity between these studies (I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 82%). This is likely to have been caused by the different populations studied and the different ages at the time of treatment.</P>
<P>One study (n = 73, low quality evidence) reported outcomes of the use of the facemask compared to an untreated control at three years follow-up. This study showed that improvements in overjet and ANB were still present three years post-treatment. In this study, adverse effects were reported but due to the low prevalence of temporomandibular (TMJ) signs and symptoms no analysis was undertaken.</P>
<P>Two studies (n = 90, low quality evidence) compared the chin cup with an untreated control. Both studies found a statistically significant improvement in ANB, and one study also found an improvement in the Wits appraisal. Data from these two studies were not suitable for pooling.</P>
<P>A single study of the tandem traction bow appliance compared to untreated control (n = 30, very low quality evidence) showed a statistically significant difference in both overjet and ANB favouring the intervention group.</P>
<P>The remaining two studies did not report the primary outcome of this review.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2013-09-26 15:09:30 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Simon Watkinson">
<P>There is some evidence that the use of a facemask to correct prominent lower front teeth in children is effective when compared to no treatment on a short-term basis. However, in view of the general poor quality of the included studies, these results should be viewed with caution. Further randomised controlled trials with long follow-up are required.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2013-09-26 15:35:31 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Orthodontics is the branch of dentistry concerned with the growth of the jaws and face, the development of the teeth, and the way the teeth and jaws bite together. It also involves treatment of the teeth and jaws when they are irregular or bite in an abnormal way, or both. There are many reasons why the teeth may not bite together correctly. These include the position of the teeth, jaws, lips, tongue and/or cheeks, or may be due to a habit or the way people breathe. All of these factors can be influenced by genetics or by the environment. The need for treatment can be decided by looking at the effect of any particular tooth position on the life expectancy of the teeth or the effect that the appearance of the teeth has on how people feel about themselves, or both (<LINK REF="REF-Shaw-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shaw 1991</LINK>).</P>
<P>Prominent lower front teeth (termed reverse bite; under bite; Class III malocclusion) may be due to a combination of the jaw or tooth position, or both, resulting from genetic factors or environmental influence or both. The upper jaw (maxilla) can be too far back or the lower jaw (mandible) too far forward, or both. Prominent lower front teeth can also occur if the upper front teeth (incisors) are tipped back or the lower front teeth are tipped forwards or both. Prominent lower front teeth can give a person an aggressive appearance, which may be the source of teasing (<LINK REF="REF-Shaw-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shaw 1980</LINK>). Patients with prominent lower front teeth often report that they have problems eating, and occasionally problems with speech. Prominent lower front teeth can give rise to problems with the jaw joints in later life (<LINK REF="REF-Mohlin-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mohlin 1980</LINK>). Prominent lower front teeth are most common in oriental (15%) and black races (10%) and are relatively uncommon in Caucasian (4%) populations (<LINK REF="REF-el_x002d_Mangoury-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">el-Mangoury 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Proffit-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Proffit 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Silva-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Silva 2001</LINK>). Prominent lower front teeth are usually due to the way the jaws meet together with either the upper jaw being too small, the lower jaw being too large, or a combination of both.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2013-09-26 15:37:51 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Several dental brace (orthodontic) treatments have been suggested to correct prominent lower front teeth. Some treatments aim to tip the upper front teeth forwards and the lower front teeth backwards whilst others aim to modify the growth of the upper or lower jaw or both to reduce or correct the prominence of the lower front teeth. Treatment can involve the use of one or more types of orthodontic brace. Some braces apply a force directly to the teeth and can either be removed from the mouth or fixed to the teeth with special glue during treatment. Other types of brace are attached, via the teeth, to devices (for example chin cup, reverse headgear, facemask) that allow a force to be applied to the teeth and jaws from the chin or forehead, or both. A further, more recently described technique has been the use of bone-anchors surgically placed to the jaw bones prior to activation with elastics (<LINK REF="REF-De-Clerck-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">De Clerck 2010</LINK>). Treatment is usually carried out either early, when the patients have a mixture of their baby and adult teeth present (around seven to 11 years of age), or later when all the adult teeth have come into the mouth (around 12 to 16 years of age). However, in some cases treatment is carried out early, before six years of age, when the patients only have their baby teeth present or later when the patient is an adult. In severe cases, and with some adult patients, orthodontic treatment may need to be combined with jaw surgery to correct the position of one or both jaws.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2013-09-26 15:38:04 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There are several ways in which the intervention may correct the prominence of the lower front teeth. It may move the top jaw forwards, the top teeth forwards, the bottom jaw backwards, the bottom teeth backwards, or often a combination of these factors. Some interventions may also have an influence on the vertical position of the jaws, which in turn influences the antero-posterior position of the jaws due to the rotation of the jaws during growth.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2013-09-26 15:38:20 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is currently a multitude of different appliances available to try to correct the prominence of lower front teeth in children. There is, however, little consensus as to which of these approaches may be best. There is also little known about the long-term effects of these approaches. If a successful approach that has effects that last until the end of growth could be found this may prevent the need for surgical treatment when the patient is older.</P>

<P>Three studies (n = 179) investigated the use of a facemask versus an untreated control (<LINK REF="STD-Mandall-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Mandall 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vaughn-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Vaughn 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Xu-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Xu 2001</LINK>). We have combined the results from the study using the facemask with and with out rapid maxillary expansion as these groups showed no statistical difference (see later) (<LINK REF="STD-Vaughn-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Vaughn 2005</LINK>). The only outcome considered by all three studies was ANB. The <LINK REF="STD-Mandall-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Mandall 2010</LINK> study also assessed overjet and self esteem measures whilst <LINK REF="STD-Vaughn-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Vaughn 2005</LINK> also assessed Wits appraisal (another measure of the relative positions of the maxilla and mandible). The <LINK REF="STD-Mandall-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Mandall 2010</LINK> study reported outcomes at the end of treatment and at three years follow-up.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Overjet</HEADING>
<P>One study reported overjet (<LINK REF="STD-Mandall-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Mandall 2010</LINK>) and found a statistically significant difference of 4.10 mm (95% confidence interval (CI) 3.04 to 5.16; P value &lt; 0.0001) in favour of the facemask post-treatment. The study also found a statistically significant difference of 2.50 mm (95% CI 1.21 to 3.79; P value = 0.0001) at three years follow-up.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">ANB</HEADING>
<P>Three studies included the outcome ANB (<LINK REF="STD-Mandall-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Mandall 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vaughn-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Vaughn 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Xu-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Xu 2001</LINK>) and it was possible to undertake a meta-analysis at the post-treatment stage. The pooled estimate was 3.93 ° (95% CI 3.46 to 4.39; P value &lt; 0.0001) in favour of the facemask. There was substantial heterogeneity (P value = 0.004; I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 82%) between the studies, which may have been due to several factors including: different inclusion criteria, different ethnic groups, different populations, and different ages of the patients at the start of treatment. However, each study demonstrated a statistically significant benefit for the facemask and we thought it appropriate to pool the results. The random-effects model gave rise to a similar estimate of 3.70 ° (95% CI 2.50 to 4.91; P value &lt; 0.0001) compared to the fixed-effect model.</P>
<P>One study assessed ANB at three years follow-up (<LINK REF="STD-Mandall-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Mandall 2010</LINK>) and found that a statistically significant benefit persisted in favour of the facemask (mean difference (MD) 1.4 °, 95% CI 0.43 to 2.37; P value = 0.004).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Wits appraisal</HEADING>
<P>One study looked at Wits appraisal (<LINK REF="STD-Vaughn-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Vaughn 2005</LINK>) and showed a benefit in favour of the facemask of -3.84 mm (95% CI -5.31 to -2.37; P value &lt; 0.0001).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Self esteem</HEADING>
<P>There was no difference between the facemask and untreated control groups in the <LINK REF="STD-Mandall-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Mandall 2010</LINK> study in the outcome of self esteem measured on the Piers-Harris self esteem index at either the post-treatment or three years follow-up time points (Additional <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>).</P>
<P>The OASIS assessment of self esteem, however, did demonstrate a statistically significant benefit for the facemask at the post-treatment stage of -4.00 (95% CI -7.40 to -0.60; P value = 0.02). However, there was no significant difference at three years follow-up (MD -3.40, 95% CI -7.99 to 1.19; P value = 0.15).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Adverse effects</HEADING>
<P>One study (<LINK REF="STD-Mandall-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Mandall 2010</LINK>) reported on temporomandibular joint (TMJ) signs and symptoms. These were assessed by looking at pain (lateral and intra-auricular), clicking, crepitus, locking, muscle tenderness (temporalis, masseter, and lateral pterygoid), and restriction of jaw movement (maximum opening and lateral movement). In addition, the presence of forward mandibular displacement on closure was recorded. It was noted that due to the low prevalence of TMJ signs and symptoms at all time points no statistical analysis was carried out.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Facemask with expansion versus facemask only</HEADING>
<P>Only one study (n = 46) compared the facemask with and without expansion (<LINK REF="STD-Vaughn-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Vaughn 2005</LINK>). There was no evidence of a difference between treatment using a facemask with or without the use of rapid maxillary expansion for the outcomes of ANB (MD -0.13 °, 95% CI -1.40 to 1.14; P value = 0.84) and Wits appraisal (MD -0.16 mm, 95% CI -1.63 to 1.31; P value = 0.83) (<LINK REF="CMP-002.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.1</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-002.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.2</LINK>; Additional <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>).</P>

<P>Only one study (n = 20) compared the Nanda facemask versus a conventional facemask (<LINK REF="STD-Keles-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Keles 2002</LINK>). There was weak evidence of a difference in ANB between the groups using each design of facemask in favour of the Nanda facemask (MD 1.29 °, 95% CI 0.16 to 2.42; P value = 0.02) (<LINK REF="CMP-003.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.1</LINK>; Additional <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>).</P>

<P>Outcome data on use of 600 g versus 300 g were reported in one study (<LINK REF="STD-Abdelnaby-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Abdelnaby 2010</LINK>). There was no difference in ANB (MD 0.10 °, 95% CI -0.31 to 0.51; P value = 0.63) or Wits appraisal (MD -0.30 mm, 95% CI -1.12 to 0.52; P value = 0.47) (<LINK REF="CMP-005.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 5.1</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-005.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 5.2</LINK>; Additional <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Mandibular headgear versus untreated control</HEADING>
<P>One study (n = 60) comparing mandibular headgear with control provided data for ANB (<LINK REF="STD-Arun-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Arun 1994</LINK>).

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Facemask therapy</HEADING>
<P>We found some evidence that facemask therapy was more effective at improving overjet, ANB and Wits appraisal immediately post-treatment when compared with an untreated control. The improvements in overjet and Wits appraisal were still statistically significant at three years follow-up, although reduced in comparison to the changes immediately post-treatment. These changes remained of clinical significance. Whilst immediately following treatment there was a statistically significant improvement in the OASIS score, there was no evidence that facemask treatment produced clinically important changes in patients' self esteem measures.</P>
<P>There was insufficient evidence to determine whether there was a difference between the outcomes reported in a comparison between facemask with and without the use of rapid maxillary expansion from the single small study which evaluated this comparison. Therefore, its use solely as an adjunct to improve the efficacy of facemask therapy can not be recommended.</P>
<P>One study (<LINK REF="STD-Keles-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Keles 2002</LINK>) compared the use of a Nanda facemask (force applied at parallel to the Frankfort plane at a level 20 mm above the occlusal plane) with a conventional facemask (force applied at 30 ° at the level of the occlusal plane). This very small study showed weak evidence of a difference in ANB between the two appliances in favour of the Nanda facemask, however, due to the size of the study and its risk of bias, no recommendation can be made to support one design over the other.</P>
<P>The ultimate aim of facemask treatment is to correct the jaw discrepancy at an early stage so reducing the need for any orthognathic surgical intervention at a later stage. It must be noted that only one published study has reported data beyond the end of orthodontic treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Mandall-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Mandall 2010</LINK>) and this only at three years follow-up, so no evidence was found for a long-term benefit for facemask therapy beyond three years.</P>
<P>Only one study (<LINK REF="STD-Mandall-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Mandall 2010</LINK>) reported on adverse effects and showed no changes in TMJ signs and symptoms as a result of facemask therapy.</P>
</SUBSECTION>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Chin cup therapy</HEADING>
<P>We found two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Abdelnaby-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Abdelnaby 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Arun-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Arun 1994</LINK>) showing evidence that the use of a chin cup led to statistically significant benefit in ANB when compared to an untreated control. A meta-analysis was not possible due to missing data from one study (<LINK REF="STD-Arun-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Arun 1994</LINK>). Again, the studies were short-term and there was no evidence of any long-term benefit.</P>
<P>There was no statistically significant difference found between the use of 300 g and 600 g forces when used with the chin cup.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Tandem traction bow appliance (TTBA)</HEADING>
<P>One study (<LINK REF="STD-Atalay-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Atalay 2010</LINK>) reported results on the use of the TTBA when compared with an untreated control. It showed that there was a statistically significant benefit in favour of the TTBA. Again, the study was short-term and there was no evidence for long-term benefit.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Mandibular headgear</HEADING>
<P>One study (<LINK REF="STD-Arun-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Arun 1994</LINK>) reported results on the use of mandibular headgear compared to an untreated control and the chin cup. Statistical analysis was not possible due to missing data, however it was reported that there was significant benefit in favour of the mandibular headgear with respect to ANB when compared to the untreated control. There was no statistically significant difference between the mandibular headgear and the chin cup.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2013-09-26 16:29:38 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Overall, seven studies were found investigating multiple comparisons to treat prominent lower front teeth in children; they reported multiple outcomes. Four of the studies investigated the facemask, two the chin cup, one the Tandem traction bow appliance and one mandibular headgear. Only one study investigated outcomes beyond the treatment phase and, to date, that was only at three years follow-up. This has major implications for the applicability of the evidence. An aim of early intervention for a Class III malocclusion is to prevent subsequent need for corrective orthognathic surgery. The current evidence does not allow us to assess if any of the interventions have succeeded in this aim due to their short-term nature.</P>
<P>The concern of many patients seeking treatment for a Class III malocclusion is that their lower front teeth meet in front of their upper front teeth and therefore they have a reverse overjet. However, only two of the studies (<LINK REF="STD-Atalay-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Atalay 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mandall-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Mandall 2010</LINK>) reported overjet as an outcome.</P>
<P>Only one study (<LINK REF="STD-Mandall-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Mandall 2010</LINK>) carried out an a priori sample size calculation and it is likely that the <LINK REF="STD-Keles-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Keles 2002</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Vaughn-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Vaughn 2005</LINK> studies were underpowered to find a difference between their facemask groups.</P>
<P>The lack of accurate reporting, especially with respect to unclear methodology and, in one case, missing statistical data, means much of the evidence was of low or very low quality and the results must be interpreted with caution.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2013-09-26 16:31:27 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The overall quality of the evidence can be seen in the 'Summary of findings' tables (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>; <LINK REF="SOF-02" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 2</LINK>; <LINK REF="SOF-03" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 3</LINK>).</P>
<P>The evidence regarding overjet and ANB changes when comparing the use of a facemask with an untreated control has been graded as moderate. This implies that further research is likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect. It may change the estimate but is unlikely to overturn the direction of the effect.</P>
<P>All other comparisons and outcomes have been graded as a low or very low level of evidence. The reasons for this are the low number of studies and participants, the unclear or high risk of bias in these studies, and in the meta-analysis the high level of heterogeneity.</P>

The difference in confidence is due to the greater number of studies that the other systematic reviews have included. This discrepancy is due to the different inclusion criteria used in our systematic review when compared to the previous reviews. We have only included prospective randomised controlled trials, whilst the other reviews have included retrospective studies, which are more susceptible to bias.</P>
<P>The review by <LINK REF="REF-Kim-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kim 1999</LINK> supports the use of rapid maxillary expansion prior to facemask therapy, whilst we have found insufficient evidence to support this protocol.

<P>There is low quality evidence that the use of facemask therapy between the ages of six to 10 years leads to short-term improvements in overjet and ANB. There is insufficient high quality evidence to comment on the long-term benefits.</P>
<P>Due to the lack of evidence we remain uncertain as to the benefits of any other appliances in the early treatment of prominent lower front teeth in children.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2013-09-26 16:36:33 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Simon Watkinson">
<P>In view of the quality of the studies identified in this systematic review, it has been difficult to draw definitive conclusions. This review suggests the need for more long-term, well designed and reported randomised controlled clinical studies to assess the efficacy of early orthodontic treatment of prominent lower front teeth.</P>
<P>When designing future studies, the following need to be considered.</P>
<UL>
<LI>Clear inclusion and exclusion criteria should be set.</LI>
<LI>An a priori sample size calculation should be carried out.</LI>
<LI>The use of outcomes relevant to the patient (not solely a list of cephalometric measures) should be used. We recommend the following:</LI>
<UL>
<LI>overjet;</LI>
<LI>overjet change;</LI>
<LI>correction of an anterior crossbite;</LI>
<LI>ANB;</LI>
<LI>psychosocial measures.</LI>
</UL>
<LI>The following methodological points are recommended:</LI>
<UL>
<LI>recording if there is a discrepancy between intercuspal position and retruded contact position;</LI>
<LI>all lateral cephalograms should be taken in the retruded contact position.</LI>
</UL>
<LI>Adverse effects should be reported.</LI>
<LI>Long-term follow-up to assess fully if the treatment has been successful at the end of growth should be considered.</LI>
<LI>Reports on clinical trials would be improved by following the guidelines produced by the CONSORT group to ensure that all relevant information is provided.</LI>

<B>Comparison:</B> Tandem traction bow appliance (TTBA) versus untreated control</P>
<P>Group 1: The modified TTBA: After dental casts were obtained, a wax construction bite was obtained with a 5-6 mm vertical opening at the molar region and without any sagittal activation. The modified TTBA comprised an upper splint, a lower splint, and a traction bow. The upper splint had Adams' clasps in the posterior region for retention and elastic hooks between the maxillary central and lateral incisors. The upper splint covered the palatal and occlusal surfaces, in addition to 1&#8211;2 mm of the buccal surfaces of the maxillary teeth. The lower splint covered the buccal and lingual surfaces of the mandibular teeth. Activator tubes were embedded in the posterior region of the lower splint. A conventional headgear facebow was modified and used as the traction bow. The outer bows of the facebow were cut to approximately 3 cm and shaped as a letter 'S'. 2 elastics that exerted a force of 400&#8211;500 g on 1 side were worn between the labial hooks and the traction bow. The elastic force was directed between 35 ° and 40 ° to the occlusal plane by arranging the position of the outer traction bows.

<B>Comparison:</B> Nanda facemask versus conventional facemask</P>
<P>Group 1: Facemask with modified angle of force direction (Nanda group): Composed of 3 parts: a modified full-cover acrylic cap splint expansion appliance, a specially designed facebow, and a Petit type protraction headgear. The cap splint expansion appliance was modified by adding 2 tubes (3M Unitek, USA, item no. 325&#8211;303) on the buccal side of the acrylic in the premolar area. The tubes were soldered to the RME screw (Leone, item A620-09) and the acrylic was constructed. The purpose of these tubes was to accommodate the inner bows of the specially designed facebow. The facebow was constructed from an adjustable facebow (Ormco, item 200- 0227 Glendora, CA, USA). The inner bows of the facebow ended in the mouth with a special U-shaped bend in order to enter the buccal tubes from the distal, and thus be able to retain itself when an anterior pull was applied. In order to carry the level of force application above the occlusal plane, the outer bows of the facebow were bent in a 30 ° upward direction and ended with 2 hook bends in order to hold the elastics used for the facemask. These hooks were positioned around the root tips of the first and second premolars and 500 g of force was applied parallel to the Frankfort plane in an anterior direction. The same Petit-type facemask was used and the direction of the force was adjusted by moving the wire piece upward on the facemask for elastic engagement (n = 11)</P>
<P>Group 2: Conventional facemask: This consisted of a cap splint&#8211;type rapid palatal expander modified by adding 2 hooks in the canine area. The purpose of these hooks was to hold the elastics in place for protraction. The protraction headgear was a Petit type (Ormco Corporation, Glendore, Calif), and a force of 500 g was applied to each hook at a 30 ° angle to the occlusal plane (n = 9)</P>
<P>In both groups, treatment was started with 10 days of rapid maxillary expansion. Following the expansion, a facemask was applied to the patients of both groups and the appliance was used for 6 months after the onset of treatment. Patients were advised to wear the facemask for a minimum of 16 hours per day in the first 3 months and 12 hours in the second 3 months. In both groups a 500 g force was used. In group 1 the force was applied parallel to the Frankfort horizontal plane, in group 2 it was angled downward 30 ° to the occlusal plane</P>

<P>
<B>Comparison:</B> Facemask versus untreated control</P>
<P>Group 1: Facemask group: A bonded maxillary acrylic expansion device was placed. This consisted of a metal framework and a midline expansion screw to which 3 mm acrylic was adapted. The appliance was modified, if needed, with acrylic extending over the upper incisor edges to increase appliance retention. 1 vestibular hook was located, on each side, in the upper deciduous first molar position, for elastic traction. The appliance was cemented with glass ionomer cement, but if it later debonded, it was re-cemented with composite, following acid etching of the buccal and palatal cusps of the upper first permanent molars. For patients with posterior crossbites, the expansion screw was activated one quarter turn (0.25 mm) per day until the lingual cusps of the upper posterior teeth approximated the buccal cusps of the lower posterior teeth. If no transverse change was required, the maxillary splint was still activated once a day for 7&#8211;10 days in order to disrupt the circum-maxillary sutures. A commercially available adjustable facemask was used (TP Orthodontics), which had bilateral vertical rods connected to both chin and forehead pads. This design was adjustable vertically to customize the fit. If patients experienced chin reddening, ventilation holes were drilled through the plastic chin pad or soft padding was added. Elastics were connected bilaterally to the adjustable midline crossbow in a downwards and forwards direction. Patients were asked to wear the facemask for 14 hours per day, continuously, during the evening and night. A co-operation calendar was used in an attempt to increase treatment compliance, although this was not formally statistically evaluated. Extra-oral elastics of increasing strength were used (3/80 8 oz elastics for 1&#8211;2 weeks; then 1/20 14 oz elastics; then 5/160 14 oz elastics) until a force of 400 g per side was delivered. The direction of elastic traction was downwards and forwards 30 ° from the vestibular hooks on the bonded maxillary expander to the adjustable crossbar of the facemask. Additionally, the elastics could be crossed over to prevent catching or interference (n = 35)</P>
<P>Group 2: Control: Following collection of initial records the patients allocated to the control group received no clinical intervention. They were recalled 15 months after registration for collection of final records (n = 38)</P>
<P>Both groups were then recalled for follow-up at 3 years</P>

<CHAR_OUTCOMES MODIFIED="2013-09-26 17:18:34 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Simon Watkinson">
<P>Data were collected at the following time points:<BR/>DC1: baseline data at study registration<BR/>DC2: 15 months after baseline data collection</P>
<P>DC3: 3 years after baseline data collection<BR/>
</P>
<P>Cephalometric and occlusal measurements: The lateral cephalograms were traced by an experienced clinician who was blinded as to group allocation. To determine the rotations of the maxillary and occlusal planes superimposition of the DC1, DC2 and DC3 lateral cephalometric radiographs was undertaken by another author using Bjork's structural method which employs the anterior zygomatic process as the reference landmark. PAR scores were measured by a calibrated examiner. Overjet measurements were recorded from study models, with a steel millimetre ruler, by an experienced examiner</P>
<P>
<BR/>Psychosocial measures: The short form of the Piers&#8211;Harris children's self concept scale (60 questions) (<LINK REF="REF-Piers-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Piers 2002</LINK>) was used to evaluate self concept. This may have been influenced by receiving early Class III treatment. Psychosocial/oral health related quality of life effects of treatment were assessed using the OASIS (<LINK REF="REF-Mandall-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mandall 2000</LINK>), which sums the impact of concern about appearance of teeth, including nice comments, unpleasant comments, teasing, avoidance of smiling, covering the mouth because of the teeth and self perceived aesthetic component of the Index of Orthodontic Treatment Need.</P>
<P>
<BR/>TMJ examination: All the orthodontists involved in the study received training from a TMJ specialist before the start of the study to ensure that the TMJ examination was standardized. This TMJ specialist also advised that an examination appropriate for this age group of children should assess pain (lateral and intra-auricular), clicking, crepitus, locking, muscle tenderness (temporalis, masseter, and lateral pterygoid), and restriction of jaw movement (maximum opening and lateral movement). In addition, the presence of forward mandibular displacement on closure was recorded. TMJ signs or symptoms were recorded at DC1 to ensure no patients might be treated with protraction facemask that may exacerbate any TMJ problems through potential downwards and backwards rotation at the chin point. No patients were excluded at baseline because of pre-existing TMJ signs or symptoms</P>

<P>Group 1: Facemask with expansion group: Treated with palatal expansion with facemask therapy. A banded, soldered, jackscrew palatal expansion appliance was used for each subject. 2 teeth per side were banded: the first and second deciduous molars, the first permanent molar and the second deciduous molar, or the first permanent molar and premolar. The appliance was activated twice daily (0.5 mm/day) for a minimum of 7 days. Soldered hooks (.045 in) were extended to the mesial of the canine for attachment of the force-delivering elastics. Each facemask was fabricated on a model made from an impression of the patient's face. The facemask was fitted 7 to 10 days after the placement of the palatal appliance. Elastics, directed 15 ° to 30 ° downward from the occlusal plane, delivered a force of 300 to 500 g per side, as determined by a force gauge. The participants were instructed to wear the appliance full time at the beginning of treatment. Compliance was closely monitored with timecards. Once positive overjet and overbite and Class I molar occlusion were obtained, facemask wear was reduced to 14 hours a day. In anticipation of some relapse, over correction, approaching an end-to-end molar relationship and overjet of 4 to 5 mm, were the treatment objectives. The treatment results were maintained for 3 to 6 months with nighttime wear (n = 15)</P>
<P>Group 2: Facemask only group: The protocol in group 2 was identical to that for group 1 except that the palatal expander was not activated. If patients required transverse expansion, this was performed after final records (T2) were obtained (n = 14)</P>
<P>Group 3: Control group: Initial records (T0) were taken at enrolment and 1 year later (n = 17)</P>

<P>Lateral cephalometric radiographs were taken at T0, T1, and T2 for the control group, and at T1 and T2 for the 2 treatment groups. 55 standard cephalometric landmarks were digitised in a pre-determined order with a digitiser accurate to 0.001 mm. Traditional cephalometric measurements were used to describe changes between pre-treatment, post-treatment, and control lateral cephalograms. Measurements included a combination of the Steiner, McNamara, Ricketts, Riedel, and Wits analyses. Changes in 55 landmarks were also evaluated relative to an x-y coordinate system. The Johnston analysis also was used to differentiate between skeletal and dental changes and to provide a method to evaluate the combined treatment effects (skeletal and dental) along the mean functional occlusal plane</P>

<P>The lateral cephalograms were traced by an experienced clinician who was blinded as to group allocation</P>
<P>It was not possible to blind the clinician or the patient in this study. However, the study was single-blind, as the researchers measuring the radiographs and study models and the statistician were blinded to the treatment/control allocation until the data were analysed and the code broken. Ideally the clinician collecting the records at the 15-month DC2 time point would have also been blinded as to group allocation. However, this was not attempted, because with only 1 operator was involved at each centre they would have had the patient's notes in front of them at the time of data collection. Also, it was likely that the clinicians would have remembered who had received protraction facemask treatment</P>
