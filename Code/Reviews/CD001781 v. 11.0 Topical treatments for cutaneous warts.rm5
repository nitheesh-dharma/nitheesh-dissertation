<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2012-08-06 15:24:18 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Cathy Bennett">
<P>Viral warts are a common skin disease, most frequently affecting the hands and feet, caused by the human papilloma virus. While warts are not harmful and usually go away in time without any treatment, they can be unsightly and painful. Warts on the soles of the feet are also called 'plantar warts' or 'verrucas'.</P>
<P>This review did not cover the treatment of genital warts, and it only considered the evidence provided by the results of randomised controlled trials.</P>
<P>Salicylic acid (SA), a cheap and easily-available solution painted on to warts, had a definite but modest beneficial effect compared to placebo. It is effective for warts at all sites and has few adverse effects, but it may take several weeks of daily use to work.</P>
<P>Cryotherapy, usually using liquid nitrogen, is often used for the treatment of warts, but it is less convenient, more painful, and also more expensive. One study suggested that there is evidence that cryotherapy is better than SA for warts on the hands, but when we combined this study with our other results, we were unable to confirm this. We found that more aggressive cryotherapy appears to be more effective than gentle cryotherapy, but with an increased risk of adverse effects, such as pain, blistering, and scarring. We only looked at information from clinical trials of cryotherapy and not over-the-counter freezing treatments for warts, so we cannot say if these are as effective.</P>
<P>During the production of the last version of this review, duct tape had gained favour as it is a safe and simple treatment that is easy to apply; however, the trial on which this was based was relatively small. In this updated review, we found two further trials of duct tape that suggested that this treatment is not as effective as first thought.</P>
<P>Other treatments covered by this review include 5-fluorouracil, dinitrochlorobenzene, intralesional bleomycin, intralesional interferon, photodynamic therapy, and intralesional antigen. None of these treatments are used commonly, even by skin specialists, and there is much less evidence for their effectiveness. The limited available evidence we do have suggests that some of these treatments may be effective and could therefore be used for warts that have not responded to simpler, safer treatments, such as salicylic acid or cryotherapy.</P>
<P>Overall, providing a useful idea of 'what works' from such a wide range of studies was difficult as many studies were of poor quality.</P>

<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2012-08-06 14:30:08 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Cathy Bennett">
<P>Two authors independently selected trials and extracted data; a third author resolved any disagreements.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-08-06 14:59:42 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Cathy Bennett">
<P>We included 85 trials involving a total of 8815 randomised participants (26 new studies were included in this update). There was a wide range of different treatments and a variety of trial designs. Many of the studies were judged to be at high risk of bias in one or more areas of trial design.</P>
<P>Trials of salicylic acid (SA) versus placebo showed that the former significantly increased the chance of clearance of warts at all sites (RR (risk ratio) 1.56, 95% CI (confidence interval) 1.20 to 2.03). Subgroup analysis for different sites, hands (RR 2.67, 95% CI 1.43 to 5.01) and feet (RR 1.29, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.55), suggested it might be more effective for hands than feet.</P>
<P>A meta-analysis of cryotherapy versus placebo for warts at all sites favoured neither intervention nor control (RR 1.45, 95% CI 0.65 to 3.23). Subgroup analysis for different sites, hands (RR 2.63, 95% CI 0.43 to 15.94) and feet (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.26 to 3.07), again suggested better outcomes for hands than feet. One trial showed cryotherapy to be better than both placebo and SA, but only for hand warts.</P>
<P>There was no significant difference in cure rates between cryotherapy at 2-, 3-, and 4-weekly intervals.</P>
<P>Aggressive cryotherapy appeared more effective than gentle cryotherapy (RR 1.90, 95% CI 1.15 to 3.15), but with increased adverse effects.</P>
<P>Meta-analysis did not demonstrate a significant difference in effectiveness between cryotherapy and SA at all sites (RR 1.23, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.71) or in subgroup analyses for hands and feet.</P>
<P>Two trials with 328 participants showed that SA and cryotherapy combined appeared more effective than SA alone (RR 1.24, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.43).</P>
<P>The benefit of intralesional bleomycin remains uncertain as the evidence was inconsistent. The most informative trial with 31 participants showed no significant difference in cure rate between bleomycin and saline injections (RR 1.28, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.78).</P>
<P>Dinitrochlorobenzene was more than twice as effective as placebo in 2 trials with 80 participants (RR 2.12, 95% CI 1.38 to 3.26).</P>
<P>Two trials of clear duct tape with 193 participants demonstrated no advantage over placebo (RR 1.43, 95% CI 0.51 to 4.05).</P>
<P>We could not combine data from trials of the following treatments: intralesional 5-fluorouracil, topical zinc, silver nitrate (which demonstrated possible beneficial effects), topical 5-fluorouracil, pulsed dye laser, photodynamic therapy, 80% phenol, 5% imiquimod cream, intralesional antigen, and topical alpha-lactalbumin-oleic acid (which showed no advantage over placebo).</P>
<P>We did not identify any RCTs that evaluated surgery (curettage, excision), formaldehyde, podophyllotoxin, cantharidin, diphencyprone, or squaric acid dibutylester.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2012-08-07 16:34:12 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Cathy Bennett">
<P>Data from two new trials comparing SA and cryotherapy have allowed a better appraisal of their effectiveness. The evidence remains more consistent for SA, but only shows a modest therapeutic effect. Overall, trials comparing cryotherapy with placebo showed no significant difference in effectiveness, but the same was also true for trials comparing cryotherapy with SA. Only one trial showed cryotherapy to be better than both SA and placebo, and this was only for hand warts. Adverse effects, such as pain, blistering, and scarring, were not consistently reported but are probably more common with cryotherapy.</P>
<P>None of the other reviewed treatments appeared safer or more effective than SA and cryotherapy. Two trials of clear duct tape demonstrated no advantage over placebo. Dinitrochlorobenzene (and possibly other similar contact sensitisers) may be useful for the treatment of refractory warts.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Biology</HEADING>
<P>Cutaneous viral warts are a very common skin condition caused by the human papilloma virus (HPV), and most people experience warts in one form or another at some point in their lives (<LINK REF="REF-Sterling-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sterling 2004</LINK>). There are over 100 types of HPV, which are all DNA viruses that infect epithelial cells. Viral replication and proliferation in fully-differentiated epithelium results in warty papules or plaques on the skin.</P>
<P>The appearance of warts is variable depending on the HPV type and the anatomical site infected; sometimes HPV does not result in visible warts but remains dormant within epithelial cells. The most common infections are with HPV type 2 on the hands and feet. HPV types 1, 4, 27, and 57 are also frequently found in common warts. Plane or flat warts, which are clinically distinct from common warts and usually occur on the distal limbs and face, are caused by HPV types 3 and 10. Genital warts, caused by a different group of HPV types (mainly 6 and 11), are also very common, but they were not considered within this review.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Epidemiology</HEADING>
<P>There is limited high-quality epidemiological data on viral warts, and prevalence studies tend to focus on subsets of populations, such as dermatology outpatients or school children (<LINK REF="REF-Benton-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Benton 1997</LINK>). Two large population studies across all age groups in the USA and Russia produced markedly-different prevalence rates for viral warts: 0.84% (<LINK REF="REF-Johnson-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnson 1978</LINK>) and 12.9% (<LINK REF="REF-Beliaeva-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beliaeva 1990</LINK>), respectively. The Lambeth study of skin disease in a stratified population of over 2000 adults aged 15 to 75 years reported an overall prevalence of warts of 3.3% (<LINK REF="REF-Rea-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rea 1976</LINK>). Among school populations, reports of prevalence rates also appear variable with 3.9% to 4.7% reported in 11 to 16 year-olds in the UK (<LINK REF="REF-Williams-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Williams 1993</LINK>), 22% in 4 to 18 year-olds in Australia (<LINK REF="REF-Kilkenny-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kilkenny 1998</LINK>), and 33% in 3 to 12 year-olds in the Netherlands (<LINK REF="REF-van-Haalen-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Haalen 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>Despite the lack of accurate and consistent data, it is generally agreed that visible viral warts are uncommon in infancy, common in childhood, and their prevalence declines fairly rapidly from the second decade of life onwards. There are many risk factors for the development of viral warts. For example, young people who regularly expose their bare feet in changing rooms and swimming pools are at greater risk of plantar warts, that is, warts on the soles of the feet (<LINK REF="REF-Johnson-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnson 1995</LINK>). In addition, certain occupations have been identified as being at increased risk of acquiring hand warts: These include fishmongers, butchers, and other meat handlers (<LINK REF="REF-Keefe-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Keefe 1994</LINK>). Immunosuppression, whether due to drugs or disease, also predisposes to HPV infection, but is beyond the remit of this review. In general, the same principles apply to treating warts in healthy individuals and immunosuppressed individuals, but in the latter group, success rates are often lower.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Natural history and morbidity (to treat or not to treat?)</HEADING>
<P>Among immunocompetent individuals, non-genital warts are usually harmless and spontaneously resolve within months to years. A number of factors, such as host immunity, HPV type, and site of infection, all influence the rate of resolution. A frequently-cited study of an institutionalised population found that two-thirds resolved within a two-year period (<LINK REF="REF-Massing-1963" TYPE="REFERENCE">Massing 1963</LINK>). A number of trials included in the review clearly showed more rapid rates of cure in placebo and 'no active treatment' groups. With a relatively good chance of natural resolution, it can be argued that warts are best left untreated (<LINK REF="REF-Bridger-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bridger 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ordoukhanian-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ordoukhanian 1997</LINK>), and for some people, this may be the best option, perhaps especially when warts are not very symptomatic and have not been present for a prolonged period of time. However, warts can persist for years and, untreated, represent a pool of HPV infection in the community. Furthermore, ordinary warts can be associated with very significant morbidity (<LINK REF="REF-Ciconte-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ciconte 2003</LINK>), including an unsightly appearance (on the face and hands) and pain (on the soles of the feet). This morbidity is easily and frequently underestimated and dismissed.</P>

<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2012-08-06 15:36:12 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>A wide range of different interventions were considered in this review.</P>
<UL>
<LI>Cryotherapy describes any treatment that induces cold damage to warts. The most common device used is a liquid nitrogen spray, but liquid nitrogen can also be applied to warts with a cotton bud.</LI>
<LI>Salicylic acid is painted on to warts.</LI>
<LI>Duct tape is stuck over warts.</LI>
<LI>Bleomycin, interferons, and various antigens in solution are injected into warts (intralesional injection).</LI>
<LI>5-fluorouracil is either applied to warts as a cream or injected into warts as a solution.</LI>
<LI>The immunotherapy treatments (including dinitrochlorobenzene, diphencyprone, and squaric acid dibutylester) are applied in a solution to warts.</LI>
<LI>Photodynamic therapy and pulsed dye laser treatments are, essentially, destructive treatments that aim to destroy the infected tissues. Photodynamic therapy involves the application of a sensitising cream followed by a light shined on the skin. The pulsed dye laser consists of concentrated light energy that is directed on to individual warts.</LI>
</UL>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2012-08-06 16:02:36 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Cathy Bennett">
<P>Most topical treatments for viral warts are thought to work by selectively causing damage to cells infected with HPV. Completely-destroyed cells are obviously eradicated, but it is likely that partially-damaged cells expose HPV to the immune system encouraging natural immune-mediated eradication of the infection.</P>
<P>Salicylic acid is a keratolytic (softening/peeling) agent, but there is some uncertainty regarding its mechanism of action. It is believed to act by reducing cohesion between corneocytes, which leads to shedding of epidermal cells rather than lysis of keratin (<LINK REF="REF-Lin-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lin 1998</LINK>). Salicylic acid is also an irritant and may help initiate an immune response, resulting in the eradication of HPV (<LINK REF="REF-Micali-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Micali 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>The mode of action of duct tape is not well-understood, but it has been suggested that duct tape occlusion may produce a macerating and keratolytic environment, which may stimulate an immune response (<LINK REF="STD-Wenner-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Wenner 2007</LINK>). However, it has also been suggested that it may have a psychological effect that works better in children than adults (<LINK REF="REF-Allen-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Allen 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>Cryotherapy, usually with liquid nitrogen, is applied as a number of freezes at intervals of two to four weeks. The freeze causes tissue destruction by damaging cells and their vascular supply, and it is believed to also stimulate the immune system, so it can lead to resolution of warts at distant sites (<LINK REF="REF-Dawber-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dawber 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>The mechanism of immunotherapy in the treatment of warts is unclear. One theory suggests that antigen exposure on a wart's surface causes a type IV hypersensitivity reaction, which causes inflammation that damages both virally-infected and normal cells (<LINK REF="REF-Brodell-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brodell 2003</LINK>). A second theory suggests that the substance applied acts as a hapten to wart virus proteins to induce an immune reaction to warts.</P>
<P>5-Fluorouracil has antineoplastic and antimetabolite properties that inhibit DNA and RNA synthesis, which is believed to be the mechanism that stops wart proliferation (<LINK REF="STD-Salk-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Salk 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>The exact action of bleomycin on warts is unclear. Bleomycin has damaging effects on DNA and is also believed to have antiviral effects, which may result in wart resolution (<LINK REF="REF-Templeton-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Templeton 1994</LINK>).</P>
<P>Photodynamic therapy and pulsed dye laser treatments are, essentially, all destructive treatments that aim to damage HPV-infected cells in a more accurate or targeted way than salicylic acid and cryotherapy. With photodynamic therapy, HPV-infected cells absorb more of a photosensitising chemical (usually 5-aminolevulinic acid) than normal cells and are therefore preferentially damaged by the visible light source that is subsequently used to irradiate lesions. The pulsed dye laser that preferentially targets vascularised tissues is thought to work by selectively damaging the blood supply to the warts.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2012-08-07 15:44:33 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Cathy Bennett">
<P>Warts have a high prevalence in the general population. There are many local treatments for cutaneous warts, some of which are established and commonly-used. Local, or topical treatments, are defined as all treatments designed to be put on or in the wart, such as salicylic acid and cryotherapy, or removal of the wart by surgery. These are distinct from systemic (for example, medicines given by tablet or injection, which reach all parts of the body) or psychological treatments. Recent studies are exploring alternative treatments that may work as well as established treatments or may be used in difficult-to-treat or recurring warts when conventional treatments have failed. </P>
<P>In view of the potential for expensive treatment options, both in terms of the treatments and medical or nursing time spent on administering treatment, this updated review is necessary to summarise the current available evidence. This will help to provide guidance and identify areas for further research.</P>

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2012-08-07 16:07:34 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Cathy Bennett">
<P>We assessed risk of bias using 'Risk of bias' tables completed according to the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2009</LINK>). Risk of bias was assessed for each trial, and we considered the following: sequence generation; allocation concealment; blinding of participants, personnel, and outcome assessors; and incomplete outcome data. Where there was insufficient information in the trial report to make a judgement, we contacted trial investigators of studies that were 10 years old or less for further information. Two review authors (CB and CSK or SG) carried out 'Risk of bias' assessments independently. Where there was discrepancy, the third review author made the final decision.<BR/>

<EFFECT_MEASURES MODIFIED="2012-08-02 14:59:19 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Cathy Bennett">
<P>Measures of treatment effect included cure rate, number of warts cured, partial cure rate, changes in wart size, and adverse events. We used cure rate and adverse events as the main measure of treatment effect.</P>
<P>Where appropriate, we reported number needed to treat (NNT) for cure rate outcomes and number needed to harm (NNH) for adverse events together with 95% CI. For the parallel group-designed trials, we used risk ratios with 95% confidence intervals (CI) as the main measure of effect. For the within-participant trials, we reported statistical analysis techniques used together with the resulting P value from the original publications, since no formal statistical pooling was possible.</P>
</EFFECT_MEASURES>
<UNIT_OF_ANALYSIS MODIFIED="2012-08-07 16:17:07 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Unit of analysis issues included groups of individuals randomised together, multiple observations for the same outcome, and individuals undergoing more than one intervention. For warts trials, left and right randomisation of two interventions may present a potential problem with the unit of analysis. While this method reduces bias due to baseline differences among participants, there is still the risk of bias as a result of choosing a less severe side for a particular intervention in unblinded studies and the possible systemic effects of local treatments.</P>
<P>Some trials considered individual warts as the unit of analysis, which made analysis problematic because a single individual could be assessed and treated multiple times.</P>
<P>We identified trials with these unit of analysis issues as possible sources of study heterogeneity. Furthermore, we identified trials with multiple treatment arms.</P>

<HETEROGENEITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2012-08-07 16:26:50 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Cathy Bennett">
<P>The heterogeneity of the trials made it difficult to perform statistical pooling of the data or descriptive synthesis of information. There were many variables that distinguished trials, including both participant and treatment factors.</P>
<P>We assessed heterogeneity by considering various factors in each study. Elements considered included age of participants (children, adults), sites for wart lesions (hand, feet), types of lesions (plane and mosaic warts), previous treatment (untreated and refractory to previous treatment), and trial period (different periods of treatment and follow up). Treatment factors included differences in concentrations, formulations, and methods of application of salicylic acid and other topical agents. There were different delivery systems of cryotherapy and different concentrations, and for intralesional therapies, there were differences in vehicles and intervals between injections; different types of tape; problems with tape falling off and compliance; different wavelengths of pulsed light therapies, duration of exposure, and intervals between treatments; and different periods of treatment and periods before assessment of outcome.</P>

<DATA_SYNTHESIS MODIFIED="2012-08-07 16:41:35 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Cathy Bennett">
<P>We examined the data from included studies for descriptive synthesis and pooling of dichotomous data where trials were sufficiently homogeneous in design, methodology, and outcomes. When data were pooled, we used the DerSimonian and Laird random-effects model because of anticipated heterogeneity between the included studies.</P>

<SUBGROUP_ANALYSIS MODIFIED="2012-08-02 15:14:50 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Cathy Bennett">
<P>There were insufficient studies to perform subgroup analyses on most of the factors described above (e.g. children/adults, new warts/refractory warts), but we conducted some subgroup analyses comparing warts situated on the hands with warts on the feet (plantar warts). The small number of trials for many treatments and small sample sizes for each trial meant these subgroup analyses were of relatively limited value.</P>
<P>We investigated statistical heterogeneity using the I² statistic. An I² statistic of 30% to 60% represented a moderate level of heterogeneity; an I² statistic of 50% to 90% was treated as evidence of substantial heterogeneity; and an I² statistic of 75% to 100% was treated as considerable heterogeneity (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2009</LINK>).</P>

<P>Some studies also considered other measures of treatment efficacy, such as number of warts cured, partial cure rate, and changes in wart size, but we did not include these in our meta-analyses. The reason for this is that from a clinician's and a participant's perspective, the ideal treatment should completely cure all warts. So, partial response, change in size, or reduced number of warts is less satisfactory than complete cure.</P>

This was a trial of photodynamic therapy (PDT) versus placebo, and unpublished data obtained from the author showed cure rates of 26/34 participants (76%) with PDT versus (vs) 13/33 (42%) with placebo at 22 months. Following further correspondence with the author, it emerged that this was a quasi-randomised trial rather than a true RCT; therefore, it was moved onto the list of excluded trials.</P>

One study used a questionnaire to look at long-term outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-Keefe-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Keefe 1990</LINK>), and it found that 83% of participants believed they were cured at the end of the treatment period, but only 57% were cleared of warts after a median follow-up time of 19 months.

<P>Trials of topical preparations containing SA (with or without additional lactic acid) are summarised in the additional data table, <LINK REF="CMP-013.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 13.1</LINK>. Meta-analysis of 6 of these studies (with 486 participants) in <LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK> showed a statistically-significant result favouring the topical application of SA for warts at all sites (RR 1.56, 95% CI 1.20 to 2.03). We used a random-effects model as heterogeneity between studies was moderate (I² statistic = 35%).</P>
<P>We conducted subgroup analyses to investigate the effects of therapy at specific sites. The results showed a larger size of effect for warts on the hands (2 studies, n = 120 participants) (RR 2.67, 95% CI 1.43 to 5.01; <LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>; P = 0.002) than on the feet (2 studies, n = 139 participants) (RR 1.29, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.55; <LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>).</P>
<P>The overall result for those studies that reported results for warts on both hands and feet combined also significantly favoured the intervention, with a size of effect intermediate between that for hands alone and feet alone (RR 1.62, 95% CI 1.15 to 2.30; <LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>).</P>

<P>Unfortunately, reporting of adverse effects was less complete, and pooling of data on pain and blistering was not possible. The impression from those trials that did comment on adverse effects was that, not surprisingly, pain and blistering were more frequent with aggressive cryotherapy.</P>
<P>One trial (<LINK REF="STD-Connolly-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Connolly 1999</LINK>) of 126 participants noted increased morbidity in the aggressive freeze group, including 2 participants who required additional treatment for severe blistering.

<P>This translates to a 45% increase in pain, blistering, or both, in the 'aggressive' group and a number needed to harm (NNH) of<B> </B>6.2 for pain and 10.3 for blistering. Five participants withdrew from the aggressive group and one from the gentle group due to pain and blistering.</P>

<P>Evaluation of four of the seven included trials (<LINK REF="CMP-013.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 13.3</LINK>) of intralesional bleomycin was hampered by the fact that they used warts rather than participants as the unit of analysis. The results of these 4 trials (<LINK REF="STD-Bunney-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Bunney 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hayes-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Hayes 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rossi-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Rossi 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Munkvad-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Munkvad 1983</LINK>) varied widely, with cure rates between 16% and 94% of warts, and should be interpreted with considerable caution (<LINK REF="CMP-013.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 13.3</LINK>). The trials used different concentrations, delivery systems, and total doses of bleomycin, but none of these factors seem to correlate with their rates of success.</P>
<P>Two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Perez-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Perez 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Munkvad-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Munkvad 1983</LINK>) of the four trials (<LINK REF="STD-Bunney-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Bunney 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Munkvad-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Munkvad 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Perez-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Perez 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rossi-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Rossi 1981</LINK>) that compared bleomycin with placebo reported that bleomycin was ineffective compared with placebo.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Munkvad-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Munkvad 1983</LINK>, used a within-participant randomised design on 108 warts in 62 participants, and bleomycin achieved a cure in 4/22 in the bleomycin + saline group (18%), 5/36 in the bleomycin in oil group (14%), 8/19 in the saline placebo group (42%), and 10/22 in the oil placebo group (45%) for warts assessed at 3 months. Only 1 trial of 31 participants (<LINK REF="STD-Perez-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Perez 1992</LINK>) used participants as the unit of analysis and demonstrated a cure rate of 15/16 (94%) that was not significantly different from the 11/15 (73%) achieved with placebo injections of saline (RR 1.28, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.78; <LINK REF="CMP-012.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 12.1</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Cure rate</HEADING>
<P>The 2 older trials from the 1970s used different dyes with dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO) and different light sources. One of the trials (<LINK REF="STD-Veien-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Veien 1977</LINK>) used a left/right within-participant design and reported complete resolution (100%) of the placebo PDT half compared to 40% resolution in the PDT-treated half. The other (<LINK REF="STD-Stahl-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Stahl 1979</LINK>) showed equally disappointing results with PDT and topical SA with creosote.</P>
<P>Two more recent studies evaluated PDT with aminolevulinic acid (ALA) for refractory warts. Both trials used warts as the unit of analysis. The first trial (<LINK REF="STD-Stender-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Stender 1999</LINK>), described as a pilot study, compared a number of different light sources with 4 treatments of cryotherapy and showed PDT to be superior, with cure rates of up to 73% of warts compared with 20% in the cryotherapy group. The second study (<LINK REF="STD-Stender-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Stender 2000</LINK>) from the same research team involved 45 adults with refractory warts and compared ALA-PDT with placebo PDT and showed cure rates of 64/114 (56% of warts) and 47/113 (42% of warts), respectively, which was statistically significant (P &lt; 0.05). All warts were also treated with paring and topical SA ('Verucid').

<P>Another trial (<LINK REF="STD-Fuchs-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Fuchs 2004</LINK>) was an article that the trial investigator sent to the review authors after we identified his conference abstract.

There were higher cure rates with placebo cream (2/16 (12.5%)) than with 5-ALA cream (0/14 (0%)), which suggests that PDT did not improve cure rate.

We found one RCT (<LINK REF="STD-Yazar-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Yazar 1994</LINK>) that should be mentioned. From the paper, this appears to have been a randomised and, at best, single-blind, placebo-controlled trial in which silver nitrate (percentage concentration not given) was applied every three days for an unspecified period with the placebo being black ink. The outcome was assessed one month after the last application. The complete cure rate was 15/35 (43%) in the treatment group and 4/35 (11%) in the placebo group.</P>

<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Gustafsson-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Gustafsson 2004</LINK> compared alpha-lactalbumin-oleic acid (ALOA) with placebo. This employed the topical application of an unusual hybrid molecule (consisting of a combination of alpha-lactalbumin from human breast milk and oleic acid) said to be lethal to a wide range of transformed cells, but harmless to normal ones. The trial appeared to have been properly randomised and double-blind, but the analysis focused on the main outcome of &gt; 75% reduction in wart volume rather than the more relevant complete clearance of warts. Unfortunately, the trial defaulted to an open-label design after three months making the long-term follow-up data potentially biased. Reported data showed that whilst 100% of those in the active treatment group experienced &gt; 75% reduction in wart volume, only 21% of lesions in the treatment group resolved completely, and only 9/20 (45%) participants with active treatment experienced the resolution of at least 1 wart compared with 3/20 (15%) in the placebo group (RR 3.0, 95% CI 0.95 to 9.48).</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Horn-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Horn 2005</LINK> was an RCT of the use of intralesional antigen injection for warts (a form of local immunotherapy designed to elicit an immune reaction in warts injected with candida, mumps, or trichophyton antigens). This was a complex study with four treatment arms (antigen with and without interferon (IFN) and placebo with and without IFN), which involved up to five injections given at three-weekly intervals into the largest wart on each participant. Blinding involved only the participants and not the investigators, introducing a source of potentially-significant bias. The main outcome reported was &gt; 75% reduction in wart surface area at the end of treatment. This is of questionable relevance to participants. Participants were evaluated at each episode of treatment, and no long-term follow up was reported. Two hundred and one participants with refractory warts completed the trial. Of the participants, 57/95 (60%) injected with antigen with or without additional interferon experienced the resolution of at least 1 wart compared with 25/106 (24%) of participants injected with saline or IFN alone. The number of participants who experienced complete clearance of all warts was difficult to ascertain from the study, but it appeared to have been 21/95 (22%) in the treatment groups and 11/106 (10%) in the 'placebo' groups.</P>

<P>Topical imiquimod, a novel immunomodulator drug, is an established treatment for genital warts. Two dose-finding RCTs for non-genital warts were obtained from 3M, the manufacturers of imiquimod. There was no significant difference in the proportion of participants whose warts were cured when analysed by ITT or per protocol when comparing different treatment regimens of 5% imiquimod cream (Aldara) for either common warts (<LINK REF="STD-Aldara-3M-2000b" TYPE="STUDY">Aldara 3M 2000b</LINK>) or 'plantar' (feet) warts (<LINK REF="STD-Aldara-3M-2000a" TYPE="STUDY">Aldara 3M 2000a</LINK>).

For common warts, clearance ranged from 9.5% to 10% in the active treatment groups, compared with 4.9% in the control group. Therefore, there was no evidence for effectiveness of this intervention.</P>
<P>One other trial (<LINK REF="STD-Erbagci-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Erbagci 2005</LINK>) reported as a conference abstract suggested that 5% topical imiquimod showed a significant reduction in the average number of warts compared to vehicle cream (P &lt; 0.05), but no numbers regarding cure rate were reported.

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2012-08-08 10:17:39 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Cathy Bennett">
<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-08-07 18:57:24 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Cathy Bennett">
<P>There were many more trials (85 studies with a total of 8724 participants) and a much wider variety of treatments and trial designs included in this review than in previous versions. This heterogeneity and the fact that much of the data were at high risk of bias made a meaningful synthesis of the results problematic. In many studies, outcomes other than those we specified were reported, or results were presented in such a way that data could not be extracted and used in calculations (and no further information was available to us). For these reasons, many trial results could not be put into graphs, and we presented them as summary tables.</P>
<P>Trials of topical salicylic acid (SA) showed a definite but modest effect for warts at all sites, possibly more marked for warts on the hands than for warts on the feet (often described as 'plantar warts' in the studies), although statistical tests confirmed that there was no significant difference in effectiveness between the different sites. Adverse effects occurred as a result of treatment. In 1 trial (<LINK REF="STD-Steele-1988b" TYPE="STUDY">Steele 1988b</LINK>) that compared a mixture of monochloroacetic acid and 60% SA with placebo, 1 of the 29 participants in the active treatment group developed cellulitis<I>. </I>This is the only study that reported cellulitis as an adverse effect of SA, and as it was a single event, it was difficult to be sure of its significance, especially since the SA was mixed with monochloroacetic acid in this study.</P>
<P>Data from trials of cryotherapy were less consistent and more difficult to interpret. <LINK REF="STD-Bruggink-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Bruggink 2010</LINK> was a new study included for this update, and its results taken on their own clearly supported the use of cryotherapy over SA or no treatment for hand warts, but not for 'plantar warts' (feet). In fact, neither SA nor cryotherapy was any better than no treatment for warts on the soles of the feet in this trial. Results from <LINK REF="STD-Cockayne-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Cockayne 2011</LINK> showed no statistically-significant difference between cryotherapy and SA for plantar warts. This trial did not include a control group.</P>
<P>When data from these newer trials were pooled with all the previously-included data, there remained no clear, statistically-significant difference in effectiveness between cryotherapy and placebo (or no treatment) for all sites and also in separate subgroup analyses for hands and feet. Likewise, all the data combined showed no clear statistically-significant difference in effectiveness between cryotherapy and SA for all sites and also in separate subgroup analyses for hands and feet. It was difficult to draw firm conclusions when looking at all of these meta-analyses together.</P>
<P>There was no significant difference between 2-, 3-, or 4-week cryotherapy treatment intervals. Aggressive cryotherapy was more effective, but with increased morbidity in the aggressive freeze group.</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Bruggink-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Bruggink 2010</LINK>, participants reported a significant burden of adverse effects after cryotherapy, including pain, blistering, and scarring; however, participants reported greater satisfaction with cryotherapy than SA. In <LINK REF="STD-Cockayne-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Cockayne 2011</LINK>, as the study progressed, more participants were happy with cryotherapy than SA.</P>
<P>A meta-analysis of three trials showed no significant advantage of intralesional interferon-alpha compared with placebo.</P>
<P>Two new trials (<LINK REF="STD-Adalatkhah-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Adalatkhah 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dhar-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Dhar 2009</LINK>) of intralesional bleomycin versus cryotherapy using within-participant, left/right comparisons were included in this review. Both trials showed bleomycin to be significantly more effective than cryotherapy. Pain and depigmentation occurred with both therapies. The effectiveness of bleomycin remains uncertain, however, as the design of these trials makes their results more difficult to interpret. The data from other trials of intralesional bleomycin are both heterogeneous and inconsistent (<LINK REF="CMP-013.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 13.3</LINK>). The only trial of intralesional bleomycin that used participants rather than warts as the unit of analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Perez-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Perez 1992</LINK>) favoured neither intralesional bleomycin nor control.</P>
<P>Two trials in 80 participants, comparing topical dinitrochlorobenzene with placebo, showed that it was more than twice as effective as placebo, but with a risk of local irritation due to sensitisation by the dinitrochlorobenzene.</P>
<P>Duct tape gained considerable favour following the publication of <LINK REF="STD-Focht-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Focht 2002</LINK> as it is a safe and simple treatment that is easy to apply. However, the trial was relatively small, and the length of freeze in the cryotherapy group was considered by some to be inadequate (<LINK REF="REF-Abramovits-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Abramovits 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Buccolo-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Buccolo 2003</LINK>). An unspecified number of outcome assessments were carried out over the telephone, and it is not entirely clear how long after the treatment period this was done. In updating this review, two trials of clear duct tape occlusive treatment versus placebo (<LINK REF="STD-de-Haen-2006" TYPE="STUDY">de Haen 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wenner-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Wenner 2007</LINK>) were included, which show fairly convincingly that this treatment is not as effective as the single earlier trial (<LINK REF="STD-Focht-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Focht 2002</LINK>) might have suggested. These two later trials (<LINK REF="STD-de-Haen-2006" TYPE="STUDY">de Haen 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wenner-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Wenner 2007</LINK>) were not without methodological problems either. <LINK REF="REF-van-Cleave-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Cleave 2006</LINK> reviewed the methodology used in <LINK REF="STD-de-Haen-2006" TYPE="STUDY">de Haen 2006</LINK>, highlighting the small sample size (making the study underpowered). The <LINK REF="STD-Wenner-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Wenner 2007</LINK> study had a number of limitations, which were discussed by the investigator in the study report; the mechanism of action of duct tape is unknown but may be related to the type of adhesive used. The two interventions may not have been directly comparable as some commentators have pointed out that the adhesive used in clear duct tape is not the same as standard silver duct tape (industrial, contractor grade duct tape) (<LINK REF="REF-Samlaska-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Samlaska 2011</LINK>). It seem this debate is likely to continue (<LINK REF="REF-Gibbs-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gibbs 2012</LINK>).</P>
<P>We summarised the results of studies that could not be combined by meta-analysis. Cure rates for pulsed dye laser treatments were not statistically significant. The efficacy of topical 5-fluorouracil was unclear. Intralesional 5-fluorouracil was investigated in 2 within-participant design trials in which there was higher cure rate in the 5-fluorouracil groups.</P>
<P>Two trials evaluated topical zinc treatments; there was a higher cure rate with topical zinc compared to water and a similar cure rate when compared to topical SA acid in both groups: 8/22 (36%) and 8/22 (36%).</P>
<P>One study evaluated the use of 80% phenol compared with cryotherapy; the cure rate was similar in the 2 groups but with more adverse events with phenol treatment.</P>
<P>A pilot study compared cryotherapy to smoke from burnt <I>Populus euphratica</I> leaves. The cure rate was not statistically significant.</P>
<P>There is scant evidence for silver nitrate, which was used in 1 RCT; the complete cure rate was 15/35 (43%) in the treatment group and 4/35 (11%) in the placebo group.</P>
<P>Different treatment regimens of topical imiquimod were tested with no significant difference in the proportion of participants whose warts were cured with each regimen.</P>
<P>Comment on the other two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Gustafsson-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Gustafsson 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Horn-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Horn 2005</LINK>) was made because they were both published RCTs and seemed to promise new and effective treatments. <LINK REF="STD-Gustafsson-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Gustafsson 2004</LINK> compared alpha-lactalbumin-oleic acid (ALOA) with placebo; the main outcome was a &gt; 75% reduction in wart volume. All of those in the active treatment group experienced &gt; 75% reduction in wart volume, but only 21% of lesions in the treatment group resolved completely. The number of participants whose warts completely cleared is not clear from the data, and overall, there is little to support the trial authors' optimistic conclusion that 'ALOA has potential as a novel therapeutic tool in the treatment of papillomas and other tumours'.</P>
<P>Sandra Johnson and Thomas Horn's group was the first to publish an RCT (<LINK REF="STD-Horn-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Horn 2005</LINK>) of the use of intralesional antigen injection for warts (a form of local immunotherapy designed to elicit an immune reaction in warts injected with candida, mumps, or trichophyton antigens). The cure rate for intralesional antigen injection for warts was 21/95 (22%) in the treatment groups and 11/106 (10%) in the placebo groups. For an elaborate and presumably fairly painful and expensive treatment, this does not appear to be a treatment with any striking advantages.</P>
<P>We did not identify any RCTs that evaluated surgery (curettage, excision), glutaraldehyde, formaldehyde, podophyllotoxin, or cantharidin.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2012-08-03 13:45:47 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There were 13 trials of topical SA with or without placebo and 20 trials of cryotherapy. Two new trials (<LINK REF="STD-Bruggink-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Bruggink 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cockayne-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Cockayne 2011</LINK>) have furnished a fuller and more realistic picture than we had previously about the effectiveness of SA and particularly cryotherapy. There is now a reasonable number of trials for SA versus placebo. The evidence for cryotherapy is a little less complete but enough to suggest that it has a place in the routine treatment of warts.</P>
<P>Many of the treatments were unusual and are unlikely to be used in regular clinical practice (e.g. intralesional antigen, interferons, smoke box using smoke from burnt <I>Populus euphratica</I> leaves).</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2012-08-07 19:00:36 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We identified several limitations in the body of evidence identified, and as a result, we were unable to draw robust conclusions. Although we included 85 trials, the very wide range of treatments used and methodological heterogeneity of many of the trials made pooling of data in meta-analyses problematic; therefore, each of our comparisons use data derived from relatively few trials.</P>
<P>The methodological quality of the evidence was poor. Despite a large number of published trials, only a minority were properly randomised (we excluded quasi-randomised studies from this review), and the majority of the trials that fit our inclusion criteria had unclear or inadequate allocation concealment. We were also unable to obtain further information from the trial investigators. The beneficial effects of treatments in these trials were likely to have been overstated. Also, many trials employed the use of within-participant randomisation (left and right randomisation), using individual warts or change in size of warts as the unit of analysis, which prevented the use of these data in our meta-analyses. Many trials also employed inadequate blinding of participants or outcome assessors, which is also likely to have exaggerated intervention effects.  </P>
<P>For all these reasons, the conclusions of this review cannot be robust, and we discuss the implication of this for future research (<LINK TAG="IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH" TYPE="SECTION">Implications for research</LINK>). There are tentative but definite pointers from individual studies to suggest that two widely-used therapies, cryotherapy and SA, are effective, although, overall, our analyses of pooled data did not support the supposition that these therapies are more effective for hand warts than warts on the feet.</P>

<P>Steps were taken to reduce bias in the review process.

<P>Most of our conclusions were unchanged from the previous publication of this Cochrane systematic review (<LINK REF="REF-Gibbs-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gibbs 2006</LINK>) and a previous publication that incorporates data from the studies included in this review (<LINK REF="REF-Kwok-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kwok 2011</LINK>). Important new data on cryotherapy and SA were included in this update, and there was new evidence for the efficacy of SA and cryotherapy from two large studies (<LINK REF="STD-Bruggink-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Bruggink 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cockayne-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Cockayne 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>Our findings are also largely consistent with a recently-published Clinical Evidence review (<LINK REF="REF-Loo-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Loo 2009</LINK>), with the important exception of the newer data on cryotherapy and SA, which were not included in <LINK REF="REF-Loo-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Loo 2009</LINK>.</P>

</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2012-08-07 19:09:03 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2012-08-07 19:06:03 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>More recent data from trials of cryotherapy and SA have provided better evidence for the use of these treatments. The relatively high rate of cure in control groups supports the notion that no treatment and awaiting spontaneous resolution is a very reasonable option, especially for recently-acquired warts that are not causing too much bother. Warts that do not resolve spontaneously after many months to a year are probably less likely to do so without treatment.</P>
<P>Salicylic acid appeared to be both effective and safe, but only modestly effective in terms of size of effect, and this is particularly true for plantar warts. Overall, the data for SA remains the most consistent.</P>
<P>The data on cryotherapy is more limited and less consistent, with only one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Bruggink-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Bruggink 2010</LINK>) showing it to be superior to placebo or no treatment, and this was only for warts on the hands; the same trial showed cryotherapy to be more effective than SA for hand warts.</P>
<P>The EVERT study (<LINK REF="STD-Cockayne-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Cockayne 2011</LINK>), which compared cryotherapy versus SA (with no placebo arm), showed that SA is similar in efficacy to cryotherapy for plantar warts.</P>
<P>No trial showed cryotherapy to be any more effective than placebo for plantar warts alone, and in view of this, the continued use of cryotherapy for plantar warts is highly questionable. Indeed, only one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Bunney-1971" TYPE="STUDY">Bunney 1971</LINK>, of SA) showed any treatment to be effective compared to placebo for plantar warts, and even then the size of effect was modest. Thus, no treatment seems to be particularly effective for plantar warts.</P>
<P>Pooled data from all relevant trials involving the treatment of warts at all sites showed no significant difference between cryotherapy and placebo, but also no difference between cryotherapy and SA; the latter suggesting that cryotherapy can also, like SA, be modestly effective.</P>
<P>It is difficult to draw firm conclusions from all these contradictory data about the different roles of SA and cryotherapy, but it remains true that there is still only limited evidence to support the use of cryotherapy, especially considering it is a more painful, hazardous, and expensive treatment when compared with SA. On the other hand, even though there is less evidence for its effectiveness, cryotherapy may work where SA has failed, and data from one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Bruggink-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Bruggink 2010</LINK>) showed this to be the case for warts on the hands.</P>
<P>The limited data on adverse effects, such as pain and blistering, suggest that these are more common with cryotherapy than with SA. However, it is also important to point out that participant satisfaction data suggest that these adverse effects do not seem to worry participants. More aggressive cryotherapy appears to be more effective than gentle cryotherapy, but with an increased risk of adverse effects. There is some evidence that SA combined with cryotherapy is more effective than SA alone.</P>
<P>Good quality data for most other treatments are still lacking.</P>
<P>Evidence for the efficacy of intralesional bleomycin remains limited. Two more recent left-right studies showed it to be more effective than cryotherapy, so taking into account the fact that caution is required when interpreting trials with this sort of design, there may be a place for bleomycin in selected people with refractory warts.</P>
<P>Topical immunotherapy with dinitrochlorobenzene, intralesional 5-fluorouracil, topical zinc, and silver nitrate are not commonly-used treatments. The limited available evidence suggest that these treatments may have a therapeutic effect, but none have any clear advantage over SA and cryotherapy. The limited data on dinitrochlorobenzene suggest that it might be substantially more effective than cryotherapy and SA (see <LINK TAG="IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH" TYPE="SECTION">Implications for research</LINK>), and so, again, there may be a place for topical immunotherapy with dinitrochlorobenzene (or other contact sensitisers, such as diphencyprone or squaric acid dibutylester, now probably in more common use than DNCB for refractory warts in specialist centres). The risk of troublesome allergic contact dermatitis (in the personnel who apply treatment, as well as those treated) needs to be taken into account when considering this treatment.</P>
<P>There is insufficient evidence to support the use of topical 5-fluorouracil, pulsed dye laser, photodynamic therapy, 80% phenol, 5% imiquimod cream, intralesional antigen, and topical alpha-lactalbumin-oleic acid.</P>
<P>Intralesional interferon did not appear to be effective.</P>
<P>There is no very convincing evidence that occlusive treatment with various types of duct tape is effective, and two relatively-recent trials that were newly included (<LINK REF="STD-de-Haen-2006" TYPE="STUDY">de Haen 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wenner-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Wenner 2007</LINK>) showed no significant difference in effectiveness between clear duct tape and placebo.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2012-08-07 19:09:03 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The problem of cutaneous warts lends itself well to randomised control trials because it is common and not-life threatening.</P>
<P>Despite a large number of published trials, only a minority are properly randomised and have an overall low risk of bias.</P>
<P>This updated review highlighted an apparent difference in response to treatment of warts at different body sites. Plantar warts (on the soles of the feet) appear to be a particular challenge, and any new trials should either concentrate on one body site or recruit sufficient numbers of participants with warts at each site to produce statistically-meaningful results.</P>
<P>A reasonable amount of data are now available for the most commonly-used treatments of cryotherapy and SA, although many of the included trials are small and have a significant risk of bias. Furthermore, larger studies of these treatments compared with each other and with placebo (using standardised treatment regimens) would be helpful.</P>
<P>Second- and third-line treatments are treatment for warts used after the initial treatment (first-line treatment) has failed. Finding treatments for refractory warts, such as those which fail first-line therapy, is a challenge. Data on many of the second- or third-line treatments mentioned above for refractory warts showed no advantage over cryotherapy or SA (which are generally used as first-line therapies). Perhaps the controlled studies with such first-line topical therapies have not been performed (and moreover are unlikely to be performed) because, generally, such second- or third-line treatments are reserved for those who have already failed first-line therapies.</P>
<P>Good quality studies of the more hazardous second-line treatments, such as intralesional bleomycin and topical immunotherapy (with dinitrochlorobenzene, diphencyprone, or squaric acid dibutylester), are definitely needed to provide clearer guidance for their use. Finally, the more 'surgical' treatments, such as photodynamic therapy, pulsed dye laser, and even the carbon dioxide laser (for which no randomised trials were found), require further study.</P>
<P>Trials using within-participant randomisation (e.g. left and right randomisation) and using individual warts as the unit of analysis are fraught with statistical and biological difficulties (<LINK REF="REF-Altman-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Altman 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Altman-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Altman 2002</LINK>) and should be discouraged. Quasi-randomised studies where allocation may be made alternately on the basis of birth date or hospital number are easy to manipulate. We excluded quasi-randomised studies from this review for that reason, and future studies should be conducted using adequate randomisation and allocation concealment methods, to minimise selection bias.</P>
<P>A reduced area or volume of warts is not a clinically-relevant end point, and sustained clearance of warts after a reasonable follow-up period of at least three months and preferably six months is to be encouraged as the standard end point. As none of the trials evaluated quality of life outcomes, quality of life issues related to treatment for warts remains an area that requires future research.</P>
<P>This review was updated in 2011 and will be updated as new trials become available.</P>

<P>In response to the following comment by Hans van der Wouden, "Analysis 1.1 and 1.2 are labelled "Topical salicylic acid (SA/LA) vs placebo", but this is incorrect. At least one of the studies included in this analysis (Bruggink 2010) was not placebo controlled. This can easily be solved by changing the label into &#8216;Topical salicylic acid (SA/LA) vs placebo/no treatment&#8217;, similar to the comparisons involving cryotherapy," the contact author, Sam Gibbs, acknowledged this and a correction was made.</P>

<B>Personal story received 3 December 2002</B>
</P>
<P>
<B>Summary - Verruca history</B>
</P>
<P>I suffered from verrucas for 5 years, having picked them up in a swimming pool abroad when I was 40 and ignored them until I moved back to England the following year. I finally went for treatment about a year after I had contracted them. On the doctor's advice, I filed my warts down with a foot file every night and tried all the wart paints on the market, both over-the-counter and on prescription, to no avail. I had the warts frozen with liquid nitrogen every fortnight at a wart clinic, which was painful and had no result - they quickly grew back. Finally, after a year's unsuccessful treatment, the doctor gave up and recommended me to the local hospital, where I saw a dermatologist after about a year's wait.</P>
<P>While I was waiting to see the specialist, the doctor suggested that I try homeopathy, since although it might not work, it should do me no harm. I duly went along to a homeopath, who (on payment of £25) listened to me sympathetically, drew pictures of my verruca-covered feet, and made notes about everything else that had recently happened in my life. He then gave me a few pills to take over a week, with the instruction to report back on any changes. There were no changes for either better or worse, so he made me some more pills for another £25, and then another batch for a further £25...eventually, after sampling quite a number of these tailor-made remedies, I was no better off and, indeed, somewhat poorer. I had no adverse side-effects, but my verrucas had not improved at all. The homeopath agreed that homeopathic treatment did not work for everyone, and gave up. By this time, both feet and the backs of my heels, were completely covered in verrucas.</P>
<P>As I was starting to think about being involved in an evidence-based education project, I looked up the Cochrane review on the web to discover what evidence there was for any treatment being effective, and I found that the evidence was inconclusive. I mentioned this to the dermatologist at the hospital, and he agreed with me, but thought he could try and laser one or two of my warts (both underneath my big toe). When he did this, my foot bled quite a lot, since the roots of one large verruca went down further than he had expected. It was also initially extremely painful, since the local anaesthetic had not worked properly, and I could feel that I was being burnt. (I was given more anaesthetic at this point, so at the end I could just smell the burning flesh but not actually feel it). The wound was dressed by a nurse at the hospital, and I was told to come back to the hospital for it to be redressed in a few days. However, the next night, when I had a shower with my foot encased in a plastic bag to avoid getting the wound wet, water unfortunately got into the bag, which I'd tied rather inexpertly round my leg, and the wound started bleeding and wouldn't stop. So I hobbled to the phone and phoned the NHS Helpline, and a nurse eventually rang me back about 45 minutes later and suggested that if it was still bleeding (which it was), I should tie a tea towel around it, which I did, and it eventually stopped.</P>
<P>The next day I went to see a nurse at my GP's practice, but although she redressed the wound for me, she didn't want to use the special blue pack filled with water, which I'd been told by the hospital to put onto the wound directly before dressing it, because she was unfamiliar with this material (as indeed I was). I should have insisted, but I didn't and put it back in my bag. When I went back to the hospital a few days later, the dressing had stuck inside the rather cavernous hole in my foot, and had to be soaked out. I then learnt how to dress the wound properly myself, so at least I learnt something from the experience. After this, I did not want to have any more warts lasered, and at the time, I suspected that my foot would be scarred for life (although this was not the case). On the advice of the dermatologist, I tried one more remedy - soaking my heel in a formaldehyde solution - another unpleasant procedure, which caused oedema and left me with the problem of disposing of the toxic solution (I poured it outside on the flowerbed, and it killed a primula).</P>
<P>I finally decided that since there wasn't any evidence that anything worked, I would stop treating my verrucas and, indeed, ignore them. I did this for a couple of months, and then, by chance, saw that the verrucas were disappearing from my foot - a wave of clear skin was appearing. The doctor was astonished on my next visit, and thought that perhaps the wound from my laser treatment had meant the virus had got into my blood stream and caused my immune system to finally kick back. At the time, I thought that it could also mean that doing nothing was just as effective as doing anything, since treatment does not necessarily work. However, I now think he was right. Wounding my foot seemed a rather drastic treatment at the time, but perhaps that was what was needed.</P>
<P>Anyway, the laser wound has now completely healed, and I only have one (rather large and painful) wart on the sole of my foot instead of having both feet completely covered with warts. (I also still have two warts on my right hand, but at one time I had a lot more.) So it is not a complete success story, and at 45 I still have some warts, but at least my feet don't hurt all the time, as they used to even when I was lying in bed.</P>
<P>From my own experience, I would agree with the Cochrane review that there is not much evidence for anything being a fool-proof way of curing warts - the one good thing about reading the evidence meant that I had information that was previously only accessible to doctors, and if there had been any treatment which had been proved to be effective, I would have found out about it. It also put me in a better position when discussing my problem with them. It is only a pity that no evidence has been found of an effective treatment, but perhaps if more people report their experiences, more comparative tests can be carried out in the future to see if what works for one person will work for others.</P>
