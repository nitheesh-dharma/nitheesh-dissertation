<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2008-08-05 17:43:20 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<P>This can cause urinary problems including pain, blood in the urine and reduced bladder capacity. A cycle of bleeding, infection and occasionally life-threatening complications can occur. Options include treating infections, blood transfusion, catheterisation, drugs inserted into the bladder, and surgery. This review found no evidence from trials to determine the effects of non-surgical treatments for late radiation cystitis, although some drugs inserted into the bladder may be advantageous.</P>
</SUMMARY_BODY>
</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Chronic radiation cystitis occurs a minimum of three months after completion of pelvic radiotherapy and represents a range of clinical symptoms for which there is as yet no recommended standard management.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>The aim of this review was to identify the various non-surgical treatment options for the management of late chronic radiation cystitis and evaluate the evidence.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>Synonyms for radiation therapy and for the spectrum of radiation toxicity to the bladder in both text and MeSH terms were combined and applied to a range of databases - Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Register 2001; MEDLINE 1966 to 2001; EMBASE 1980 to 2001; CANCERCD 1980 to 2001; Science Citation Index 1991 to 2001; CINAHL 1982 to 2001,and sources of grey literature. We also hand searched textbooks and contacted experts in the field. In the current update the search was updated to April 2007.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), studies of interventions for the non-surgical management of all grades of late radiation cystitis.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Out of 85 relevant studies, there was one RCT that met the inclusion criteria and a prospective series (phase II study), both of these used the same intervention. In addition, there were three prospective case series and two non-RCTs which assessed different interventions and were not comparable. </P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Sixty-five reports met the stated inclusion criteria. The majority were predominantly retrospective case series with the exception of one RCT which used an agent called WF 10 (Veerasaran 2004), there were also two unrandomised and unblinded studies with a control group for comparison of effect, (Micic 1988), (intravesical placental extract) and (Milani 1988), (flavoxate). There is also a phase II series using WF 10 therapy.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>Late radiation cystitis is a relatively uncommon treatment complication and there are obvious difficulties in identifying sufficient patients to participate in a RCT. The number of published reports is a reflection of the degree of medical interest that exists in providing therapeutic solutions for late radiation cystitis. However, in spite of the two studies of level IIA evidence and the solitary RCT it is difficult to draw any firm conclusions. </P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-08-05 17:44:32 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<P>Late radiation cystitis represents a spectrum of symptoms and clinical features occurring by definition, at least three months after completion of pelvic radiotherapy. Due to the proximity of the critical organs in the pelvis, field arrangements that produce late radiation toxicity in the bladder often occur in conjunction with similar changes in the rectum. The clinical manifestations of late radiation cystitis are urinary frequency, urgency, dysuria (pain or difficulty on passing urine), haematuria (blood in the urine), possible sphincter dysfunction, reduced bladder capacity, ulceration and the potential for perforation and fistulation (perforation into an adjacent organ).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Incidence, frequency and actuarial risk</HEADING>
<P>Delayed radiation toxicity in the bladder develops in a small but significant proportion of the treated population with frequencies quoted in the region of 5% to 10% depending on the series, grading system and the method of calculation that have been used. Although in one study, the crude incidence of late side effects affecting the bladder was 6.5%, encompassing all grades of severity, the actuarial risk of haematuria was 5.8% at five years increasing to 9.6% at 20 years. The median latent period before this condition develops is 35 months after completion of treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Levenback-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Levenback 1994</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Risk factors</HEADING>
<P>The development of late complications is multifactorial and includes predisposing factors relating to the patient, tumour and radiation technique. Pre-existing medical conditions such as diabetes, hypertension and unrelated abdominal surgery are an important consideration of potential toxicity. The tumour extent as determined by clinical assessment and staging determines the volume irradiated. In addition surgery, postoperative complications and chemotherapy are also critical in evaluating the baseline risk which may contribute to the development of late radiation morbidity. Precise radiation details including the volume treated, total bladder dose and fractionation (rate at which the radiotherapy treatments are given), external beam, brachytherapy (radiotherapy from a source close to the tissue being treated) component, prescription point, concurrent treatments and radiosensitivity are clearly implicated as predisposing factors for the development of late side-effects (<LINK REF="REF-Marks-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marks 1995</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Pathology, presentation and management of acute toxicity</HEADING>
<P>Acute radiation injury results primarily from damage to rapidly dividing cells such as bladder mucosa (lining). This usually occurs during the treatment period and persists for a short period of time. Stripping of the mucosa with an inflammatory response and tissue oedema (swelling) are the main histological features. Symptoms experienced are of dysuria, frequency and urgency, which are essentially self-limiting. Occasionally the acute radiation reaction may be prolonged and continue into a late reaction.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Pathology, presentation and management of late toxicity</HEADING>
<P>There is an extremely variable period between completion of radiotherapy and the manifestation of late toxicity in the bladder. This can range from a minimum of three months to a period of two to three years or more. The underlying pathology of late adverse effects is quite different to that seen in the acute reaction. Late responding tissues such as vascular (pertaining to blood vessels) and connective tissues have a slow turnover rate so that although they sustain radiation damage at the time of treatment this is not expressed until repeated cell division is attempted. Failure of successful stem cell regeneration then manifests itself and explains the interval in the development of clinical symptoms. The submucosa is the principle site of late radiation injury with microvascular damage and cell loss producing vascular insufficiency, fibrosis (formation of scar tissue) and ulceration. The resulting tissue hypoxia (lacking in oxygen/poorly oxygenated) and fibrosis, can progress to necrosis (cell death) and fistulation (abnormal opening between a body cavity and the surface/another body cavity). As the submucosa becomes fibrotic, bladder capacity reduces and vascular telangiectasia (permanent dilation of blood vessels usually in the skin or mucous membranes) develop. Ischaemia (low oxygen state due to inadequate blood flow in tissue) from the radiation induced endarteritis obliterans has been postulated to give rise to neo-vasculature which are fragile and prone to bleeds (<LINK REF="REF-Stewart-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stewart 1986</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Investigation</HEADING>
<P>Evaluation requires urinalysis and cultures for infection, and cystoscopy /IVP for assessment of structural changes. These are useful procedures to identify bleeding points, tumour recurrence and ureteral blockage. Further assessment of renal function may be performed if structural abnormalities are identified. Bladder biopsy is performed if there is a suspicion of recurrent tumour, with particular attention to the potential risk of perforation of the irradiated bladder wall (<LINK REF="STD-Cheng-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Cheng 1992</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Grading system</HEADING>
<P>Scoring systems for the severity of toxicity have variable criteria depending on the scoring system used. These include the Franco Italian glossary (<LINK REF="REF-Chassagne-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chassagne 1993</LINK>) and LENT-SOMA (<LINK REF="REF-Pavy-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pavy 1995</LINK>) where heavy protracted haematuria, which does not respond to conventional therapy is graded as a severe complication. In general, documentation of toxicity is often inconsistent making evaluation of responses to treatments difficult to assess when there is no objective score for comparison.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Treatment options for the management of late radiation morbidity in the bladder</HEADING>
<P>The main aspect of radiation cystitis that we focused on in this review were interventions for ischaemic, ulcerative and inflammatory components producing urgency, frequency, dysuria and bleeding. A vicious cycle of bleeding, clot retention, obstructive uropathy (disorder involving the urinary tract), sepsis and renal failure culminates in much morbidity and high mortality. Treatment for severe radiation cystitis may require hydration, treatment of infection, blood transfusion and bladder irrigation. Other treatments used have included:</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Intravesical (within the bladder) agents</HEADING>
<UL>
<LI>Alum irrigation: Alum works by protein precipitation when the bleeding is mild, alleviating capillary bleeding. In heavy bleeding the precipitant tends to clot in spite of three-way catheters for irrigation, leading to clot retention, distension and more bleeding (<LINK REF="STD-Arrizabalga-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Arrizabalga 1987</LINK>).</LI>
<LI>Formalin instillation: This is performed rarely but under general or regional anaesthesia after vesico-ureteric reflux (backup of urine into the kidney) has been excluded. Formalin is toxic even in very dilute 1% solution and a recognised adverse effect is that reflux may produce a bilateral pyonephrosis (distension of the kidney with pus formation) with fatal sepsis (<LINK REF="STD-Dewan-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Dewan 1993</LINK>), therefore use of this agent should be restricted to the treatment of intractable haemorrhage when the bladder has been diverted to prevent the impact of reflux.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Systemic therapies</HEADING>
<UL>
<LI>D-glucosamine is a precursor of glycosaminoglycans (GAG). Pentosan polysulphate is a semi-synthetic sulfated polysaccharide that serves as a synthetic GAG and is thought to adhere to the bladder surface supplementing the defective natural GAG layer (<LINK REF="STD-Parsons--1986" TYPE="STUDY">Parsons 1986</LINK>).</LI>
<LI>Oestrogens have been noted to have an effect in controlling haemorrhage in late radiation cystitis and it is postulated that this is related to stabilisation of vascular fragility.</LI>
<LI>An agent called WF 10 (TCDO, Oxoferin, Immunokine, Macrokine) is a 1:10 dilution of tetrachlorodecaoxide formulated for intravenous delivery. It was developed by Oxo Chemie in Switzerland as an adjunctive therapy to combination antiretroviral and opportunistic infection prophylaxis regimens in AIDS patients. WF 10 specifically targets macrophages. WF 10 has received regulatory approval in Thailand for post-radiation cystitis following a trial completed in 1998 in 20 patients who underwent radiation treatment for cervical carcinoma (<LINK REF="STD-Srisupundit-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Srisupundit 1999</LINK>). This authorisation also allows limited availability of WF 10 at the physician's request in Germany. WF 10 is approved for use in Thailand under the name IMMUNOKINE in patients with post-radiation chronic inflammatory disease including cystitis, proctitis and mucositis.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Procedures and radiological interventions</HEADING>
<P>Early cystoscopy with diathermy of the bleeding points before the bladder mucosa has suffered the trauma of repeated bladder washouts, infection, oedema clot retention and instillations is encouraged. Delayed cystodiathermy may not be as effective (<LINK REF="STD-Ravi-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Ravi 1994</LINK>).</P>
<P>If bleeding continues and fails to respond to medical management the following interventions have been reported: interruption of internal iliac arteries, bilateral percutaneous nephrostomies (drainage via a catheter inserted through the skin) and ileal diversion. In view of poor tissue healing, use of this therapeutic option is limited in the irradiated group. Devascularisation of this type carries the risk of further ischaemic complications in an already compromised field.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Treatments which attempt to reverse the radiation changes</HEADING>
<UL>
<LI>Analogues of the naturally occurring superoxide dismutase, which inhibits free radical production, have been used in the treatment of radiation cystitis for oedema and necrosis but also for the fibrotic component which reduces bladder capacity (<LINK REF="STD-Marberger-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Marberger 1981</LINK>).</LI>
<LI>Pentoxyfilline has been reported to contribute to the healing of late radiation injury by improving blood flow through compromised tissue, although whether there is evidence of this effect in cystitis will be evaluated (<LINK REF="STD-Dion-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Dion 1990</LINK>).</LI>
<LI>Hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) was first documented in 1986 and can be effective because of its angiogenic effect (promoting the regeneration of blood vessels), increasing vascular density and healing of hypoxic radiation damaged tissues. This requires a number of daily treatments and is clearly not suitable for those who are actively bleeding (<LINK REF="STD-Bevers-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Bevers 1995</LINK>). A practical concern with this type of treatment is that hyperbaric chambers are located at only a limited number of facilities.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>The optimum treatment for this type of clinical problem is not defined and the outcome of medical management can be disappointing. In this review of the interventions for the manifestations of late radiation cystitis we have evaluated the interventions for the non-surgical treatment options for dysuria, urgency, frequency and haemorrhagic components of cystitis and assess the evidence supporting efficacy.</P>

<STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<P>3508 references were identified, of these 85 were eligible.<BR/>The studies are described in <LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK>.</P>
</STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<STUDY_QUALITY>
<P>Of the 85 relevant studies, three were RCTs but two of these were excluded as they addressed the treatment or prevention of acute radiation cystitis. One RCT has been identitifed and is included (<LINK REF="STD-Veerasaran-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Veerasaran 2004</LINK>). Two studies were controlled but not randomised and were included in the review (<LINK REF="STD-Micic-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Micic 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Milani-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Milani 1988</LINK>). A prospective series/phase II study is included (<LINK REF="STD-Veerasaran-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Veerasaran 2006</LINK>) and a further three prospective case series (<LINK REF="STD-Bevers-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Bevers 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dion-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Dion 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Srisupundit-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Srisupundit 1999</LINK>),are mentioned briefly in the results section but not included in the statistical analysis. There were 62 retrospective case series that are also mentioned briefly in the results section but not analysed in detail and listed in the table of excluded studies as they are neither randomised nor controlled. The remainder were reviews. The two controlled studies mentioned are not randomised but have concurrent control groups and are included in the analysis as they fit the inclusion criteria. Therefore, in these studies there is no allocation concealment.</P>
</STUDY_QUALITY>
<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS MODIFIED="2008-08-05 17:54:29 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<P>The search strategy identified a number of studies outlining a range of interventions which are listed below. Although the majority are case series and are excluded from statistical analysis they are mentioned in the appropriate section and in the table of excluded studies. Letters to authors of controlled studies were sent requesting any outstanding data or unpublished data but no further information was available.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Intravesical agents</HEADING>
<P>A number of agents have been administered intravesically (into the bladder) for the purpose of alleviating the symptoms associated with late radiation cystitis. Although there are different potential mechanisms of action, the essential principle is sterilisation, lavage and arrest of focal bleeding points.<BR/>Aluminium - this is classified pharmacologically as an astringent- and acts by precipitating proteins on the cell surface and interstitial spaces accompanied by contraction, wrinkling and blanching of the surface. The cement substance of the capillary endothelium is hardened so that transcapillary movement of plasma protein is inhibited and local oedema, inflammation and exudation are reduced.<BR/>Placental extract- not previously described in the literature, is known to have an effect on the epithelialisation of venous ulcers when applied topically, and because of its wound-healing properties has been reported in this setting. Growth factors and angiogenic factors have been isolated in the early placenta and for this reason are thought to relate to the healing effect on the mucosa.<BR/>Prostaglandins- have been shown to protect the gastric and jejuno-ileal mucosa against ulceration by potentially increasing the levels of cAMP and stimulating the active transport of sodium.They are postulated to work in the same way with vesical ulceration by reducing the oedema and inflammatory response.</P>
<P>The search strategy used identified ten reports addressing this section, eight were in English, one in Spanish and one in Japanese. Eight of these studies fitted the inclusion criteria. Only one of the included studies, (<LINK REF="STD-Micic-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Micic 1988</LINK>) was a non-randomised trial of 35 patients with a concurrent control group (level IIA evidence), the remainder were retrospective series or case reports and a variety of therapeutic agents were utilised. The odds ratios for the two outcomes in <LINK REF="STD-Micic-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Micic 1988</LINK>, demonstrates the benefit of intravesical placental extract compared with a saline control and the duration of effect is 12 months. Morbidity was not reported and there was no treatment related mortality. The results of the case series are not reported because of the poor methodology and quality of data. The issue of QOL was not assessed in any of the references.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Intravesical formalin therapy</HEADING>
<P>Formalin is used therapeutically when there is severe vesical haemorrhage that has failed to respond to other treatments. Locally in the bladder formalin causes a precipitation of cellular proteins in the mucosa producing an occlusive and fixative action on telangiectatic tissue and small capillaries. For this reason care must be taken with the technique of administration including adequate protection of external skin to prevent caustic irritation.</P>
<P>The back diffusion of formalin into the suburothelial capillaries and open telangiectatic vessels leads to chemical cystitis, fixation of the bladder musculature and may result in a small contracted bladder. Formalin can also cause fixation of the intramural ureter leading to reflux or obstruction and subsequent hydronephrosis. Complications for the intravesical administration of this agent are proportional to the concentration of the solution used. The volume, pressure and duration of instillation may have consequences upon the degree of vesicoureteric reflex that can lead to the development of tubular necrosis, anuria (suppression of urine formation) or hydronephrosis (abnormal enlargement of the kidney). Therefore intravesical formalin should only be used when the bladder has been defunctioned by means of a urinary diversion.</P>
<P>The search strategy stated identified twenty-four references in this section. Nineteen fitted the inclusion criteria and five were excluded. Twenty-two were published in English and two were available in French and Japanese. All were case series. Of the nineteen reports all were retrospective case series and published between 1973 and 1997. They described the use of intravesical formalin therapy in 127 cases. Twelve studies used 10% formalin and the remainder used weaker concentrations. Although there is an impression that this therapy may be effective in the control of intractable haemorrhage of radiation cystitis, the reports cannot be analysed to give an overall estimate of effect and similarly the average duration of effect cannot be calculated because of the methodology and quality of this data. The toxicity appeared to rise with increasing concentration of formalin therapy and hydronephrosis and bladder fibrosis were reported in eight of the studies using 10% formalin therapy and four of the studies using weaker concentrations of formalin therapy. Therefore morbidity is not inconsiderable with this intervention and could be potentially fatal. QOL data was not reported in any of these references.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Thermal therapy</HEADING>
<P>Endoscopic laser coagulation can be performed under local anaesthesia and is an alternative method of control of vesical haemorrhage that arises from telangiectasia or neovasculature. This form of treatment is nonspecific and the effects are achieved by thermal coagulation of the bleeding mucosa, allowing the coagulated tissue to slough and leaving mucosal ulceration that subsequently heals with re-epithelisation. The bladder mucosa generally appears fibrotic. In mild cases only a few discrete areas of telangiectatic vessels are found, though in severe cases the whole bladder mucosa may be involved.</P>
<P>Using the stated search strategy eight references were identified in this category. All but one was published in English with one report published in Spanish. Five of the studies fitted the inclusion criteria and three were excluded. All of the included studies were retrospective case series (level IIIC evidence) and outline the management of a total of 82 cases treated with a form of coagulative laser therapy between 1970 and 1994. The instruments used are varied, one reference from 1970 refers to electrocoagulation, two refer to the use of cystodiathermy and two detail the use of the YAG laser. In view of the methodology the results of this series cannot be analysed, however, four of the five reports did demonstrate a beneficial effect. Only one case of morbidity is reported where treatment resulted in the development of a vesicorectal fistula (perforation producing communication between the bladder and rectum) which proved fatal. Six deaths were reported in total but relate to persistent bleeding rather than treatment related causes. In none of the reports was there any statistical analysis or a QOL assessment.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Interventional radiogy</HEADING>
<P>If haematuria from late radiation cystitis has failed to respond to other treatments, then percutaneous embolisation may be considered. Selective percutaneous embolisation of both vesical arteries is an alternative treatment to control severe haematuria caused by radiation with the recognised potential that such a form of devascularisation in an already compromised pelvis following the development of late radiation complications may well precipate frank ischaemic changes. Using the previously stated search strategy two reports were identified addressing this section, one of which was published in Spanish and the other in French. On closer inspection neither fitted the inclusion criteria. Therefore it is not possible at this stage to comment on the effectiveness of this intervention.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Systemic therapies</HEADING>
<P>Late radiation changes in the bladder ultimately impair the function of the epithelium which is unable to maintain the integrity of the bladder-urine interface permitting leakage of the substances that may lead to inflammation, further accelerating bladder destruction. Based on this principle, various agents have been used through systemic administration to enhance the integrity of the polysaccharide layer either by providing more anti-adherence, or compensation for other epithelial breakdown or reducing vascular fragility. The bladder surface partly contains a glycosaminoglycans (GAGS) that appears to have an important function in the cell surface. When this polysaccharide is present at the bladder surface it acts nonspecifically as an anti-adherence factor capable of blocking the attachment of bacteria, proteins and ions. This ability to block the adherence of many potentially harmful substances in the urine is postulated to be an important defence mechanism. Studies have demonstrated that this surface polysaccharide can be destroyed by the effects of late radiation damage and also replaced with many substitutes that may be equally if not more effective. The agents used in this setting are:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Glucosamine which is a precursor for GAGS</LI>
<LI>Pentosan polysulfate which is a sulphated polysaccharide with 3% to 5% of the administered dose being excreted in the urine. It is one of the heparinoids but has much less anti-coagulant activity than heparin itself. Experimentally it has been shown to reduce transitional cell injury by cytotoxins.</LI>
<LI>Oestrogen in its conjugated form has been shown to normalise the prolonged bleeding time and improve haemostasis (arrest of bleeding) in advanced renal failure. Although this is not the mode of action in late radiation cystitis, it is thought that conjugated oestrogen may have an effect on the capillary wall resulting in decreased vascular fragility.</LI>
<LI>TCDO/WF 10 is a chemically stabilised chlorite matrix that has pharmacological actions that include the promotion of immune functions and tissue repair by targeting macrophages. There is evidence that TCDO has a positive effect in several chronic inflammatory conditions including post-radiation damage.</LI>
</UL>
<P>Other agents include flavoxate which is an antimuscarinic agent used to treat urinary frequency; Newer anti-cholinergic agents include oxybutinin and terodiline, these agents increase bladder capacity by diminishing unstable contractions of the detrusor muscle.</P>
<P>Using the search strategy stated ten references were identified in this section, of which three failed to meet the inclusion criteria. Of the seven included references all were published in English. Four were retrospective case series (level IIIC evidence) and two were prospective case series, (<LINK REF="STD-Srisupundit-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Srisupundit 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Veerasaran-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Veerasaran 2006</LINK>) (level IIC). One study was an uncontrolled and unblinded comparison of two doses of the same agent, (<LINK REF="STD-Milani-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Milani 1988</LINK>) (level IIA) and (<LINK REF="STD-Veerasaran-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Veerasaran 2004</LINK>) was the RCT (level I).</P>
<P>The strongest evidence comes from (<LINK REF="STD-Veerasaran-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Veerasaran 2004</LINK>) using WF10 comparing standard therapy with WF10 and without. <LINK REF="STD-Milani-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Milani 1988</LINK> compared the effect of two doses of flavoxate on the clinical and urodynamic parameters in late radiation cystitis in an unblinded, unrandomised study of 34 cases. The remainder of the reports are either prospective or retrospective case series. Toxicities were only reported in one study by (<LINK REF="STD-Milani-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Milani 1988</LINK>) where five cases reported nausea and heartburn. The impact on QOL was not formally assessed in any of these reports and no cases of treatment related mortality were reported.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Superoxide dismutase agents</HEADING>
<P>The mechanism of late radiation changes relates to the generation of free radicals. The superoxide radical plays a primary role in initiating and sustaining biological damage and is responsible for the production of other free radicals and lipoperoxides. Thus it is presumed that the initiation and growth of fibrotic tissue results from the action of superoxide radicals and that cross-linking of chondroproteins and macromolecules to give this solidification is eventually limited in an equilibrium state. In vitro observations demonstrate that orgotein, a superoxide dismutase agent (SOD), protects lysosomes against heat or enzyme breakdown. In vivo it has been shown to mobilize polymorphonuclear cells and protect them against breakdown by release of the superoxide radical. Orgotein is a metalloprotein analogue of SOD which is a scavenging enzyme catalysing the destruction of the superoxide anion radicals formed by radiation. The anti-inflammatory effect depends on the elimination of cytotoxic superoxide radicals from the tissue.</P>
<P>Another method of approaching the treatment of radiation necrosis has been through the use of agents that improve blood flow through the narrowed microvasculature. One such drug is pentoxyfillene, a drug used to treat vascular occlusive disorders. This agent is able to improve blood flow through small capillaries by increasing red cell deformity by stimulating prostacyclin release. Therefore the vascular damage that may be associated with late radiation changes may be targeted in this way.</P>
<P>Using the stated search strategy ten references were identified in this section. Three were excluded because they addressed the issue of treatment and prevention of acute radiation cystitis and of these, two were randomised control trials. Of the seven included reports, one was published in German and the remainder were published in English. All of these were case series, one was prospective, (<LINK REF="STD-Dion-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Dion 1990</LINK>) (level IIC) and the rest were retrospective.</P>
<P>The seven reports in this section described the effects of Orgotein in six cases and pentoxyfillene in the remaining case. In total the reports were published between 1974 and 1990 and outline the effects on 72 cases in total. Of note is the fact the first three references by Marberger et al (<LINK REF="STD-Marberger-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Marberger 1974</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Marberger-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Marberger 1975</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Marberger-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Marberger 1981</LINK>)are essentially updates on a cumulative population with a degree of overlap. Only three of the reports used a scoring system to objectively assess the response to treatment. Response rates were available for each of the studies but because these were unrandomised and predominantly level IIIC evidence these response rates could not be combined, the same applies for the duration of response which was only available in five of the reports. In only one case was treatment-related toxicity noted and this was of anaphylactic shock. There were no reports of treatment related-mortality and QOL was not assessed in any of the reports.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Hyperbaric oxygen therapy</HEADING>
<P>The pathophysiology of late radiation injury is the same in all organs and is due to small vessel injury with endothelial damage, inflammation, fibrosis, ischaemia and necrosis. In theory hyperbaric oxygen has an effect on ischaemic and compromised tissue by increasing tissue oxygen tension necessary to support neovascularisation and to promote the formation of granulation tissue (tissue rich in blood supply that replaces the initial clot in a wound). The effect has certainly been very successful in osteoradionecrosis (necrosis of bone following radiation injury) of the mandible and has been extended to other sites of late radiation damage.</P>
<P>Using the search strategy stated, twenty references were identified in this section, of which nineteen fitted the stated inclusion criteria. Of these, two were published in Japanese requiring translation and the remainder were published in English. All the reports were case series and only one was a prospective series, (<LINK REF="STD-Bevers-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Bevers 1995</LINK>) (level IIC). Nineteen case series were included in this section detailing treatment with hyperbaric oxygen therapy for late radiation cystitis in reports published between 1985 and 1999. The level of evidence that these data represent is essentially IIIC, apart from one prospective case series of forty patients. Due to the selection, publication bias and methodology of these studies, these reports cannot be amalgamated to produce an overall response rate, but the minimum reported response for this intervention was 60%, for a minimum duration of two months. No formal scoring system was used in any of these reports and the impact that such an intensive treatment has on the QOL was only assessed informally in one report. Generally the treatment was well tolerated and only three reports mentioned treatment related toxicities in thirteen cases which were related to brief aural and visual barotrauma (trauma related to hyperbaric therapy). There were no reports of treatment-related fatalities.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Level IA study</HEADING>
<P>This was a multicentre randomised, two-arm, open label trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of WF10 as adjunct to standard treatment in the management of late radiation cystitis compared to standard treatment alone (<LINK REF="STD-Veerasaran-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Veerasaran 2004</LINK>). The patients were all women who had completed radiotherapy <U>+</U> at least six months earlier and had developed grade 2/3 late radiation cystitis. Patients were randomised 1:1 to one of two study groups one of which involved standard therapy with antibiotics, antispasmodics, iron supplements, blood transfusions and continuous bladder irrigation with evacuation of clots. The other group received not only standard therapy but in addition intravenous WF10 at a dose of 0.5 kg diluted in 250 ml of normal saline or 5% destrose administered in over two hours for five consecutive days every three weeks for two cycles. The method of randomisation is not documented and the paricipants were not blinded. The treatment period lasted lasted six weeks and there were 51 in each arm at the start of thetreatment but 50 in each group by completion. Evaluation was at 12, 24, 36 and 52 weeks or when symptoms occurred. The symptoms were evaluated using the subjective and objective toxicity criteria wity only the common parameters. Safety was assessed throughout with serial hameatological and biochemical markers. The patient characteristics in the two groups were comparable.</P>
<P>37/50 patients in the WF10 group showed complete resolution of objective haematuria compared with 32/50 in the standard therapy group (p = 0.28)<BR/>Among the responders 17/37 experienced a recurrence compared with 24/32 in the standard therapy arm (p = 0.01)</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Level IIA studies </HEADING>
<P>The first is a prospective observational study with a concurrent unrandomised control group (<LINK REF="STD-Micic-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Micic 1988</LINK>). Thirty-five women with established late radiation cystitis are discussed, and although the primary tumour is not described all had developed frequency, dysuria and intermittent haematuria at least three to six months after completion of pelvic radiotherapy. The use of previous therapies is not mentioned but the diagnosis was confirmed on cystoscopy and graded on mucosal appearance. The treatment arm consisted of 21 cases receiving placental extract dissolved in saline and instilled into a catheter retained in the bladder for at least two hours. This was repeated three times a week for the first month and then weekly for two months with monthly cystoscopies for four months and then at six months and one year. The control arm was treated in the same way but with saline alone instilled into the bladder. Blinding either of the patient or the clinicians is not referred to and neither is the selection process. Assessment was made on the clinical improvement and mucosal appearance. The findings on initial cystoscopy were grouped under three broad headings:</P>
<P>A - generalised redness and oedema of the bladder mucosa in the region of the trigone and posterior bladder wall<BR/>B - In addition to A, the presence of telangiectases<BR/>C- the presence of both A and B, but of a more severe nature plus pronounced incrustations of the mucosa</P>
<P>All patients in the treatment group had reported clinical improvement in their symptoms by three months. At 15 months after the beginning of the study all were free of urinary symptoms. In the control group eight showed an initial response at two months and six months, but six (grades B and C) were still complaining of frequency and dysuria.<BR/>The Cochrane Metaview programme gives an odds ratio (OR) for the effect of placental extract on the clinical improvement of symtoms of 32.9 (95%CI 1.66 to 650.0)<BR/>In terms of the condition of the bladder mucosa by the end of 12 months 18 out of 21 in the treatment group had improved whereas only five out of 14 in the control arm had improved. The Cochrane Metaview programme demonstrates that the OR for the effect of placental extract on the improvement in bladder mucosa is 10.8 (95%CI 2.1 to 55.7) No side effects were noted and QOL data was not available.</P>
<P>The second is a prospective pilot study of 34 cases, divided into two groups who received different doses of the same agent (<LINK REF="STD-Milani-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Milani 1988</LINK>). All were female and had received radiotherapy for cervical cancer a minimum of six months previously. Post radiotherapy they had all presented with micturition (passage of urine) disorders and urinary urgency. As a baseline clinical and urodynamic parameters were assessed. Symptoms including nocturnal frequency, urgency, dysuria and incontinence were scored on a 0 to 2 scale. Inclusion criteria were women over the age of 18, who had developed sensory or motor urinary incontinence following radiation therapy for cervical cancer and who had given consent. Women with stress incontinence, premorbid renal and hepatic impairment and those taking concomitant medication that would affect urinary function and continence were excluded. Cases were withdrawn if they were noncompliant, developed an intolerable side effect or an exclusion criteria.</P>
<P>This study was unblinded and unrandomised. Twenty-one received 600 mg daily of flavoxate and 13 women were given 1200 mg daily, for a period of four weeks. Baseline characteristics in both groups were similar as assessed by the unpaired Student t test. Response was assessed by change in clinical score (Wilcoxon's signed rank test, within group and the Mann-Whitney U test between groups) and urodynamic parameters were analysed by variance using the Tukey test. A total score reduction of more than 75% was classed as a cure. The clinical symptom scores, compared with the baseline, showed highly significant reductions in both groups. Complete responses occured in eight out of 13 in the 1200 mg group and nine out of 21 in the 600 mg group. The difference between groups was not statistically significant. This was also confirmed by the odds ratio which crosses one. The effect on the urodynamic parameters showed that the volume of the bladder at capacity and the pressure at capacity were clinically and statistically superior at the 1200mg dose. These values were entered into the Cochrane Metaview programme allowing for the fact that the groups were unblinded and unrandomised. The four parameters compared to the assessed baseline were as follows:<BR/>The change in bladder pressure at first desire was not statistically significant for either group with a weighted mean difference (WMD) of -2.0 (95%CI -3.76 to -0.24) favouring an increase in pressure with 600 mg of flavoxate.<BR/>The volume of fluid in the bladder at first desire increased significantly with both doses but more so with the 1200 mg of flavoxate and a WMD of 27 (95%CI 14.67 to 39.33).<BR/>The reduction in the bladder at capacity was statistically significant only for the 1200 mg group with a WMD of 8.3 (95%CI 1.2 -to 15.39).<BR/>The increase in bladder volume at capacity was only statistically significant for the 1200 mg group with a WMD of 34.0 (95%CI 9.72 to 58.28)<BR/>Five women had minor side effects of nausea and heartburn (three in the 600 mg group and two in the 1200 mg group) and QOL data was not available.</P>
<P>The third was a phase II study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of WF10 in patients with late haemorrhagic radiation cystitis and proctitis (<LINK REF="STD-Veerasaran-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Veerasaran 2006</LINK>). Thirty patients who had undergone radiotherapy <U>+</U> chemotherapy as part of radical treatment for carcinoma of the cervix at least six months ago were recruited, 16 of whom had cystitis and 14 had proctitis. The diagnosis had been confirmed endoscopically as grade 2/3. All were treated with intravenous WF10 , the dose was 0.5 mg/kg diluted in 250 ml of normal saline or 5% dextrose and administered over 2 hours for 5 consecutive days every three weeks for two to four cycles combined with standard therapy as outlined in the RCT by the same author. The patients were clinically followed every three weeks for the first 3 months and then three monthly for the first year and three to six monthly. The study endpoints were immediated resolution of bleeding with improvement to grade 0-1within 3 months and recurrence to grade 2 or more during the follow up period.</P>
<P>After completion of therapy 14/16 cystitis patients had imnptroved to grade 0-1 haematuria and 14/14 proctitis patients had a reduction in their rectal bleeding. The median follow up time was 51 months and within that time 4/14 cystitis patients had recurrent symptoms and 2/14 proctitis patients also developed further bleeding PR. No treatment toxicity was observed.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>In total 65 studies were included. The majority were retrospective case series with the exception of two trials which were unrandomised studies with a control group for comparison of effect. Although these two trials, (<LINK REF="STD-Micic-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Micic 1988</LINK>) (intravesical placental extract) and (<LINK REF="STD-Milani-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Milani 1988</LINK>), (flavoxate) which have assessed quite different parameters and cannot be compared. Furthermore (<LINK REF="STD-Veerasaran-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Veerasaran 2004</LINK>) published an RCT using WF10 therapy and a phase II study in 2006 which compares different outcomes but shows favourable results.</P>
<P>Late radiation complications affecting the bladder have a varied presentation and are affected by the type of tumour treated, its stage, other interventions such as surgery and chemotherapy, comorbid disease and of course technical factors such as the biologically effective dose, tissue tolerance and radiation hotspots in the treated volume. This information should ideally be available to apply some rationale to the degree of morbidity that has developed but is rarely documented in published studies. The clinical features of late radiation bladder complications are not unique and may be produced by recurrent tumour or infection, therefore the diagnostic processes used to establish the diagnosis of RT toxicity should be clearly stated, as should the severity of the radiation toxicity using validated scores such as the Franco Italian Glossary (FIGO), RTOG, and LENT-SOMA, but this information is rarely presented. Moreover, in a chronic and debilitating condition such as late radiation cystitis where the changes may be potentially irreversible the effect on QOL is critical and should be interpreted formally with the physical effects of the treatment. This information was omitted in all the included studies.This lack of precision in the quality of reporting details affects the interpretation of the treatment effect and prohibits pooling of cases.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>In a relatively rare condition there are obvious difficulties in identifying enough cases to participate in a randomised controlled trial. The number of published reports is a reflection of the degree of medical interest that exists in providing treatments for the managment of late radiation cystitis. Unfortunately the small numbers in the case series and methodology means that the data derived, despite the solitary RCT, is not enough to influence current trends in clinical practice other than that based on anecdotal and experiential knowledge. However they could form the basis of a multicentre randomised controlled trials to provide the evidence to subsequently implement changes and make recommendations. This would require a consensus of opinion from a multidisciplinary group of clinicians with experience in this field to decide on the specific characteristics for defining late radiation cystitis, the use of a universally accepted grading system and a hierarchy of the most effective treatment options from those listed in the review.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>One way of increasing the number of cases with confirmed late radiation cystitis that may be suitable for treatment with the interventions outlined would be to create a database of such cases with central registration, uniform baseline assessments and formal standardised grading of the toxicity. In such a setting interventions could be administered in a multicentre trial so that small numbers of cases per centre could be pooled to provide results with consistently performed outcome assessments and significant clinical impact. Given the implications of late radiation toxicity this would be an ideal opportunity to collect parallel data regarding the effect that the treatment offered has on QOL issues but would require appropriate recognition, funding, manpower and commitment to institute this in practical terms.</P>
