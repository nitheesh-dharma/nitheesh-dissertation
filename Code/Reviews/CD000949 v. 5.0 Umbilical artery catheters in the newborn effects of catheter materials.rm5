<CONDITION MODIFIED="2009-07-30 21:57:28 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Umbilical arterial catheters (UACs) are among the most commonly used monitoring methodologies in neonatal intensive care. There seems to be significant variance between neonatal intensive care units in exactly how these catheters are used. This variance involves heparin dosing, catheter materials and catheter design, and positioning of the catheter. Immediately after insertion of a UAC local vascular compromise is frequently evident, usually in the form of blue or white toes, but occasionally with more severe and extensive ischemic manifestations. Aortic thrombi and renal ischemia have also been described. Some epidemiologic and case control studies have also shown that use of umbilical artery catheterisation is statistically associated with the later development of necrotizing enterocolitis. In order to minimize these morbidities some aspects of the use of UACs have been subjected to a small number of randomized control trials.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2009-07-30 21:57:55 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review will analyze the data regarding the rates of complications relating to the material from which the catheter is constructed.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2009-07-30 21:57:53 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Some newer plastics (carbon polymers) are said to be less thrombogenic than standard polyvinylchloride (PVC) and catheters may also be coated with heparin to further reduce 'thrombogenicity'. Heparin coated catheters may also decrease sepsis rates by inhibiting bacterial adherence to the catheter (<LINK REF="REF-Mermel-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mermel 1993</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Appelgren-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Appelgren 1996</LINK>). Thus, the availability of heparin bonded catheters made from newer plastics requires clinical testing to ensure that the safest catheters are used. In adult intensive care it has also been shown that bonding of antimicrobial agents to the surface of the catheter decreases catheter-associated sepsis. Both cefazolin (<LINK REF="REF-Kamal-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kamal 1991</LINK>) and chlorhexidine/silver sulphadiazine (<LINK REF="REF-Maki-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maki 1991</LINK>) have been investigated and appear to be effective.</P>
<P>Other materials such as 'Silastic', a silicon based polymer, are used for construction of many different medical devices, with the putative advantage of reduced biologic interactions. Such materials could also potentially decrease complication rates from umbilical arterial catheterization. Some of the early animal studies of silastic catheters showed a reduction in thrombosis rates (<LINK REF="REF-Welch-1974" TYPE="REFERENCE">Welch 1974</LINK>); however, others were unable to show any effect (<LINK REF="REF-Andrews-1973" TYPE="REFERENCE">Andrews 1973</LINK>). There are no clear benefits in adults from the use of silastic catheters (<LINK REF="REF-Reed-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reed 1995</LINK>).</P>

<STUDY_DESCRIPTION MODIFIED="2009-10-28 14:13:23 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The original search strategy retrieved 849 articles. These were further reduced by restricting the search by use of the terms prospective, random#, control#, comparative or clinical. When studies of animal subjects and of epidural catheterisation were also removed, 233 reports remained. The abstract of each was read individually to determine if there was a possibility that the papers were reporting randomized prospective controlled trials. This final examination revealed two trials investigating catheter materials. The updated search in November 1998 revealed no new randomized trials of catheter materials.</P>
<P>Only one of the two trials which were detected was randomised (<LINK REF="STD-Jackson-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Jackson 1987</LINK>). The authors compared standard PVC to heparin bonded polyurethane in 125 term and preterm infants in a single center over 16 months. This study was unblinded and used random assignment using sequentially numbered sealed envelopes. Catheter group assignment was not stratified by weight but well balanced groups were achieved. Catheter size was either 3.5 or 5 Fr at the discretion of the physician. Catheters were placed in a high position. Heparin was not used in the infusate and a small quantity was used in the flushing procedure. The primary outcome variable was "clots or associated complications" with aortic thrombosis being detected by routine ultrasound at about three and about 11 days of age. Secondary outcomes were hypertension, persistent blanching of the feet or legs, duration of useful catheter function. There were originally 144 infants randomized, 19 were excluded after randomization (16 of them because catheter insertion was unsuccessful, three because the physician changed his mind) to leave 125 in which a catheter was inserted; all data are reported from these 125 infants. There was a decrease in numbers between study entry and ultrasound examination which appears to be because many catheters were removed before the scheduled ultrasound examination dates; thus 114 early ultrasounds were performed and 105 at the later time. Other outcomes, such as hypertension and clinical ischemic compromise were reported on almost all the infants (122/125).</P>
<P>Boros et al (<LINK REF="STD-Boros-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Boros 1975</LINK>) compared the incidence of aortic thrombosis by aortography in 10 infants with PVC catheters and 10 infants with a silastic catheter. The study was not randomized; therefore, this study was excluded from the analysis. Contrast aortograms were performed at the time of removal of the catheter. During the period of the study there were other infants in the same NICU who had silastic catheters and were not included in the study. It appears that the reason for being included in this report was the performance of an aortogram. The aortograms showed that nine of the infants with PVC catheters had a thrombus compared to one of the infants with a silastic catheter.</P>

<P>

</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Jackson-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Jackson 1987</LINK> showed no benefit of substituting a heparin bonded polyurethane catheter for the usual PVC catheter in terms of the incidence of aortic thrombosis in this trial involving 125 infants. RR for aortic thrombosis after a mean of 11.1 days was 0.63 (95% CI 0.34, 1.18) (Outcome 1.3). There was also no statistically significant effect on other outcomes: RR for persistent hypertension was 5.00 (95% CI 0.25, 102.4) (Outcome 1.1) and for clinical vascular compromise was 1.00 (95% CI 0.45, 2.23) (Outcome 1.4). The results do not clearly describe how many of the catheters themselves became occluded, although the duration of useful catheter function was said to be not different between groups.</P>
<P>Other important outcomes such as mortality, intraventricular hemorrhage, necrotising enterocolitis and sepsis were not reported.</P>
</INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>This review provides no basis for choosing any catheter material over standard PVC at the present. As complications of umbilical arterial catheterization are frequent, further research into this issue is warranted. Heparin bonded catheters may be associated with a lower risk of infections in other populations. This is an important outcome which was not reported in Jackson's paper, and should be further investigated.<BR/>Silastic catheters could potentially have a much lower incidence of aortic thrombi than PVC; however, the research design of <LINK REF="STD-Boros-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Boros 1975</LINK> allows many potential biases which should be resolved by further study.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>There are no demonstrated clinically relevant differences in outcomes between the use of PVC catheters and other materials. Therefore, other considerations such as price and ease of availability may dictate the catheter chosen.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Introduction of newer catheter materials should be compared to PVC in prospective randomized controlled trials. Silastic catheters, which are currently readily available, have not been demonstrated by reliable studies to be an improvement over PVC, and warrant adequately powered prospective investigation.</P>
