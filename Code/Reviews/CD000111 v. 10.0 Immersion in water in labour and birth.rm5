<P>This review includes 12 trials (3243 women). Water immersion during the first stage of labour significantly reduced epidural/spinal analgesia requirements, without adversely affecting labour duration, operative delivery rates, or neonatal wellbeing. One trial showed that immersion in water during the second stage of labour increased women's reported satisfaction with their birth experience. Further research is needed to assess the effect of immersion in water on neonatal and maternal morbidity. No trials could be located that assessed the immersion of women in water during the third stage of labour, or evaluating different types of pool/bath.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2011-11-10 16:09:13 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review includes 12 trials (3243 women): eight related to just the first stage of labour: one to early versus late immersion in the first stage of labour; two to the first and second stages; and another to the second stage only. We identified no trials evaluating different baths/pools, or the management of third stage of labour.</P>
<P>Results for the first stage of labour showed there was a significant reduction in the epidural/spinal/paracervical analgesia/anaesthesia rate amongst women allocated to water immersion compared to controls (478/1254 versus 529/1245; risk ratio (RR) 0.90; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.82 to 0.99, six trials). There was also a reduction in duration of the first stage of labour (mean difference -32.4 minutes; 95% CI -58.7 to -6.13). There was no difference in assisted vaginal deliveries (RR 0.86; 95% CI 0.71 to 1.05, seven trials), caesarean sections (RR 1.21; 95% CI 0.87 to 1.68, eight trials), use of oxytocin infusion (RR 0.64; 95%CI 0.32 to 1.28,five trials), perineal trauma or maternal infection. There were no differences for Apgar score less than seven at five minutes (RR 1.58; 95% CI 0.63 to 3.93, five trials), neonatal unit admissions (RR 1.06; 95% CI 0.71 to 1.57, three trials), or neonatal infection rates (RR 2.00; 95% CI 0.50 to 7.94, five trials).</P>
<P>Of the three trials that compared water immersion during the second stage with no immersion, one trial showed a significantly higher level of satisfaction with the birth experience (RR 0.24; 95% CI 0.07 to 0.80).</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2011-07-19 09:52:14 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Denise Atherton">
<P>Evidence suggests that water immersion during the first stage of labour reduces the use of epidural/spinal analgesia and duration of the first stage of labour. There is limited information for other outcomes related to water use during the first and second stages of labour, due to intervention and outcome variability. There is no evidence of increased adverse effects to the fetus/neonate or woman from labouring in water or waterbirth. However, the studies are very variable and considerable heterogeneity was detected for some outcomes. Further research is needed.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2011-08-23 10:43:17 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review is one in a series of Cochrane reviews examining pain management in labour. These reviews contribute to an overview of systematic reviews of pain management for women in labour (<LINK REF="REF-Jones-2011a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jones 2011a</LINK>), and share a generic protocol (<LINK REF="REF-Jones-2011b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jones 2011b</LINK>).</P>
<P>Throughout this review, 'water immersion' refers to the immersion in water by a pregnant woman during any stage of labour (first, second, third) where the woman's abdomen is completely submerged. This implies the use of a receptacle that may be called a pool, tub or bath, and which is larger than a normal domestic bath. The period of immersion by the woman may be for one or more stages of labour, and for any duration. Labour is understood to be as defined by the woman or clinicians at the time, and includes regular painful uterine contractions, leading to full cervical dilation, expulsion of the fetus, and the placenta and membranes.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">History</HEADING>
<P>The use of water immersion as a therapeutic medium is not new. Its exact origins are unknown, but there is evidence of immersion in water being used as a treatment for physical and psychological ill health by the Chinese, Egyptians, Japanese and Assyrians, as well as Greeks and Romans (<LINK REF="REF-Reid-Campion-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reid Campion 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Reid_x002d_Campion-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reid-Campion 1997</LINK>). Warm water immersion during labour, including birth, used for relaxation and pain relief, has a long history in lay and clinical care (<LINK REF="REF-Garland-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Garland 2000</LINK>). Igor Tjarkovsky, a Russian boat builder, stimulated the foundation of a movement to promote waterbirth in Soviet Russia in the 1970s. He became convinced of the benefits of water immersion as a means of maximising physiological potential. Michel Odent subsequently popularised water immersion in other European countries (<LINK REF="REF-Odent-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Odent 1983</LINK>). Although considered a fad by some, the use of water during labour and birth appeals to both women and their carers, particularly those striving for a woman-centred, intervention free, 'normal' experience. In 1995, the first international waterbirth conference was held in London, followed by many subsequent study events and international conferences.</P>
<P>Official acceptance of the use of water immersion as a care option during labour came in the UK in 1993, with the publication of the Changing Childbirth report (<LINK REF="REF-Department-of-Health-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Department of Health 1993</LINK>), which recommended that a pool facility should be an option available to women in all UK maternity units. Professional recognition of the use of water during labour and birth came in 1994 when both the Royal College of Midwives (<LINK REF="REF-RCM-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">RCM 1994</LINK>) and the United Kingdom Central Council for Nursing, Midwifery and Health Visiting (<LINK REF="REF-UKCC-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">UKCC 1994</LINK>) published position statements, which incorporated water immersion during labour into the role of the midwife. The use of water during labour/birth is now integrated in the UK Midwifery Rules and standards (<LINK REF="REF-Nursing-and-Midwifery-Council-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nursing and Midwifery Council 2010</LINK>), and UK policy for maternity services with section 8.4 of the National Service Framework for Children, Young People and Maternity Service (<LINK REF="REF-Department-of-Health-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Department of Health 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>Most of the evidence on the use of water immersion is based on observational studies (<LINK REF="REF-Garland-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Garland 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Garland-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Garland 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Geissbuehler-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Geissbuehler 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ohlsson-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Ohlsson 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Thoeni-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thoeni 2005</LINK>). A tension has arisen with regard to the perceived acceptability of randomised controlled trial (RCT) design, as some midwives and women perceive this as obviating maternal choice to what is now a widely available option, while women with strong preferences may decline to participate (<LINK REF="REF-Garland-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Garland 1994</LINK>). Factors such as depth of water, size of the pool and whether the water is still or aerated/whirlpool water have not been compared, as pool design and practice have tended to be based on local availability and customs.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="2">Water immersion during first stage of labour - what it offers women</HEADING>
<P>The positive physiological effects of hydrotherapy such as buoyancy, hydrostatic pressure, and associated thermal changes, are relevant to women labouring in water, where labour is defined as including the first, second (birth) and third stages. The buoyancy of water enables a woman to move more easily than on land (<LINK REF="REF-Edlich-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Edlich 1987</LINK>). This can facilitate the neuro-hormonal interactions of labour, alleviating pain, and potentially optimising the progress of labour (<LINK REF="REF-Ginesi-1998a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ginesi 1998a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ginesi-1998b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ginesi 1998b</LINK>). Water immersion may be associated with improved uterine perfusion, less painful contractions, a shorter labour with fewer interventions (<LINK REF="REF-Aird-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aird 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Garland-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Garland 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moneta-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moneta 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Otigbah-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Otigbah 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Geissbuehler-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Geissbuehler 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Thoeni-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thoeni 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zanetti_x002d_Daellenbach-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zanetti-Daellenbach 2007</LINK>). In addition, the ease of mobility that water immersion offers women may optimise fetal position by encouraging flexion (<LINK REF="STD-Ohlsson-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Ohlsson 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>Hydrotherapy has marked physiological effects on the cardiovascular system (<LINK REF="REF-Cefalo-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cefalo 1978</LINK>). Shoulder-deep warm water immersion reduces blood pressure due to vasodilatation of the peripheral vessels and redistribution of blood flow. It is suggested that water immersion during labour increases maternal satisfaction and sense of control (<LINK REF="REF-Hall-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hall 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Richmond-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Richmond 2003</LINK>). A woman who feels in control during childbirth experiences greater emotional wellbeing postnatally (<LINK REF="REF-Green-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Green 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>The UK is promoting water immersion during labour and waterbirth as a means of empowering women and is consistent with the current agenda of normalising birth (<LINK REF="REF-Royal-College-of-Midwives-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Royal College of Midwives 2011</LINK>), the consensus statement from the maternity Care Working Party (<LINK REF="REF-Maternity-Care-Working-Party-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maternity Care Working Party 2007</LINK>); both of whom use a waterbirth image to illustrate normal birth, as does the Vision for Midwifery expressed by the Midwifery 2020 programme (<LINK REF="REF-Midwifery-2020-Program-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Midwifery 2020 Program 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>Although the use of additives such as essential oils to the water appears to be gaining popularity (<LINK REF="STD-Calvert-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Calvert 2000</LINK>), to date no trial has generated reliable evidence to support or refute the use of any additive.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Waterbirth (second stage of labour) - what it offers women</HEADING>
<P>It has been suggested that waterbirth may reduce the uptake of pharmacological pain relief and likelihood of perineal trauma (<LINK REF="REF-Burke-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burke 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Burns-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burns 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Garland-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Garland 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Geissbuehler-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Geissbuehler 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Otigbah-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Otigbah 2000</LINK>). There may also be increased maternal satisfaction with the birth experience.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Water immersion and the fetus/neonate (first and/or second stage)</HEADING>
<P>It could be argued that the fetus benefits from a relaxed mother, as this maximises placental oxygen perfusion. 'Nature's opiates', endogenous endorphins, predominate. When the mother is not fearful, oxytocin is released to stimulate effective contractions. Labouring in water, compared to land, has been found to reduce stress hormones, catecholamines, which inhibit oxytocin and labour progress. The fetus may be more likely to adopt a flexed position, because the mother can easily explore different positions to maximise her pelvic diameters if the pool is sufficiently large (<LINK REF="STD-Ohlsson-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Ohlsson 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>Concerns raised in a survey and case reports about birth in water for the baby include 1) thermoregulation during labour, 2) infection, 3) respiratory difficulties and 4) snapped cord (<LINK REF="REF-Gilbert-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gilbert 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kassim-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kassim 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mammas-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mammas 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nguyen-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nguyen 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pinette-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pinette 2004</LINK>).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">1. Thermo regulation</HEADING>
<P>As with any labouring woman, it is important to avoid her becoming pyrexial. Therefore, the water temperature of a pool should not exceed the maternal body temperature, as immersing a woman in water above her natural core temperature will result in fetal hyperthermia and associated cardiovascular and metabolic disturbances (<LINK REF="REF-Johnson-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnson 1996</LINK>). High temperatures have been identified as a safety issue by several authors as being associated with fetal mortality and morbidity, based on individual case studies and/or theory (<LINK REF="REF-Deans-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deans 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Johnson-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnson 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rosevear-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rosevear 1993</LINK>). The theory underpinning this was originally based on a study on pregnant ewes (<LINK REF="REF-Cefalo-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cefalo 1978</LINK>). The fetus responded to an increase in maternal temperature by becoming tachycardiac, reducing resistance in the placenta bed and thus heat dissipation. As the temperature increased, there was a tendency to exceed the heat that could be dissipated by the placenta, leading to an increased risk of fetal mortality (<LINK REF="REF-Cefalo-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cefalo 1978</LINK>). A review of the literature on temperature control in mammalian fetuses, mainly sheep, primates and a limited number of human participants, identified that the fetal metabolic processes produce heat (<LINK REF="REF-Power-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Power 1989</LINK>). This heat is transferred to the mother primarily via the circulatory system, the umbilical cord and placenta where the large surface area and constant blood flow facilitate heat transfer. A second pathway for heat transfer is via fetal skin, to amniotic fluid, the uterus and maternal system. To enable this heat transfer, the fetus is 0.5<SUP>o</SUP>C warmer than the mother. This difference is apparently constant across species, although the basal temperatures differ (<LINK REF="REF-Power-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Power 1989</LINK>). When maternal temperature increases, heat transfer is inhibited and the fetal temperature rises, until transfer is again possible. However, there is a concomitant rise in metabolic activity and oxygen demands as temperature increase, the effect of which may be seen in fetal heart rate changes, and which may contribute to fetal compromise during labour. Temperature regulation, and its assessment, are therefore important during labour/birth irrespective of the use of water immersion.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">2. Respiration</HEADING>
<P>The diving reflex prevents a healthy baby born in water from drowning. This is an apnoea on expiration (the opposite of an adult who dives having taken a breath), with a closed larynx. The fetal larynx has a myriad of airway chemoreceptors which prevent fluid aspiration. The diving reflex is stimulated via facial skin receptors conveying stimuli along the trigeminal nerve, triggered as these receptors make contact with the water (<LINK REF="REF-Johnson-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnson 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>Fetal breathing is inhibited at the hypo-pharynx. This mechanism is associated with hormonal factors such as prostaglandin and adenosine; sensors in the oral pharynx, including free nerve endings/taste buds, prevent aspiration, and indeed the normal mechanism is that any lung fluid rising into the oro-pharynx is swallowed. Mild hypoxia further inhibits breathing until chronic sub lethal override point, leading to the belief that an uncompromised human neonate will not breathe under water (<LINK REF="REF-Johnson-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnson 1996</LINK>). A compromised neonate born underwater has the potential to gasp before the nose and mouth are above the surface, thus inhaling bath water into the lungs. Inhalation of even a small quantity of fresh water can be absorbed quickly into the circulation causing appreciable haemodilution and fluid overload - as seen in fresh water drowning.</P>
<P>There have been two reports of neonatal death following waterbirth attended by a midwife (<LINK REF="REF-Burns-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burns 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rosser-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rosser 1994</LINK>). These adverse outcomes are very rare, and causality cannot be inferred on the evidence to directly link the reported case studies of rare adverse outcomes with waterbirth.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">3. Infection</HEADING>
<P>It has been suggested that fetal/neonatal infection may occur due to cross-contamination from the water and pool, and from the woman (<LINK REF="REF-Hawkins-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hawkins 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rawal-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rawal 1994</LINK>). However, several comparative studies, cohort studies, and audits report no increase risk of infection for the fetus/neonate (<LINK REF="REF-Alderdice-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alderdice 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Anderson-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anderson 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Eriksson-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Eriksson 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Otigbah-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Otigbah 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rush-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Rush 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Robertson-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Robertson 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zanetti_x002d_Daellenbach-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zanetti-Daellenbach 2007</LINK>). As with all maternity provision, it is incumbent upon practitioners to ensure they have appropriate cleaning protocols for labour and birthing pools, and employ universal precautions.</P>
<P>To date, there is no evidence of increased maternal, fetal or neonatal risk associated with water immersion, compared with labouring and giving birth on land. Two UK national surveys were undertaken during the 1990s: <LINK REF="REF-Alderdice-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alderdice 1995</LINK> included 2885 women and their neonates, while <LINK REF="REF-Gilbert-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gilbert 1999</LINK> evaluated the neonatal outcomes for 4032 infants. Both surveys indicated that there was no reliable evidence to justify denying the choice of water immersion for labour and/or birth to women at low risk of complications. In addition, multiple cohort studies/audits have suggested the safety of water immersion during labour and birth for women at low risk of complication (<LINK REF="REF-Garland-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Garland 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Geissbuehler-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Geissbuehler 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Otigbah-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Otigbah 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Thoeni-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thoeni 2005</LINK>). RCTs have been conducted which are the focus of this review.</P>
<P>Maternal adverse effects of water immersion during labour have been theorised. These include the possibility that it may promote unrealistic expectations about labour, restrict choice of analgesia, restrict mobility, reduce contraction effectiveness, and increase perineal trauma (<LINK REF="REF-McCandlish-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">McCandlish 1993</LINK>). Increased risk to the mother of infection caused by water entering the uterus has been proposed (<LINK REF="REF-Rosevear-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rosevear 1993</LINK>). If warmth has a relaxing effect on the uterine muscles, the uterus may contract less efficiently postpartum (<LINK REF="REF-Church-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Church 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Deans-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deans 1995</LINK>). A theoretical risk of water embolism has been hypothesised (<LINK REF="REF-Odent-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Odent 1983</LINK>). The logic of this hypothesis has been challenged (<LINK REF="REF-Wickham-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wickham 2005</LINK>). To date no studies have reported an association between water immersion during labour/birth with this adverse event.</P>

<P>Concerns have been raised about the dangers of umbilical cords at water births (<LINK REF="REF-Gilbert-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gilbert 1999</LINK>). Cords also snap in land births; there are however, no data for this. Cord snaps associated with waterbirth may be related to undue traction exerted on the cord as the baby is lifted out of the water.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="2">Water immersion during labour and birth: what it offers caregivers</HEADING>
<P>Labour and birth is a complex, multifaceted and major life event encompassing physiological, emotional, psychological and social elements. It is therefore highly individualised and its features and outcome cannot be predicted with certainty. Although much of health care is based on understanding pathology and ill health, and while that may be appropriate for some, in maternity care, women are experiencing a normal physiological process. Midwives Downe and McCourt (<LINK REF="REF-Downe-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Downe 2004</LINK>) advocate that midwifery care should be set in the context of salutogenesis.</P>
<P>The salutogenic theory originated from interviews conducted with Israeli women who had survived the Holocaust about their time in concentration camps during the Second World War. It was noted that some stayed healthy despite horrendous experiences. This epidemiological study stimulated sociologist Antonovsky to develop the salutogenic paradigm as a way of focusing on health rather than disease (<LINK REF="REF-Antonovsky-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Antonovsky 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Antonovsky-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Antonovsky 1987</LINK>). Central to salutogenesis is a person&#8217;s sense of coherence, which Antonovsky defined as a global orientation that denotes the degree of self-esteem and confidence an individual possesses to enable them to deal with life&#8217;s vicissitudes. In essence salutogenesis involves fostering a positive outlook and sense of self-worth to empower the individual to realize their potential. Empowerment is a key element of woman-centred care and the drive to normalise birth - an international initiative, led in the UK by the Royal College of Midwives (<LINK REF="REF-RCM-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">RCM 2008</LINK>). The development of normal birth care pathways is consistent with these aims (<LINK REF="REF-NHS-Wales-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">NHS Wales 2004</LINK>). Another stimulus to normalise birth is the international concern over the rise in caesarean sections in particular, but the medicalisation of labour and birth in general (<LINK REF="REF-RCOG-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">RCOG 2001</LINK>). The medicalisation of childbirth has many women believing that childbirth is inherently dangerous (<LINK REF="REF-Green-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Green 2007</LINK>). It can be argued that water as an environment changes the context in which care is provided; it facilitates the paradigm shift, from professional-centred to woman-centred, from pathology dominated to normality expected. The woman is in her own 'world' and access to her is mediated by the water.</P>
<P>Water implies relaxation and warmth, and many would suggest it also conveys femininity and sexuality (<LINK REF="REF-Odent-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Odent 1999</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-Clarke-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clarke 2007</LINK> report an increase in the use of water immersion during labour and birth as one result of increasing the focus of one maternity unit to normality through the use of a care pathway. A birthing pool therefore offers midwives an opportunity to develop the skills required to provide woman-centred care, form a therapeutic rapport with women, facilitate their freedom and participation in decision making, and support them in having choice and control over their care (<LINK REF="REF-Nursing-and-Midwifery-Council-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nursing and Midwifery Council 2010</LINK>).</P>

</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2011-07-19 09:58:45 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Denise Atherton">
<P>To assess the effects of water immersion during labour and/or birth (labour stages one, two and three) on maternal, fetal, neonatal and caregiver wellbeing. For the purpose of this review wellbeing is defined as outcomes measuring physical and psychological health. This review addresses the benefits and risks of immersion in water versus no immersion during each stage of labour. In addition, the review compares early (cervical dilation less than 5 cm) with late (cervical dilation more than 5 cm) immersion, different pool designs, still versus moving water, and water with or without additives.</P>

For continuous outcomes we would use the test proposed by <LINK REF="REF-Egger-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Egger 1997</LINK>, and for dichotomous outcomes we would use the test proposed by <LINK REF="REF-Harbord-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harbord 2006</LINK>. If asymmetry was detected in any of these tests or was suggested by a visual assessment, we proposed to perform exploratory analyses to investigate it.</P>

<P>One-to-one care in labour is known to affect labour outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-Hodnett-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hodnett 2007</LINK>), and this was clearly documented in four trials (<LINK REF="STD-Cammu-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Cammu 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Da-Silva-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Da Silva 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nikodem-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Nikodem 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Taha-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Taha 2000</LINK>). Where it was stated that normal/routine/standard care was provided, this was understood to mean that the practitioners who normally provided intrapartum care to women in labour in the study centre provided care for the study participants (<LINK REF="STD-Da-Silva-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Da Silva 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Eckert-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Eckert 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Eriksson-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Eriksson 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nikodem-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Nikodem 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rush-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Rush 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schorn-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Schorn 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Woodward-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Woodward 2004</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Cammu-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Cammu 1994</LINK> indicated that care was supervised by obstetric staff.</P>

<P>The studies collected a wide range of data, but the specific outcome measures collected were very variable, and collected in different formats. For example, some studies did not consider neonatal wellbeing. Use of Apgar scores was also variable; some used them as continuous data, others as dichotomous, making comparison across studies challenging, and resulting in the reporting of many variables based on the results from one study.</P>

<P>We excluded the two studies by Cluett (<LINK REF="STD-Cluett-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Cluett 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cluett-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Cluett 2004</LINK>), primarily because all the women were nulliparous who had been diagnosed as having dystocia in the first stage of labour, and the comparison (control) group all received augmentation of labour. Hence comparison and inclusion in any meta-analysis with women at low risk of complications is inappropriate. In addition, <LINK REF="STD-Cluett-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Cluett 2001</LINK> was a feasibility study and only involved four women in each arm. <LINK REF="STD-Cluett-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Cluett 2004</LINK> suggested that in nulliparous women who have been classified as having slow progress in the first stage of labour, labouring in water reduced the incidents of epidural analgesia, although this did not reach statistical significance (P = 0.056). The pain scores were significantly lower, but as the comparison group received augmentation of labour, it could be argued that this was to be expected. This further supports the rationale for not including these women in this review, as doing so would not represent the situation when water immersion would be used, namely in a low-risk labour and birth.</P>
<P>One pilot study (<LINK REF="STD-Calvert-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Calvert 2000</LINK>) compared the use of essential oil of ginger with the use of essential oil of lemon grass.

<P>None of the trials cite any blinding of outcome assessment, and this is likely to be difficult to achieve, as use of water during labour is usually clearly documented in case records.</P>
<P>As an intervention, it is not possible to blind participants or carers to water immersion. Not all participants and/or carers will be in a state of equipoise between immersion or non-immersion, that is being equally comfortable and confident about water immersion. This may positively or negatively influence outcomes such as pain perception and hence subsequent analgesia use, maternal satisfaction, self-esteem and postpartum depression. An example of this is <LINK REF="STD-Woodward-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Woodward 2004</LINK>, which reports that some midwives were apparently not supportive of women using water, suggesting a positive bias within the women, and in this case a negative bias within the midwives. Conversely <LINK REF="STD-Rush-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Rush 1996</LINK> reports practitioners as maintaining a interest in low-intervention labour practice, suggesting a positive bias towards water immersion. Water immersion, however, is as much a psychological choice as a physical pain management strategy, and as such pragmatic clinical trials are assessing the effect of the whole package.</P>

Four (of 58) women in <LINK REF="STD-Da-Silva-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Da Silva 2006</LINK> did not receive the water intervention due to medical/obstetric reasons.

<P>The trials adopted a variety of definitions for water immersion, with different size baths/pools containing different volumes of water.

They did not use the McGill Pain Questionnaire.

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2011-08-26 13:15:58 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review showed that immersion in water during labour significantly reduced the epidural/spinal analgesia rate based on data from six trials. There was also a significant reduction in the duration of the first stage of labour in the immersion group (seven trials, immersion versus no immersion). However, there was a high level of heterogeneity for some of these outcomes and so these results should therefore be examined with caution. The only other statistically significant results were for experience of moderate to severe pain; wish to use water for a subsequent labour, and a reduction in blood pressure, all of which were measured in one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Taha-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Taha 2000</LINK>), during the first stage of labour.</P>
<P>These results are consistent with observational studies. However, these conclusions need to be considered in the context of small sample sizes (range 33 to 1237); only two trials achieved a total sample size of greater than 300; blinding to the intervention is not possible; and many outcomes were only considered in one or two trials. These factors limit the interpretation of the results. An equivalence study is required to explore whether or not labour and/or birth in water is as safe as labour/birth without immersion in water, in a comparable group of women. It is recognised, however, that as use of water in labour and birth is now widely considered a matter of maternal choice, it is increasingly unlikely that conducting a large, multicentred, randomised controlled trial needed to gain the required evidence will be feasible or acceptable. Large audits and cohort studies should be undertaken in units which provide a pool facility to provide evidence for practice (<LINK REF="REF-Geissbuehler-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Geissbuehler 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zanetti_x002d_Daellenbach-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zanetti-Daellenbach 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>The trials reported using different sized pools (only five trials provide information on bath/pool size: <LINK REF="STD-Cammu-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Cammu 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Da-Silva-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Da Silva 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Eckert-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Eckert 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Eriksson-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Eriksson 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kuusela-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Kuusela 1998</LINK>); various durations in the water; and still or moving water, each of which had an impact on the outcomes. These factors limit the validity of the findings.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Rush-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Rush 1996</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Woodward-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Woodward 2004</LINK> reported respectively that 46% (n = 183) and 40% (n = 16) of women allocated to water immersion did not actually use water, although in the case of <LINK REF="STD-Woodward-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Woodward 2004</LINK> this was expected and a recruitment ratio of 2:1 had been adopted. In both studies, analysis was by intention to treat, and they did not report outcomes by actual use. It is possible that subgroup analysis excluding women who did not use the water might have increased the difference between water users and non-users, in favour of less epidural analgesia for those who used water immersion. This would be consistent with the study by <LINK REF="STD-Chaichian-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Chaichian 2009</LINK>. This is pertinent, as the authors reported that the main reasons for non-use of the water included early request for epidural, identification of complication precluding water use, as well as non-availability of the pool and change of mind (numbers for each are provided by <LINK REF="STD-Woodward-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Woodward 2004</LINK> but not by <LINK REF="STD-Rush-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Rush 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>Another confounding factor is that the gestational age at which water immersion is permissible varies across the trials, from greater than 34 weeks' gestation (<LINK REF="STD-Eriksson-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Eriksson 1997</LINK>) through 35 weeks (<LINK REF="STD-Ohlsson-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Ohlsson 2001</LINK>) and 36 weeks (<LINK REF="STD-Schorn-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Schorn 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Taha-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Taha 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Woodward-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Woodward 2004</LINK>) to greater than 37 weeks (<LINK REF="STD-Cammu-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Cammu 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chaichian-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Chaichian 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Da-Silva-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Da Silva 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Eckert-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Eckert 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kuusela-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Kuusela 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rush-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Rush 1996</LINK>). This is due to variations in the definition of 'preterm' adopted by different countries. However the baseline characteristics of participants in the included studies showed no difference (<I>see</I> <LINK TAG="INTERVENTION_EFFECTS" TYPE="SECTION">Effects of interventions</LINK>, Neonatal outcomes for immersion during the first stage of labour).</P>
<P>Although all the trials involved women defined as 'in labour', this was interpreted differently, from trials including all women with contractions, or about to have labour induced with a cervical dilatation of as little as 1 cm (<LINK REF="STD-Eckert-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Eckert 2001</LINK>), to trials including only women in active labour with a cervical dilatation of greater than 6 cm (<LINK REF="STD-Da-Silva-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Da Silva 2006</LINK>). This variability makes comparisons across trials problematic.</P>
<P>Another variation is that the length of the first stage of labour for women in the trial by <LINK REF="STD-Cammu-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Cammu 1994</LINK> was shorter (mean of 244 minutes) and less variable (small standard deviation of 139 minutes), compared to a first stage length of 846 minutes (standard deviation 432 minutes) in the trial by <LINK REF="STD-Schorn-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Schorn 1993</LINK>. This suggests that the samples may have met different inclusion criteria or experienced a different management protocol during labour, although this was not explicit in the papers. The length of the second stage of labour for the women in the immersion group is much longer than might be expected in the trial by <LINK REF="STD-Schorn-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Schorn 1993</LINK>, which involved nulliparae only, compared to <LINK REF="STD-Kuusela-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Kuusela 1998</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Chaichian-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Chaichian 2009</LINK> where the second stage duration was reported as 21 and 20 minutes respectively. This may again relate to different management strategies, in particular definition of the onset of the second stage and the use or not of directed pushing, but again this is not detailed within the papers.</P>
<P>Only one trial investigated early (before a cervical dilatation of 5 cm) versus late (after a cervical dilatation of 5 cm) immersion in water during the first stage of labour, which investigated a higher rate of augmentation and use of pharmacological analgesia in the early immersion group (<LINK REF="STD-Eriksson-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Eriksson 1997</LINK>). The main issue arising from this trial is whether or not women in the trial were actually in active labour, and therefore could reasonably be expected to progress spontaneously. Alternatively women may have been in the latent phase, which might have been augmented by mobilisation and other activity within a labour room, compared to relaxation and latent phase contractions ceasing in the water group. It is not possible to preclude that some women may have entered a birthing pool in the latent phase of labour, which could predispose them requiring augmentation. The trial did not consider this possibility.</P>
<P>Although all participants across the included trials were considered at low risk of complications, and trials were excluded where this was not so (<LINK REF="STD-Cluett-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Cluett 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cluett-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Cluett 2004</LINK>), <LINK REF="STD-Eckert-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Eckert 2001</LINK> reported the inclusion of women whose labour was induced. <LINK REF="STD-Rush-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Rush 1996</LINK> indicated that 41 women who did not meet the inclusion criteria had been randomised. When these women were removed from the analysis the P value for epidural analgesia use changes to 0.044 from 0.069, whilst that for instrumental vaginal delivery changes to 0.011 from 0.055. Therefore, when ineligible women are excluded the results indicate that, for women at low risk of complications, labouring in water reduced the likelihood of epidural/narcotic use and of needing an instrumental vaginal delivery (<LINK REF="STD-Rush-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Rush 1996</LINK>). The definitions adopted for 'labour' were varied and may have influenced outcomes. In particular, <LINK REF="STD-Cammu-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Cammu 1994</LINK> required that the amniotic membranes were ruptured, although there is no indication as to whether this occurred spontaneously or artificially. In contrast the membranes were intact in all participants in the trial by <LINK REF="STD-Schorn-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Schorn 1993</LINK>. Participants in other trials had a mixture of intact and ruptured membranes (<LINK REF="STD-Ohlsson-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Ohlsson 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rush-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Rush 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Taha-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Taha 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Woodward-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Woodward 2004</LINK>). These differences may affect pain perception, and hence influence analgesia uptake, maternal satisfaction, and possibly labour progress, which makes comparison across trials difficult. There is little or no information about the presence of one-to-one care or not in the trials evaluating first stage of labour outcomes, although <LINK REF="STD-Rush-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Rush 1996</LINK> indicated that caregivers tended to be more continuously present with the water immersion participants. As one-to-one care in labour is known to affect outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-Hodnett-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hodnett 2007</LINK>), if this was not balanced across trial arms, this could account for any differences found.</P>
<P>The main conclusion of this review is that labouring in water significantly reduces the incidence of epidural/spinal. It is not possible to conclude whether the differences identified, in particular the reduction in epidural/spinal analgesia, are due to water alone, or the water/pool environment. Water immersion is a care package which includes the actual water and the associated environment, together with the interactions of the woman and her caregivers. It may be that this last factor, linking midwives/caregivers who support the tranquil, no-obstetric-intervention, salutogenic philosophy espoused by labour and birth in water with like-minded women is the most important component. This would be consistent with the evidence on one-to-one care in labour (<LINK REF="REF-Hodnett-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hodnett 2007</LINK>). It could be argued that, if water immersion facilitates the adoption of a woman-centred approach to care, facilitating normalisation of labour and birth, as many now seek (<LINK REF="REF-Maternity-Care-Working-Party-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maternity Care Working Party 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-RCM-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">RCM 2008</LINK>), then immersion in water should be promoted.</P>

<P>Despite limitations in the validity and reliability of the randomised controlled trial evidence to date due to trial design, the statistically significant reduction in rate of epidural/spinal/paracervical analgesia indicates that water immersion during the first stage of labour reduces the need for this invasive, pharmacological pain mode of analgesia, which disturbs the physiology of labour and is associated with iatrogenic interventions. We found no evidence that this was associated with poorer outcomes for neonates, longer labours or more complex births. The other significant findings come from data from one study only and therefore have to be read with caution. Women can be advised that the use of water immersion in the first stage of labour may reduce the incidence of epidural/spinal/paracervical analgesia, and midwives and other birth attendants can suggest water immersion as part of labour pain management strategy.</P>
<P>There is insufficient evidence about the use of water immersion during second stage of labour and therefore clear implications cannot be stated.</P>
<P>Overall, the evidence indicates that immersion in water during the first stage decreases maternal uptake of epidural/spinal analgesia, and that water immersion during the first stage of labour can be supported for women at low risk of complications.</P>
<P>Immersion during the second stage of labour needs further investigation, but at present there is no clear evidence to support or not to support a woman's decision to give birth in water.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2011-04-01 18:35:46 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is some evidence that immersion in water during the first stage of labour reduces the need for analgesia, but the limited reliability and validity of the studies means that this would benefit from further research, in particular from a study of an appropriate size to assess equivalence. There is a lack of clarity as to what constitutes water immersion, and further evaluation of the relative merits of different shaped/sized pools is required, and of still versus moving water, and the relative merits of water immersion during early labour (latent phase). There is insufficient information to support or not to support the use of immersion during the second stage of labour (birth), or the third stage. The safety regarding infection and neonatal outcomes are not addressed, and large collaborative trials are needed to answer these critical issues. It has been suggested that maternal satisfaction increases with water immersion, although there is a need for a large trial to evaluate this.</P>
<P>There are no data on caregiver outcomes and this warrants investigation.</P>

<P>The method does not meet the inclusion criteria for this review. It is impossible to disentangle the effects of immersion in water. The aim of the trial was to compare 3 non-pharmacological approaches to relieve back pain. A total of 34 women were randomly allocated to receive 1 of 3 treatments: (1) intracutaneous sterile water injections, (2) transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation and (3) standard care that included back massage, whirlpool bath and liberal mobilisation. The sample size is small and results should be interpreted within the setting only. Women in the ISW group experienced a decrease in the intensity and unpleasantness of their backache, but they would not like to use this method in a future labour.</P>

<FEEDBACK_SUMMARY>
<P>How can the review authors conclude "Overall, the evidence indicates that immersion in water decreases maternal reported pain levels and the uptake of pharmacological analgesia" when their analysis reports the odds ratio for pharmacological analgesia as 1.08 (95% CI 0.71 to 1.65)?</P>

<FEEDBACK_REPLY MODIFIED="2011-06-22 13:43:09 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Sonja L  Henderson">
<P>In the authors' conclusions section of the previous update of this review (Cluett 2002), the statement "immersion in water decreases maternal reported pain levels" was based on the one trial (Taha 2000) that reported this outcome (OR 0.23, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.63). The limitation of only one study is indicated in the maternal outcome section of the review. The reference to a decrease in maternal &#8216;uptake of pharmacological analgesia&#8217; was based on the outcome &#8216;use of epidural/spinal/paracervical block&#8217; (OR 0.84, 95% CI 0.71 to 0.99), which included data from four trials, not the outcome &#8216;any pharmacological analgesia&#8217; which include data from two trials and is the one cited by Wein above.  We accept the wording was ambiguous, and have clarified it in the current update.</P>
<P>Interestingly, in this update data for these outcomes have altered minimally: use of epidural/spinal/paracervical block is now OR 0.82, 95% CI 0.70 to 0.98, with data from six trials; &#8216;any pharmacological analgesia&#8217;, remains unchanged, as do the data for maternal pain experience. </P>
