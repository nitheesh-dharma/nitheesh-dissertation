<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2008-10-28 13:03:17 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Liliana Coco">
<P>Treatment of relapsing-remitting Multiple Sclerosis (RRMS) is currently based on immunomodulatory drugs such as recombinant interferon (IFN beta-1a and IFN beta-1b) or glatiramer acetate (GA) although these therapies have been shown to be only modestly effective. Recently it has been suggested that the nervous damage, supported by inflammation processes, is an early event in MS evolution which immunomodulatory drugs can only partially prevent. IFN and GA demonstrated only partial efficacy that could be ascribed to the fact that in the studies that lead to their approval they have been initiated in patients with a disease history of several years. The objective of this review was to assess IFN beta and GA efficacy in preventing the conversion to clinically defined multiple sclerosis in patients after the first demyelinating events. Among the pertinent literature, only three studies were found to test the efficacy of IFN beta including a total of 1160 participants (639 under treatment, 521 under placebo); while no published study testing the efficacy of GA was found. The review found that early interferon beta-1a treatment is effective in preventing the conversion of the first isolated demyelinating episodes into clinically definite MS both after one year and two years of follow-up. Side effects and adverse events occurrence was the same as reported by the many studies on IFN beta treatments in MS patients with different levels of the disease. More research is however needed to evaluate the long term preventing efficacy of these drugs and dosages.</P>

</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT MODIFIED="2008-08-29 11:45:27 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Deirdre Beecher">
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Immunomodulatory drugs have been shown to be only modestly effective in clinically definite relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS). It has been hypothesized that their efficacy could be higher if used at the first appearance of symptoms, that is in the clinically isolated syndromes (CIS) suggestive of demyelinating events, a pathology which carries a high risk to convert to clinically definite MS (CDMS).</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>The objective of this review was to assess the effects of immunomodulatory drugs compared to placebo in adults in preventing conversion from CIS to CDMS which means the prevention of a second attack.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2008-08-29 11:45:27 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Deirdre Beecher">
<P>We searched the Cochrane MS Group Trials Register (June 2007), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library Issue 3, 2007), MEDLINE (January 1966 to June 2007), EMBASE (January 1974 to June 2007) and reference lists of articles. We also contacted manufacturers and researchers in the field.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>The trials selected were double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised trials of CIS patients treated with immunomodulatory drugs.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Study selection have been independently done by two reviewers. Two further reviewers independently assessed trial quality and extracted and analysed data. Study authors were contacted for additional informations. Adverse effects information was collected from the trials.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Only three trials tested the efficacy of interferon (IFN) beta including a total of 1160 participants (639 treatment, 521 placebo); no trial tested the efficacy of glatiramer acetate (GA). The metanalyses showed that the proportion of patients converting to CDMS was significantly lower in IFN beta-treated than in placebo-treated patients both after one year (pooled OR 0.53; 95% CI, 0.40 to 0.71; p &lt;0.0001) as well as after two years of follow-up (pooled OR 0.52; 95% CI, 0.38 to 0.70; p &lt;0.0001). Early treatment with IFN beta was associated with the side effect profile reported by the randomised controlled trials with this drug. Since side effects were reported with some heterogeneity in the three studies the metanalysis was possible only for the frequency of serious adverse events, not significantly different in IFN beta-treated or placebo-treated patients.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>The efficacy of IFN beta treatment on preventing the conversion from CIS to CDMS was confirmed over two years of follow-up. Since patients had some clinical heterogeneity (length of follow-up, clinical findings of initial attack), it could be useful for the clinical practice to further analyse the efficacy of IFN beta treatment in different patient subgroups.</P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
</ABSTRACT>
<BODY MODIFIED="2008-09-18 13:10:19 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Deirdre Beecher">
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic, inflammatory, demyelinating disease of the central nervous system that most commonly affects women with an onset typically between 20 and 40 years of age. MS is the most common cause of neurological disability in young adults. A diagnosis of MS requires the occurrence of at least two neurological events consistent with demyelination that are separated both in space, i.e. corresponding to two different locations in the central nervous system (CNS), and in time [<LINK REF="REF-Mc-Donald-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mc Donald 2001</LINK>]. <BR/>Treatment of relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) is currently based on glatiramer acetate (GA) or recombinant IFN (IFN beta-1a and IFN beta-1b). <BR/>GA has been demonstrated to be more effective than placebo in reducing relapse rate, slowing 1.5 point Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) progression [<LINK REF="REF-Johnson-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnson 1995</LINK>], and reducing MRI signs of disease activity [<LINK REF="REF-Comi-2001A" TYPE="REFERENCE">Comi 2001A</LINK>]. Several meta-analyses [<LINK REF="REF-La-Mantia-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">La Mantia 2000</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Durelli-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Durelli 2002</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Munari-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Munari 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Martinelli-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Martinelli 2003</LINK>] of the published randomised controlled trials reported controversial results. When intention-to-treat principles were carefully applied [<LINK REF="REF-Durelli-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Durelli 2002</LINK>], risk ratio, absolute risk reduction, number needed to treat were not statistically significant. In addition the risk of having a relapse was reduced only during the first year of treatment [<LINK REF="REF-Munari-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Munari 2003</LINK>]. Recombinant IFN beta has been demonstrated to be effective in reducing relapse rate [<LINK REF="REF-The-IFNB-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">The IFNB 1993</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Jacobs-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jacobs 1996</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-PRISMS-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">PRISMS 1998</LINK>], disability progression [<LINK REF="REF-Jacobs-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jacobs 1996</LINK>], and the development of brain lesions at MRI [<LINK REF="REF-The-IFNB-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">The IFNB 1993</LINK>,<LINK REF="REF-Jacobs-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jacobs 1996</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-PRISMS-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">PRISMS 1998</LINK>]. A previous Cochrane review [<LINK REF="REF-Rice-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rice 2001</LINK>] concluded that IFN has a modest effect in patients with RRMS, in reducing exacerbations during the first two years of treatment . <BR/>It has been hypothesized that the partial efficacy of GA or IFN beta in RRMS can be ascribed to the fact that, in the studies which led to their approval, they have been used in patients with a disease history of several years. Recent pathological [<LINK REF="REF-Ferguson-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ferguson 1997</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Trapp-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Trapp 1998</LINK>] and MRI studies suggest that axonal damage, supported by inflammation processes, is an early event in MS evolution. It is not clear whether axonal injury is benefited by existent immunomodulating agents.<BR/>Epidemiological studies have shown that clinically isolated syndromes (CIS) suggestive of demyelinating events carry a high risk to convert to clinically definite MS (CDMS), particularly if the MRI scan has typical white matter lesions. Conversion to CDMS is defined as the occurrence of a second attack and clinical evidence of two separate lesions in CNS; or as with clinical evidence of one lesion and paraclinical evidence of another separate lesion [<LINK REF="REF-Poser-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Poser 1983</LINK>]. The two attacks must involve different parts of the CNS, must be separated by a period of at least one month, and must each last a minimum of 24 hours [<LINK REF="REF-Poser-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Poser 1983</LINK>]. Paraclinical evidence can be detected with MRI or visual evoked potentials [<LINK REF="REF-Mc-Donald-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mc Donald 2001</LINK>]. <BR/>There are two main rationales for the administration of GA or IFN beta in the early phases of MS: firstly to prevent axonal damage [<LINK REF="REF-Ferguson-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ferguson 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fu-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fu 1998</LINK>,<LINK REF="REF-Trapp-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Trapp 1998</LINK>], and, secondly, to prevent the conversion from CIS to CDMS. There is at present no evidence that GA or INFN- B can do either of them.<BR/>The purpose of this review was, therefore, to examine the published evidence for the efficacy of early treatment with GA or IFN beta to prevent the conversion from CIS to CDMS. </P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>The primary objective of this review was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of early treatment with GA or IFN beta on the proportion of CIS patients delayed to convert to MS.</P>
<P>Secondary objectives were to assess: <BR/>1. The time to second relapse and the annual relapse rate in those patients who developed CDMS. <BR/>2. The effect on surrogate markers of disease activity, such as MRI occurrence of new active lesions or changes of disease burden.</P>

</B>
</I>Titles and abstracts identified from the searches were independently checked by two reviewers. If it was clear that the study did not meet the eligibility criteria, it was excluded. If it was not clear from the abstract and title, the full text of study was obtained and evaluated independently by the reviewers. If no consensus was met about the possible inclusion/exclusion of any individual study, additional two reviewers independently assessed the full text of the studies to decide whether they fitted the inclusion criteria. A final decision was made by discussion among all the reviewers.<BR/>Reviewers were not masked to the name(s) of the author(s), institution(s) or publication source at any level of the review.</P>

<B>Quality assessment of trials<BR/>
</B>
</I>Two reviewers independently assessed the methodological quality of each trial. In particular the following factors were examined:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Adequate allocation concealment</LI>
<LI>Randomisation</LI>
<LI>Intention to treat analysis</LI>
<LI>Numbers lost to follow-up and withdrawn</LI>
<LI>Blinding of patient and physician who measured outcomes</LI>
<LI>Baseline comparison between treatment groups as regard to relevant clinical factors (time interval from the first clinical event to randomisation, baseline EDSS, age, gender</LI>
</UL>
<P>We assigned a quality rating for allocation concealment to each trial, using the criteria outlined in the Cochrane Reviewers' Handbook [<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2006</LINK>]: (A)adequate, (B) unclear, (C) inadequate, or (D) not used.<BR/>When that information was not reported, we submitted a formal request to the study authors or drug's company. If the investigators did not respond, the item was considered unclear.</P>
<P>
<I>
<B>Data extraction </B>
</I>
<BR/>It was performed independently by two reviewers. The methodological quality of the studies was assessed using a pre-agreed data extraction form. Particular attention was paid to: study design, description of randomisation, characteristics of the participants (age, gender, clinical findings of initial attack and EDSS score), inclusion/exclusion criteria, description of the study, outcome measures, length of follow-up, and number of patients withdrawn or dropping out of the trial. Reviewers compared results and differences of opinion by discussion. The trialists involved in the included trials, as well as the pharmaceutical companies sponsoring the trials, were asked to provide further details on study results where they seemed unclear from the article or still unpublished.</P>
<P>
<I>
<B>Data analysis </B>
</I>
<BR/>We analysed binary outcomes by calculating odds ratios (OR) for each trial with the uncertainty in each trial expressed using 95% confidence intervals (CI). We analysed continuous outcomes according to the difference between means. For each outcome a weighted treatment effect across trials was calculated using a fixed effect model. We expressed aggregated results as a weighted estimate of OR with the relative 95% CI for binary outcomes, and weighted difference between means across trials for continuous outcomes. Methodological heterogeneity was treated with sensitivity analysis. Pooling of time-to-event outcomes was calculated by computing hazard ratios for each trial and pooling them using the inverse variance method [<LINK REF="REF-Deeks-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deeks 2001</LINK>]. All these results were organised and processed by the Review Manager 4.2 (RevMan) developed by the Cochrane Collaboration.</P>

<P>We identified 553 articles. Fourteen studies possibly describing RCTs were selected. We excluded 9 articles after reading the full published papers: one study [<LINK REF="STD-Comi-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Comi 1995</LINK>] was the Early Treatment of Multiple Sclerosis, ETOMS study (<LINK REF="REF-Comi-2001A" TYPE="REFERENCE">Comi 2001A</LINK>) reporting study design with no data. Four studies were historical reviews [<LINK REF="STD-Labetouelle-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Labetouelle 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Galetta-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Galetta 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wermesch-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Wermesch 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Foroozan-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Foroozan 2002</LINK>]. Three studies analysed only MRI outcomes [<LINK REF="STD-Barkhof-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Barkhof 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_-Connor-2003" TYPE="STUDY">O' Connor 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Filippi-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Filippi 2004</LINK>] with no further information beyond those in the primary papers. The latter [<LINK REF="STD-Siddiqui-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Siddiqui 2005</LINK>] described an open label Controlled High-Risk Subjects Avonex Multiple Sclerosis Prevention Study, CHAMPS study [<LINK REF="STD-CHAMPS-2000" TYPE="STUDY">CHAMPS 2000</LINK>] extension trial.<BR/>In total we identified three trials relevant to this review [<LINK REF="STD-CHAMPS-2000" TYPE="STUDY">CHAMPS 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-ETOMS_x002c_-2001" TYPE="STUDY">ETOMS, 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-BENEFIT-2006" TYPE="STUDY">BENEFIT 2006</LINK>] and five papers referring to these trials. Three papers described the trials [<LINK REF="STD-CHAMPS-2000" TYPE="STUDY">CHAMPS 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-ETOMS_x002c_-2001" TYPE="STUDY">ETOMS, 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-BENEFIT-2006" TYPE="STUDY">BENEFIT 2006</LINK>]; the other two were CHAMPS subgroup analyses [CHAMPS STUDY GR 2001; Beck 2002] and they did not give additional information to the primary publication [<LINK REF="STD-CHAMPS-2000" TYPE="STUDY">CHAMPS 2000</LINK>]. A total of 1160 participants (639 treatment, 521 placebo) were randomised.</P>
<P>The agents compared to placebo were:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>IFN beta 1a 30 mcg weekly by intramuscular injection (CHAMPS trial)</LI>
<LI>IFN beta 1a 22 mcg weekly by subcutaneous injection (ETOMS trial)</LI>
<LI>IFN beta 1 b 250 mcg every other day by subcutaneous injection (BENEFIT trial)</LI>
</UL>
<P>The exclusion criteria were specified in all three trials. In the CHAMPS study, patients with a prior neurologic or visual event consistent with the occurrence of demyelination that lasted longer than 48 hours were excluded. In ETOMS study patients were excluded with any previous immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory treatment, or participation in any experimental procedure during the year before the study, or other serious intercurrent systemic illnesses or psychiatric disorders, pregnancy and unwillingness to use reliable methods of contraception. In BENEFIT study patients were excluded in whom any disease other than MS could explain their signs and symptoms. Also excluded were those with any previous episode that could possibly be attributed to an acute demyelinating event, or with complete transverse myelitis or bilateral optic neuritis, and those who had received prior immunosuppressive therapy.</P>
<P>The CHAMPS study included patients aged 18-50 years who had a first isolated neurological event consistent with demyelination and involving the optic nerve (unilateral optic neuritis), spinal cord (incomplete transverse myelitis), or brainstem or cerebellum (brainstem or cerebellar syndrome) that was confirmed on ophthalmologic or neurologic examination. Patients also had to have two or more clinically silent lesions of the brain that were at least 3 mm in diameter on MRI scans and were characteristic of MS (at least one lesion had to be periventricular or ovoid). The onset of the visual or neurologic symptoms had to have been no more than 14 days before intravenous corticosteroid therapy and no more than 27 days before randomisation. All patients received gr of methylprednisolone per day intravenously per 3 days followed by a 15 day oral tapering.</P>
<P>The ETOMS study included patients aged 18-40 years who had in the previous 3 months a first neurological episode indicating unifocal or multifocal involvement of the central nervous system suggestive of MS. Patients had to have a positive MRI scan (i.e., the presence of at least 4 white matter lesions on the T2 weighted scans; or at least 3 if at least 1 infratentorial or enhancing after injection of Gadolinium). Steroid treatment was allowed only for moderate or severe exacerbations (i.e. with the score of 3 or more in at least 1 Kurtzke (Kurtzke 1993) functional system or a score of 2 in at least 3 functional systems).</P>
<P>The BENEFIT study included patients with a CIS, defined as a first neurologic event suggestive of MS lasting for at least 24 hours and with symptoms and signs indicating either a single lesion (monofocal) or more than one lesion (multifocal) within the CNS. They had to be between 18 and 45 years of age, have presented with a first neurologic event suggestive of MS that lasted at least 24 hours, and had to have at least two clinically silent lesions on their PD/T2-weighted brain MRI scan with a size of at least 3 mm, at least one of which being ovoid, periventricular, or infratentorial.</P>
<P>The planned follow-up period varied from two (ETOMS trial, BENEFIT trial) to three years (CHAMPS trial).</P>
</STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<STUDY_QUALITY MODIFIED="2008-09-15 12:37:30 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Liliana Coco">
<P>Methodological quality was evaluated as adherence to the CONSORT statement [<LINK REF="REF-Altman-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Altman 2001</LINK>].</P>
<P>PARTICIPANTS<BR/>Eligibility criteria were confirmed by a neurologist or ophthalmologist of each individual peripheral centre in the CHAMPS. In the ETOMS study eligibility criteria were centrally confirmed by two members of the steering committee (with the supervision of the coordinating centre in case of disagreement). In the BENEFIT study the eligibility of each patient was centrally confirmed by an official eligibility review committee.</P>
<P>SAMPLE SIZE and EXPLANATION of INTERIM ANALYSIS and STOPPING RULES<BR/>Treatment period was planned to be 3 years in the CHAMPS, 2 years in the ETOMS and the BENEFIT. In the CHAMPS sample size was calculated on the basis of estimated 3-year rate of conversion to CDMS; in the ETOMS and in the BENEFIT on the basis of the estimated conversion over 2 years. In all the three trials it was declared that analyses included all randomised patients according to ITT principles. In all the three studies patients were censored on the last follow-up. No formal stopping rules were decided. No statistical methods to adjust for multiple analyses are described in both trials. The CHAMPS trial was terminated on the basis of the recommendation of the data and safety monitoring committee before all patients ended at least two years of follow-up.</P>
<P>RANDOMISATION<BR/>All the three trials were defined by the authors as randomised controlled trials. In the CHAMPS the method of random number generation and of allocation concealment are not described. The randomisation has been performed on the basis of a minimization procedure in order to achieve balance with respect to both the patients' number of each treatment group as well as T2-weighted lesion number (two, three or four, five to seven,and eight or more) and the type of initial clinical event (optic neuritis, spinal cord syndrome, or brain stem or cerebellar syndrome). In the ETOMS the treatment was assigned according to a computer-generated randomisation list stratified by centre pooled by country. Procedures to provide an adequate allocation concealment are not specified. In the BENEFIT study the randomisation was performed on the basis of a minimization procedure with an element of change applied to minimize imbalance of treatment groups for (selected) factors with potential impact on the risk of developing definite MS: 1) steroid use during the first clinical event, 2) investigators's classification of the first event as mono-or polysimptomatic (symptoms indicative of a single lesion, or more than one lesion), 3) number of T2 lesions on the screening MRI, and 4) CSF result. The BENEFIT study provided an adequate allocation concealment by providing study medication identical in appearance, packaging and labeling. Patients were instructed to cover injection sites during the examination by the masked evaluating neurologist.</P>
<P>BLINDING<BR/>All the three studies were defined as double-blinded by the authors. In the CHAMPS and the BENEFIT trials the blindness of treating and examining physicians has been declared; in the ETOMS two members of the steering committee reviewed the documentation of all exacerbations and assigned the primary outcome but it is unclear if they were blind to patient's treatment.<BR/>In the CHAMPS and the ETOMS studies no information about patients' blindness were provided; in the BENEFIT study patients' blindness was clearly declared. In the CHAMPS and the ETOMS trials no questionnaires to assess patients' or investigators' blindness were used. In the BENEFIT trial the effectiveness of blinding was investigated using a blinding questionnaire.</P>
<P>PARTICIPANT FLOW<BR/>A flow-chart of participants through each study stage is not provided in the CHAMPS while it is provided in the ETOMS and the BENEFIT.<BR/>The number of participants withdrawn or lost to follow up are shown in Table 01(<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>). In one study (ETOMS) one patient did not receive study medication and was not included in outcome analyses. In overall, 306 patients (27%) considering the pre-planned study durations were excluded after randomisation or were censored before the end of the studies. In the CHAMPS 83 (43%) of the 193 randomised participants in the treatment group and 66 (35%) of the 190 in the control group did not complete even two of the scheduled three years of follow-up because the study ended prematurely. Withdrawals were 30 (16%) in the treatment group and 27(14%) in the placebo group of the CHAMPS; four (3%) in the treatment group and three (2%) in the placebo group of the ETOMS; 65 (22%) in the treatment group and 28 (10%) in the placebo group of the BENEFIT.<B>
<BR/>
</B>
</P>
<P>PATIENTS' BASELINE CHARACTERISTICS<BR/>In all the three trials the randomised groups were similar in terms of demographic, clinical, and MRI baseline characteristics. In the CHAMPS trial age, gender, race, type of initial event, symptom duration before corticosteroid treatment initiation, number and volume of MRI lesions are reported in detail. In the ETOMS trial age, gender, Kurtzke expanded disability status scale (EDSS) and Scripps neurological rating scale (SNRS) scores, type of initial event, number of first attacks treated with steroids, number and volume of MRI lesions are reported in detail. In the BENEFIT trial age, gender, race, type of initial event, EDSS score, CSF characteristics, number and volume of MRI lesions are reported in detail.</P>
<P>OUTCOME EVALUATION<BR/>In the CHAMPS and the BENEFIT<B> </B>trials the primary outcome was the development of CDMS defined as the occurrence of either a new exacerbation or a progressive neurologic deterioration. In the ETOMS the primary outcome was the conversion to CDMS as defined by the occurrence of a new exacerbation. The exacerbation was defined following Poser et al. [<LINK REF="REF-Poser-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Poser 1983</LINK>] criteria in all trials. In the CHAMPS progressive neurological deterioration was differently defined for patients whose condition was neurologically stable or improving than for those who were still worsening one month after starting treatment. In the former patients it was defined as an increase of at least 1.5 points in EDSS (Kurtzke 1993) score at 6 months; in the latter the primary outcome was considered to be reached if at two months either further worsening was documented or the patient withdrew from the study. In the BENEFIT study progression was defined as (sustained progression) an increase by &gt;= 1.5 points on the EDSS reaching a total EDSS score of &gt; = 2.5 and confirmed at a consecutive visit three months later.</P>
<P>In all the trials outcomes were confirmed by a central committee and informations about its blindness were given only in CHAMPS.</P>
<P>ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING<BR/>Adverse events were reported in all the three trials.</P>

<U>PRIMARY OUTCOMES</U>
</P>
<P>(1) PROPORTION OF PATIENTS WHO CONVERTED TO CDMS</P>
<P>Since the three studies had different outcomes (occurrence of a second clinical episode or of increased disability score in the CHAMPS and in the BENEFIT; occurrence of a second clinical episode in the ETOMS), at first they have been analysed separately. Since in the CHAMPS trial not all the enrolled patients had the two year follow-up, the analyses have been conducted only at one year for the CHAMPS, at one and two years for the ETOMS and the BENEFIT.<B>
<BR/>
</B>
<BR/>
<I>"Per Protocol" Analysis (all dropouts and withdrawals considered with the result they had at the time they left the study for the time they remained in the study)<BR/>
</I>
<BR/>In the CHAMPS trial at one year the risk of conversion was 16% in participants receiving IFN and 24% in those receiving placebo. The OR with IFN administration was 0.59, 95% CI 0.34 to 1.01, p=0.05. The risk difference (RD) was -8%, 95%CI -17% to -0% , p= 0.05 which means that the conversion to CDMS would be prevented in 8 (95 % CI 0 to 17) of 100 CIS patients during the first year of IFN treatment.</P>
<P>In the ETOMS trial at one year the risk of conversion was 25% in participants receiving IFN and 37% in those receiving placebo. The OR with IFN administration was 0.57, 95% CI 0.35 to 0.94, p=0.03 and the RD -12%, 95%CI -22% to -2% , p= 0.02. At two years the risk of conversion in participants receiving IFN was 34.6% and 46% in those receiving placebo. The OR with IFN administration was 0.62, 95% CI 0.39 - 0.99, p=0.05.</P>
<P>In the BENEFIT trial at one year the risk of conversion was 18% in participants receiving IFN and 31% in those receiving placebo. The OR with IFN administration was 0.48, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.74, p=0.0009 and the RD -13%, 95% CI -22% to -5% , p = 0.001. At two years the risk of conversion in participants receiving IFN was 26% and 44% in those receiving placebo. The OR with IFN administration was 0.44, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.66, p&lt;0.0001; the RD -18%, 95% CI -27% to -9% , p&lt;0.0001.<BR/>
<U>
<BR/>
</U>The metanalysis at one year has been done taking off the five patients<B> </B>of the CHAMPS study whose conversion was due to disease progression. The CHAMPS data could be included only in the metanalysis at one year because not all the enrolled patients (83 in the IFN beta-1a group, 66 in the placebo group, corresponding to almost 40% of total) of CHAMPS study completed two years of follow-up.</P>
<P>
<I>CHAMPS-ETOMS-BENEFIT metanalysis at one year<BR/>
</I>Information about the proportion of patients who converted to CDMS was available from all trials including 691 patients.<BR/>Since in the CHAMPS paper patients who withdrew from study are detailed at each trimester we could calculate the total number of withdrawals per year; in the ETOMS the time of withdrawals was not specified and we considered them as occurred during the first year of follow up, because of the majority of the patients withdrew of the study after conversion to CDMS that occurred more frequently during the first year as showed in the Kaplan-Meier survival curve of probability of no conversion to CDMS over 2 years in the original paper.<BR/>In "per protocol" analysis the risk of conversion in patients receiving IFN was 19% and 30% in those receiving placebo. There was no significant heterogeneity between the trials (chi square = 0.44 , df=2, p=0.80). Using a fixed effects model, the pooled OR with IFN administration was 0.53, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.71, p&lt;0.0001. The pooled RD was -11%, 95% CI -16% to -6% which means that the conversion to CDMS would be delayed for 12 months in 11 (95 % CI 6 to 16) of 100 CIS patients during the first year of IFN treatment.<B> </B>In the "worst case scenario" analysis the risk of conversion was 25% in IFN and 29% in placebo-treated patients. The difference was not significant. In the "likely scenario" analysis, the risk of conversion was 25% in IFN and 33.5% in placebo-treated patients.<BR/>There was no significant heterogeneity between the trials (chi square= 0.99, df=2, p=0.61). Using a fixed effects model, the pooled OR with IFN administration was 0.65, 95% CI 0.50 to 0.84, p=0.001; the pooled RD was -9%, 95%CI -14% to -3%.In the "best case scenario" analysis the risk of conversion was 18% in IFN and 32% in placebo-treated patients. There was no significant heterogeneity between the trials (chi 2= 1.47, df=2, p=0.48). Using a fixed effects model, the pooled OR with IFN administration was 0.43, 95% CI 0.33 to 0.56, p&lt;0.0001; the pooled RD was -16%, 95% CI -21% to -11%.<BR/>

<BR/>
</B>(2) PROPORTION OF PATIENTS WITH SIDE EFFECTS OR ADVERSE EVENTS.</P>
<P>Side effects or adverse events were reported in all the three trials but they were not reported in a uniform manner.

<P>
<I>Serious adverse events<BR/>
</I>In the CHAMPS study they stated that all the observed serious adverse events were not attributed to treatment (they occurred in 12 patients, 6%, of the IFN beta and in 19, 10% of the placebo group); in the ETOMS study they did not specify if they were attributed to treatment and reported serious adverse event in 6 patients, 4%, of the IFN beta and in 5, 3% of the placebo group; in the BENEFIT study they stated that serious adverse events were reported in equal proportions (7%) of patients in the two treatments groups.<BR/>The metanalysis on 639 IFN beta-treated and 520 placebo-treated patients did not show any statistically significant difference between the two groups.</P>
<P>
<I>Adverse event reported at least in two of the three trials<BR/>
</I>
<BR/>a) <U>Flu-like syndrome or Flu-like symptoms<BR/>
</U>This side effect is reported only as a composite flu-like syndrome by CHAMPS: 104 patients (54%) in the IFN beta and 49 patients (26%) in the placebo group (p&lt;0.00001). In the ETOMS flu like syndrome is detailed in its component symptoms: fever,43 patients (28%) in the IFN beta and 18 (12%) in the placebo group (p=0.0005); myalgia, 26 patients (17%) in the IFN beta and 14 (9%) in the placebo group (p=0.04); chills, 17 patients (11%) in the IFN beta and 8 (5%) in the placebo group (p=0.07).<BR/>In the BENEFIT flu-like syndrome and fever are presented as two different adverse events: 129 (44%) in the IFN beta and 32 (18%) patients in the placebo group presented flu-like syndrome (p&lt;0.00001); 38 (13%) in the IFN beta group and 8 (4.5%) patients in the placebo group had fever (p=0.0008).<BR/>b) <U>Depression<BR/>
</U>This symptom is reported by CHAMPS: 39 patients (20%) of the IFN beta and in 25 (13%) of the placebo group (p=0.07); and BENEFIT: 30 patients (10.3%) of the IFN beta and 20 (11.4%) of the placebo group (p=0.71) .<BR/>c) <U>Injection-site reactions<BR/>

</P>
<P>a) <U>Time to conversion to CDMS</U>
<BR/>The time to conversion to CDMS is reported only by ETOMS: 569 days in the IFN beta and 252 days in the placebo group ( Hazard Ratio 0.65 95%CI, 0.45.94, p= 0.023) and BENEFIT: 618 days in the IFN beta and 255 in the placebo group (Hazard Ratio 0.50 95%CI0.36-0.70, p&lt;0.0001).<B>

<BR/>b) <U>The distribution of number of new relapses (0, 1, 2, &gt;2) in the treatment groups during each year of follow-up<BR/>
</U>This outcome is not reported by any of the three trials.</P>
<P>c) <U>The annualised relapse rate for each year and for the whole follow up </U>
<BR/>The annualised relapse rate was reported only by the ETOMS trial and was 0.33 in the IFN beta and 0.43 in the placebo group (p=0.045). This rate has been calculated fitting a poisson regression model including treatment as a covariate. This analysis can not be considered an ITT analysis.<BR/>Since the article did not provide the standard deviation, we could not calculate the weighted mean difference (WMD) for this outcome.</P>
<P>d) <U>The proportion of CIS patients who developed MRI activity </U>
<BR/>The occurrence of MRI activity was differently defined in the three studies: number of patients with new or enlarging PD/T2 lesions in the CHAMPS; number of patients with new or enlarging PD/T2 or Gad enhancing lesions in the ETOMS; cumulative number of new or enlarging PD/T2 or Gad enhancing lesions in the BENEFIT. In addition the analysis was possible only at one year for the CHAMPS due to the already explained reasons; only at two years for the ETOMS and the BENEFIT because the papers do not report the MRI activity data stratified per year. In all studies the difference in the occurrence of MRI activity was lower in IFN- compared to placebo-treated patients (CHAMPS, OR 0.35, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.59 ; p&lt; 0.0001; ETOMS, OR 0.34, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.79 ; p&lt; 0.01; BENEFIT, WMD -4.80, 95% CI -7.06 to -2.54, p&lt;0.0001 ).</P>
<P>e) <U>Change of disease burden<BR/>
</U>The change of disease burden was reported as median change in volume of PD/T2 whole brain lesion without the standard deviation. In all three studies the increase of total brain lesion volume was lower in patients who received IFN compared to those who received placebo (CHAMPS, p= 0.004; ETOMS, p= 0.002; BENEFIT, p&lt;0.05).</P>
</INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>The outcomes in these studies focus on second clinical or MRI attacks. The studies are much too short to give indication that there has been any impact on unremitting disability. Conversion to CDMS reflects the nature of the operational definition of MS diagnosis, since it is already known that interferon prevents relapse.<BR/>Recombinant IFN beta and GA are the approved immunomodulatory treatments for RRMS. Only IFN beta has been tested so far as treatment for a first demyelinating episode suggestive of MS. <BR/>Three multicenter randomised controlled trials tested IFN beta. Patients available for analyses were 1115 at 1 year (614 treatment and 501 placebo), and 1000 at 2 years (551 treatment and 449 placebo ). The three had a similar sample size (ranging from 308 to 468 patients) and this increases the uniformity of the evaluated data. In two trials (CHAMPS and ETOMS) we could not be sure that allocation was well concealed, because the centralization of treatment assignment was not reported, differently from the BENEFIT trial.<BR/>In all trials randomisation procedures had some restrictions. In CHAMPS and BENEFIT a minimization procedure was used in order to ensure the balance with respect to selected factors such as the number of baseline MRI lesions, the type of initial clinical event, steroid use during the fist clinical event, CSF results. Minimization restricts the randomisation because in this procedure only the first patient is truly randomly allocated; the allocation of each further patients is determinate by the allocation of the preceding patients. In ETOMS randomisation was stratified by center.<BR/>About blinding only in CHAMPS and BENEFIT trials the blindness of treating and examining physicians has been declared; in the ETOMS two members of the steering committee reviewed the documentation of all exacerbations and assigned the primary outcome but it is unclear if they were blind to patient's treatment. Both patients as well as investigators were tested about blindness by blinding questionnaire only in BENEFIT study. No informations were provided in the other two trials. Since in the CHAMPS trial not all the enrolled patients had the two year follow up, per protocol analyses have been conducted at one year for CHAMPS and at one and two years for ETOMS and BENEFIT trials. The "conversion to CDMS " was significantly delayed in the CHAMPS at one year and in the ETOMS and the BENEFIT both at one and two years. Marginal significancy in CHAMPS trial was due to the fact that the study had been planned to last 3 years but has been stopped earlier and a consistent number of patients did not reach the two year follow up. For the same reason all the three trials could be merged in a metanalysis at one year, while at two years only the data from the ETOMS and the BENEFIT trials could be merged. The metanalysis at one year showed that the proportion of patients converting to CDMS was significantly lower in IFN beta treated than in placebo treated patients ) but not in the worst scenario. The metanalysis at two years confirmed the efficacy of IFN beta in all scenarios. <BR/>Although these studies seem similar, there were marketed differences in outcome frequency once the effect of therapy did not withstand cross study comparison. For example the Benefit treatment arm is similar to the CHAMPS placebo arm, the BENEFIT placebo arm is similar to ETOMS placebo arm and the ETOMS treatment arm is similar to the CHAMPS placebo arm. <BR/>About the other primary outcome, evaluation of the prevalence and severity of the side effects and adverse events, they were reported with some heterogeneity in the three studies.<BR/>The flu-like symptoms are reported only as a composite syndrome by the CHAMPS, while they are detailed as flu-like symptoms, fever, myalgia, and chills in the ETOMS and the BENEFIT. Depression is reported only by the CHAMPS and the BENEFIT, injection site reactions only by the ETOMS and the BENEFIT. The frequency of the individual side effect was significantly higher in IFN than in placebo-treated patients in all cases with the exception of depression and chills. All studies did not specify the severity of individual side effects, but reported the occurrence of severe adverse events (SAD). The metanalysis showed that SAD frequency over two years was not significantly higher in the IFN beta-treated than in placebo-treated patients.<B>
<BR/>
</B>Among the secondary outcomes the distribution of number of relapses was not reported by all the three trials; the time to conversion to CDMS was reported by the ETOMS and the BENEFIT, and it resulted significantly increased in IFN-treated patients in both trials; the annualised relapse rate was reported only by the ETOMS, and since the ETOMS paper did not provide the standard deviation about this outcome, we could not calculated the weighted mean difference. In addition, the analysis of relapse rate in this trial was done with a poisson regression model which included the treatment as a covariate. This is not a pure ITT analysis and the results might have been affected by the used model. The occurrence of MRI activity was reported by all trials, and resulted significantly reduced in IFN-treated patient. The change of the disease burden was also significantly lower in IFN-treated patients in all trials. </P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>Our study showed that early IFN beta treatment delays a second attack over 2 years of follow-up in the two trials where the analysis was possible.<BR/>Some limitations in the interpretation of the results are implied by the analysis of the quality of the studies: in the ETOMS trial no clear information about the blindness of the treating and evaluating investigators is provided; the number of patients lost to follow-up during the second year of the CHAMPS study is quite high (around 40%) due to the early trial termination. <BR/>Early treatment with IFN beta was associated with the usual side effect profile reported by the many randomised controlled trials with this drug. Informations about side effects and adverse events was provided for a follow-up period of two years in 90% of the patients of the ETOMS and the BENEFIT trials and in 34% patients of the CHAMPS trial. A longer follow-up might be useful for a more thorough evaluation of side effects and adverse events occurrence.<BR/>A very important issue for the practicing neurologist is to establish the meaning of efficacy of IFN beta on the risk of conversion, in order to establish better defined indications for CIS treatment and to be strongly supported in recommending or not treatment in this initial phase of disease. This issue requires further data not published but possibly available from the drug manufacturers and trial investigators.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Our analysis was limited by two facts. Only three trials have been published on early CIS immunomodulatory treatment and the information available for one [<LINK REF="STD-CHAMPS-2000" TYPE="STUDY">CHAMPS 2000</LINK>] of these were limited to only one year of follow up. Several outstanding issues relating to early CIS immunomodulatory treatment are awaiting for a clear answer:<BR/>(1) What is the optimal dose and type of IFN beta for preventing conversion from CIS to CDMS?<BR/>(2) Do the different types of CIS presentation have a different sensitivity to immunomodulatory treatment? To identify different responses to early therapy on the basis of different type of presentation would allow to identify which are patients with a better response to treatment and consequently clinicians would be driven by these informations in their practice. <BR/>(3) Other immunomodulatory drugs should be tested.<BR/>More randomised controlled trial with a complete and longer follow up are needed.</P>

<P>Intention to treat: mentioned</P>
<P>Double blind: however, the occurrence of side effect, mainly injection site reaction, raises doubts about blindness of patients.</P>
<P>Treatment: 3 years</P>
<P>Follow up: Due to the premature study termination 83 patients of the IFN beta 1a and 66 of the placebo group had a follow up short than 24 months.<BR/>Withdrawal criteria: not mentioned</P>

<P>Primary outcome: development of CDMS. For patients whose condition was neurologically stable or improving one month after the initiation of treatment with the study drug, the endpoint was defined as the occurrence of either a new visual or neurologic event or progressive neurologic deterioration. A patient whose initial demyelinating event was clinically worse one month after the initiation of treatment was considered to have reached the primary endpoint if either further worsening was documented at two months or the patient wihdrew from the study before completing two months of treatment.</P>
<P>The outcome was confirmed by a central committee whose members were unware of the patients' treatment assignments.</P>
<P>Other clinical outcomes: none.</P>
<P>MRI outcomes: number of new or enlarging lesions and volume of lesions on T2 weighted MRI scans and the number of Gad-enhancing lesion on T1-weighted MRI scans were assessed according to a standardized method.</P>
