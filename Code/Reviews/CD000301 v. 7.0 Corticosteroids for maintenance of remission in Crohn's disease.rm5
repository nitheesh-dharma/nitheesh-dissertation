<SUMMARY>
<TITLE>Corticosteroids for maintenance of remission in Crohn's disease</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>The use of corticosteroids among patients with non-active Crohn's disease does not appear to be effective in reducing the risk of disease recurrence over a 24 month period. Side effects associated with the long term use of corticosteroids include osteoporosis and cataracts. There may be subgroups of patients who would benefit from low dose corticosteroids but the long-term effectiveness of this type of treatment has not been studied. </P>
</SUMMARY_BODY>
</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>The efficacy of corticosteroids in the setting of maintenance therapy for Crohn's disease has never been clearly demonstrated. It would be important to determine, based upon the currently available data from controlled trials, if the use of chronic corticosteroid therapy is of benefit in patients with quiescent Crohn's disease or if there is an identifiable subgroup of Crohn's disease patients, such as those in whom therapy cannot be successfully tapered, who might benefit from such treatment.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of conventional systemic corticosteroid therapy in maintaining clinical remission in Crohn's disease.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>A computer-assisted search of the on-line bibliographic database MEDLINE of studies published in English, French, Spanish, Italian and German between 1966 and July, 2008. Manual searches of the reference lists from the potentially relevant studies were performed in order to identify additional studies that may have been missed using the computer-assisted search strategy. Proceedings from major gastrointestinal meetings were also manually searched from 1985 to 2003 in order to identify unpublished studies. The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Review Group Specialized Trials Register were also searched.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trials involving patients of any age with Crohn's disease in clinical remission as defined by a CDAI &lt; 150 or by the presence of no symptoms or only mild symptoms at the time of entry into the trial. The experimental treatment consisted of oral conventional corticosteroid therapy (excluding budesonide, fluticasone, etc). Clinical disease relapse was used as the outcome measure of interest.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Eligible studies were selected by 4 reviewers and data were extracted onto standardized data extraction forms. Disagreements in eligibility or data extraction were resolved by consensus. Data were converted into individual 2x2 tables for each study. The presence of significant heterogeneity among studies was tested using the chi-square test. The 2x2 tables were synthesized into a summary test statistic using the pooled odds ratio and 95% confidence intervals as described by Cochran and Mantel and Haenszel (the 'odds ratio' in MetaView). A fixed effects model was used for the pooling of data.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Four studies were initially judged as being eligible for inclusion. After obtaining additional information on one of the studies it was excluded because it was not double-blind. The total number of subjects included in the analysis at the time points of 6, 12 and 24 months were 142, 131 and 95 for the corticosteroid group and 161, 138 and 87 for the control group. The odds ratios for relapse on active treatment and the corresponding 95% confidence intervals were 0.71 (0.39, 1.31), 0.82 (0.47, 1.43) and 0.72 (0.38, 1.35) at 6, 12 and 24 months respectively. </P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>The use of conventional systemic corticosteroids in patients with clinically quiescent Crohn's disease does not appear to reduce the risk of relapse over a 24 month period of follow-up. An updated literature search performed in July 2008 did not identify any new trials.</P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>

<BODY MODIFIED="2008-07-14 13:54:45 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="John K MacDonald">
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Corticosteroids appear to be the most effective class of drugs for the treatment of acute flares of Crohn's disease (<LINK REF="STD-NCCDS-1979" TYPE="STUDY">NCCDS 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-ECCDS-1984" TYPE="STUDY">ECCDS 1984</LINK>). However, their efficacy in the setting of maintenance therapy has never been clearly demonstrated. A number of randomized controlled trials were unable to show any benefit of chronic low to moderate dose corticosteroid therapy (<LINK REF="STD-Smith-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-NCCDS-1979" TYPE="STUDY">NCCDS 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-ECCDS-1984" TYPE="STUDY">ECCDS 1984</LINK>). However, those studies included a very heterogeneous group of patients including patients who were in stable remission on no medication, patients who recently had entered remission on medical therapy and patients who had recently had surgical resection of involved bowel. Careful examination of the data from these trials suggests that there may be subgroups of patients who may benefit from chronic corticosteroid therapy (<LINK REF="STD-ECCDS-1984" TYPE="STUDY">ECCDS 1984</LINK>). In the European Co-operative Crohn's Disease Study patients who entered into the study with active disease and were randomized to corticosteroid therapy fared better over a 2 year period than patients randomized to placebo. </P>
<P>Despite the negative trials and the concern regarding potential long term toxicity many practitioners continue to use chronic corticosteroid therapy in patients who are unable to discontinue the medication without recurrence of disease activity. This steroid dependent group may make up 30 to 40% of all patients treated with corticosteroids (<LINK REF="REF-Munkholm-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Munkholm 1994</LINK>). However, this group may differ fundamentally from patients who are in stable remission on no medication. It would be important to determine, based upon the currently available data from controlled trials, if the use of chronic corticosteroid therapy is of benefit in patients with quiescent Crohn's disease or if there is an identifiable subgroup of Crohn's disease patients, such as those in whom therapy cannot be successfully tapered, who might benefit from such treatment.</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>To evaluate the effectiveness of conventional systemic (i.e. oral) corticosteroid therapy in maintaining clinical remission in Crohn's disease. A secondary endpoint was to evaluate the potential long term toxicity of corticosteroid therapy.</P>

</CRIT_OUTCOMES>
</SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<SEARCH_METHODS>
<P>A computer-assisted search of the on-line bibliographic database MEDLINE was carried out so as to identify potentially relevant studies published between 1966 and July, 2008. The Medical Subject Heading (MeSH) terms "Crohn disease" or "Inflammatory Bowel Disease" and "Glucocorticoid" (exploded) or "Glucocorticoid, synthetic" (exploded) were used to perform key word searches of the database. Citations were limited to those in English, French, Spanish, Italian and German. Manual searches of the reference lists from the potentially relevant studies were performed in order to identify additional studies that may have been missed using the computer-assisted search strategy. Proceedings from major gastrointestinal meetings (American Gastroenterology Association, British Society of Gastroenterology) were also manually searched from 1985 to 2008 in order to identify unpublished studies. Additionally, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and the IBD/FBD Review Group Specialized Trials Register were searched.</P>
</SEARCH_METHODS>
<DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Study selection</P>
<P>Potentially relevant studies were reviewed in an independent unblinded fashion by four authors (AMG, KE, OOT, RM), to determine if they met the criteria specified above. Reviewers rated each study as being eligible, ineligible or as having insufficient information to make a decision. Any disagreement among reviewers was resolved by consensus. Trials published in abstract form only were not included unless full details of the protocol and results could be obtained from the authors.</P>
<P>Data collection</P>
<P>Eligible studies were reviewed in duplicate and the results were extracted onto specially designed data extraction forms. The proportion of patients suffering clinical relapse in the active treatment and control groups of each study was derived from life tables, survival curves, or where possible, by calculating life tables from the data provided. </P>
<P>There were insufficient data available in the manuscripts to assess adverse events, withdrawal from the study (due to toxicity or adverse events), and drug interactions. There were also insufficient data to perform subgroup analysis such as by corticosteroid dose.</P>
<P>Statistical analysis</P>
<P>The extracted data were converted into individual 2x2 tables (relapse versus no relapse x corticosteroid versus placebo) for each of the individual studies. Individual 2x2 tables were stratified for various time points within the studies. The presence of significant heterogeneity among studies was tested using the chi-square test. Because this is a relatively insensitive test for the presence of heterogeneity, a p-value of 0.10 was regarded as statistically significant. For none of the analyses was the p-value for the chi-square statistic less than 0.10 and thus results of individual studies were combined into a summary test statistic. The 2x2 tables were synthesized into a summary test statistic using the pooled odds ratio and 95% confidence intervals as described by Cochran and Mantel and Haenszel (the 'odds ratio' in MetaView). A fixed effects model was used for the pooling of data.</P>
</DATA_COLLECTION>
</METHODS>
<RESULTS>
<STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<P>An updated literature search performed in July 2008 did not identify any new trials. A total of 8 studies were identified as being potentially eligible for inclusion in the analysis based upon a review of the title of the paper and, where available, the abstract. Of these studies, 3 were identified by the reviewers as being eligible for inclusion. Agreement among reviewers regarding the eligibility of the included studies was 100%. Five studies were excluded based on review of the full published papers or, in one case, after obtaining additional information from the study's principal author. The <LINK REF="STD-Brignola-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Brignola 1988</LINK> study was initially rated as being possibly eligible following review of the full paper. Because a clear determination of eligibility could not be made based upon the information provided in the paper, additional information was obtained from the author. It was then determined that the study was not eligible for inclusion because it did not have a placebo control and patients were not blinded to treatment assignment.</P>
<P>In the study by Smith and colleagues (<LINK REF="STD-Smith-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 1978</LINK>) from Cardiff, Wales, 64 patients with Crohn's disease who were free from symptoms were randomized to receive either prednisone 7.5 mg daily or placebo. The patients comprised a mixture of those who had undergone surgery within the previous 12 months, with (n = 26) or without (n = 11) residual disease, and those who had been known to have had active disease within the previous 12 months but had not undergone surgery (n = 22). Eight patients already receiving sulphasalazine prior to entry into the trial remained on therapy. Twenty-nine patients had disease of the small bowel only, 23 had disease of both small and large bowel, and 7 had disease of the large bowel only. Patients were followed every 6 months for up to 3 years. Relapse was defined as recurrent or persistent abdominal symptoms requiring open-label prednisone therapy. The decision to start open-label prednisone was made by at least two clinicians. If patients responded to therapy and were able to wean off prednisone within 6 weeks they continued in the study and resumed the study medication. Five patients dropped out within a few months of randomization and were excluded leaving a total of 59 available for analysis. Fifty four patients remained in the study after 18 months and 30 remained after three years. The study found no overall difference in the withdrawal rate between the prednisone and the placebo treated groups. In addition, of the 26 patients with previous resection and no residual disease only two experienced a disease relapse, one in each of the prednisone and placebo groups. </P>
<P>The National Co-operative Crohn's Disease Study was carried out at 14 centres in the United States (<LINK REF="STD-NCCDS-1979" TYPE="STUDY">NCCDS 1979</LINK>). It was designed to study the relative and absolute effectiveness of prednisone, sulfasalazine and azathioprine in the treatment of acute symptoms of Crohn's disease (Part I, Phase 1) and in the long term maintenance of remission (Part I, Phase 2 and Part II). In Part I, phase 2 patients who were treated for acute symptoms of Crohn's disease (as participants in Part I, Phase 1) and who entered into clinical remission (CDAI &lt; 150) after 17 weeks of therapy were maintained on the therapy (prednisone, sulfasalazine, azathioprine or placebo) which induced remission and followed for up to 24 months. Since the randomization process took place prior to acute therapy and patients were not re-randomized to one of the possible maintenance therapies that portion of the study was not considered to be eligible for inclusion in the meta-analysis. </P>
<P>In Part II of the NCCDS, 274 patients who had quiescent disease either by virtue of surgical resection within the previous year (n = 48) or by means of medical therapy (n = 226) were randomized to receive one of the four treatments. Of the total group, 101 patients were randomized to receive placebo and 61 were randomized to receive prednisone 0.25 mg/kg/d (maximum daily dose = 20 mg). Approximately 44% of patients had only small bowel involvement, 46% had both small and large bowel involvement and 10% had only large bowel involvement. Forty-nine percent of the placebo group and 45% of the prednisone group had previous abdominal surgery for Crohn's disease and approximately one-third of both groups had been treated with steroids in the two weeks prior to randomization. Patients were followed for up to 2 years and were considered to have suffered a treatment failure if they had a CDAI &gt; 150 (and more than 100 points above baseline), required surgery, developed a new fistula, had persistent fever or had significant worsening of barium x-rays. All patients randomized were accounted for at the end of one year and 57/101 placebo and 37/61 prednisone treated patients were accounted for at the end of two years. Results of the study showed no difference between placebo and prednisone treated groups with respect to outcome ranking scores (according to adversity of outcome) and to the proportion of patients in remission. Subgroup analysis according to surgical status or prior use of steroids reported only scores for outcome ranking with placebo favouring better than prednisone in the post-operative group with borderline statistical significance. No subgroup analyses were reported according to the proportion of patients in remission.</P>
<P>The European Cooperative Crohn's Disease Study involved 13 study centres in Germany, Denmark and Switzerland (<LINK REF="STD-ECCDS-1984" TYPE="STUDY">ECCDS 1984</LINK>). Like the NCCDS trial the ECCDS was designed to evaluate the effectiveness of several therapeutic regimens for acute and chronic treatment of Crohn's disease. A total of 237 patients with quiescent Crohn's disease, as defined by a CDAI &lt; 150, were randomized to receive either placebo (n = 52), 6-methylprednisolone 8 mg/d (n = 66), sulfasalazine or a combination of 6-methylprednisolone and sulfasalazine. Patients were followed for up to 24 months and were considered treatment failures if they experienced any of the following outcomes: death due to Crohn's disease, surgery for Crohn's disease, development of a new fistula or abscess, persistent fever, worsening radiographic or endoscopic appearance or CDAI &gt; 150. If the CDAI exceeded 150, acute phase treatment with increased dose of placebo or 6-methylprednisolone (48 mg/d tapered back down to 8 mg/d over a period of six weeks) was initiated. Thirteen patients in the placebo group and 22 in the steroid group withdrew as a result of non-compliance, technical reasons (e.g. pregnancy) or drug side effects. According to the life table analysis method for the outcome of "failure and relapse" no statistical difference was found between the two groups with respect to the proportion of patients remaining in remission over the two year study period.</P>
<P>The ECCDS also included a cohort of patients who had active disease (CDAI greater than or equal to 150) at randomization and who, if entering into remission on active therapy over 6 weeks, were continued on the treatment to which they were originally assigned for up to 2 years. As was the case in Part I, Phase 2 of the NCCDS, the randomization process took place prior to acute therapy and patients were not re-randomized to one of the possible maintenance therapies. As a result, that portion of the ECCDS was not considered to be eligible for inclusion in the meta-analysis.</P>

<STUDY_QUALITY>
<P>Methodological quality of the included studies was assessed by two authors (AMG, AHS) on a scale ranging from 0 to 100 according the <LINK REF="REF-Chalmers-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chalmers 1981</LINK> criteria. Disagreements were resolved by consensus.</P>
<P>The <LINK REF="STD-NCCDS-1979" TYPE="STUDY">NCCDS 1979</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-ECCDS-1984" TYPE="STUDY">ECCDS 1984</LINK> were both rated as being of high methodological quality (scores of 84 and 83 respectively) whereas the <LINK REF="STD-Smith-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 1978</LINK> study was rated lower (41) as a result of issues related to prior estimates of sample size, method of randomization, handling of withdrawals, monitoring of compliance, reporting of endpoints, and statistical analysis. </P>
<P>The small number of studies did not permit reasonable sensitivity analyses based upon quality scores.</P>

<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
<P>The data were homogeneous with P = 0.22, P = 0.15, and P = 0.71 at 6, 12 and 24 months respectively.</P>
<P>The proportion of patients suffering disease relapse was analyzed for the three eligible studies and for the combined data at 6, 12 and 24 months following study entry. None of the studies demonstrated a statistically significant advantage or disadvantage for active treatment relative to placebo. The total number of subjects included in the analysis at the three time points were 142, 131 and 95 for the corticosteroid group and 161, 138 and 87 for the control group. The odds ratios of relapse and the corresponding 95% confidence intervals were 0.71 (0.39 to 1.31), 0.82 (0.47 to 1.43) and 0.72 (0.38 to 1.35) at 6, 12 and 24 months respectively. </P>
<P>Adequate safety data were not available in the studies to allow comparison of adverse event rates in patients receiving corticosteroids as compared to those receiving placebo.</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2008-07-14 13:54:45 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="John K MacDonald">
<P>The opinions of physicians regarding the effectiveness of corticosteroids for the maintenance of remission of Crohn's disease have been greatly influenced by the results of the three randomized controlled trials which have attempted to examine this issue. As a result, many physicians believe that corticosteroids do not maintain remission in Crohn's disease and attempt to limit their long term use. In order to do so, physicians may try to repeatedly taper and wean corticosteroids following induction of remission. This may result in a flare of disease activity in approximately 50% of patients while the corticosteroid dose is being tapered or shortly after their discontinuation (<LINK REF="REF-Modigliani-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Modigliani 1996</LINK>). This may then result in further courses of corticosteroid treatment at moderate to high doses and this in turn may lead to additional side effects and toxicity. Other physicians attempt to introduce so-called "steroid sparing agents" such as the immune modulators azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine. Although it has been suggested that azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine are effective for the treatment of Crohn's disease (<LINK REF="REF-Pearson-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pearson 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pearson-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pearson 1998</LINK>;<LINK REF="REF-Sandborn-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sandborn 1998</LINK>), there is a potential for toxicity when taken for several months, especially in young patients.</P>
<P>When the data from the NCCDS and the ECCDS are carefully examined it is apparent that there is a subgroup of patients who appeared to have benefited from an initial course of corticosteroids followed by continuing therapy. In Part I (Phases 1 and 2) of the NCCDS, 31% of patients who received corticosteroids avoided treatment failure or relapse over two years, as compared to only 9% of the placebo group. In the ECCDS the subgroup of patients who had active disease at randomization and received 6-methylprednisolone experienced a lower rate of "failure and relapse" as compared to those who received placebo. However, when only those patients who were in remission at the time of initial randomization were considered (Part II of the NCCDS and patients in the ECCDS with CDAI &lt; 150), no statistically significant benefit of corticosteroid treatment was found to exist. As a result of the predetermined criteria outlined for inclusion of studies in this meta-analysis the maintenance arm of the NCCDS (Part I, Phase 2) was not included. In addition, patients in the ECCDS who had active Crohn's disease at the time of randomization were similarly excluded. Despite these exclusions, and the fact that the three studies included in the present meta-analysis each consisted of heterogeneous groups of patients, each of the included studies demonstrated a trend toward benefit of corticosteroid therapy relative to placebo with similar individual odds ratios among the studies at 6, 12 and 24 months of therapy. These studies included patients with remissions induced both by medical and surgical therapy, patients with remissions of long and short duration, patients with varying sites of disease involvement and patients with and without recent prior use of corticosteroids. It is possible that, by examining more homogeneous subgroups of patients, one might be able to determine patient characteristics that will predict either favourable or unfavourable responses to maintenance corticosteroid therapy. Unfortunately, the studies analyzed here did not provide adequate data whereby these determinations might have been made nor is it likely that there would have been sufficient numbers of patients within given subgroups to allow for adequate power to detect important differences in response.</P>
<P>One study (<LINK REF="STD-Brignola-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Brignola 1988</LINK>) suggested that corticosteroids may have a role in the maintenance of clinical remission in a subgroup of high risk patients. This study was excluded from the meta-analysis because no placebo tablets were provided to the control group and, as a result, it was not a double-blind study. The study included patients in clinical remission with a CDAI &lt; 150 but with elevated laboratory parameters suggestive of active inflammation. In that patient group it appeared that corticosteroid therapy reduced the risk of relapse over the six month study period. Although the study was clearly flawed and of short duration it does support the notion that there may be a role for maintenance corticosteroid therapy that is being obscured within the heterogeneous patient population of the published randomized, double-blind studies.</P>
<P>Unfortunately, data regarding the occurrence and severity of adverse events were not adequately presented in the original research papers and, as a result, no conclusions can be arrived at with respect to the relative safety of long-term corticosteroid use in the setting of Crohn's disease. In addition, little attention appears to have paid to the important long-term complications such as osteoporosis, cataracts and avascular necrosis.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>Routine use of corticosteroid therapy for the maintenance of remission in Crohn's disease cannot be recommended based upon the available evidence. Although the overall treatment effect was not clinically or statistically significant there may be subgroups of patients, such as those requiring multiple repeated courses of high dose corticosteroids for the treatment of acute symptoms or those with elevated laboratory parameters of inflammation, who would benefit from chronic continuous low dose (in the range of 7.5 to 15 mg of prednisone daily) corticosteroid therapy. The long term efficacy of such a strategy and its long term safety profile has not yet been evaluated.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>The randomized controlled trials performed to date have yet to conclusively answer the question regarding the role of maintenance corticosteroid therapy in Crohn's disease. There is still the need for additional studies, particularly in the population of patients with frequent disease flares requiring corticosteroid therapy. When designing such studies investigators should consider the inclusion of treatment arms other than just placebo and systemic corticosteroids. The effectiveness of systemic corticosteroids could be compared to that of immunomodulatory drugs such as azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine or that of newer topically active corticosteroids such as budesonide. It is important that patient subgroups be clearly defined and their outcomes reported. It is also important that adverse outcomes be carefully evaluated and reported including changes in bone mineral density.</P>

<CHAR_METHODS>
<P>Randomized, parallel group, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Study medication packaged centrally and labeled with code number. Placebo tablets looked like corresponding active tablet.</P>
</CHAR_METHODS>
<CHAR_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>All patients with Crohn's disease seen by the collaborating European centres were considered for admission. Patients who had quiescent disease (Crohn's diesease activity index [CDAI] &lt; 150) were eligible. Patients less than 18 years of age or who had a diagnosis of Crohn's disease more than 2 years prior to the start of the study and those who were pregnant or anticipating pregnancy were excluded. A total of 237 patients with quiescent disease were randomized.</P>
</CHAR_PARTICIPANTS>
<CHAR_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>Patients received either: 1) placebo; 2) sulphasalazine 3 g/d; 3) 6-methylprednisolone 8 mg/d; or 4) combination sulphasalazine 3 g/d and 6-methylprednisolone 8 mg/d for up to 2 years.</P>
</CHAR_INTERVENTIONS>
<CHAR_OUTCOMES>
<P>"Relapse" was deemed to be a worsening of the CDAI to a level of greater than 150. "Failure" had several definitions including: death due to Crohn's disease, pending surgery for complications of Crohn's disease, development of new fistulas or abscesses, persistence of fever for &gt; 14 consecutive days, rise of CDAI during an acute phase treatment cycle, no change or insignificant decrease of CDAI (&lt; 60 points) during 3 cycles of acute phase treatment, failure to achieve CDAI &lt; 150 or results of interim barium radiograph or endoscopic examination which documented a worsening of the patient's condition compared to the baseline examination.</P>
</CHAR_OUTCOMES>
<CHAR_NOTES>
<P>1) Details of the study patient characteristics were not available for the group of patients with quiescent disease alone but were given for the overall group of both active and quiescent disease. <BR/>2) Although it appears that "treatment failure" was defined as a CDAI &gt; 150 and a need to institute an acute phase treatment, worsening of interim barium radiograph or endoscopic examination was also listed as a possible reason for treatment failure. Such worsening was the reason for discontinuation in one patient in the 6-methylprednisolone group, five patients in the sulphasalazine group, one patient in the combination group and no patients in the placebo group.<BR/>3) Patients who developed a "relapse" as defined by a CDAI score &gt; 150 had the opportunity to receive acute phase treatment cycles without discontinuation from the trial if they responded to treatment. However, it appears that the life table from which the outcome data was derived used "failure and relapse" as the endpoint so that such patients would have been counted as an "outcome" once the CDAI rose above 150.</P>

<INCLUDED_CHAR STUDY_ID="STD-NCCDS-1979">
<CHAR_METHODS>
<P>Randomized, parallel group, placebo-controlled trial. Study drugs and/or identical placebo tablets were supplied to study patients. Patients all received at least two varieties of tablets.</P>
</CHAR_METHODS>
<CHAR_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>Patients with established diagnosis of Crohn's disease who were actively being followed at one of 14 NCCDS study centres and who had a CDAI score of less than or equal to 150 were eligible. Patients with proctitis only, children under age 15, women who were pregnant or who planned to become pregnant during the study, patients with active tuberculosis or systemic fungal infection, patients with diabetes, significant liver disease or hypertension requiring more than thiazide therapy were excluded. <BR/>A total of 274 patients (133 females, 141 males) were randomized. Of these, 127 (46%) had prior abdominal surgery for Crohn's disease, 25 (9.3%) had colonic disease only, 120 (48.8%) had small bowel disease only and 149 (41.9%) had both small bowel and colonic diseae. Mean age was 31.8 years.</P>
</CHAR_PARTICIPANTS>
<CHAR_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>Patients were randomized to one of four treatment arms: 1) placebo; 2) prednisone 0.25 mg/kg/d; 3) azathioprine 1 mg/kg/d; or 4) sulphasalazine 0.5 g/15 kg/d for a period of up to 24 months. Patients who were reactive to intermediate strength PPD (purified protein derivative) were given isoniazid 300 mg/d as tuberculosis prophylaxis.</P>
</CHAR_INTERVENTIONS>
<CHAR_OUTCOMES>
<P>Primary outcome was "relapse" defined as withdrawal from the study for any of the following reasons: CDAI &gt; 150 and over 100 points greater than initial CDAI for two consecutive weeks, need for surgery, development of new fistula other than simple fistula-in-ano, persistence of daily fever for over 14 days in a row, and interim barium x-rays judged at the study centre to be worse than the initial x-rays.</P>
</CHAR_OUTCOMES>
<CHAR_NOTES>
<P>1) Included 48 patients with surgical resection within 1 year of randomization and no evidence of recurrent disease.<BR/>2) "Relapse" definition included radiological worsening.

<CHAR_METHODS>
<P>Randomized, parallel group, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Patients were randomly allocated to receive either prednisone or identical placebo tablets.</P>
</CHAR_METHODS>
<CHAR_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>Patients with Crohn's disease recruited from one centre in Wales. Eligible patients included those who were free from symptoms and in whom there was no indication for steroid treatment. Patients were divided into 3 subgroups: I) bowel resection within 1 year with no residual disease; II) bowel resection within 1 year but with residual disease; III) active Crohn's disease within previous 12 months but no surgery during that time. Patients were excluded if they were more than 60 years of age, had evidence of liver disease, active peptic ulcer, severe hypertension, diabetes, previous pulmonary tuberculosis or were pregnant.</P>
<P>59 patients were available for these analyses.</P>
</CHAR_PARTICIPANTS>
<CHAR_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>Prednisone 7.5 mg/d or placebo for up to 3 years. Children under 15 years of age received prednisone 7.5 mg on alternate days. Eight patients continued pre-existing sulphasalazine therapy (dose range 1 - 5 g/d). Lomotil, kaolin, vitamins and folic acid were permitted co-interventions.</P>
</CHAR_INTERVENTIONS>
<CHAR_OUTCOMES>
<P>Clinical relapse as defined by a requirement for additional or open-label prednisone to control recurrent or persistent abdominal symptoms. At least two clinicians were involved in the decision to initiate open label prednisone.</P>
</CHAR_OUTCOMES>
<CHAR_NOTES>
<P>1) Eight of 33 patients in the prednisone group and 6 of 26 patients in the control group withdrew from the study. This was presumed to be due to treatment failure or relapse. Additional unreported patients may have been withdrawn during the first 6 months following randomization for reasons other than those due to Crohn's disease. These patients were not included in the report.<BR/>2) A single relapse managed by a course of open label corticosteroids no longer than 6 weeks was permitted without considering it to be a treatment failure or relapse. This occurred in 5 patients (4 prednisone and 1 control).</P>
