<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2008-10-09 14:02:18 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<P>Recipients of a kidney transplants have a pre-existing increase in bone fragility resulting from kidney disease. Bone mineral density decreases rapidly in the first year after engraftment and there is continued bone loss through the period of transplantation. The incidence of fracture following successful transplantation is greater than 2% per annum. Bone loss and fracture risk are significantly higher than both the general and dialysis population. This study examines the benefits and risks of treatments used to reduce bone disease following kidney transplantation. Twenty-four trials (12,99 patients) were included. No individual intervention (bisphosphonate, vitamin D sterol or calcitonin) has been shown in randomised controlled trials to reduce fracture risk after kidney transplantation. Meta analysis of all available such trials combined, however, shows that any intervention (bisphosphonate, vitamin D sterol, <I>or</I> calcitonin) for bone disease in kidney transplant recipients does reduce the risk of fracture in this population. These agents also provide a significant improvement in bone mineral density when given after transplantation, although the clinical significance of this is uncertain due to the lack of validation in bone densitometry in chronic kidney disease. Bisphosphonates have greater efficacy to preserve bone mineral density than vitamin D sterols in head-to-head trials.</P>

<ABSTRACT MODIFIED="2008-10-09 15:22:04 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Patients with chronic kidney disease have significant abnormalities of bone remodeling and mineral homeostasis and are at increased risk of fracture. The fracture risk for a kidney transplant recipient is four times that of the general population and higher than for a patient on dialysis. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) report the use of bisphosphonates, vitamin D sterols, calcitonin, and hormone replacement therapy to treat bone disease following transplantation.</P>

<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To evaluate the use of interventions for treating bone disease following kidney transplantation.</P>

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2008-10-09 14:01:51 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL in <I>The Cochrane Library</I>), Cochrane Renal Group's specialised register, MEDLINE, EMBASE, reference lists, and conference proceedings abstracts without language restriction.<BR/>
</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>RCTs and quasi-RCTs comparing different treatments for kidney transplant recipients of any age were selected. We excluded all other transplant recipients, including kidney-pancreas transplant recipients.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2008-10-09 15:22:04 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<P>Two authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. Statistical analyses were performed using the random effects model and the results expressed as risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous variables and mean difference (MD) for continuous outcomes.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Twenty-four trials (1,299 patients) were included. No individual intervention (bisphosphonates, vitamin D sterol or calcitonin) was associated with a reduction in fracture risk compared with placebo. Combining results for all active interventions against placebo demonstrated any treatment of bone disease was associated with a reduction in the RR of fracture (RR 0.51, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.99). Bisphosphonates (any route), vitamin D sterol, and calcitonin all had a beneficial effect on the bone mineral density at the lumbar spine. Bisphosphonates and vitamin D sterol also had a beneficial effect on the bone mineral density at the femoral neck. Bisphosphonates had greater efficacy for preventing bone mineral density loss when compared head-to-head with vitamin D sterols. Few or no data were available for combined hormone replacement, testosterone, selective oestrogen receptor modulators, fluoride or anabolic steroids. Other outcomes including all-cause mortality and drug-related toxicity were reported infrequently.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>Treatment with a bisphosphonate, vitamin D sterol or calcitonin after kidney transplantation may protect against immunosuppression-induced reductions in bone mineral density and prevent fracture. Adequately powered trials are required to determine whether bisphosphonates are better than vitamin D sterols for fracture prevention in this population. The optimal route, timing, and duration of administration of these interventions remains unknown.</P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2008-10-09 15:23:21 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Patient survival after kidney transplantation has improved progressively (<LINK REF="REF-Hariharan-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hariharan 2001</LINK>). Attention is focused increasingly on the prevention of late complications of transplantation and improving quality of life by addressing factors that affect long-term morbidity including cardiovascular risk, post-transplantation diabetes mellitus, cancer and bone disease. The bone disease that develops after kidney transplantation is important as fractures impact on well-being. At the time of kidney transplantation the uraemic state has already caused significant abnormalities of bone remodeling and mineralisation to cause renal osteodystrophy and increased bone fragility (<LINK REF="REF-Cunningham-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cunningham 2004</LINK>). Heterogeneous abnormalities of bone turnover and bone mineral density already exist before the patient requires renal replacement therapy.</P>
<P>Patients with chronic kidney disease are at increased risk for fracture, with a vertebral fracture prevalence of 21% and relative risk (RR) for hip fracture increased up to 14-fold (<LINK REF="REF-Sprague-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sprague 2004</LINK>). The fracture risk for kidney transplant recipients is four times that of the general population and is increased when compared with haemodialysis patients (<LINK REF="REF-Grotz-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grotz 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Veenstra-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Veenstra 1999</LINK>). After transplantation bone fragility is contributed to by medication, abnormal vitamin D metabolism, renal insufficiency and persistent hyperparathyroidism. Studies report a fracture prevalence of 7% to 60% (<LINK REF="REF-Durieux-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Durieux 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Giannini-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Giannini 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Monier_x002d_Faugere-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Monier-Faugere 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nisbeth-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nisbeth 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Shaunessy-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Shaunessy 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vautour-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vautour 2004</LINK>) following successful transplantation with an incidence of 2%/year (<LINK REF="REF-Abbott-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Abbott 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Grotz-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grotz 1994</LINK>). An increased risk is seen in women, patients with diabetes, those with an increased duration of dialysis therapy, older patients, and subjects with increased time elapsed since transplantation (<LINK REF="REF-Sprague-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sprague 2004</LINK>). Recipients of a kidney transplant lose bone rapidly and early following transplantation (<LINK REF="REF-Almond-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Almond 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Horber-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Horber 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Julian-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Julian 1991</LINK>) from sites rich in trabecular bone. Bone mineral density decreases in the lumbar spine by 5% in the first year after transplantation (<LINK REF="STD-Torregrosa-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Torregrosa 2003</LINK>) and longitudinal studies in stable kidney transplant recipients demonstrate bone loss of 1.7% annually at the lumbar spine (<LINK REF="REF-Pichette-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pichette 1996</LINK>). Beyond three years after transplantation bone mineral density does not change or may increase slightly but remains below values for the normal population (<LINK REF="REF-Grotz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grotz 1995</LINK>). Fractures may occur early and affect patients with both low and normal bone mineral density. </P>
<P>Immunosuppressive agents used in solid organ transplantation exert protean effects on bone metabolism (<LINK REF="REF-Torres-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Torres 2002</LINK>). Bone formation and mineralisation lag times may be prolonged, suggesting an imbalance between bone formation and resorption through osteoblastic dysfunction (<LINK REF="REF-Monier_x002d_Faugere-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Monier-Faugere 2000</LINK>). Glucocorticoids cause a substantial loss of trabecular bone in the initial months of treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Sambrook-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sambrook 1988</LINK>), decrease calcium absorption and urinary calcium excretion, and exacerbate secondary hyperparathyroidism (<LINK REF="REF-Hahn-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hahn 1981</LINK>). Data regarding cyclosporin are conflicting although evidence suggests cyclosporin A contributes independently to lowered bone density following kidney transplantation (<LINK REF="REF-Heaf-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heaf 2000</LINK>). The roles of tacrolimus and sirolimus on bone metabolism do not extend beyond animal studies.</P>
<P>A number of agents are proven in the treatment and prevention of osteoporosis in non-transplant populations. Bisphosphonates, through their anti-resorptive properties, are efficacious in the treatment steroid-induced osteoporosis (<LINK REF="REF-Adachi-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Adachi 1997</LINK>). Vitamin D metabolism is disturbed before and after kidney transplantation where half of patients show low blood levels of 1,25 dihydroxy vitamin D until six months after engraftment (<LINK REF="STD-De-Sevaux-2002" TYPE="STUDY">De Sevaux 2002</LINK>). Active vitamin D sterol and calcium supplementation during this time reduces bone loss (<LINK REF="STD-Jeffery-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Jeffery 2003</LINK>). A recent meta-analysis suggests 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D (active vitamin D3, calcitriol) supplementation following kidney transplantation may be more efficacious in preventing vertebral fractures compared with no treatment, placebo or other vitamin D sterols with or without calcium supplementation (<LINK REF="REF-De-Nijs-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">De Nijs 2004</LINK>). Calcitonin has been proven to prevent recurrence of osteoporotic fractures in women with established osteoporosis (<LINK REF="REF-Chesnut-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chesnut 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Karachalios-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Karachalios 2004</LINK>) but data in patients receiving renal replacement therapy are absent. Following kidney transplantation female gender and post-menopausal status are associated with an exaggerated risk of bone loss (<LINK REF="REF-Hung-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hung 1996</LINK>). In non-transplant populations combined hormone replacement therapy has been shown to increase bone mineral density in post-menopausal osteoporosis (<LINK REF="REF-Grey-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grey 1994</LINK>) and testosterone treatment reverses the deleterious effects of glucocorticoid drugs on bone mass in men (<LINK REF="REF-Reid-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reid 1996</LINK>). The impact of gonadal hormone replacement following kidney transplantation is not characterised. </P>
<P>Given the heterogeneity of bone changes following transplantation the data for recommended treatment of osteoporosis may not be transferable to the specialised setting of kidney transplantation. Specialist guidelines regarding treatment of bone disease in kidney transplantation are based on uncontrolled data (additional <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK> - <I>Published guidelines for bone disease in kidney transplant recipients</I>). Randomised data are emerging specific to the treatment of bone disease in solid organ transplantation including kidney transplant recipients. This study aimed to examine these data to determine the best treatments to reduce morbidity from bone disease in kidney transplant recipients, to characterise potential harms from such treatment and to identify areas requiring further study.</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>This review examined the use of pharmacotherapeutic agents used to treat bone disease following kidney transplantation. Focus was placed on objective measures of change in the incidence of complications of bone disease, particularly the incidence of fracture. Changes in bone mineral density during follow-up would be measured. Adverse outcomes related to treatment intervention have been described including the development of adynamic bone disease and electrolyte disturbances.</P>

<P>For dichotomous outcomes (death, fracture at any site following transplantation, presence of adynamic bone disease on bone histomorphometry, acute allograft rejection, and adverse effects of treatment) results were expressed as risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Data were pooled using the random effects model but the fixed effects model was analysed to ensure robustness of the model chosen and susceptibility to outliers. Where continuous scales of measurement were used to assess the effects of treatment (e.g. changes in bone mineral density by DEXA scanning, mean serum creatinine at the end of treatment, mean haemoglobin at the end of treatment) the mean difference (MD) was used, or the standardised mean difference (SMD) if different scales were used.</P>
<P>Subgroup analysis was used to explore possible sources of heterogeneity (e.g. participants, treatments and study quality). Heterogeneity among participants could have been related to age and renal pathology. Heterogeneity in treatments could have been related to prior agent(s) used and the agent, dose and duration of therapy. Adverse effects were tabulated and assessed with descriptive techniques. Where possible, the risk difference with 95% CI was calculated for each adverse effect, either compared to no treatment or to another agent. Heterogeneity was analysed using a &#967;² test and the I² statistic (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>All available trials were selected for the purposes of systematic review regardless of the length of follow-up participation. The effect of short and long term follow up as a source of significant heterogeneity between trials was explored. Plausible explanation for variations in treatment effect was explored using subgroup analysis based on study quality, length of follow-up, population characteristics and specific interventions. The reviewers aimed to determine the applicability of the results to individual kidney transplant recipients.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Initial study selection</HEADING>
<P>The progress through the phases of this systematic review is shown in <LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>: <I>Flow chart of study identification and selection</I>. From MEDLINE 84 citations were retrieved; from EMBASE 383 citations; and from the specialised registry of the Cochrane Renal Group 169 citations. The number of potentially relevant citations identified was 518, of which 483 were excluded after title and abstract review. The major reasons for exclusion were a non-randomised design, non-bone disease related interventions, duplicate publications and review article design.</P>
<P>Full-text analysis of the remaining 36 publications found 30 eligible trials: four were non-RCTs, one enrolled pancreas-kidney transplant recipients and one was a duplicate publication. Following the exclusion of interim/early reports of main publications, 23 RCTs (30 publications), published as full articles or in abstract form, were identified and included in this review (<LINK REF="STD-Coco-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Coco 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cueto_x002d_Manzano-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Cueto-Manzano 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-De-Sevaux-2002" TYPE="STUDY">De Sevaux 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Eid-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Eid 1996</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-El_x002d_Agroudy-2003a" TYPE="STUDY">El-Agroudy 2003a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-El_x002d_Husseini-2004" TYPE="STUDY">El-Husseini 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fan-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Fan 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Giannini-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Giannini 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Grotz-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Grotz 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Grotz-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Grotz 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Haas-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Haas 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jeffrey-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jeffrey 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Koc-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Koc 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nam-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Nam 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Neubauer-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Neubauer 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nordal-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Nordal 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Psimenou-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Psimenou 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sharma-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Sharma 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Talalaj-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Talalaj 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Torregrosa-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Torregrosa 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Torres-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Torres 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ugur-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Ugur 2000</LINK>).

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2008-10-09 14:32:17 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<P>We have examined the randomised trial evidence for bone modifying treatment after kidney transplantation and provide several key findings. First, administration of bisphosphonates, vitamin D sterols with or without calcium, and calcitonin were the most extensively studied agents. Few or no data were available for combined hormone replacement, testosterone, selective oestrogen receptor modulators, fluoride, or anabolic steroids. Second, no individual RCT was powered to demonstrate a treatment-related reduction in the risk of fracture at any site following transplantation. Analyses in the updated review (2006) of all placebo-controlled trials into a single comparison (bisphosphonate, vitamin D compounds, calcitonin) showed a modest reduction in the relative risk for fracture of 49%, determined by the inclusion in a small study (El Husseini 2004). This finding required the inclusion of 32 fracture events in 514 patients followed for at least 6 months to demonstrate a beneficial treatment effect. Third, treatment with bisphosphonates, vitamin D sterols or calcitonin all had a beneficial effect on the percentage change in BMD at the lumbar spine in the first months after transplantation. Similar findings were seen for the BMD at the femoral neck, except for calcitonin. No measurable outcomes were able to be extracted for BMD changes at the radius. Lastly, reported toxicity related to treatment was uncommon, and interventions appeared to be well tolerated. Caution is required in assessment of treatment tolerability, due to the suboptimal reporting of safety data.</P>
<P>Several guidelines exist to recommend treatment approaches to reduce bone disease following transplantation (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK> - <I>Published guidelines for bone disease in kidney transplant recipients</I>). The European Best Practice Guidelines recommend all kidney transplant recipients have a measurement of bone mineral density prior to transplantation, receive ergocalciferol or calcitriol during glucocorticoid administration and have a minimal cumulative dose of glucocorticoid therapy. For patients with established osteopenia, bisphosphonate therapy is recommended for consideration, although the mode and duration of treatment is not discussed. Gonadal replacement therapy, where sex hormone insufficiency exists is recommended. The Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative recommends, similarly, that serum calcium and plasma intact parathyroid hormone be monitored at an interval based on time following transplantation. Limiting glucocorticoid doses and measurement of BMD to assess the presence or development of osteoporosis are also recommended. If a bone mineral density T score below less than - 2 SD is measured treatment with parenteral bisphosphonate is recommended. The International Congress of the Transplantation Society 2000 also recommends a pre-transplant measure of BMD by DEXA to detect established osteoporosis and every six months thereafter (<LINK REF="STD-Torregrosa-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Torregrosa 2003</LINK>). Minimal steroid dosage, supplemental vitamin D sterol and calcium, and sex hormone replacement were recommended and, where osteopenia was identified, treatment with bisphosphonates for a year was proposed. The present study supports the recommended concurrent use of vitamin D with or without calcium treatment and bisphosphonate administration to reduce the deleterious of transplantation on changes of bone mineral density. It also appears that any intervention to alter bone metabolism after transplantation can reduce the risk of fracture in 12 months of follow up. The efficacy of such treatment to reduce long term risk of fracture remains uncertain.</P>
<P>To our knowledge the present study represents the first systematic review of RCTs examining the relative benefits and harms of treatments used to reduce bone disease following kidney transplantation. A previous meta-analysis reviewed only the steroid-attributable effect of glucocorticoid treatment in kidney transplant recipients focusing on steroid avoidance or withdrawal, and included cohort studies (<LINK REF="REF-Veenstra-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Veenstra 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>The strength of this investigation is that it represents a comprehensive systematic review based on a previous publication of a detailed protocol, rigid inclusion criteria for RCTs only, and a comprehensive search of MEDLINE, EMBASE and CENTRAL. Data extraction, data analyses and method quality assessment were performed by two independent investigators, and consistency was checked with a third author. A significant number of RCTs were identified and eligible for analysis.</P>
<P>Nevertheless, several limitations of our review require consideration. The internal validity of the design, conduct, and analysis of the included RCTs was difficult to assess due to omission of important methodologic details in the trial reports. The majority of trials failed to report the method of allocation concealment, whether outcome assessors were blinded and whether intention-to-treat analysis was used. The reporting quality combined with the small sample size of all trials reduces the strength of conclusions drawn in this review. Patient populations varied between studies. For example, one trial enrolled only post-menopausal women and other trials excluded female participants to control for menopausal status. Regarding disease heterogeneity, trials differed in timing following transplantation. Treatment given at the time of transplantation, when bone loss is accelerated is likely to demonstrate a different impact on bone density outcomes compared with treatment several years after engraftment. This is particularly so where there is lack of consensus regarding the natural history of bone disease when the recipient approaches 10 years of engraftment.</P>
<P>An unexpected finding from this review was the reduction in the risk of graft rejection associated with bisphosphonate treatment. Increasing evidence is available to support the immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory properties of bisphosphonates, which may explain these review findings. Bisphosphonates appear to suppress T-cell function through suppression of cytokine release from activated macrophages/monocytes (<LINK REF="REF-Chambers-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chambers 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-de-Vries-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">de Vries 1982</LINK>) and reduce graft rejection in animal studies (<LINK REF="REF-Fryer-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fryer 1996</LINK>). Additional data for transplant patients are needed and may provide evidence of additional advantages of bisphosphonate treatment for bone disease in transplantation.</P>

<P>The following implications for practice in the prevention of bone disease in kidney transplant recipients have been identified:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Adequate data from RCTs were not able to show a benefit of individual treatment agents on fracture risk in kidney transplant recipients. Further adequately powered trials of commonly used bisphosphonates (alendronate, pamidronate) compared with vitamin D sterols (calcitriol) are required.</LI>
<LI>The combined analysis of any intervention for prevention of bone disease (bisphosphonate, vitamin D sterol, or calcitonin) shows a modest reduction in the relative risk of fracture by 49% after 6 to 12 months of treatment in recipients of a kidney transplant. This finding depends on the number of patients in this combined analysis allowing adequate power to determine a change in fracture rate between any treatment and placebo/no treatment. </LI>
<LI>Treatment with bisphosphonates, vitamin D sterol or calcitonin at any time following kidney transplantation has a favourable effect on bone mineral density. The optimal agent, route of administration, and duration of treatment are not known.</LI>
<LI>No significant adverse effects of intervention are identified.</LI>
<LI>Bisphosphonates confer protection against acute graft rejection.</LI>

<UL>
<LI>Individual bisphosphonate agents compared with placebo or vitamin D sterol on risk of fracture after transplantation</LI>
<LI>The optimal time after transplantation to commence treatment to reduce fracture risk</LI>
<LI>Patients with significantly impaired graft function</LI>
<LI>Longer term outcomes for fracture risk and graft function (i.e. greater than 12 months)</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<BR/>Current data in our meta-analyses suggest a fracture incidence of 8.8% to 15% in untreated groups during follow-up compared with 2% to 9.2% where treatment is utilised. It is estimated a trial with a power of 80% to demonstrate a reduction in the risk of fracture of 50% would require 266 enrolments. Realistically this trial would take several years to accrue patients and could be considered appropriate for a multi-centre study. A trial comparing bisphosphonate treatment, commenced at the time of transplantation, with a follow-up of 36 to 60 months compared with placebo and using the primary outcome measure of incidence of fracture should be considered by future investigators.</P>
