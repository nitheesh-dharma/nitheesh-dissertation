<P>
<B>Review question</B>
</P>
<P>We examined the effects of inhaling heated, humidified air delivered by a device (RhinoTherm) for people with common cold.</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>Common cold is the most common infection in humans. It does not usually cause complications, but can lead to days off work or school due to discomfort caused by symptoms. The diagnosis is based on symptoms, and the treatments are mainly symptomatic. Symptoms include fever, loss of appetite, feeling unwell, feeling chilled, with headache, muscle aches, and pains. Many signs and symptoms are caused by congestion from swelling of membranes and thickened mucus inside the nose. The common cold has been treated for decades with inhaled steam to help the mucus drain more easily. There is laboratory evidence that the cold virus may be sensitive to heat, but no large scale clinical trials have tested its effectiveness. Steam inhalation continues to be used because it provides subjective relief of common cold symptoms.</P>
<P>
<B>Search date</B>
</P>
<P>The search is current to 24 February 2017.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics </B>
</P>
<P>We included six randomised, double-blind trials from five publications involving a total of 387 participants published between 1987 and 1995 in the English language. All included trials used the RhinoTherm device, which delivered heated, humidified air for different lengths of time and at different flow rates to treat common cold symptoms. Three trials were conducted in the USA, two in the UK, and one in Israel. Most studies recruited people with naturally occurring colds, but one study induced colds by infecting participants.</P>
<P>
<B>Study funding sources</B>
</P>
<P>The RhinoTherm devices were provided by Netzer Sereni in four studies and A Beacham in two studies. One study was funded by Cleveland Clinic internal funding, and another was supported by authors' discretionary funds. The remaining studies did not mention funding sources.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>None of the included studies reported any worsening in clinical symptom scores after inhaling heated, humidified air. Participants in two trials showed a lack of persistent symptoms, however the results were inconsistent. Two studies reported minor adverse events. There was no effect of treatment on rhinovirus shedding.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of evidence</B>
</P>
<P>Using GRADE criteria, we assessed the quality of the evidence as low for the outcomes reduction in the clinical severity of the common cold (measured by decrease in the symptom score index); number of participants with the subjective response: therapy did not help; and number of participants with a positive viral culture in the nasal washings, due to risk of bias and inconsistency of the study results.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2017-08-23 05:54:49 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Heated, humidified air has long been used by people with the common cold. The theoretical basis is that steam may help congested mucus drain better and that heat may destroy the cold virus as it does in vitro. This is an update of a review last published in 2013.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2017-08-23 05:55:32 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>To assess the effects of inhaling heated water vapour (steam) in the treatment of the common cold by comparing symptoms, viral shedding, and nasal resistance.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2017-08-29 08:19:39 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Liz Dooley">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (to February 2017), MEDLINE (1966 to 24 February 2017), Embase (1990 to 24 February 2017), and Current Contents (1998 to 24 February 2017). We also searched World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP) (8 March 2017) and ClinicalTrials.gov (8 March 2017) as well as reference lists of included studies.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2017-08-23 05:58:53 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Randomised controlled trials using heated water vapour in participants with the common cold or experimentally induced common cold were eligible for inclusion.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2017-08-23 06:00:44 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Three review authors independently screened titles and abstracts for inclusion of potential studies identified from the search. We recorded the selection process in sufficient detail to complete a PRISMA flow diagram. We used a data collection form for study characteristics and outcome data that was developed and used for previous versions of this review. Two review authors independently extracted data, and a third review author resolved any disagreements. We used Review Manager 5 software to analyse data.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-08-23 06:15:07 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included six trials from five publications involving a total of 387 participants. We included no new studies in this 2017 update. The 'Risk of bias' assessment suggested an unclear risk of bias in the domain of randomisation and a low risk of bias in performance, detection, attrition, and reporting.</P>
<P>It was uncertain whether heated, humidified air provides symptomatic relief for the common cold, as the fixed-effect analysis showed evidence of an effect (odds ratio (OR) 0.30, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.16 to 0.56; 2 studies, 149 participants), but the random-effects analysis showed no significant difference in the results (OR 0.22, 95% CI 0.03 to 1.95)<I>.</I> There is an argument for using either form of analysis. No studies demonstrated an exacerbation of clinical symptom scores. One study conducted in the USA demonstrated worsened nasal resistance, but an earlier Israeli study showed improvement. One study examined viral shedding in nasal washings, finding no significant difference between treatment and placebo groups (OR 0.47, 95% CI 0.04 to 5.19). As judged by the subjective response to therapy (i.e. therapy did not help), the number of participants reporting resolution of symptoms was not significantly higher in the heated humidified group (OR 0.58, 95% CI 0.28 to 1.18; 2 studies, 124 participants). There was significant heterogeneity in the effects of heated, humidified air on different outcomes, therefore we graded the quality of the evidence as low. Some studies reported minor adverse events (including discomfort or irritation of the nose).</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2017-08-23 06:18:23 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The current evidence does not show any benefits or harms from the use of heated, humidified air delivered via the RhinoTherm device for the treatment of the common cold. There is a need for more double-blind, randomised trials that include standardised treatment modalities.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2017-08-29 08:17:40 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Liz Dooley">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2017-08-23 06:47:42 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The common cold is an acute, self limiting viral infection of the upper respiratory tract involving, sneezing, nasal congestion and discharge (rhinorrhoea), sore throat, cough, low-grade fever, headache, and malaise. Different viruses can cause the common cold, the most common of which are the more than 100 serotypes of rhinoviruses (<LINK REF="REF-Sahin-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sahin 2015</LINK>).</P>
<P>"Life is made up of sobs, sniffles and smiles, with sniffles predominating" (<LINK REF="REF-Adams-1967" TYPE="REFERENCE">Adams 1967</LINK>). Sniffles, the common cold, and other acute respiratory infections account for about 40% of employee absenteeism and about 30% of absenteeism from school (<LINK REF="REF-Predy-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Predy 2005</LINK>). Separate studies of families have shown that the average preschool child has six to 10 colds per year, and the average adult has two to four colds per year (<LINK REF="REF-Monto-1974" TYPE="REFERENCE">Monto 1974</LINK>). Care for people with the common cold imposes significant economic burden.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2017-08-23 06:52:49 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Many remedial measures such as antihistamines, decongestants, intranasal ipratropium bromide, vitamin C, interferon, and traditional remedies such as Chinese herbs, garlic, and ginseng are used in the treatment of the common cold (<LINK REF="REF-AlBalawi-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">AlBalawi 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-De-Sutter-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">De Sutter 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Karsch_x002d_Volk-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Karsch-Volk 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Smith-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smith 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zhang-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhang 2009</LINK>). Inhaling warm, damp air is thought to offer relief from symptoms of the common cold. Hot water, hot soup, and tea have been used for centuries for this purpose and have been subject to scientific investigation (<LINK REF="REF-Saketkhoo-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Saketkhoo 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sanu-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sanu 2008</LINK>).</P>

<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Lwoff-1969" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lwoff 1969</LINK> suggested that raising the mucosal temperature to 43 °C for three 30-minute periods can block rhinoviral replication and stop the common cold. Studies of the effect of heated, humidified air suggest that raising nasal mucosal temperature may inhibit rhinoviral replication (<LINK REF="STD-Forstall-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Forstall 1994</LINK>). A device to raise nasal mucosal temperature (RhinoTherm) has been developed. It has been claimed that 80% of participants who used RhinoTherm in the early stages of common cold felt better the next day (<LINK REF="STD-Ophir-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Ophir 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yerushalmi-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Yerushalmi 1980</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2017-08-29 08:17:40 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Liz Dooley">
<P>A multimillion dollar industry thrives on treatments for alleviating symptoms of the common cold (<LINK REF="REF-Fendrick-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fendrick 2003</LINK>). Treatments range from antihistamines, decongestants, antibiotics, vitamins, and minerals from the conventional medical system to several physical therapies ranging from inhaling steam with herbs, 'neti' treatment, and 'Pranayaam' from the complementary systems of medicine. The common cold and allergic rhinitis constitute a global health problem that affects social life, sleep, school and work performance, and imposes a substantial economic burden on society due to absence from work and reduced working capacity (<LINK REF="REF-Hellgren-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hellgren 2010</LINK>). Two studies estimated the productivity lost to the common cold by using a telephone-administered survey that measured three sources of loss: absenteeism, on-the-job productivity, and caregiver absenteeism (<LINK REF="REF-Bramley-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bramley 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fendrick-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fendrick 2003</LINK>). Each cold experienced by a working adult caused an average of 8.7 work hours lost (2.8 absenteeism hours and 5.9 hours of on-the-job loss) and 1.2 work hours lost due to caring for children aged under 13 years who had colds. The economic cost of lost productivity due to the common cold approaches nearly USD 25,000 million, of which USD 16,600 million is attributed to on-the-job productivity loss, USD 8000 million is attributed to absenteeism, and USD 230 million is attributed to caregiver absenteeism (<LINK REF="REF-Bramley-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bramley 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>It was therefore important to review the evidence to provide a scientific foundation for the safety and efficacy of heated, humidified air to treat common cold symptoms.</P>

<P>We included six trials from five publications (one publication included two trials that we assessed separately) that investigated heated, humidified air for the treatment of people with the common cold. The RhinoTherm devices were provided by Netzer Sereni in four studies (<LINK REF="STD-Forstall-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Forstall 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hendley-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Hendley 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Macknin-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Macknin 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ophir-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Ophir 1987</LINK>), and by A Beacham in two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Tyrrell-1989a" TYPE="STUDY">Tyrrell 1989a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tyrrell-1989b" TYPE="STUDY">Tyrrell 1989b</LINK>). One study was funded by Cleveland Clinic internal funding (<LINK REF="STD-Forstall-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Forstall 1994</LINK>), while another study was supported by authors' discretionary funds (<LINK REF="STD-Hendley-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Hendley 1994</LINK>). The remaining studies did not mention funding sources (<LINK REF="STD-Macknin-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Macknin 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ophir-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Ophir 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tyrrell-1989a" TYPE="STUDY">Tyrrell 1989a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tyrrell-1989b" TYPE="STUDY">Tyrrell 1989b</LINK>).</P>
<P>Three trials reported benefits of heated, humidified air for symptom relief in people with the common cold (<LINK REF="STD-Ophir-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Ophir 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tyrrell-1989a" TYPE="STUDY">Tyrrell 1989a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tyrrell-1989b" TYPE="STUDY">Tyrrell 1989b</LINK>). However, sample sizes were small. Results on symptom indices were equivocal. No studies demonstrated an exacerbation of clinical symptom scores (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Forstall-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Forstall 1994</LINK>
 demonstrated worsened nasal resistance, but <LINK REF="STD-Ophir-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Ophir 1987</LINK> showed improvements. <LINK REF="STD-Hendley-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Hendley 1994</LINK> examined viral shedding in nasal washings through cultures, finding no difference between treatment and placebo groups.

</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2017-08-29 08:27:01 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Liz Dooley">
<P>We aimed to examine the evidence for heated, humidified air delivered using a RhinoTherm device for treating the common cold. The trials assessed participants that included healthy volunteers with experimentally-induced cold. This added an element of indirectness. The small sample sizes and the fact that all outcomes were not addressed made the effect estimates susceptible to change. The included trials are now more than two decades old, and we identified no new studies (completed or ongoing) for this update. Hence, cautious interpretation of the findings is suggested.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2017-08-28 17:39:44 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We used GRADE (<LINK REF="REF-GRADEpro-GDT-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">GRADEpro GDT 2014</LINK>), as described in Chapter 12 of the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Sch_x00fc_nemann-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schünemann 2011</LINK>), to assess the quality and certainty of the evidence (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>). The existing evidence was of low quality, which implies that further research is very likely to change our effect estimates.</P>
<P>We downgraded the evidence for potential risk of bias, inconsistency among the trials, imprecision and indirectness of the trials. We attributed imprecision and inconsistency to the small sample sizes of the trials.</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2017-08-28 16:47:45 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We were unable to pool the data for most outcomes due to a lack of included studies reporting the outcome. We could not estimate publication bias due to the small number of included studies. We aimed to reduce bias in the review process by using a standardised search strategy and including studies up to the most recent search date. We performed searching and data extraction according to the recommendations in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011b</LINK>). The strength of this review is in the inclusion of studies using similar methodologies and instrument for the intervention.  There was a difference in the duration of warm vapour inhalation, with a longer period (30 minutes) associated with no benefit and increased resistance of the nasal passages. We found potential biases in most included studies (unclear risk of bias for randomisation and allocation concealment).</P>

<P>There is a need for large, multicentre studies using rhinothermy to treat the symptoms of the common cold, including a detailed cost-benefit analysis of using this device. The outcome measures should be dependent upon the frequency of common cold symptoms and a definitive diagnosis based on viral cultures, using a uniform symptom score index and nasal resistance measurements.</P>

<P>In this 2017 update, we moved the secondary outcome "Number of participants with no symptoms" to the primary outcomes and rephrased it as "Number of participants with subjective response: therapy did not help" because we believed it addressed an important question &#8203;about the&#8203; efficacy of heated, humidified air. We also rephrased the secondary outcome "Decrease in viral culture titre in the nasal secretions" to " Number of participants with a positive viral culture in the nasal washings", as it added clarity for the readers about what exactly is reported in the review.</P>

Percentage change in score from baseline was calculated for each participant. Both groups had identical symptom experiences, as measured by the participant and investigator symptom index cards. Placebo participants had a higher initial nasal resistance than the treatment participants (6.0 versus 3.9, P = 0.04). The unit of measurement of nasal resistance is percentage of change</P>

<FEEDBACK_SUMMARY MODIFIED="2017-03-09 17:01:25 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>1. I am delighted to see this review: a common and important but long neglected problem - and a marvellous introductory quote! I hope my comments may help you clarify some aspects.</P>
<P>2. Objectives: it would be good to specify the comparisons to be made in the review.</P>
<P>3. Types of participants: the treatment group includes people with "acute viral rhinopharyngitis" [avr], but the control group does not. Is avr synonymous with "common cold"? Healthy volunteers inoculated with virus are not patients, nor are people with a spontaneous or 'natural' cold who have not consulted a health professional.</P>
<P>4. Types of intervention: "... delivering hot humidified air ... at 40-44 deg C." This should exclude the <LINK REF="STD-Forstall-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Forstall 1994</LINK> study, in which the air was delivered at 47 deg, or if it is included it must at least be analysed separately. It would be useful to add an illustration of the Rhinotherm apparatuses - say line drawings.</P>
<P>5. Types of outcome measures: detailed reporting and discussion of the symptom scores used in the trials is necessary. They are unlikely to have used the same scoring methods, and cannot be combined without explicit justification.</P>
<P>6. Methods of the review: the validity score used assumes that all the points are equally important, and is therefore misleading. As the Cochrane Reviewers' Handbook 4.0 [end of section 6.7.2] says " ... it is preferable to ... report how each trial scored on each criterion".</P>
<P>7. Results: the results should be reported separately for each of the different comparisons to be made, and also separately for each of the 5 outcome measures. Only then will it be possible to decide whether it is appropriate to lump together any of the comparisons or the<BR/>outcome measures. In the absence of such an analysis the MetaView summary cannot be interpreted.</P>
<P>8. Discussion: it is not clear where each trial was done. This should be noted in the table of Characteristics of included trials. Geographical differences may not only imply different epidemiology of rhinovirus infection, but also climatic and seasonal differences which could affect<BR/>outcomes. The two experimental studies by Tyrrell should not be lumped with the others.</P>
<P>9. Characteristics of included trials: At what stage in the infection, for how long, and how many times were the inhalations used in each trial? For some trials details are incomplete, e.g. Ophir: source of patients, length of follow up. Tyrrell-1 and -2: length of follow up.</P>
<P>10. Conclusions: I think the implications for practice need to be rethought in the light of a more detailed analysis.</P>

<P>In 1999 when we published the first review we searched MEDLINE using the following MeSH headings: common cold; rhinopharyngitis; inhalation; steam and heated vapour. We used the highly sensitive search strategy for identifying RCTs as given in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I>. We used different combinations of terms to retrieve the maximum number of studies. We searched EMBASE, Current Contents, review articles and cross-references. We wrote letters to the manufacturers of the rhinotherm equipment for any unpublished trials. We did not receive any replies.</P>
<P>In 2003, we updated this review to identify all recent RCTs in any language. We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (<I>The Cochrane Library </I>2003, Issue 4), which contains the Cochrane Acute Respiratory Infections Group's Specialised Register, MEDLINE (January 1966 to November Week 2, 2003), EMBASE (January 1990 to November 2003) and Current Contents (current five years).</P>
<P>In 2005, we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (<I>The Cochrane Library</I> 2005, Issue 4), which contains the Cochrane Acute Respiratory Infections Group's Specialised Register, MEDLINE (2003 to December Week 2, 2005); EMBASE (July 2003 to September 2005) and Current Contents (current five years). No new trials were identified.</P>
<P>In the 2010 update we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (<I>The Cochrane Library</I> 2010, Issue 3), which contains the Cochrane Acute Respiratory Infections Group's Specialised Register, MEDLINE (December 2005 to July week 1, 2010), EMBASE.com (September 2005 to July 2010) and Current Contents (2005 to July 2010). We used the following search terms to search MEDLINE and CENTRAL. We combined the MEDLINE search with the Cochrane Highly Sensitive Search Strategy for identifying randomised trials in MEDLINE.</P>
