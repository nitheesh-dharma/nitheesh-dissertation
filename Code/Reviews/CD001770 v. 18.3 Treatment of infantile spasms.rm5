<P>The optimum treatment for infantile spasms has yet to be proven with confidence, in part because of the different aims of existing studies. However, some useful conclusions can be drawn from current evidence.</P>
<P>Infantile spasms is a rare seizure disorder commonly associated with severe learning difficulties. Many different treatments are currently used worldwide in the treatment of this disorder, and many more have been tried in the past, often with little success. Not all treatments are licensed for use in all countries. Most treatments are associated with significant adverse effects. Additional research is needed to explore the long-term benefits of different therapies for seizure control and for neurodevelopment. Two studies have shown that a placebo is not as good as an active treatment in resolving the spasms. The strongest evidence suggests that hormonal treatment (prednisolone or tetracosactide depot) leads to resolution of spasms faster and in more infants than does vigabatrin. Responses without subsequent relapse may be no different, but one study suggested that hormonal treatment (prednisolone or tetracosactide) might improve long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes in infants and young children for whom no underlying cause for their infantile spasms has been identified. This makes hormonal treatment more attractive, at least for this group of infants. More information and further research are needed to compare currently available therapies.</P>

<P>Infantile spasms (West's Syndrome) is a syndrome that includes a peculiar type of epileptic seizure&#8212;the spasms&#8212;and an electroencephalographic (EEG) abnormality often called <I>hypsarrhythmia</I>. Psychomotor retardation is frequently found at follow-up. Approximately two-thirds of affected infants will have a detectable underlying neurological abnormality, but still little is known about the pathophysiological basis for infantile spasms, and treatment remains problematic.<BR/>
</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To compare the effects of single pharmaceutical therapies used to treat infantile spasms in terms of control of the spasms, resolution of the EEG, relapse rates, psychomotor development, subsequent epilepsy, side effects, and mortality.</P>

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2013-02-26 10:27:55 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>To identify published data, we searched the Cochrane Epilepsy Group Specialised Register (October 2012), CENTRAL (<I>The Cochrane Library</I> 2012, Issue 9), MEDLINE (1946 to September Week 4, 2012), EMBASE (1980 to March 2003), and the reference lists of all retrieved articles.<BR/>To identify unpublished data, we searched the ISRCTN Register (www.controlled-trials.com), corresponded with colleagues and drug companies, and made requests at international conferences.</P>

<P>All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of the administration of drug therapy to patients with infantile spasms.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-02-26 10:33:26 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We found 16 small RCTs (fewer than 100 patients enrolled) and 2 larger RCTs (more than 100 patients enrolled). These 18 studies looked at a total of 916 patients treated with a total of 12 different pharmaceutical agents. Overall methodology of the studies was poor, in part because of ethical dilemmas such as giving placebo injections to children. Two studies showed that placebo was not as good as active treatment in resolving the spasms. The strongest evidence suggested that hormonal treatment (prednisolone or tetracosactide depot) leads to resolution of spasms faster and in more infants than does vigabatrin. Responses without subsequent relapse may be no different. The same study suggests that hormonal treatments might improve the long-term developmental outcome compared with vigabatrin in infants not found to have an underlying cause for their infantile spasms.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2013-02-26 10:34:08 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>To date, few well-designed RCTs have considered the treatment of infantile spasms, and the numbers of patients enrolled have been small. In the majority, methodology has been poor, hence it is not clear which treatment is optimal in the treatment of this epilepsy syndrome. Hormonal treatment resolves spasms in more infants than vigabatrin, but this may or may not translate into better long-term outcomes. If prednisolone or vigabatrin is used, high dosage is recommended. Vigabatrin may be the treatment of choice in tuberous sclerosis. Resolution of the EEG features may be important, but this has not been proven. Further research using large studies with robust methodology is required.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2013-04-03 11:41:57 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Infantile spasms, also known as West's syndrome or salaam spasms, were first described by Dr West in a letter he wrote to <I>The Lancet</I> in 1841. It is a syndrome that includes a peculiar type of seizure, high risk of psychomotor retardation, and usually a characteristic electroencephalographic (EEG) pattern known as <I>hypsarrhythmia</I> (<LINK REF="REF-ILAE-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">ILAE 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Roger-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roger 1985</LINK>). It is relatively uncommon, with an estimated incidence of 0.16 to 0.42 per 1000 live births (<LINK REF="REF-Cowan-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cowan 1991</LINK>). An association with several disorders has been noted, some of which are known at disease onset (e.g. cerebral palsy, Down syndrome), although others (e.g. tuberous sclerosis, neuronal migration disorders) are discovered on investigation after the onset of spasms. However, in a significant minority of cases, the aetiology remains unknown (<LINK REF="REF-Aicardi-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aicardi 1994</LINK>). Despite awareness of the condition for over 150 years, little progress has been made in our understanding of the pathophysiology of the condition, and treatment of the disorder remained largely empirical for a long time.</P>
<P>Onset of seizures usually occurs within the first year of life, with a peak age of onset of three to five months. The seizures usually consist of sudden, generally bilateral, and symmetrical contractions of the neck, trunk, and extremities that are associated with a brief loss of consciousness. Less commonly, they may consist of an extensor spasm of the legs and spine, or simple head nodding. Rarely they are asymmetrical. Seizures often occur in clusters or runs; commonly 20 or so but as many as 100 spasms can occur in a single cluster, with each individual spasm lasting 1 to 2 seconds only. These clusters frequently occur as the infant is waking from sleep and are commonly associated with a cry. In most cases, they resolve by the age of three, although rarely they can persist up to 10 to 15 years of age (<LINK REF="REF-Aicardi-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aicardi 1994</LINK>).</P>
<P>Hypsarrhythmia is used to describe an EEG pattern that is characterized by random, high-voltage spikes and slow waves. The most striking features of hypsarrhythmia are high-voltage slow waves with variable amplitude; spikes and waves from many foci, varying with time; and lack of synchrony, with a generally 'chaotic' appearance. The typical appearance is more likely to be noted in earlier stages of infantile spasms and when onset occurs at a younger age. The hypsarrhythmic pattern may disappear during rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep, but it may be observed with greater sensitivity in some other stages of sleep (<LINK REF="REF-Lux-2004b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lux 2004b</LINK>).</P>
<P>The seizures are refractory to treatment with most conventional antiepileptic drugs. Although the spasms resolve with time, the long-term prognosis is poor. Many children develop other forms of severe epilepsy, and most (80% to 90%) have psychomotor retardation (<LINK REF="REF-Riikonen-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Riikonen 1996</LINK>). Some children have delayed development before the onset of their seizures as part of a predisposing condition, for example, Down syndrome. Nevertheless, even in these patients, further regression of development is often seen after the onset of spasms. The degree of psychomotor delay is severe in approximately 70% of children, placing a great burden on both caregivers and the health system. Although few studies have been undertaken to look at long-term outcomes for these patients, it is a widely accepted view that earlier diagnosis, along with quicker control of the spasms, might improve the prognosis. Evidence now supports this, in that a longer lead time to treatment (time from onset to start of treatment) leads to a worse developmental outcome (<LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Callaghan-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Callaghan 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>In the past, numerous clinical trials have investigated different treatment regimens. The main problem is that few of these trials were randomised controlled trials, and the drug under investigation has frequently been used long after the onset of seizures and in addition to, or after, other anticonvulsants. Wide variation in the drug dosages used and in the duration of their use has been reported. As a result, it is confusing when looking at the literature to know which is the best treatment for this disorder, with the consequence that many different treatment modalities have been used. Most trials have considered infantile spasms as a single entity rather than considering the underlying aetiology, but it is possible that infantile spasms resulting from one particular disorder (e.g. Down syndrome, tuberous sclerosis) might respond better to one form of treatment than another. Other factors than treatment that might affect the outcome also need to be considered, for example, the belief that the sooner the spasms are brought under control (i.e. the shorter the lead time), the better the outcome. Likewise, if infants entered into a trial have been previously treated for infantile spasms, this might also affect outcome. Recently, it has been suggested that age at onset affects developmental outcome, with improvement noted for each increase in age of one month (<LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Callaghan-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Callaghan 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>Infantile spasms are an unusual epilepsy syndrome. The interictal EEG is very abnormal in these infants, but occasionally it is abnormal only during sleep. The ictal EEG is variable, often with suppression or fast activity, but the ictal event is frequently (but not always) typical. Agreement on the exact definition of the EEG abnormality required to make the diagnosis has not been achieved, but fortunately, the combination of the unusual ictal event, the clinical semiology, and the very abnormal EEG makes any other diagnosis unlikely, even when either the EEG or the ictal event is not typical.</P>
<P>The fact that ictal episodes are individually very brief (lasting between one and two seconds), their occurrence in clusters or batches (many of which can occur in a day), and the frequency of the ictal episodes during a cluster (often many per cluster) are features also contributing to the fact that this is an unusual epilepsy. Absence of ictal activity can, therefore, be detected with some accuracy (depending on the accuracy of the witness) on a daily basis by direct observation. Cessation of all ictal activity is generally accompanied by resolution of the features usually seen on the EEG, but many infants will not then have a normal EEG because of other seizure types or underlying structural brain abnormalities. It is not practical to record the EEG on a daily basis; therefore, the relationship between resolution of ictal activity and improvement of the EEG is not clearly established. Therefore, disagreement continues over the importance of continuing treatment if the EEG remains severely abnormal in the absence of clinical evidence of continuing infantile spasms. Some clinicians believe that persistence of the EEG abnormality must indicate continuation of the epileptic encephalopathy, and that the EEG findings should, therefore, be treated even in the absence of observed ictal episodes.</P>
<P>Another unusual feature of this condition is the developmental regression that so often accompanies, or quickly follows, the onset of seizures. This, along with the severity of the EEG abnormality, has led many to the conclusion that infantile spasms are an epileptic encephalopathy. This theory lends support to the hypothesis that it may be important to continue treatment until the EEG abnormalities have improved. Most treatments are believed to work if a response occurs within a short time of the commencement of treatment, usually within 14 days. Such claims need to be backed up with evidence, especially since because the tendency in the literature is for claims of rapid response not to be supported by the evidence. However, the practical outcome of the developmental regression and the usual rapid response (viz other epilepsy syndromes) mean that continuation of spasms beyond 14 days of treatment is usually an indication that one should try an alternative treatment.</P>
<P>These issues, definitions, and outcomes have been subject to review by an independent group using Delphi methodology. This review concluded that clinical evidence of cessation of spasms should be reported independently of cessation of spasms combined with resolution of the EEG features of the condition. It was agreed that subsequent developmental progress was an important outcome, and that this might be a more important outcome than cessation of spasms. It is proposed that the protocol for the present review will need to be reviewed before the next review, if one is to take into account this internationally agreed consensus.</P>
<P>Additional difficulties have arisen from the use of terms such as 'high dose' and 'low dose' in publications. In some studies, the 'high dose' has been lower than the dose used in other studies as the 'low dose.' In addition, lack of study by pharmaceutical companies, a common problem in paediatric practice, means that the most effective dose often is not known. Some studies have corrected for body size through an adjustment for body weight; others have adjusted for surface area. However, such adjustment is not usually justified, and the scientific basis for or against adjustment is not as robust as it could be.</P>
<P>Therefore, it is clear that resolution of the clinical evidence of spasms is one outcome, and that this may occur quickly, in contrast to most epilepsy syndromes. Resolution of the EEG features also needs to be reported, and subsequent developmental progress is an important later outcome. Other seizure types occur before the spasms in many infants and may follow spasms, even when these resolve and other seizure types did not occur before the onset of spasms; therefore, epilepsy outcomes for all seizure types need to be reported.</P>

<P>To compare the effects of single pharmaceutical therapies used to treat infantile spasms in terms of control of spasms, resolution of hypsarrhythmia, long-term psychomotor development, and subsequent epilepsy rates.</P>

<P>*Therapy A = ACTH** or hydrocortisone or prednisone or prednisolone or carbamazepine or ethosuximide or gabapentin or lamotrigine or phenobarbitone or phenytoin or topiramate or vigabatrin or valproate or clonazepam or diazepam or nitrazepam or pyridoxine (vitamin B6), or methysergide, or methylparatyrosine, or sulthiame, or any other single therapeutic agent studied in the literature.</P>
<P>**ACTH &#8211; at the time this review was undertaken, two ACTH preparations were in widespread use: ACTH (adrenocorticotrophin hormone) and tetracosactide. ACTH is naturally occurring, and the therapeutic product is derived from a bovine or porcine source and is administered as an intramuscular injection. However in the UK, with existing concerns surrounding bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), ACTH has been withdrawn from the market. Tetracosactide is a synthetic alternative to ACTH and consists of the first 24 amino acids occurring in ACTH. It displays the same physiological properties as ACTH. It can be provided in depot and non-depot preparations' the Depot preparation is usually given on alternate days.</P>

<P>This was measured as the number of spasms occurring before treatment was commenced compared with the number occurring after treatment and was to be measured as a dichotomous variable (i.e. greater than 50% reduction or less than 50% reduction in the number of spasms occurring per day over the seven-day period before trial entry and over a seven-day period at one month after the start of therapy).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(3) Resolution of EEG abnormality</HEADING>
<P>Participants were divided into those in whom the EEG abnormality remained and those in whom there was resolution. This was measured as a dichotomous variable (i.e. resolved or unresolved).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(4) Relapse rates of spasms</HEADING>
<P>A single spasm occurring by one year of age or within the study period but after cessation of spasms constituted a relapse. It was measured as a dichotomous variable (i.e. relapse occurred or no relapse occurred). Time taken from cessation of spasms to relapse was also to be measured as a continuous variable (measured in days) in those patients in whom spasms had ceased.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(5) Long-term psychomotor development</HEADING>
<P>This was to be analysed in months as a measure of deviation from the chronological age. It was to be measured at three months post entry into the trial and, where possible, at five years of age. It was measured as a continuous variable.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(6) Subsequent epilepsy rates</HEADING>
<P>The diagnosis of any epileptic seizure type other than infantile spasms after commencement of therapy constituted subsequent epilepsy. This was to be measured at three months post entry into the trial and, where possible, at five years of age. Any seizure type plus each seizure type (e.g. primary generalised, partial) was to be measured as a dichotomous variable (i.e. present or absent) over the previous one month at three months post entry, and over the previous six months at five years of age.<BR/>We used the original authors' diagnosis because of the difficulty involved in defining epileptic seizures in children.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(7) Adverse effects</HEADING>
<P>Only side effects that were considered severe enough to warrant discontinuation of the test treatment were measured. They were measured as a dichotomous variable (i.e. therapy stopped vs therapy not stopped). They were also qualitatively summarised.</P>

<P>The literature search identified 96 studies to be evaluated for inclusion in this review. Some studies were identified from more than one source. Review of the studies eliminated 64 studies because they were not RCTs and a further six because the participants did not suffer from infantile spasms; one paper was excluded because the data referred to the effects of hormonal treatment on the brain when imaged using computerised tomography and did not report any other outcome measure. This left a total of 27 papers reporting 18 different RCTs conducted to look at the treatment of infantile spasms, yielding a total of 858 patients. These 18 trials looked at 12 different pharmacological agents: vigabatrin; ACTH (nine different treatment regimens and different preparations); prednisolone; prednisone; hydrocortisone; magnesium sulphate; nitrazepam; sodium valproate; sulthiame; flunarizine; ganaxolone methysergide; and alpha-methylparatyrosine (<I>see</I> table <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK> and <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>, <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>, <LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK>, <LINK REF="TBL-04" TYPE="TABLE">Table 4</LINK>).

<LINK REF="STD-Appleton-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Appleton 1999</LINK>
<BR/>This was a short-term, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled multicentre trial of 40 participants. Inclusion criteria included participants between 1 and 20 months of age with newly diagnosed and previously untreated infantile spasms in whom the EEG demonstrated classical or modified hypsarrhythmia. A spasm was defined as a sudden, generally bilateral and symmetrical contraction of the muscles of the neck, trunk, and extremities (flexor, extensor, or mixed). The principal exclusion criterion was the use of any medication, including steroids, that could be considered to be an anti-epileptic drug within a two-month period before entry into the trial. The trial consisted of a five-day double-blind phase, during which patients received vigabatrin or placebo. Twenty participants received vigabatrin and 20 received placebo. The initial starting dose was 50 mg/kg/day for 24 hours; if spasms did not cease completely, the dose was increased to 100 mg/kg/day, and this dose was maintained for a further 48 hours. The dose could then be increased further to 150 mg/kg/day. Randomisation was pre-determined by a code held by the pharmacy department for each participating hospital. Both recipients and assessors were blinded. Outcomes reported were cessation of spasms, reduction in spasms, resolution of hypsarrhythmia, and relapse rates. Some patients were lost to follow-up, but not during the double-blind phase.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Askalan-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Askalan 2003</LINK>
<BR/>This was an open-label, randomised, single-centred trial of nine participants. Inclusion criteria included participants between 3 and 16 months of age who presented with infantile spasms. The diagnosis of infantile spasms was confirmed by the presence of myoclonic flexor spasms, extensor spasms, or both, with video-EEG showing hypsarrhythmia or modified hypsarrhythmia. Individuals were excluded if they had previously received vigabatrin or corticosteroids; had a known visual disturbance; or had a known medical condition for which corticosteroids would be contraindicated. The trial consisted of three participants receiving 150 IU/m<SUP>2</SUP>/day ACTH intramuscularly in two divided doses for one week, followed by 75 IU/m<SUP>2</SUP>/day ACTH for one week; and six participants receiving 100 mg/kg/day vigabatrin orally in two divided doses for two days, then increasing to 150 mg/kg/day for the remainder of the two-week period. After the initial two-week period, responders remained on their initial trial treatment and completed either a 12-week tapering protocol for ACTH or 18 months of vigabatrin. Non-responders were crossed over to the alternate trial drug while being tapered off the original study drug over one week. The method of randomisation was not stated. Assessors interpreting the EEGs and psychologists were blinded. Outcomes reported were cessation of spasms, resolution of hypsarrhythmia, short-term cognitive outcomes, language scores, and the evolution of epilepsy and autism.</P>

The trial consisted of a two-week period during which 15 participants were treated with ACTH 150 units/m<SUP>2</SUP>/day intramuscularly in two divided doses; and 14 participants were treated with prednisone 2 mg/kg/day given orally in two divided doses. A computer-generated random number list determined treatment, and allocation was concealed (as confirmed by Dr Baram, direct correspondence).

Participants were excluded if they had been previously treated with steroids or vigabatrin but not with other anticonvulsant medications. The trial spanned a one-month period, during which 11 infants received vigabatrin at a dose of 150 mg/kg/day, and 11 infants received hydrocortisone at a dose of 15 mg/kg/day.

<BR/>This was a randomised, double-blind, multicentre trial of 51 participants. Inclusion criteria included children between 3 and 18 months of age with newly diagnosed infantile spasms. The diagnosis was confirmed by the presence of hypsarrhythmia or hemi-hypsarrhythmia on an EEG that had to contain periods of sleep and wakefulness. Participants were excluded if they had a history of epilepsy before the development of infantile spasms, unless they were not treated or had been treated with phenytoin or phenobarbitone; or if they had other ongoing or acute diseases. The trial consisted of a nine-day (days one to nine) treatment period with pyridoxine for all participants. On days one to three, all participants received just pyridoxine. From day four of the trial, 28 participants received sulthiame at 5 mg/kg/day in two divided doses, and 23 participants received placebo. If no response was seen after three days, the dose of the trial drug was doubled for three days. Randomisation was concealed by sealed envelopes (personal communication). The recipients were blinded, but the assessors were not blinded to treatment allocation. Outcomes reported were cessation of spasms, resolution of hypsarrhythmia, and relapse rates.</P>

Inclusion criteria included participants between 1 and 24 months of age with infantile spasms documented by a hypsarrhythmic or a modified hypsarrhythmic pattern on EEG. None of the participants had received steroids or nitrazepam before entry into the trial. The trial consisted of a four-week period during which 27 participants received nitrazepam, and 25 participants ACTH. Nitrazepam was started at 0.2 mg/kg/day in two divided doses or at 1 mg twice daily, whichever was greater, and was adjusted twice weekly by increments of 0.3 to 0.4 mg/kg/day. Maintenance dosage ranged from 4.8 to 9 mg/day. ACTH was given as a once-daily intramuscular injection of 40 units. A computer-generated randomisation code determined treatment, but concealment of allocation was not clearly stated. Recipients were not blinded, but blinded assessment of outcome was performed. The only outcome reported was reduction in spasm frequency. A discrepancy between the review authors was noted over the assessment of how many participants were lost to follow-up in this trial; this discrepancy arose because the authors were unclear in their paper as to how many participants were lost to follow-up. We have been unable to contact the author to clarify this point, so the number of participants lost to follow-up remains unclear.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Elterman-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Elterman 2010</LINK>
<BR/>This was a randomised, multicentre trial of 221 participants. Inclusion criteria included participants younger than two years of age but weighing at least 3.5 kg. Diagnostic criteria included infantile spasms and an EEG pattern typical of hypsarrhythmia or modified hypsarrhythmia, or multifocal spike wave discharges, or a video-EEG recording capturing an event confirming the diagnosis of infantile spasms electroencephalographically. Participants were receiving stable doses of antiepilepsy medication, if applicable, and were unresponsive to a 50-mg bolus of pyridoxine, when appropriate. Participants were excluded if they had received an investigational drug within 30 days of enrolment (one-week washout for ganaxolone): and had been or were currently taking corticosteroids (brief exposure to low-dose corticosteroids for inflammatory conditions or replacement therapy was acceptable but required a one-week washout), valproic acid; or felbamate within 60 days of enrolment; or were receiving more than two standard antiepilepsy drugs to treat non&#8211;infantile spasm seizures. Participants were also excluded if they had a treatable or progressive cause of seizures; had current active medical disorders; had a caregiver who was unable to reliably record seizures or recall adverse events; or had showed poor compliance with medication. The trial consisted of a two-week period during which participants received low-dose vigabatrin 18 to 36 mg/kg/day or high-dose vigabatrin 100 to 148 mg/kg/day. The dose was based on the participant's weight and, in the high-dose group, was titrated over the first seven days of the study. Medication was given twice daily unless the total dose was less than 250 mg per day, in which case daily dosing was permitted. Participants in either group who continued to have infantile spasms after seven days of the full dose of vigabatrin specified for their weight could have the dose increased weekly by 25 to 50 mg/kg/day to a maximum dose of 200 mg/kg/day. The method of randomisation was not stated. The authors stated that this was a single-blinded study, and that the recipients were blinded but the assessors were not. However, the recipients were not blinded to the dose of vigabatrin given (it was supplied as 500-mg tablets in open-labelled bottles), and caregivers were simply 'masked' as to whether their children were assigned to the high-dose or the low-dose group. Outcomes reported were cessation of spasms;resolution of hypsarrhythmia;time to cessation of spasms; and relapse rates. Safety data were also published. A total of 221 participants were randomly assigned: all were followed up as intention to treat, none were lost to follow-up.</P>

Inclusion criteria included participants with infantile spasms and hypsarrhythmic EEG patterns on serial 24-hour video and polygraphic monitoring. No participant had been previously treated with steroids, but some had received other anticonvulsant medications. Twelve participants received ACTH 20 to 30 units/day for two weeks, which was then tapered over one week if a response was seen. If a response was not seen, participants continued a further four weeks before the dose was tapered. These participants also received a prednisone placebo. Twelve participants received prednisone, 2 mg/kg/day for two weeks, which was then tapered over one week if a response was seen. If a response was not seen, they continued a further four weeks before the dose was tapered. These participants also received an ACTH gel placebo. The method of randomisation was not given. Recipients were not blinded, but it was unclear if blinded assessment of outcome was performed. Outcomes reported were complete cessation of spasms and relapse rates.</P>

Exclusion criteria included a diagnosis or high risk of tuberous sclerosis; previous treatment with or a contraindication to vigabatrin or hormonal treatments; a lethal or potentially lethal disorder other than infantile spasms; inability of parents or guardians to give informed, signed consent or to know when spasms stop; leaving the UK unexpectedly within one month of randomisation; enrolment in a concurrent trial that either used treatment that might affect the outcome measures or was labour-intensive for participants, guardians, or medical practitioners. Fifty-two participants received vigabatrin given orally in two divided doses: 50 mg/kg/day for the first two doses, increasing to 100 mg/kg/day and then to 150 mg/kg/day at 96 hours if no response was seen. Twenty-five participants received tetracosactide depot given intramuscularly, 0.5 mg (40 IU) on alternate days for two weeks, and increased to 0.75 mg (60 IU) on alternate days if no response was seen after one week. Thirty participants received prednisolone given orally, 10 mg four times daily for two weeks, increasing to 20 mg three times a day after one week if no response was seen. Randomisation was concealed by sealed envelopes. Neither recipients nor assessors were blinded. Outcomes reported were cessation of spasms and resolution of hypsarrhythmia, relapse rates, development at 14 months of age, seizure rates at 14 months of age, development at 4 years of age, and seizure rates at 4 years of age.

<P>This was a study in which flunarizine or placebo was administered as an add-on drug to vigabatrin to 68 infants aged 3 to 18 months, with new onset of infantile spasms in a double-blind, randomised, controlled trial. Infants were included if they had 'de novo' onset of infantile spasms and an EEG with hypsarrhythmia or modified hypsarrhythmia Children were excluded if they had a known neurometabolic or neurodegenerative disease at study entry or a pre-existing medical condition contraindicating steroid treatment, if they could not obtain the neuropsychological evaluation before enrolment, or if families were unable to comply with follow-up visits.All children received vigabatrin 100 mg/kg/day for 3 days followed by 150 mg/kg/day when spasms persisted, as first-line treatment. Responders continued to take vigabatrin for 6 months. If after 2 weeks, vigabatrin failed to arrest clinical spasms and abolish hypsarrhythmia, children were switched to synthetic adrenocorticotropic hormone (sACTH) given intramuscularly, and vigabatrin was tapered over a week. The dose of sACTH given every 2 days was calculated to be equivalent to 150 IU of natural ACTH/m<SUP>2</SUP>/day for 2 weeks, followed by a 10-week tapering schedule. If clinical spasms and/or hypsarrhythmia persisted after 2 weeks of treatment with sACTH,the children were switched to topiramate (10 mg/kg/day).Outcome was reported as development at 24 months of age using the Vineland Adaptive Behaviour Scale and the Bayley Scales of Infant Development.

Outcomes reported were cessation of spasms, resolution of hypsarrhythmia, and short-term effects on subsequent epilepsy rates and cognitive function.</P>

<BR/>This was a randomised single-centre trial of 26 participants. Inclusion criteria included participants with infantile spasms and hypsarrhythmia on video-EEG. Individuals were excluded if they had received previous steroid or intravenous gamma globulin treatment. Thirteen participants received 1 unit/kg/day of synthetic ACTH for two weeks, tapering over a further two weeks; and 13 participants received 0.2 units/kg/day of synthetic ACTH for two weeks, tapering over a further two weeks. The method of randomisation was not stated. It was not clear whether recipients and assessors were blinded. Outcomes reported were cessation of spasms, resolution of hypsarrhythmia, relapse rates, and the short-term effect on development. One participant was lost to follow-up.</P>

<P>This was a single-centre trial of 38 participants. Inclusion criteria included participants with infantile spasms and hypsarrhythmia. Exclusions included acute associated illness and previous treatment with ACTH, prednisolone, hydrocortisone, or magnesium sulphate. All participants received ACTH 25 units/day, and half received magnesium sulphate 0.25 g/kg/day for three weeks. Allocation was not concealed, but randomisation was applied. Recipients and outcomes were not blinded. Outcomes reported were cessation of spasms and resolution of hypsarrhythmia: some developmental outcome data were given, but no between group comparisons were done. No deaths occurred.</P>

<P>Overall, methodological quality of the included studies was poor. All but two of the studies had small numbers of participants&#8212;the largest included 221 and the second largest 107 participants. All the other studies enrolled fewer than 70 participants, and subsequently the power of most of the studies was low. There were five placebo-controlled trials (<LINK REF="STD-Appleton-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Appleton 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Debus-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Debus 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dyken-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Dyken 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bitton-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Bitton 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tsai-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Tsai 2009</LINK> ). One trial used a double-dummy technique (<LINK REF="STD-Hrachovy-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Hrachovy 1983</LINK>). Although all studies stated that they were RCTs, only six stated the method of randomisation, and only four indicated that concealment of allocation had been performed. Recipients were blinded in five studies; blinding did not take place in eight studies, and it was unclear whether blinding was performed in the remaining studies. Six studies clearly stated that those measuring outcomes were unaware of the assigned therapy. Six studies had losses to follow-up. Six studies were multicentre trials, and six recruited participants from a single centre; it was unclear how many centres were involved in recruiting participants in the remaining studies. Of the 18 RCTs considered in this review, all but two had a high risk of bias (<I>see</I> <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>: Methodological quality of included studies).</P>
<P>Also of importance for interpretation of the meta-analyses below, the results of longer-term outcomes were complicated by the fact that infants initially randomly assigned to receive one therapy were likely to have gone on to receive the comparative or other therapies, or both, within the follow-up period if they failed to respond to the first therapy.</P>

<P>However, it is important to note the following when assessing the results of this study.</P>
<UL>
<LI>This study was initially published in 2001. In the initial paper, many participants had been 'lost to follow-up' because they were excluded from the analysis for violating the protocol. However, in the final article, published in 2010, the authors report the findings on an intention-to-treat basis (now more widely accepted as best practise). This explains why the numbers presented in this updated review are different from those presented previously, with a lower rate of participants lost to follow-up.</LI>
<LI>In their original study, primary responders were defined as subjects who were spasm free and obtained a video-EEG within 3 days of the seventh day of spasm freedom, which showed no indication of spasms or hypsarrhythmia. During the course of the study, it became apparent that obtaining the video-EEG within 3 days of spasm cessation was not feasible for most subjects. A post hoc analysis was therefore performed, relaxing the timing of vidoe-EEG to any subsequent visit. This analysis yielded response rates of 33/107 in the high-dose group and 15/114 in the low-dose group (P = 0.0014).</LI>

<P>The <LINK REF="STD-Lux-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Lux 2004</LINK> study reported that Vineland Adaptive Behaviour Scales (VABS) were obtained in 101 of 102 survivors (Figure 1) at 14 months of age. This study reported that no significant differences were noted in mean composite scores between tetracosactide and high-dose prednisolone and vigabatrin (78.6 (SD 16.8) vs 77.5 (SD 12.7); difference 1.0, 95% CI -4.9 to 7.0; t99 = 0.35, P = 0.73). Mean composite scores were significantly higher in infants with no identified aetiology than in infants with a known aetiology (83.8 (SD 16.5) vs 73.3 (SD 11.4); difference 10.5, 95% CI 4.9 to 16.1; t97 = 3.74, P = 0.0003).

No significant differences in composite scores were noted between those with an interval between onset of spasms and treatment (lead time to treatment) of less than one month and those with an interval greater than one month (where this interval was known) for all infants (80.3 (SD 14.9) vs 76.1 (SD 15.1); difference 4.3, 95% CI -2.2 to 10.7; t89 = 1.32, P = 0.19) and for the subgroup with no identified underlying aetiology (87.4 (SD 16.2) vs 81.9 (SD 16.1); difference 5.5, 95% CI -5.1 to 16.1; t38 = 1.05, P = 0.30). Analysis of composite scores using ANOVA showed a significant interaction between treatment and underlying aetiology (F1,95 = 6.78, P = 0.011). For the subgroup of infants with no identified underlying aetiology, mean composite scores were higher in infants allocated hormone treatment than in those allocated vigabatrin (88.2 (SD 17.3) vs 78.9 (SD 14.3); difference 9.3, 95% CI 1.2 to 17.3; least significant difference test t95 = 2.28, P = 0.025). If the two infants whose aetiology was not fully investigated were added to the no identified aetiology group (the sensitivity analysis with the most extreme data against the detected effect), the interaction remained significant (F1,97 = 5.02, P = 0.027), but the difference between means was not significant (86.9 (SD 18.1) vs 79.5 (SD 14.3); difference 7.4, 95% CI -0.7 to 15.4; t97 = 1.82, P = 0.071). The mean composite scores in the group with an identified aetiology did not differ significantly between treatment groups (hormone 70.8 (SD 11.1) vs vigabatrin 75.9 (SD 11.3); difference 5.0, 95% CI -2.3 to 12.4; least significance difference test t95 = 1.36, P = 0.18).</P>
<P>The Lux study (<LINK REF="STD-Lux-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Lux 2004</LINK>) reported that VABS were obtained at four years of age in 77 infants of the original cohort. VABS scores for the 39 infants allocated hormonal treatment were 60 compared with 50 for the 38 infants allocated vigabatrin (Mann-Whitney U = 575; P = .091; median difference 8 (95%CI -1 to 19). For those with no identified aetiology, VABS scores were 96 for the 21 infants allocated hormonal treatment compared with 63 for the 16 allocated vigabatrin (Mann Whitney U = 98.5; P = 0.033; median difference 14, 95% CI 1 to 42. VABS scores for those with proven aetiology were 45 for the 18 infants allocated hormonal treatment compared with 50 for the 21 allocated vigabatrin (Mann-Whitney U = 179.5; P = 0.79; median difference -1, 95% CI -11 to 7).</P>
<P>The Vigevano report (<LINK REF="STD-Vigevano-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Vigevano 1997</LINK>) stated that there was no apparent difference in cognitive development between the two groups during follow-up, which ranged from 9 to 44 months.

<P>Effects on subsequent seizure rates:</P>
<P>The Askalan study (<LINK REF="STD-Askalan-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Askalan 2003</LINK>) stated that the ACTH responder and two of the vigabatrin responders subsequently developed epilepsy during the two-year follow-up period; no further information was available. The <LINK REF="STD-Lux-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Lux 2004</LINK> study (reported 2005) reported seizure rates at 14 months of age. They indicated that in the vigabatrin group, seven participants continued to have infantile spasms (no other seizures present) compared with six in the hormonal group. In the vigabatrin group, seven participants were free of spasms but had other seizures present, compared with 13 in the hormonal group; and five participants in the vigabatrin group had both infantile spasms and other seizures present compared with eight in the hormonal group. None of these comparisons were statistically significant. The Lux study (<LINK REF="STD-Lux-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Lux 2004</LINK>) also reported seizure rates at 4 years of age. They indicated that in the vigabatrin group, five participants continued to have infantile spasms, as did five participants in the hormonal group. All ten participants had seizures of other types. In addition, in the vigabatrin group, 16 participants were free of spasms but had other seizures present, compared with 12 in the hormonal group. None of these comparisons were statistically significant.</P>
<P>The Vigevano study (<LINK REF="STD-Vigevano-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Vigevano 1997</LINK>) found the incidence of other types of epileptic seizures to be 25% in both groups during follow-up at 9 to 44 months. No study considered subsequent epilepsy rates at five years of age. Combining these studies revealed that 27 of 81 participants receiving vigabatrin had seizures at follow-up compared with t33 of 77 participants receiving hormonal treatment, Peto OR ratio 0.69 (95% CI 0.36 to 1.32).</P>
<P>Side effects:</P>
<P>The Lux trial (<LINK REF="STD-Lux-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Lux 2004</LINK>) stopped vigabatrin in two participants because of drowsiness and vomiting; tetracosactide in one participant because of a rash; and high-dose prednisolone in one participant because of irritability, vomiting, and high blood pressure. In the Vigevano trial (<LINK REF="STD-Vigevano-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Vigevano 1997</LINK>), investigators stopped vigabatrin in one participant because of excessive irritability, and ACTH in one participant with no reason given.</P>
<P>Deaths:</P>
<P>The Lux study (<LINK REF="STD-Lux-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Lux 2004</LINK>) reported nine deaths during follow-up to four years of age; five occurred in the vigabatrin group and four in the hormonal group.

However, it is known that prednisone requires metabolism to convert it to the active form, prednisolone. It is now known that at birth, the newborn infant has poor capacity of HSD11B1 to reduce prednisone to prednisolone, and that this ability only slowly increases over the first six months of life. Hence, prednisone and prednisolone should not be considered equivalent treatments for infants, and it is likely that prednisone will not be as effective as prednisolone in the treatment of infantile spasms.</P>
<P>Effects on cessation of spasms:</P>
<P>Baram (<LINK REF="STD-Baram-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Baram 1996</LINK>) compared 15 participants treated with natural ACTH (150 units/m<SUP>2</SUP>/day) with 14 treated with prednisone (2 mg/kg/day), and showed ACTH to be superior to prednisone, with cessation of spasms in 13 of 15 participants and 4 of 14 participants, respectively. Hrachovy (<LINK REF="STD-Hrachovy-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Hrachovy 1983</LINK>) compared 12 participants treated with ACTH (20 to 30 units/day) with 12 participants treated with prednisone (2 mg/kg/day). In the initial phase of the trial, 5 of 12 participants treated with ACTH had complete cessation of spasms compared with 4 of 12 treated with prednisone. Combining these two studies revealed that ACTH stopped the spasms in 18 of 27 participants compared with prednisone in 8 of 26 participants (Peto OR 4.19, 95% CI 1.42 to 12.35).<BR/>Effects on time taken to achieve cessation:</P>
<P>In the Barram study (<LINK REF="STD-Baram-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Baram 1996</LINK>), on average, the 13 responders to ACTH took 3.2 days (range 1 to 7 days, median 2 days) to achieve complete cessation of spasms, and the 4 responders to prednisone took an average of 4 days (range 2 to 7 days, median 3.5 days; WMD -0.8, 95% CI -3.3 to 1.7).<BR/>Effects on reduction in the number of spasms were not reported as an outcome in these studies.<BR/>Effects on relapse rates:</P>
<P>In the Barram study (<LINK REF="STD-Baram-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Baram 1996</LINK>), 2 of the 13 participants who responded to ACTH relapsed, and none of the four responders to prednisone relapsed. In the Hrachovy trial (<LINK REF="STD-Hrachovy-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Hrachovy 1983</LINK>), three of the five participants who responded to ACTH relapsed, and one of the four responders to prednisone also relapsed.</P>
<P>Overall, for Barram (<LINK REF="STD-Baram-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Baram 1996</LINK>), 11 participants who responded to ACTH remained spasm free and the four responders to prednisone also remained spasm free. For Hrachovy (<LINK REF="STD-Hrachovy-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Hrachovy 1983</LINK>), two participants successfully treated with ACTH remained spasm free, and three successfully treated with prednisone also remained spasm free within the study period. The combined Peto OR for these two studies was 2.6 (95% CI 0.8 to 8.1).<BR/>Effects on time taken to relapse were not reported as an outcome in these studies.<BR/>Effects on resolution of EEG:</P>
<P>For Baram (<LINK REF="STD-Baram-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Baram 1996</LINK>), this study showed resolution of their EEG in 13 of 15 participants treated with ACTH compared with 4 of 14 participants treated with prednisone (Peto OR 10.10, 95% CI 2.36 to 43.19). For Hrachovy (<LINK REF="STD-Hrachovy-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Hrachovy 1983</LINK>), 5 of 12 participants treated with ACTH had resolution of their EEG, but this was not reported for the group treated with prednisone, and their results were not therefore included in the OR calculation.</P>
<P>Effects on psychomotor development were not reported as an outcome in these studies.<BR/>Effects on subsequent seizure rates:</P>
<P>In the Baram study (<LINK REF="STD-Baram-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Baram 1996</LINK>), investigators compared ACTH with prednisone and found that seven participants in both groups developed other seizure types over the period of follow-up, 2 to 48 months. They did not report subsequent epilepsy rates at five years of age.<BR/>Side effects were not reported in these studies.<BR/>Deaths were not reported in these studies.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">High-dose ACTH versus low-dose ACTH</HEADING>
<P>Three studies were included (<LINK REF="STD-Hrachovy-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Hrachovy 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yanagaki-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Yanagaki 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shu-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Shu 2009</LINK> ). Hrachovy and Shu used natural ACTH, and Yanagaki used synthetic ACTH. This made direct comparison difficult. Yanagaki stated that the dose equivalent of 1 IU of natural ACTH is 0.025 IU of synthetic ACTH. The calculation of the dose to be given also varied: some doses were calculated on body weight, some on surface area, and others were given a standard dose regardless of weight, height, or age. <B>The results must be interpreted with caution.</B>
</P>
<P>Effects on cessation of spasms: The Hrachovy study (<LINK REF="STD-Hrachovy-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Hrachovy 1994</LINK>) randomly assigned 30 participants to high-dose ACTH (150 units/m<SUP>2</SUP>/day for three weeks with a tapering dose over a further nine weeks), and 29 participants to low-dose ACTH (20 to 30 units/day for two to six weeks, tapering over one week). Of 30 participants treated with high-dose therapy, 13 had complete cessation of spasms, and of 29 participants treated with low-dose therapy, 14 had complete cessation of spasms. The Yanagaki trial (<LINK REF="STD-Yanagaki-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Yanagaki 1999</LINK>) randomly assigned 13 participants to receive 1 unit /kg/day (equivalent to 40 units/kg/day of natural ACTH) for two weeks, tapering over a further two weeks, and 13 participants to receive 0.2 units/kg/day (equivalent to 8 units/kg/day of natural ACTH) for two weeks, tapering over a further two weeks. Among those treated with high-dose ACTH, spasm cessation occurred in 11 of 13 participants compared with 9 of 13 participants treated with low-dose ACTH. Combining these two studies revealed that high-dose ACTH stopped the spasms in 79.5% participants compared with 76.5% of participants with low-dose ACTH (Peto OR 1.1, 95% CI 0.4 to 2.6). The Shu study (<LINK REF="STD-Shu-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Shu 2009</LINK>) randomly assigned 30 children to receive either conventional-dose (high-dose) ACTH of 50 IU/day for 2 weeks, then tapered off to zero over 2 weeks, or low-dose ACTH of 0.4 IU/kg/day for 2 weeks, increased to 1 IU/kg /day if no response was seen, and then tapered to zero over 2 weeks. Investigators report that 53% of the high-dose group had a "good initial response" compared with 60% of participants in the low-dose group.<BR/>Effects on time taken to achieve cessation of spasms were not reported as an outcome in these studies.<BR/>Effects on reduction in the number of spasms were not considered as an outcome in these studies.<BR/>Effects on relapse rates: In the Hrachovy study (<LINK REF="STD-Hrachovy-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Hrachovy 1994</LINK>), 2 of the 13 participants who responded to high-dose ACTH relapsed, and 2 of the 14 participants who responded to low-dose ACTH also relapsed. In the Yanagaki study (<LINK REF="STD-Yanagaki-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Yanagaki 1999</LINK>), 3 of the 11 participants who responded to high-dose ACTH relapsed, and three of the nine responders to low-dose ACTH relapsed.

In the Yanagaki study (<LINK REF="STD-Yanagaki-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Yanagaki 1999</LINK>), eight participants who responded to high-dose ACTH remained spasm free and six participants who responded to low-dose ACTH remained spasm free.

Investigators found no significant differences in developmental quotients between the two groups at the end of the follow-up period.

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2013-04-30 15:36:58 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Infantile spasms were first described in 1841 in a letter that Dr West wrote to <I>The Lancet</I>. Since that time, at least 30 drugs have been tried and reported in the literature, but treatment remains problematic because of the variable availability of treatments, adverse reactions, incomplete response rates, and the long-term prognosis, which remains poor for both psychomotor development and subsequent development of other seizure types.</P>
<P>Despite the wealth of literature on this subject, most studies have been open prospective or retrospective trials. Most of the RCTs that have been undertaken include only small numbers of participants, with the result that individually, they have little power. In addition, studies have used widely varying treatments, dosage regimens, and outcome measures, making meta-analysis difficult to perform. We found no RCTs comparing therapies such as pyridoxine that are first-line therapies in some countries, including Japan. Some therapies (e.g. gamma-globulins, pyridoxine, lamotrigine, topiramate) have been described in case reports or in uncontrolled trials. In addition, many different preparations have been used. This is due in part to the availability of different compounds in different countries. In Europe and Japan, synthetic ACTH may be available, whilst in the United States, natural ACTH derivatives have been used until recently, when costs made them less attractive. Vigabatrin was not licensed for use in the United States or in Japan until recently. ACTH can be given only as an injection (intramuscularly, intravenously, or into the peritoneal cavity). Infants find injections distressing, and many centres use oral preparations (usually prednisolone) in preference: The use of prednisone probably should not be recommended. This makes analysis of the efficacy of individual 'steroid' preparations difficult.</P>
<P>Despite an extensive literature search, we found only 18 RCTs, and the overall reported methodology was poor. Only two studies had considered the number of participants required to determine whether one treatment was more efficacious than another. One study based its calculations on the assumption that the trial drug would be 50% more efficacious than the comparator drug in stopping the spasms (this trial did not find such a difference). The other study based its calculations on the assumption that 250 infants would be required to give 90% power for finding a 20% difference between the two treatment groups. Investigators were able to recruit 107 infants, giving nearly 80% power to see the reported difference of 23%.</P>
<P>Although all studies claimed to be randomised, less than half stated how randomisation had been performed, and only four studies reported adequate concealment of randomisation. Ideally, to minimise performance bias, trials should be double-blinded, although perhaps it is not surprising that only four such trials have been performed. Blinding recipients (or parents) and staff administering the therapies remains problematic. ACTH can be given only by intramuscular injection, but the other drugs used in the included RCTs are administered orally; nowadays, it is generally considered to be unethical to administer placebo intramuscular injections to young infants. In addition, many of the side effects of steroids, for example, weight gain and hypertension, are common and are easily recognised, making blinding difficult.</P>
<P>Some would argue that it is now proved that spasms are causally linked to the development of severe learning difficulties. Thus delaying treatment for long or administering a placebo would now be considered unethical. Finally, six studies stated that they had lost participants to follow-up. Not all remaining studies clearly stated that all participants entered into the trials had been successfully followed up for the duration of the study. We had planned to look for possible sources of clinical heterogeneity between studies, for example, sex, age at spasm onset, age at trial entry, and delay to treatment, and whether or not participants had received previous treatment. Unfortunately, this information often was not available, and complex analysis would have been required for any conclusions to be drawn. However, it is possible that some of these sources of heterogeneity are important in determining the outcome. For example, researchers in the Baram study (<LINK REF="STD-Baram-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Baram 1996</LINK>) found ACTH to be more efficacious than prednisone but had three times as many girls as boys in the ACTH group and roughly equal numbers in the prednisone group. It is possible, therefore, that if girls have a better outcome than boys, this may have contributed to the differences in response noted between the two groups.</P>
<P>When developing our protocol, we tried to provide definitions for terms such as <I>infantile spasms</I>, <I>cessation of spasms</I>, <I>relapse</I>, and so forth. We had planned to establish whether different definitions used by authors for infantile spasms might affect which participants would be included in a trial, thereby affecting outcomes. It became clear from our review of the literature that few authors had clearly defined the term <I>infantile spasms</I>. It was clear that some trials using entry criteria that defined the need for hypsarrhythmia in fact entered infants who did not meet this criterion. Some of these issues have now been considered by an expert group using Delphi methodology to avoid bias (<LINK REF="REF-Lux-2004b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lux 2004b</LINK>). No consensus was obtained on a definition of hypsarrhythmia, but other recommendations will be incorporated in our next update. This will require a revised protocol.<BR/>
<BR/>Inclusion and exclusion criteria varied, and some studies excluded infants with other seizure types. This is likely to have an impact on the outcome. For the purpose of this review, we accepted that any RCT stating that its participants had infantile spasms would be included, whether or not other seizure types were included.</P>
<P>The exact relationship between clinical spasms and typical or even modified (or atypical) hypsarrhythmia on the EEG is not clear. Not all infants with clinical evidence of infantile spasms are reported to have hypsarrhythmia. For those in whom it is present, it is not always present all of the time. It is not known whether the presence or absence of hypsarrhythmia affects long-term outcomes. Again, we had hoped that collecting and combining data from studies might help clarify these areas of uncertainty. Unfortunately, few studies provided sufficient data to allow any conclusions to be drawn. Neither will meta-analysis be reliable until hypsarrhythmia is reliably defined.</P>
<P>Infantile spasms are associated with a poor long-term prognosis. Most affected infants will also have severe learning difficulties, with high cost implications not only for patients and their families and their quality of life, but also for health services. Therefore, if any single treatment was shown to improve long-term psychomotor development and to reduce the risk of development of further seizure types, it would probably be considered to be more efficacious than other treatments, regardless of its effect on the spasms themselves or on EEG features. Although with time the spasms will resolve, many patients continue to have other forms of epilepsy into adult life, and about one-fifth will progress to Lennox Gastaut syndrome (<LINK REF="REF-Beaumanoir-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beaumanoir 1992</LINK>). Therefore, these patients will require anticonvulsants and will continue to suffer the effects of epilepsy, often for life. Very little information on developmental outcome is available; the most important information has come from the Lux studies (<LINK REF="STD-Lux-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Lux 2004</LINK>, 2005). This suggests that early control of spasms might improve development in those with no proven underlying aetiology, but the finding is not robust and longer-term follow-up is awaited. The effect of time from onset of spasms to the start of treatment has not been reported, except in Lux 2005, in which no difference between less than one month and longer than one month was reported. Little information is available on subsequent seizure rates, but the literature suggests that this may not be influenced by treatment.</P>
<P>The spasms themselves are certainly distressing for parents and for caregivers. It is possible that they are also distressing for the infant, as many cry immediately following a spasm or appear to be in pain and distressed. The long-term benefits of different therapies remain uncertain, and more research on this topic is needed. Two studies have shown that placebo is not as good as active treatment in resolving the spasms. The strongest evidence we found suggests that hormonal treatment leads to resolution of spasms faster and in more infants than treatment with vigabatrin. Response without subsequent relapse may be no different, but if child development might be better after hormonal treatment, this might make hormonal treatments more attractive. More information and further research are required. We found no other RCTs comparing other forms of therapies, such as sodium valproate, benzodiazepines, pyridoxine, or phenobarbitone, in terms of cessation of spasms. Although four studies did consider reduction in the number of spasms, it is no longer clear to us that a reduction in spasms is of any real benefit to a patient. Complete control of spasms has to be the main objective.</P>
<P>One small study that looked at participants with infantile spasms and an underlying diagnosis of tuberous sclerosis found vigabatrin to be more efficacious than hydrocortisone in stopping the spasms in this group of participants&#8212;a finding also reported in some open studies (e.g. <LINK REF="REF-Hancock-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hancock 1999</LINK>). One study (<LINK REF="STD-Elterman-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Elterman 2010</LINK>) suggested that vigabatrin was more effective in stopping the spasms in participants with tuberous sclerosis as compared with participants without a diagnosis of tuberous sclerosis. However, in participants without a diagnosis of tuberous sclerosis, the best available therapy remains unclear. Another study excluded participants with a known diagnosis of tuberous sclerosis or at high risk for tuberous sclerosis, and researchers suggested that hormonal treatment (tetracosactide or prednisolone) might be more efficacious in people who do not have an underlying diagnosis of tuberous sclerosis. No study has looked specifically at any other subgroup(s) of participants.</P>
<P>Some open, prospective studies have suggested that vigabatrin might control spasms more quickly than steroids. Five RCTs considered the time taken to cessation of spasms. Two small studies showed no difference between vigabatrin and a hormonal treatment, but one study found hormonal treatments to be quicker at resolving spasms than vigabatrin. This finding would be supported by the speed of response to hormonal treatment described by <LINK REF="STD-Baram-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Baram 1996</LINK>.</P>
<P>When we developed our protocol for this review, we decided to look at relapse rates as it was felt that this would be a useful outcome for clinicians. One treatment may be more efficacious in stopping the spasms in the short term, but if most of those patients subsequently relapse, another treatment with a lower but more sustained success rate might be considered more beneficial. When developing our analysis plan, we decided that we would analyse this information as dichotomous data. However, when we came to extract and analyse these data from the trials, it became apparent that they are censored data, that is, not all participants entered into a trial would be eligible for this outcome; only those in whom the spasms stopped could potentially relapse. We have, therefore, attempted to clarify this by also reporting how many participants remained spasm free, that is, never relapsed (an outcome for which all participants entered into any one trial were eligible). However, we believe that a more appropriate method of analysis would be to look at survival curves, and we will consider this as a more appropriate method of analysis in future updates of this review if individual patient data become available.</P>
<P>We had also planned to look at subgroup analysis by aetiological subgroup and by clinical features, but unfortunately, because of the small numbers of trials and patients and the lack of available detail, this was not possible. It was possible to consider participants with an underlying diagnosis of tuberous sclerosis as a subgroup in only two studies. One underpowered study (<LINK REF="STD-Chiron-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Chiron 1997</LINK>) showed vigabatrin to be more efficacious than hydrocortisone in stopping the spasms in this group of participants. All participants in this study who were treated with vigabatrin had complete cessation of spasms, and only one participant relapsed within the study period. However, the numbers were small, with only eleven participants in each group, and these results should be treated with caution, even though this result mimics the findings of open studies. Further trials with larger numbers of patients are required to confirm (or refute) the findings of this study. The second study (<LINK REF="STD-Elterman-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Elterman 2010</LINK>) found that 52% of 25 participants with tuberous sclerosis responded to vigabatrin within two weeks of treatment compared with 16% of 117 participants without tuberous sclerosis. Researchers stated that within three months, all participants with tuberous sclerosis who continued with vigabatrin were free of infantile spasms; however, two participants had been withdrawn from vigabatrin at this point, at least one because of lack of efficacy. These participants might also have received other treatments by three months. It is not clear, therefore, whether vigabatrin was responsible for the cessation of their spasms.</P>
<P>Side effects (adverse reactions) must always be taken into account. Any drug with unacceptable side effects will not be used in clinical practice. Likewise, if two drugs show similar beneficial effects, the one with the safer drug profile should be used in preference. Within these studies, few side effects or deaths were reported. However, both steroids and vigabatrin have potentially serious side effects. Steroids are associated with potentially life-threatening problems, including depression of the immune system and modified response to infection leading to overwhelming sepsis. Less serious side effects, for example, hypertension, are often transient but nevertheless have the potential to cause morbidity. Minor side effects, estimated to occur in two-thirds of patients, include behavioural changes, especially irritability, changes in appetite, weight gain, and alteration in sleep patterns. In addition, some forms of steroids (e.g. ACTH) involve daily or alternate-day intramuscular injections. However, reports have described both asymptomatic and symptomatic visual field defects with loss of peripheral vision to varying degrees in adults and children treated with vigabatrin. This appears to occur most commonly in patients who have been treated with vigabatrin for longer than six months; it does not appear to be reversible on withdrawal of the vigabatrin. The main difficulty in infants is that they cannot be tested or monitored for visual field defects (a child must be at least 11 years old to be able to co-operate and complete a reliable test). However, on balance, the devastating effects of infantile spasms and the poor response rate on placebo suggest that the risks of developing the severe side effects of these therapies are less important than the risk of not using the therapies.</P>
<P>The overwhelming conclusion is that more studies are required on this disorder, in particular studies that report long-term developmental and epilepsy outcomes.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2014-02-13 14:35:32 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Hormonal treatment (prednisolone (not prednisone), tetracosactide depot, and ACTH) resolves spasms faster than vigabatrin and in more infants, but it is not yet clear whether this will result in better long-term outcomes. Hormonal treatment might improve development in those with no proven underlying neurological disease, but the evidence is not robust. It is important to note that if prednisolone or vigabatrin is used, high dosage is recommended. The optimum dose of ACTH (or tetracosactide) is not yet known. Vigabatrin may be the treatment of choice in tuberous sclerosis. Other treatments cannot be recommended on the basis of the evidence reviewed. No evidence from the RCTs indicates that it is necessary to treat EEG features rather than spasms. A clear statement on the optimum treatment for infantile spasms requires further research. Until additional study results become available, other factors (in particular, underlying aetiology and adverse reactions) will influence parents and clinicians about individual treatment choices.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2013-02-26 12:01:57 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Further trials are needed with good methodology, standardised and valid outcome measures, larger numbers of participants, and detailed reporting, including other underlying neurological diseases, gender, time to treatment, time to response, EEG outcome, deaths, epilepsy outcome, and development. Adverse reactions need to be fully reported. Long-term follow-up of development is essential. As has been stated, infantile spasms are a relatively rare disorder, so if investigators are to recruit large numbers of patients into randomised controlled trials, continuing multi-centre collaboration is required.</P>
