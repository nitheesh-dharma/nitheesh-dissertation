<DESCRIPTION>
<P>The Background has been updated with recently published papers on mannitol in acute stroke. Two randomised studies have been found since the previous version of the review was published: both studies included patients with non-traumatic intracerebral haemorrhage. The number of included patients was small (29 and 128, respectively), and the studies did not find any difference in mannitol-treated patients compared with controls in short and long-term case fatality and disability. The conclusions of the review did not change. Based on the three small randomised trials there is no evidence to recommend the routine use of mannitol in patients with acute stroke.</P>

<SUMMARY>
<TITLE>Mannitol for acute stroke</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Brain swelling (oedema) is a major cause of early death and long-term disability after stroke (a sudden catastrophe in the brain either because an artery to the brain blocks, or because an artery in or on the brain ruptures and bleeds). Mannitol solution is given into a vein to reduce the swelling. Increased (rebound) swelling in the brain can occur after the treatment is stopped. This review of three small trials, involving 226 participants, found that there was not enough evidence to decide if mannitol improves survival or prevents disability after stroke. The treatment can cause a number of adverse effects, but no serious adverse events were reported in the trials included in this review. More research is needed.</P>
</SUMMARY_BODY>
</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Mannitol is an osmotic agent and a free radical scavenger which might decrease oedema and tissue damage in stroke.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To test whether treatment with mannitol reduces short and long-term case fatality and dependency after acute ischaemic stroke or intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH).</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (searched December 2006), MEDLINE (1966 to January 2007), the Chinese Stroke Trials Register (searched November 2006), the China Biological Medicine Database (searched December 2006) and the Latin-American database LILACS (1982 to December 2006). We also searched the database of Masters and PhD degree theses at Sao Paulo University (searched January 2007), and neurology and neurosurgery conference proceedings in Brazil from 1965 to 2006. In an effort to identify further published, ongoing and unpublished studies we searched reference lists and contacted authors of published trials.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>We included randomised controlled trials comparing mannitol with placebo or open control in patients with acute ischaemic stroke or non-traumatic intracerebral haemorrhage. </P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Two review authors independently selected trials, assessed quality, extracted data, and performed the data analysis. </P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Three small trials, involving 226 participants, were included. One trial included patients with presumed ischaemic stroke without computerised tomography (CT) verification, and the other two trials included patients with CT-verified ICH. Data on the primary outcome measure (death and dependency) were not available in any of the trials. Death and disability could be calculated in the larger ICH trial without differences between the mannitol and control groups. Case fatality was not reported in the trial of ischaemic stroke. Case fatality did not differ between the mannitol and control groups in the ICH trials. Adverse events were either not found or not reported. The change in clinical condition was reported in two trials, and the proportion of those with worsening or not improving condition did not differ significantly between mannitol-treated patients and controls. Based on these three trials neither beneficial nor harmful effects of mannitol could be proved. Although no statistically significant differences were found between the mannitol-treated and control groups, the confidence intervals for the treatment effect estimates were wide and included both clinically significant benefits and clinically significant harms as possibilities.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>There is currently not enough evidence to support the routine use of mannitol in acute stroke patients. Further trials are needed to confirm or refute whether mannitol is beneficial in acute stroke.</P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
</ABSTRACT>
<BODY MODIFIED="2008-09-03 15:19:38 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<BACKGROUND>
<P>There is no specific medical therapy that can be recommended for routine use in patients with acute ischaemic stroke except for aspirin (<LINK REF="REF-CAST-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">CAST 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-IST-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">IST 1997</LINK>). Thrombolysis with tissue plasminogen activator is recommended in selected patients (<LINK REF="REF-Adams-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Adams 1996</LINK>), but there is insufficient evidence to recommend the use of thrombolytic drugs in general to treat acute ischaemic stroke (<LINK REF="REF-Wardlaw-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wardlaw 2003</LINK>). Only a few randomised trials exist for non-traumatic intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH). Most of these could not prove a beneficial effect of medical (<LINK REF="REF-Poungvarin-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Poungvarin 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Yu-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yu 1992</LINK>) or surgical (<LINK REF="REF-Mendelow-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mendelow 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Prasad-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Prasad 1998</LINK>) interventions. The application of the recombinant activated coagulation factor VII (rFVIIa) is promising: within four hours after the onset of intracerebral haemorrhage it was reported to limit the growth of the haematoma, to reduce mortality, and to improve functional outcomes at 90 days, despite a small increase in the frequency of thromboembolic adverse events (<LINK REF="REF-Mayer-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mayer 2005</LINK>). </P>
<P>Ischaemic stroke is associated with cytotoxic (intracellular) and vasogenic (extracellular, interstitial) oedema (<LINK REF="REF-Katzman-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Katzman 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rabinstein-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rabinstein 2006</LINK>). Cytotoxic oedema develops in the first hours after the onset of ischaemic stroke and can be detected as a decrease in the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) of water. This reduction in ADC lasts for three to four days, and then increases as vasogenic oedema develops (<LINK REF="REF-Schlaug-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schlaug 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Warach-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Warach 1995</LINK>). A decrease in ADC was also shown in acute haemorrhagic stroke (<LINK REF="REF-Ebisu-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ebisu 1997</LINK>), but in contrast to ischaemic strokes, ADC in haemorrhagic stroke remains decreased even 100 days after stroke onset. Continuous monitoring of intracranial pressure (ICP) shows that the pronounced brain oedema which develops during the fourth to the 14th day of an intracerebral haemorrhage could lead to an increase in ICP requiring treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Haass-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haass 1987</LINK>). </P>
<P>Corticosteroids, although frequently used to treat cerebral oedema, did not increase survival after stroke (<LINK REF="REF-Qizilbash-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Qizilbash 2002</LINK>). Osmotic diuretics are among the agents that are widely used in the treatment of cerebral oedema (<LINK REF="REF-James-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">James 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Reyes-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reyes 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schierhout-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schierhout 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Woster-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Woster 1990</LINK>). Glycerol is frequently used in stroke in several countries, although currently there is not enough evidence to evaluate glycerol treatment for people with acute ischaemic stroke (<LINK REF="REF-Righetti-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Righetti 2004</LINK>). </P>
<P>Mannitol is thought to decrease ICP by decreasing overall water content of the brain and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) volume, and by reducing blood volume due to vasoconstriction (<LINK REF="REF-Davis-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davis 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Donato-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Donato 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Winkler-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Winkler 1995</LINK>). Mannitol may also improve cerebral perfusion by decreasing viscosity, or by altering red blood cell rheology (<LINK REF="REF-Andrews-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Andrews 1993</LINK>). As a free radical scavenger, mannitol may exert a protective effect against biochemical injury (<LINK REF="REF-Mizoi-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mizoi 1986</LINK>). It was observed, however, that in middle cerebral artery strokes mannitol had an effect on the non-infarcted hemisphere (<LINK REF="REF-Videen-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Videen 2001</LINK>), and in large hemispheric infarctions mannitol use did not alter midline tissue shifts (<LINK REF="REF-Manno-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Manno 1999</LINK>). </P>
<P>Mannitol is reported to decrease cerebral oedema, infarct size and neurological deficit in several experimental models of ischaemic stroke (<LINK REF="REF-Karibe-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Karibe 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kobayashi-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kobayashi 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Luvisotto-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Luvisotto 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Paczynski-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Paczynski 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Suzuki-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Suzuki 1980</LINK>), although mostly when administered within six hours after stroke onset. The results of some animal studies do not prove the beneficial effects of mannitol in rodent (<LINK REF="REF-Slivka-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Slivka 1990</LINK>) or monkey (<LINK REF="REF-Pena-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pena 1982</LINK>) models of ischaemic stroke. The worsening of cerebral oedema by multiple dose mannitol was also reported in cats (<LINK REF="REF-Kaufmann-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kaufmann 1992</LINK>). </P>
<P>Mannitol has been used in human ischaemic brain damage for over 40 years (<LINK REF="REF-Brient-1965" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brient 1965</LINK>). Cerebral oedema in humans is regularly treated with mannitol, which is known to decrease ICP in several diseases (<LINK REF="REF-James-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">James 1977</LINK>) and was found to decrease case fatality in cerebral oedema due to hepatic failure (<LINK REF="REF-Canalese-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Canalese 1982</LINK>). In one study of middle cerebral artery territory stroke, treatment modalities for raised ICP, including osmotherapy, were initially effective, but ICP control could only be sustained in a minority of patients (<LINK REF="REF-Schwab-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schwab 1996</LINK>). Although mannitol decreases elevated intracranial pressure after stroke (<LINK REF="REF-Schwarz-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schwarz 1998</LINK>) and results in increased cerebral perfusion pressure and brain oxygenation in large hemispheric strokes (<LINK REF="REF-Steiner-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Steiner 2001</LINK>), its overall effect on stroke outcome is unclear. A harmful effect of a single very large dose was assumed although not found in complete middle cerebral artery infarcts in humans (<LINK REF="REF-Manno-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Manno 1999</LINK>). In an observational study of 800 patients with acute stroke we could not find any benefit of mannitol use, in fact, the odds for survival was lower in mannitol-treated patients especially in those with ICH (<LINK REF="REF-Bereczki-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bereczki 2003</LINK>). Early high-dose mannitol treatment, on the other hand, was reported to result in improved clinical outcome by two randomised trials in traumatic cerebral haemorrhages (<LINK REF="STD-Cruz-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Cruz 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cruz-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Cruz 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>The most common complications of mannitol therapy are fluid and electrolyte imbalances, cardiopulmonary oedema and rebound cerebral oedema (<LINK REF="REF-Davis-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davis 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Troupp-1971" TYPE="REFERENCE">Troupp 1971</LINK>). Mannitol might cause kidney failure (<LINK REF="REF-Oken-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oken 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rabetoy-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rabetoy 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Weaver-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weaver 1987</LINK>) in therapeutic doses, and hypersensitivity reactions may also occur (<LINK REF="REF-McNeill-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">McNeill 1985</LINK>). </P>
<P>Mannitol is widely used in acute stroke all over the world. Although there are several reports of trials that were unable to establish reliably any beneficial effect of mannitol in ischaemic or haemorrhagic strokes in humans (<LINK REF="REF-Candelise-1974" TYPE="REFERENCE">Candelise 1974</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Candelise-1975" TYPE="REFERENCE">Candelise 1975</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gigliuto-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gigliuto 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Santambrogio-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Santambrogio 1978</LINK>), the guidelines of the American Heart Association (<LINK REF="REF-Adams-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Adams 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Broderick-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Broderick 1999</LINK>) as well as the guidelines of the European Stroke Initiative (<LINK REF="REF-EUSI-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">EUSI 2003</LINK>) currently recommend the use of mannitol in certain clinical conditions in selected cases of acute stroke. Almost 70% of physicians in China, and the majority of physicians in India use mannitol or glycerol routinely in acute stroke (<LINK REF="REF-Chen-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chen 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kalita-2004b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kalita 2004b</LINK>). Although treatment with osmotic diuretics seems logical from a physiological point of view, and mannitol has some effect on the brain in ischaemic stroke (<LINK REF="REF-Onar-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Onar 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Treib-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Treib 1998</LINK>), it is presently not clear whether the routine use of mannitol results in increased survival and decreased dependency in patients with ischaemic stroke or non-traumatic ICH.</P>

<P>We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register, which was last searched by the Review Group Co-ordinator in December 2006. In addition, one of the authors (ML) searched for studies published in Chinese in the Chinese Stroke Trials Register (last searched November 2006), and in the China Biological Medicine Database (last searched December 2006).

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Methods used to select trials for inclusion</HEADING>
<P>At least two of the four review authors independently judged each identified trial to determine if it should be included in the review. For studies reported in non-English languages, one of the review authors had to know the language and the other review author made their decision based on the data extracted. For trials reported in languages not familiar to the review authors, we planned to arrange consultations to obtain a reliable translation. Such consultations were held for trial reports in Chinese. We resolved disagreements by discussion among the review authors. Before data analysis, all review authors agreed on each trial to be included.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Criteria and methods used to assess the methodological quality of the included trials</HEADING>
<P>We used a structured data collection form. We evaluated the trials for methodological quality, including the method of randomisation and blinding, the concealment of randomisation, the balance in baseline prognostic factors between treatment and control groups, whether computerised tomography (CT) scanning was performed, patient follow up, and whether an intention-to-treat analysis was performed.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Methods used to collect data from the included trials</HEADING>
<P>After reaching an agreement on which trials to include, two of the review authors (DB and IF) independently extracted data from the trials and performed the data analysis. Agreement of data extraction was checked by comparing the two results.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Methods used to synthesise the data</HEADING>
<P>We performed data synthesis and analysis using the Cochrane Review Manager software, RevMan 4.2. We planned to use the I-squared test to assess heterogeneity between the studies. We used the Peto odds ratio for calculating relative treatment effects.</P>
<P>We planned to include all trials in the primary analysis, irrespective of whether the trials primarily intended to include patients with only ischaemic stroke or only haemorrhagic stroke. We planned separate subgroup analyses on outcome in patients with confirmed ischaemic stroke, and in patients with ICH confirmed by CT scan or CSF examination. As mannitol might be more effective in patients with more severe brain oedema, we planned to perform a subgroup analysis for those patients who had a decreased level of consciousness. We planned a further subgroup analysis for studies with intravenous administration of mannitol. Trials would be analysed separately if a dose of at least 1 g/kg of mannitol was given as it was found that administration of 1 g/kg/dose, or higher, consistently reduced ICP from control values, but dosages below 1 g/kg/dose did not always reduce ICP (<LINK REF="REF-James-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">James 1980</LINK>). We planned a separate analysis of studies where the total daily dose was divided into three or more doses as the oedema-reducing effect of mannitol lasts for a few hours. We planned a further analysis of studies where mannitol was given for longer than seven days as oedema around the ischaemic or haemorrhagic region might persist for longer periods of time. We also planned to do a sensitivity analysis to compare the overall results when all trials were included with the results when the analysis is restricted to trials in which patients had a CT scan.</P>

<STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<P>The searches resulted in sixteen possibly randomised controlled trials for possible inclusion. Eight of these studies were published in Chinese language journals (<LINK REF="STD-Jiang-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Jiang 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kong-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Kong 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shi-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Shi 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wu-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Wu 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Xie-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Xie 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Xie-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Xie 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zhao-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Zhao 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zhen-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Zhen 1996</LINK>) but all of them turned out to be either not truly randomised or confounded trials, therefore these trials were excluded. In the studies by Freeman et al (<LINK REF="STD-Freeman-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Freeman 1978</LINK>) and Hooshmand et al (<LINK REF="STD-Hooshmand-1972" TYPE="STUDY">Hooshmand 1972</LINK>) dexamethasone was co-administered with mannitol, therefore no clear conclusion could be made for mannitol from these trials and they were excluded. The trial of Battison et al (<LINK REF="STD-Battison-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Battison 2005</LINK>) as well as the trials of Cruz et al (<LINK REF="STD-Cruz-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Cruz 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cruz-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Cruz 2004</LINK>) studied patients with traumatic lesions and did not include patients with ischaemic stroke or spontaneous intracerebral haemorrhages, therefore these trials were also excluded. Three studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria for this review. The study by Santambrogio et al randomised 300 patients to one control and three treatment groups: a mixture of ergot alkaloids, dexamethasone or mannitol (<LINK REF="STD-Santambrogio-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Santambrogio 1978</LINK>). Mannitol was administered intravenously once a day in a dose of 0.8 to 0.9 g/kg for 10 days. Data are reported on 166 patients, 41 belonged to the control group and 36 to the mannitol group. The reported outcome of the only included study of ischaemic stroke was the change in clinical condition categorised as improved, unchanged, or worsened. Kalita et al (<LINK REF="STD-Kalita-2004a" TYPE="STUDY">Kalita 2004a</LINK>) evaluated the effect of a single dose of intravenous mannitol (100 ml 20% solution) on regional cerebral blood flow in patients with CT-proven ICH. Originally 29 patients were randomised to the study (15 mannitol and 14 controls) within six days of stroke onset, but data are reported for 12 mannitol-treated patients and nine controls. Changes in Glasgow coma scale score and a single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) asymmetry index were the endpoints. Case fatality was also recorded at one month. To achieve intention-to-treat analysis, we requested clinical outcome data for the eight missing cases from the authors. The trial of Misra et al (<LINK REF="STD-Misra-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Misra 2005</LINK>) included 128 patients with CT-proven ICH, and the reported outcomes are case fatality at one month and functional disability at three months. In this trial 20 g (100 ml 20%) of mannitol was given every four hours for five days.</P>
</STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<STUDY_QUALITY>
<P>In the trial of Santambrogio et al (<LINK REF="STD-Santambrogio-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Santambrogio 1978</LINK>) 45% of the patients were excluded from the data analysis. Based on clinical criteria, those who were assumed to have cerebral haemorrhage, cerebral embolism, or transient ischaemic attack, were excluded. Of the 300 patients, 241 had presumed ischaemic stroke, but only 166 were included in the data analysis, that is in addition to those who were excluded due to presumed haemorrhagic strokes, more than 30% of patients with presumed ischaemic events were not included in the data analysis. The number of patients randomised initially to the different groups but not included in data analysis is not reported and no intention-to-treat analysis was performed. The method of randomisation was not reported and no information about the concealment of allocation and blinding of outcome evaluation was available. CT was either not performed or the results not reported in the study. As clinical and CSF examinations are not reliable methods to exclude cerebral haemorrhage, some of those who were considered to have ischaemic strokes might have had haemorrhagic stroke. Follow up was not performed after 10 days. Case fatality and the proportion of those who were dependent were not reported and data were not available from the investigators. There was no mention about adverse events.</P>
<P>Kalita et al (<LINK REF="STD-Kalita-2004a" TYPE="STUDY">Kalita 2004a</LINK>) randomised 29 patients within six days of stroke onset using a randomisation table. There is no information about the concealment of allocation and blinding of outcome evaluation. CT was performed in all patients to prove ICH. Although the primary endpoints of the study were the acute change in Glasgow coma scale score and the reduction in asymmetry in the SPECT images, case fatality at one month after treatment of a single infusion was also reported. Data for 21 out of 29 patients are presented: eight patients (three in the mannitol group and five in the control group) were excluded from analysis due to the poor quality of the SPECT images. There was no mention about adverse events. Survival and disability data for these eight patients were requested from the investigators but no answer was received. </P>
<P>Misra et al (<LINK REF="STD-Misra-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Misra 2005</LINK>) randomised 128 patients within six days of ICH onset using random table numbers. Randomisation was stratified according to haematoma size (small, medium, large) on the CT images. CT was performed before randomisation in all patients. Randomisation and outcome evaluations were performed by independent investigators. The primary endpoint was case fatality at one month. Disability (Barthel index) at three months and case fatality at one week is also reported. Functional disability was poor if the Barthel index score was below 12 of 20, partial if the score was between 12 and 19. The level of dependency was not reported. Sample size estimation was done assuming 20% reduction in case fatality in the treated group. 164 patients were screened and 128 of them were randomised (65 to the mannitol group and 63 to the control group). There were no patients lost to follow up. </P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Comparison 01.01: Death or disability</HEADING>
<P>In the only trial of ischaemic stroke (<LINK REF="STD-Santambrogio-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Santambrogio 1978</LINK>) the reported outcome was the change in clinical condition and no data on death and dependency was published or was available from the investigators. One death occurred in the small trial of ICH (<LINK REF="STD-Kalita-2004a" TYPE="STUDY">Kalita 2004a</LINK>), but due to lack of data on dependency, the primary outcome measure could not be evaluated in this trial. The primary outcome measure of this review could be approximated only for one trial of ICH (<LINK REF="STD-Misra-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Misra 2005</LINK>). In this trial poor outcome (death or severe disability) occurred in 39 mannitol-treated patients and in 34 controls. Of those with large haemorrhages all patients had poor outcome in the mannitol group (23 out of 23) as well as in the control group (20 out of 20). In medium-sized haematomas poor outcome occurred in 14 of the 23 participants in the mannitol group, and 13 of the 21 participants in the control group. Of the 96 survivors, outcome was poor in 23 out of 49 mannitol-treated participants, and 18 out of 47 controls. As data on dependency was not reported, instead of the planned primary outcome measure of death and dependency, we could only analyse poor outcome as death and severe disability, and considered those who scored less than 12 on the Barthel index to be severely disabled. There was no statistically significant difference between the treatment groups.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Comparison 01.02: Case fatality</HEADING>
<P>In the only trial of ischaemic stroke (<LINK REF="STD-Santambrogio-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Santambrogio 1978</LINK>) no data on death was published or available from the investigators. At one month one patient died in the mannitol group and none among the controls in the small trial of ICH (<LINK REF="STD-Kalita-2004a" TYPE="STUDY">Kalita 2004a</LINK>). In the other trial of ICH, in the first week of treatment 10 patients died, whereas by one month 16 patients died in each group (65 mannitol and 63 control), with no difference between the mannitol and the control groups (<LINK REF="STD-Misra-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Misra 2005</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Comparisons 01.03 and 01.04: Clinical condition worsening/not improving</HEADING>
<P>Change in clinical condition is not included among the predefined secondary outcome measures of this review. However, as very few data exist for mannitol from randomised trials, and two of the three trials reported this outcome, it might be interesting to look at these numbers as well. The reported outcome of the only study of ischaemic stroke (<LINK REF="STD-Santambrogio-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Santambrogio 1978</LINK>) was the change in clinical condition categorised as improved, unchanged, or worsened. Fourteen of 41 controls (34%) and 12 of 36 mannitol-treated patients (33%) improved, whereas the number of those whose condition worsened was 18 of 41 (44%) and 16 of 36 (44%) in the control and mannitol-treated groups, respectively, with no difference between groups. In the small study of ICH, the Glasgow Coma Scale score improved in six out of 12 mannitol-treated patients, and seven out of nine control patients (<LINK REF="STD-Kalita-2004a" TYPE="STUDY">Kalita 2004a</LINK>). Worsening was recorded in two out of 12 mannitol-treated patients and none among the nine controls. The proportion of those with worsening or not improving clinical condition did not differ between groups.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Adverse events, length of hospital stay, quality of life</HEADING>
<P>No serious adverse events were reported, and no data on hospital stay and on quality of life were available. In the Misra trial, two of the mannitol-treated patients and six controls had hyponatraemia (<LINK REF="STD-Misra-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Misra 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>There were too few studies to assess heterogeneity and to perform the preplanned sensitivity and subgroup analyses. Using the Peto odds ratios method, neither beneficial nor harmful effects of mannitol could be found. Based on the limited data available, short (one week) and long-term (one month) case fatality, and the proportion of dead or severely disabled patients at the end of the follow up were not significantly different in mannitol-treated patients and in controls. Similarly, the proportion of those who worsened and those who did not improve were also not statistically different between mannitol-treated patients and controls. Mannitol did not prove to have beneficial or harmful effect if the analysis was restricted to large or medium-sized haematomas. Although no statistically significant differences were found between the mannitol-treated and the control groups, the confidence intervals for the treatment effect estimates were wide and included both clinically significant benefits and clinically significant harms as possibilities.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>Despite the facts that mannitol has been widely used to decrease raised intracranial pressure (<LINK REF="REF-Rabinstein-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rabinstein 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schierhout-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schierhout 1998</LINK>), and both ischaemic strokes and ICHs are associated with some cerebral oedema, very few randomised trials have been performed to study the effects of mannitol in acute stroke. Of the 16 trials found by the searches only three were unconfounded, truly randomised trials in acute ischaemic stroke or non-traumatic ICH. In the only one unconfounded randomised trial of mannitol in acute ischaemic stroke (<LINK REF="STD-Santambrogio-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Santambrogio 1978</LINK>) the method of randomisation was not stated, information on concealment of randomisation was not available, CT was not performed, no intention-to-treat analysis was performed, the number of included patients was small, the follow-up period was very short, and no data could be obtained for case fatality and dependency from the investigators. In the two trials of ICH (<LINK REF="STD-Kalita-2004a" TYPE="STUDY">Kalita 2004a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Misra-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Misra 2005</LINK>), case fatality, and the proportion of severely disabled patients at the end of the follow up, and the proportion of those with worsening or not improving condition did not differ significantly between mannitol-treated patients and controls. All three trials used mannitol in a dose lower than 1 g/kg/dose, the dosage below which mannitol did not always reduce ICP (<LINK REF="REF-James-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">James 1980</LINK>). Based on these three small trials there is currently not enough evidence to decide whether the routine use of mannitol in acute stroke would result in any beneficial or harmful effect. Therefore the routine use of mannitol in all patients with acute stroke is not supported by any evidence from the existing randomised clinical trials.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>Although the beneficial effect of mannitol in acute stroke can not be excluded, and the use of mannitol in certain clinical conditions in selected cases of acute stroke might be appropriate (for example, in those with decreased level of consciousness), the routine use of mannitol in all patients with acute stroke cannot be recommended at present.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>The clinical efficacy of mannitol in acute stroke has not yet been properly evaluated. Based on some animal experiments and clinical observations mannitol has effects that might be beneficial in acute stroke. To prove this hypothesis placebo-controlled, unconfounded, properly randomised clinical studies have to be designed and performed. In these studies the registration of early and late case fatality and of valid and reliable measures of dependency and disability are recommended. Brain CT should be part of the study protocol, long-term follow up (for example, three and six months) should be mandatory, and intention-to-treat analysis should be performed. </P>
