<TITLE>Vitamin B for treating disorders of the peripheral nerves</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2008-05-14 14:12:56 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Jewitt">
<P>Peripheral neuropathy is a disorder of the peripheral nerves resulting from different causes, such as diabetes mellitus and alcoholism, leading to pain, numbness or weakness of the limbs and other problems. Vitamin B is commonly used to treat peripheral neuropathy but it is not clear if it helps. This review of 13 trials on diabetic and alcoholic peripheral neuropathy with a total of 741 participants showed only one study that suggested possible short-term benefit from eight-week treatment with benfotiamine (a derivative of vitamin B1) with slightly greater improvement in vibration perception threshold compared to placebo. Vitamin B complex when given in a higher dose administered for four weeks was more efficacious than a lower dose in reducing pain and other clinical problems based on another study. Two to eight weeks of treatment with vitamin B was less efficacious than alpha-lipoic acid, cilostazol or cytidine triphosphate in short-term improvement of clinical and nerve test findings. All these findings require confirmation in larger studies before they can be accepted as definite. Vitamin B is generally well-tolerated with only a few reports of mild side effects.<BR/>

<P>We searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group Trials Register (searched August 2005), MEDLINE (January 1966 to September 2005), EMBASE (January 1980 to September 2005), Philippine databases (searched September 2005) and reference lists of articles.

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2008-05-14 14:47:41 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Jewitt">
<P>Thirteen studies involving 741 participants with alcoholic or diabetic neuropathy were included. In the comparison of vitamin B with placebo, two small trials showed no significant short-term benefit in pain intensity while one of the trials showed a small significant benefit in vibration detection from oral benfotiamine, a derivative of thiamine. In the larger of two trials comparing different doses of vitamin B complex, there was some evidence that higher doses resulted in a significant short-term reduction in pain and improvement in paraesthesiae, in a composite outcome combining pain, temperature and vibration, and in a composite outcome combining pain, numbness and paraesthesiae. There was some evidence that vitamin B is less efficacious than alpha-lipoic acid, cilostazol or cytidine triphosphate in the short-term improvement of clinical and nerve conduction study outcomes but the trials were small. There were few minor adverse effects reported.<BR/>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2008-05-14 14:12:20 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Jewitt">
<P>There are only limited data in randomised trials testing the efficacy of vitamin B for treating peripheral neuropathy and the evidence is insufficient to determine whether vitamin B is beneficial or harmful. One small trial in alcoholic peripheral neuropathy reported slightly greater improvement in vibration perception threshold with oral benfotiamine for eight weeks than placebo. In another small study, a higher dose of oral vitamin B complex for four weeks was more efficacious than a lower dose in reducing symptoms and signs. Vitamin B administered by various routes for two to eight weeks was less efficacious than alpha-lipoic acid, cilostazol or cytidine triphosphate in short-term improvement of clinical and nerve conduction study outcomes. Vitamin B is generally well-tolerated.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-05-14 14:13:37 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Jewitt">
<P>The term 'peripheral neuropathy' has been used to cover any disorder of the peripheral nervous system which may affect the sensory, motor or autonomic functions but this review focused on generalised peripheral neuropathies. The prevalence is estimated at 2400 per 100,000, increasing with age to 8000 per 100,000 (<LINK REF="REF-Hughes-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hughes 2002</LINK>). The common causes are diabetes, alcohol, human immunodeficiency virus infection, and, in some parts of the world, leprosy.</P>
<P>The availability and affordability of vitamin B complex makes this drug a frequent choice for treating peripheral neuropathy. Strong evidence in the literature on the efficacy of vitamin B complex, however, is lacking. The vitamin B complex is a group of water-soluble compounds that differ in chemical structure and biological action. Traditionally, the vitamin B complex includes: thiamine (vitamin B1), riboflavin (vitamin B2), nicotinic acid (vitamin B3), pantothenic acid (vitamin B5), pyridoxine (vitamin B6), biotin (vitamin B7), folic acid (vitamin B9), cyanocobalamin (vitamin B12), para-aminobenzoic acid, inositol, and choline (<LINK REF="REF-Marcus-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marcus 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>Some vitamin B compounds have derivatives. Benfotiamine is a lipid-soluble derivative of vitamin B1 which is better absorbed after oral administration than the water-soluble thiamine salts resulting in higher levels of the active compound in blood and tissues (<LINK REF="STD-Stracke-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Stracke 1996</LINK>). Vitamin B12 has several congeners: cyanocobalamin, hydroxocobalamin, methylcobalamin, and 5'-deoxyadenosylcobalamin. The latter two are active co-enzymes. Vitamin B12 preparations for therapeutic use contain either cyanocobalamin or hydroxocobalamin as these are the only derivatives that remain active after storage (<LINK REF="REF-Kaushansky-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kaushansky 2006</LINK>). It is not clear whether vitamin B derivatives or congeners exert different therapeutic effects from their parent compounds.</P>
<P>The vitamin B complex functions as coenzymes in several intermediary metabolic pathways for energy generation and blood cell formation which cannot be explained simply. Thiamine is converted to thiamine pyrophosphate that functions in carbohydrate metabolism as a coenzyme in the decarboxylation of alpha-keto acids and alpha-ketoglutarate and in the utilisation of pentose in the hexose monophosphate shunt. Thiamine pyrophosphate appears to play a role in the transmission of nerve impulses. Riboflavin is converted into flavin mononucleotide and flavin adenine dinucleotide that serve as coenzymes for respiratory flavoproteins. Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate, the active forms of nicotinic acid, are coenzymes for proteins that catalyse oxidation-reduction reactions in tissue respiration. Pyridoxine, pyridoxamine, and pyridoxal are converted to pyridoxal phosphate that is involved in the metabolic transformations of amino acids and in the metabolism of sulfur-containing and hydroxyl-amino acids. Pyridoxal phosphate is required for the synthesis of sphingolipids for myelin formation as well. Cobalamin is converted to methylcobalamin and 5-deoxyadenosylcobalamin which are vital in cell growth and replication. Folic acid is converted to several coenzymes essential in cellular metabolism, including the synthesis of some deoxyribose nucleic acid components and normal red blood cell formation.</P>
<P>Vitamin B plays a vital role in energy metabolism. Nerve tissue may be affected in deficiency states due to its "high-energy demand or specific effects of the vitamin" (<LINK REF="REF-Chaney-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chaney 1992</LINK>). Common deficiency features include peripheral neuropathy, depression, mental confusion, lack of motor co-ordination, and malaise. Specific vitamin B deficiency diseases in humans include beriberi (thiamine), pellagra (nicotinamide), megaloblastic anaemia (folic acid), and pernicious anaemia (cobalamin). The required daily intakes of B vitamins for a normal adult are as follows: thiamine 1.0 to 1.5 mg, riboflavin 1.2 to 1.7 mg, pyridoxine 1.4 to 2.0 mg, niacin 13 to 19 niacin equivalents (<LINK REF="REF-Chaney-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chaney 1992</LINK>); cobalamin 3 to 5 mg and folic acid 50 mg (<LINK REF="REF-Hillman-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hillman 1996</LINK>). Higher doses of vitamin B are recommended for the treatment of certain deficiency states with neuropathy such as: 40 mg oral thiamine per day for thiamine deficiency, 10 to 20 mg pyridoxine per day for peripheral neuropathy induced by isoniazid (<LINK REF="REF-Olson-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Olson 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>While the indications for some members of the vitamin B complex for certain conditions such as thiamine for the treatment of Wernicke's encephalopathy (<LINK REF="REF-RodriguezMartin-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">RodriguezMartin 2002</LINK>), and folic acid for the treatment of folic acid deficiency anaemia (<LINK REF="REF-Mahomed-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mahomed 2002</LINK>) and the prevention of neural tube defects (<LINK REF="REF-Lumley-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lumley 2001</LINK>) are well established, their role in the treatment of peripheral neuropathies has not been well documented. <BR/>

<SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2008-08-12 14:28:44 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Jewitt">
<CRIT_STUDIES>
<P>We included randomised and quasi-randomised studies in which vitamin B was compared with placebo, another treatment, or no treatment.</P>
</CRIT_STUDIES>
<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>We included studies on all participants with generalised peripheral neuropathy diagnosed on the basis of symptoms and impairments or symptoms and abnormal neurophysiological results. Diagnosis based on symptoms alone, impairments alone or abnormal neurophysiological results alone was not sufficient. Symptoms included subjective complaints of pain, tingling, numbness, weakness, and autonomic symptoms. Impairments were measured on neurological examination by testing sensory loss, weakness, decreased reflexes, decreased vibration perception, and abnormal autonomic functions, or detected on nerve conduction studies. </P>
</CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>We included studies on vitamin B containing thiamine, riboflavin, nicotinic acid, pyridoxine, or cobalamin (or their derivatives), singly or in combination, given in any dose, by any route, for at least two weeks. We included studies on folic acid only if it was a part of a combined preparation containing other vitamin B compounds. </P>

<DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2008-05-14 15:02:28 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Jewitt">
<P>Two authors independently reviewed the titles and abstracts of all the articles identified by the search for relevance to the research problem and eligibility based on specified inclusion criteria. We retrieved the full text of relevant studies. All non-English language articles were translated to English prior to detailed review. Two authors independently reviewed the articles for eligibility using predetermined inclusion criteria. We contacted the study authors for missing information.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Quality review</HEADING>
<P>Two authors independently appraised the methodological quality of the studies using a four-item quality assessment instrument that evaluated the following areas: secure method of randomisation, concealment of allocation, blinding, and completeness of follow-up (<LINK REF="REF-Annane-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Annane 2004</LINK>). After independent evaluation, the authors convened and discussed individual ratings based on the assessment criteria. We discussed and documented discrepancies on the quality evaluation.

To combine the results of the studies if meta-analysis had been possible, we would have calculated the pooled RR with its 95% CI. For continuous outcomes, we calculated the mean difference (MD) with its 95% CI. For studies that did not report outcomes in standard deviation (SD), we derived the SD from the published variance or standard error. For change scores or values, we compared the baseline means in the treatment and control groups using two-sample t-test with equal variances. A P value of 0.05 was used as the cut-off value to determine statistical significance. If there was no sufficient evidence to conclude that the baseline means in the treatment and control groups were different from each other (P &gt; 0.05), we calculated the MD with its 95% CI using the endpoint means. If the P value was less than 0.05, we did not calculate the MD using the endpoint means, and we did not estimate the treatment effect size. We provided qualitative summary of the treatment effect instead. For continuous outcomes and outcomes in change scores, we would have summarised the measures across studies by calculating the weighted mean difference (WMD) or standardised mean difference (SMD) and 95% CI using Review Manager.</P>
<P>For studies with multiple reported outcomes on impairments and neuropathic symptoms, we selected only one variable for each outcome for analysis. For neurophysiological outcomes, we analysed predetermined nerves in the upper limb and lower limb for both the sensory and motor nerve conduction studies.</P>
<P>If there had been sufficient trials, we would have calculated the I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic to assess heterogeneity using Review Manager. An I<SUP>2</SUP> value greater than 50% is taken to mean that a significant amount of heterogeneity existed among the studies. For analyses that are found to be heterogeneous, the assumptions of the fixed-effect model underlying the calculation of the WMD or SMD may not be satisfied. Therefore, we would have based our analysis on the random-effects model as this is more conservative and appropriate. We did not perform the planned sensitivity analysis to further explore heterogeneity or on studies with and without 'adequate' rating for allocation concealment due to an insufficient number of included studies.</P>
<P>We compared separately the different types of vitamin B and studies where vitamin B was compared with placebo, in different doses, and with other active treatment ('other substance'). We did not analyse separate subgroups of painful and painless neuropathy and of diabetic, alcoholic, and other causes of neuropathy due to an insufficient number of included studies. We also did not perform separate analysis on participants with particular documented vitamin B deficiencies. We calculated the proportion of participants who developed adverse events from treatment with vitamin B.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Participants</HEADING>
<P>The 13 eligible studies included 741 participants with 488 patients treated with vitamin B alone (including different doses) and 253 patients treated with either placebo or another substance (alpha-lipoic acid, berlition, cilostazol, cytidine triphosphate, epalrestat or thioctic acid). <LINK REF="STD-Abbas-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Abbas 1997</LINK> was the largest study, accounting for 200 of the total 488 (41%) participants treated with vitamin B. The age range of the participants was from 18 to 74 years. All participants were diagnosed to have generalised peripheral neuropathy based on a priori selection criteria. Eleven studies were on diabetic neuropathy and two were on alcoholic neuropathy (<LINK REF="STD-Woelk-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Woelk 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kovrazhkina-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Kovrazhkina 2004</LINK>). None of the studies had documented vitamin B deficiency. Two studies excluded participants with vitamin B1 deficiency (<LINK REF="STD-Li-X-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Li X 2005</LINK>) and vitamin B12 deficiency (<LINK REF="STD-Stracke-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Stracke 1996</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Interventions</HEADING>
<P>The 13 included studies were grouped into pair wise comparisons according to: (1) the type of vitamin B compounds and (2) whether vitamin B was compared with placebo, different doses, or other substances. 'Vitamin B complex' refers to combination of two or more types of vitamin B compounds. Five studies compared vitamin B with placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Levin-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Levin 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yaqub-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Yaqub 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Duque-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Duque 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stracke-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Stracke 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Woelk-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Woelk 1998</LINK>) and none compared vitamin B to no treatment. 'Other substances' are agents other than vitamin B used as active treatments. Alpha-lipoic acid, berlition, and thioctic acid are different names for the same substance which is an anti-oxidant. All of these are referred as 'alpha-lipoic acid' throughout this review. Cilostazol is a selective cAMP phosphodiesterase inhibitor. Cytidine triphosphate is a pyrimidine nucleotide. Epalrestat is an aldose reductase inhibitor. Seven studies compared vitamin B to active treatments of which two were different doses of vitamin B (<LINK REF="STD-Abbas-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Abbas 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Winkler-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Winkler 1999</LINK>). Six studies compared vitamin B with other substances (<LINK REF="STD-Ziegler-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Ziegler 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Strokov-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Strokov 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hu-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Hu 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kovrazhkina-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Kovrazhkina 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Li-X-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Li X 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zhang-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Zhang 2005</LINK>). The 13 included studies used single or combined oral, intramuscular (IM) or intravenous (IV) vitamin B preparations in varying doses that were administered for at least two weeks.</P>
<P>Six studies reported concomitant use of drugs other than vitamin B, eg oral hypoglycaemic agents, insulin, or both (<LINK REF="STD-Levin-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Levin 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yaqub-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Yaqub 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ziegler-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Ziegler 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Strokov-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Strokov 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Li-X-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Li X 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zhang-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Zhang 2005</LINK>). We assumed insulin was used in one study (<LINK REF="STD-Winkler-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Winkler 1999</LINK>). One study reported non-use of other agents in addition to vitamin B but did not state if insulin was used (<LINK REF="STD-Duque-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Duque 1994</LINK>). In one study, all except five participants continued to consume alcohol during the trial (<LINK REF="STD-Kovrazhkina-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Kovrazhkina 2004</LINK>). Data on the use of drugs other than vitamin B were not published in four studies (<LINK REF="STD-Abbas-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Abbas 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Woelk-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Woelk 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hu-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Hu 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kovrazhkina-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Kovrazhkina 2004</LINK>).

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Outcomes</HEADING>
<P>This review included four outcomes with two primary and two secondary outcomes. Short-term (three months or less) change and long-term (after more than three months) change for each outcome were recorded. Most studies reported outcomes with short-term change with only four studies reporting outcomes with long-term change (<LINK REF="STD-Levin-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Levin 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yaqub-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Yaqub 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ziegler-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Ziegler 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zhang-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Zhang 2005</LINK>). All included studies reported clinical outcomes. Six studies reported on short-term change in pain intensity and 10 studies on short-term change in impairment. Three studies did not publish NCS outcomes (<LINK REF="STD-Abbas-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Abbas 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Woelk-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Woelk 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Winkler-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Winkler 1999</LINK>). The most frequently reported NCS outcome was short-term change in motor NCV of the common peroneal nerve or other lower extremity motor nerves (eight studies). None of the studies published data on serious adverse events. Six studies, however, reported non-serious adverse events from treatment with either vitamin B or the comparison intervention (<LINK REF="STD-Duque-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Duque 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Abbas-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Abbas 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Strokov-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Strokov 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hu-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Hu 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kovrazhkina-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Kovrazhkina 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Li-X-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Li X 2005</LINK>).</P>

<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Woelk-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Woelk 1998</LINK> reported on vibration perception threshold (VPT) measured at both great toes and ankles, with increase in score indicating improvement. The baseline mean for VPT obtained at the right great toe in the 30 participants treated with oral benfotiamine was 0.77 (SD 0.26) compared to 0.79 (SD 0.29) in the 28 participants on placebo, difference -0.02. There was insufficient evidence to conclude that the baseline means were different from each other (P = 0.78). After eight weeks of treatment, the means were 2.89 (SD 0.61) and 2.25 (SD 0.52), respectively, with statistically significant difference favouring vitamin B (MD 0.64, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.94).</P>

Eleven out of 14 (78.57%) participants treated with mecobalamin did not improve compared to eight out of nine (88.89%) participants on placebo after four weeks of treatment. The RR of not having an improvement in "vibratory sensation" was 0.88 (95% CI 0.62 to 1.26).</P>
<P>A third study published VPT measured at the metacarpal and metatarsal bones with decrease in value indicating improvement (<LINK REF="STD-Stracke-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Stracke 1996</LINK>).

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2008-05-14 14:47:29 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Jewitt">
<P>The trials of vitamin B for peripheral neuropathy in this review varied in terms of type of vitamin B compound, dose, route, and duration of treatment. Three studies published varying doses at different time points with decreased dose schedule after three days to four weeks of initiation of treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Stracke-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Stracke 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Abbas-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Abbas 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Woelk-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Woelk 1998</LINK>). Treatment duration ranged from two weeks (<LINK REF="STD-Li-X-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Li X 2005</LINK>) to four months (<LINK REF="STD-Levin-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Levin 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yaqub-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Yaqub 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zhang-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Zhang 2005</LINK>). The dose of vitamin B was within the recommended daily allowance (RDA) in all included studies except for two studies. The low dose regimen in the study of <LINK REF="STD-Abbas-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Abbas 1997</LINK> is within the RDA for thiamine (1 mg/day) but not for pyridoxine (1 mg/day) in which the dose was lower than the RDA. In the study of <LINK REF="STD-Strokov-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Strokov 1999</LINK>, the dose of riboflavin at 1% solution in 200 ml of normal saline solution is lower than the RDA. Theoretically, lower doses of vitamin B would be expected to exert less therapeutic effect or placebo-like effect. It is not known whether the adequate dose for treatment approximates or is higher than the RDA for specific types of vitamin B. The ideal route and duration of treatment and the effects of combining different types of vitamin B for treating peripheral neuropathy are also not known.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="2">Interpretation of the treatment effects</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">1. Vitamin B versus placebo</HEADING>
<P>Only one out of five studies showed any evidence to suggest short-term benefit from vitamin B. In this study, treatment for eight weeks improved VPT compared to placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Woelk-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Woelk 1998</LINK>). The other trials did not suggest vitamin B produced significant short-term reduction of pain intensity (<LINK REF="STD-Duque-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Duque 1994</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Woelk-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Woelk 1998</LINK>), composite impairments (<LINK REF="STD-Woelk-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Woelk 1998</LINK>), and numbness (<LINK REF="STD-Duque-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Duque 1994</LINK>), and improvement of "vibratory sensation" (<LINK REF="STD-Duque-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Duque 1994</LINK>). There was also no evidence to suggest significant benefit or harm from vitamin B treatment in long-term reduction of composite impairments (<LINK REF="STD-Yaqub-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Yaqub 1992</LINK>) and neuropathic symptoms (<LINK REF="STD-Levin-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Levin 1981</LINK>).</P>
<P>There was no evidence to suggest that vitamin B treatment produced significant short-term (<LINK REF="STD-Stracke-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Stracke 1996</LINK>) or long-term (<LINK REF="STD-Yaqub-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Yaqub 1992</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Levin-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Levin 1981</LINK>) changes in NCS parameters.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">2. Vitamin B in different doses</HEADING>
<P>There was some evidence to suggest a higher dose of vitamin B complex (thiamine and pyridoxine) given for four weeks was more efficacious than the lower dose in short-term reduction of pain, composite impairments, paraesthesiae, and composite neuropathic symptoms (<LINK REF="STD-Abbas-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Abbas 1997</LINK>). </P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">3. Vitamin B versus other substances</HEADING>
<P>Two out of three studies that compared vitamin B with alpha-lipoic acid showed evidence to suggest three to four weeks of vitamin B treatment was less efficacious than alpha-lipoic acid in producing short-term improvement of "reflex" impairment (<LINK REF="STD-Kovrazhkina-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Kovrazhkina 2004</LINK>) and reduction of composite impairments (<LINK REF="STD-Strokov-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Strokov 1999</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kovrazhkina-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Kovrazhkina 2004</LINK>). Furthermore, there was evidence to suggest vitamin B was less efficacious than cilostazol or cytidine triphosphate in short-term reduction of composite impairments after two to eight weeks of treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Hu-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Hu 2004</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Li-X-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Li X 2005</LINK>). There was also evidence to suggest vitamin B administered for eight weeks was less efficacious than cilostazol in short-term reduction of composite neuropathic symptoms (<LINK REF="STD-Hu-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Hu 2004</LINK>). There was no evidence to suggest significant benefit or harm from 16-week vitamin B treatment in long-term reduction of composite impairments (<LINK REF="STD-Zhang-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Zhang 2005</LINK>) and composite neuropathic symptoms (<LINK REF="STD-Zhang-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Zhang 2005</LINK>). </P>
<P>For NCS outcomes, two out of three studies showed evidence to suggest that three to six weeks of vitamin B treatment produced significantly less short-term improvement of NCS parameters than alpha-lipoic acid (<LINK REF="STD-Ziegler-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Ziegler 1993</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kovrazhkina-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Kovrazhkina 2004</LINK>). There was also evidence to suggest vitamin B treatment administered for eight weeks was less efficacious than cilostazol in short-term improvement of NCS parameters (<LINK REF="STD-Hu-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Hu 2004</LINK>). There was no evidence to suggest significant benefit or harm from vitamin B treatment for 16 weeks in long-term improvement of NCS parameters (<LINK REF="STD-Zhang-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Zhang 2005</LINK>). </P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Adverse effects of treatment</HEADING>
<P>There were no studies that reported serious adverse events but six out of 13 (46.15%) studies reported non-serious adverse events from treatment with either vitamin B or other substances within three months or less. The available data in all studies, however, was insufficient to determine the proportion of participants with adverse events in the specific treatment group except for one study (<LINK REF="STD-Li-X-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Li X 2005</LINK>). Only the overall proportion of participants with adverse events was reported: 13 out of 50 (26%) (<LINK REF="STD-Strokov-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Strokov 1999</LINK>), two out of 56 (3.6%) (<LINK REF="STD-Kovrazhkina-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Kovrazhkina 2004</LINK>), one out of 47 (2.1%) (<LINK REF="STD-Duque-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Duque 1994</LINK>), one out of 50 (2%) (<LINK REF="STD-Li-X-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Li X 2005</LINK>), and one out of 200 (0.5%) (<LINK REF="STD-Abbas-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Abbas 1997</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Hu-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Hu 2004</LINK> reported non-serious adverse events in the treatment group but did not indicate the number of participants involved. Overall, the reported non-serious adverse events are mild side effects from treatment except for "mild stroke" in one participant reported in the study of <LINK REF="STD-Duque-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Duque 1994</LINK> but the authors did not elaborate on the condition. There were no reported side effects from vitamin B treatment in five studies (<LINK REF="STD-Yaqub-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Yaqub 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ziegler-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Ziegler 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stracke-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Stracke 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Woelk-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Woelk 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Winkler-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Winkler 1999</LINK>). No data on adverse effects were available for two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Levin-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Levin 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zhang-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Zhang 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>Vitamins of the B family are water-soluble compounds. Excessive intake of these vitamins is generally innocuous as they are eliminated in the urine. There are few known side effects from vitamin B when given in doses based on the recommended daily requirement. There is no known toxicity even in large doses for thiamine, riboflavin, folic acid, cobalamin, and pantothenic acid. Overdose of pyridoxine can cause neurotoxicity presenting as peripheral sensory neuropathy and ataxia (<LINK REF="REF-Schaumburg-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schaumburg 1983</LINK>). Sensory neuropathy has been described in patients taking even low-dose pyridoxine for a protracted period (<LINK REF="STD-Parry-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Parry 1985</LINK>). None of the side effects pertaining to neurotoxicity from pyridoxine treatment was reported in the reviewed studies. However, pyridoxine is indicated for vitamin B deficiency, some pyridoxine-responsive anaemia, and isoniazid-induced neuropathy (<LINK REF="REF-van-Boxtel-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Boxtel 2001</LINK>). Large doses of niacin can lead to transient flushing of the skin and tingling sensation, dizziness, nausea, gastrointestinal upset, peptic ulcer disease, liver toxicity, and chemical abnormalities (<LINK REF="REF-McCarter-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">McCarter 1992</LINK>) but niacin was not included as one of the interventions for any of the trials in this systematic review.</P>

</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2008-05-14 14:54:26 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Jewitt">
<P>There are only limited data in randomised trials testing the efficacy of vitamin B for treating peripheral neuropathy and the evidence is insufficient to determine whether vitamin B is beneficial or harmful. One trial suggested that oral benfotiamine given for eight weeks was beneficial in short-term improvement of vibration detection threshold compared to placebo. Another trial suggested that four-week treatment with high doses of oral vitamin B complex (thiamine and pyridoxine) had a greater short-term beneficial effect on neuropathic symptoms and signs than low doses. These findings require confirmation. Small trials suggested that treatment with vitamin B for two to eight weeks was less efficacious than alpha-lipoic acid, cilostazol or cytidine triphosphate in short-term improvement of clinical and NCS outcomes. These also require confirmation.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2008-05-14 14:26:42 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Jewitt">
<P>The lack of evidence of short- or long-term benefit or harm from vitamin B compared to placebo or other substances may be due to genuine lack of therapeutic effect. However, several factors may have contributed to these findings, namely: (1) the doses used were below the 'therapeutic' dose, (2) the type of vitamin B compound used was not appropriate, (2) the duration of treatment and the period of observation were too short to detect therapeutic changes, and (3) the assessment tools were not sensitive enough. High quality randomised trials are needed to establish whether vitamin B is efficacious for peripheral neuropathy. Such trials need to specify the type and dose of vitamin B and the type of peripheral neuropathy.<BR/>
