<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>The liver is an important organ of the body and has various functions including generation of energy from food; production of material necessary for congealing, processing, and excretion of drugs and waste products in blood; and filtering out the harmful bacteria that enter the body through the gut. Hepatitis C virus can cause damage to the liver usually in an insidious manner (chronic hepatitis C infection). Sometimes, the liver damage can be so severe that the liver is not able to carry out the normal functions, resulting in liver failure. Liver transplantation is an effective treatment for the treatment of liver failure due to chronic hepatitis C infection. However, liver transplantation does not eradicate the virus and the virus can affect the donor liver graft. One of the proposed strategies to treat the recurrence of chronic hepatitis C virus infection in these patients is using antiviral treatments. The effectiveness of these treatments is not known. We performed a detailed review of the medical literature (to February 2013) to determine the benefits and harms of different antiviral treatments for patients with recurrent hepatitis C infection after undergoing liver transplantation for chronic hepatitis C virus infection. We sought evidence from randomised clinical trials only. When conducted properly, such trials provide the best evidence. Two authors independently identified the trials and obtained the information from the trials to minimise error.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>Eleven trials including 501 liver transplant recipients provided data for this review. The patients were randomised to receive different treatments including no treatment in these 11 trials. Long-term follow-up was not available in these trials.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>There were no significant differences in the proportion of patients who died, required retransplantation, developed graft rejection that required treatment, or increased liver damage (as evaluated using a microscope) between the groups in any of the comparisons in which these outcomes were reported. Quality of life and liver decompensation were not reported in any of the trials. There was a significantly higher proportion of participants who developed serious complications in the ribavirin plus peg interferon combination therapy compared with peg interferon monotherapy. There was no significant difference in the proportion of participants who developed serious complications or in the number of serious adverse events between the intervention and control groups in the other comparisons that reported serious complications. There is currently no evidence to recommend antiviral treatment for patients with recurrence of chronic hepatitis C virus infection either in primary liver transplantation or retransplantation.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of evidence</B>
</P>
<P>All the trials had high risk of systematic errors (that is, bias where was a potential to arrive at wrong conclusions because of the way the trials were conducted overestimating benefits and underestimating harms) and random errors (there was a potential to arrive at the wrong conclusions because of the play of chance). The overall quality of evidence was very low.</P>
<P>
<B>Future research</B>
</P>
<P>Further randomised clinical trials at low risk of random errors or systematic errors are necessary to assess the long-term survival and other benefits of various treatment options in these patients.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-11-19 17:21:31 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Dimitrinka Nikolova">
<P>Overall, 17 trials with 736 patients met the inclusion criteria for this review. All trials had high risk of bias. Five hundred and one patients randomised in 11 trials provided information for various comparisons in this systematic review after excluding post-randomisation drop-outs and patients from trials that did not report any of the outcomes of interest for this review. The comparisons for which outcomes were available included pegylated (peg) interferon versus control; peg interferon plus ribavirin versus control; ribavirin plus peg interferon versus peg interferon; peg interferon (1.5 &#956;g/kg/week) plus ribavirin versus peg interferon (0.5 &#956;g/kg/week) plus ribavirin; amantadine plus peg interferon plus ribavirin versus peg interferon plus ribavirin; interferon versus control; interferon plus ribavirin versus control; ribavirin versus interferon; and ribavirin versus placebo. Long-term follow-up was not available in these trials. There were no significant differences in mortality, retransplantation, graft rejections requiring retransplantation or medical treatment, or fibrosis worsening between the groups in any of the comparisons in which these outcomes were reported. Quality of life and liver decompensation were not reported in any of the trials. There was a significantly higher proportion of participants who developed serious adverse events in the ribavirin plus peg interferon combination therapy group than in the peg interferon monotherapy group (1 trial; 56 participants; 17/28 (60.7%) in the intervention group versus 5/28 (17.9%) in the control group; RR 3.40; 95% CI 1.46 to 7.94). There was no significant difference in proportion of participants who developed serious adverse events or in the number of serious adverse events between the intervention and control groups in the other comparisons that reported serious adverse events.</P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2013-11-28 16:26:28 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Kurinchi S Gurusamy">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2013-11-20 20:24:33 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Dimitrinka Nikolova">
<P>In the UK, the annual incidence of liver transplantation is 13 per one million population (<LINK REF="REF-NHSBT" TYPE="REFERENCE">NHSBT</LINK>). In the USA, the annual incidence of liver transplantation is 21 per one million population (<LINK REF="REF-OPTN_x002f_SRTR-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">OPTN/SRTR 2009</LINK>). Liver transplant is performed mainly for end-stage liver failure arising acutely (eg, viruses, drug overdose), or as a result of chronic liver disease (eg, cirrhosis due to alcohol consumption, viruses), or as a result of tumour (<LINK REF="REF-Lim-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lim 2006</LINK>). Liver graft can be harvested from living donors (<LINK REF="REF-Bombuy-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bombuy 2004</LINK>), or from cadavers (<LINK REF="REF-Koneru-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Koneru 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cescon-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cescon 2006</LINK>). Liver transplant can be performed in adults or children (<LINK REF="REF-Lim-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lim 2006</LINK>). Worldwide, there is a demand for liver transplants in surplus of supply. Split liver transplantation (using one cadaveric donor liver for two recipients) has been suggested as a way to decrease the organ shortage for liver transplant (<LINK REF="REF-Corno-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Corno 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>Hepatitis C viral cirrhosis is one of the main causes for liver transplantation (<LINK REF="REF-Eason-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eason 2001</LINK>). Re-infection of the liver graft is virtually universal in patients who undergo liver transplantation for hepatitis C virus infection. Immunosuppressive regimens that avoid steroids are reported to have a lower rate of graft infection with hepatitis C virus than those that include steroids as part of immunosuppressive therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Eason-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eason 2001</LINK>). Azathioprine and anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody (OKT3) are other immunosuppressive agents that can influence the severity of fibrosis following hepatitis C viral recurrence after liver transplantation (<LINK REF="REF-Berenguer-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Berenguer 2003</LINK>). The recurrence rate with hepatitis C virus is also dependent on hepatitis C subtype (with subtype Ib showing a higher recurrence rate than other subtypes) (<LINK REF="REF-Sugo-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sugo 2003</LINK>); age of the donor (<LINK REF="REF-Cameron-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cameron 2006</LINK>); age of the recipient (<LINK REF="REF-Cameron-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cameron 2006</LINK>); model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score recipient (<LINK REF="REF-Cameron-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cameron 2006</LINK>); and warm ischaemic time (<LINK REF="REF-Cameron-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cameron 2006</LINK>). Antiviral prophylaxis to prevent the recurrence of chronic hepatitis C virus infection does not seem effective (<LINK REF="REF-Gurusamy-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gurusamy 2013</LINK>).</P>
<P>Antiviral agents such as ribavirin and interferon have been used to treat hepatitis C virus re-infection in the liver grafts either alone or in combination (<LINK REF="STD-Gane-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Gane 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chalasani-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Chalasani 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Duvoux-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Duvoux 2006</LINK>). However, concerns remain about the adverse effects of these agents such as anaemia (<LINK REF="STD-Chalasani-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Chalasani 2005</LINK>), haemolysis (<LINK REF="STD-Gane-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Gane 1998</LINK>), renal failure (<LINK REF="STD-Chalasani-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Chalasani 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Duvoux-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Duvoux 2006</LINK>), depression (<LINK REF="STD-Chalasani-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Chalasani 2005</LINK>), and transplant rejection (<LINK REF="STD-Chalasani-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Chalasani 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Duvoux-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Duvoux 2006</LINK>).<BR/>
<BR/>Previous reviews have not advocated routine therapy of patients with established recurrence of hepatitis C virus infection in liver transplant recipients (<LINK REF="REF-Triantos-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Triantos 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Arjal-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Arjal 2007</LINK>). This is an update of the review published in <I>The Cochrane Library</I> Issue 1, 2010 (<LINK REF="REF-Gurusamy-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gurusamy 2010</LINK>), in which we did not recommend routine treatment of patients with established recurrence of hepatitis C virus.</P>

For dichotomous variables, we calculated the risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) in the presence of two or more trials for the outcomes. In the presence of only one trial for the outcome, we performed the Fisher's exact test using the statistical software <LINK REF="REF-StatsDirect-2.7" TYPE="REFERENCE">StatsDirect 2.7</LINK>. For continuous variables, we calculated the mean difference (MD) with 95% CI. For count data, outcomes such as serious adverse events, we calculated the rate ratio (RaR) with 95% CI using the methods shown in Section 9.4.8 of the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions </I>(<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). For such a calculation, one needs the time that the patients were exposed to the risk of serious adverse events in each of the groups. We considered that both groups were exposed to the risk of serious adverse events for the same time period, which is a reasonable assumption considering that the patients were followed up for the same time in both groups. For time-to-event outcomes, we calculated the hazard ratio with 95% CI.</P>

<P>Overall, there was no significant difference in fibrosis worsening between the intervention and control groups in any of the comparisons except for the fixed-effect model for the comparison peg interferon plus ribavirin versus no intervention control, which showed significantly lower fibrosis worsening in the peg interferon plus ribavirin group as shown above. However, on using the random-effects model, there was no significant difference between these groups as shown above. The issue of random-effects model versus fixed-effect model did not arise in the other comparisons because of the presence of only one trial in each of these comparisons. Trial sequential analysis was performed for the only comparison with at least two trials (ie, ribavirin plus peg interferon versus no intervention control). The proportion of patients recruited was only 3.1% of the DARIS and so trial sequential boundaries were not drawn.

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2013-11-20 20:38:01 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Dimitrinka Nikolova">
<P>This review has assessed the various therapies for hepatitis C virus recurrence in participants with liver transplantation. There were no significant differences in the mortality, retransplantation, or graft rejection requiring treatment in any comparison in the few trials that reported these outcomes. Quality of life and hepatic decompensation were not reported in any of the trials. The proportion of patients with serious adverse events was significantly higher in the ribavirin plus peg interferon combination therapy than peg interferon monotherapy. There was no significant difference in the proportion of patients who developed serious adverse events and the number of serious adverse events in the other comparisons in which serious adverse events were reported. These are the main clinical outcomes, which should determine whether antiviral therapy should be used for the treatment of recurrent liver graft infection with hepatitis C virus. However, the participants were followed up for only 24 to 26 weeks after the end of treatment (ie, around 17 to 18 months). Longer periods of follow-up are necessary to determine any clinical benefit.</P>
<P>Anaemia, renal impairment, and other adverse effects (such as thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, headache, insomnia, and myalgia) are frequent with antiviral treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Gurusamy-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gurusamy 2010</LINK>). Considering the lack of clinical benefit and the frequent adverse effects, there is currently no evidence to recommend antiviral treatment for recurrent liver graft infection with hepatitis C virus. Having achieved the main objective, we decided to analyse the various factors that should be taken into account if a new trial assessing the role of antiviral treatment for recurrent liver graft infection with hepatitis C virus is performed.</P>
<P>One of the important issues that should be considered before a trial assessing the role of antiviral therapy for recurrent liver graft infection with hepatitis C virus is performed is the safety of the treatment. As mentioned previously, adverse effects such as thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, or anaemia may require reduction in dose or cessation of therapy. Evidence from a randomised clinical trial showed that granulocyte colony-stimulating-factor is effective in normalising neutropenia induced by interferon plus ribavirin therapy in participants with chronic viral hepatitis (<LINK REF="REF-Sharvadze-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sharvadze 2007</LINK>). Evidence from three randomised clinical trials showed that epoetin alpha (recombinant erythropoietin) is effective in 83% to 100% of participants (with chronic hepatitis C virus infection on interferon plus ribavirin therapy) in avoiding a reduction in ribavirin dose because of anaemia (<LINK REF="REF-Dieterich-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dieterich 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Afdhal-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Afdhal 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sharvadze-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sharvadze 2006</LINK>). Use of granulocyte colony-stimulating-factor and erythropoietin may help in achieving higher cumulative doses in participants with hepatitis C virus recurrence after liver transplantation also. Multivariate analysis of case series of interferon plus ribavirin therapy in liver transplantation participants showed that the participants who attained sustained virological response (SVR) had greater cumulative doses of interferon and ribavirin than those who did not attain sustained viral response (<LINK REF="REF-Sharma-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sharma 2007</LINK>). No serious adverse effects that preclude the use of antiviral therapy were reported in any trial. There was a significant difference in the proportion of participants who achieved SVR after combination therapy with peg interferon plus ribavirin when compared with no treatment (see comparison number 2 above). Observational studies have shown that SVR after treatment is associated with reduction in mortality (<LINK REF="REF-Picciotto-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Picciotto 2007</LINK>) compared with treatment failures. While this could be because of SVR after treatment being a prognostic marker, there is also a possibility of survival benefit (by decreasing the exposure of the liver to the viral insult) if SVR was achieved. Thus, perhaps it is worth carrying out further trials of low-bias risk assessing the role of antiviral treatment for recurrent liver graft infection with hepatitis C virus. The main outcomes that need to be assessed in such trials would be mortality, retransplantation (particularly for graft failure), liver decompensation, and quality of life (to determine if the treatment improves the quality adjusted life years and to perform economic evaluation). In order to determine any difference in these outcomes, the duration and method of follow-up should be appropriate. It is expected that any difference in survival is likely to be noted only after five years. Thus, the trial should be adequately powered; it should use the appropriate methodology and outcomes; and it should include a long period of follow-up to determine the important outcomes.</P>
<P>The conductors of such trials are likely to face many problems. The first issue is the duration of the hepatitis C virus recurrence. The participants may have different stages of fibrosis in the graft. The effectiveness of the intervention may vary with the stage of fibrosis in the graft. So, the participants have to be stratified based on the stage of the fibrosis and a subgroup analysis based on the stage of fibrosis should be performed. Stratification may also have to be carried out for patient and viral factors such as genotype and the initial viral load, which may also influence the outcomes. The second issue is the choice of the experimental drug. From the trials included in this review, it appears that the combination therapy with peg interferon plus ribavirin (with the use of growth factors if necessary) offers maximum promise. However, considering the duration of recruitment (see below) and the long follow-up required for the main outcomes to be assessed, it is possible that a much superior treatment becomes available. Protocols should be in place for such an eventuality. The third issue is that of blinding the participants. Since the duration of treatment is 48 to 52 weeks and weekly injections are required for peg interferon, the blinding of the participants may be difficult. This lack of blinding will result in bias in the quality of life measures. However, the main outcomes such as mortality, retransplantation, or liver decompensation may not be affected by lack of patient blinding. The healthcare provider can be blinded by requesting the patient or a third party not involved in the trial to give the subcutaneous injections. The outcome assessors can be blinded if adequate efforts are made to achieve this. Another issue is the bias arising due to missing outcomes. Because of the long duration of follow-up required for the assessment of outcomes, adequate efforts must be made to minimise the proportion of participants lost to follow-up. Another important issue is sample size calculations. In a study based on 11,036 liver transplant recipients in the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) Scientific Registry (a database of liver transplant recipients in the USA) with a mean follow-up of 2.1 years, the actuarial five-year survival rate was 69.9% in liver transplants performed for hepatitis C virus infection as compared with that in non-hepatitis C virus participants, which was 76.6% (<LINK REF="REF-Forman-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Forman 2002</LINK>). The actuarial five-year graft survival rate was 56.8% in liver transplants performed for hepatitis C virus infections versus 67.7% in liver transplants performed for non-hepatitis C virus participants. In another retrospective study (<LINK REF="REF-Ghobrial-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ghobrial 1999</LINK>), the five-year retransplantation proportion was 76/374 (20.3%) after a median follow-up of 22.7 months. The retransplantation proportion directly related to hepatitis C virus recurrence was 3.4%. However, retransplantation rate may be a difficult outcome as there is no uniform agreement among experts regarding the criteria for retransplantation and may not be a suitable objective outcome measure. If survival is chosen as the primary outcome, the presence of hepatocellular carcinoma in the removed liver may be a confounding factor (if a significant proportion of the participants have hepatocellular carcinoma). This may necessitate two different trials or one trial with a planned subgroup analysis of participants with and without hepatocellular carcinoma. This is because of the significantly lower survival rate in participants undergoing liver transplantation for malignancy (<LINK REF="REF-Forman-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Forman 2002</LINK>). The proportion of participants undergoing liver transplantation for malignancy who had hepatocellular carcinoma is not clear from the report by <LINK REF="REF-Forman-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Forman 2002</LINK>. However, the presence of hepatocellular carcinoma prior to liver transplantation for hepatitis C may influence the survival necessitating two different trials or one trial with a planned subgroup analysis.</P>
<P>None of the trials reported whether the donors consented for organ donation. Future trials should clearly state whether donors consented for organ donation.</P>

<P>The outcomes have been divided into primary and secondary outcomes, and ordered by clinical importance. The outcomes retransplantation and graft rejection have now been clearly defined as those occurring after the start of therapy. Liver decompensation has been added as an additional primary outcome as this is an important clinical outcome that can be influenced by treatment. The outcomes initial poor function, primary graft non-function, intensive therapy unit stay, and hospital stay have been removed as these events and outcomes are prior to the start of the treatment and hence are redundant.</P>

<LI>Previously, the risk ratio in outcomes such as fibrosis improvement, where higher incidence of an event was beneficial, was entered in the same way as outcomes such as fibrosis worsening, where higher incidence of an event was harmful. This meant that the readers had to take extra care when interpreting the risk ratios. Now, the incidence of non-event has been reported in beneficial outcomes so that all risk ratios of less than one indicate benefit of the experimental intervention and risk ratios of more than one indicate harm of the experimental intervention for all the outcomes in the review.</LI>
<LI>For dichotomous variables in which there was only one trial included, we performed the Fisher's exact test. This is because of the potential for false estimates for risk ratio in <LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2008</LINK> in the presence of only one trial for the outcome.</LI>

<B>Trial Sequential Analysis of mortality (ribavirin plus peg interferon versus peg interferon)</B>
<BR/>The diversity-adjusted required information size (DARIS) was calculated to 16,594 patients, based on the proportion of patients in the control group with the outcome of 4.1%, a relative risk reduction of 20%, an alpha of 5%, a beta of 20%, and a diversity of 0%. To account for zero event groups, a continuity correction of 0.01 was used in the calculation of the cumulative Z-curve (blue line). After accruing 98 participants in two trials, only 0.59% of the DARIS has been reached. Accordingly, the Trial Sequential Analysis does not show the required information size and the trial sequential monitoring boundaries. As shown, the conventional boundaries (dotted red line) have also not been crossed by the cumulative Z-curve.</P>

<B>Trial Sequential Analysis of fibrosis worsening (ribavirin plus peg interferon versus control)</B>
<BR/>The diversity-adjusted required information size (DARIS) was calculated to 4066 patients, based on the proportion of patients in the control group with the outcome of 65.1%, a relative risk reduction of 20%, an alpha of 5%, a beta of 20%, and a diversity of 88.93%. After accruing 126 participants in two trials, only 3.1% of the DARIS has been reached. Accordingly, the Trial Sequential Analysis does not show the required information size and the trial sequential monitoring boundaries. As shown, the conventional boundaries (dotted red line) was no longer crossed by the cumulative Z-curve after two trials although the conventional boundaries were crossed after the first trial.</P>
