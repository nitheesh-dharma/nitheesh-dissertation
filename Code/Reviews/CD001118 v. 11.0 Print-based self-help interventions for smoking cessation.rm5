<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2014-05-21 15:37:24 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>We reviewed the evidence that printed materials giving structured advice about how to stop smoking help people to quit. We looked for trials of any type of printed self-help material which gave structured support and advice about quitting. We also included materials in audio or video format but we did not include internet programmes or other formats. Trials had to include people who smoked, but they did not need to be currently trying to give up. We were interested in the number of people who were not smoking at least 6 months from the time when materials were provided. Some trials mailed materials on more than one occasion. Some trials gathered information about smoking history and habits in order to provide materials which were individually tailored to the characteristics of the smoker (tailored materials). In some trials, there was no face-to-face contact, and the materials were the only support. Other trials gave everyone advice and were designed to test whether there was any additional benefit from providing written materials.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>This evidence is current to April 2014. We identified 74 studies. Most of them took place in North America or Europe and were conducted in adults. Most studies did not require that people wanted to quit smoking in order to join. Although some studies were judged to be at possible risk of bias, mainly because the papers did not report the methods in detail, this did not affect the overall conclusions from the review.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>Based on 11 studies with over 21,000 participants, there was evidence of a small benefit of printed non-tailored structured self-help materials when provided without any other contact. The likelihood of quitting was increased by about 20%. If self help was compared to even a brief pamphlet about smoking (6 studies), there was no evidence of additional benefit from structured materials. When self-help materials were provided in addition to brief face-to-face contact (5 studies) or advice (11 studies), there was no longer any evidence of additional benefit compared to the effect of contact or advice alone.</P>
<P>We found 31 trials which provided written materials that were individually tailored. Some studies compared these to no materials and some to non-tailored materials. There was evidence based on 9 studies with over 13,000 participants that tailored materials were of more benefit than no materials. There was also weaker evidence from an additional 22 studies that tailored materials were of more benefit than non-tailored materials.</P>
<P>
<B>Conclusions</B>
</P>
<P>The size of benefit from self-help materials is small, with only about 1 additional successful quitter expected from 100 people receiving materials with no other support. Studies of this type often sent materials to people who were not trying to quit, and the number of successful quitters was low. Most studies also took place in countries where more intensive support was available for people wanting to quit (for example, counselling). People were more likely to make successful quit attempts when they had face-to-face support, but in these studies giving materials did not help increase success further. People who choose to use materials may find them helpful, especially if more intensive support is not available to them, but people who want to quit should be encouraged to seek more intensive support if it is available.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Many smokers give up smoking on their own, but materials giving advice and information may help them and increase the number who quit successfully.</P>

<P>The aims of this review were to determine: the effectiveness of different forms of print-based self-help materials, compared with no treatment and with other minimal contact strategies; the effectiveness of adjuncts to print-based self help, such as computer-generated feedback, telephone hotlines and pharmacotherapy; and the effectiveness of approaches tailored to the individual compared with non-tailored materials.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2014-05-13 11:33:26 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Lindsay Stead">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group trials register. Date of the most recent search April 2014.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2014-05-20 09:31:48 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included randomized trials of smoking cessation with follow-up of at least six months, where at least one arm tested a print-based self-help intervention. We defined self help as structured programming for smokers trying to quit without intensive contact with a therapist.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2014-05-20 09:32:23 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We extracted data in duplicate on the participants, the nature of the self-help materials, the amount of face-to-face contact given to intervention and to control conditions, outcome measures, method of randomization, and completeness of follow-up.</P>
<P>The main outcome measure was abstinence from smoking after at least six months follow-up in people smoking at baseline. We used the most rigorous definition of abstinence in each trial, and biochemically validated rates when available. Where appropriate, we performed meta-analysis using a fixed-effect model.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-05-21 15:36:18 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We identified 74 trials which met the inclusion criteria. Many study reports did not include sufficient detail to judge risk of bias for some domains. Twenty-eight studies (38%) were judged at high risk of bias for one or more domains but the overall risk of bias across all included studies was judged to be moderate, and unlikely to alter the conclusions.</P>
<P>Thirty-four trials evaluated the effect of standard, non-tailored self-help materials. Pooling 11 of these trials in which there was no face-to-face contact and provision of structured self-help materials was compared to no intervention gave an estimate of benefit that just reached statistical significance (n = 13,241, risk ratio [RR] 1.19, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.04 to 1.37). This analysis excluded two trials with strongly positive outcomes that introduced significant heterogeneity. Six further trials without face-to-face contact in which the control group received alternative written materials did not show evidence for an effect of the smoking self-help materials (n = 7023, RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.04). When these two subgroups were pooled, there was no longer evidence for a benefit of standard structured materials (n = 20,264, RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.18). We failed to find evidence of benefit from providing standard self-help materials when there was brief contact with all participants (5 trials, n = 3866, RR 1.17, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.42), or face-to-face advice for all participants (11 trials, n = 5365, RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.18).</P>
<P>Thirty-one trials offered materials tailored for the characteristics of individual smokers, with controls receiving either no materials, or stage matched or non-tailored materials. Most of the trials used more than one mailing. Pooling these showed a benefit of tailored materials (n = 40,890, RR 1.28, 95% CI 1.18 to 1.37) with moderate heterogeneity (I² = 32%). The evidence is strongest for the subgroup of nine trials in which tailored materials were compared to no intervention (n = 13,437, RR 1.35, 95% CI 1.19 to 1.53), but also supports tailored materials as more helpful than standard materials. Part of this effect could be due to the additional contact or assessment required to obtain individual data, since the subgroup of 10 trials where the number of contacts was matched did not detect an effect (n = 11,024, RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.20). In two trials including a direct comparison between tailored materials and brief advice from a health care provider, there was no evidence of a difference, but confidence intervals were wide (n = 2992, RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.49).</P>
<P>Only four studies evaluated self-help materials as an adjunct to nicotine replacement therapy, with no evidence of additional benefit (n = 2291, RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.25). A small number of other trials failed to detect benefits from using additional materials or targeted materials, or to find differences between different self-help programmes.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2014-05-21 15:36:27 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Standard, print-based self-help materials increase quit rates compared to no intervention, but the effect is likely to be small. We did not find evidence that they have an additional benefit when used alongside other interventions such as advice from a healthcare professional, or nicotine replacement therapy. There is evidence that materials that are tailored for individual smokers are more effective than non-tailored materials, although the absolute size of effect is still small. Available evidence tested self-help interventions in high income countries; further research is needed to investigate their effect in contexts where more intensive support is not available.</P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2014-05-22 15:08:47 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2014-05-21 15:37:31 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The World Health Organization has identified tobacco use as the leading behavioural risk factor for preventable premature death (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2012</LINK>). Globally, tobacco smoking is currently estimated to cause the death of about five million tobacco users a year, but this is expected to rise to over eight million within the next 20 years. More than 80% of these deaths are projected to occur in low- and middle- income countries (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2012</LINK>). The adverse health effects from tobacco use include cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease and cancer.</P>
<P>Behavioural strategies to aid smoking cessation range from very brief interventions, such as advice from a physician, to intensive multi-component programmes. There is good evidence for the effectiveness of brief, therapist-delivered interventions, such as physician advice (<LINK REF="REF-Stead-2013a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stead 2013a</LINK>), and for the additional effect of more intensive behavioural interventions, such as group therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Stead-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stead 2005</LINK>), individual counselling (<LINK REF="REF-Lancaster-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lancaster 2005</LINK>) and telephone counselling (<LINK REF="REF-Stead-2013b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stead 2013b</LINK>). However, a major limitation of therapist-delivered behavioural interventions is that they reach only a small proportion of smokers. Most successful quitters give up on their own (<LINK REF="REF-Lee-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lee 2007</LINK>). Methods to support otherwise unaided quit attempts therefore have the potential to help a far greater proportion of the smoking population. This is especially the case in lower income countries, where more intensive cessation support may not be available.</P>
<P>The aim of self-help interventions is to provide some of the benefits of intensive behavioural interventions without the need to attend treatment sessions. Such materials can be disseminated and used on a much wider scale than therapist-delivered treatment. They therefore represent a bridge between the clinical approach to smoking cessation oriented towards individuals, and public health approaches that target populations (<LINK REF="REF-Curry-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Curry 1993</LINK>). Self-help programmes were first developed as written materials, primarily delivered in print, but other formats such as videos or audiotapes have also been used. New technologies enable delivery of information and support via the internet and mobile phones; these self-help formats are evaluated in separate Cochrane reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Civljak-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Civljak 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Whittaker-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Whittaker 2012</LINK>).</P>
<P>Previous reviews and versions of this review have found evidence of a small but significant effect of print-based self-help interventions. However, new theories and technologies have led to continued interest and research in this field, in particular the ability to tailor materials based on individual characteristics through computer-based algorithms. Such personalization is the focus of most new research in this field.</P>
<P>The aim of this review is to summarize existing evidence for the older (print-based, video, and audiotape) forms of self-help interventions in promoting smoking cessation.</P>

<P>We defined self-help interventions as any manual or programme to be used by individuals to assist a quit attempt not aided by health professionals, counsellors or group support. This review primarily covers written materials, but information could also have been provided via audio or videotape or similar medium. Interventions designed to be delivered via the internet, or via mobile phone, are covered in separate reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Civljak-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Civljak 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Whittaker-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Whittaker 2012</LINK>). Materials could be aimed at smokers in general, could target particular populations of smokers, for example different ages or ethnic groups, or could be tailored to individual smoker characteristics. Brief leaflets on the health effects of smoking were not included - they were considered to be a control intervention if compared to a more substantial manual. Interventions with a single session of minimal face-to-face contact for the purpose of supplying the self-help programme materials were regarded as self help alone. Where a face-to-face meeting included discussion of the programme contents we categorized this as brief advice in addition to self-help materials. We excluded interventions that provided repeated sessions of advice in addition to self-help materials. Telephone counselling or hotlines as adjuncts to self-help materials are covered in a separate Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-Stead-2013b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stead 2013b</LINK>).</P>

<SEARCH_METHODS MODIFIED="2014-05-20 11:29:27 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We identified trials included in previous reviews and meta-analyses, and searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Review Group Specialized Register of controlled trials for additional studies, using the terms 'self-help', 'manual*' or 'booklet*' or pamphlet* in the title or abstract, or as a keyword (<LINK REF="APP-01" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 1</LINK>). The most recent search of the Register was in April 2014. At the time of the search the Register included the results of searches of: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled trials (CENTRAL), issue 3, 2014; MEDLINE (via OVID) to update 20140321; EMBASE (via OVID) to week 201413 and PsycINFO (via OVID) to update 20140317.

<DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2014-05-21 15:38:56 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two authors extracted data. Information extracted included details of the intervention, population recruited, method of randomization, completeness of follow-up, way in which cessation was defined and whether self-reported cessation was validated.</P>
<P>We summarized individual study results as a risk ratio, calculated as: (number of quitters in intervention group/ number randomized to intervention group) / (number of quitters in control group/ number randomized to control group). Where appropriate we performed meta-analysis using a Mantel-Haenszel fixed-effect method to estimate a pooled risk ratio with 95% confidence intervals (<LINK REF="REF-Greenland-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Greenland 1985</LINK>). The amount of statistical heterogeneity between trials was estimated using the I² statistic (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2003</LINK>). Values between 30 to 60% may suggest moderate heterogeneity, and values over 75% represent considerable heterogeneity (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>We categorized trials according to the amount of face-to-face contact provided to both treatment and comparison intervention groups, according to whether or not any written materials were given to the comparison group, and according to whether the material was individually tailored.

<P>We define as tailored materials those that make use of participant characteristics to provide individualized programmes. We also include in this category interventions providing individual written feedback in addition to standard materials. We define targeted materials as those tailored for a broadly defined category of smoker, for example, women with young children, older smokers, or smokers in a particular stage of change (<LINK REF="REF-Kreuter-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kreuter 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>The use of proactive telephone counselling or provision of telephone hotlines as an adjunct to self-help materials is now evaluated in a separate Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-Stead-2013b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stead 2013b</LINK>), so trials which only compare these interventions are no longer included here.</P>

<P>For the present update of the review we identified 285 potentially relevant records new to the Tobacco Addiction Group Specialised Register since the last update; six new studies met the inclusion criteria (<LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>). The review now includes 74 trials of self-help methods. One study with a factorial design was treated as two studies for data entry (<LINK REF="STD-Killen-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Killen 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Killen-1997-_x002b_NP" TYPE="STUDY">Killen 1997 +NP</LINK>). Thirty-four of the included studies compared standard self-help materials to no intervention or provided standard materials as an adjunct to advice. The other trials compared targeted or tailored self-help methods or compared other variations of programmes. Some trials used multiple interventions, testing the effect of different types of information, or the effect of increasing amounts of material. Trials of self-help materials were carried out in a range of settings. In some the materials were provided without face-to-face contact or any additional motivating strategy. Some studies tested the use of materials for people who had called quitlines; self-help materials were the main form of support offered, or were evaluated as an adjunct to counselling (<LINK REF="STD-Strecher-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Strecher 2005</LINK>). In healthcare settings, self-help materials were more frequently used as an adjunct to brief advice to quit. Some studies described as being tests of self-help materials included relatively high levels of face-to-face support, though less than in formal counselling programmes. The smokers recruited to trials ranged from those who had already succeeded in quitting for 48 hours (<LINK REF="STD-Killen-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Killen 1990</LINK>), to those with no interest in quitting (<LINK REF="STD-Dijkstra-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Dijkstra 1999</LINK>), but in most cases an interest in quitting was not a selection criterion.</P>
<P>The content and format of the self-help programmes were varied. The most frequently used approach was the American Lung Association (ALA) <I>Freedom from smoking in 20 days</I> cessation manual and <I>A lifetime of freedom from smoking</I> maintenance manual. Most other programmes were not named or described fully. Materials have tended to become more complex over time and to incorporate more techniques from behaviour therapy approaches. Most recent studies have used computerized expert systems to provide tailored materials judged to be relevant to the characteristics of each smoker, using baseline data. We specified that materials should contain a structured programme for quitting. When it was not clear whether the materials provided met these criteria, we performed sensitivity analysis to determine the effect of including or excluding these trials.</P>
<P>Further details on each of the included studies can be found in the <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK> table. Details of 73 studies excluded at full text stage can be found in the <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_EXCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of excluded studies</LINK> table. The most common reasons for listing studies as excluded were that self-help materials were used as the control and that follow-up was too short, typically only one month.</P>

<P>We identified 19 trials in which non-tailored self-help materials were sent to smokers without any personal contact. In 13 of these the comparison control group was not sent any materials (<LINK REF="STD-Cuckle-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Cuckle 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ledwith-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Ledwith 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lando-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Lando 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gritz-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Gritz 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pallonen-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Pallonen 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Curry-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Curry 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Humerfelt-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Humerfelt 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dijkstra-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Dijkstra 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schofield-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Schofield 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Becona-2001a" TYPE="STUDY">Becona 2001a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Becona-2001b" TYPE="STUDY">Becona 2001b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lennox-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Lennox 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Willemsen-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Willemsen 2006</LINK>). In the other six the control group received a brief leaflet (<LINK REF="STD-Davis-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Davis 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cummings-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Cummings 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Orleans-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Orleans 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lichtenstein-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Lichtenstein 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lichtenstein-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Lichtenstein 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Parekh-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Parekh 2014</LINK>). In 11 trials, participants responded to promotion of smoking cessation programmes or volunteered for a trial. One of these only recruited smokers who were not planning to quit in the next six months (<LINK REF="STD-Dijkstra-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Dijkstra 1999</LINK>). Two studies sent unsolicited materials to smokers in Health Maintenance Organisations (<LINK REF="STD-Curry-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Curry 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gritz-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Gritz 1992</LINK>). One sent either tailored or non-tailored letters from a physician to general practice patients who had answered a questionnaire about smoking behaviour (<LINK REF="STD-Lennox-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Lennox 2001</LINK>); we compare the standard letter to the non-intervention control in this comparison. One study addressed smoking, diet, physical activity and weight so only a subgroup of participants smoked; the control group received information on other health behaviours (<LINK REF="STD-Parekh-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Parekh 2014</LINK>). One study sent a booklet and a personally addressed letter from a consultant to smokers or recent quitters discharged from hospital (<LINK REF="STD-Schofield-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Schofield 1999</LINK>). Three studies targeted factors which might motivate interest in quitting. One of these used a community survey to identify young (30-45) male smokers with reduced FEV1 or asbestos exposure. The intervention consisted of self-help materials accompanied by a letter from a respiratory physician, which drew attention to the individual's higher risk of smoking-related lung disease and advised quitting (<LINK REF="STD-Humerfelt-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Humerfelt 1998</LINK>). The other two recruited households via utility bill enclosure offering radon testing, and provided a leaflet (<LINK REF="STD-Lichtenstein-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Lichtenstein 2000</LINK>) or video (<LINK REF="STD-Lichtenstein-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Lichtenstein 2008</LINK>) that highlighted the synergistic impact of radon and smoking and advised on quitting or not smoking indoors. The comparison groups received a standard leaflet about the risks of radon that did not emphasise quitting. All the studies used a single mailing of materials except <LINK REF="STD-Becona-2001a" TYPE="STUDY">Becona 2001a</LINK> and one arm of <LINK REF="STD-Becona-2001b" TYPE="STUDY">Becona 2001b</LINK> which sent six weekly mailings, <LINK REF="STD-Pallonen-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Pallonen 1994</LINK> which sent stage of change-based manuals at six-monthly intervals, and <LINK REF="STD-Parekh-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Parekh 2014</LINK> in which one intervention arm received a second assessment and mailing after three months.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Non-tailored materials with brief contact</HEADING>
<P>We identified five trials in which non-tailored self-help materials were given personally to participants, but not in the context of formal advice to stop smoking. In one study the control group were given health education materials without a specific focus on tobacco use, and the intervention group was intended to receive a single telephone call (<LINK REF="STD-Resnicow-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Resnicow 1997</LINK>). In the other studies the controls received no intervention (<LINK REF="STD-Prue-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Prue 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Campbell-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Campbell 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fortmann-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Fortmann 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Betson-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Betson 1998</LINK>). Three studies recruited in outpatient clinics (<LINK REF="STD-Prue-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Prue 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Campbell-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Campbell 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Betson-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Betson 1998</LINK>); the last of these probably included some telephone contact for the self-help group, although the extent of this is unclear. In one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Fortmann-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Fortmann 1995</LINK>) volunteers were recruited who had quit for 24 hours before randomization in a factorial design with a nicotine gum/no gum condition. Since there was no interaction between the gum and self-help conditions the nicotine arms have been collapsed for entry in the analysis. All these participants were offered a US$100 incentive to quit for six months.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Non-tailored materials and advice versus advice alone</HEADING>
<P>Eleven trials assessed non-tailored self-help materials as an adjunct to brief advice about stopping smoking given by a healthcare worker. In three of these trials some written materials were given to the control group. In one study (<LINK REF="STD-Lando-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Lando 1988</LINK>) both arms were also prescribed nicotine gum and instructed in its use. Advice was given by a doctor alone in six studies, and by a doctor, nurse or both in four. In one study student nurses advised two smokers each, one before and one after training to deliver a self-help manual (<LINK REF="STD-Davies-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Davies 1992</LINK>). In one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Hollis-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Hollis 1993</LINK>) self-help participants had additional advice from a nurse as well as a physician message. In a study of physician advice (<LINK REF="STD-Thompson-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Thompson 1988</LINK>) which used a complete factorial design some smokers received structured advice with or without materials, and some received brief advice - we have combined the two levels of advice. <LINK REF="STD-Kottke-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Kottke 1989</LINK> randomized physicians to a workshop with or without a supply of self-help materials for patients.</P>
<P>We did not identify any trials that directly compared standard self-help materials with brief advice.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Tailored self-help materials (Comparisons 3 &amp; 4)</HEADING>
<P>Thirty-one trials used materials tailored according to the characteristics of individual smokers. Only two of these had any face-to-face contact as part of the baseline intervention (<LINK REF="STD-Lipkus-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Lipkus 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Meyer-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Meyer 2012</LINK>). Four recruited people who had called a quitline. In <LINK REF="STD-Borland-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Borland 2003</LINK> only those callers seeking written materials without counselling were recruited. In <LINK REF="STD-Borland-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Borland 2004</LINK> some had brief counselling prior to recruitment, and in <LINK REF="STD-Strecher-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Strecher 2005</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Sutton-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Sutton 2007</LINK> all participants received counselling during their initial call. Just under half the remaining studies included volunteers who were likely to have been seeking help to quit. Fifteen recruited a mix of people, some of whom were not interested in immediate quit attempts (<LINK REF="STD-Curry-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Curry 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Velicer-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Velicer 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lennox-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Lennox 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Prochaska-2001a" TYPE="STUDY">Prochaska 2001a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Prochaska-2001b" TYPE="STUDY">Prochaska 2001b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Aveyard-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Aveyard 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Etter-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Etter 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Prochaska-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Prochaska 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Prochaska-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Prochaska 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-de-Vries-2008" TYPE="STUDY">de Vries 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schumann-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Schumann 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Meyer-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Meyer 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-van-der-Aalst-2012" TYPE="STUDY">van der Aalst 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gilbert-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Gilbert 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Parekh-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Parekh 2014</LINK>), and one trial specifically recruited people not interested in quitting (<LINK REF="STD-Dijkstra-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Dijkstra 1999</LINK>). Four trials evaluated multiple risk factor interventions so only a subgroup of participants were smokers (<LINK REF="STD-Prochaska-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Prochaska 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Prochaska-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Prochaska 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-de-Vries-2008" TYPE="STUDY">de Vries 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Parekh-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Parekh 2014</LINK>).</P>
<P>Nine studies compared tailored materials to no intervention (<LINK REF="STD-Dijkstra-1998b" TYPE="STUDY">Dijkstra 1998b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Prochaska-2001a" TYPE="STUDY">Prochaska 2001a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Prochaska-2001b" TYPE="STUDY">Prochaska 2001b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Etter-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Etter 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Prochaska-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Prochaska 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Prochaska-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Prochaska 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Meyer-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Meyer 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schumann-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Schumann 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hoving-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Hoving 2010</LINK>). Some of the 19 trials testing the incremental effect of tailoring over standard materials confounded the tailoring with additional contact, so we grouped the trials according to whether or not the number of mailings was matched. Ten trials matched contacts (<LINK REF="STD-Burling-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Burling 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Owen-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Owen 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Velicer-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Velicer 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Becona-2001a" TYPE="STUDY">Becona 2001a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lennox-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Lennox 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Strecher-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Strecher 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Velicer-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Velicer 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sutton-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Sutton 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-de-Vries-2008" TYPE="STUDY">de Vries 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-van-der-Aalst-2012" TYPE="STUDY">van der Aalst 2012</LINK>). Of the trials with additional contact, some provided the same materials initially but then provided additional tailored materials to the intervention group, so we distinguished between six where all materials were tailored (<LINK REF="STD-Curry-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Curry 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Prochaska-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Prochaska 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Curry-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Curry 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Aveyard-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Aveyard 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Borland-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Borland 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gilbert-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Gilbert 2013</LINK>) and three where materials were only partially tailored (<LINK REF="STD-Ledwith-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Ledwith 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dijkstra-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Dijkstra 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Borland-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Borland 2004</LINK>). Two studies tested tailored materials as an adjunct to advice (<LINK REF="STD-Lipkus-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Lipkus 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Meyer-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Meyer 2012</LINK>). One study compared a placebo tailored intervention (tailoring was not actually conducted, but materials were constructed to suggest it had been) with a standard, non-tailored intervention (<LINK REF="STD-Webb-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Webb 2013</LINK>).</P>
<P>The method used for obtaining information, the theoretical basis for tailoring materials and the number of contacts varied, and are reported in more detail in the <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK> table. Eleven studies tailored materials based only on information provided at baseline (<LINK REF="STD-Ledwith-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Ledwith 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Owen-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Owen 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Curry-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Curry 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dijkstra-1998a" TYPE="STUDY">Dijkstra 1998a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lennox-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Lennox 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Aveyard-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Aveyard 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Strecher-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Strecher 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sutton-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Sutton 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-de-Vries-2008" TYPE="STUDY">de Vries 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hoving-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Hoving 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-van-der-Aalst-2012" TYPE="STUDY">van der Aalst 2012</LINK>), whereas the others sent further materials based on further assessments. Of those interventions that reported the theoretical basis for their tailoring, stage of change was by far the most common model used, with 14 interventions modelling material on this theory (<LINK REF="STD-Pederson-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Pederson 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Velicer-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Velicer 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lennox-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Lennox 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Prochaska-2001a" TYPE="STUDY">Prochaska 2001a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Prochaska-2001b" TYPE="STUDY">Prochaska 2001b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Aveyard-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Aveyard 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Borland-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Borland 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Etter-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Etter 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Prochaska-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Prochaska 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Prochaska-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Prochaska 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Velicer-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Velicer 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Meyer-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Meyer 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schumann-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Schumann 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Meyer-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Meyer 2012</LINK>). One study tailored materials based on social cognitive and perspectives of change theories (<LINK REF="STD-Sutton-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Sutton 2007</LINK>) and two based their intervention on the I-Change model (<LINK REF="STD-Dijkstra-1998a" TYPE="STUDY">Dijkstra 1998a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hoving-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Hoving 2010</LINK>).

Both have been included in the relevant subgroup of the comparisons above, but are also compared directly here. Both studies used nicotine gum. We excluded a further study from this comparison because both groups received written materials, which we classified as self help (<LINK REF="STD-ICRF-1994" TYPE="STUDY">ICRF 1994</LINK>).</P>
<P>Two studies tested tailored/targeted self-help materials as an adjunct to NRT. One study, published as an abstract (<LINK REF="STD-Orleans-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Orleans 2000</LINK>), used a guide targeted for older smokers and seven age-tailored computer-generated mailings as an adjunct to nicotine patch.

The control group received no further intervention. The self-selecting group then chose a further seven modules on avoiding smoking in specific high-risk situations. The final group were sent a random selection of modules at weekly intervals. These factors were crossed with a nicotine gum or placebo condition. Since no interaction was reported we have collapsed the gum conditions and combined the self-selected and random module groups. Another trial compared a Quit Kit with five-day cessation plan against a staged correspondence course (<LINK REF="STD-Owen-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Owen 1989</LINK>). In the third, the American Lung Association (ALA) <I>Freedom from smoking in 20 days</I> manual used in conjunction with a televised programme and additional maintenance newsletters was compared to manual and programme alone (<LINK REF="STD-McFall-1993" TYPE="STUDY">McFall 1993</LINK>).

<P>We identified eight trials that compared different types of self-help materials that were neither tailored nor personalized, or delivered over different time periods (<LINK REF="STD-Glasgow-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Glasgow 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Omenn-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Omenn 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-ICRF-1994" TYPE="STUDY">ICRF 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Berman-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Berman 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Becona-2001b" TYPE="STUDY">Becona 2001b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sykes-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Sykes 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Clark-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Clark 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Smith-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 2004</LINK>).

The majority of studies did not explicitly describe the way in which the randomization sequence was generated or concealed until patient enrolment. In many of the studies there was no face-to-face contact with participants and the likelihood of biased allocation was probably low. In four studies (<LINK REF="STD-Campbell-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Campbell 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pederson-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Pederson 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Davis-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Davis 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Meyer-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Meyer 2008</LINK>) a pseudo-random method of allocation by day or week of attendance was used, and one study (<LINK REF="STD-Hollis-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Hollis 1993</LINK>) used numbers in the patient record. One study shuffled questionnaires (<LINK REF="STD-Borland-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Borland 2003</LINK>) and another used the pre-printed colour on the questionnaire to determine allocation (<LINK REF="STD-Hoving-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Hoving 2010</LINK>). One study randomized physicians to intervention groups (<LINK REF="STD-Kottke-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Kottke 1989</LINK>) and two randomized households (<LINK REF="STD-Lichtenstein-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Lichtenstein 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lichtenstein-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Lichtenstein 2008</LINK>).

In some of these studies we judged that the method of generating the allocation could have led to selection bias in the recruitment or assignment of patients.

<P>In this update, we assessed performance and detection bias based on blinding of participants and personnel and on whether biochemical validation was used. Forty-two studies provided detail of blinding, biochemical validation and/or description of similar intensity interventions that led us to judge them to be at low risk of bias in this domain.

<P>Some reports give quit rates based only on those people contacted at follow-up. In this review we have followed the methods of the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Review Group in reporting analyses based on the total number randomized wherever possible, with drop-outs and participants lost to follow-up classified as smokers. In population-based studies it has been argued that it may be pessimistic, and introduce bias, to classify all drop-outs as continuing smokers if those data are missing at random (<LINK REF="STD-Velicer-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Velicer 1999</LINK>). We have noted in the Risk of Bias table the number of drop-outs by group, and whether the data used in this review included all randomized participants. Where the proportion of drop-outs was high and differed across treatment conditions we performed sensitivity analyses to assess whether excluding drop-outs would affect the conclusions. It should be noted that if the proportion of drop-outs is similar across conditions, including losses as treatment failures does not affect the risk ratio. The large majority of included studies reported sufficiently similar losses to follow-up across arms that we judged them to be at low risk of attrition bias. Fourteen did not provide sufficient detail with which to judge, and three reported data on loss to follow-up that led us to place the study at high risk of bias in this domain: one in which less than half of participants were followed up (<LINK REF="STD-Nollen-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Nollen 2007</LINK>); one in which loss to follow-up was differential (41% difference) between intervention and control arms (<LINK REF="STD-Cuckle-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Cuckle 1984</LINK>); and one in which only participants who provided data at final follow-up were reported in the paper (<LINK REF="STD-de-Vries-2008" TYPE="STUDY">de Vries 2008</LINK>).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Measures of abstinence</HEADING>
<P>Studies reported a range of measures of abstinence. A minimum period of follow-up of six months was required for inclusion in the review, but 47/74 (63.5%) followed up participants for 12 months or more. Thirty-three of these required abstinence to have been sustained for a period. Trials that used strict criteria for self-reported sustained abstinence, with validation at one or more follow-up points, tended to report lower quit rates for both experimental and comparison interventions. In minimal contact programmes, obtaining saliva samples for biochemical validation was often reported to be a problem. Participants may have declined to provide samples for reasons unrelated to their smoking status. Validated quit rates may therefore be particularly low, and are likely to underestimate success rates if all those for whom samples are not available are classified as smokers. Measures using abstinence from the first follow-up may underestimate the long-term effect of having access to the self-help materials, which may prompt a quit attempt some time after they were supplied. Trials with long follow-up which only use point prevalence abstinence rates may show a trend of increasing quit rates as more smokers make attempts over time.</P>

<P>Trials varied in the amount of face-to-face advice or counselling given to both experimental and comparison interventions, and in whether or not control materials were given to smokers in the comparison group. In considering the effects of self help, we grouped trials by these categories. In Comparison 1 we calculated a pooled risk ratio (RR) separately for each level of personal contact with subgroups for the type of control. In Comparison 2 we used the same trial data and pooled all subgroups in order to estimate an overall pooled RR from all trials comparing self help to no self help.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Non-tailored materials without face-to-face contact</HEADING>
<P>There were 13 trials with a total of over 15,500 participants where standard non-tailored self-help manuals or materials were provided by post, and control groups did not receive any materials. There was substantial heterogeneity (I² = 71%) attributable to the inclusion of two trials conducted in Spain (<LINK REF="STD-Becona-2001a" TYPE="STUDY">Becona 2001a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Becona-2001b" TYPE="STUDY">Becona 2001b</LINK>) that showed very strong effects (<LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>). Both trials enrolled treatment-seeking smokers, and those in the control group knew they would be offered treatment after six months, a possible disincentive to make an unaided quit attempt. Quit rates were also very high in the intervention groups (16% and 25%). We have therefore excluded these studies from this meta-analysis and calculated a pooled estimated effect for the other 11 trials amongst which there was no evidence of heterogeneity (I² = 0%). Amongst these trials the control quit rate ranged from 1% to 11%, with an average of 5%, and the intervention quit rate ranged from 2% to 10%. The pooled risk ratio favoured self-help interventions, although the confidence interval (CI) only narrowly excluded 1.0 (n = 13,241, risk ratio (RR) 1.19, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.37, <LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>.1/ 2.1.1).</P>
<P>Six trials in which the controls received some form of written materials did not show any trend towards a benefit of more structured materials, with the pooled risk ratio for this subgroup being less than 1.0 (n = 7023, RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.04, <LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>.2/ 2.1.2).

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Non-tailored materials with brief contact</HEADING>
<P>In the group of five trials in which the materials were delivered in person rather than by post there were almost 4000 participants, and an average control group quit rate of 9%. There was no evidence of heterogeneity and we failed to find evidence for a significant effect of self-help materials given with face-to-face contact whether or not controls received some written materials (n = 3866, RR 1.17, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.42, <LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>).</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Non-tailored materials and advice versus advice alone</HEADING>
<P>There were 11 trials with a total of over 5,000 participants in which self-help materials were tested as an adjunct to face-to-face advice from a healthcare provider. There was little heterogeneity and we did not find evidence that the additional self-help materials significantly increased quit rates (n = 5365, RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.18, <LINK REF="CMP-001.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.4</LINK>). Whether or not the control group received materials did not affect the estimate. The control group quit rates ranged from 2% to 25% with an average of 7%. As would be expected, this is higher than the rates seen in control groups that received no intervention.</P>

<P>When we pooled 32 trials of self-help materials compared to no self help, irrespective of level of contact and support common to the control group, there was no evidence of an effect and little heterogeneity (n = 29,495, RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.16, I² = 23%, <LINK REF="CMP-002.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.1</LINK>, <LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK>). (Note: the estimate excludes <LINK REF="STD-Becona-2001a" TYPE="STUDY">Becona 2001a</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Becona-2001b" TYPE="STUDY">Becona 2001b</LINK>, and <LINK REF="STD-Betson-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Betson 1998</LINK> contributes data to two subgroups.)</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Tailored self-help materials (Comparisons 3 &amp; 4)</HEADING>
<P>Based on nine studies, participants receiving tailored self-help materials had higher quit rates than those receiving no materials at all (n = 13,437, RR 1.35, 95% CI 1.19 to 1.53, I² = 0%, <LINK REF="CMP-003.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.1</LINK>.1). Control group quit rates were 4 to 7%. Estimates were largely based on sustained but self-reported abstinence with the exception of <LINK REF="STD-Prochaska-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Prochaska 2005</LINK>, which only reported point prevalence quit rates.</P>
<P>In other trials of tailored materials the control groups received standard self-help materials. The subgroup of ten trials in which the intervention and control groups were matched for number of contacts did not detect a benefit (n = 11,024, RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.20) with some evidence of heterogeneity (I² = 50%), largely contributed by <LINK REF="STD-Becona-2001a" TYPE="STUDY">Becona 2001a</LINK> where there was a significant effect of weekly feedback reports. One trial (<LINK REF="STD-Sutton-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Sutton 2007</LINK>) included some recent quitters for whom the effect of intervention was smaller, but restricting inclusion to those still smoking at enrolment had little impact on the pooled estimate. <LINK REF="STD-Velicer-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Velicer 1999</LINK> showed an almost significant effect based on numbers randomized. Excluding drop-outs from the denominators increased the estimated effect a little because more people were lost from the expert system intervention groups. This trial also tested different numbers of tailored versus non-tailored mailings, but did not detect a consistent dose response effect (data not shown).</P>
<P>Amongst the six studies where tailored materials were compared to a non-tailored control, but with the effect potentially confounded by the increased contact, results were consistent. Although none of these studies individually had statistically significant results, the pooled estimate suggested a small benefit of the intervention (n = 11,379, RR 1.32, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.61, <LINK REF="CMP-003.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.1</LINK>.3). In the group of three studies where only the additional materials were tailored, there was also evidence of benefit (n = 2787, RR 1.72, 95% CI 1.25 to 2.37, <LINK REF="CMP-003.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.1</LINK>.4). Two studies that tested tailored materials as an adjunct to physician advice detected a benefit of the materials (n = 1839, RR 1.68, 95% CI 1.19 to 2.37, <LINK REF="CMP-003.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.1</LINK>.5).</P>
<P>One study (<LINK REF="STD-Webb-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Webb 2013</LINK>) detected a benefit of 'placebo tailoring' (n = 424, RR 1.98, 95% CI 1.18 to 3.31), suggesting that the actual content of the tailored message may be less important than the perception that it is individualised.</P>
<P>If the differences in the details of tailoring and amount of contact are taken to be of limited importance, and all 31 studies are pooled, there is only modest statistical heterogeneity (I² = 32%) and there is evidence of an overall benefit from tailored materials (n = 40,890, RR 1.28, 95% CI 1.18 to 1.37, <LINK REF="CMP-003.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.1</LINK>, <LINK REF="FIG-04" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 4</LINK>). The estimate remains almost unchanged if we exclude the nine trials in Analysis 3.1.1 where there was a no-intervention control (n = 27,453, RR 1.24, 95% CI 1.13 to 1.36, I² = 48%). Additional sensitivity analysis removing the study using placebo tailoring makes little difference to either result. This supports a conclusion both that tailored materials increase the number of quitters and that they do so more than standard materials.</P>

The control group quit rate was over 20% in three of the four studies. There was no difference in results between the two trials using standard materials and the two that tailored materials. One study relevant to this category was excluded because follow-up was too short (<LINK REF="STD-Strecher-2005b" TYPE="STUDY">Strecher 2005b</LINK>). This study compared an internet-based tailored programme to internet-based non-tailored material for smokers who had purchased nicotine patch and logged on to use the behavioural support programme.

In two of the studies, callers to quitlines were given telephone counselling before being sent materials (<LINK REF="STD-Davis-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Davis 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Orleans-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Orleans 1998</LINK> (in which the counselling was also tailored)), and in one, all participants received nicotine replacement therapy (<LINK REF="STD-Nollen-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Nollen 2007</LINK>). These common components may have contributed to the success in quitting in all groups and limited the potential to detect effects of small differences in adjunct materials.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Comparisons between different types of self-help material</HEADING>
<P>We did not perform meta-analysis of this heterogeneous group of trials. Two small trials each compared three variants of materials (<LINK REF="STD-Glasgow-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Glasgow 1981</LINK>, n = 88; <LINK REF="STD-Omenn-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Omenn 1988</LINK>, n = 243); neither detected statistical differences in quit rates between any conditions. A trial with 1686 participants also found no significant difference in outcome between those given a longer or a shorter booklet when used in conjunction with either a nicotine or placebo patch and nurse support (<LINK REF="STD-ICRF-1994" TYPE="STUDY">ICRF 1994</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Berman-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Berman 1995</LINK> compared two types of materials for 348 smokers volunteering for heart health screening and cessation. There were no significant differences in any measure of quitting. <LINK REF="STD-Clark-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Clark 2004</LINK> (n = 171) did not detect the hypothesized benefit of a list of internet resources over standard material. The results favoured the standard materials but with wide confidence intervals. A study comparing weekly mailings to a single manual detected no significant difference at six or 12 months (<LINK REF="STD-Becona-2001b" TYPE="STUDY">Becona 2001b</LINK>, n = 482). There was no evidence of a difference between a 44-page booklet or a pamphlet when used as adjuncts for motivated quitters receiving an extended telephone counselling session and one of two intensities of follow-up counselling (<LINK REF="STD-Smith-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 2004</LINK>, n = 632). One trial (<LINK REF="STD-Sykes-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Sykes 2001</LINK>, n = 260) showed a statistically significant effect after six months with a more than three-fold increase in the odds of quitting using a cognitive behavioural self-help programme compared to a standard leaflet, with both used as an adjunct to a single introductory session in a group format. This was not sustained at 12-month follow-up (<LINK REF="REF-Marks-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marks 2002</LINK>).</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Summary of main results: self help in different contexts</HEADING>
<P>In this review, we defined self-help materials as those providing structured approaches to smoking cessation. Using this definition, there was moderate evidence that such materials, used on their own and compared with no intervention, marginally but significantly increased the number of people able to quit smoking (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>). The confidence in this result was somewhat limited by potential risk of bias due to inadequate reporting, but this was judged to be unlikely to affect confidence in the direction of the effect.</P>
<P>In trials in which mailed materials were compared with a no-intervention control, the quit rate increased by 20%. This result just reached statistical significance as the confidence interval around this estimate just excluded 1.0. The results of most of these trials were reasonably consistent, but we excluded two trials (both by the same authors) from the pooled estimate because they were the source of significant heterogeneity: these two trials showed benefits for self-help materials. None of the other trials had significant results for the outcome used in this review. While it is probable that there was a small effect of the materials compared to no treatment, this corresponds to an absolute difference in quit rates of about 1% at best (Number needed to treat = 100). This effect was lost if we included trials where controls received some alternative written materials about the health effects of smoking.</P>
<P>There was no evidence of a significant effect when the materials were handed out with face-to-face contact but without advice about smoking cessation. In this comparison there were four trials without, and one with, materials for the control group. The trial contributing the greatest weight (<LINK REF="STD-Fortmann-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Fortmann 1995</LINK>) only included smokers who had successfully quit for 24 hours, and where some smokers were additionally receiving nicotine gum - excluding gum groups did not affect the summary outcome. However this trial design was testing the effectiveness of self-help materials in preventing relapse, not in motivating a quit attempt or aiding immediate success.</P>
<P>Another Cochrane systematic review has shown that physician advice increases quitting compared to no advice or usual care (<LINK REF="REF-Stead-2013a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stead 2013a</LINK>). The present review suggests that providing additional self-help materials in addition to advice from a healthcare professional does not improve the outcome. This set of comparisons includes 11 trials with over 5000 participants. The upper limit of the 95% confidence interval for the pooled estimate of an effect is a risk ratio of 1.18, but when calculated as an absolute difference, the increase in quit rates would be no more than 1%. Russell's widely quoted study of the effects of advice from doctors in primary care (<LINK REF="STD-Russell-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Russell 1979</LINK>), suggested that the addition of a leaflet along with a warning of follow-up produced an incremental benefit. This effect was not consistently replicated in later studies. Russell's trial was not included in the present review, as the information leaflet was not substantial enough to qualify as self help. However, its inclusion in a sensitivity analysis did not alter the conclusions.</P>
<P>There is similarly little evidence of an effect for self-help materials in addition to nicotine replacement therapy (NRT). There have been other trials using personally tailored materials instead of standard materials combined with nicotine gum or patch (<LINK REF="STD-Shiffman-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Shiffman 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shiffman-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Shiffman 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Strecher-2005b" TYPE="STUDY">Strecher 2005b</LINK>). They report only short follow-up and are therefore not included in this review, but combining tailored materials with NRT may be a promising field for further research.</P>
<P>One reason that it may be difficult to show efficacy for standard self-help programmes is the level of 'contamination'. Materials encouraging smokers to quit and giving tips are already relatively widely disseminated, so that smokers in a control arm who are motivated to try to give up may well have access to the same kinds of materials that experimental group smokers have been given. On the other hand, there may be more fundamental reasons why behavioural interventions are more effective when delivered by face-to-face contact. Killen has suggested, for example, that the self-regulatory skills required to withstand the urge to smoke may be better learnt, rehearsed and retained under direct supervision from a therapist than through the simple modelling offered by self-help materials (<LINK REF="STD-Killen-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Killen 1997</LINK>). Strecher has suggested that the length of generic self-help manuals and pamphlets may discourage effective use of materials (<LINK REF="STD-Strecher-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Strecher 1994</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Meade-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Meade 1989</LINK> suggested that self-help materials may be too advanced for many readers and that comprehension can be improved by adjustment of the reading grade level. Tailored materials may have the potential to address these issues.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Enhancing self-help programmes</HEADING>
<P>One of the main criticisms of traditional self-help materials is that they do not take account of individual characteristics and problems in dealing with smoking cessation. This could account for the failure of self-help materials to match the effect of counselling delivered individually or in groups. Tailoring materials to individuals' habits and motivations is an attractive theoretical approach to enhancing the efficacy of such materials. In this review, individually tailored materials appeared to be effective compared to no self-help intervention. One limitation of the conclusions on the benefit of tailoring compared to standard materials is that in a number of studies the tailoring is confounded with additional contact. The small number of studies where contacts were matched had heterogeneous outcomes. One of these studies tested different number of contacts without detecting a dose response effect, but the tailored materials tended to outperform the standard ones whatever the number of contacts. We are inclined to the view that contact or assessment alone is unlikely to contribute much to the impact of tailoring, and has to form part of the tailoring process. Under this assumption, pooling all studies of tailored materials versus standard materials can be justified and the evidence suggests not only that they are more effective than no intervention, but also that they are more effective than standard materials. It should be noted though that even large individual studies have mostly failed to detect statistically significant long-term effects, and the absolute increase in quit rates attributable to the use of tailored materials is still small. Two of the authors of studies included in this meta-analysis are cautious about the effects of some types of tailoring. Aveyard is sceptical about the benefit of the expert system tailoring based on the transtheoretical ('stages of change') model (TTM) as implemented in their trial in unselected smokers (<LINK REF="STD-Aveyard-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Aveyard 2003</LINK>). Borland (<LINK REF="STD-Borland-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Borland 2003</LINK>) also concluded that tailoring using the TTM did not improve quit rates for smokers calling a quitline. However in a second trial using an improved system of tailoring this group did detect an improvement over standard materials (<LINK REF="STD-Borland-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Borland 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>It remains unclear which elements of personalizing information to individual smokers may be important, and which theories should inform the tailoring of materials (<LINK REF="REF-Skinner-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Skinner 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Strecher-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Strecher 1999</LINK>). The authors of a study using personalization as a placebo for individualized tailoring whilst manipulating expectancies suggest that the non-specific effects of tailoring may be relevant (<LINK REF="STD-Webb-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Webb 2005</LINK>). Another study amongst students who were told they were evaluating messages to be used in self-help materials suggested that both personalizing and feedback might contribute to the effect of tailored materials (<LINK REF="STD-Dijkstra-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Dijkstra 2005</LINK>). Although three of the largest studies have been conducted by Prochaska and colleagues, other groups have also shown similar sizes of effect. In one study where tailoring did not appear beneficial the intervention materials were very brief and did not give much information about how to quit. The authors have discussed a number of explanations for this negative finding (<LINK REF="REF-Reiter-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reiter 2003</LINK>). In considering whether and how to tailor materials it appears to be important to consider the broad characteristics of the population who will be targeted. Callers to a quitline are likely to require advice geared to making their quit attempt successful rather than the motivational elements which may be appropriate to a broader population-based intervention. One group of researchers has noted that, whilst tailoring based on the transtheoretical model typically generates a large proportion of unique materials for smokers in contemplation, preparation, action, and maintenance, even if only normative data is used, the variability in materials is much smaller for smokers in precontemplation (<LINK REF="REF-Schumann-2008b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schumann 2008b</LINK>). Absolute increases in quit rates depend to some extent on the population recruited to the intervention. In one of the largest studies (<LINK REF="STD-Velicer-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Velicer 1999</LINK>), which recruited 85% of identified smokers in a Health Maintenance Organisation, there was a 1.5% to 3% increase in six-month sustained abstinence at 18 months compared to standard materials, depending on assumptions about the smoking status of smokers lost to follow-up. This is similar to the average absolute increase in quit rate of 1% to 3% when all tailored trials are pooled.</P>
<P>Offering tailored interventions depends on the ability to obtain baseline data. This may be difficult, and introduces a delay if printed materials are being mailed, though data from a study new to this update suggests that placebo tailoring may be effective in the absence of data with which to actually tailor the intervention (<LINK REF="STD-Webb-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Webb 2013</LINK>
). Newer formats for providing self-help support may have greater potential for providing relevant and timely interventions. Although the evidence from trials is not yet optimal, using the internet to provide individually tailored information and support may avoid the limitations of traditional self-help materials (<LINK REF="REF-Civljak-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Civljak 2013</LINK>). Using mobile phones to deliver text message based interventions also shows promise for supporting people who are making quit attempts (<LINK REF="REF-Whittaker-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Whittaker 2012</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Methodological considerations</HEADING>
<P>Our conclusions about the effect of self-help materials are based on an intention-to-treat analysis in which all randomized participants are included whether or not they received the intended intervention. A number of studies reported subgroup analyses showing that quit rates were higher amongst those who made more use of the programme. However, we cannot assume that this is a causal relationship, since it may be that those prepared to read a manual were those already most motivated and equipped to quit successfully. Tailored materials may produce a benefit because they are more appealing and readable so that more people use them.</P>
<P>We also make the assumption that participants who cannot be reached for follow-up or who decline further participation are all still smoking. It has been argued that in minimal contact population-based studies participants may be unreachable for reasons unrelated to their smoking status, and that the assumption that they are all smokers leads to unnecessarily conservative quit rates (<LINK REF="REF-Hall-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hall 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Prochaska-2001a" TYPE="STUDY">Prochaska 2001a</LINK>). Prochaska, Velicer and colleagues distinguish between those lost to follow-up and those who withdraw from the trial. We have used numbers randomized in our primary analysis, but conducted a sensitivity analysis of the effect of using numbers followed up as the denominator. This of course increases the average quit rates in both intervention and control groups, but since drop-out rates are typically quite similar across study arms it has only a small impact on the estimate of the relative effect. It has no effect on the conclusions about tailoring.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">A continued role for print-based self help?</HEADING>
<P>It is well recognized that the majority of ex-smokers state that they have given up without the aid of a formal cessation programme. As Fisher and colleagues have pointed out (<LINK REF="REF-Fisher-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fisher 1993</LINK>) 'they have quit amongst a substantial array of health education messages, encouragement from health professionals ...changes in norms related to smoking ... and the experience gained from their own prior quit attempts'. Information is an important part of individual participation in all forms of health care, and the provision of written and other forms of information to smokers has important face validity. However, the effects of providing standardized self-help materials are modest at best. Smokers who seek help are likely to benefit more from brief advice or counselling, or from tailored materials. </P>
<P>This being said, Fisher's quotation is illustrative of a landscape in which legislative and individual support is available to help people who wish to quit. Though smokers wishing to quit are likely to benefit more from intensive interventions than from self-help, this is only relevant where these more intensive interventions are available. The studies included in this review overwhelmingly represent a population with access to more intensive stop-smoking support (of the 73 included studies, 72 were conducted in high income countries according to the World Bank definition; the one outlier was conducted in Hong Kong). In addition, studies in this review tended to include participants regardless of whether or not they wanted to quit smoking (only three of the 20 studies in our primary analyses focused on smokers who wished to stop). This review, therefore, can inform decisions as to whether print-based self-help should be used in developed countries, but paradoxically it can not tell us about the population who these interventions are now most likely to benefit - people motivated to quit who do not have other support available. By 2020, the World Health Organization estimates that there will be over 6 million tobacco related deaths in developing countries a year. In light of this, even a very modest effect size could have significant public health impact when applied at a population level. Further research, conducted outside of Western Europe, North America, and Australia, is therefore needed to determine if print-based self-help interventions still have a role to play.</P>

<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2014-05-21 13:47:58 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Lindsay Stead">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>Access to information, in understandable formats, is important for individuals who smoke, as it is for those with other kinds of medical problem. This review examined the specific effect of materials which aimed to provide a structured approach to smoking cessation beyond simple information. Such materials may provide a very small increase in quitting compared to no intervention. We did not find evidence that self-help materials produce incremental benefits over other minimal interventions such as advice from a healthcare professional, or nicotine replacement therapy. There is increasing evidence that materials that are tailored for individual smokers are more effective than no intervention, and more effective than non-tailored materials, although the absolute increase in quit rates is still small.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2014-05-21 13:47:58 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Lindsay Stead">
<P>Almost all included studies were conducted in high income countries; future research should examine the effects of print-based self-help in contexts where more intensive support may not be available. In addition, future research in this field is likely to focus on ways of further individualizing self-help materials, delivered in a variety of formats.</P>
