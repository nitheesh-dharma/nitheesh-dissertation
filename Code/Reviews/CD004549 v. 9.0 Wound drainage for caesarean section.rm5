There was some evidence from one trial that a subcutaneous drain may increase wound infection compared to a sub-sheath drain (RR 5.42, 95% CI 1.28 to 22.98). No differences in outcomes were found between subcutaneous drainage and subcutaneous suturing in the three trials that made this comparison.</P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2013-12-10 09:08:45 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2013-12-10 08:24:14 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Caesarean section is probably the commonest major operation performed on women in the world. Essentially the operation involves exposing the uterus by entering the abdominal cavity through the abdominal wall. The peritoneal lining of the abdomen is opened and the peritoneum covering the uterus is usually also entered. The bladder is reflected away from the uterus to reduce the chance of damage to it during the operation. The uterus is then incised and the baby and placenta delivered. Adequate haemostasis is achieved by closure of the uterine muscle followed by closure of the abdominal wall.</P>
<P>There are many possible ways of performing a caesarean section operation, and operative techniques vary widely (<LINK REF="REF-Tully-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tully 2002</LINK>). The techniques used may depend on many factors including the clinical situation and the preferences of the operator. For an overview of the techniques, indications for caesarean section and postoperative complications, see the Cochrane review 'Techniques for caesarean section' (<LINK REF="REF-Hofmeyr-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hofmeyr 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>Sub-rectus sheath drains, or drains between the sheath and the skin (subcutaneous) are sometimes used after caesarean section operations. Drains are used routinely by fewer than 10% of obstetricians in the UK, but in a survey 52% used them 'when indicated at the time of operation' (<LINK REF="REF-Tully-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tully 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>The aim of siting a sub-sheath drain is to remove as much blood as possible from the abdominal cavity after surgery. Blood and serous fluid can irritate the peritoneal lining of the abdomen and cause postoperative pain, and can also provide a medium in which bacterial infection may thrive. Theoretically, therefore, a drain can reduce pain and the risk of pelvic infection for the mother, while allowing fluid loss to be measured externally.</P>
<P>There are disadvantages of using a sub-sheath drain. A drain may be ineffective if blood clots in the abdominal cavity. Women sometimes find the site of drainage tubes uncomfortable and an attached suction bottle inconvenient after surgery. Drains can be difficult or painful to remove and occasionally have to be removed under anaesthetic. The drainage tube itself can provide a focus for infection and can even lead to sinus formation between the skin and abdominal cavity. Some surgeons would argue that a drain is not necessary because the peritoneum heals extremely rapidly and reabsorbs blood as part of this process.</P>
<P>Types of drain that may be used at caesarean section include closed suction drains, in which the blood loss can be measured in a collection bottle. This can give an early indication of intra-abdominal bleeding and has the advantage that the fluid loss is contained. Corrugated drains and wide-bore tube drains are also sometimes used but their disadvantage is that any fluid drained needs to be soaked up by dressings.</P>
<P>This review incorporates the old Cochrane review "Closed suction wound drainage at caesarean section" (<LINK REF="REF-Enkin-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Enkin 1995</LINK>) which incorporated two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Loong-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Loong 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Saunders-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Saunders 1988</LINK>). That review concluded that "The use of closed wound drainage may be of benefit when haemostasis is not adequate, but a benefit from the routine use of such drainage has not been established". This review includes trials which have been published since 1995.</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>To compare the effects of using a wound drain with not using a wound drain at caesarean section, and the effects of different types of drain, on maternal health and healthcare resource use.</P>

<HETEROGENEITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2010-07-22 15:00:46 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Decisions about whether to combine studies in meta-analyses were based primarily on consideration of their clinical and methodological similarity. Fixed effect meta-analysis was used for combining study data if the trials were judged to be sufficiently similar. Heterogeneity was assessed by calculating I-squared (I<SUP>2</SUP>) and tau-squared (Tau<SUP>2</SUP>) statistics (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2009b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2009b</LINK>). We considered that heterogeneity was substantial if I<SUP>2</SUP> exceeded 30% and Tau<SUP>2</SUP> was greater than zero. If a high level of heterogeneity was found among the trials included in an analysis, we considered whether it was appropriate and meaningful to produce an overall summary. If we judged that it was, we used random effects meta-analysis to estimate the average treatment effect, and calculated a 95% prediction interval for the underlying treatment effect (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2009b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2009b</LINK>).</P>

<BR/>For this update one additional study met the inclusion criteria, therefore ten studies in total comparing wound drain with no drain were included in the review. Only three studies randomised women into two groups comparing a drain with no drainage (<LINK REF="STD-Al-Inany-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Al Inany 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ramsey-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ramsey 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Saunders-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Saunders 1988</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Al-Inany-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Al Inany 2002</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Ramsey-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ramsey 2005</LINK> used a subcutaneous drain, and <LINK REF="STD-Saunders-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Saunders 1988</LINK> used a sub rectus sheath drain. In <LINK REF="STD-Ramsey-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ramsey 2005</LINK> all women also had closure of the subcutaneous tissue. Two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Maharaj-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Maharaj 2000</LINK> ; <LINK REF="STD-Ochsenbein_x002d_Imhof-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Ochsenbein-Imhof 2001</LINK>) each used two drains as the intervention, these were subcutaneous and sub rectus sheath drains which were closed suction in the Ochsenbein-Imhof study and corrugated in the Maharaj study. <LINK REF="STD-Magann-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Magann 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Allaire-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Allaire 2000</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Kumar-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Kumar 2004</LINK> undertook three-armed studies, randomising women to a subcutaneous drain, suturing of subcutaneous fat, or neither. In these three trials, the suturing and no treatment groups were combined to form a "no drainage" control group for the comparison of drain with no drainage. <LINK REF="STD-Loong-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Loong 1988</LINK> used a factorial design, carrying out separate randomisation for sub rectus sheath suction drain versus no drain and subcutaneous corrugated drain versus no drain. The results were reported as four groups: subcutaneous drain, rectus sheath drain, both drains and no drain. In the comparison of drain versus no drain in this review, the no drain group is compared with all of the women who received one or two drains. <LINK REF="STD-CAESAR-2010" TYPE="STUDY">CAESAR 2010</LINK> was a large, international 2x2x2 factorial trial, evaluating single versus double layer closure of the uterine incision, closure versus non-closure of the pelvic peritoneum and liberal versus restricted use of a sub-sheath wound drain. The intervention was described as "liberal versus restricted use" as it was recognised that in some circumstances clinicians would be unwilling to insert a drain for women randomised to that group, and similarly, would want to use in drain in some women randomised to no drain.</P>
<P>Studies varied in the duration of wound drainage, from 6 to 36 hours in <LINK REF="STD-Loong-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Loong 1988</LINK> to 72 hours in <LINK REF="STD-Allaire-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Allaire 2000</LINK>. Three studies (<LINK REF="STD-CAESAR-2010" TYPE="STUDY">CAESAR 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Magann-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Magann 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ochsenbein_x002d_Imhof-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Ochsenbein-Imhof 2001</LINK>) did not document when the drains were removed.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Populations</HEADING>
<P>All studies specified the inclusion of women having either first or repeat caesarean sections, except <LINK REF="STD-Ochsenbein_x002d_Imhof-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Ochsenbein-Imhof 2001</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Maharaj-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Maharaj 2000</LINK>, where this was not specified. Eight studies included both pre labour and intrapartum caesarean sections; <LINK REF="STD-Al-Inany-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Al Inany 2002</LINK> restricted the eligibility to intrapartum operations, and <LINK REF="STD-Maharaj-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Maharaj 2000</LINK> included only "emergency" caesareans but did not specify whether these were intrapartum or not.</P>
<P>Five trials were restricted to obese women, with either more than 2cm thickness of subcutaneous fat (<LINK REF="STD-Al-Inany-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Al Inany 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Allaire-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Allaire 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kumar-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Kumar 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Magann-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Magann 2002</LINK>), or more than 4cm of subcutaneous fat (<LINK REF="STD-Ramsey-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ramsey 2005</LINK>). Six trials used transverse skin incisions in all (or virtually all) participants (<LINK REF="STD-Al-Inany-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Al Inany 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-CAESAR-2010" TYPE="STUDY">CAESAR 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kumar-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Kumar 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Loong-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Loong 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Maharaj-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Maharaj 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Saunders-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Saunders 1988</LINK>), two used a mixture of transverse and vertical incisions (<LINK REF="STD-Magann-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Magann 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ramsey-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ramsey 2005</LINK>), and two did not specify the types of skin incision used (<LINK REF="STD-Allaire-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Allaire 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ochsenbein_x002d_Imhof-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Ochsenbein-Imhof 2001</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Outcome assessment</HEADING>
<P>The timing of outcome assessment varied. Only four studies (<LINK REF="STD-Al-Inany-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Al Inany 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-CAESAR-2010" TYPE="STUDY">CAESAR 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Magann-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Magann 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ramsey-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ramsey 2005</LINK>) attempted comprehensive follow up of all women several weeks after discharge. The remainder recorded outcomes up to discharge or the time of skin staple removal, which was a maximum of 10 days. <LINK REF="STD-Allaire-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Allaire 2000</LINK> performed a chart review to identify any outcomes that occurred later, but this would not have detected any outcomes that occurred after discharge and were treated in a different hospital.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Randomisation and allocation concealment</HEADING>
<P>Six studies (<LINK REF="STD-Allaire-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Allaire 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-CAESAR-2010" TYPE="STUDY">CAESAR 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kumar-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Kumar 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Magann-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Magann 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Maharaj-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Maharaj 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ramsey-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ramsey 2005</LINK>) used computer generated random numbers to ensure random assignment to the groups. The other four studies gave no information on the generation of the allocation sequence.</P>
<P>One study used a telephone randomisation system to allocate women to groups (<LINK REF="STD-CAESAR-2010" TYPE="STUDY">CAESAR 2010</LINK>). Eight studies used sealed opaque envelopes, although only one of them mentioned numbering of the envelopes or any other measures to ensure that all envelopes could be accounted for (<LINK REF="STD-Ramsey-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ramsey 2005</LINK>). One study (<LINK REF="STD-Loong-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Loong 1988</LINK>) stated that randomisation was by "sets of random numbers used by nursing staff". This suggests that the randomisation schedule may have been open, with no allocation concealment.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Magann-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Magann 2002</LINK> randomised women before surgery, and excluded them from the analysis if subcutaneous fat thickness was found during surgery to be less than 2cm. This procedure could cause several problems. Firstly, a strict intention to treat analysis was not done because a large proportion of those randomised were found not to be eligible (374/964). Secondly, consent was obtained from 374 women who were not eligible, which may be ethically questionable. Thirdly, assessment of eligibility once the woman's randomised group was already known could introduce bias. Surgeons' decisions about eligibility in cases where the subcutaneous fat thickness was close to 2cm may have been influenced, consciously or unconsciously, by the random assignment. However, no differences between the groups in baseline characteristics were apparent. The other studies designed to look at drain use in obese women randomised during the operation, after measurement of the subcutaneous fat.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Blinding</HEADING>
<P>Blinding of participants would be difficult, and blinding of surgeons impossible when drains are being used. We have assumed that neither of these were done. No study mentioned any attempt at blinding the people who were assessing outcomes. Blinding of outcome assessment is possible and it is important to achieve this especially when the assessment of outcomes can be subjective, for example if infection is judged to be present on appearance alone, or if a postoperative complication is viewed as relevant.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Exclusions and ITT analysis</HEADING>
<P>The Magann study had a high level of post-randomisation exclusions, as noted above. These were not reported by randomised group, but the groups as analysed were of similar size, so it seems unlikely that the number of exclusions was substantially different between the groups.</P>
<P>There was no report of any post-randomisation exclusions in five studies, and only small numbers were excluded in another three (<LINK REF="STD-Al-Inany-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Al Inany 2002</LINK>, 2 women; <LINK REF="STD-Maharaj-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Maharaj 2000</LINK>, 3 women; <LINK REF="STD-Ramsey-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ramsey 2005</LINK> 12 women). No outcome information for these women was given by <LINK REF="STD-Al-Inany-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Al Inany 2002</LINK> or <LINK REF="STD-Ramsey-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ramsey 2005</LINK>, so they could not be included in the review. It was unclear for <LINK REF="STD-Maharaj-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Maharaj 2000</LINK> whether the three excluded women (who were all allocated to no drainage but received drains) were in fact included in the results or not. For this review we have used the data as published, assuming that data on the three "exclusions" are reported, pending further investigation.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-CAESAR-2010" TYPE="STUDY">CAESAR 2010</LINK> randomised women before the start of surgery, and a small number of women delivered vaginally (30/3033). Two women also withdrew consent before caesarean section. These 32 women (1%) were excluded from the analysis.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Magann-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Magann 2002</LINK> followed up all women at 2 to 6 weeks, but suffered from a high rate of loss to follow up at this point (24%). However, the results reported in the paper did not refer only to those women who were successfully followed up at 2 weeks, but included data from hospital discharge, when all women were examined. Thus, it would not be correct to use the number of women followed up as the denominator, as some of those who had outcomes may not have had a follow-up examination. The numerator used in the review is therefore the number of each outcome reported. The denominator used is the number of women for whom outcome information was available (in this case all the women randomised). This is likely to lead to an underestimate of the true risk of the outcomes.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Overall risk of bias</HEADING>
<P>The overall methodological quality of most studies was moderate or unclear. One large study (<LINK REF="STD-CAESAR-2010" TYPE="STUDY">CAESAR 2010</LINK>) was of good methodological quality. Two studies had specific bias risks: <LINK REF="STD-Loong-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Loong 1988</LINK> did not appear to have used an adequate method of allocation concealment, and <LINK REF="STD-Magann-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Magann 2002</LINK> may have been subject to bias introduced by differential withdrawal or ineligibility. No studies performed blinded outcome assessment so there is potential for bias to be introduced in all (<LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>; <LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Comparison 1: Wound drain compared with no drain</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Primary outcomes</HEADING>
<P>Wound drainage did not appear to reduce the incidence of wound infections (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>; RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.21); 7 trials, 4377 women), or febrile morbidity (<LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>; RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.15); 6 studies, 3829 women). The incidence of febrile morbidity varied widely between the trials, from less than 1% (<LINK REF="STD-CAESAR-2010" TYPE="STUDY">CAESAR 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ochsenbein_x002d_Imhof-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Ochsenbein-Imhof 2001</LINK>) to 27% (<LINK REF="STD-Loong-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Loong 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Saunders-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Saunders 1988</LINK>). This may reflect different incidence of the outcome in different populations, but also different definitions of febrile morbidity. <LINK REF="STD-CAESAR-2010" TYPE="STUDY">CAESAR 2010</LINK> reported maternal fever in several ways; temperature &gt;39<SUP>0</SUP> C on any occasion, temperature &gt;38<SUP>0</SUP> C on two or more days, and antibiotics given for febrile morbidity. We have used antibiotics given for febrile morbidity as the outcome in the review; the numbers with temperature &gt; 38<SUP>0</SUP> C on two or more days were very similar, and the incidence of temperature &gt; 39<SUP>0</SUP> C was very low.</P>
<P>The results for wound complications were heterogeneous (<LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 57% and Tau<SUP>2</SUP> = 0.15, 6 studies, 1640 women), which may have been partly due to differing definitions of "wound complications" between studies. This outcome was summarised with a random effects analysis. The average treatment effect was RR 0.85 (95% CI 0.55 to 1.32) and the 95% prediction interval was 0.25 to 2.94. This analysis suggests that there is no evidence of a reduction in wound complications with drainage, but individual studies may find widely differing effects. The width of the prediction interval reflects the relatively small number of studies and the inconsistency between them. The largest study, <LINK REF="STD-CAESAR-2010" TYPE="STUDY">CAESAR 2010</LINK>, did not report the composite outcome wound complications, but did report operative procedures on the wound 12/1398 in the drain group versus 5/1398 in the no drain group; RR 2.40 (95% CI 0.85 to 6.79).</P>
<P>Postoperative pain was reported by two studies (<LINK REF="STD-CAESAR-2010" TYPE="STUDY">CAESAR 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kumar-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Kumar 2004</LINK>). Both used a visual analogue scale (VAS). <LINK REF="STD-Kumar-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Kumar 2004</LINK> (using a 10cm VAS) found no difference between the drain and no drain groups (mean difference -0.15, 95% CI -0.36 to 0.06; <LINK REF="CMP-001.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.4</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-CAESAR-2010" TYPE="STUDY">CAESAR 2010</LINK> reported medians and IQRs for pain at hospital discharge and at 6 weeks post-partum (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>). No differences were found between the liberal and restricted drain use groups.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Secondary outcomes</HEADING>
<P>Two trials analysed the difference in mean blood loss between the groups. The meta-analysis showed an average of 23 ml more blood loss in the drain group (95% CI -1.93 to 48.74) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.5</LINK>). This suggests that if there is an advantage to wound drainage, it is small and probably not clinically significant. <LINK REF="STD-CAESAR-2010" TYPE="STUDY">CAESAR 2010</LINK> reported blood transfusion (<LINK REF="CMP-001.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.6</LINK>); there was no evidence of a difference between the groups (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.48).</P>
<P>Four trials reported the duration of surgery. There was substantial heterogeneity in this outcome (Tau<SUP>2</SUP> = 16.21 and I<SUP>2</SUP> = 93%) and we judged that the results were too different to combine, hence no meta-analysis was performed. Two trials found no difference, one found that duration of surgery was 3.4 minutes longer in the drain group, and the third found that it was 10 minutes longer in the drain group (<LINK REF="CMP-001.07" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.7</LINK>). It would be expected that an operation including the insertion of a drain would take longer, and it is not clear whether differences in the duration of operation of a few minutes have any impact on women's health.</P>
<P>Five studies reported the effects on postnatal hospital stay between the drain and no drain groups. The results were heterogeneous, with four studies finding no difference but one (<LINK REF="STD-Ochsenbein_x002d_Imhof-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Ochsenbein-Imhof 2001</LINK>) finding that hospital stay was 0.9 days shorter in the no drain group. These results were not combined because of the high heterogeneity (<LINK REF="CMP-001.08" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.8</LINK>).</P>
<P>Two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Ramsey-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ramsey 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-CAESAR-2010" TYPE="STUDY">CAESAR 2010</LINK>) reported readmission of women to hospital (<LINK REF="CMP-001.09" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.9</LINK>).

<P>Two studies (<LINK REF="STD-CAESAR-2010" TYPE="STUDY">CAESAR 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Magann-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Magann 2002</LINK>) reported the effects of wound drainage on endometritis (RR 1.20, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.59) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.12" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.12</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-CAESAR-2010" TYPE="STUDY">CAESAR 2010</LINK> reported a composite outcome, infectious morbidity, as its primary outcome. This was defined as one or more of the following: (i) antibiotic use for maternal febrile morbidity during the postnatal hospital stay; (ii) endometritis; (iii) wound infection treated with antibiotics. This outcome occurred in 247/1398 women in the liberal drain use group and 228/1398 in the restricted drain use group (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.92, 1.27).</P>

<P>One small trial provided a comparison between two different types of drains (<LINK REF="STD-Loong-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Loong 1988</LINK>). The trial found significantly more wound infections when a subcutaneous drain was used, compared with a sub-sheath drain (RR 5.42, 95% CI 1.28 to 22.98, <LINK REF="CMP-002.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.1</LINK>). However, there were only 121 women in this comparison, and the trial used a method of allocation concealment that was probably insecure. The same trial did not demonstrate a difference in the risk of febrile morbidity between the groups (RR 1.28, 95% CI 0.70 to 2.34, <LINK REF="CMP-002.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.2</LINK>), although the difference was in the same direction.</P>

The 95% prediction interval for this analysis was extremely wide and encompassed all plausible values; hence there is little evidence about the likely range of treatment effects, due to the small number of trials in this analysis. Febrile morbidity, blood loss, duration of surgery, duration of postnatal hospital stay, postoperative pain and endometritis were reported by only one trial, and none showed any evidence of a difference between the interventions (<LINK REF="CMP-003.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.3</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-003.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.4</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-003.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.5</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-003.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.6</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-003.07" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.7</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-003.08" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.8</LINK>).</P>

<P>For the comparison of drain with no drain, there were no clear differences in any of the outcomes measured, though the point estimates for wound complications and febrile morbidity were in the direction of benefit to wound drainage. The point estimates for blood loss, endometritis and breastfeeding were in the opposite direction, but were based on only one or two trials. There were inconsistent results on duration of postnatal hospital stay and duration of surgery.</P>
<P>Data comparing sub-sheath with subcutaneous drains were available from only one trial, and favoured sub-sheath drainage for wound infection.</P>
<P>Comparison of wound drainage with subcutaneous suturing found no clear differences in outcome between the groups.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Overall completeness and applicability of evidence  </HEADING>
<P>The trials included in the review were conducted in a variety of different countries with different health care systems, and consequently differences in the care provided outside the trial and in the surgical techniques used during the caesarean section operation. There were also clear differences between the populations included in the trials, with five of them restricted to obese women. This also may have introduced heterogeneity, as it is possible that the interventions studies may be either more or less effective in women with a thick layer of subcutaneous fat. We did not find any differences in results between studies that recruited obese women and those that recruited unselected populations, but there were few studies and these analyses lacked power.</P>
<P>The analysis of <LINK REF="STD-CAESAR-2010" TYPE="STUDY">CAESAR 2010</LINK> explored interactions between the pairs of randomised interventions in this 2x2x2 factorial trial. It found that there was evidence of an interaction between closure of the peritoneum and use of a sub rectus sheath drain for the primary outcome, infectious morbidity. In women allocated liberal drain use, there was a higher incidence of infectious morbidity in those who had non-closure of the pelvic peritoneum (20.8% versus 14.8% in the group with closure of the pelvic peritoneum), but in women allocated to restricted drain use, the incidence of infectious morbidity was lower among those allocated to peritoneal closure (15.6% versus 17.7%; interaction test P=0.006). Similar effects were apparent for wound infection (P=0.01) and duration of surgery (P=0.005). These results suggest that the treatment effect of drainage versus no drainage may depend on other surgical techniques that are used. This may introduce heterogeneity into the results of trials, and mean that evaluation of individual aspects of the operation may not identify the most effective techniques.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Quality of the evidence  </HEADING>
<P>Most of the included studies had small to moderate sample sizes, which were inadequate to detect clinically important differences in relatively rare outcomes. Only two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Loong-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Loong 1988</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Maharaj-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Maharaj 2000</LINK>) documented having carried out a sample size calculation before the trial. One study was much larger (<LINK REF="STD-CAESAR-2010" TYPE="STUDY">CAESAR 2010</LINK>), recruiting over 2800 women, and had the fewest methodological issues, so this trial is likely to provide the best quality evidence.</P>
<P>Methodological quality was generally moderate or unclear. Information about allocation concealment and blinding was limited, and no studies reported measures to blind outcome assessment. Blinding of outcome assessment is important to achieve especially when the assessment of outcomes can be subjective, for example if infection is judged to be present on appearance alone.One study did not use a secure method of allocation concealment, and another study had a query over post-randomisation exclusions.</P>
<P>Studies also reported different outcome measures, so that although ten trials compared wound drainage with no drainage, no analysis contained data from more than seven trials. Follow-up beyond hospital discharge was very limited, and no studies have yet reported long-term follow-up. The effects of these techniques for subsequent pregnancies and long-term morbidity remain unknown.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2012-07-25 14:59:43 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The existing evidence from ten trials does not show benefit from wound drainage at caesarean section, and is compatible with modest benefit or harm. The trials did not address the question of whether wound drainage is of benefit when haemostasis is not felt to be adequate.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2012-07-25 15:02:09 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Assessment of interventions' effects on longer term outcomes is needed. It may also be of interest to explore the role of different types and sites of wound drain, the effects of different degrees of obesity, first or repeat caesarean section, and whether the caesarean section is performed intrapartum or pre labour, and the interactions of wound drainage with other aspects of the caesarean section operation.</P>

<BR/>We have provided the search strategies for Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid EMBASE and EBSCO CINAHL in; <LINK REF="APP-02" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 2</LINK>, <LINK REF="APP-03" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 3</LINK> and <LINK REF="APP-04" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 4</LINK> respectively. We combined the Ovid MEDLINE search with the Cochrane Highly Sensitive Search Strategy for identifying randomised trials in MEDLINE: sensitivity- and precision-maximising version (2008 revision) (Lefebvre 2009). We combined the Ovid EMBASE and EBSCO CINAHL searches with the trial filters developed by the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (<LINK REF="REF-SIGN-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">SIGN 2009</LINK>).¬There were no restrictions on the basis of date or language of publication.</P>
