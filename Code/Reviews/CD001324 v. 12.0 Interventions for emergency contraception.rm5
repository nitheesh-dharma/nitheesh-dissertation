<DESCRIPTION>
<P>The number of included studies in this updated review increased from 81 to 100. Compared with levonorgestrel, the risk ratio of pregnancy with mid-dose (25 mg-50 mg) mifepristone was slightly increased from 0.50 (95% CI 0.32 to 0.79) to 0.64 (95% CI 0.45 to 0.92) in this update. Ulipristal acetate appeared more effective than levonorgestrel, but more data are needed to confirm this association. Ulipristal acetate users were more likely to experience a menstrual return after the expected date than levonorgestrel users did. However, levonorgestrel was associated with higher risk of early menstrual return than ulipristal acetate. Gestrinone was included in this review for the first time. It appeared to have similar effectiveness and overall side effects as mifepristone. The latter was associated with higher risk of menstrual delay than gestrinone.</P>

<P>
<B>Review question</B>
</P>
<P>The aim of this Cochrane Review was to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of different methods of emergency contraception to prevent pregnancy following unprotected intercourse.</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>Emergency contraception (EC) is using a drug or copper intrauterine device (Cu-IUD) to prevent pregnancy shortly after unprotected intercourse. Several interventions are available for EC. Information on the comparative effectiveness, safety and convenience of these methods is crucial for reproductive healthcare providers and the women they serve. Researchers in Cochrane collected and analyzed all relevant studies to answer this question.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>We searched 10 English-language and three Chinese-language databases for published studies in any language, in February 2017. We also searched grey literature databases and websites and contacted experts and authors for eligible studies. Studies had to report information on interventions to prevent pregnancy after a single act of unprotected intercourse. We included 115 randomized controlled trials with 60,479 women in this review. Ninety-two trials were conducted in China. The evidence is up-to-date to February 2017.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>The studies compared 25 different interventions of different types of emergency contraception. The studies showed the following.</P>
<P>Levonorgestrel and mifepristone were more effective than Yuzpe regimen (estradiol-levonorgestrel combination). Our findings suggest that if 29 women per 1000 become pregnant with Yuzpe, between 11 and 24 women per 1000 will do so with the levonorgestrel, and that if 25 women per 1000 become pregnant with Yuzpe, between one and 10 women per 1000 will do so with mifepristone.</P>
<P>Mid-dose mifepristone (25 mg to 50 mg) was probably more effective than levonorgestrel. Low-dose mifepristone (less than 25 mg) was probably less effective than mid-dose mifepristone, but both were more effective than levonorgestrel (two doses of 0.75 mg). Ulipristal acetate (UPA) was also more effective than levonorgestrel.</P>
<P>Levonorgestrel users had fewer side effects than Yuzpe users, and might be more likely to resume menstruation before the expected date. UPA users were probably more likely to resume menstruation after the expected date. Menstrual delay was probably the main adverse effect of mifepristone and seemed to be dose-related. Cu-IUD may be associated with higher risks of abdominal pain than mifepristone.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
</P>
<P>The quality of the evidence for the primary outcome (observed number of pregnancies) ranged from moderate to high, and for other outcomes ranged from very low to high. The main limitations were risk of bias (associated with poor reporting of methods), imprecision and inconsistency.</P>

<P>We included 115 trials with 60,479 women in this review. The quality of the evidence for the primary outcome ranged from moderate to high, and for other outcomes ranged from very low to high.

<P>
<I>Comparative effectiveness of different emergency contraceptive pills (ECP)</I>
</P>
<P>Levonorgestrel was associated with fewer pregnancies than Yuzpe (estradiol-levonorgestrel combination) (RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.39 to 0.84, 6 RCTs, n = 4750, I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 23%, high-quality evidence). This suggests that if the chance of pregnancy using Yuzpe is assumed to be 29 women per 1000, the chance of pregnancy using levonorgestrel would be between 11 and 24 women per 1000.</P>
<P>Mifepristone (all doses) was associated with fewer pregnancies than Yuzpe (RR 0.14, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.41, 3 RCTs, n = 2144, I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 0%, high-quality evidence). This suggests that if the chance of pregnancy following Yuzpe is assumed to be 25 women per 1000 women, the chance following mifepristone would be between 1 and 10 women per 1000.</P>
<P>Both low-dose mifepristone (less than 25 mg) and mid-dose mifepristone (25 mg to 50 mg) were probably associated with fewer pregnancies than levonorgestrel (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.52 to 0.99, 14 RCTs, n = 8752, I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 0%, high-quality evidence; RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.83, 27 RCTs, n = 6052, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%, moderate-quality evidence; respectively). This suggests that if the chance of pregnancy following levonorgestrel is assumed to be 20 women per 1000, the chance of pregnancy following low-dose mifepristone would be between 10 and 20 women per 1000; and that if the chance of pregnancy following levonorgestrel is assumed to be 35 women per 1000, the chance of pregnancy following mid-dose mifepristone would be between 16 and 29 women per 1000.</P>
<P>Ulipristal acetate (UPA) was associated with fewer pregnancies than levonorgestrel (RR 0.59; 95% CI 0.35 to 0.99, 2 RCTs, n = 3448, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%, high-quality evidence).</P>
<P>
<I>Comparative effectiveness of different ECP doses</I>
</P>
<P>It was unclear whether there was any difference in pregnancy rate between single-dose levonorgestrel (1.5 mg) and the standard two-dose regimen (0.75 mg 12 hours apart) (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.33, 3 RCTs, n = 6653, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%, moderate-quality evidence).</P>
<P>Mid-dose mifepristone was associated with fewer pregnancies than low-dose mifepristone (RR 0.73; 95% CI 0.55 to 0.97, 25 RCTs, n = 11,914, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%, high-quality evidence).</P>
<P>
<I>Comparative effectiveness of Cu-IUD versus mifepristone</I>
</P>
<P>There was no conclusive evidence of a difference in the risk of pregnancy between the Cu-IUD and mifepristone (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.04 to 2.74, 2 RCTs, n = 395, low-quality evidence).</P>
<P>
<I>Adverse effects</I>
</P>
<P>Nausea and vomiting were the main adverse effects associated with emergency contraception. There is probably a lower risk of nausea (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.53 to 0.76, 3 RCTs, n = 2186 , I<SUP>2</SUP> = 59%, moderate-quality evidence) or vomiting (RR 0.12, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.20, 3 RCTs, n = 2186, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%, high-quality evidence) associated with mifepristone than with Yuzpe. levonorgestrel is probably associated with a lower risk of nausea (RR 0.40, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.44, 6 RCTs, n = 4750, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 82%, moderate-quality evidence), or vomiting (RR 0.29, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.35, 5 RCTs, n = 3640, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 78%, moderate-quality evidence) than Yuzpe. Levonorgestrel users were less likely to have any side effects than Yuzpe users (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.75 to 0.86; 1 RCT, n = 1955, high-quality evidence). UPA users were more likely than levonorgestrel users to have resumption of menstruation after the expected date (RR 1.65, 95% CI 1.42 to 1.92, 2 RCTs, n = 3593, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%, high-quality evidence). Menstrual delay was more common with mifepristone than with any other intervention and appeared to be dose-related. Cu-IUD may be associated with higher risks of abdominal pain than mifepristone (18 events in 95 women using Cu-IUD versus no events in 190 women using mifepristone, low-quality evidence).</P>

<P>Levonorgestrel and mid-dose mifepristone (25 mg to 50 mg) were more effective than Yuzpe regimen.

Mifepristone low dose (less than 25 mg) was less effective than mid-dose mifepristone. UPA was more effective than levonorgestrel.</P>
<P>Levonorgestrel users had fewer side effects than Yuzpe users, and appeared to be more likely to have a menstrual return before the expected date.

</P>
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2017-06-30 20:38:06 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Unwanted pregnancy is a common problem. Worldwide, over 40 million pregnancies end in abortion each year (<LINK REF="REF-Sedgh-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sedgh 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sedgh-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sedgh 2014</LINK>). The standard approach to this problem has been primary prevention (contraception), backed up by induced abortion. However, for a long time, 'contraception' has generally been understood to mean only anticipatory contraception. The definition of the primary prevention of unintended pregnancy could and should be expanded to include post hoc contraception (<LINK REF="REF-Grimes-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grimes 1997</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2017-07-13 13:54:58 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Emergency contraception (EC) is defined as the use of a drug or device as an emergency measure to prevent pregnancy after unprotected intercourse. From this definition it follows that methods of EC are used after coitus but before pregnancy occurs, and that they are intended as a back-up for occasional use rather than a regular form of contraception (<LINK REF="REF-Van-Look-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van Look 1993</LINK>). Although the terms 'morning after pill' and 'after-sex pill' are also used to describe the same approach, these can cause confusion regarding the timing and purpose, and are best avoided. EC implies something not to be used routinely (there are far more effective methods for regular contraception) but which can still prevent pregnancy if other options have failed or regular contraception was not used (<LINK REF="REF-Webb-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Webb 1995</LINK>).</P>
<P>To date, no contraceptive method is 100% reliable and few people use their method perfectly each time they have sexual intercourse, in particularly the short-acting contraceptives like oral pills and condoms. Furthermore, EC is useful in cases of sexual assault. EC is especially important for outreach to the 4.6 million women at risk of pregnancy but not using a regular method by providing a bridge to use of an ongoing contraceptive method (<LINK REF="REF-Trussell-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Trussell 2012</LINK>).</P>
<P>EC is widely available in Western Europe and in China. However, use of this method is rising rapidly in low- and middle-income countries. For example, the 2008 to 2009 Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) data showed that 22% of unmarried sexually active women in Albania had used EC. In Colombia, Kenya and Nigeria, according to data from DHS, 10% to 16% of unmarried, sexually active women used EC (<LINK REF="REF-ICEC-2012a" TYPE="REFERENCE">ICEC 2012a</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-ICEC-2012b" TYPE="REFERENCE">ICEC 2012b</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-ICEC-2012c" TYPE="REFERENCE">ICEC 2012c</LINK>). This proportion in Peru was 35% in 2010 (<LINK REF="REF-INEI-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">INEI 2011</LINK>). However, EC is largely under-utilised in many other countries. Examining data from 45 countries surveyed between 2000 and 2012, in 16 countries, fewer than 10% of women aged 15 to 49 years had heard of EC; in 36 countries, the rate of use of EC was less than 3% among women who had ever had sex (<LINK REF="REF-Palermo-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Palermo 2014</LINK>). The low awareness of emergency contraceptive pills (ECPs) and the lack of access to EC may subject women to unsafe abortions, which contribute significantly to maternal mortality and morbidity.</P>
<P>Although attempted throughout history, EC methods only started to become effective in the 1960s when hormonal regimens were first introduced. Following the introduction of high-dose oestrogens, the so-called Yuzpe regimen, involving the combined use of oestrogen (ethinyl oestradiol 100 &#956;g) and progestogen (levonorgestrel 0.5 mg or dl-norgestrel 1 mg), repeated once 12 hours apart, with the first dose given within 72 hours of unprotected intercourse, became popular in the late 1970s and early 1980s (<LINK REF="STD-Yuzpe-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Yuzpe 1977</LINK>).</P>
<P>Since the 1990s, there have been several different interventions available for EC (<LINK REF="REF-Glasier-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glasier 1997</LINK>). Interest in the development of alternative regimens has led to trials of the progestogen levonorgestrel, the anti-gonadotropin danazol, and the anti-progestins mifepristone and ulipristal acetate (UPA) (<LINK REF="REF-Trussell-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Trussell 2012</LINK>). Like the Yuzpe regimen, these methods are recommended for use within 72 hours of unprotected intercourse although levonorgestrel and mifepristone had been tested up to 120 hours (five days) after unprotected intercourse, for research purposes <LINK REF="STD-Glasier-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Glasier 2010</LINK>. The postcoital insertion of a copper intrauterine device (Cu-IUD) is an option that can be used up to five days after the estimated time of ovulation and can be left in the uterus as a long-term regular contraceptive method.</P>
<P>The main side effects caused by hormonal emergency contraceptives are nausea and vomiting, which seem to be more frequent with oestrogen-containing regimens such as Yuzpe regimen and high-dose oestrogen alone compared to progestogen or anti-progestogen treatment. Mifepristone can cause menstrual delay, while levonorgestrel may cause earlier menses. IUD insertion can cause discomfort and requires trained staff and facilities. It is generally recommended that the Cu-IUD be avoided in women at high risk of sexually transmitted diseases.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2017-06-30 22:14:41 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>EC can prevent pregnancy after unprotected intercourse but it does not always work effectively. Many factors may affect the effectiveness of EC, and different methods of EC may have different effectiveness. The risk of failure of a less effective method of EC is the major factor to be taken into account when estimating the risk of pregnancy.</P>
<P>For all ECs, the risk of pregnancy is related to the cycle day of intercourse. Women who have intercourse the day before estimated day of ovulation have a fourfold increased risk of pregnancy (odds ratio (OR) 4.42, 95% confidence interval (CI), 2.33 to 8.20; P &lt; 0.0001) compared with women having sex outside the fertile window (<LINK REF="REF-Glasier-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glasier 2011</LINK>). Time elapsed since intercourse (coitus-treatment interval) and further acts of intercourse during the same cycle in which EC was used are two other factors affecting the success of EC. It is suggested that emergency contraception may be less effective among obese women, though clinical data are sparse (<LINK REF="REF-Jatlaoui-2016a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jatlaoui 2016a</LINK>). This is biologically plausible, as there is evidence that among women taking the same dose of levonorgestrel, the serum concentration of levonorgestrel is 50% lower in those who are obese (BMI of 30 kg/m<SUP>2</SUP> or more) than in those with a normal or low BMI (less than 25 kg/m<SUP>2</SUP>) (<LINK REF="REF-Edelman-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Edelman 2016</LINK>).</P>
<P>Levonorgestrel is used in ECPs, both in a combined Yuzpe regimen which includes estrogen, and as a levonorgestrel-only method. The primary mechanism of action of levonorgestrel as a progestogen-only emergency contraceptive pill is to prevent fertilisation by inhibition of ovulation (<LINK REF="STD-Brache-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Brache 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gemzell_x002d_Danielsson-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gemzell-Danielsson 2004</LINK>) and thickening of cervical mucus (<LINK REF="REF-Lalitkumar-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lalitkumar 2013</LINK>). levonorgestrel can disrupt or inhibit ovulation in 96% of cycles if it is given in the presence of an ovarian follicle measuring 12 mm to 17 mm in diameter. Once the luteinising hormone (LH) surge has started levonorgestrel has no effect on ovulation. Review of the evidence suggests that levonorgestrel ECPs cannot prevent implantation of a fertilised egg. This explains the need to take levonorgestrel as soon as possible after intercourse, especially within 72 hours.</P>
<P>Ulipristal acetate (UPA) is a selective progesterone receptor modulator and also works by delaying or inhibiting ovulation. UPA remains reasonably effective even if given after the LH surge has started, delaying ovulation in 79% of cycles at this time, while levonorgestrel delays ovulation in only 14% (and placebo in 10%). Once LH has reached its peak, UPA no longer has any effect on ovulation. When UPA is given before the start of the LH surge, follicle rupture is delayed or inhibited in 100% of cycles (<LINK REF="REF-Baird-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baird 2015</LINK>). UPA can be used up to 120 hours after intercourse (<LINK REF="REF-Fine-2010a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fine 2010a</LINK>), but should be taken as soon as possible after intercourse (since if the woman has not yet ovulated, the longer she delays using EC the more likely she will be close to ovulation).</P>
<P>Mifepristone, another selective progesterone receptor modulator, has an effect on the endometrium and can both inhibit implantation and induce abortion (<LINK REF="REF-Gemzell_x002d_Danielsson-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gemzell-Danielsson 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>The Cu-IUD used for EC may prevent an oocyte from being fertilised if inserted before fertilisation has occurred but will also prevent implantation if it is inserted later (<LINK REF="REF-Cleland-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cleland 2012</LINK>).</P>

<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2017-07-20 10:55:13 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Information on the comparative effectiveness, safety and convenience of an EC method is crucial for reproductive healthcare providers and the women they serve. The present review aims to search systematically for, and combine, all evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and controlled clinical trials relating to the effectiveness of different EC methods in order to supply the best evidence currently available on which to base recommendations for clinical practice and further research.</P>
<P>In the previous version of this Cochrane Review, 100 RCTs and 25 comparisons were included. The findings included evidence that intermediate-dose mifepristone was superior to LNG and Yuzpe regimens and that low-dose mifepristone and UPA might possibly be more effective than LNG. As this version of the review was published 5 years ago (2012), and failed to evaluate the quality of the evidence using GRADE methods, we considered that with more recent evidence and updated methods our conclusions might be changed.</P>

For comparisons in which most of the studies failed to provide adequate details of their randomization methods, we did not downgrade the evidence for risk of bias if the analysis also included a large study at low risk of bias which had findings consistent with the smaller studies.</P>

<P>The inclusion and exclusion criteria were similar with some minor differences between trials. In general, women attending after 72 hours (after 120 hours in Cu-IUD, some mifepristone and levonorgestrel trials), with multiple episodes of unprotected intercourse, with irregular menstrual periods and those using hormonal contraception were excluded. All trials except <LINK REF="STD-Sang-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Sang 1999</LINK> started the intervention as soon as the women came to the clinic. <LINK REF="STD-Sang-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Sang 1999</LINK> included only women who had had unprotected intercourse 24 to 96 hours before attending the clinic.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Interventions</HEADING>
<P>Eighteen out of 115 trials had two or more treatment arms. Fifty-six trials involved dose-comparison studies of mifepristone in doses from 5 mg to 600 mg. Forty-one trials compared levonorgestrel with mifepristone. Six trials compared levonorgestrel with the Yuzpe regimen. Three trials (<LINK REF="STD-Arowojolu-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Arowojolu 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dada-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Dada 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-von-Hertzen-2002" TYPE="STUDY">von Hertzen 2002</LINK>) compared a split dose with a single dose of levonorgestrel and one trial compared a 24-hour with a 12-hour double-dose regimen of levonorgestrel. Two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Creinin-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Creinin 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Glasier-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Glasier 2010</LINK>) compared UPA, a second-generation progesterone receptor modulator, with levonorgestrel. One trial (<LINK REF="STD-Wu-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Wu 2010</LINK>) compared mifepristone with gestrinone. Other interventions were high-dose oestrogen, danazol and Cu-IUD. Anordrin is a steroid hormone with weak oestrogenic effects and is only used in China as a visiting-contraceptive pill (a type of oral pill that is used for couples who do not cohabit but visit home for a short period. It can start at any day during a menstrual cycle, one pill a day continuing no less than 14 days). In Chinese EC trials, investigators used locally manufactured mifepristone and levonorgestrel.</P>
<P>Two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Su-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Su 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wang-2000a" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2000a</LINK>) had three treatment arms (levonorgestrel versus mifepristone versus Cu-IUD) but the Cu-IUD comparison was not randomized.

<P>A total of 115 trials with 60,479 women met our inclusion criteria and were included in this review. Our main findings were as follows.</P>
<OL>
<LI>Evidence from six trials in 4750 women showed that the levonorgestrel regimen is more effective in preventing pregnancy than the Yuzpe regimen. However, since the Yuzpe regimen is a well-established method for emergency contraception, and in many countries is the only available emergency contraception method, Yuzpe should continue to be provided in these specific settings.</LI>
<LI>Evidence from 27 studies in 6052 women showed that effectiveness of mid-dose mifepristone regimens was probably better than that of levonorgestrel regimens to prevent unwanted pregnancy. Moreover, based on data from 14 trials in 8752 women, low-dose mifepristone (less than 25 mg) regimens were more effective than levonorgestrel regimens.</LI>
<LI>Evidence from 25 trials in 11,914 participants indicated that the mid-dose mifepristone regimens are more effective than the low-dose mifepristone regimens.</LI>
<LI>Three trials compared a 1.5 mg, single-dose levonorgestrel regimen with two doses of 0.75 mg levonorgestrel, 12 hours apart. The pooled data from 6653 women suggested that the effectiveness of the two regimens was similar.</LI>
<LI>One double-blinded, randomized, multicenter trial compared levonorgestrel split-dose 24 hours apart with levonorgestrel split-dose 12 hours apart. Findings from 2060 participants indicated that the effectiveness between the two split-dose regimens was probably similar.</LI>
<LI>Two trials compared effectiveness of UPA with that of levonorgestrel regimens. The UPA regimen was associated with fewer pregnancies than the levonorgestrel regimen.</LI>
<LI>There was insufficient evidence (data from two trials in 395 women) to determine the relative effectiveness of Cu-IUD compared with mifepristone. The evidence suggests that Cu-IUD may be more effective, but more data are required for this comparison.</LI>
<LI>Evidence from one trial in 300 women showed (as would be expected) that there was a higher number of pregnancies in the expectant management group than in the group of IUD users. This type of comparison is no longer considered ethical.</LI>
</OL>
<P>Altogether there were five cases of ectopic pregnancy out of 1153 pregnancies reported overall in the included 115 trials (0.4%). These occurred as follows: <LINK REF="STD-WHO-1999" TYPE="STUDY">WHO 1999</LINK> reported two cases after 50 mg mifepristone; <LINK REF="STD-Sang-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Sang 1999</LINK> reported one case after 10 mg mifepristone; and <LINK REF="STD-Su-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Su 2001</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-von-Hertzen-2002" TYPE="STUDY">von Hertzen 2002</LINK> reported one case each after split-dose of levonorgestrel.

<P>Nausea and vomiting occurred with oestrogen-containing EC methods. Progestogen and anti-progestogen methods caused changes in subsequent menses. All methods of EC appeared safe, and no serious adverse events were identified among EC users.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2017-07-20 10:56:06 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We have added 13 trials to the previous version of the review (<LINK REF="REF-Cheng-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cheng 2012</LINK>), and the number of included women in these studies has increased to 60,479 from 55,666 in <LINK REF="REF-Cheng-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cheng 2012</LINK>. All the included studies reported observed pregnancies as their primary outcome. However, studies often failed to report important secondary outcomes such as breast tenderness, headache, dizziness, fatigue, lower abdominal pain, diarrhoea, and spotting or bleeding after treatment.</P>
<P>We only identified three trials evaluating the effects of Cu-IUD to prevent unwanted pregnancy, and we rated their data quality as low. As pregnancy appears to be rare among women using Cu-IUD for EC and the side effects of Cu-IUD are well documented, Cu-IUD would seem to be particularly appropriate for women presenting too late for ECPs, provided they are not at risk of sexually transmitted diseases and prefer long-term contraception. Nevertheless, we need more well-designed studies to enable us to make a solid conclusion with regard to this.</P>
<P>We decided to exclude trials comparing emergency contraception pills with lactational amenorrhoea method (LAM). In practice, women who are breastfeeding are a unique group who are at high risk of unplanned pregnancy. Several trials have been undertaken that compare emergency contraception pills with LAM and that were excluded from our review. This comparison could be a useful topic for a future Cochrane Review.</P>
<P>We aim for the findings of this review to be applicable to women seeking services for EC following a single act of unprotected intercourse, and the included studies include women with wide range of ages, and ethnicities, from countries including Egypt, Italy, UK, Cuba and China. But there is a problem in that the methods and pills for emergency contraception were provided in differing manners by different countries and regions, and not all methods are universally available. In many countries and regions, the traditional Yuzpe regimen is still the only option available for emergency contraception. Problems with the availability and distribution of emergency contraception pills are the main factors limiting the applicability of our findings.</P>
<P>With respect to the influence of BMI on the effectiveness of EC, no data were reported by the primary studies. However, secondary analyses of randomized data from two RCTs included in our review (<LINK REF="STD-Creinin-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Creinin 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Glasier-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Glasier 2010</LINK>) suggested a fourfold increased risk of pregnancy after use of levonorgestrel ECP among obese women, compared with normal or underweight women (<LINK REF="REF-Glasier-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glasier 2011</LINK>). In women weighing about 80 kg, the rate of pregnancy rose above 6%, which is the estimated pregnancy probability without contraception (<LINK REF="REF-Kapp-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kapp 2015</LINK>). However secondary analysis of data from three other trials in our review (<LINK REF="STD-Dada-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Dada 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-von-Hertzen-2002" TYPE="STUDY">von Hertzen 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-WHO-1998" TYPE="STUDY">WHO 1998</LINK>) did not confirm that the efficacy of levonorgestrel decreased with increasing BMI (<LINK REF="REF-Gemzell_x002d_Danielsson-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gemzell-Danielsson 2015</LINK>). With respect to ulipristal, a secondary analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Moreau-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Moreau 2012</LINK>), which pooled data from one of the RCTs in our review (<LINK REF="STD-Glasier-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Glasier 2010</LINK>), and a non-randomised study (<LINK REF="REF-Fine-2010a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fine 2010a</LINK>), suggested that pregnancy rates in obese women might be double those in non-obese women, though confidence intervals were wide and the findings were not statistically significant. The findings of all these secondary analyses are discussed in a recent systematic review (<LINK REF="REF-Jatlaoui-2016a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jatlaoui 2016a</LINK>).</P>
<P>For this current update, we searched trials registers in order to identify new ongoing trials. We scrutinised reference lists of the new trials, only to find two trials that we had already included and three ongoing trials awaiting classification. Two of the ongoing trials compare ulipristal acetate with levonorgestrel IUS; and one compares Cu-IUD versus levonorgestrel IUD (see <LINK REF="STD-NCT01539720" TYPE="STUDY">NCT01539720</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-NCT02175030" TYPE="STUDY">NCT02175030</LINK>).</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2017-07-25 14:48:12 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="Helen E Nagels">
<P>We assessed the primary outcome and secondary outcomes with <LINK REF="REF-GRADEpro-GDT-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">GRADEpro GDT 2014</LINK> criteria. All the included trials were RCTs, which minimises the risk of bias associated with study design. The quality of the evidence for the primary outcome ranged from moderate to high, and for other outcomes ranged from very low to high. The main limitations were risk of bias (associated with poor reporting of randomization methods), imprecision and inconsistency.</P>
<P>For details of the quality of the evidence for each comparison, see <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>; <LINK REF="SOF-02" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 2</LINK>; <LINK REF="SOF-03" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 3</LINK>; <LINK REF="SOF-04" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 4</LINK>; <LINK REF="SOF-05" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 5</LINK>; <LINK REF="SOF-06" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 6</LINK>; <LINK REF="SOF-07" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 7</LINK>; and <LINK REF="SOF-08" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 8</LINK>.</P>
<P>We graded fewer than 15% of the studies (14/115) as being at low risk of bias randomization methods: these studies had detailed description of methods of sequence generation and allocation concealment. Moreover, we have included 92 Chinese trials. However, most of the trials only mentioned 'randomization' and did not report randomization methods in detail, making us uncertain about the possible risk of bias, which caused us to downgrade the quality of the evidence.</P>
<P>Another potentially important source of bias in these studies was loss to follow-up and missing outcome data. Only 31 studies, with an attrition of about 30%, clearly reported the reasons for attrition. Poor reporting of losses to follow-up is problematic, even with lower levels of attrition, particularly where loss is not balanced across different arms of trials.</P>
<P>We included a large number of trials (115) with a wide array of comparisons (26). The availability of several recent large multicenter trials was helpful in increasing the power and the generalisability of the study findings. However, RCTs with large sample sizes were relatively few. In addition, most of the included trials were conducted in China, in particular those evaluating the effects of mifepristone regimens. This is probably because few countries have approved mifepristone for use as EC, and China is the largest one. Since it was evident that ECs were effective, most recent studies on EC aimed to reduce dosage or times of medication administration so that clients' compliance or cost of treatment, or both, could be improved. Because of this reason, most recent EC trials were designed as equivalence rather than superiority studies (trying to show that two treatments are as good as each other rather than one is more effective than the other). It is common to claim an equivalent effectiveness when the difference between two treatment groups is not statistically significant. Nevertheless, few trials in this review calculated their sample sizes on the basis of an equivalence approach that usually requires a large study sample.</P>
<P>As noted above, for comparisons in which most of the studies failed to provide adequate details of their randomization methods, we did not downgrade the evidence for risk of bias if the analysis also included a large study at low risk of bias which had findings consistent with the smaller studies.</P>
<P>We did not downgrade the evidence for the primary outcome (pregnancy) for lack of blinding. Since pregnancy is an objective outcome, lack of blindness probably has little influence on evaluation of this outcome. We extracted information from the trials about other potential sources of bias in line with the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool.</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2017-07-20 10:56:19 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There may be potential biases at any stage of the review process. In order to minimise the risk of bias, two review authors independently screened studies for inclusion and any disagreements were resolved by a third review author. One review author performed data extraction and assessed risk of bias and a second review author checked them. Again, any discrepancies were resolved by a third review author. In this updated review, we assessed risk of bias for all the included 115 trials.</P>
<P>The key strengths of this review include exhaustive searches for literature about EC trials (including searches of the Chinese databases) and restriction to RCTs. Limiting the review to RCTs reduced the number of studies available, because, except for some regions where women have no alternatives for emergency contraception pills because of poor availability, most women do have a choice, and this tends to increase the difficulties of randomization. Hence, we found many observational trials, comparing the effectiveness of different ECPs. If this review had had broader inclusion criteria in relation to the type of study design, we would have included additional studies. However, we decided not to change our previous decision to exclude observational trials trials, to minimise the risk of bias in our review. Observational trials are at high risk of selection bias, which could influence the applicability of the result.</P>
<P>Another strength of this review is that we conducted additional analyses in order to assess problems associated with attrition. This consisted of simulated ITT analyses for the comparison of mid-dose mifepristone (25 mg to 50 mg) with levonorgestrel, assuming on the one hand that all women lost to follow-up in the levonorgestrel group had had an event, but none in the mifepristone group; or on the other hand assuming that the opposite was the case.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2017-06-30 21:26:05 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Levonorgestrel and mid-dose mifepristone (25 mg to 50 mg) were more effective than Yuzpe regimen (estradiol-levonorgestrel combination). Both mid-dose (25 mg to 50 mg) and low-dose mifepristone (less than 25 mg) were probably more effective than levonorgestrel (1.5 mg). Low-dose mifepristone (less than 25 mg) was less effective than mid-dose mifepristone. Ulipristal acetate (UPA) was more effective than levonorgestrel.</P>
<P>Levonorgestrel users had fewer side effects than Yuzpe users, and appeared to be more likely to have a menstrual return before the expected date. UPA users were probably more likely to have a menstrual return after the expected date. Menstrual delay was probably the main adverse effect of mifepristone and seemed to be dose-related. Copper intrauterine device (Cu-IUD) may be associated with higher risks of abdominal pain than emergency contraceptive pills (ECPs).</P>
<P>Emergency contraception (EC) should be offered to all women requesting this service. Women should start the method as soon as possible to maximise effectiveness, preferably within 72 hours of intercourse.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2017-06-30 22:08:36 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In order to demonstrate the relative effectiveness of UPA against levonorgestrel more data are needed. The effectiveness of levonorgestrel, UPA and mifepristone in relation to time since unprotected intercourse is not confirmed and more studies are needed. Moreover, the effectiveness of Cu-IUD for EC should be further evaluated. There is also a need to compare the effectiveness and safety of UPA and mifepristone (in countries where it is applicable) in order to provide evidence for clients and service providers. Studies are needed that investigate whether BMI influences the effectiveness of EC, and a review of the evidence on emergency contraception versus lactational amenorrhoea method would also be useful. Trial protocols should clearly state when equivalence is sought and trials should be powered accordingly. Most of the trials included in this review did not have sufficiently detailed reporting to enable satisfactory assessment of risk of bias. Future trials should report their methods in sufficient detail to allow this assessment.</P>

<P>Not an RCT<BR/>A total of 4945 women were recruited in 31 clinical centres in 18 provinces and municipalities in China in a descriptive clinical trial with 1 dose (Mife 10 mg) treatment. 28 cases lost to follow-up. An analysis of 4917 cases showed a pregnancy rate of 1.4% (95% CI 1.1% to 1.8%) and an effectiveness of prevention of pregnancy of 82.2% (95% CI 77.5% to 86.2%). No trend of increase of pregnancies with delay of treatment was found. Increase of risk of pregnancy in women who had unprotected intercourse after treatment is about 11.1 times higher. Side effects were mild and in small proportion of women, such as nausea and vomiting in 9.2% and other side effects in 0.7% to 3.7% of women.

<P>Study conducted in Milan, Italy, which started reporting in 1986. The first report refers to an ongoing randomised trial comparing ethinyl oestradiol-norgestrel combination (Yuzpe regimen) to danazol 800 mg in 835 women. Subsequently, it is reported that 1000 women were randomised and, afterwards, a third group (danazol 1200 mg) comparison was added. There was no report from which the results for the 1000 women randomised to Yuzpe and danazol 800 mg can be extracted. In subsequent reports in 1988 and 1990, the results are reported with randomised and non-randomised groups together and, therefore, this study has been excluded from analysis</P>

<P>Comment: These comments relate to the Full(1888K) pdf version of the Review.<BR/>
<BR/>I have been using this review for teaching purposes (with our undergraduate public health students) and I have noticed problems with the labelling of some Figures in the review and with the text accompanying these Figures.<BR/>
<BR/>Specifically, on page 12, Section 5 is entitled "Mid-dose mifepristone (25-50mg) versus LNG". However, in the accompanying Figure 4, the Forest Plot is labelled as follows: "Forest Plot of comparison: 5 Levonorgestrel 1.5mg versus mifepristone mid-dose (25-50mg)." This label appears to incorrectly imply that the data presented in the Forest Plot for the "Treatment group" in each trial relates to Levonorgestrel (rather than to mid-dose mifepristone). This mis-labelling could potentially result in the reader misinterpreting the pooled estimate on the Forest Plot. Could the review authors please examine Figure 4 and consider changing the label to: "Forest plot of comparison: 5 Mifepristone mid-dose (25-50mg) versus Levonorgestrel 1.5mg".<BR/>
<BR/>On page 12, Section 6 is entitled "low-dose mifepristone (&lt;25mg) versus LNG". However, in the accompanying Figure 5, the Forest Plot is labelled as follows: "Forest Plot of comparison: 6 Levonorgestrel 1.5mg versus mifepristone low dose (&lt;25mg)." Could the review authors examine Figure 5 and consider changing the label to: "Forest plot of comparison: 6 Mifepristone low dose (&lt;25mg) versus Levonorgestrel 1.5mg".<BR/>
<BR/>In the text accompanying section 6 "Low-dose mifepristone (&lt;25mg) versus LNG" the following sentences appear: "Nine Chinese....one UK....and one multinational WHO trial....compared LNG (4856 women) with low-dose mifepristone (3480 women). There was a statistically significant difference in effectiveness between LNG and low-dose mifepristone regimens when all studies were included (RR 0.70; 95% CI 0.50 to 0.97)".<BR/>It is my understanding that, when presenting comparisons in the text of the review, the 'Treatment' group should be compared with the 'Control' group (i.e. low-dose mifepristone should be compared with LNG and not vice-versa). The statements that currently appear in the text accompanying section 6 incorrectly imply that levonorgestrel is more effective than low-dose mifepristone, whereas the opposite is in fact the case. Could the review authors examine the text in Section 6 and consider altering the text as follows: "Nine Chinese....one UK....and one multinational WHO trial....compared low-dose mifepristone (3480 women) with LNG (4856 women). There was a statistically significant difference in effectiveness between low-dose mifepristone and LNG regimens when all studies were included (RR 0.70; 95% CI 0.50 to 0.97)".<BR/>
<BR/>I have not examined all figures and the accompanying text throughout the entire review but perhaps the review authors could consider double-checking all Figures and any accompanying text to ensure that no similar issues arise elsewhere in the review.<BR/>
<BR/>Best wishes<BR/>Paul<BR/>

<P>Dear Anja and Frans,</P>
<P>Thanks very much for your email and the comments from Paul. Paul's comments is complete right. There are mistakes in the Caption of<BR/>Forest plot of comparison in <LINK REF="FIG-04" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 4</LINK> - 9.</P>
<P>According the suggestion of peer reviewer, we had to use LNG as the control for all another EC-drug study. So that we rewrote Section 5-7 in the text and re-enter the data for statistical analysis, but we forgot change the Caption of Forest plot of comparison in Figue 5 - 9. I am terrible sorry for those mistakes. We are happy to double-check all the Figures and any accompanying test again to ensure that no similar mistakes arise elsewhere in our review. Would we do it by Archie system?<BR/>Please send our sincere thanks to Paul.</P>
<P>With all the best.</P>
<P>Linan</P>

<P>
<B>Comments on: update of Review Number 0003 &#8211; Interventions for emergency contraception</B>
</P>
<P>
<B>1)</B> Many of the Summary of Findings (SoF) Tables contain more than the recommended number of outcomes (some SoF tables contain 20 outcomes). The Cochrane Handbook (Section 11.5.6.2) recommends that SoF Tables should contain a <U>maximum of seven outcomes</U>[1]. The review authors will need to decide what outcomes are essential for decision-making and will need to omit the less important outcomes from the SoF tables. Where feasible and appropriate, the review authors may wish to consider including a composite outcome for side effects (i.e. &#8220;<I>any side effect</I>&#8221;) in the SoF tables rather than reporting on individual side effects.</P>
<P>Response:</P>
<P>We kept the essential outcomes and omitted the less important outcomes according to the main results. Now every SoF tables contains no more than 7 outcomes.</P>
<P>As for the side effects, we can&#8217;t make a composite outcome for side effects (i.e. &#8220;<I>any side effect</I>&#8221;) for all the comparisons because we wanted to keep the main observation of the original articles. Some articles reported on detailed individual side effects. But, we omitted the less important side effects and only kept the main side effects in the SoF tables.</P>
<P>
<B>2)</B> The updated review currently contains 31 Summary of Findings (SoF) Tables and there is a serious risk of overwhelming the reader with information. I would suggest that the review authors consider only including SoF tables for the <I>main comparisons</I> made in the review (<I>e.g. </I>for the comparisons that are specified in the Abstract of the review).</P>
<P>Response:</P>
<P>We changed the 31 comparisons to 18 comparisons, remaining the main results.</P>
<P>
<B>3)</B> The review authors have not used a consistent format for the Summary of Findings (SoF) Tables. For example, in SoF Tables 1, 8 and 9 (and in several other tables) the Relative Effect (95% CI) appears in the second column of the Table. However, the relative effect is presented in a different column in Tables 2, 3 and 4 (and in several other tables). To avoid confusing the reader, it would be advisable to use the same format for all of the SoF Tables (I would suggest using the format adopted in Tables 2, 3 and 4).</P>
<P>Response:</P>
<P>We re-checked all the SoF tables and formatted all the tables.</P>
<P>
<B>4)</B> Incorrect symbols for the <LINK REF="REF-GRADEpro-GDT-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">GRADEpro GDT 2014</LINK> ratings have been used in several of the Summary of Findings (SoF) Tables (<I>e.g</I>. SoF tables 6, 8, 9 and many other tables in the pdf version of the review) . The review authors should use the following symbols consistently in all SoF tables.</P>

<P>
<B>5)</B> In Summary of Findings Table 6 - Mifepristone low dose (&lt;25mg) versus Levonorgestrel 1.5mg ( pages 89-93 of the pdf version of the review) the results presented for the primary outcome do not match the results presented in the Abstract, the main text of the review and in the Forest plot (Figure 5.1). The relative risk estimate presented in the Summary of Findings Table is 1.44 (95% CI 1.03 to 2.01) and is apparently based on 11 trials with 8336 participants. The correct relative risk estimate (according to other sections of the review) is 0.72 (95% CI 0.52 to 0.99) and is based on a meta-analysis of 14 trials with 8752 participants. I would advise the review authors to re-check all of the relative risk estimates in all other Summary of Findings Tables to ensure that no similar errors have occurred elsewhere.</P>
<P>Response:</P>
<P>Well-checked and made the revision.</P>
<P>
<B>6)</B> The footnotes in the Summary of Findings (SoF) Tables are insufficiently clear and require some additional detail to enhance clarity (several footnotes consist of a single word). For example, one reason for downgrading is given in several tables as &#8220;ACS&#8221; (e.g. see SoF table 10 [outcome 1 &#8211; observed number of pregnancies]). I could not find any definition of the abbreviation &#8220;ACS&#8221; in the review, but I presume it may refer to Allocation Concealment Score. The footnotes should include sufficient detail to allow the reader to understand why the review team have downgraded the body of evidence for a specific outcome (see the attached documents from the Cochrane Editorial Unit). Furthermore, the reasons for downgrading should be directly linked to the <LINK REF="REF-GRADEpro-GDT-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">GRADEpro GDT 2014</LINK> factors that can reduce the quality of evidence (risk of bias, inconsistency of results, indirectness of evidence, imprecision, publication bias). In this context, instead of saying &#8220;ACS&#8221; in SoF table 10 for outcome 1, a more appropriate and sufficiently informative footnote would be something like &#8220;<I>The quality of evidence was downgraded by one level for &#8220;risk of bias&#8221; because allocation concealment was judged to be adequate in only six trials included in the meta-analysis&#8221;</I>
</P>
<P>Response:</P>
<P>We made the revision of all the footnotes.</P>
<P>
<B>7)</B> Several footnotes cite &#8220;<I>Sample Size</I>&#8221; and &#8220;<I>CI overlaps 1.00</I>&#8221; as reasons for downgrading the body of evidence. Sample size and confidence intervals for relative effect measures including the value of &#8216;no effect&#8217; are not sufficient reasons for downgrading the quality of evidence for imprecision. The <LINK REF="REF-GRADEpro-GDT-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">GRADEpro GDT 2014</LINK> manual suggests that review authors should consider downgrading for imprecision if either <B>1) </B>the total (cumulative) sample size is lower than the calculated optimal information size (OIS) or <B>2)</B> the 95% confidence interval around the pooled or best estimate of effect includes both <I>a)</I> no effect <U>and</U> <I>b)</I> &#8220;appreciable benefit&#8221; or &#8220;appreciable harm&#8221;. The suggested <LINK REF="REF-GRADEpro-GDT-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">GRADEpro GDT 2014</LINK> threshold for &#8220;appreciable benefit&#8221; or &#8220;appreciable harm&#8221; that should be considered for downgrading is a relative risk reduction or relative risk increase greater than 25%. However,<U> if there are very few or no events and the number of participants is large, judgements about imprecision may be based on the absolute (rather than the relative) effect measures</U>. Wide confidence intervals around a relative risk effect estimate may translate to clinically small differences in absolute effects. For example, in a trial with 500 participants in the experimental group and 500 participants in the control group, if 2 events occur in the experimental group (event rate 0.4%) and if three events occur in the control group (event rate 0.6%), then the relative risk (RR) will be 0.67 (95% CI 0.11, 3.97) but the risk difference (RD) (or absolute risk reduction ) will be -0.2% (95% CI -1%, +1%). In this example, the confidence interval around the absolute effect measure may be deemed sufficiently precise to warrant <U>not </U>downgrading the evidence (if review authors are happy that a 1% absolute difference in either direction would not constitute &#8220;appreciable benefit&#8221; or &#8220;appreciable harm&#8221;).</P>
<P>In the review of emergency contraceptives several trials have reasonably large sample sizes and few events and therefore I would suggest that the review authors consider basing their decisions about imprecision, where appropriate, on the absolute effect measures rather than the relative effect measures.</P>
<P>Response:</P>
<P>For those observations with few events such as &#8220;the observed pregnancies in all women&#8221;, we graded about imprecision on the absolute effect measures rather than the relative effect measures.</P>
<P>
<B>8)</B> The reasons for downgrading (and not downgrading) the quality of evidence for outcomes do not appear to be consistent throughout the review. For example, in Summary of Findings Table 1, p78 of the pdf file, (IUD versus expectant management), a &#8220;high&#8221; quality of evidence rating is given for the outcome &#8220;observed number of pregnancies&#8221;. This finding is based on one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Askalani-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Askalani 1987</LINK>) which was judged to have a &#8216;high risk of bias&#8217; due to &#8216;inadequate allocation concealment&#8217;(see p18 of pdf file). In other Summary of Findings Tables the quality of evidence for the outcome &#8220;observed number of pregnancies&#8221; is downgraded for &#8216;risk of bias&#8217; due to inadequate allocation concealment. The review authors should re-check their ratings of the quality of evidence for all outcomes to ensure that <LINK REF="REF-GRADEpro-GDT-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">GRADEpro GDT 2014</LINK> is applied consistently throughout the review.</P>
<P>Response:</P>
<P>We double-checked all the evidence for all outcomes and for sure that <LINK REF="REF-GRADEpro-GDT-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">GRADEpro GDT 2014</LINK> is applied consistently throughout the review.</P>
<P>9) The review authors do not mention <LINK REF="REF-GRADEpro-GDT-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">GRADEpro GDT 2014</LINK> in the Abstract. In the &#8220;Data collection and analysis&#8221; section of the Abstract the review authors should state that they rated the quality of evidence using the <LINK REF="REF-GRADEpro-GDT-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">GRADEpro GDT 2014</LINK> system. In addition, the <LINK REF="REF-GRADEpro-GDT-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">GRADEpro GDT 2014</LINK> ratings should be incorporated into the &#8220;Main results&#8221; section of the Abstract. The review authors may find the attached pdf. document from the Cochrane Editorial Unit helpful when redrafting the Results section of the Abstract The document describes how <LINK REF="REF-GRADEpro-GDT-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">GRADEpro GDT 2014</LINK> can be incorporated into various sections of a Cochrane review, including the Abstract, and provides some &#8220;good practice examples&#8221; from completed Cochrane reviews. I have also attached a worksheet developed by the Cochrane EPOC group which gives helpful suggestions regarding the language that review authors can use when describing the results of their review in the Abstract (and in other sections of a Cochrane review) - they recommend use of the term &#8216;probably&#8217; for moderate-quality evidence and &#8216;may&#8217; for &#8216;low-quality evidence&#8217; [An example that incorporates the suggestions made by the CEU and the EPOC group would be: Mid-dose mifepristone (25-50 mg) probablyprevents more pregnancies than levonorgestrel (RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.47 to 0.88, 26 trials, 5940 participants, moderate-quality evidence)].</P>
<P>Response:</P>
<P>We incorporated all the <LINK REF="REF-GRADEpro-GDT-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">GRADEpro GDT 2014</LINK> ranting into the &#8220;main result&#8221; and &#8220;Abstract&#8221; sections.</P>
<P>10) In the Abstract the review authors state that &#8220;<I>Low dose-mifepristone was less effective than mid-dose mifepristone (25 trials; RR 0.73 (95% CI 0.55 to 0.97</I>)&#8221;. The relative risk estimate presented by the review authors relates to the comparison between mid-dose mifepristone <I>versus </I>low-dose mifepristone (not low-dose <I>versus </I>mid-dose) and therefore it would be more appropriate to state that mid-dose mifepristone was more effective than low-dose mifepristone (NOTE: also see comments above regarding the incorporation of <LINK REF="REF-GRADEpro-GDT-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">GRADEpro GDT 2014</LINK> ratings into the Abstract).</P>
<P>Response:</P>
<P>We made the relevant revision.</P>
<P>11) In the Abstract it is stated that: &#8220;<I>Cu-IUD were significantly more effective than mid-dose Miferpistone (2 trials, RR 3.01, 95% CI 0.36 to 24.76) and LNG (1 trial, RR 1.89, 95% CI 1.05 to 3.38</I>)&#8221; [sic]. There are several problems with this sentence. Firstly, the difference between Cu-IUD and mid-dose Mifepristone was not statistically significant. Secondly, for the comparison between Cu-IUD and LNG, the review authors judged the quality of evidence to be &#8220;very low&#8221; for the outcome of pregnancy. If the quality of the evidence is &#8220;very low&#8221; this means that there is considerable uncertainty over the effect estimate and therefore no conclusions can be drawn about the relative effectiveness of the two interventions. Finally, as the outcome is pregnancy, the manner in which the results are presented suggest that the Cu-IUD resulted in more pregnancies than mid-dose Mifepristone and LNG (both RRs are &gt;1.00). I would suggest that the review authors amend comparison 21 (page 13 of the pdf file) and any accompanying analyses to compare Cu-IUD <I>versus </I>mid-dose mifepristone (and not mid-dose mifepristone <I>versus</I> Cu-IUD). This will ensure that the calculated relative risk estimates are &lt;1.00 and will ensure consistency with the format of presentation of other results in the Abstract (<I>i.e.</I> the entry in the Abstract should be: Cu-IUD may prevent more pregnancies than mid-dose mifepristone (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.04 to 2.74); two trials, 395 participants, low-quality evidence). The review authors should also amend comparison 26 to compare Cu-IUD <I>versus</I> LNG.</P>
<P>Response:</P>
<P>We revised the explanation on Cu-IUD after deep discussion and also amended the comparison 21 and 26 as suggested.</P>
<P>13) In the Authors&#8217; conclusions section of the Abstract it is stated that &#8220;<I>The copper IUD was the most effective EC method</I>&#8230;.&#8221;. This conclusion does not appear to be justified based on the evidence presented in the &#8220;<I>Main results</I>&#8221; section in the Abstract.</P>
<P>Response:</P>
<P>Agree. We rephrased the conclusion on Cu-IUD.</P>
<P>14) The review authors could improve the format of the Discussion (pages 14-16 of the pdf file) by using the standard headings recommended for the discussion section of Cochrane reviews (i.e. Summary of main results; Overall completeness and applicability of the evidence; Quality of the evidence; Potential biases in the review process; Agreements and disagreements with other studies or reviews).</P>
<P>Response:</P>
<P>We have rewritten the discussion section using the standard headings recommended.</P>
<P>15) In the &#8220;Implications for Practice&#8221; section of the review (page 16 of the pdf file) the review authors should delete the phrase &#8216;<I>strong recommendation</I>&#8217; which appears on two occasions in this section of the review. Grading of the strength of recommendations should only be done by guideline development groups after considering the balance of desirable and undesirable consequences, quality of evidence, values and preferences and resource issues. These matters are beyond the remit of a systematic review and the Cochrane handbook (section 12.7.2) advises that &#8220;<I>Authors of Cochrane reviews should not make recommendations</I>&#8221;.</P>
<P>Response:</P>
<P>We have rewritten this section.</P>
<P>16) In the Background it is stated that &#8220;<I>Examining data from 45 countries who most recent survey occurred between 2000 and 2012, in 16 countries, the percentage of women aged 15-49 was less than 10%; in 36 countries, the rate of use of EC was less than 3% among women who had ever had sex (</I>

<I>)&#8221; </I>[sic] . The first part of this sentence (highlighted in red) is very unclear and the review authors will need to rephrase it to enhance clarity.</P>
<P>Response:</P>
<P>This sentence was corrected.</P>
<P>Paul Beirne, 10-12-15</P>
<P>[1] Section 11.5.6.2 states that &#8220;The rows of a Summary of Findings Table should include all desirable and undesirable outcomes (listed in order of importance), that are essential for decision &#8211;making, up to a maximum of seven outcomes. If there are an excessive number of outcomes in the review authors will need to omit the less important outcomes&#8221;.</P>
