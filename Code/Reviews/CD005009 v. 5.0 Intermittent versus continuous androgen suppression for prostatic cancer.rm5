<SUMMARY>
<TITLE>To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of intermittent androgen suppression compared to continuous androgen suppression for treating prostatic cancer.</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>After lung cancer, prostate cancer is the most common cause of death among males. The American Cancer Society estimates that 234,460 new cases of prostate cancer were diagnosed, and 27,350 men died from this disease in the United States in 2006 (ACS 2006). Treatment for early stage prostate cancer that is believed to be confined to the prostate gland include: radical prostatectomy, external beam or interstitial radiation therapy, and watchful waiting. Androgen suppression therapy (AST) to reduce circulating serum testosterone and disease progression is considered a mainstay of treatment for men with advanced prostate cancer. </P>
<P>Five studies involving 1382 patients were included in this review. All the included studies involved advanced (T3 or T4) prostate cancer. No study was of adequate size and duration. Few events were reported and they did not assess disease-specific survival or metastatic disease. Only one study evaluated biochemical outcomes. Studies primarily reported on adverse events. There are no data for the relative effectiveness of IAS versus CAS for overall survival, prostate cancer specific survival, disease progression, or quality of life. Limited information suggests IAS may have slightly reduced adverse events. In Hering 2000, IAS (18/25 versus 18/18) appears to be slightly more favorable than CAS in controlling impotence. Overall, IAS was also as effective as CAS for potency, but was superior during the interval of cycles (96%). More research is needed.</P>

</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>After lung cancer, prostate cancer is the most common cause of death among males. The aim of treatment is to prevent disease-related morbidity and mortality while minimizing intervention-related adverse events. Androgen suppression therapy (AST) to reduce circulating serum testosterone and disease progression is considered a mainstay of treatment for men with advanced prostate cancer. It has been increasingly utilized for early stage disease despite a lack of evidence of effectiveness.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>Evaluate the effectiveness and safety of intermittent androgen suppression (IAS) compared to continuous androgen suppression for treating prostatic cancer.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>The following databases were searched to identify randomised or quasi-randomised, controlled trials comparing intermittent and continuous androgen suppression in the treatment of any stage of prostate cancer: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials; EMBASE and LILACS. </P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Studies were included if they were randomised or quasi-randomized, and compare the effects of IAS versus CAS.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Two reviewers selected relevant trials, assessed methodological quality and extracted data.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Five randomized studies involving 1382 patients were included in this review. All the included studies involved advanced (T3 or T4) prostate cancer, had relatively small populations, and were of short duration. Few events were reported and did not assess disease-specific survival or metastatic disease. Only one study (N = 77) evaluated biochemical outcomes. A subgroup analysis found no significant differences in biochemical progression (defined by the authors as PSA &#8805; 10 ng/mL) between IAS and CAS for Gleason scores 4 - 6, 7, and 8 - 10. For patients with a Gleason score &gt; 6, reduction in biochemical progression favoured the IAS group (RR 0.10, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.67, P = 0.02). Studies primarily reported on adverse events. One trial (N = 43) found no difference in adverse effects (gastrointestinal, gynecomastia and asthenia) between IAS ( two events) and CAS (five events), with the exception of impotence, which was significantly lower in the IAS group (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.56 to 0.92, P = 0.008).</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>Data from RCTs comparing IAS to CAS are limited by small sample size and short duration. There are no data for the relative effectiveness of IAS versus CAS for overall survival, prostate cancer-specific survival, or disease progression. Limited information suggests IAS may have slightly reduced adverse events. Overall, IAS was also as effective as CAS for potency, but was superior during the interval of cycles (96%).</P>

</ABSTRACT>
<BODY>
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Prostate cancer is the second most common cause of death in males with tumours; lung cancer ranks first. The American Cancer Society estimates that 234,460 new cases of prostate cancer will be diagnosed, and 27,350 men will die from this disease in the United States in 2006 (<LINK REF="REF-ACS-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">ACS 2006</LINK>). The aim of treatment is to cure local tumours, traditionally through radical prostatectomy or definitive radiation therapy. For clinically localised disease, androgen blockade has become increasingly popular (<LINK REF="REF-Labrie-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Labrie 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>Androgen suppression therapy is considered one mainstay of treatment for men with advanced prostate cancer. This suppression may be achieved by surgical or medical castration (ie, with Luteinizing Hormone-Releasing Hormone (LHRH), antiandrogens, or orchiectomy alone, or in combination). Hormone dependence of prostate cancer was established by Huggins (<LINK REF="REF-Huggins-1941" TYPE="REFERENCE">Huggins 1941</LINK>) over fifty years ago. It is estimated that androgen suppression reduces tumour volume, improves symptoms, and delays progression in more than 80% of patients; however, it poses serious limitations since it is a palliative therapy, and may reduce quality of life. The tumour may become hormone refractory over a period ranging from 18 to 36 months. Roughly 20% of these cases stay in remission for 5 years, depending on the initial volume of the tumour and presence of hormone-sensitive cell clones (<LINK REF="REF-Bruchovsky-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bruchovsky 1990</LINK>).</P>
<P>The use of hormonal therapy is typically continuous and maintained until the disease progresses, or the patient dies. Intermittent androgen suppression has been proposed as a viable treatment option for selected patients with prostate cancer. These patients are treated cyclically, which corresponds to hormonal therapy plus off-therapy time. For each cycle, androgen deprivation is continued until the PSA becomes undetectable or a nadir level is reached. Patients are then observed without treatment, and therapy is reinstituted after the serum PSA reaches a predetermined level. Patients are no longer eligible to cycle off-treatment if their serum PSA is increasing despite ongoing androgen deprivation, or if any objective evidence of disease progression is present in imaging studies.</P>
<P>The idea of keeping hormone-sensitive clones competing in the tumour could enable some strategic advances and setbacks in eliminating cell populations, promoting a tumour cytoreduction in treatment periods and resettlement of hormone-sensitive cells in the off-treatment phase (<LINK REF="REF-Akakura-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Akakura 1993</LINK>). These cells competing with hormone-resistant clones could prevent occupation of the tumour by resistant elements and would maintain hormone dependence for longer periods (<LINK REF="REF-Bladou-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bladou 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rennie-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rennie 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sato-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sato 1995</LINK>). Therefore, based on these studies, the concept of intermittent androgen suppression was introduced in clinical treatment with the aim of decreasing morbidity, improving quality of life, and eventually, extending survival. IAS could also potentially lower costs and treatment-related adverse events, including hot flushes, gynecomastia and osteoporosis.</P>
<P>In 1986, Klotz (<LINK REF="STD-Klotz-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Klotz 2005</LINK>) reported the first clinical use of intermittent hormonal therapy. This was followed by several phase II (<LINK REF="REF-Bruchovsky-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bruchovsky 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Goldenberg-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Goldenberg 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Higano-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Higano 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Oliver-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Oliver 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Grossfeld-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grossfeld 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Theyer-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Theyer 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Horwich-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Horwich 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Crook-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Crook 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kurek-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Kurek 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rambeaud-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rambeaud 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Strum-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Strum 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bouchot-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Bouchot 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hering-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Hering 2000</LINK>) and some phase III clinical trials (<LINK REF="REF-Carneiro-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carneiro 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Waltregny-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Waltregny 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Calais-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Calais 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-EAU-TULP-2002" TYPE="STUDY">EAU TULP 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>Although intermittent androgen suppression is attractive, its use is controversial. Most studies have enrolled relatively few participants, and included primarily disseminated metastatic disease. However, intermittent androgen suppression has also been used in patients without evidence of metastases who failed definite therapy, such as radical prostatectomy, and, or including, radiation therapy (<LINK REF="STD-De-La-Taille-2003" TYPE="STUDY">De La Taille 2003</LINK>) as measured by rising serum PSA levels. Nevertheless, these benefits - if they exist - must be confirmed by well designed, randomised, clinical trials using valid quality-of-life tools.</P>

<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>Patients will be eligible, regardless of any tumour stage or grade, if they have prostate cancer and have not received prior androgen suppression therapy. Patients with localised disease are those classified as T1-2, N0, M0. Subjects with advanced prostate cancer may be with node (N1,M1c), visceral (M1c), and bone metastases (M1b), or presenting with biochemical recurrence after local treatment. Patients with advanced prostate cancer clinical stage T3 or T4, or pathological stage T3 or T4, may also be included in this category if they have not received prior androgen suppression. Patients will be stratified according to initial treatment (ie, surgery, radiation, and brachytherapy).</P>

<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>
<BR/>1) intermittent androgen suppression, including LHRH, androgen ablation (AA) and maximum androgen blockade (MAB) (or combination therapy), and<BR/>2) continuous androgen suppression, including orchiectomy, LHRH, AA, and MAB, were instituted as follows:<BR/>

<LI>the intermittent androgen suppression should be withdrawn in patients who develop hormone resistance, characterised by PSA &gt; 50 ng/mL, or in those with clinical progression of the disease with new metastases.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<BR/>The androgen blockade will be considered biochemically effective when testosterone concentrations achieve castration levels, or when patients achieve a PSA nadir before completing a six-month treatment with the blockade. Androgen suppression may be performed by bilateral orchiectomy, estrogens, Luteinizing Hormone-Releasing Hormone analogues (LHRHa), steroidal anti-androgens, or non-steroidal anti-androgens.</P>

<SEARCH_METHODS>
<P>See Cochrane Prostatic Diseases and Urologic Cancers Group.</P>
<P>ELECTRONIC SEARCH<BR/>The following databases were searched to identify randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing intermittent and continuous androgen suppression in the treatment of advanced prostate cancer: The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (2002 - 2006); MEDLINE (1966 - 2006); EMBASE (1980 - 2006); and LILACS (1982 - 2006).</P>
<P>The optimal MEDLINE, EMBASE and LILACS sensitive strategies for identification of RCTs (<LINK REF="REF-Dickersin-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dickersin 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Castro-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Castro 1997</LINK>) were combined with the following phrases:</P>
<P>#1 hormone blockade OR hormone therapy OR intermittent androgen suppression OR antiandrogen OR diethylstilbestrol OR LHRH OR luteinising hormone-releasing hormone OR flutamide OR bicalutamide or cyproterone OR leuprolide OR nilutamide OR orchiectomy<BR/>#2 prostat* cancer OR metastat* prostat * OR prostat* carcinoma</P>
<P>REFERENCE LISTS<BR/>The reference list of the identified studies was checked for additional citations.</P>
<P>PERSONAL CONTACT<BR/>Pharmaceutical companies, study authors and experts were contacted about unpublished data.</P>
<P>Information about ongoing clinical trials was sought by searching the new clinical trials site from the National Institute of Health (<U>http://clinicaltrials.gov</U>).</P>
</SEARCH_METHODS>
<DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>1. Selection of trials and data management <BR/>Reviewers screened the title and abstracts of publications obtained by the search strategy. When the study fulfilled the inclusion criteria, data concerning methods of the trial, participant characteristics (age, stage, grade, initial PSA, nadir PSA, and puromycin-sensitive aminopeptidases at time of initiation of androgen suppression), intervention details, and outcome measures, were independently extracted using a standard extraction form. When a discrepancy occurred in trial selection the opinion of another reviewer was asked to reach consensus.</P>
<P>2. Assessment of methodological quality</P>
<P>2.1. The internal validity of individual trials were assessed using the scale devised by Jadad et al (<LINK REF="REF-Jadad-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jadad 1996</LINK>), which were analysed as follows:</P>
<P>(1) Was the study described as randomised? (1 = yes; 0 = no);<BR/>(2) Was the method of randomisation well described and adequate? (0 = not described; 1 = described and adequate; -1 = described, but not adequate);<BR/>(3) Was the study described as double-blind? (1 = yes; 0 = no);<BR/>(4) Was the method of double blinding well described and adequate? (0 = not described; 1 = describe and adequate; -1 = described, but not adequate);<BR/>(5) Was there a description of withdrawals and dropouts sufficient to determine the number of patients in each treatment group entering and completing the trial? (1 = yes; 0 = no).</P>
<P>Each trial thus received a score of 0 to 5 points, with higher scores indicating higher quality in trail conduction or reporting.</P>
<P>2.2 Methodological quality of included trials was also assessed according to the Cochrane Handbook criteria (<LINK REF="REF-Clarke-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clarke 2003</LINK>). The categories of the described criteria are related to allocation concealment as<BR/>A. adequate, B. unclear, C. inadequate, and D. not used.</P>
<P>3. Data analysis</P>
<P>3.1 Categorical data</P>
<P>Relative risks (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated for dichotomous data using an intention-to-treat principle (we assumed that people who dropped out had negative outcomes - death was treated independently).</P>
<P>3.2 Continuous data</P>
<P>Weighted mean differences (WMD) with 95% CI were calculated for continuous data. We used a fixed-effects model unless heterogeneity was present. Heterogeneity was defined as chi square &gt; 0.10.<BR/>
<BR/>Data on continuous outcomes are frequently skewed and the mean is not the centre of the distribution. Statistics for meta-analysis are thought to be able to cope with some skew, but were formulated for parametric data. To avoid this potential pitfall, the following standards were applied to all data before inclusion: (a) standard deviations and means were reported or obtained from authors; and (b) for data with finite limits, such as endpoint scale data, the standard deviation (SD), when multiplied by two, was less than the mean. Otherwise the mean is unlikely to be an appropriate measure of the centre of the distribution (<LINK REF="REF-Altman-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Altman 1996</LINK>). Only non-skewed data were presented in this review.</P>
<P>3.3 Subgroup analyses</P>
<P>Age: less than 60 years old versus 60 years or older<BR/>Race: black versus non-black<BR/>Histologic grade: Gleason Score: &lt; 7 versus &#8805; 7<BR/>Nadir PSA (defined as the lowest PSA level after hormonal therapy)<BR/>Previous treatment: RP, EBRT, brachytherapy<BR/>Tumor stage<BR/>Types of androgen suppression (LHRHa, MAB, AA)</P>
<P>3.4 Sensitivity analyses</P>
<P>Randomised versus quasi-randomised controlled trials</P>
<P>4. Heterogeneity</P>
<P>Heterogeneity was assessed by the chi-squared test, and assumed to be present when significance was less than 0.1 (P &lt; 0.10). When significant heterogeneity was present, an attempt was made to explain the differences based on the clinical and methodological characteristics of the included studies.</P>
<P>5. Addressing publication bias</P>
<P>To assess publication bias, a funnel graph was constructed (trial effect versus trial size).</P>

<BR/>The MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL and LILACS search retrieved approximately 3110 potential studies for inclusion, of which 146 were selected for abstract reading and 35 were selected for full reading. Three thousand seventy-six studies did not meet the inclusion criteria. The most common reasons were the studies were not about intermittent or continuous androgen suppression, or the studies were not about adenocarcinoma. Of the 35 papers selected for full reading, 21 were rejected and can be viewed in the 'Characteristics of excluded studies' (<LINK REF="STD-Bouchot-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Bouchot 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Crook-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Crook 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-De-La-Taille-2003" TYPE="STUDY">De La Taille 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Goldenberg-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Goldenberg 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Goldenberg-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Goldenberg 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Grossfeld-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Grossfeld 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gulley-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Gulley 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Higano-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Higano 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Horwich-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Horwich 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hussain-2006-_x0028_SWOG_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Hussain 2006 (SWOG)</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Klotz-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Klotz 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Klotz-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Klotz 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Klotz-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Klotz 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kurek-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Kurek 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lane-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Lane 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mottet-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Mottet 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Oliver-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Oliver 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sato-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Sato 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sciarra-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Sciarra 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Strum-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Strum 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Theyer-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Theyer 1998</LINK>). The reason for exclusion was that none of the studies compared intermittent androgen suppression to continuous androgen suppression. These studies only eventually tested the feasibility of using IAS. Five papers were eventually included (<LINK REF="STD-Calais-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Calais 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-de-Leval-2002" TYPE="STUDY">de Leval 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-EAU-TULP-2002" TYPE="STUDY">EAU TULP 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hering-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Hering 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yamanaka-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Yamanaka 2005</LINK>), which described prospective, randomised trials.

<B>Participants and duration of trials</B>
<BR/>In <LINK REF="STD-Hering-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Hering 2000</LINK>, 43 patients with adenocarcinoma of the prostate (stage D2) were randomised to the following arms. In the continuous group patients were classified as T3,Nx,M+ (4 patients), T3,N+,M+ (2 patients), T4,N+,M+ (8 patients), and T4,Nx,M+ (4 patients). In the intermittent group patients were classified as T3,Nx,M+ (10 patients), T3,N+,M+ (4 patients), T4,N+,M+ (9 patients), and T4,Nx,M+ (2 patients). Mean age in the CAS treated patients 70.1; mean age in the IAS treated patients 72.4. Mean PSA (ng/mL) baseline in the CAS patients 32.3 and IAS patients 30.9 (cycle one), 17.1 (cycle two), 10.1 (cycle three). Follow up was 48 months.</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-EAU-TULP-2002" TYPE="STUDY">EAU TULP 2002</LINK>, 282 patients were enrolled to the study. Patients had histologically confirmed prostate cancer and PSA &#8805; 10 ng/mL. One hundred ninety-three patients who were still in the study after six months of maximal blockade and showed normalisation of PSA (&lt; 4 ng/mL) were randomised to continuous androgen suppression (n = 96) and intermittent androgen suppression (n = 97). One hundred fifty-five were classified as T2-4,Nx,M1 and 38 were T2-4,N1-3,M0. PSA and testosterone levels were analysed at least every 2 months, and patients were given radiological exams every 6 months. For the patients in the intermittent arm, therapy began when PSA rose to &#8805; 20 ng/mL and N0-3,M1, or &#8805; 10 ng/mL and N1-3,M0. When PSA fell to &lt; 4 ng/mL, therapy was discontinued. If PSA persisted above 50 ng/mL, or there was clinical progression, androgen suppression became continuous. The observation period of the patients was 26 to 40 months. The mean/median age was not reported.</P>
<P>In the <LINK REF="STD-Yamanaka-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Yamanaka 2005</LINK> study, 215 patients with locally advanced prostate cancer were enrolled. Patients were treated with 6 months of LHRH agonist and a short-term antiandrogen. Those who finished the protocol and had a PSA of &lt; 10 ng/mL were randomly divided into a continuous androgen ablation arm (n = 82), and an intermittent ablation arm (n = 80). Patient age ranged from 54 to 79 years. Median PSA was 25.3 ng/mL. Two hundred two patients were staged T3,M0,N0, and 13 staged T4,N0,M0. Mean follow up in the continuous arm was 22.2 months and 23.0 months in the intermittent arm.</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-de-Leval-2002" TYPE="STUDY">de Leval 2002</LINK>, 77 patients were prospectively enrolled in the trial. Sixty-eight evaluable patients were randomised, 33 to a continuous arm and 35 to an intermittent arm. Inclusion criteria were &lt; 80 years of age and having advanced prostate cancer. Patients with advanced prostate cancer included those with: 1) locally advanced (T3, T4); or 2) metastatic tumours (N+,M+), or both; or 3) relapsing prostate cancer following radical retropubic prostatectomy for clinically localised prostate cancer (T1/T2,N0,M0; 1997 tumour, node, metastases (TNM) staging system). Mean pretreatment serum PSA in ng/mL CAD treated patients 33.7, median 24; Mean pretreatment serum PSA in ng/mL IAS treated patients 43.1, median 21. Mean age of all patients 70.8, median 71.7. Mean follow up was 30.8 months. </P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Calais-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Calais 2002</LINK>, of 765 patients registered, 626 were randomised to an intermittent arm (n = 314) and a continuous arm (n=312). At randomisation 23.7% had a PSA in excess of 4 ng/mL, and the other 76.3% had a PSA &lt; 4. Inclusion criteria included patients with a previously untreated, histological proven prostate cancer (T3-T4,M0,M1), a World Health Organisation (WHO) score of 0 - 2, and aged &lt; 85. Median follow up was 48 months. The mean/median age was not reported.</P>

<B>Types of interventions</B>
<BR/>In <LINK REF="STD-Hering-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Hering 2000</LINK>, patients were randomly divided into the following two groups: In Group A, 18 patients were randomised to a continuous androgen suppression arm; and in Group B, 25 patients were randomised to an intermittent androgen suppression arm. Both groups received 200 mg/day of cyproterone acetate. In the IAS group the cycle was suspended after reaching the PSA nadir, and was restarted when the PSA reached baseline level. In <LINK REF="STD-EAU-TULP-2002" TYPE="STUDY">EAU TULP 2002</LINK>, 282 patients were enrolled, and after 6 months those who made it through maximal blockade and had a normal PSA of &lt; 4 ng/mL (N = 193) were randomised to either intermittent (N = 97) or continuous androgen suppression (N = 96). For patients in the intermittent arm, therapy was re-started when the PSA rose above 20 ng/mL and N0-3M1, or 10 ng/mL and N1-3,M0, or until the PSA returned to below 4 ng/mL. If the PSA persisted at high levels, or if there was clinical progression, androgen suppression remained continuous. In <LINK REF="STD-Yamanaka-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Yamanaka 2005</LINK>, patients were registered as primary candidates of the study and were treated with 2 weeks of steroidal antiandrogen (chlormadinone acetate, CMA). They then were treated with both LHRH agonist (leuprorelin or goserelin) and another 2 weeks of antiandrogen. Thereafter they were treated with LHRH agonist alone. After 6 months of endocrine treatment with LHRH agonist, only patients with PSA levels lower than 10 ng/mL, with a PSA lower than at baseline, and without clinically apparent metastatic disease, were enrolled in the following protocol as final candidates. After this phase, and when registration was done, the patients were randomly divided into two groups according to institutions, age (younger than 70, 70 years or older), PSA levels after 6 months of endocrine treatment, and Gleason score (7 or less, 8 - 10) as follows: continuous androgen ablation group (arm 1) and intermittent androgen ablation group (arm 2) (hormonal therapy must be stopped 6 months after the day of final EBRT treatment). All of these patients were treated with EBRT immediately after completing second-line registration. In <LINK REF="STD-de-Leval-2002" TYPE="STUDY">de Leval 2002</LINK>, all patients fulfilling the inclusion criteria were initially treated with flutamide (3 times 250 mg, daily) for 15 days in order to avoid flare reactions. This therapy was followed by complete androgen blockade therapy using the combination of flutamide (3 times 250 mg, daily) and goserelin acetate (3.6 mg, monthly) for a minimum of 3 months and a maximum of 6 months. Two successive determinations of decreasing serum PSA levels &#8804; 4 ng/mL following a maximum of 6 months of complete androgen suppression, defining hormone-naive prostate cancer, were required for further inclusion of the patients in the randomization procedure. Patients with hormone-naive prostate cancer were then assigned to the CAS or to the IAS therapy regimen. Patients treated with CAD received flutamide (250 mg orally every 8 hours) and goserelin acetate (3.6 mg subcutaneously, monthly) without interruption and were monitored every 2 or 3 months with serum PSA measurements. Patients in the IAS group had their complete androgen deprivation therapy discontinued after the induction-therapy phase and entered the off-treatment phase of the first IAS cycle. They were advised to restart complete androgen blockade if serum PSA levels reached &#8805; 10 ng/mL during the off phase. In <LINK REF="STD-Calais-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Calais 2002</LINK>, all patients were treated with CPA 200 mg for 2 weeks and then a monthly depot injection of LHRA analogue (decapeptyl) plus 200 mg of CPA daily. After 3 months of therapy, if PSA was below 4 or 80% below the initial value, patients were randomised to intermittent MAB or continuous MAB treatment.<BR/>
<B>Types of outcome measures<BR/>
</B>None of the studies addressed overall survival, disease-specific mortality, or quality of life.</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Hering-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Hering 2000</LINK> the outcomes of interest were side effects, in particular impotence, period of response to treatment (the period that patients became hormone resistance), the interval to clinical progression, and change in PSA. In <LINK REF="STD-EAU-TULP-2002" TYPE="STUDY">EAU TULP 2002</LINK> the primary outcome was time to clinical tumor progression or PSA escape (defined as PSA concentrations over 50 ng/mL), or both. Secondary outcomes of interest were of quality of life, survival, safety, serum PSA, and testosterone and alkaline phosphatase levels over the course of the study. In <LINK REF="STD-Yamanaka-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Yamanaka 2005</LINK> the primary endpoint was biochemical (PSA) relapse-free survival, and the secondary endpoints were overall survival, cause-specific survival, longitudinal QOL assessment, and cost effectiveness between the continuous and intermittent arms. In <LINK REF="STD-de-Leval-2002" TYPE="STUDY">de Leval 2002</LINK> the outcomes of interest were morbidity and side effects. In <LINK REF="STD-Calais-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Calais 2002</LINK> outcomes were side effects, quality of life, sexual activity, progression and survival.<U>

<BR/>In <LINK REF="STD-Hering-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Hering 2000</LINK>, in the continuous hormonal therapy group, 61.1% completed the study. Of the 38.9% (7/11) who dropped out, there were two deaths. In the intermittent hormonal treatment group 72% of the patients reached the third treatment cycle. Of the 28% (7/25) of the patients who dropped out, there were two deaths. No patients in the IAS arm who became hormone refractory crossed over to the continuous arm.<BR/> <BR/>In <LINK REF="STD-EAU-TULP-2002" TYPE="STUDY">EAU TULP 2002</LINK>, 282 patients were initially enrolled in the study. After 6 months patients who had received maximal androgen blockade and a normalisation of PSA (&lt; 4 ng/mL) [normalization is typically &lt;0.1 ng/mL] were randomised to an intermittent arm (n = 97) and a continuous arm (n = 96). In the continuous arm a total of 50 patients withdrew from treatment. In the intermittent arm 57.7% had a first restart of therapy on average 17 months after enrollment.

<P>
<BR/>None of the studies addressed the most relevant outcomes with regards to the effectiveness - overall and disease-specific mortality, as well as quality of life.</P>
<P>The majority of studies that were identified from databases and were potential studies for inclusion only had outcomes for intermittent androgen suppression, and were included in 'Characteristics of excluded studies' (<LINK REF="STD-Bouchot-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Bouchot 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Crook-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Crook 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-De-La-Taille-2003" TYPE="STUDY">De La Taille 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Goldenberg-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Goldenberg 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Goldenberg-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Goldenberg 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Grossfeld-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Grossfeld 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gulley-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Gulley 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Higano-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Higano 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Horwich-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Horwich 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hussain-2006-_x0028_SWOG_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Hussain 2006 (SWOG)</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Klotz-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Klotz 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Klotz-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Klotz 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Klotz-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Klotz 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kurek-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Kurek 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lane-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Lane 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mottet-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Mottet 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Oliver-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Oliver 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sato-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Sato 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sciarra-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Sciarra 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Strum-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Strum 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Theyer-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Theyer 1998</LINK>). A few prospective trials were randomised into continuous or intermittent hormonal suppression (<LINK REF="STD-Calais-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Calais 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-de-Leval-2002" TYPE="STUDY">de Leval 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-EAU-TULP-2002" TYPE="STUDY">EAU TULP 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hering-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Hering 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yamanaka-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Yamanaka 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>The apparent clinical and methodological diversity found in the included studies made it difficult to combine into a meta-analysis. Also, the majority of studies did not provide results of both interventions. The results can't be pooled because the outcomes are not homogenous (<LINK REF="STD-Yamanaka-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Yamanaka 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Calais-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Calais 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-de-Leval-2002" TYPE="STUDY">de Leval 2002</LINK>, most patients reported slight to moderate adverse events typically associated with androgen suppression, including hot flushes, loss of libido, and erectile dysfunction. Nevertheless, these side effects resolved in the majority of IAS-treated patients on discontinuation of medication. In <LINK REF="STD-Calais-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Calais 2002</LINK> side effects were minor, with the most common being hot flushes (8.6%). Overall, quality-of-life scores were the same in the two arms of the study at successive follow ups. At the time of registration half of all men were sexually active the previous month. At 15 months follow up sexual activity in men in the intermittent arm was 40% compared to 25% in the continuous arm.</P>

<B>Intermittent versus continuous androgen suppression (both groups received 200 mg/day of cyproterone acetate)</B>
<BR/>In comparing minor side effects (gastrointestinal, gynecomastia and asthenia), <LINK REF="STD-Hering-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Hering 2000</LINK> reported no statistically significant difference (RR 0.29, 95% CI 0.06 to 1.32, P = 0.11) between the two arms. Likewise, in comparing major side effects (gastritis with intensive vomiting and inferior member edema), Hering also found no statistically significant difference between groups (RR 0.36, 95% CI 0.04 to 3.67, P = 0.39). Both are likely due to small sample size. In comparing impotence rates, the study did find a significant difference between the two, favouring the intermittent arm (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.56 to 0.92, P = 0.008). End-of-study impotence rates, however, were not significant (RR 2.19, 95% CI 0.09 to 50.93, P = 0.62).</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>The methodological quality, independent dual data extraction and a systematic search in all relevant health electronic databases are strong features of the present study. This systematic review offers up-to-date but limited evidence supported by only five randomised controlled trials of the effects of intermittent versus continuous androgen suppression for treating prostatic cancer. The majority of the included trials did not address common outcomes, and for this reason a meta-analysis became more difficult, even with a reasonable number of included studies.</P>
<P>Five studies involving 1382 patients were included in this review. All the included studies involved advanced prostate cancer. No study was of adequate size and duration. Few events were reported and they did not assess disease-specific survival or metastatic disease. Only one study evaluated biochemical outcomes. Studies primarily reported adverse events.</P>
<P>There are four randomised studies ongoing (<LINK REF="STD-Takeda-EC-210" TYPE="STUDY">Takeda EC 210</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-NCIC-CTG-_x0028_PR_x002d_7_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">NCIC CTG (PR-7)</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-SWOG-9346" TYPE="STUDY">SWOG 9346</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tunn-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Tunn 1996</LINK>), of which two are devoted to M1b patients (<LINK REF="STD-SWOG-9346" TYPE="STUDY">SWOG 9346</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Takeda-EC-210" TYPE="STUDY">Takeda EC 210</LINK>). The cycle of periods with and without androgen withdrawal should slow down tumor progression and improve quality of life. Men with biochemical failures may benefit more from this approach.</P>
<P>The symptoms caused by androgen deprivation suppression (IDS) vary among patients. The side effects of ADT diminish or even disappear during off-treatment periods. This translates into a potentially significant improvement in quality of life when compared with continuous androgen deprivation therapy.</P>
<P>Further properly well-designed research is necessary, including long-term follow up. These efforts should converge and disseminate to institutions for a more efficient strategy of costs and benefits. There is an urgent need for validated, quality-of-life questionnaires by international research groups so that the results are comparable among them.</P>
<P>The currently available information for IAS versus CAS for men with prostate cancer is limited by a paucity of trials, few patients enrolled, relatively short duration of follow up, and lack of data on mortality and clinical disease progression.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>In light of currently available information on impotence, IAS may have slightly fewer outcomes for side effects than CAS and has lower treatment costs. However, the important outcomes of mortality, disease progression and quality of life are not known. We will have to wait for the results of ongoing randomised trials to see whether IAS or CAS is more effective for the treatment of prostate cancer. Based on our results with little data, more studies are needed.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Current ongoing randomised trials will probably provide definitive information regarding intermittent androgen suppression over the next few years. Until further studies have been completed, the therapeutic concept of IAS should be treated as experimental. Only further randomised controlled trials will be able to establish whether survival and quality of life for patients with prostate cancer can be improved using intermittent androgen suppression.</P>
<P>This systematic review also suggests data for a new project for future randomised, controlled trials in the comparison of intermittent versus continuous androgen suppression for the treatment of prostate cancer. It would be extremely helpful if outcome measures were standardised, such as survival, disease-specific mortality, response to treatment (considering the interval for clinical progression and increase in PSA), clinical progression (such as metastatic disease and biochemical progression), testosterone levels, quality of life (measured by scales such as EORTC QLQ-C30 and EORTC QLQ PR24), side effects, dropouts, and losses to follow up. It would be helpful as well if there were outcome data for subgroup analysis, including age, race, Gleason score (&lt; 7 versus &#8805; 7) nadir PSA, and previous treatment.</P>

<CHAR_METHODS>
<P>Design: an open-label, phase III randomized, controlled trial. Multicenter. Period: Between October 1995 and May 2000. Setting: The University Hospital and 2 community hospitals in Liège, Belgium. Sample size: since the proportion of patients with differents stages of diasease at enrollment was not predictable, it was anticipated that sample size calculations, based on the primary efficacy variable, androgen-independent progression, would be only approximate. Since their initial experience in the thial showed that a substantial number of eligible patients denied the offer of IAD, and since it was anticipated that patient recruitment by 3 centers involved in the trial would be insufficient, it was decided that as many patients as possible would be entered in the study. Generation of allocation: not described. Allocation concealment: not described. Blinded assessment of outcomes: not used. Withdrawals: described (2 patients were completely lost to follow-up. 3 patients suffered from immediate severe adverse events attributed to flutamide treatment, which was interrupted. 4 patientes did not achieve serum PSA levels at the end of induction therapy. Intention-to-treat analysis: not described. Follow-up: mean follow-up period was 30.8 months.</P>
</CHAR_METHODS>
<CHAR_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>77 patients were prospectively enrolled in the trial. Inclusion criteria: patients&lt; 80 years of age and having advanced prostate cancer. Advanced prostate cancer lesions were defined as locally advanced (stage T3 or T4), and/or metastatic (N+ and/or M+) tumors, or relapsing prostate cancer following radical retropubic prostatectomy for clinically localized PCa (classified as stage T1/T2 N0 M0, according to the 1997 TNM staging system). For patients with relapsing prostate cancer, a postoperative serum PSA level &gt; 4 ng/mL was required for their eligibility to the trial. Exclesion criteria: untreated clinically localized prostate cancer (stage T1/T2 N0 M0), other concomitant cancer (with the exception of skin cancers, melanoma excluded), psychiatric or senile disorders, prior hormonal therapy and/or chemotherapy, or severe associated illness. Stratification of patients: before randomization, patients were stratified for age, biopsy Gleason score and baseline serum level. Mean age of the patients at treatment initiation was 70.8 years and mean pretreatment serum PSA was 38.5 ng/mL.</P>
</CHAR_PARTICIPANTS>
<CHAR_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>All patients fulfilling the inclusion criteria were initially treated with flutamide (3 times 250 mg, daily) for 15 days in order to avoid flare reactions. This therapy was followed by complete androgen blockade therapy using the combination of flutamide (3 times 250 mg, daily) and goserelin acetate (3.6 mg, monthly) for a minimum of 3 months and a maximum of 6 months. Two successive determinations of decreasing serum PSA levels less or equaly than 4 ng/mL following a maximum of 6 months of complete androgen suppression, defining hormone-naive prostate cancer, were required for further inclusion of the patients in the randomization procedure. Patients with hormone-naive prostate cancer were then assigned to the CAD or to the IAD therapy regimen. Patients treated with CAD received flutamide (250 mg orally every 8 hours) and goserelin acetate (3.6 mg subcutaneously monthly) without interruption and were monitored every 2 or 3 months with serum PSA measurements. Patients in the IAD group had their complete androgen deprivation therapy discontinued after the induction therapy phase and entered the off-treatement phase of the first IAD cycle. They were advised to restart complete androgen blockade if serum PSA levels reached above or equaly 10 ng/mL, during the off phase.</P>

<CHAR_METHODS>
<P>Design: Randomized controlled trial. Multicentre. Period: Between 2001 and 2003. Sample Size: Considering that the cumulative PSA recurrence rate within 5 years in treatment with endocrine monotherapy for locally advanced prostate cancer in Japanese was demonstrated at about 40%, and that in combination therapy with EBRT and endocrine therapy was demonstrated between 15 and 64%, the cumulative PSA recurrence rate within 5 years in men treated with 3 years of adjuvant endocrine therapy and EBRT, in this study, was assumed to be 30%. For non-recessive verification using hazard ratio of 1.5 as an upper limit, 75 events are necessary in each group in order to have 80% statistical power on the basis of the alternative hypothesis, in wich there is no difference in the disease-free survival rate between both groups. Generation of allocation: not reported. Allocation concealment: not reported. Blinded assessment of outcomes: not described. Withdrawals: reported (215 patients were registered in the protocol. 188 patients were still in the protocol and 27 patients had withdrawn from the protocol. Of 27 cases excluded from the protocol, 3 cases had adverse effects, 6 cases withdrew their agreement to the protocol, 1 case had other lifethreatening cancer during the protocol treatment, 4 cases had recurrence of disease, 12 cases did not meet the criteria at the 2nd registration, and 1 case was excluded from the protocol by a contravention issue. After 14 months patients were treated with continuous or intermittent therapy, in this phase 3 cases withdrawal the continuous group and 5 cases withdrawal the intermittent group).

<CHAR_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>162 patients were acceptable (82 to continuous group and 80 to intermittent group). After 14 months: 48 patients on the continuous group and 41 patients on the intermittent group. Date from patients that were enrolled in the study: aged ranged from 54 to 79 years; the median PSA level at entry was 25.3 ng/mL; the clinical stage was T3M0N0 in 202 and T4N0M0 in 13 patients. Inclusion criteria: biopsy-proven untreated adenocarcinoma of the prostate with clinical stage T3N0M0 or T4N0M0 and were younger than 80 years-old. Exclusion criteria: patients who were treated with antiandrogen or any adrenocortical steroid hormones, or had undergone subcapsular prostatectomy or transurethral resection of the prostate including laser ablation for benign prostatic hyperplasia.</P>
</CHAR_PARTICIPANTS>
<CHAR_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>Patients were registered as primary candidates of the study and were treated with 2 weeks of steroidal antiandrogen (chlormadinone acetate; CMA), then with both luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonist (leuprorelin or goserelin) and another 2 weeks of antiandrogen, and thereafter with LHRH agonist alone. After 6 months of endocrine treatment with LHRH agonist, only patients with PSA levels lower than 10 ng/mL, with a PSA level lower than the pretreatment level and without clically apparent metastatic disease were enrolled in the following protocol as final candidates (2nd-line registration). After this phase, registration was done, the patients were randomly divided into two groups according to institutions, age (younger than 70, 70 years, or older), PSA levels after 6 months of endocrine treatment, and Gleason score (7 or less, 8-10) as follows: continuous androgen ablation group (arm 1) and intermittent androgen ablation group (arm 2) (hormonal therapy must be stopped 6 months after the day of final EBRT treatment). All of these patients were treated with EBRT immediately after completing 2nd-line registration.</P>
