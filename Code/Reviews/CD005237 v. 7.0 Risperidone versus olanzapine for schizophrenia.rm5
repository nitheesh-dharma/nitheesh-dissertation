<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Schizophrenia is a debilitating mental illness that affects about one percent of the population worldwide.<BR/>People who suffer from schizophrenia can sometimes experience a relapse of their illness and may require admission to hospital. Incidences of relapse can be exacerbated due to poor compliance with medication; often a consequence of the adverse effects associated with antipsychotic drugs.</P>
<P>Risperidone and olanzapine are among a class of antipsychotic drugs commonly referred to as atypical antipsychotics or new generation drugs. We systematically reviewed the effects of risperidone in comparison to olanzapine for people with schizophrenia and schizophrenia-like illnesses. We were able to include 16 studies. Both drugs appear to have favourable effects in terms of improvement of symptoms. Both these drugs are also associated with adverse effects. Risperidone is commonly associated with movement disorders and sexual dysfunction and olanzapine with considerable weight gain.</P>

</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Antipsychotic medication is a mainstay of treatment for schizophrenia. Risperidone and olanzapine are popular choices among the new generation drugs.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To determine the clinical effects, safety and cost effectiveness of risperidone compared with olanzapine for treating schizophrenia.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Register (Sept 2005) which is based on regular searches of, amongst others, BIOSIS, CENTRAL, CINAHL, EMBASE, MEDLINE and PsycINFO. References of all identified studies were inspected for further trials. We also contacted relevant pharmaceutical companies for additional information.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>We included all clinical randomised trials comparing risperidone with olanzapine for schizophrenia and schizophrenia-like psychoses.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>We extracted data independently. For homogenous dichotomous data we calculated random effects, relative risk (RR), 95% confidence intervals (CI) and, where appropriate, numbers needed to treat/harm (NNT/H) on an intention-to-treat basis. For continuous data, we calculated weighted mean differences (WMD).</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>We found no difference for the outcome of unchanged or worse in the short term (n=548, 2 RCTs, RR 1.00 CI 0.88 to 1.15). One study favoured olanzapine for the outcome of relapse/rehospitalisation by 12 months (n=279, 1 RCT, RR 2.16 CI 1.31 to 3.54, NNH 7 CI 3 to 25). Most mental state data showed the two drugs to be as effective as each other (n=552, 2 RCTs, RR 'no &lt;20% decrease PANSS by eight weeks' 1.01 CI 0.87 to 1.16). Both drugs commonly cause adverse events: 75% given either drug experience an adverse event; 20% anticholinergic symptoms; both groups experienced insomnia although it was more frequent with risperidone (n=1588, 5 RCTs, RR 1.41 CI 1.15 to 1.72, NNH 15 CI 9 to 41); about 30% experienced sleepiness (n=1713, 6 RCTs, RR 0.92 CI 0.79 to 1.07). People given either drug often experienced some extrapyramidal symptoms (n=893, 3 RCTs, RR 1.18 CI 0.75 to 1.88); 25% of people using risperidone required medication to alleviate these symptoms (n=419, 2 RCTs, RR 1.76 CI 1.25 to 2.48, NNH 8 CI 4 to 25). People allocated to risperidone were less likely to gain weight compared with those given olanzapine and the weight gain was often considerable and of quick onset (n=984, 2 RCTs, RR gain more than 7% of their baseline weight in short term 0.47 CI 0.36 to 0.61, NNH 7 CI 6 to 10). Risperidone participants were less likely to leave the study due to metabolic side effects and weight gain compared with olanzapine (n=667, 1RCT, RR 0.19 CI 0.08 to 0.45). Patients on risperidone were more likely to experience abnormal ejaculation (n=370, 2 RCTs, RR 4.36 CI 1.38 to 13.76, NNH 20 CI 6 to 176). Both drugs are associated with high attrition rates; in the long term consistent findings show that 66% of those allocated risperidone left the study early compared with 56% given olanzapine (n=1440, 5 RCTs, RR 1.17 CI 1.08 to 1.27, NNH 11 CI 7 to 23).</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>We know very little of the effects of these drugs regarding service outcomes, general functioning and behaviours, engagement with services and treatment satisfaction from evaluative studies. There was generally a high rate of attrition in the trials and there appears to be little to differentiate between risperidone and olanzapine except on issues of adverse effects. Both drugs are associated with a reduction in psychotic symptoms but both commonly cause unpleasant adverse effects.</P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>

<BACKGROUND>
<P>Schizophrenia is a debilitating mental illness that afflicts about one percent of the population (<LINK REF="REF-Jablensky-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jablensky 1992</LINK>). Antipsychotic medication is the mainstay of treatment for this condition and there is a trend towards greater use of newer antipsychotics, especially risperidone and olanzapine. The recent guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2002</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-APA-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">APA 2004</LINK>) on treatment of schizophrenia also encourage the use of atypical antipsychotic medications. Recent reports have shown that olanzapine and risperidone account for nearly half of all the antipsychotics prescribed and more than 90% of the atypical antipsychotics prescribed in the UK (<LINK REF="REF-Ren-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ren 2002</LINK>). This increasing use of these two antipsychotics is likely to be mirrored in low and middle income countries, where approximately 80% of people suffering from schizophrenia reside (<LINK REF="REF-Apiquian-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Apiquian 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>Atypical antipsychotics are currently being heavily marketed by industry on the basis of their purported advantage in terms of efficacy and adverse effect profile. Although risperidone and olanzapine are approximately 10 times more expensive than conventional antipsychotics, researchers suggest that if they reduce a person's need for inpatient services, then their use could result in an overall net reduction in costs (<LINK REF="REF-Buckley-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Buckley 1997</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Glazer-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glazer 1997</LINK>). </P>
<P>As the most widely prescribed atypical antipsychotics for schizophrenia, there is an urgent need to critically examine all available evidence and compare risperidone and olanzapine. This is one of a series of reviews focusing on the effects of the newer generation of antipsychotic drugs (<LINK REF="REF-Bagnall-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bagnall 2000</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Duggan-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Duggan 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-El_x002d_Sayeh-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">El-Sayeh 2006</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Fenton-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fenton 2000</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Hunter-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hunter 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Mota-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mota 2002</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Srisurapanont-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Srisurapanont 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>Technical background<BR/>Olanzapine, a thienobenzodiazepine derivative, is an 'atypical' antipsychotic showing affinity at D1- D5, seretonergic (5HT2, 3, 6), muscarinic (subtypes 1- 5), adrenergic (alpha 1- 2) and histaminergic (H1) binding sites (<LINK REF="REF-Conley-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Conley 1998</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Tollefson-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tollefson 1997</LINK>). It is structurally similar to clozapine but has a slightly different binding site affinity. It is weaker than clozapine as an alpha-1 and alpha-2 adrenergic agonist relative to D2, D4 or 5HT2a antagonism.</P>
<P>Risperidone is a benzisoxazole derivative. It blocks dopamine 2 receptors and 5HT2 receptors (with a high ratio of serotonin to D2 receptor blockade). It also blocks alpha1 and alpha2 adrenoceptors, H1 receptors, and has no effect on beta adrenoceptors, muscarinic cholinoceptors or peptidergic receptors (<LINK REF="REF-Janssen-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Janssen 1988</LINK>).</P>

<P>We included all randomised controlled trials.

</OTHER_SEARCHES>
</SEARCH_METHODS>
<DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>[For definitions of terms used in this, and other sections, please refer to the Glossary] </P>
<P>1. Selection of trials<BR/>Material downloaded from electronic sources included details of author, institution or journal of publication. The principal reviewer (MJ) inspected all reports. PH then re-inspected these in order to ensure reliable selection. We resolved any disagreement by discussion and, where there was still doubt, we obtained the full article for further inspection. Once we had acquired the full articles we both decided whether the studies met the review criteria. If disagreement could not be resolved by discussion, we sought further information and, in the interim, added these trials to the list of those awaiting assessment.</P>
<P>2. Assessment of methodological quality <BR/>We assessed the methodological quality of the trials included in this review using the criteria described in the Cochrane Handbook (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2005</LINK>) and the Jadad Scale (<LINK REF="REF-Jadad-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jadad 1996</LINK>). The former is based on the evidence of a strong relationship between allocation concealment and direction of effect (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>). The categories are defined below: </P>
<P>A. Low risk of bias (adequate allocation concealment)<BR/>B. Moderate risk of bias (some doubt about the results) <BR/>C. High risk of bias (inadequate allocation concealment). For the purpose of the analysis in this review, trials were included if they met the Cochrane Handbook criteria A or B. </P>
<P>The Jadad Scale measures a wider range of factors that impact on the quality of a trial. The scales include three items:<BR/>1. Was the study described as randomised?<BR/>2. Was the study described as double-blind? <BR/>3. Was there a description of withdrawals and drop outs?</P>
<P>Each item receives one point if the answer is positive. In addition, a point can be deducted if either the randomisation or the blinding/masking procedures described are inadequate. For this review we used a cut-off of two points on the Jadad scale to check the assessment made by The Cochrane Handbook criteria. However, we did not use the Jadad Scale to exclude trials.</P>
<P>3. Data collection <BR/>MJ and PH independently inspected the citations, selected the trials for inclusion and extracted data from those selected. When disputes arose we attempted resolution by discussion. When this was not possible and further information was necessary to resolve the dilemma, we did not enter the data and added the trial to the list of those awaiting assessment.</P>
<P>4. Data synthesis <BR/>4.1 Data types<BR/>Outcomes were assessed using continuous (for example changes on a behaviour scale), categorical (for example, one of three categories on a behaviour scale, such as 'little change', 'moderate change' or 'much change') or dichotomous (for example, either 'no important changes' or 'important changes' in a person's behaviour) measures. Currently RevMan does not easily support categorical data so they could not be analysed as such.</P>
<P>4.2 Incomplete data <BR/>We did not include trial outcomes if more than 50% of people were not accounted for in the final analysis. This included where the last observation of half or more of the trial participants had been carried over to the end point, assuming that these people had remained stable since leaving the study as we felt this to rely too much on pure assumption. </P>
<P>4.3 Dichotomous - yes/no - data <BR/>We carried out an intention to treat analysis. On the condition that more than 50% of people completed the study, we counted everyone allocated to the intervention regardless of whether they completed the follow. We assumed that those who dropped out had the negative outcome, with the exception of death. Where possible, we attempted to convert outcome measures to dichotomous data. This can be done by identifying cut off points on rating scales and dividing participants accordingly into 'clinically improved' or 'not clinically improved'. If the authors of a study had used a predefined cut off point for determining clinical effectiveness we used this where appropriate. Otherwise we generally assumed that if there had been a 50% reduction in a scale-derived score, this could be considered as a clinically significant response. Similarly, we considered a rating of 'at least much improved' according to the Clinical Global Impression Scale (<LINK REF="REF-Guy-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guy 1976</LINK>) as a clinically significant response.</P>
<P>We calculated the relative risk (RR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI) based on the random effects model, as this takes into account any differences between studies even if there is no statistically significant heterogeneity. It has been shown (<LINK REF="REF-Boissel-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boissel 1999</LINK>) that RR is more intuitive than odds ratios and <LINK REF="REF-Deeks-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deeks 2000</LINK> found that the latter tend to be interpreted as RR by clinicians. This misinterpretation then leads to an overestimate of the impression of the effect. We inspected data to see if an analysis using a fixed effects model made any substantive difference in outcomes that were not statistically significantly heterogeneous. We calculated the number needed to treat (NNT) and the number-needed-to-harm (NNH) as the inverse of the risk difference when the overall results were statistically significant.</P>
<P>4.4 Continuous data <BR/>4.4.1 Normally distributed data: continuous data on clinical and social outcomes are often not normally distributed. We applied the following standards to all data before inclusion to avoid the pitfall of applying parametric tests to non-parametric data: (a) standard deviations and means were reported in the paper or were obtainable from the authors; (b) when a scale started from the finite number zero, the standard deviation, when multiplied by two, was less than the mean (as otherwise the mean is unlikely to be an appropriate measure of the centre of the distribution, (<LINK REF="REF-Altman-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Altman 1996</LINK>); (c) if a scale started from a positive value (such as PANSS which can have values from 30 to 210) the calculation described above was modified to take the scale starting point into account. In these cases skew is present if 2SD&gt;(S-Smin), where S is the mean score and Smin is the minimum score. Endpoint scores on scales often have a finite start and end point and these rules can be applied to them. When continuous data are presented on a scale which includes a possibility of negative values (such as change on a scale), it is difficult to tell whether data are non-normally distributed (skewed) or not. Skewed data from studies of less than 200 participants would have been entered in additional tables rather than into an analysis. Skewed data poses less of a problem when looking at means if the sample size is large and would have been entered into a synthesis.</P>
<P>For change data (endpoint minus baseline), the situation is even more problematic. In the absence of individual patient data it is impossible to know if data are skewed, though this is likely. After consulting the ALLSTAT electronic statistics mailing list, we presented change data in MetaView in order to summarise available information. In doing this, it was assumed either that data were not skewed or that the analyses could cope with the unknown degree of skew. Without individual patient data it is impossible to test this assumption. Where both change and endpoint data were available for the same outcome category, we only presented endpoint data. We acknowledge that by doing this we excluded much of the published change, but argue that endpoint data is more clinically relevant and that if change data were to be presented along with endpoint data, it would be given undeserved equal prominence. Authors of studies reporting only change data are being contacted for endpoint figures. We report clearly non-normally distributed data in the 'other data types' tables. These skewed data are problematic to analyse and present, but not in any way 'bad' data. It is just that statistical methods for meta-analysis of continuous data are based on the premise that data are essentially normally distributed.</P>
<P>4.4.2 Rating scales: A wide range of instruments is available to measure mental health outcomes. These instruments vary in quality and in many cases their validity is uncertain. As the use of rating scales which have not been described in peer-reviewed journals (<LINK REF="REF-Marshall-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marshall 2000</LINK>) is associated with bias, the results of such scales were excluded. Furthermore, we stipulated that the instrument should either be a self report or be completed by a relative or an independent rater (not the therapist), and that the instrument could be considered a global assessment of an area of functioning. </P>
<P>Whenever possible we took the opportunity to make direct comparisons between trials that used the same measurement instrument to quantify specific outcomes. Where continuous data were presented from different scales rating the same effect, we report both sets of data and comment on the general direction of effect.</P>
<P>4.4.3 Summary statistic<BR/>For continuous outcomes we estimated a weighted mean difference (WMD) between groups, again based on the random effects model, as this takes into account any differences between studies even if there is no statistically significant heterogeneity. </P>
<P>4.5 Cluster trials<BR/>Studies increasingly employ 'cluster randomisation' (such as randomisation by clinician or practice) but analysis and pooling of clustered data poses problems. Firstly, authors often fail to account for intra class correlation in clustered studies, leading to a 'unit of analysis' error (<LINK REF="REF-Divine-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Divine 1992</LINK>) whereby p values are spuriously low, confidence intervals unduly narrow and statistical significance overestimated. This causes type I errors (<LINK REF="REF-Bland-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bland 1997</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Gulliford-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gulliford 1999</LINK>). </P>
<P>Where clustering was not accounted for in primary studies, we presented the data in a table, with a (*) symbol to indicate the presence of a probable unit of analysis error. In subsequent versions of this review we will seek to contact first authors of studies to obtain intra-class correlation co-efficients of their clustered data and to adjust for these using accepted methods (<LINK REF="REF-Gulliford-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gulliford 1999</LINK>). Where clustering has been incorporated into the analysis of primary studies, we will also present these data as if from a non-cluster randomised study, but adjusted for the clustering effect.</P>
<P>We have sought statistical advice and have been advised that the binary data as presented in a report should be divided by a 'design effect'. This is calculated using the mean number of participants per cluster (m) and the intra class correlation co-efficient (ICC) [Design effect = 1+ (m-1)*ICC] (<LINK REF="REF-Donner-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Donner 2002</LINK>). If the ICC was not reported it was assumed to be 0.1 (<LINK REF="REF-Ukoumunne-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ukoumunne 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>If cluster studies had been appropriately analysed taking into account intra-class correlation coefficients and relevant data documented in the report, synthesis with other studies would have been possible using the generic inverse variance technique.</P>
<P>5. Investigation for heterogeneity<BR/>Firstly, we considered all the included studies within any comparison to judge clinical heterogeneity. We first used visual inspection of graphs to investigate the possibility of statistical heterogeneity. We supplemented this using, primarily, the I-squared statistic. This provides an estimate of the percentage of variability due to heterogeneity rather than chance alone. Where the I-squared estimate was greater than or equal to 75%, we interpreted this as indicating the presence of high levels of heterogeneity (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2003</LINK>). If inconsistency was high, we did not summate data, but presented them separately and investigated reasons for heterogeneity.</P>
<P>6. Addressing publication bias <BR/>We entered data from all identified and selected trials into a funnel graph (trial effect versus trial size) in an attempt to investigate the likelihood of overt publication bias (<LINK REF="REF-Egger-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Egger 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>7. Sensitivity analyses <BR/>We compared results for high doses with those for lower doses with regard to the primary outcome of relapse. We employed the definition of 'high dose' used in the study or, if such a definition was not reported and if data were available, we defined &gt; 8 mg of risperidone/day or &gt; 20 mg of olanzapine/day as high dose.</P>
<P>8. General <BR/>Where possible, we entered data in such a way that the area to the left of the line of no effect indicated a favourable outcome for risperidone.</P>

<RESULTS>
<STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<P>For substantive descriptions of the studies please see Included and Excluded Studies tables.</P>
<P>1. Excluded studies<BR/>We excluded 36 studies from the review, 16 of which had no usable data. We attempted to contact the first authors of these studies but did not manage to acquire further data. Eleven studies were not randomised. One was excluded as it was conducted on healthy human volunteers. Two trials did not directly compare risperidone with olanzapine and one was excluded as the majority of participants were adolescents. We had to exclude one study (<LINK REF="STD-Jerrell-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Jerrell 2002</LINK>) because more than 50% of the participants did not complete the trial and no usable data were obtained. Four trials were simply an analysis of pooled data from other studies and were not trials themselves. </P>
<P>2. Awaiting assessment<BR/>There are 21 studies currently awaiting assessment. All reports are small and contain no usable data. It is impossible to know if some of these represent further reports of already included or excluded studies. Where possible, we contacted relevant sources and are awaiting responses.</P>
<P>3. Ongoing studies<BR/>We have identified four ongoing studies. <LINK REF="STD-Sacchetti-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Sacchetti 2003</LINK> is an ongoing study where participants with a diagnosis of DSM-IV schizophrenia were randomised in a ratio of 2:1:1 for quetiapine: olanzapine: risperidone. They plan to recruit a total of 100 participants and follow them up over 16 weeks. <LINK REF="STD-Meltzer-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Meltzer 2002</LINK> is a one year study comparing the effects of switching from other psychotropic drugs to risperidone and olanzapine on measures of weight, serum lipids and serum glucose. It remains to be seen if there would be any data comparing risperidone directly with olanzapine. Marder 2001is an ongoing study that compares risperidone with olanzapine for people with schizophrenia living in the community. We await further reports from the <LINK REF="STD-CATIE-2005" TYPE="STUDY">CATIE 2005</LINK> study (including cost effectiveness and neurocognitive data) and the results of its second phase (<LINK REF="STD-CATIE-2006" TYPE="STUDY">CATIE 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>4. Included studies<BR/>We identified 16 studies for inclusion. Eleven were described as double blind and one as 'single rater-blind'; the remaining four did not describe blinding. We considered that five studies reported adequately on concealment having reviewed some of the information contained within the Cochrane schizophrenia Group relating to these trials.</P>
<P>4.1 Length of trials<BR/>Schizophrenia is a lifelong condition that affects young people. Seven studies reported data on short-term follow-up (up to 12 weeks) and one on medium term (13 to 26 weeks). Eight trials, involving a total of 1710 people reported data on long-term follow-up (over 26 weeks). Some of the ongoing short and medium term studies may involve longer follow-up. </P>
<P>4.2 Participants<BR/>Three of the 16 included studies had participants with no clearly operationalised diagnostic criteria (<LINK REF="STD-Littrell-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Littrell 1999</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Namjoshi-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Namjoshi 2002</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Ritchie-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ritchie 2003</LINK>). Seven trials included people with a sole diagnosis of schizophrenia (<LINK REF="STD-Casey-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Casey 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-CATIE-2005" TYPE="STUDY">CATIE 2005</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Chan-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Chan 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Littrell-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Littrell 1999</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Namjoshi-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Namjoshi 2002</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Purdon-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Purdon 1998</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Ritchie-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ritchie 2003</LINK>). The remaining nine studies included participants with a diagnosis of schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder or disorders related to schizophrenia. The majority of people in most studies were male. Only two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Jeste-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Jeste 2003</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Ritchie-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ritchie 2003</LINK>) had a greater female to male ratio. The mean age of study participants was late thirties to early forties. </P>
<P>In four trials we could not elicit definitive exclusion criteria (<LINK REF="STD-Conley-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Conley 2001</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Gureje-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Gureje 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Littrell-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Littrell 1999</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Namjoshi-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Namjoshi 2002</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Chan-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Chan 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Jeste-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Jeste 2003</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Purdon-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Purdon 1998</LINK> excluded people with comorbid substance misuse disorder. Five studies excluded people with a history of resistance to the intervention medication used (<LINK REF="STD-Volavka-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Volavka 2002</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-CATIE-2005" TYPE="STUDY">CATIE 2005</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Conley-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Conley 2001</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Jeste-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Jeste 2003</LINK>, Tran 1997 (HGBG)). Similarly <LINK REF="STD-Ritchie-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ritchie 2003</LINK> excluded participants who had been previously treated with either of the intervention medications. <LINK REF="STD-de-Haan-2002" TYPE="STUDY">de Haan 2002</LINK> excluded participants with neurological or endocrine diseases and mental retardation. One study (<LINK REF="STD-CATIE-2005" TYPE="STUDY">CATIE 2005</LINK>) excluded participants with schizoaffective disorder, mental retardation, other cognitive disorder, history of serious adverse treatments to the proposed treatments and having had only one schizophrenic episode.</P>
<P>Severity of illness was not specifically mentioned in the studies. </P>
<P>4.3 Setting<BR/>Six of the 16 studies were described as taking place in hospital or inpatient settings (<LINK REF="STD-Volavka-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Volavka 2002</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Casey-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Casey 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Chan-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Chan 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-de-Haan-2002" TYPE="STUDY">de Haan 2002</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Malyarov-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Malyarov 1999</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Ritchie-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ritchie 2003</LINK>). Six trials took place in both inpatient and out-patient settings (<LINK REF="STD-CATIE-2005" TYPE="STUDY">CATIE 2005</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Conley-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Conley 2001</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Harvey-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Harvey 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Jeste-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Jeste 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Keefe-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Keefe 2005</LINK>, Tran 1997 (HGBG)). <LINK REF="STD-Littrell-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Littrell 1999</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Purdon-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Purdon 1998</LINK> took place exclusively in the outpatient setting and we could not find explicit information on the settings of the remaining two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Gureje-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Gureje 2003</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Namjoshi-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Namjoshi 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>4.4 Study size<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-CATIE-2005" TYPE="STUDY">CATIE 2005</LINK> is currently the largest relevant study with 673 people randomised to receive either risperidone or olanzapine. <LINK REF="STD-Conley-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Conley 2001</LINK> randomised 407 participants <LINK REF="STD-Keefe-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Keefe 2005</LINK> randomised 345 participants. <LINK REF="STD-de-Haan-2002" TYPE="STUDY">de Haan 2002</LINK> randomised 36 participants, <LINK REF="STD-Purdon-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Purdon 1998</LINK> randomised 42 people, <LINK REF="STD-Gureje-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Gureje 2003</LINK> randomised 65 people and <LINK REF="STD-Chan-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Chan 2003</LINK> 60 participants. Other studies included between 108 and 364 participants.</P>
<P>4.5 Interventions<BR/>The trialists administered risperidone in a wide range of doses from 1.5 mg to 10 mg per day. Doses of olanzapine ranged from 5 mg to 30 mg per day. <LINK REF="STD-Volavka-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Volavka 2002</LINK> also involved two arms, haloperidol (5 -20 mg/day) and clozapine (up to 500 mg per day). <LINK REF="STD-Keefe-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Keefe 2005</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Namjoshi-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Namjoshi 2002</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Purdon-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Purdon 1998</LINK>, had a haloperidol (5 -20 mg) group as a comparator. <LINK REF="STD-Ritchie-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ritchie 2003</LINK> used oral or depot fluphenazine or haloperidol. <LINK REF="STD-CATIE-2005" TYPE="STUDY">CATIE 2005</LINK> had other intervention arms involving quetiapine, perphenazine and ziprasidone. Some studies used 'benzodiazepines and anticholinergics "as required" (<LINK REF="STD-Conley-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Conley 2001</LINK>, Tran 1997 (HGBG), <LINK REF="STD-Volavka-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Volavka 2002</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Casey-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Casey 2003</LINK> used divalproex plus risperidone and divalproex plus olanzapine comparator arms. <LINK REF="STD-Keefe-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Keefe 2005</LINK> permitted the use of antidepressants with the exception of fluvoxamine and lithium. Acute use of valproic acid, carbamazepine, antiemetics and steroids was allowed. The use of one benzodiazepine/hypnotic at a time was allowed in <LINK REF="STD-Keefe-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Keefe 2005</LINK>.</P>
<P>4.6 Outcomes<BR/>Global outcomes were reported in several ways in the studies. <LINK REF="STD-Chan-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Chan 2003</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Conley-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Conley 2001</LINK> used CGI scores to measure global clinical improvement in the short term. <LINK REF="STD-Gureje-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Gureje 2003</LINK> and Tran 1997 (HGBG), however, reported average end point scores of the same scale to measure global outcome in the long term. Only <LINK REF="STD-CATIE-2005" TYPE="STUDY">CATIE 2005</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Namjoshi-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Namjoshi 2002</LINK> reported on the important outcome of rehospitalisation.</P>
<P>Several scales were used in the trials to measure mental state. For the purposes of analysis we used PANSS, BPRS, SANS, HRSD and Neuro-cognitive functioning as measures of mental state. We found seven studies reporting data related to one or more of these tools. If possible we used the binary data from these measures, but the validity of dichotomising from these measures, although widely accepted, is nevertheless unclear. </P>
<P>In nine studies usable data on adverse effects is reported (<LINK REF="STD-Volavka-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Volavka 2002</LINK> , <LINK REF="STD-CATIE-2005" TYPE="STUDY">CATIE 2005</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Chan-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Chan 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Conley-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Conley 2001</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Gureje-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Gureje 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Jeste-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Jeste 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Keefe-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Keefe 2005</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Purdon-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Purdon 1998</LINK>, Tran 1997 (HGBG). Although adverse events are an important outcome measure from any trial, the other seven trials did not report any usable data whatsoever.</P>
<P>Six studies reported usable data on weight gain. <LINK REF="STD-CATIE-2005" TYPE="STUDY">CATIE 2005</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Conley-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Conley 2001</LINK> reported weight gain of at least 7%, and this was taken as being clinically significant. We are unsure why the specific percentage is 7% as opposed to 6% or 10%. <LINK REF="STD-Gureje-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Gureje 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Purdon-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Purdon 1998</LINK> and Tran 1997 (HGBG), however, reported the average total body weight. <LINK REF="STD-Keefe-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Keefe 2005</LINK> reported any gain in weight. </P>
<P>Three of the included studies did not provide any usable data on participants leaving the study early. </P>
<P>In both <LINK REF="STD-Gureje-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Gureje 2003</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Tran-1997-_x0028_HGBG_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Tran 1997 (HGBG)</LINK> data on quality of life was recorded and reported. The Quality of Life Scale data were continuous and there was no a priori definition of what constitutes a clinically significant improvement.</P>
<P>4.6.1 Outcome scales: details of the only scales that provided usable data are shown below. Reasons for exclusions of data are given under 'Outcomes' in the 'Included studies' section.</P>
<P>4.6.1.1 Global state - Clinical Global Impression Scale - CGI Scale (<LINK REF="REF-Guy-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guy 1976</LINK>)<BR/>Trialists used this to assess both severity of illness and clinical improvement, by comparing the conditions of the person standardised against other people with the same diagnosis. A seven-point scoring system is usually used with low scores showing decreased severity and/or overall improvement.</P>
<P>4.6.1.2 Mental state scales<BR/>4.6.1.2.1 Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale - BPRS (<LINK REF="REF-Overall-1962" TYPE="REFERENCE">Overall 1962</LINK>)<BR/>This is used to assess the severity of abnormal mental state. The original scale has 16 items, but a revised 18-item scale is commonly used. Each item is defined on a seven-point scale varying from 'not present' to 'extremely severe', scoring from 0-6 or 1-7. Scores can range from 0-126, with high scores indicating more severe symptoms. </P>
<P>4.6.1.2.2 Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression - HDRS (<LINK REF="REF-Hamilton-1960" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hamilton 1960</LINK>) <BR/>This instrument is designed to be used only on patients already diagnosed as suffering from affective disorder of depressive type. It is used for quantifying the results of an interview, and its value depends entirely on the skill of the interviewer in eliciting the necessary information. The scale contains 17 variables measured on either a five or a three-point rating scale, the latter being used where quantification of the variable is either difficult or impossible. Among the variables are: depressed mood, suicide, work and loss of interest, retardation, agitation, gastro-intestinal symptoms, general somatic symptoms, hypochondria, loss of insight, and loss of weight. It is useful to have two raters independently scoring a patient at the same interview. The scores of the patient are obtained by summing the scores of the two physicians. High scores indicate greater severity of depressive symptoms.</P>
<P>4.6.1.2.3 Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale - PANSS (<LINK REF="REF-Kay-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kay 1986</LINK>)<BR/>This schizophrenia scale has 30 items, each of which can be defined on a seven-point scoring system varying from 1 - absent to 7 - extreme. This scale can be divided into three sub-scales for measuring the severity of general psychopathology, positive symptoms (PANSS-P), and negative symptoms (PANSS-N). A lower score indicates lesser severity.</P>
<P>4.6.1.2.4 Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms - SANS (<LINK REF="REF-Andreasen-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Andreasen 1983</LINK>)<BR/>This six-point scale gives a global rating of the following negative symptoms; alogia, affective blunting, avolition-apathy, anhedonia-asociality and attention impairment. Higher scores indicate more symptoms. Only <LINK REF="STD-Tran-1997-_x0028_HGBG_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Tran 1997 (HGBG)</LINK> provided usable data.</P>
<P>4.6.1.3 Adverse effects scales<BR/>4.6.1.3.1 Barnes Akathisia Scale - BAS (<LINK REF="REF-Barnes-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barnes 1989</LINK>)<BR/>The scale comprises items rating the observed, restless movements that characterise akathisia, a subjective awareness of restlessness, and any distress associated with the condition. These items are rated from 0 - normal to 3 - severe. In addition, there is an item for rating global severity (from 0 - absent to 5 - severe). A low score indicates low levels of akathisia.</P>
<P>4.6.1.3.2 Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating Scale - ESRS (<LINK REF="REF-Chouinard-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chouinard 1993</LINK>)<BR/>This consists of a questionnaire relating to parkinsonian symptoms (nine items), a physician's examination for parkinsonism and dyskinetic movements (eight items), and a clinical global impression of tardive dyskinesia. </P>
<P>4.6.1.3.3 Simpson Angus Scale - SAS (<LINK REF="REF-Simpson-1970" TYPE="REFERENCE">Simpson 1970</LINK>)<BR/>This ten-item scale, with a scoring system of 0-4 for each item, measures drug-induced parkinsonism, a short-term drug-induced movement disorder. A low score indicates low levels of parkinsonism.</P>
<P>4.6.1.4 Quality of life - Quality of Life Scale -QLS, (<LINK REF="REF-Carpenter-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carpenter 1994</LINK>)<BR/>This is a semi structured interview conducted and rated by trained clinicians. It contains 21 items rated on a 7-point scale based on the interviewer's judgement of patient functioning. A total QLS and four sub-scale scores are calculated, with higher scores indicating less impairment.</P>
<P>4.6.2 Unusable data<BR/>Much data were collected in studies and reported in ways that made them unusable for the purpose of this review. Outcomes such as death, clearly of interest, were reported in only three studies. Some trialists reported continuous measures of global state (CGI) but no variances are reported. The same applies to their repeated measures of mental state (BPRS, BPRS-PANNS), general functioning (CGI) and adverse effects (Simpson-Angus scale, Barnes Akathisia scale, Abnormal Involuntary Movement scale) and other outcome measures including changes in body weight, serum prolactin, and QTc interval changes. It is possible that there is a systematic bias in the design of studies that ensures that data, such as the simple binary outcome of death, are not well reported. </P>
<P>4.6.3 Missing outcomes<BR/>We found no usable outcomes for the following categories: service outcomes, general functioning and behaviour, engagement with services and satisfaction with treatment. </P>
<P>4.6.4 Primary outcomes<BR/>Only <LINK REF="STD-Namjoshi-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Namjoshi 2002</LINK> (n=279) and <LINK REF="STD-CATIE-2005" TYPE="STUDY">CATIE 2005</LINK> (n=667) reported our pre-stated primary outcome of relapse/re-hospitalization.</P>
</STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<STUDY_QUALITY>
<P>1. Randomisation<BR/>All included studies were said to be randomised. However many of the included studies did not explicitly describe the method by which this was done. <LINK REF="STD-Volavka-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Volavka 2002</LINK> initially had three arms comparing haloperidol, risperidone and clozapine. The olanzapine arm was added later. The study authors recognised the possibility of a bias manifesting as a cohort effect but state that blind conditions were never compromised. <LINK REF="STD-Gureje-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Gureje 2003</LINK> is the only study that stated that those in charge of allocation were blind to the participant list. This trial does state that the randomisation list was not accessible to the study site. <LINK REF="STD-Conley-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Conley 2001</LINK> used stratified randomisation procedure taking into account investigator, body mass index, baseline PANSS total and ESRS scores. It is implied that <LINK REF="STD-Conley-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Conley 2001</LINK> followed appropriate measures to conceal allocation. This however is not explicitly stated in all the reports. This concealment of allocation has repeatedly been shown to be of key importance in excluding selection biases (<LINK REF="REF-J_x00fc_ni-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jni 2001</LINK>). Therefore we assigned some trials to category B (moderate risk of bias - some doubt about the results, see methods section). This was confirmed by poor ratings on the Jadad Scale (see Included Studies table).</P>
<P>2. Blindness<BR/>Eleven studies were described as being double-blind (<LINK REF="STD-Casey-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Casey 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-CATIE-2005" TYPE="STUDY">CATIE 2005</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Conley-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Conley 2001</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Gureje-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Gureje 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Harvey-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Harvey 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Jeste-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Jeste 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Keefe-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Keefe 2005</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Namjoshi-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Namjoshi 2002</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Purdon-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Purdon 1998</LINK>, Tran 1997 (HGBG), <LINK REF="STD-Volavka-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Volavka 2002</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Chan-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Chan 2003</LINK> states that the trial was "single rater blind". <LINK REF="STD-Littrell-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Littrell 1999</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Ritchie-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ritchie 2003</LINK> were described as open label. <LINK REF="STD-Malyarov-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Malyarov 1999</LINK> did not report about blinding. None of the studies reported any test of blinding. If blinding is recognised to be of such importance for minimising observation bias, it could be expected that testing of this blinding would be a priority.</P>
<P>3. Loss to follow up<BR/>Eight of the included studies reported data in terms of a last observation carried forwards (LOCF) analysis and an OC analysis (observed cases, defined as those completing the trial) (<LINK REF="STD-CATIE-2005" TYPE="STUDY">CATIE 2005</LINK> - only for weight, <LINK REF="STD-Chan-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Chan 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Conley-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Conley 2001</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Gureje-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Gureje 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Harvey-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Harvey 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Keefe-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Keefe 2005</LINK>, Tran 1997 (HGBG), <LINK REF="STD-Volavka-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Volavka 2002</LINK>). Although LOCF analyses are commonly used to account for missing observations, this technique could introduce bias as considerable assumptions are made about people who did not stay in the study. <LINK REF="STD-Casey-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Casey 2003</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Ritchie-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ritchie 2003</LINK> have used intention to treat analysis (ITT). Four studies have not clearly described how they have used the data for people who were lost to follow up (<LINK REF="STD-Jeste-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Jeste 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Littrell-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Littrell 1999</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Namjoshi-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Namjoshi 2002</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Purdon-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Purdon 1998</LINK>). We saw no reporting of attempts to validate assumptions by following up people who did drop out early. </P>
<P>In some included studies, dropout rates were more than 50%. Using LOCF, 50% of the data on certain outcomes are assumed. We feel that this is too great an assumption (see Methods 4.2) and have excluded these data. We tried to undertake an intention-to-treat analysis. Where there was no data available for proportions under 50%, we assumed a negative outcome (see Methods 4.2). </P>
<P>The reasons for loss to follow up are reasonably well reported and we have recorded these in the outcomes. </P>
<P>4. Data reporting <BR/>Overall much of the data we found could not be used because of poor reporting. Findings which are presented as graphs, in percentiles or just reported as inexact p-values are often of little use to a reviewer. Many studies failed to provide standard deviations when reporting mean changes. We are seeking further data from the first authors of relevant trials.</P>
</STUDY_QUALITY>
<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
<P>1. The search<BR/>The initial search resulted in over 865 citations. We were only able to include 148 of these that related to 16 studies from which we could extract usable data. We used information obtained from drug companies that was available to the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group regarding trials on risperidone and olanzapine.</P>
<P>2. COMPARISON 1: RISPERIDONE versus OLANZAPINE</P>
<P>2.1 Global effect<BR/>Only <LINK REF="STD-Jeste-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Jeste 2003</LINK> provided data on CGI unchanged or worse and <LINK REF="STD-Conley-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Conley 2001</LINK> on moderate or more severely ill. We found no difference for the outcome of unchanged or worse by the short term (n=548, 2 RCTs, RR 1.00 CI 0.88 to 1.15). Three studies<B> </B>(<LINK REF="STD-Chan-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Chan 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Conley-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Conley 2001</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Jeste-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Jeste 2003</LINK>) reported binary outcomes for "No clinically important response". Again, no clear difference was found in these studies between risperidone and olanzapine (n=612, 3 RCTs, RR 1.07 CI 0.90 to 1.27). </P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Chan-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Chan 2003</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Conley-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Conley 2001</LINK> report data about use of additional benzodiazepines, probably to calm disturbance. We found no significant difference between the risperidone and olanzapine groups (n=437, 2 RCTs, RR 1.83 CI 0.41 to 8.24) although data were heterogeneous (I-squared 85%). </P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-CATIE-2005" TYPE="STUDY">CATIE 2005</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Namjoshi-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Namjoshi 2002</LINK> were the only studies to provide data on the important outcome of relapse/rehospitalisation but for <LINK REF="STD-CATIE-2005" TYPE="STUDY">CATIE 2005</LINK> over half the people originally allocated had left the study and it was not known if those people had subsequent hospitalisations. Because of this high attrition we do not include the <LINK REF="STD-CATIE-2005" TYPE="STUDY">CATIE 2005</LINK> data in this outcome. For the same reason data from the <LINK REF="STD-CATIE-2005" TYPE="STUDY">CATIE 2005</LINK> study on the outcome of ratio of hospitalisations to total person-year of exposure was not used either. By 12 months in the <LINK REF="STD-Namjoshi-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Namjoshi 2002</LINK> study the number of people rehospitalised was lower in the olanzapine group (n=279, 1 RCTs, RR 2.16 CI 1.31 to 3.54, NNH 7 CI 3 to 25).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Gureje-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Gureje 2003</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Tran-1997-_x0028_HGBG_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Tran 1997 (HGBG)</LINK> report average end point, long term CGI scores which indicate the global severity of the illness. There was no difference between the risperidone and olanzapine groups on this measure at more than 26 weeks (n=394, 2 RCTs, WMD -0.08 CI -0.15 to 0.32). <LINK REF="STD-Tran-1997-_x0028_HGBG_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Tran 1997 (HGBG)</LINK> (n=339) also reports data on average CGI scores but these were skewed. The very small differences were not stated to be statistically significant on a parametric test. </P>
<P>2.2 Mental state<BR/>Some studies have used a binary percentage of PANSS improvement as a measure of efficacy. There is no clear difference between risperidone and olanzapine for the outcome of 'no &lt;20% decrease' in the short term (n=552, 2 RCTs, RR 1.00 CI 0.87 to 1.15) or by a longer term follow up (n=339, 1 RCT, RR 0.93 CI 0.71 to 1.21). This null finding applies to when the cut off was &lt;30% both in the short term and in the long term. When the cut off was &lt;40%, in the long term, it seemed to favour olanzapine but just about failed to reach statistical significance (n=339, 1RCT, RR 1.14 CI 0.99 to 1.32). However the results were just reaching statistical significance favouring olanzapine when the cut off was &lt; 50% decrease in PANSS scores in the long term (n=339, 1 RCT, RR 1.11 CI 1.01 to 1.22, NNT 12 CI 6 to 127). </P>
<P>Some studies have reported the average total or average change scores. PANSS endpoint scores do not convincingly favour either compound but the longer term data does show some favour towards olanzapine (n=435, 3 RCTs, WMD 5.8 CI 0.3 to 11.31). BPRS endpoint data are skewed but also tend to favour olanzapine. Change data from both PANSS and BPRS are skewed and presented in tabular form. Several studies report PANSS change in both short and long term but results do not suggest that one drug is clearly more effective than the other. BPRS endpoint data from <LINK REF="STD-Ritchie-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ritchie 2003</LINK> (n=66) are skewed and presented in tabular form. </P>
<P>The PANSS was also used to generate endpoint negative symptom sub scores. Short term data were unconvincing of any difference between risperidone and olanzapine (n=358, 2 RCTs, WMD 0.77 CI -1.62 to 3.15) as were data up to one year (n=42, 1 RCT, MD 0.20 CI -3.36 to 3.76). This also applies to skewed data on the same outcome as measured by SANS in the large <LINK REF="STD-Tran-1997-_x0028_HGBG_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Tran 1997 (HGBG)</LINK> study (n=308). Change scores for negative outcomes were generated in a few studies. All are skewed and the long term data for the PANSS involves over 600 people. It is not advisable to synthesise such data but, nevertheless, differences were very small and there was no clear pattern of difference between the interventions. <LINK REF="STD-Tran-1997-_x0028_HGBG_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Tran 1997 (HGBG)</LINK> also used SANS to rate change in negative outcomes and skewed data are reported in tabular form. </P>
<P>Several studies used PANSS to produce endpoint and change positive symptom sub scores. All data, whether the skewed change scores or endpoint ratings do not show any clear favouring of either drug (n=353, 2 RCTs WMD PANSS endpoint score short term -0.50 CI -1.76 to 0.75).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Conley-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Conley 2001</LINK> (n=376) reports very similar depression scores (Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression, skewed). <LINK REF="STD-Volavka-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Volavka 2002</LINK> (n=52) reports on neurocognitive functioning scores. Data are also skewed but does not suggest any difference between risperidone and olanzapine. </P>
<P>2.3 Adverse events<BR/>2.3.1 Any adverse event<BR/>Almost three quarters of people given either risperidone or olanzapine experienced an adverse event (n=977, 3 RCTs, RR 1.00 CI 0.92 to 1.08).</P>
<P>2.3.2 Cardiovascular system<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Conley-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Conley 2001</LINK> (n=377) reported the outcome of 'any cardiovascular event'. There were three events in the group allocated to olanzapine versus none in people given risperidone (RR 0.14 CI 0.01 to 2.76).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-CATIE-2005" TYPE="STUDY">CATIE 2005</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Tran-1997-_x0028_HGBG_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Tran 1997 (HGBG)</LINK> reported dichotomous data on QTc prolongation. There was no difference between risperidone and olanzapine on this outcome measure (n=686, 2RCTs, RR 3.58 CI 0.44 to 29.29) <LINK REF="STD-Tran-1997-_x0028_HGBG_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Tran 1997 (HGBG)</LINK> reported reported new cases of QTC prolongation (defined by authors as &lt;430 msec at baseline to greater or equal to 430 msec at endpoint). This was done comparing risperidone at a dose of 4 to 12 mg/day versus olanzapine at doses of 10mg, 15 mg and 20 mg per day. These data are skewed and seemed to suggest no difference between the two drugs. <LINK REF="STD-Conley-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Conley 2001</LINK> recorded average change of QTc interval from baseline and had similar findings. </P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Purdon-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Purdon 1998</LINK> (n=42) reported several cardiovascular symptoms including dyspnoea, hypertension, palpitation, tachycardia or other cardiac symptoms. No clear differences between the two drugs were found in this trial. </P>
<P>2.3.3.1 Central nervous system (excluding extra pyramidal symptoms)<BR/>Various studies report anticholinergic symptoms including blurred vision, diplopia, dizziness, postural hypotension and rhinitis. There was no difference between the risperidone and olanzapine groups experiencing any of the above side effects, although rates of dizziness were reasonably high (~11% each group, n=1036, 4 RCTs, RR 1.32 CI 0.84 to 2.07). Interestingly risperidone seemed less likely to cause dry mouth compared to olanzapine (n=736, 3RCTs, RR 0.66 CI 0.44 to 0.99). <LINK REF="STD-CATIE-2005" TYPE="STUDY">CATIE 2005</LINK> reported data on a combination of urinary hesitancy, dry mouth and constipation and found no difference between the risperidone and olanzapine groups. </P>
<P>2.3.3.2 <LINK REF="STD-CATIE-2005" TYPE="STUDY">CATIE 2005</LINK> has reported extrapyramidal side effects using rating scale measurements. These include the AIMS global severity score, Barnes Akathisia Rating scale global score and Simpson-Angus Extrapyramidal Signs Scale mean scores and found no difference between risperidone and olanzapine.</P>
<P>2.3.3.3 Eight studies have reported data on sleep problems. People given risperidone were more likely to experience insomnia compared with those given olanzapine (n=1588, 5 RCTs, RR 1.41 CI 1.15 to 1.72, NNH 15 CI 9 to 41). About 25% of both groups experienced sleep disturbance (n=1458, 4 RCTs, RR 1.57 CI 0.93 to 2.66) and approximately 30% sleepiness (n=1713, 6 RCTs, RR 0.92 CI 0.79 to 1.07). <LINK REF="STD-CATIE-2005" TYPE="STUDY">CATIE 2005</LINK> reported sedation severe enough to cause withdrawal from the study. The trend seemed to favour risperidone although it was not statistically significant (N=663, 1 RCT, RR 0.42 CI 0.11 to 1.63).</P>
<P>2.3.3.4 Central nervous system - other adverse events.<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Purdon-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Purdon 1998</LINK> reported data on amnesia and migraine and found no difference between risperidone and olanzapine. 22% of people given risperidone reported headaches compared to 14% given olanzapine. Headaches were reported by six trials as an adverse event and it was found that risperidone was more likely to cause headaches than olanzapine (n=1101, 6 RCTs, RR 1.48 CI 1.15 to 1.91 NNH 14 CI 8 to 45). </P>
<P>2.3.4 Endocrine system<BR/>Incidences of menstrual disorders were low and women on olanzapine were no more likely to experience amenorrhoea, dysmenorrhoea, galactorrhea, metrorrhagia and other menstrual disorders compared with those on risperidone. Neither sex was more likely to experience gynaecomastia/galactorrhea on either risperidone or olanzapine.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-CATIE-2005" TYPE="STUDY">CATIE 2005</LINK> reported change from baseline in terms of prolactin levels. Data were skewed but risperidone seemed to cause a significant increase on this parameter compared to olanzapine. </P>
<P>2.3.5 Extra pyramidal symptoms<BR/>About 33% of people given either drug experienced some extrapyramidal symptom (n=893, 3 RCTs, RR 1.18 CI 0.75 to 1.88).<BR/> <BR/>About 25% of people using risperidone require medication to alleviate extrapyramidal adverse effects. This is consistently more than those allocated olanzapine and this reaches conventional levels of statistical significance between 12 weeks and 12 months (n=419, 2 RCTs, RR 1.76 CI 1.25 to 2.48, NNH 8 CI 4 to 25). There is no difference between risperidone and olanzapine in terms of participants needing medication to avoid EPS beyond 52 weeks or participants having to leave the study early due to extrapyramidal side effects.</P>
<P>Five trials reported data on numerous specific extrapyramidal symptoms. For the outcome of most movement disorders, there was no difference between people given risperidone and those allocated olanzapine although <LINK REF="STD-Tran-1997-_x0028_HGBG_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Tran 1997 (HGBG)</LINK> reported that people on risperidone were more likely to develop new parkinsonism symptoms compared with those given olanzapine (n=339, 1 RCT, RR 1.73, CI 1.07 to 2.81, NNH 11 CI 5 to 113).</P>
<P>ESRS scores from two trials provide skewed data but do not clearly suggest differences between the two drugs. </P>
<P>2.3.6 Gastrointestinal system<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Conley-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Conley 2001</LINK> reported 'any gastrointestinal system adverse events' and found that people given risperidone were no more likely to experience these compared with those given olanzapine (n=377, RR 0.14 CI 0.01 to 2.76). </P>
<P>Five studies provided data on various gastrointestinal adverse events. People given risperidone were no more likely to experience specific symptoms such as abdominal pain, diarrhoea, dyspepsia, dysphagia, increased appetite, nausea, vomiting and increased SGPT levels compared to those allocated olanzapine. However people on risperidone were more likely to have constipation compared to those on olanzapine (n=659, RR 2.09 CI 1.15 to 3.82 NNH 18 CI 7 to 31).</P>
<P>2.3.7 Haematological system<BR/>There was no difference between people given risperidone or olanzapine experiencing agranulocytosis, anaemia, blood dyscrasia or neutropenia. There are very few data and confidence intervals are wide (n=122, 2 RCTs, RR neutropenia 1.31 CI 0.10 to 17.87) but from these data it is possible that 1-2% of people allocated these drugs experience this adverse effect.</P>
<P>2.3.8 Metabolic parameters<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Volavka-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Volavka 2002</LINK> reported data on patients developing abnormal glucose levels classed as &gt;125mg/dl and found no difference between the risperidone and olanzapine groups (n=48 RR 0.89 CI 0.22 to 3.54). Skewed data for average change did suggest a larger change for people allocated olanzapine. </P>
<P>Two studies reported data on average change in cholesterol levels. <LINK REF="STD-Volavka-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Volavka 2002</LINK> reported data on short and medium term and <LINK REF="STD-CATIE-2005" TYPE="STUDY">CATIE 2005</LINK> reported data on long term change. Data from both these studies are skewed but do suggest higher cholesterol levels in people allocated to olanzapine. In terms of average change in blood glucose levels, <LINK REF="STD-Volavka-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Volavka 2002</LINK> reports data in the short and medium term and <LINK REF="STD-CATIE-2005" TYPE="STUDY">CATIE 2005</LINK> has reported data in the medium and long term. Again both these sets of data are skewed although people given risperidone appear less likely to have higher blood glucose levels. <LINK REF="STD-CATIE-2005" TYPE="STUDY">CATIE 2005</LINK> has also reported data on average change in glycosylated haemoglobin and triglyceride levels in the long term and although these data are skewed as well, they appear to favour risperidone.</P>
<P>2.3.9 Weight Gain<BR/>People allocated to risperidone were less likely to gain weight compared with those given olanzapine (n=781, 3 RCTs, RR any gain 0.61CI 0.41 to 0.91, NNH 18 CI 12 to 76). In the short term those given risperidone were less likely to gain more than 7% of their baseline weight compared with olanzapine (n=984, 2 RCTs, RR 0.47 CI 0.36 to 0.61, NNH 7 CI 6 to 10). However, when it came to a gain of more than 20% of baseline, people allocated risperidone were no less likely to gain this amount of weight compared with those who received olanzapine (n=377, 1 RCT, RR 0.11 CI 0.01 to 2.06). In the long term, <LINK REF="STD-CATIE-2005" TYPE="STUDY">CATIE 2005</LINK> reported LOCF data on weight gain. People on risperidone were significantly less likely to gain weight compared to olanzapine (n=607, 1 RCT, RR0.47 CI 0.34 to 0.65). <LINK REF="STD-CATIE-2005" TYPE="STUDY">CATIE 2005</LINK> also reported that people on risperidone were less likely to leave the study due to metabolic side effects and weight gain compared to olanzapine (n=667, 1RCT, RR 0.19 CI 0.08 to 0.45)</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Tran-1997-_x0028_HGBG_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Tran 1997 (HGBG)</LINK> reported data on medium term average total body weight and found no difference between risperidone and olanzapine. The average difference in total body weight at the longer term study end points favours risperidone with a difference of nearly 9kg (n=108, 2 RCTs, WMD -8.8 CI -16.3 to -1.49). <LINK REF="STD-CATIE-2005" TYPE="STUDY">CATIE 2005</LINK> reported data on average change in cholesterol and average change in glucose levels and both these tended to favour risperidone significantly. In the long term <LINK REF="STD-CATIE-2005" TYPE="STUDY">CATIE 2005</LINK> reported weight change and found that people on olanzapine were likely to gain about 4kgs (n=607, 1RCT, WMD -3.84 CI -5.77 to -1.91). Also <LINK REF="STD-CATIE-2005" TYPE="STUDY">CATIE 2005</LINK> reported weight change in pounds per month of treatment which we converted to kilograms and found that people on risperidone gained about three quarters of a kilogram less per month compared to those on olanzapine although this just fell short of being of statistical significance (n=607, 1 RCT , WMD -0.72 CI -1.54to -0.10). Six studies report weight change but all data are skewed and problematic to present graphically. All six trials suggest olanzapine has a greater tendency to increase weight. Average BMI increases support the findings presented above. Only <LINK REF="STD-Chan-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Chan 2003</LINK> reported total weight gain in the long term, but this data is skewed and shows no difference between risperidone and olanzapine. </P>
<P>2.3.10 Respiratory system<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Purdon-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Purdon 1998</LINK> (n=42) reported symptoms such as cough and respiratory disorder and found no difference between risperidone and olanzapine. Both symptoms were rare. </P>
<P>2.3.11 Self harm/death<BR/>Only seven of the included studies reported this important outcome measure. By and large death was a rare occurrence in the two groups (2/618 people died). Less than 2% of the participants in both groups are reported to have attempted suicide. There was no difference in terms of suicidal ideation between the risperidone and olanzapine groups. </P>
<P>2.3.12 Sexual side effects<BR/>Patients on risperidone were more likely to experience abnormal ejaculation compared with those on olanzapine (n=370, 2 RCTs, RR 4.36 CI 1.38 to 13.76, NNH 20 CI 6 to 176). Patients on risperidone or olanzapine were equally likely to suffer from impotency (n=31, 1 RCT, RR 2.43 CI 0.24 to 24.07). Similarly male sexual dysfunction and decreased sex drive, arousal or ability to reach orgasm was no different in people on risperidone compared with those on olanzapine.</P>
<P>2.3.13 Other adverse events<BR/>Several other adverse effects were reported in studies and they are summarised in this outcome. Risperidone was more likely to cause backache compared with olanzapine (n=381, 2RCTs, RR 1.97 CI 1.04 to 3.73, NNH 16 CI 6 to 374). There was no difference between risperidone and olanzapine on all other measures which included allergic reaction, anxiety, asthenia, breathing difficulty, dysuria, gynaecomastia, myasthenia, photosensitivity, pruritis, psychosis, pyrexia, rash and urinary incontinence and nocturia. </P>
<P>2.4 Quality of life<BR/>Two trials measured quality of life in two different ways. There was no indication of differences between the two drugs (n=301, 2 RCTs, WMD average medium term QoL endpoint score 0.94 CI -7.14 to 9.02).</P>
<P>2.5 Leaving the study early<BR/>In the short term, participants given risperidone were no more likely to leave the study than those given olanzapine (n=1217, 7 RCTs, RR 1.17 CI 0.92 to 1.49). However in the medium term, people on risperidone were more likely to leave the study early for any reason than those on olanzapine (n=509, 4 RCTs, RR 1.33 CI 1.10 to 1.61). The same finding was reflected in longer term studies as well (n=1440, 5 RCT's RR 1.17 CI 1.08 to 1.27). </P>
<P>When reasons were specified for leaving the study early, whether due to lack of efficacy or adverse effects, there was no indication that one drug had any advantage over the other (n=1361, 4 RCTs, RR leaving due to adverse effects in the long term 0.98 CI 0.53 to 1.80). However, more people from the olanzapine arm left the study early compared to risperidone due to weight gain and metabolic side effects (n=663, 1RCT, RR 0.19 CI 0.08 to 0.45 NNH 14 CI 12 to 20).</P>
<P>2.6 Economic outcomes<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Namjoshi-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Namjoshi 2002</LINK> reported the median total health service costs of treatment for risperidone to be US$ 1667.44 and for olanzapine to be US$ 1014.4. The study authors did not report any variance or statistical comparison of these figures. A USA subset of <LINK REF="STD-Tran-1997-_x0028_HGBG_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Tran 1997 (HGBG)</LINK> reported the drug cost of risperidone and olanzapine at 28 weeks to be US$ 1581 (risperidone) and US$ 2513 (olanzapine) and claimed a total cost including outpatient/inpatient service cost and medication cost as lower in olanzapine group (US$5141 for olanzapine and US$7984 for risperidone) although this was not statistically significant (p value 0.342).</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>1. Applicability of findings<BR/>Only two studies were international multicentre trials (<LINK REF="STD-Jeste-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Jeste 2003</LINK> and Tran 1997 (HGBG). Nine trials were conducted exclusively in North America (United States and Canada). The majority of trials with the exception of <LINK REF="STD-CATIE-2005" TYPE="STUDY">CATIE 2005</LINK> involved people in hospital with little in the way of physical and psychiatric co-morbidity. Participants had well-defined schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. Such people are a minority in everyday care (<LINK REF="REF-Kelly-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kelly 1998</LINK>). Most people with schizophrenia-like illnesses are not in hospital and present a less well defined illness combined with problems such as depression and substance abuse. As a result the reader is left with a difficult decision. Although <LINK REF="STD-CATIE-2005" TYPE="STUDY">CATIE 2005</LINK> was a large pragmatic trial, the results did not favour one particular drug. These studies may generate useful hypothesis for the effects of these drugs in a particular setting, however, until more studies are undertaken involving a greater cross section of people in different settings, we cannot be fully sure of how this informs clinical care of people with schizophrenia and other problems in the global context. </P>
<P>2. Limited data, confusing data<BR/>Risperidone and olanzapine are the biggest selling new generation antipsychotic drugs and only three studies reports outcome data at or beyond 52 weeks (<LINK REF="STD-CATIE-2005" TYPE="STUDY">CATIE 2005</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Keefe-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Keefe 2005</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Purdon-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Purdon 1998</LINK>).Considering that schizophrenia is a chronic relapsing and remitting disorder and that these drugs are likely to be used by people with schizophrenia for long periods, we would have expected more data relevant to periods beyond 12 weeks. Much data were lost because of attrition (see Methods 4.2). The enormous degree of loss to follow up is common in similar studies of other compounds (<LINK REF="REF-Wahlbeck-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wahlbeck 2001</LINK>), but rare in everyday practice. This also limits the applicability of findings to routine care. </P>
<P>We found it disappointing that, despite considerable investment in clinical trials, in most of the studies data on death, service outcomes, general functioning, behaviour, engagement with services, and satisfaction with treatment, economic outcomes and cognitive functioning was not reported. The primary outcome of this review was relapse or rehospitalization. Data were only available on this in the <LINK REF="STD-Namjoshi-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Namjoshi 2002</LINK> study (n=364). We find this limited data on such pivotal treatments surprising and concerning. </P>
<P>Study attrition and poor reporting further limited the information available to us. People leave trials for many reasons that are often not specified by the trial reports. Frequently their last observation is carried forward to the end of the trial on the assumption that they stayed stable from the point of exit from the trial to the trial end. This type of data, even though acceptable for regulatory purposes, carries a huge amount of assumption and could even be used to mask effects. Of course attrition is a problem, but using assumptions that cannot be tested does not rectify this problem.</P>
<P>Several trials only reported adverse effects which occurred in at least 5% or 10% of participants (<LINK REF="STD-Gureje-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Gureje 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Jeste-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Jeste 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Keefe-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Keefe 2005</LINK>). This could lead to non-recognition of potentially serious but less frequent outcomes. Small randomised trials are limited in their power to highlight important rare outcomes so further restriction of reported data seems odd. We note that the design of the trials did not limit reporting of positive outcomes to only those that occurred at least 5% to 10% of the time. </P>
<P>Poor reporting remains a problem. Trialists tended to report mean figures without giving standard deviations. Also many collect important data such as Clinical Global Impression which could be reported not only as continuous endpoint and change data but also as binary outcomes such as 'improved' or 'not improved'. The continuous data are difficult to interpret and the reporting of binary data would have facilitated better understanding of clinical trials. </P>
<P>Much of the data were obtained from conference proceedings and posters. This made extraction difficult as results were often summarised. Several studies were multiply reported. Without unique study identifiers this gives impression that there are more data than actually exist and facilitates erroneous double counting. A large number of studies which may have been of use in the review could not be included due to lack of data. With more and full online dissemination of results, such as the embryonic but welcome new website of Eli Lilly (http://www.lillytrials.com/) this avoidable limitation of data may be reduced. </P>
<P>3. Comparison 1: RISPERIDONE versus OLANZAPINE<BR/>3.1 Global effect<BR/>Most measures of global effect suggested no clear difference between the two drugs. Binary ratings of 'unchanged or worse' or 'moderate or more severely ill' were equivocal and the continuous measures on the same scales almost impossible to interpret. We are not clear why the data on use of additional benzodiazepines should be so heterogeneous and can only suspect it reflects some difference in clinical protocol. </P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Namjoshi-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Namjoshi 2002</LINK> reported relapse or rehospitalisation and favoured olanzapine for this important outcome (NNH 7 CI 3 to 25). Criteria for rehospitalisation in this study were not clearly defined and could have been very different from routine clinical care, but this number needed to treat is low. This finding needs further replication and could prove very important but at present must be treated with caution. <LINK REF="STD-Namjoshi-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Namjoshi 2002</LINK> was funded by a company with a pecuniary interest in olanzapine.</P>
<P>3.2 Mental state<BR/>Most binary measures of overall mental state response show no clear difference between the compounds. The most extreme definition of response (&gt; 50% decrease in PANSS scores), however, favours olanzapine, although the number needed to treat is high (n=339, 1 RCT, NNT 12 CI 6 to127). This is an intriguing finding from a single study <LINK REF="STD-Tran-1997-_x0028_HGBG_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Tran 1997 (HGBG)</LINK> and should be replicated. <LINK REF="STD-Tran-1997-_x0028_HGBG_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Tran 1997 (HGBG)</LINK> was a study funded by Eli Lilly and company.</P>
<P>The continuous mental state scores also tend to favour olanzapine but the average difference in PANSS score of about six points may not be clinically meaningful.</P>
<P>PANSS negative and positive symptom sub scores as well as measures of depression, cognitive function and obsessive-compulsive symptoms are unconvincing of any meaningful difference in the drugs. </P>
<P>3.3 Adverse events<BR/>We were concerned that reporting of adverse effects could have been biased. For example <LINK REF="STD-Purdon-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Purdon 1998</LINK> recorded over 130 adverse effects ranging from nail disorder to yawning. Easily monitored adverse effects such as weight gain were not mentioned. <LINK REF="STD-Purdon-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Purdon 1998</LINK> was funded by the manufacturers of olanzapine; an atypical antipsychotic known to cause weight gain (see below).</P>
<P>We have tried to arrange the considerable amount of adverse effect data in a useful way. On most measures of adverse events there was no difference between the risperidone and olanzapine groups. However, about two thirds of people given risperidone or olanzapine experienced an adverse event worthy of recording. In the first part of the discussion section we note how in several studies adverse effects were not recorded unless encountered in 5% to 10% of people. We feel that two thirds is likely to be an underestimate and results show that these drugs are by no means free from adverse effects. </P>
<P>In the cardiovascular system there are no clear suggestions from QTc studies that either drug causes problems but olanzapine was associated with more cardiovascular events than risperidone although this did not meet conventional levels of statistical significance. These data come from one study <LINK REF="STD-Conley-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Conley 2001</LINK>
<B> </B>funded by Janssen Research Foundation. (n=377, RR 0.14 CI 0.01 to 2.76). </P>
<P>About 20% of participants in these trials experienced a range of anticholinergic symptoms. People given risperidone were more likely to experience insomnia compared with those given olanzapine (NNH 15 CI 9 to 41). Sleep disturbance was common in both groups (~25%) and sleepiness more so (~30%). Menstrual disorders may occur but there are too few data from small studies to be certain. </P>
<P>It has been asserted without any real evidence that people prefer to take these newer drugs than the older antipsychotics; however this may reflect marketing techniques used by the manufacturers. <B> </B>This so-called preference for the newer drugs is said to be partly due to less sedation and fewer problematic movement disorders. These advantages may be real but also could be due to better management of dosages with the newer compounds. Often too high a dose of older drugs was given to people with schizophrenia when lower doses could have had an antipsychotic effect without the problematic extrapyramidal symptoms (<LINK REF="REF-Hunter-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hunter 2003</LINK>). Even on these new drugs, about 22% of people on risperidone and 18% on olanzapine experienced some extrapyramidal symptom (n=893, 3 RCTs, RR any extrapyramidal symptom 1.18 CI 0.75 to 1.88). 25% of those on risperidone and 18% on olanzapine required medication to alleviate extrapyramidal adverse effects (n=419, 2 RCTs, RR at 12 weeks to 12 months 1.76 CI 1.25 to 2.48, NNH 8 CI 4 to 25), although beyond that period, with the inclusion of data from <LINK REF="STD-CATIE-2005" TYPE="STUDY">CATIE 2005</LINK>, there was no difference between groups with under 10% of each group needing the additional medication. Of the two RCTs included in this parameter, <LINK REF="STD-Tran-1997-_x0028_HGBG_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Tran 1997 (HGBG)</LINK> was funded by Eli Lilly and 18% of the total cost of the <LINK REF="STD-Volavka-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Volavka 2002</LINK> study was funded by Eli Lilly although Janssen did supply medications for the trial. There were many movement disorder measures that were equivocal but some suggested that risperidone was more implicated than olanzapine (n=339, 1RCT funded by Eli Lilly, RR new parkinsonism symptoms 1.73, CI 1.07 to 2.81, NNH 11 CI 5 to 113). We have no data from trials on the incidence of tardive dyskinesia for these drugs. Both drugs are not entirely free of troublesome movement disorders which people with schizophrenia and their clinicians have had to tolerate for decades with use of the older generation drugs (<LINK REF="REF-Joy-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Joy 2001</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Thornley-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thornley 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>Neither drug had any convincing effects on the gastrointestinal system.</P>
<P>There are few data on the effects of the drugs on the blood system but if the finding that one to two percent of people acquire neutropenia is true this could have major implications for these drugs. We are not sure if the levels of neutropenia are clinically significant. </P>
<P>Data suggest that olanzapine does elevate cholesterol, blood sugar and triglyceride levels. All indicators point to olanzapine being associated with weight gain. People allocated to risperidone were less likely to gain weight compared with those given olanzapine (n=781, 3 RCTs, RR any gain 0.61CI 0.41 to 0.91, NNH 18 CI 12 to 76) and also in the short term people given risperidone were less likely to gain &gt;7% of their baseline weight (n=984, 2 RCTs, RR 0.47 CI 0.36 to 0.61, NNH 7 CI 6 to 10). Although the finding for 20% gain was not statistically significant (n=377, 1 RCT, RR 0.11 CI 0.01 to 2.06), four people out of 189 (2%) allocated to olanzapine did gain this substantial amount of weight. The average difference in total body weight at the longer term study suggests a difference in gain of nearly 9kg<B>. </B>The <LINK REF="STD-CATIE-2005" TYPE="STUDY">CATIE 2005</LINK> data also mirrored the findings that olanzapine causes significantly more weight gain than risperidone (n=607, 1 RCT, RR0.47 CI 0.34 to 0.65). Also this study reported that weight gain or metabolic issues led to significantly fewer people in the risperidone arm leaving the study owing to these reasons compared to olanzapine (n=667, 1RCT, RR 0.19 CI 0.08 to 0.45). Weight gain is consistently more problematic for olanzapine than for risperidone.</P>
<P>We should have more data on weight. More people have been randomised and had their weight monitored than reflected in the data available here (see comment above regarding <LINK REF="STD-Purdon-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Purdon 1998</LINK>). In addition, it is odd why one study (<LINK REF="STD-Conley-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Conley 2001</LINK>, funded by Janssen Research Foundation) should choose a 7% cut off for weight gain with no mention of this figure in the methodology sections of the reports. This cut off as 7% is subsequently used in other studies as well (e.g. <LINK REF="STD-CATIE-2005" TYPE="STUDY">CATIE 2005</LINK>) and soon seems to become the accepted standard although we are not sure of the validity or significance of this measurement. Some trials report average weight change and average BMI increase which contained skewed data and consequently difficult to interpret. As a result, a simple question about how many will gain weight following treatment is difficult to answer because not all studies report data in simple comparable terms. When data are presented in multiple ways it clouds the issue. However, even with these problems, there seems little doubt that olanzapine can cause rapid weight gain. This is likely to have long term consequences on their health and quality of life. </P>
<P>Both drugs do not seem to have any effects on the respiratory system. Death and suicidal attempts have not been well reported. These have been reported in only seven of the trials and are simple outcomes to report which have important clinical implications. Although the numbers may have been small, reporting this outcome would be reassuring that these drugs are not associated with high mortality rates. Patients on risperidone were more likely to experience abnormal ejaculation compared with those on olanzapine (NNH 20 CI 6 to 176) and though there was no statistically significant difference in one small study on impotence (n=31, 1 RCT, RR 2.43 CI 0.24 to 24.07), there is a worry that in a larger study with more statistical power there may have been a significant difference. Surveys of patient's attitudes to medication have shown that it is not necessarily the movement disorders that are perceived as most problematic (<LINK REF="REF-RETHINK-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">RETHINK 2000</LINK>). Women with schizophrenia often complain of weight gain and men complain of sexual problems. These new drugs are implicated in causing these problems on a level comparable to the older generation of drugs.</P>
<P>It is difficult to explain why risperidone seemed more likely to cause backache and headaches compared with olanzapine or why olanzapine causes more dry mouth compared to risperidone, but such effects need to be monitored in routine practice. </P>
<P>3.4 Quality of life <BR/>These data are problematic to interpret. We are not sure if they are really meaningful but there seems to be no real difference between the drugs. We look forward to forthcoming data from <LINK REF="STD-CATIE-2005" TYPE="STUDY">CATIE 2005</LINK>. </P>
<P>3.5 Leaving the study early<BR/>In the short term, participants given risperidone were no more likely to leave the study than those given olanzapine (n=1217, 7 RCTs, RR 1.17 CI 0.92 to 1.49). In the medium term and long term however more people in the risperidone groups were likely to leave the study early compared to olanzapine for any reason (n=509, 4 RCTs, RR likely to leave the study early in medium term 1.33 CI 1.10 to 1.61) and well (n=1440, 5 RCT's RR likely to leave early in the long term 1.17 CI 1.08 to 1.27). </P>
<P>When reasons were specified for leaving the study early, such as due to lack of efficacy or adverse effects there was no indication at all that one drug had advantage over the other (n=1361, 4 RCTs, RR leaving due to adverse effects in the long term 0.98 CI 0.53 to 1.80). Interestingly however more people left the study early in the olanzapine group due to weight gain and metabolic side effects (NNH 14 CI 12 to 20).</P>
<P>The attrition rates from all these studies were quite high (more than 20%). This seems as much to do with study design as with the drugs themselves. This level, however, is less than that reported in other evaluations of new drugs (<LINK REF="REF-Duggan-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Duggan 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Srisurapanont-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Srisurapanont 2004</LINK>) which is encouraging. Much data were still lost because of attrition and enormous assumptions were again made for outcomes leaving substantial possibility for bias. Nevertheless there is some hope that those designing studies are aiming for less attrition than before. </P>
<P>3.6 Economic outcomes<BR/>There are great problems with the economic data. The few data available seem to be presented in a way that makes it particularly difficult to utilise. <LINK REF="STD-Namjoshi-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Namjoshi 2002</LINK> (funded by ELi Lilly) argues that costs are less per patient for olanzapine than for risperidone. <LINK REF="STD-Tran-1997-_x0028_HGBG_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Tran 1997 (HGBG)</LINK> (funded by Eli Lilly) argue that the drug costs are lower for risperidone but the total mental health costs favour olanzapine. Overall the company funding the trial seems to purport that their compound turns out to be a cheaper alternative than the comparator by means of various elaborate explanations.</P>
<P>3.7 Missing outcomes<BR/>In these highly marketed new drugs we know little from evaluative studies about service outcomes, general functioning and behaviour, engagement with services and satisfaction with treatment. Exactly what advantages these compounds offer to patient care remains unclear.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>1. For people with schizophrenia<BR/>There is little to choose between risperidone and olanzapine except on the issue of adverse effects. The effects these drugs have on symptoms of illness seem similar, although some data did suggest that those on olanzapine experienced less hospital readmission. This important finding should be replicated in further studies. Both these drugs have troublesome adverse effects. Both drugs are associated with sleep disturbance; especially sedation. Risperidone is associated with movement disorders and sexual dysfunction. Olanzapine causes rapid weight gain which can be considerable. Olanzapine also causes dry mouth. </P>
<P>2. For clinicians<BR/>Global effect suggests that there is no clear difference between risperidone and olanzapine apart from the fact that for the outcome of re-hospitalisation olanzapine fared better, though this needs to be replicated. On one sub-scale score, of one mental state rating scale, olanzapine shows superiority over risperidone on the PANSS scale but this result is difficult to interpret clinically and could be a chance finding. Replication is needed in large simple studies and such findings should not form the evidence base of treatment recommendations. Olanzapine seems to have fewer extrapyramidal effects than risperidone and less tendency to cause sexual dysfunction. With the available data, olanzapine seems to encourage rapid weight gain but it is unclear whether this initial gain continues while the person is taking olanzapine or if the weight is lost when the drug is stopped. Currently not enough data relating to those with treatment-resistant schizophrenia are available for conclusions to be drawn. </P>
<P>3. For managers/policy makers<BR/>Risperidone and olanzapine are expensive drugs and economic data are uninformative. There is some evidence that patients prefer these drugs to the older generation of medications (<LINK REF="REF-RETHINK-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">RETHINK 2000</LINK>) but in many cases the older drugs were used in too high doses leading to adverse effects. Risperidone and olanzapine seem equally clinically effective although the absolute effects may not be great and data are remarkably poor in places (<LINK REF="REF-Duggan-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Duggan 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Hunter-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hunter 2003</LINK>). Patients should be informed of problematic adverse effects.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>1. General<BR/>Clear and strict adherence to the CONSORT statement (<LINK REF="REF-Moher-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 2001</LINK>) for all outcomes may have resulted in this review being more informative. Full availability of data from each study, a potential with Eli Lilly's site (http://www.lillytrials.com/) could greatly help future reviewers. Currently, even in these studies presumably acceptable to regulatory authorities, denominator data were not always clearly presented, allocation concealment is not mentioned, results are frequently described as 'significant' or not, but raw data were not reported.</P>
<P>2. Specific<BR/>2.1 International RCT number (INRCTN)<BR/>We have had to inspect a very great number of presentations of the few trials included in this review and it is likely that many more remain untraced. Using specific trial identifiers, within the multiple publications, would greatly decrease confusion over identification of the source trial. </P>
<P>2.2 Too few data<BR/>More well planned, conducted and reported randomised controlled trials of longer duration are needed to address important, clinically relevant outcomes. Even though 16 studies were included in this review, few clinically meaningful results could be summated due to lack of uniformity of reporting similar outcome measures. . We do not know the long term consequences of using these popular treatments and have information on few short term outcomes that are really clinically meaningful. We know little in terms of service outcomes. High-quality trial-derived data relating to simple mental state, global improvement, hospital admission, satisfaction with care, family burden, employment, and important adverse effects are either minimal or absent altogether. Useful data on cost-effectiveness must be a research priority.</P>
<P>Funding that is as free of conflicts of interest as possible is justified.</P>
