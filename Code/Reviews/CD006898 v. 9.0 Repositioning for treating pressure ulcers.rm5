<P>Pressure ulcers (also known as bed sores, pressure sores and decubitus ulcers) are localised areas of tissue damage caused by excess pressure and shearing forces. Pressure ulcers mainly occur in people who have limited mobility, nerve damage or both. Pressure, from lying or sitting on a particular part of the body, results in oxygen and nutrient deprivation to the affected area. Repositioning involves moving the individual into a different position in order to remove or redistribute pressure from a part of the body. If a person with an existing pressure ulcer continues to lie or bear weight on the affected area, the tissues become depleted of blood flow and there is no oxygen or nutrient supply to the wound, and no removal of waste products from the wound, all of which are necessary for healing. People who cannot reposition themselves require assistance. International best practice advocates the use of repositioning as an integral component of a pressure ulcer management strategy. The authors of this review found no studies that were eligible for inclusion in the review. Therefore, we do not know whether repositioning people makes any difference to the healing rates of pressure ulcers.</P>

<P>A pressure ulcer is defined as localised injury to the skin, underlying tissue or both, usually over a bony prominence, as a result of pressure, or pressure in combination with shear. A number of contributing or confounding factors are also associated with pressure ulcers; the significance of these factors is yet to be elucidated (<LINK REF="REF-EPUAP_x002f_NPUAP-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">EPUAP/NPUAP 2009</LINK>). Because exposure to sustained mechanical loading is the prime factor contributing to pressure ulcer development, they commonly occur in people who do not have the ability to reposition themselves in order to relieve pressure (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2011</LINK>). Those most at risk are the very old, the malnourished and those with acute illness (<LINK REF="REF-Wann_x002d_Hanson-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wann-Hanson 2008</LINK>). Pressure ulcer prevalence and incidence figures differ depending on the method of data collection and the classification used. Prevalence rates fluctuate from 8.8% to 53.2% (<LINK REF="REF-Gallagher-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gallagher 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moore-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2012</LINK>) and incidence rates vary from 7% to 71.6% (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Scott-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scott 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Whittington-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Whittington 2004</LINK>). The most common anatomical sites for pressure ulcers to occur are the sacrum and the heels, and the majority are grade 1 or grade 2 in severity (<LINK REF="REF-Gallagher-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gallagher 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gethin-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gethin 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moore-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moore-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2011</LINK>)</P>
<P>Pressure ulcers have a negative impact on quality of life; it is known that individuals with pressure ulcers frequently experience pain combined with fear, isolation and anxiety regarding wound healing (<LINK REF="REF-Hopkins-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hopkins 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gorecki-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gorecki 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Spilsbury-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spilsbury 2007</LINK>). Pressure ulcers are also associated with increased mortality (<LINK REF="REF-Kroger-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kroger 2008</LINK>). Whether this relates to the fact that pressure ulcers occur in a population that is for the most part debilitated, with a high incidence of co-morbidities, or whether it relates to the presence of a pressure ulcer alone, remains unclear (<LINK REF="REF-Brown-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brown 2003</LINK>). However, the evidence suggests an almost two-fold increase in death among those with pressure ulcers when compared to their matched counterparts without pressure ulcers (<LINK REF="REF-Landi-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Landi 2007</LINK>)</P>
<P>Pressure ulcers are a significant financial burden to healthcare systems. <LINK REF="REF-Bennett-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bennett 2004</LINK> suggested that the total annual cost for pressure ulcer management in the UK is £1.4 to £2.1 billion (UKPound), which at that time was equivalent to 4% of the total UK healthcare expenditure. Similar findings have been noted in the Netherlands, where pressure ulcers have been found to be the third most expensive health problem (<LINK REF="REF-Haalboom-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haalboom 2000</LINK>). More recently, <LINK REF="REF-Dealey-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dealey 2012</LINK> notes that the cost of treating pressure ulcers relates to the severity of the wound, with costs increasing from £1,214 for a grade 1 pressure ulcer, to £14,108 for a grade 4 pressure ulcer. Furthermore, it has been shown that older persons with pressure ulcers have a longer overall hospital stay and a higher excess length of stay compared with similar cases without a pressure ulcer (<LINK REF="REF-Theisen-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Theisen 2012</LINK>).</P>
<P>Globally, the exact economic impact of pressure ulcers has yet to be established, however it is known that pressure ulcers are common (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2012</LINK>) and affect patients in both community (<LINK REF="REF-Margolis-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Margolis 2002</LINK>) and hospital settings (<LINK REF="REF-Gallagher-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gallagher 2008</LINK>). Although individuals of any age can develop pressure ulcers, they are more common in groups of people such as the elderly (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2012</LINK>) and those in orthopaedic settings (<LINK REF="REF-Remaley-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Remaley 2010</LINK>), though other medical conditions can predispose individuals to their development (<LINK REF="REF-Schoonhoven-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schoonhoven 2002</LINK>). Changing demographics, and the rise in the number of elderly in the future, mean that the number of pressure ulcers is likely to increase in the years ahead. Therefore, it is reasonable to expect that treatment strategies that reduce the impact of pressure ulcers will have a positive impact on patients and the health service as a whole (<LINK REF="REF-Dealey-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dealey 2012</LINK>).</P>

<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2012-07-20 14:49:53 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Wound healing is a normal response to injury. It is initiated after the skin's integrity has been interrupted, for example, by the development of a pressure ulcer (<LINK REF="REF-Martin-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Martin 1997</LINK>). The purpose of the healing process is to replace the tissue that has been damaged, with living tissue, and to restore the continuity of the skin (<LINK REF="REF-Tarnuzzer-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tarnuzzer 1996</LINK>). Open wounds, including pressure ulcers, heal through formation of granulation tissue and epithelialisation (<LINK REF="REF-Slavin-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Slavin 1996</LINK>). Granulation tissue is characterised by a high density of blood vessels, capillaries and many different cells, so the metabolic need of the wounded area is great (<LINK REF="REF-Krishnamoothy-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Krishnamoothy 2001</LINK>). Normal cellular metabolism requires an adequate supply of oxygen and nutrients, and also an effective elimination of waste metabolites (<LINK REF="REF-Kosiak-1966" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kosiak 1966</LINK>). Sustained unrelieved pressure causes vascular obstruction that eliminates capillary blood flow to an area (<LINK REF="REF-Kosiak-1959" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kosiak 1959</LINK>), causing oxygen and nutrient deprivation there (<LINK REF="REF-Husain-1953" TYPE="REFERENCE">Husain 1953</LINK>). Since the cells necessary for wound healing cannot proliferate in such an environment, wound healing is impaired (<LINK REF="REF-Kosiak-1966" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kosiak 1966</LINK>). Certain positioning techniques, for example, 90-degree lateral rotation, which is used during bed rest, may exacerbate this situation and cause complete anoxia (lack of oxygen) to the weight-bearing area (<LINK REF="REF-Colin-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Colin 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sache-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sache 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Seiler-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Seiler 1986</LINK>). Since it is possible that a patient may be positioned directly onto a pressure ulcer, especially when multiple ulcers are present, the impact that this may have on wound healing is an important consideration.</P>
<P>The management of people with pressure ulcers involves numerous different interventions including nutritional care (<LINK REF="REF-EPUAP-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">EPUAP 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Langer-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Langer 2003</LINK>), pressure reducing/relieving surfaces (<LINK REF="REF-McInnes-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">McInnes 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McInnes-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">McInnes 2008</LINK>), and skin and wound care (<LINK REF="REF-Butcher-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Butcher 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moore-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2005</LINK>). Repositioning people is also an important component in the management of pressure ulcers (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2012</LINK>). Pressure, from lying or sitting on a particular part of the body, results in oxygen deprivation to the affected area (<LINK REF="REF-Defloor-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Defloor 2005</LINK>). This normally results in pain and discomfort which stimulates the individual to move. Failure to reposition will result in ongoing oxygen deprivation, poor wound healing and further tissue damage (<LINK REF="REF-Defloor-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Defloor 2005</LINK>). People who cannot reposition themselves require assistance. International best practice advocates the use of repositioning as an integral component of a pressure ulcer management strategy. Although repositioning is advocated, confusion exists about the frequency and exact method of repositioning required: the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research, USA advocates two-hourly repositioning (<LINK REF="REF-AHCPR-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">AHCPR 1992</LINK>), whereas the European Pressure Ulcer Advisory Panel &amp; National Pressure Ulcer Advisory Panel and the National Institute for Clinical Excellence, UK advocate repositioning as required by the individual patient (<LINK REF="REF-EPUAP_x002f_NPUAP-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">EPUAP/NPUAP 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NICE-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2005</LINK>). This lack of unity necessitated a systematic review of the literature to summarise the current evidence. The review may provide a contribution to relevant clinical guidelines. In addition, the review informs research in this important area of patient care.</P>

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2012-07-20 15:01:12 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The quality of studies was to be assessed independently by two authors, without blinding to journal or authorship, using the Cochrane Collaboration tool for assessing risk of bias (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). This tool addresses six specific domains, namely sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding, incomplete outcome data, selective outcome reporting and other issues (e.g. extreme baseline imbalance) (see <LINK REF="APP-01" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 1</LINK> for details of the criteria on which the judgements are based). We planned to assess blinding and completeness of outcome data for each outcome separately. We planned to complete a 'Risk of bias' table for each eligible study. We would have discussed any disagreement amongst all authors to achieve a consensus.</P>
<P>We planned to present assessment of risk of bias using a 'Risk of bias' summary figure, which presents all of the judgments in a cross-tabulation of study by entry. This display of internal validity indicates the weight the reader may give the results of each study.</P>

<P>We planned to explore clinical heterogeneity by examining potentially influential factors, e.g. care setting or patient characteristics. Statistical heterogeneity was to be assessed using the I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2003</LINK>). This examines the percentage of total variation across studies due to heterogeneity rather than chance. Values of I<SUP>2</SUP> over 75% indicate a high level of heterogeneity. If there were sufficiently similar studies to consider pooling, we planned to use a fixed-effect model for low to moderate levels of heterogeneity (I<SUP>2</SUP> 0% to 50%). If there was evidence of heterogeneity (values of I<SUP>2</SUP> over 50%) we planned to use a random-effects model.

<P>We identified no eligible studies despite our having made every attempt to identify all relevant studies, including contacting experts in this field and searching conference proceedings to identify studies as yet unpublished.

<P>In order to maintain health, tissues require an adequate supply of oxygen and nutrients (<LINK REF="REF-Gottrup-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gottrup 2004</LINK>). Pressure from lying or sitting on a particular part of the body results in oxygen deprivation to the affected area (<LINK REF="REF-Defloor-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Defloor 2005</LINK>). There are normally a number of stimulators, during sleep and whilst awake, that motivate the individual to move (<LINK REF="REF-Krapfl-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Krapfl 2008</LINK>). Failure to reposition will result in ongoing oxygen deprivation and inevitable tissue damage (<LINK REF="REF-Defloor-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Defloor 2005</LINK>), because of ongoing occlusion of blood supply to the affected area (<LINK REF="REF-Husain-1953" TYPE="REFERENCE">Husain 1953</LINK>). Repositioning is advocated as one of the interventions needed for the management of pressure ulcers and involves moving the individual into a different position in order to remove or redistribute pressure from a particular part of the body (<LINK REF="REF-Krapfl-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Krapfl 2008</LINK>). The two concerns are firstly, the individual's ability to feel pain and secondly, the individual's actual physical ability to move or to reposition themselves (<LINK REF="REF-Defloor-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Defloor 2005</LINK>). In the absence of the patient having the ability to reposition, they require assistance (<LINK REF="REF-AHCPR-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">AHCPR 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-EPUAP_x002f_NPUAP-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">EPUAP/NPUAP 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NICE-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>Wound healing is a normal response to injury and is initiated following interruption of the skins integrity. The purpose of this process is to replace the damaged tissue with living tissue and to restore the continuity of the skin. This occurs as a result of a finely balanced sequence of events, which are regulated by growth factors, cytokines and matrix metalloproteinases (<LINK REF="REF-Tarnuzzer-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tarnuzzer 1996</LINK>). Open wounds, including pressure ulcers, heal through formation of granulation tissue and epithelialisation (<LINK REF="REF-Slavin-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Slavin 1996</LINK>). Granulation tissue is characterised by a high density of blood vessels, capillaries and many different cells, so the metabolic need of the wounded area is great (<LINK REF="REF-Krishnamoothy-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Krishnamoothy 2001</LINK>). Wound healing normally follows a logical pattern, however, for many people this process is adversely influenced by a number of factors, for example, infection, poor blood supply or systemic disease (<LINK REF="REF-Tarnuzzer-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tarnuzzer 1996</LINK>). Wound healing potential is influenced by the perfusion of the affected area (<LINK REF="REF-Gottrup-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gottrup 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kosiak-1959" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kosiak 1959</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-LaVan-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">LaVan 1990</LINK>). Sustained unrelieved pressure causes vascular obstruction that eliminates capillary blood flow to an area (<LINK REF="REF-Kosiak-1959" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kosiak 1959</LINK>), causing oxygen and nutrient deprivation there (<LINK REF="REF-Husain-1953" TYPE="REFERENCE">Husain 1953</LINK>). Certain positioning techniques, for example 90-degree lateral rotation, which is used during bed rest, may exacerbate this situation and cause complete anoxia (lack of oxygen) to the weight-bearing area (<LINK REF="REF-Colin-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Colin 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sache-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sache 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Seiler-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Seiler 1986</LINK>). It is possible that a patient may be positioned directly onto a pressure ulcer - especially when multiple ulcers are present. If a patient with an existing pressure ulcer continues to lie or bear weight on the affected area, the tissues will be depleted of blood flow and will therefore remain without oxygen supply (<LINK REF="REF-Kosiak-1959" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kosiak 1959</LINK>). Depleted blood flow also means that the nutrients required for wound healing will not be made available to the wound and the removal of waste products from the wound will be impaired (<LINK REF="REF-Kosiak-1959" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kosiak 1959</LINK>). The overall result of this is that the wound will not heal and that, furthermore, the patient will be at risk of developing further tissue damage (<LINK REF="REF-Allman-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Allman 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Krapfl-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Krapfl 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>A fundamental way in which nurses and care staff may contribute to maximising the healing potential of existing pressure ulcers is by repositioning those patients who are unable to reposition themselves. International best practice advocates the use of repositioning as an integral component of a pressure ulcer prevention and management strategy. Although repositioning is advocated, there remains little scientific evidence upon which to base clinical decisions. Confusion exists regarding the frequency of turning required, with the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research, USA (<LINK REF="REF-AHCPR-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">AHCPR 1992</LINK>) advocating two-hourly turns, while the European Pressure Ulcer Advisory Panel &amp; National Pressure Ulcer Advisory Panel (<LINK REF="REF-EPUAP_x002f_NPUAP-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">EPUAP/NPUAP 2009</LINK>) and the National Institute for Clinical Evidence, UK (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2005</LINK>) advocate turning as required by the individual patient. Indeed, the Agency for Health Research and Quality, USA (<LINK REF="REF-AHCPR-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">AHCPR 1992</LINK>) acknowledges that whereas repositioning is a practice with good face validity, no well-designed controlled trials have examined its effect.</P>
<P>Overall, there is a lack of randomised controlled trial (RCT) evidence available. Repositioning continues to play a central role in the management of those individuals with existing pressure ulcers. Repositioning is not a novel concept, indeed it has been discussed in the literature for many decades and as far back as 1848, Robert Graves first described how pressure ulcers could be prevented, and managed more effectively, through the use of repositioning (<LINK REF="REF-Sebastian-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sebastian 2000</LINK>). It is interesting that even today the question of whether repositioning makes any difference to pressure ulcer healing has yet to be researched in a methodologically sound manner. However, despite this, repositioning continues to be advocated as part of pressure ulcer prevention and management strategies.</P>

<P>There is no randomised controlled trial (RCT) evidence that addresses the question of whether repositioning patients improves the healing rates of pressure ulcers. Although repositioning is a practice with good face value, there is no available RCT evidence to provide specific guidance for practice. Weight bearing directly onto an existing pressure ulcer will cause vascular obstruction which will eliminate capillary blood flow to the pressure ulcer. Therefore, it is reasonable to suggest that individuals with pressure ulcers are repositioned to avoid depriving the wounded area of oxygen and nutrients which are needed for tissue repair.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2009-02-10 17:31:39 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Repositioning is an integral component of pressure ulcer management strategies and is widely utilised in clinical practice. To date, there is no RCT evidence available to identify whether repositioning makes any difference to the healing rates of pressure ulcers. There is a need for a large cluster-randomised study, correctly powered, with treatment groups comparable at baseline, allocation to groups concealed, blinded outcome assessment and intention-to-treat analysis, to confirm the role of repositioning in the healing of pressure ulcers. Cluster randomisation involves the randomisation of units rather than individuals to the different arms of a study, for example units within a hospital, rather than individual patients (<LINK REF="REF-MRC-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">MRC 2002</LINK>). Cluster randomised trials are used for a number of reasons; increased efficiency, increased compliance with the study protocol and avoidance of contamination (<LINK REF="REF-Donner-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Donner 2004</LINK>). Contamination is said to occur when an intervention is given to an individual but may affect others within the trial (<LINK REF="REF-Puffer-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Puffer 2005</LINK>). For example, in a repositioning trial, care staff using a specific repositioning regime (e.g. the 30 degree tilt) may find it more practical to administer the intervention to all those who meet the inclusion criteria in a specific unit, rather than administer different repositioning regimes to different patients within the same unit.</P>
<P>Repositioning trials need to consider the effects of the following on the healing rates of pressure ulcers:</P>
<UL>
<LI>The effects of different repositioning regimes, for example, the 30 degree tilt versus the 90 degree lateral rotation.</LI>
<LI>The effects of different frequencies of repositioning, for example, 2 hourly turning, 3 hourly turning, 4 hourly turning etc.</LI>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">1.  Was the allocation sequence randomly generated?</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Low risk of bias</HEADING>
<P>The investigators describe a random component in the sequence generation process such as: referring to a random number table; using a computer random number generator; coin tossing; shuffling cards or envelopes; throwing dice; drawing of lots.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">High risk of bias</HEADING>
<P>The investigators describe a non-random component in the sequence generation process. Usually, the description would involve some systematic, non-random approach, for example: sequence generated by odd or even date of birth; sequence generated by some rule based on date (or day) of admission; sequence generated by some rule based on hospital or clinic record number.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Unclear</HEADING>
<P>Insufficient information about the sequence generation process to permit judgement of low or high risk of bias.</P>
</SUBSECTION>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">2.  Was the treatment allocation adequately concealed?</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Low risk of bias</HEADING>
<P>Participants and investigators enrolling participants could not foresee assignment because one of the following, or an equivalent method, was used to conceal allocation: central allocation (including telephone, web-based and pharmacy-controlled randomisation); sequentially-numbered drug containers of identical appearance; sequentially-numbered, opaque, sealed envelopes.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">High risk of bias</HEADING>
<P>Participants or investigators enrolling participants could possibly foresee assignments and thus introduce selection bias, such as allocation based on: using an open random allocation schedule (e.g. a list of random numbers); assignment envelopes were used without appropriate safeguards (e.g. if envelopes were unsealed or non opaque or not sequentially numbered); alternation or rotation; date of birth; case record number; any other explicitly unconcealed procedure.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Unclear</HEADING>
<P>Insufficient information to permit judgement of low or high risk of bias. This is usually the case if the method of concealment is not described or not described in sufficient detail to allow a definite judgement, for example if the use of assignment envelopes is described, but it remains unclear whether envelopes were sequentially numbered, opaque and sealed.</P>
