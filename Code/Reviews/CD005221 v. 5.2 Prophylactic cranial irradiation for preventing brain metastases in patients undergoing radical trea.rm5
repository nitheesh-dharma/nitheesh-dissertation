<P>Patients with non-small cell lung cancer have a significant risk of developing tumour spread (metastases) to the brain after potentially curative treatment. To date, four research trials have been published in full; they included different groups of patients who had different doses of radiotherapy, and different outcomes were measured. None of the trials showed that patients who had received prophylactic radiotherapy to the brain lived longer than those who had not, although fewer of them developed brain metastases. A fifth trial (<A HREF="RTOG 0214">RTOG 0214</A>) has not yet been published in full and is discussed in the results section.</P>

<P>Four RCTs have been included in this review. No further trials were found to be eligible in this update. Only one new trial investigating the role of PCI has been carried out since the original review and is only published in the abstract form (RTOG 0214) .

There is no evidence that any regimen is superior, and the effect of PCI on quality of life (QOL) is not known.</P>

<P>This update of the review published in 2005 does not contain any new trials published in full. One new trial that has only been published as an abstract, does not show any benefit in overall survival in patients receiving prophylactic cranial irradiation. There is insufficient evidence to support the use of PCI in clinical practice. Where possible, patients should be offered entry into a clinical trial.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2010-07-23 10:04:46 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Sera Tort">
<P>This review is an update of a previously published review in The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews Issue 2 2005 (<LINK REF="REF-Lester-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lester 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>Lung cancer is one of the commonest malignant tumours in developed countries, and is an increasing problem in developing countries (<LINK REF="REF-Boyle-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boyle 2000</LINK>). Between 75% and 85% of patients will have non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) (squamous cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, large cell carcinoma, undifferentiated carcinoma), and 10% to 20% of these will be potentially curable. Following potentially curative treatment for NSCLC, the brain is a site of first relapse in 6.8% to 19% of cases and the risk of brain metastases is influenced by histological type and tumour stage (<LINK REF="REF-LCSG-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">LCSG 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Perez-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Perez 1987</LINK>). Brain metastases are more common in patients with adenocarcinoma or large cell carcinoma, and in those with locally advanced disease. Brain metastases impair quality of life, and survival is poor (<LINK REF="REF-Nussbaum-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nussbaum 1996</LINK>). The benefit of prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) in small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is well established. At three years, survival is increased by 5.4%, and the cumulative rate of brain metastases reduced by 25.3% in those patients achieving complete remission with chemotherapy (<LINK REF="REF-PCIOCG-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">PCIOCG 2000</LINK>). Despite the relatively high incidence of brain metastases in NSCLC, the role of PCI in patients treated with radical intent has not been established.</P>

<P>In the first publication of the review (<LINK REF="REF-Lester-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lester 2005</LINK>) the literature search identified four RCTs comparing PCI with observation in NSCLC patients treated with radical intent. All four trials met the inclusion criteria and were included in the review (<A HREF="http://archie.cochrane.org/sections/documents/view?version=7764D03B82E26AA2004E1C6E59AB05F3&amp;format=REVMAN#STD-VALG#STD-VALG">VALG</A>; <A HREF="http://archie.cochrane.org/sections/documents/view?version=7764D03B82E26AA2004E1C6E59AB05F3&amp;format=REVMAN#STD-SWOG#STD-SWOG">SWOG</A> ; <A HREF="http://archie.cochrane.org/sections/documents/view?version=7764D03B82E26AA2004E1C6E59AB05F3&amp;format=REVMAN#STD-RTOG-84_x002d_03#STD-RTOG-84_x002d_03">RTOG 84-03</A>; <A HREF="http://archie.cochrane.org/sections/documents/view?version=7764D03B82E26AA2004E1C6E59AB05F3&amp;format=REVMAN#STD-Umsawasdi-1984#STD-Umsawasdi-1984">Umsawasdi 1984</A>).</P>
<P>The update of the bibliographic search identified 377 unique references. Of those only one new trial was identified since the original review and is only published in the abstract form (<LINK REF="STD-RTOG-0214" TYPE="STUDY">RTOG 0214</LINK>). As it is only published as an abstract it cannot be included in this review formally as we are unable to assess the risk of bias. However, as it is an important trial it will be described in this section. Another trial (<LINK REF="STD-Pottgen-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Pottgen 2007</LINK>) was excluded because it was not randomised.</P>
<INCLUDED_STUDIES_DESCR MODIFIED="2010-07-29 05:51:46 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Sera Tort">
<P>The studies included slightly different patient groups. All four trials required histological confirmation of the diagnosis. Three trials (<LINK REF="STD-VALG" TYPE="STUDY">VALG</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-RTOG-84_x002d_03" TYPE="STUDY">RTOG 84-03</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Umsawasdi-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Umsawasdi 1984</LINK>) required a normal radionuclide brain scan or CT head prior to randomisation. The VALG trial randomised 410 evaluable male patients not considered suitable for surgical resection with no evidence of metastases and no spread beyond the regional nodes. Details of disease stage were not given. Eighty-seven patients were excluded with reasons given, leaving 323 evaluable patients. RTOG 84-03 randomised 187 patients with inoperable or unresectable adenocarcinoma or large cell carcinoma confined to the chest and resected carcinomas of the same cell types. There were no exclusions. Over 80% of patients had node-positive disease. Umsawasdi included patients with locally advanced NSCLC of any cell type. One hundred patients were randomised. There were three exclusions with reasons given, leaving 97 evaluable patients. Of these, 84/97 (87%) were stage III and 13/94 (13%) stage I to II. The SWOG study randomised 254 patients with inoperable stage III NSCLC and a Karnofsky performance status of &gt;60. Twenty-eight patients were excluded with reasons given, leaving 226 evaluable cases.</P>
<P>Therefore, a total of 951 patients were randomised in these RCTs, of whom 833 were evaluable and reported. The VALG study included 42 patients with small cell lung cancer and these have been excluded for the purposes of this review, leaving 791 patients in total.</P>
<P>Thoracic treatment differed between the trials. The VALG study randomised patients to one of two radical RT regimens; 50 Gy in 25 fractions over 5 weeks or 42 Gy in 15 fractions over 3 weeks. In RTOG 84-03, patients having primary RT received 55-60 Gy in 30 fractions over 6 weeks or 50 Gy in 25 fractions over 5 weeks to the mediastinum and hilar areas following surgical resection. The thoracic treatment received in the Umsawasdi trial was not clearly stated for all patients. Sixty-three patients received radical chemoradiotherapy (thoracic RT dose 50 Gy in 25 fractions over 5 weeks), the details of which were described in a subsequent publication (<LINK REF="REF-Umsawasdi-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Umsawasdi 1987</LINK>). Thirty-four patients received differing combinations of surgery, RT and chemotherapy given with curative intent. In the SWOG trial, patients were first randomised to either chest RT (58 Gy in 29 fractions) or neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by chest RT and adjuvant chemotherapy. In all four trials, patients were randomised to PCI or observation irrespective of thoracic response to treatment.</P>
<P>In two trials (RTOG 84-03; Umsawasdi 1984), PCI patients received 30 Gy in 10 fractions over 2 weeks. In the VALG trial, patients received 20 Gy in 10 fractions over 2 weeks. In the SWOG trial, the first 34 patients received 37.5 Gy in 15 fractions, but this was changed to 30 Gy in 15 fractions soon after the trial began recruiting due to concerns about early deaths in the PCI arm.</P>
<P>The studies measured and reported similar outcomes. All four trials reported incidence of brain metastases and survival. Two trials (VALG; Umsawasdi 1984) reported time to brain metastases. The RTOG trial (<LINK REF="STD-RTOG-84_x002d_03" TYPE="STUDY">RTOG 84-03</LINK>) reported on the prevalence of brain metastases at 12 and 24 months.</P>
<P>Quality of life assessments were not carried out in any of the studies.</P>
<P>One trial (VALG) did not report on PCI-related toxicity. Two trials reported on late complications of PCI (<LINK REF="STD-RTOG-84_x002d_03" TYPE="STUDY">RTOG 84-03</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Umsawasdi-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Umsawasdi 1984</LINK>) and one trial (<LINK REF="STD-RTOG-84_x002d_03" TYPE="STUDY">RTOG 84-03</LINK>) on acute toxicity. The SWOG trial reported RT toxicity but did not define this further.</P>
<P>Detailed information on the follow-up protocol was provided in two trials (<LINK REF="STD-VALG" TYPE="STUDY">VALG</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-RTOG-84_x002d_03" TYPE="STUDY">RTOG 84-03</LINK>). No study required regular imaging of the head as part of follow up. Three trials (<LINK REF="STD-VALG" TYPE="STUDY">VALG</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-RTOG-84_x002d_03" TYPE="STUDY">RTOG 84-03</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Umsawasdi-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Umsawasdi 1984</LINK>) required a CT head or radionuclide scan if intracranial metastases were suspected for any reason.

<P>
<LINK REF="STD-RTOG-0214" TYPE="STUDY">RTOG 0214</LINK> aimed to recruit 1058 patients with Stage III disease following loco-regional treatment and randomise to PCI or observation. Due to slow accrual only 356 patients were recruited and the trial was stopped early. The results show that there is no difference in overall survival or disease free survival in the PCI group compared to the observation arm. However, CNS metastatic rate at 1 year was statistically different with CNS relapse 7.7% vs 18% for PCI vs observation. The trial aims to analyse the impact of PCI on neuropsychological function and QoL.</P>
<P>It is clear that the four published studies were heterogenous in patient selection, thoracic treatment, PCI dose, and the way in which key outcome measures were assessed and reported. Meta-analysis of the data was therefore inappropriate, and only a narrative synthesis was performed.</P>

<B>Incidence of brain metastases<BR/>
</B>
</I>PCI did significantly reduce the incidence of brain metastases in three trials (<LINK REF="STD-VALG" TYPE="STUDY">VALG</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-SWOG" TYPE="STUDY">SWOG</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Umsawasdi-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Umsawasdi 1984</LINK>). In the <LINK REF="STD-VALG" TYPE="STUDY">VALG</LINK> study, the two thoracic RT schedules used were combined for statistical analysis. The incidence of brain metastases was significantly lower in the PCI arm compared to the observation arm (6% vs 13%, P=0.038, Fisher's exact test). The only specific cell type in which PCI was significantly more effective in reducing the incidence of brain metastases was adenocarcinoma ( 0% vs 29%, P=0.04). In the Umsawasdi trial the incidence of brain metastases in the PCI arm was 4% compared to 27% in the observation arm (P=0.02, chi-squared). In the same trial, multivariate analysis suggested the beneficial effect of PCI was only significant in females, patients with a good performance status, weight loss less than 6%, squamous histology and stage III disease. This analysis should be interpreted with caution, as only 97 patients in total were evaluable, and sample sizes may have been too small to reliably detect differences. In the <LINK REF="STD-SWOG" TYPE="STUDY">SWOG</LINK> trial the incidence of brain metastases in the PCI arm was 1% compared to 11% in the observation arm (P=0.003, chi-squared).</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-RTOG-84_x002d_03" TYPE="STUDY">RTOG 84-03</LINK>, PCI did not significantly reduce the incidence of brain metastases compared to the observation arm (9% vs 19%, P=0.10, chi-squared). A subgroup analysis on the 26 patients who had surgical resection of gross intrathoracic disease followed by mediastinal RT showed PCI did not significantly reduce the incidence of brain metastases (0% vs 25%, P=0.06). The effect of PCI on the incidence of brain metastases in the 161 patients receiving primary thoracic RT was also not significant (10% vs 18%, P=0.34), but in both groups results favoured PCI.</P>

</I>In the <LINK REF="STD-VALG" TYPE="STUDY">VALG</LINK> trial, the median time to development of brain metastases was 34 weeks in the PCI group and 29 weeks in the observation group. The statistical significance of this result was not stated. In the Umsawasdi trial, PCI was also reported to significantly prolong the median time to central nervous system metastases (50.5 weeks vs 23 weeks, P=0.002, Cox's regression model). The prevalence of brain metastases at 12 and 24 months for PCI versus observation in <LINK REF="STD-RTOG-84_x002d_03" TYPE="STUDY">RTOG 84-03</LINK> was not significant (15% vs 17% and 15% vs 31%, P=0.10, log rank test).</P>

The median survival figures for PCI versus observation in the <LINK REF="STD-VALG" TYPE="STUDY">VALG</LINK> trial were 35.4 weeks vs 41.4 weeks (P=0.5, Gehan-Wilcoxon test), and in <LINK REF="STD-RTOG-84_x002d_03" TYPE="STUDY">RTOG 84-03</LINK>, 8.4 months vs 8.1 months (P=0.36, log rank test). In the <LINK REF="STD-SWOG" TYPE="STUDY">SWOG</LINK> trial, median survival was lower in the PCI arm (8 months vs 11 months, P=0.004, log rank test). In the Umsawasdi trial, three-year survival in the PCI and control groups were 22% and 23.5% respectively. No statistical analysis of the survival data was reported. In <LINK REF="STD-RTOG-84_x002d_03" TYPE="STUDY">RTOG 84-03</LINK>, there was no significant difference between PCI and observation in one and two-year survival (40% vs 44% and 13% vs 21%, P=0.36, log rank test). </P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2010-07-11 19:38:57 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Brain metastases impair quality of life and are associated with a poor prognosis (<LINK REF="REF-Nussbaum-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nussbaum 1996</LINK>). The rationale behind PCI is to control or eradicate undetectable micrometastases before they become clinically significant without inducing severe adverse effects. The first objective of the review was to establish whether PCI prevents the development of brain metastases and increases survival in NSCLC patients treated with curative intent. The four trials identified were relatively small, heterogenous in patient selection, thoracic treatment and PCI dose, and this should be considered when interpreting the review. In addition, the overall quality of the trials is low, with only one having adequate allocation concealment.</P>
<P>Three of the four trials did show a significant reduction in the incidence of brain metastases with PCI (<LINK REF="STD-VALG" TYPE="STUDY">VALG</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-SWOG" TYPE="STUDY">SWOG</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Umsawasdi-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Umsawasdi 1984</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-RTOG-84_x002d_03" TYPE="STUDY">RTOG 84-03</LINK> did not, but with less than 100 patients in each arm it was possible the trial was too small to detect any clinically relevant difference, and the results still favoured PCI.</P>
<P>Two trials (<LINK REF="STD-VALG" TYPE="STUDY">VALG</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-RTOG-84_x002d_03" TYPE="STUDY">RTOG 84-03</LINK>) reported no significant difference in overall survival between the PCI and control arms. The Umsawasdi trial did not publish statistical analysis of the survival data, but three-year survival in the PCI and control arms were very similar (22% vs 23.5%). Only the <LINK REF="STD-SWOG" TYPE="STUDY">SWOG</LINK> trial showed a significantly reduced median survival with PCI. Unlike the other trials, the <LINK REF="STD-SWOG" TYPE="STUDY">SWOG</LINK> trial did give PCI concurrently with thoracic RT, and it may be that the subsequent increased toxicity contributed to the reduced survival. The data presented suggested that PCI may reduce the incidence of brain metastases but this did not lead to a survival advantage. The lack of survival advantage with PCI was not necessarily surprising, however. In all four trials, the majority of patients received RT to the chest as primary treatment, and local control with this modality was only in the region of 50% (<LINK REF="REF-Perez-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Perez 1987</LINK>).</P>
<P>Response to thoracic treatment was not a requirement in any of the four trials, and patients with uncontrolled thoracic disease would have been unlikely to benefit from PCI. In addition, the thoracic RT dose used in all four trials would not be considered radical by modern standards; higher doses may improve local control, prolong survival, and allow any survival benefit with PCI to be manifest. Finally, any patients in whom brain micrometastases were controlled or eradicated with PCI would almost inevitably have relapsed at other sites because brain metastases are strongly associated with disseminated disease (<LINK REF="REF-Cox-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cox 1979</LINK>). The lack of survival advantage may therefore reflect the presence of uncontrolled disease in the chest or at other metastatic sites outside of the brain.</P>
<P>The experience with PCI in SCLC is also worth considering. Several RCTs suggested a reduction in the incidence of brain metastases with PCI, but no convincing improvement in survival. As a consequence, PCI was not considered a standard of care in SCLC. A subsequent meta-analysis of seven RCTs (987 patients) did however, demonstrate a small but significant absolute increase in three-year survival of 5.4% (P=0.01) with PCI (<LINK REF="REF-PCIOCG-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">PCIOCG 2000</LINK>). It was not logical to extrapolate these results to NSCLC patients as SCLC is a more radiosensitive diease with a higher incidence of brain metastases, but it may be that a large enough RCT would demonstrate a survival advantage not seen in the relatively small trials reported to date.</P>
<P>In order to minimise the number of patients treated unnecessarily, it would be beneficial to identify a high risk population which might benefit from PCI. Studies have suggested brain metastases occur in a higher proportion of patients with adenocarcinoma or large cell carcinoma (<LINK REF="REF-LCSG-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">LCSG 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Perez-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Perez 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Salbeck-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Salbeck 1990</LINK>) and it would be expected that any benefit from PCI would be more pronounced in patients with these histological subtypes. Indeed, the <LINK REF="STD-VALG" TYPE="STUDY">VALG</LINK> trial showed PCI had a significant effect on reducing the incidence of brain metastases only in patients with adenocarcinoma. The other two trials did not support this hypothesis however. The <LINK REF="STD-RTOG-84_x002d_03" TYPE="STUDY">RTOG 84-03</LINK> trial only included patients with adenocarcinoma or large cell carcinoma and did not demonstrate a significant benefit with PCI. The Umsawasdi trial showed that only for patients with squamous histology did PCI significantly reduce the incidence of brain metastases. This may however have been a chance finding from subgroup analysis on small samples.</P>
<P>The incidence of brain metastases depends on the initial disease stage. Salbeck et al (<LINK REF="REF-Salbeck-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Salbeck 1990</LINK>) reported no cases of brain metastases on initial CT staging in patients with stage I and II NSCLC. In the same study, CT scanning detected brain metastases in 17.5% of patients thought to have stage III disease, and the rate of brain metastases as a first site of relapse in stage III disease was reported to be as high as 30% at four years (<LINK REF="REF-Stuschke-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stuschke 1999</LINK>). It would seem PCI might be more beneficial in stage III as opposed to early stage disease, but only in the Umsawasdi trial did multivariate analysis suggest a significant beneficial effect in stage III disease compared to stages I and II. Therefore it was not possible using results from the trials included in this review to identify a high risk group which may derive proportionally more benefit from PCI. Again, the number of patients in each trial was relatively small, and a larger RCT would help in establishing the patients at greater risk of brain metastases.</P>
<P>The second objective was to establish the most effective regimen of radiotherapy. The three trials that showed a significant reduction in the incidence of brain metastases with PCI used different regimens. The Umsawasdi trial used 30 Gy in ten fractions over two weeks and the <LINK REF="STD-VALG" TYPE="STUDY">VALG</LINK> trial 20 Gy in ten fractions over two weeks. The <LINK REF="STD-SWOG" TYPE="STUDY">SWOG</LINK> trial used 37.5 Gy in 15 fractions for the first 34 patients and 30 Gy in 15 fractions for the remaining 77 patients; there was no significant difference in median survival between the two PCI regimens used. The differences in inclusion criteria made any comparison between the trials inappropriate. In addition, no randomised trial had compared these (or any other) PCI regimens head-to-head, so it was not possible to say whether one was more effective.</P>
<P>None of the studies included in this review collected detailed prospective data on the long-term effects of PCI on neuropsychological function. Hopefully <LINK REF="STD-RTOG-0214" TYPE="STUDY">RTOG 0214</LINK> will provide this information once it is published in full. In the meta-analysis of PCI in SCLC (<LINK REF="REF-Auperin-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Auperin 1999</LINK>), two trials evaluated the effect of PCI on neuropsychological function (<LINK REF="REF-Arriagada-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Arriagada 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gregor-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gregor 1997</LINK>). In the French trial, patients in the PCI group received 24 Gy in 8 fractions over 12 days. There were no significant differences between patients receiving PCI and those in the observation group in terms of neuropsychological function. In the Gregor trial, the majority of patients randomised to PCI received 30Gy in ten fractions over two weeks. In both groups, there was an impairment of cognitive function and QOL before PCI, and further impairment at 6 and 12 months, but no additional impairment in the PCI group compared to the control group. The trials in this review does not provide substantial information on treatment-related toxicity, but is reasonable to assume any effect on function with a given PCI regimen would be the similar in SCLC and NSCLC patients. It is probable, therefore, that both 30Gy in 10 fractions over 2 weeks and 30Gy in 10 fractions over 2 weeks cause little significant brain damage for the first one to two years following PCI, but longer term follow up data is needed to fully assess late toxicity.</P>

<P>This update confirms that there is still insufficient evidence to support the use of PCI in the management of patients with NSCLC treated with curative intent. The trials do demonstrate a potential benefit of PCI, but this evidence is weak and possibly biased. The design and conduct of a proper RCT should also take into account this methodological weakness and avoid or reduce them appropriately.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2010-05-16 20:12:11 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>All trials showed a reduction in the incidence of brain metastases in patients receiving PCI, and there is enough evidence to suggest a large RCT would be justified. More prospective research on the long-term effect of PCI on cognitive function and quality of life is needed, and hopefully <LINK REF="STD-RTOG-0214" TYPE="STUDY">RTOG 0214</LINK> will provide this information once it is published in full. The patient population most likely to benefit is not clear, nor is the most beneficial radiotherapy schedule. More homogenous entry criteria in future randomised trials would facilitate meta-analysis. The failure of <LINK REF="STD-RTOG-0214" TYPE="STUDY">RTOG 0214</LINK> to recruit the planned 1000 patients indicates that this question may not ever be fully answered.<BR/>
