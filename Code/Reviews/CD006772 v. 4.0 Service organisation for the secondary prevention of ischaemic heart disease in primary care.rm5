<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2010-01-07 12:51:07 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Ischaemic heart disease is the term used for conditions caused by a narrowing of the arteries that supply blood to the heart muscle. Patients may have angina, or may have had a previous myocardial infarction (heart attack) or surgery to widen or bypass the affected arteries. "Secondary prevention" is the term used to describe health care that aims to prevent further events or the worsening of such conditions in these patients.</P>
<P>Research has been done to try to find the best way to organise health care so that people with heart disease benefit most from lifestyle changes and medications that are known to help to reduce the risk of heart disease getting worse.</P>
<P>This research suggests that careful changes in the way health care and advice are provided may increase the proportion of patients whose total cholesterol levels and blood pressure are within target levels, but the evidence is weak. No evidence was found that suggested similar changes can help to reduce other risk factors or improve the prescribing of medicines that can prevent further disease. The changes that appear to be more effective include regular planned appointments with a clinician, careful monitoring of medications and risk factors (such as blood pressure, cholesterol and lifestyle), and education for patients to raise awareness of the importance of secondary prevention.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2009-06-11 15:46:23 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Joey Kwong">
<P>Ischaemic heart disease (IHD) is a major cause of mortality and morbidity and its prevalence is set to increase. Secondary prevention aims to prevent subsequent acute events in people with established IHD. While the benefits of individual medical and lifestyle interventions is established, the effectiveness of interventions which seek to improve the way secondary preventive care is delivered in primary care or community settings is less so.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2010-01-11 11:55:01 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>To assess the effectiveness of service organisation interventions, identifying which types and elements of service change are associated with most improvement in clinician and patient adherence to secondary prevention recommendations relating to risk factor levels and monitoring (blood pressure, cholesterol and lifestyle factors such as diet, exercise, smoking and obesity) and appropriate prophylactic medication.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2010-02-01 13:05:54 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, <I>The Cochrane Library</I> 2007, Issue 4), MEDLINE (1966 to Feb 2008), EMBASE (1980 to Feb 2008), and CINAHL (1981 to Feb 2008). Bibliographies were checked. No language restrictions were applied.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2010-02-01 11:08:59 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Joey Kwong">
<P>Eleven studies involving 12,074 people with IHD were included. Increased proportions of patients with total cholesterol levels within recommended levels at 12 months, OR 1.90 (1.04 to 3.48), were associated with interventions that included regular planned appointments, patient education and structured monitoring of medication and risk factors, but significant heterogeneity was apparent. Results relating to blood pressure within target levels bordered on statistical significance. There were no significant effects of interventions on mean blood pressure or cholesterol levels, prescribing, smoking status or body mass index. Few data were available on the effect on diet. There was some suggestion of a "ceiling effect" whereby interventions have a diminishing beneficial effect once certain levels of risk factor management are reached.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2010-02-01 11:08:59 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Joey Kwong">
<P>There is weak evidence that regular planned recall of patients for appointments, structured monitoring of risk factors and prescribing, and education for patients can be effective in increasing the proportions of patients within target levels for cholesterol control and blood pressure. Further research in this area would benefit from greater standardisation of the outcomes measured.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Ischaemic heart disease - burden of disease</HEADING>
<P>Ischaemic heart disease (IHD) is a major cause of mortality and morbidity and is a growing problem: worldwide it is estimated that some 50 million people have existing IHD (<LINK REF="REF-Neal-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Neal 2004</LINK>) with a one in four (25%) risk of suffering a further serious event in the next 10 years (<LINK REF="REF-Law-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Law 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2002</LINK>). Although in recent decades IHD mortality rates have fallen in many developed countries, rates of morbidity are increasing as a result of improved diagnosis and more successful treatment of acute illness which, for example, has led to an increasing number of survivors of myocardial infarction (<LINK REF="REF-HDA-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">HDA 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Law-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Law 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Neal-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Neal 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NSF-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">NSF 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-SIGN-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">SIGN 2000</LINK>). Another major factor affecting increased prevalence of IHD morbidity is the growing elderly population in many countries. Age plays a major role in IHD: the prevalence of angina in particular rises sharply with age (<LINK REF="REF-Task-Force-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Task Force 1997</LINK>); the incidence of myocardial infarction also increases with age and varies between geographical regions (<LINK REF="REF-HDA-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">HDA 2000</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Secondary prevention of IHD</HEADING>
<P>The primary prevention of IHD is desirable and is considered to be most appropriately targeted in the first instance at those considered to be at a high risk of developing IHD because of combinations of risk factors - including smoking, raised blood pressure and serum cholesterol levels, family history of IHD, obesity and diabetes (<LINK REF="REF-De-Backer-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">De Backer 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wood-1998a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wood 1998a</LINK>). However, multi-factorial interventions aimed at primary prevention and delivered at individual patient level appear to offer only modest benefit in terms of risk factor reduction, so that their clinical- and cost-effectiveness is still a matter for debate (<LINK REF="REF-Ebrahim-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ebrahim 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>Secondary prevention (the prevention of further acute IHD events amongst those with established IHD) is more easily targeted, is widely advocated and is considered a priority in countries with high prevalence of IHD (<LINK REF="REF-DoHC-Ireland-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">DoHC Ireland 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-HDA-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">HDA 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moher-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NSF-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">NSF 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-SIGN-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">SIGN 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wood-1998a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wood 1998a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wood-1998b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wood 1998b</LINK>). Secondary prevention of IHD potentially comprises both patient- and clinician-centred activities aimed at reducing risk of further IHD events through effective management of modifiable clinical risk factors:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>patient education and motivation in relation to healthy lifestyle choices - smoking cessation, healthy diet and regular exercise;</LI>
<LI>effective monitoring of patients' risk and prophylactic use of appropriate medications - antiplatelets, beta blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, statins, angiotensin II receptor blockers, calcium channel blockers (<LINK REF="REF-De-Backer-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">De Backer 2003</LINK>).</LI>
</UL>
<P>In a recent meta-analysis, secondary preventive programmes that include risk factor education or counselling and structured exercise were associated with a significantly reduced risk of subsequent acute myocardial infarction (0.62 (CI 0.44 to 0.87)). Programmes including risk factor education or counselling but no exercise component were associated with a significantly reduced risk of mortality (risk ratio, 0.87 (CI 0.76 to 0.99)). Programmes that are purely exercise-based were associated with a significantly reduced risk of mortality (risk ratio, 0.72 (CI, 0.54 to 0.95)). Most programmes were associated with small improvements in quality of life and functional status (<LINK REF="REF-Clark-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clark 2005</LINK>). Broader interventions focusing on wider lifestyle modification, risk factor monitoring and management and prophylactic medication have shown some improvements in health status and in terms of levels of risk factor monitoring and prescribing (<LINK REF="STD-Campbell-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Campbell 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kiessling-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Kiessling 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Munoz-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Munoz 2007</LINK>). However, questions regarding the optimal design, frequency and duration of interventions remain unanswered (<LINK REF="REF-McAlister-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">McAlister 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>Whilst the effectiveness of secondary preventive measures is in little doubt, their use has been found to be suboptimal (<LINK REF="REF-Bowker-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bowker 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Brady-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brady 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Campbell-1998a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Campbell 1998a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Campbell-1998b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Campbell 1998b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Campbell-1998c" TYPE="REFERENCE">Campbell 1998c</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Carroll-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carroll 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cupples-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cupples 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cupples-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cupples 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Flanagan-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Flanagan 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jolly-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jolly 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moher-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moher-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ramsay-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ramsay 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Williams-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Williams 2003</LINK>). Guideline recommended treatments and secondary prevention programmes have been found to be underused in women and older people with IHD, whilst those in lower socioeconomic strata have been found to be more likely to have angina but less likely to consult their doctor (<LINK REF="REF-Buckley-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Buckley 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Murphy-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Murphy 2006</LINK>). Compared with those who have had an acute myocardial infarction, patients with angina alone appear less likely to receive appropriate secondary preventive care (<LINK REF="REF-Buckley-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Buckley 2008</LINK>). Poor detection and management of hypercholesterolaemia has been detected in IHD patients (<LINK REF="REF-Hickling-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hickling 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>Although the content and aims of evidence-based guidelines on the secondary prevention of IHD are supported by the majority of primary care physicians, only a minority of such physicians believe they are being implemented successfully. The reasons for this are multi-factorial and are believed to include lack of clinician time, poor patient compliance and the cost of prophylactic prescriptions (<LINK REF="REF-Hickling-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hickling 2005</LINK>). Uncertainty regarding best practice in the delivery of secondary preventive care can only serve to perpetuate this situation. Interventions to improve the uptake and implementation of practice guidelines in diverse clinical areas have included individual and workshop outreach education for clinicians and the involvement of clinical opinion leaders and many of these interventions have improved practice to some extent, although in general the effect has been small (<LINK REF="REF-Doumit-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Doumit 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Forsetlund-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Forsetlund 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hobbs-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hobbs 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Majumdar-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Majumdar 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Brien-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Brien 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>With the aim of informing practical and achievable planning in primary care/community settings, this review is focused purely on interventions that alter the way existing service in primary care or community settings are organised with outcomes being patient and clinician adherence to the recommendations of secondary preventive practice guidelines.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Service organisation interventions</HEADING>
<P>For the purposes of the review, a service organisation intervention for the secondary prevention of IHD is defined as an intervention which comprises a systematic change, or changes, in the organisation of existing care provision targeting at least one of the following:</P>
<P>a) improved levels of appropriate and available secondary preventive medication and risk factor monitoring</P>
<P>b) improved patient adherence to medication</P>
<P>c) improved patient adherence to secondary prevention recommendations relating to modifiable lifestyle factors.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Primary care/community settings</HEADING>
<P>In countries in which the term is in use, primary care is the setting in which most IHD is first detected and where its long term management is conducted. In many other countries, even those in which most diagnosis of IHD may take place in secondary care settings, long term management of IHD is conducted in community settings with occasional referral to specialist services.</P>
<P>Primary care is described by Starfield as "that level of a health service system that provides&#8230; person focused care over time&#8230; Primary care addresses the most common problems in the community by providing preventive, curative and rehabilitative services to maximize health and well being. It integrates care when there is more than one health problem and deals with the context in which illness exists and influences the responses of people to their health problems. It is care &#8230; directed at promoting, maintaining, and improving health" (<LINK REF="REF-Starfield-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Starfield 1998</LINK>). By such definition primary care is ideally suited to the long-term healthcare interventions which are needed to deliver secondary prevention of IHD at community level.</P>
<P>In countries in which the term is in use, primary care is widely understood as referring to those multidisciplinary health services which provide the first point of access to healthcare services, are designed to maintain a long term relationship with the patients, families and communities and are based primarily in units of varying size and function within the community rather than in hospitals. Primary care is not, however, a term which is in use universally and so in this review the term "community settings" is also used to highlight the fact that studies conducted in countries in which primary care is not a commonly used term need not be excluded.</P>
<P>A systematic review will best be able to inform practice in primary care if it considers evidence generated within - or at least principally within - primary care which relates to populations that are broadly representative of the primary care IHD population. There has been some debate about whether study populations identified in secondary and tertiary care settings are representative of the community population of people with IHD as defined in this review. It has been argued, for example, that populations identified in secondary and tertiary care settings for angina studies have been disproportionately white and male, mostly with previous acute myocardial infarction or coronary artery bypass graft or percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty at a time when angina is increasingly diagnosed in primary care in the absence of such co-morbidity (<LINK REF="REF-Timmis-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Timmis 2007</LINK>); and that participants in a high-profile randomised controlled trial, which heavily influenced the British Hypertension Society's guidelines for the management of blood pressure in post-stroke patients, were more likely to be male, younger and hypertensive than the general practice population of patients with previous stroke (<LINK REF="REF-Mant-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mant 2006</LINK>). <B>

<P>For the purposes of this review, programmes have been considered to have been delivered in primary care (or community settings) if they have been delivered in contexts which fulfil the definition of primary care established by the Committee on the Future of Primary Care at the Institute of Medicine in the United States:</P>
<P>"Primary care is the provision of integrated, accessible healthcare services by clinicians who are accountable for addressing a large majority of personal healthcare needs, developing a sustained partnership with patients, and practicing in the context of family and community" (<LINK REF="REF-Donaldson-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Donaldson 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>Primary care clinicians are defined as "an individual who uses a recognized scientific knowledge base and has the authority to direct the provision of personal health services to patients" and are "generally considered to be physicians, nurse practitioners and physician assistants" and "a broader array of individuals in a primary care team" (<LINK REF="REF-Donaldson-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Donaldson 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>In the context of cardiovascular care, the primary care team may include community-based physicians such as general practitioners and family physicians, community pharmacists, practice nurses, community and public health nurses and other professions allied to medicine such as dieticians, occupational therapists and physiotherapists.</P>

<LI>Studies have been included in the review if the interventions have been delivered principally in primary care or community settings by either primary care clinicians or clinicians whose normal roles are in other areas within health systems - including secondary care (e.g. community hospitals) and tertiary care (e.g. general hospitals, medical centres and teaching hospitals) - but who have worked in a primary care context for the purposes of the programme's delivery.</LI>
<LI>Studies from countries where the primary care model is not standard have been included if the studied care is delivered by clinicians whose practice is accessible, involves ongoing and long-term relationships with patients and provides for a wide range of healthcare needs.</LI>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Comparators</HEADING>
<P>In the included studies, the comparators are "normal care". Yet in different health services and regions baseline levels of secondary preventive care may differ markedly. Comparison of the effectiveness of interventions in countries with different levels of development may be methodologically uncertain: the effectiveness of interventions may be affected by both the baseline levels of secondary preventive care provision and by differing levels of underlying deficiencies in health, access to health services, education, standards of living and opportunity for healthy lifestyle. Baseline levels of provision have been described in the review where appropriate in order to inform interpretation and implementation of the results. Where visual inspection of plots detects substantial heterogeneity, sensitivity analysis has been used as appropriate to consider the effect on outcomes of differing baseline service provision.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Selection of studies</HEADING>
<P>Searching as per strategy identified 3396 titles. On review by the authors, 65 of them appeared from title or abstract to meet the inclusion criteria. Consideration of full text reports resulted in 49 of these being excluded for reasons specified in <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_EXCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of excluded studies</LINK>. Most commonly, papers were excluded because of lack of randomisation or short study duration or because the outcomes reported were not those considered by this review.</P>
<P>As anticipated at the protocol writing stage, we found heterogeneity in study settings, methods and intervention types. In addition, differing health systems and concepts of general practice, primary care, family or community medicine in different countries resulted in challenges with regard to determining which studies might be included and which excluded. With these challenges in mind we endeavoured to state a priori definitions of concepts such as "service organisation intervention" and "primary care setting". This caution proved well-founded. Whilst many dozens of studies appeared from their abstracts to be potentially eligible for inclusion, this number reduced dramatically when we applied the definitions for eligible interventions and settings upon inspection of full text reports.</P>
<P>Service organisation interventions were defined as interventions which comprise systematic changes in existing care provision aimed at improved adherence with recommendations on secondary prevention of IHD. Emphasis was placed on the principle that no additional services or therapies should be provided to the patient - that any improved secondary prevention might be attributed to the organisation of the services and therapies already available. Many studies were excluded because the interventions clearly involved the introduction of treatment or service elements for IHD patients which were entirely additional to existing services rather than changes in the way pre-existing services were delivered or organised. An example is the provision of professionally supervised exercise programmes in patients' homes.</P>
<P>A great many studies, although ostensibly primary care based, considered secondary or tertiary care outreach interventions rather than interventions aimed at reorganisation or improvement of existing primary care. These were often studies based in hospital out-patient contexts, or in the community but conducted by hospital-based staff without significant liaison with existing primary care or community health services. In locations where well developed primary care or community medicine systems were in place, such interventions were excluded. Conversely, there were a number of studies set in locations where primary care or community medicine systems are not in place and where health services are primarily hospital-based. In these circumstances trials of interventions conducted by secondary or tertiary care clinicians were included provided they did not introduce therapies or services which were not previously available to patients who sought them and provided they sought to influence secondary prevention long after patients left the acute setting and returned to the community.</P>

Study populations ranged from 58% male to 85% male with mean ages ranging from 62.0 to 68.8 years. Only one study was set outside Europe.

<P>Five studies were conducted in England, two in Ireland (one in Northern Ireland and one in both Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland), one in China, one in Spain, one in Scotland and one in Sweden. Further details of the studies and interventions are presented in this section.</P>
<P>Our search strategy identified the protocol of the <LINK REF="STD-SPHERE" TYPE="STUDY">SPHERE</LINK> study and the study was completed in October 2007, prior to the search date. The Heart Group advised that the study could be included and the investigators provided the data for the review. The study report has since been published (<LINK REF="STD-SPHERE" TYPE="STUDY">SPHERE</LINK>).</P>
<P>We received additional data and information about studies from the authors of five studies (<LINK REF="STD-Cupples-1994a" TYPE="STUDY">Cupples 1994a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kiessling-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Kiessling 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Munoz-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Munoz 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-SHIP-1999" TYPE="STUDY">SHIP 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-SPHERE" TYPE="STUDY">SPHERE</LINK>). Attempts to contact Chinese trialists for supplementary data failed.</P>
<P>The eligible studies identified involved considerable variation in both the outcomes measured and the elements of the interventions. We considered the elements of the interventions carefully and categorised them. Each study could then be considered in terms of the elements involved in the interventions which were additional to normal care in order to facilitate consideration of those elements which are most often associated with improved outcomes.</P>
<P>Elements of interventions additional to normal care which were identified were as follows:</P>
<OL>
<LI>Structured monitoring and assessment of risk factors and medications</LI>
<LI>Preplanned appointment/s / patient recall</LI>
<LI>Patient education or awareness raising regarding secondary prevention: risk factors, medications and lifestyle</LI>
<LI>Clinician education or awareness raising regarding secondary prevention: promotion of clinical guidelines, clinical management advice, education or training</LI>
<LI>Improved secondary/primary care interface</LI>
<LI>Information technology based decision supports</LI>
<LI>Nurse proactive in care management</LI>
<LI>Pharmacist proactive in care management</LI>
</OL>
<P>Planned monitoring and assessment of risk factors and medications were central elements in many of the study interventions. Three studies featured risk factor and medication monitoring by doctors or nurses or both (<LINK REF="STD-Campbell-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Campbell 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gao-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Gao 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-SPHERE" TYPE="STUDY">SPHERE</LINK>). One of the studies focused on the review by community pharmacists of prescribing to IHD patients, with recommendations being sent to the patients' general practitioners (GPs). This study included patients with angina, previous acute myocardial infarction and revascularisation and in addition to medication, patients' compliance, lifestyle and social issues were also assessed, with patients recalled by the pharmacist as they felt necessary for effective monitoring (<LINK REF="STD-Bond-2007b" TYPE="STUDY">Bond 2007b</LINK>). Pre-planned appointments for patients to see clinicians was a feature of many of the interventions: in some studies these appointments followed discharge following an acute admission or hospital clinic attendance (<LINK REF="STD-Gao-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Gao 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-SHIP-1999" TYPE="STUDY">SHIP 1999</LINK>); in others the patients were selected randomly from a prevalent practice population of people with IHD (SPHEREa); in still others entire practice populations were invited to participate (<LINK REF="STD-Bond-2007b" TYPE="STUDY">Bond 2007b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Campbell-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Campbell 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cupples-1994a" TYPE="STUDY">Cupples 1994a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moher-2001a-_x0028_GP-led_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Moher 2001a (GP led)</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moher-2001b-_x0028_nurse-led_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Moher 2001b (nurse led)</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Munoz-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Munoz 2007</LINK>). Several interventions included the provision to patients of secondary preventive advice and education about risk factors, lifestyle and medication (<LINK REF="STD-Campbell-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Campbell 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cupples-1994a" TYPE="STUDY">Cupples 1994a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Feder-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Feder 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gao-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Gao 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-SPHERE" TYPE="STUDY">SPHERE</LINK>). In other interventions education or training was aimed at clinicians: in some this involved direct training or educational meetings aimed at raising standards in the provision of secondary preventive care, while in others the focus was on raising the awareness of secondary prevention guidelines (<LINK REF="STD-Eccles-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Eccles 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Feder-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Feder 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kiessling-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Kiessling 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moher-2001a-_x0028_GP-led_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Moher 2001a (GP led)</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moher-2001b-_x0028_nurse-led_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Moher 2001b (nurse led)</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Munoz-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Munoz 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-SHIP-1999" TYPE="STUDY">SHIP 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-SPHERE" TYPE="STUDY">SPHERE</LINK>). Two study interventions involved efforts to ensure a smooth transition for patients from hospital-based care to primary care following discharge (<LINK REF="STD-Gao-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Gao 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-SHIP-1999" TYPE="STUDY">SHIP 1999</LINK>) and one featured a computer-based decision support system aimed at improving secondary prevention (<LINK REF="STD-Eccles-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Eccles 2002</LINK>). Some interventions were principally led by or focused upon doctors (<LINK REF="STD-Eccles-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Eccles 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Feder-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Feder 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gao-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Gao 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kiessling-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Kiessling 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moher-2001a-_x0028_GP-led_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Moher 2001a (GP led)</LINK>), nurses (<LINK REF="STD-Campbell-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Campbell 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cupples-1994a" TYPE="STUDY">Cupples 1994a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moher-2001b-_x0028_nurse-led_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Moher 2001b (nurse led)</LINK>), community pharmacists (<LINK REF="STD-Bond-2007b" TYPE="STUDY">Bond 2007b</LINK>) or both nurses and doctors (<LINK REF="STD-SHIP-1999" TYPE="STUDY">SHIP 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-SPHERE" TYPE="STUDY">SPHERE</LINK>). One study contained three arms, including one which was doctor-centred and one nurse-centred: the first arm comprised simply an audit of secondary preventive care in practices, followed by normal care and is considered as the control for the purposes of analysis in this review; the second arm comprised audit, creation of a register of patients with IHD and routine recall to appointments with the GP; the third comprised audit, creation of an IHD register and recall to nurse-led IHD clinics (<LINK REF="STD-Moher-2001a-_x0028_GP-led_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Moher 2001a (GP led)</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moher-2001b-_x0028_nurse-led_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Moher 2001b (nurse led)</LINK>). This was considered as two studies and we split the data from the normal care arm to avoid double-counting.</P>
<P>As discussed, the delivery of health care is organised in many different ways around the world and "primary care" exists as neither a term nor a concept in some. Yet we considered it essential that studies should not be excluded for reasons of semantics or health system differences. One Chinese study, reported in Mandarin, was considered at length and translated twice. We included it because although it was led by hospital-based physicians, this was representative of the manner in which health care was normally available to the participants and communities involved. Both the normal care and the intervention arms involved both hospital and community-based health care (<LINK REF="STD-Gao-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Gao 2007</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Heterogeneity</HEADING>
<P>We identified several potential sources of heterogeneity a priori<I> </I>and implemented strategies such as careful definition of terms and sensitivity analysis to alleviate their effects and enable quantitative meta-analysis. However, additional sources of heterogeneity emerged that further compromised meta-analysis. The outcome measures set for the review were improved patient and clinician adherence to internationally accepted recommendations for the secondary prevention of IHD (<LINK REF="REF-De-Backer-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">De Backer 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wood-1998a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wood 1998a</LINK>). These recommendations provide target levels for scale risk factor measurements such as blood pressure, cholesterol and body mass index (BMI) and categorical indicators of appropriate secondary preventive care such as prescribing of prophylactic medications and smoking cessation. Given these well-defined and widely accepted measurements of successful secondary preventive care, the wide variation in trial outcome measurements was surprising and reduced the opportunities for meta analysis.</P>
<P>Few trials measured the same outcomes. More surprising and problematic, there was frequent deviation from accepted target levels for risk factors. Some deviation resulted from changes in the accepted levels through time, but some could not be explained. For example, thresholds used for determination of hypertension were variously set at 140/90 mmHg (<LINK REF="REF-De-Backer-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">De Backer 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gao-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Gao 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wood-1998a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wood 1998a</LINK>), 160/90 mmHg (<LINK REF="STD-Campbell-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Campbell 1998</LINK>), 160/100 mmHg (<LINK REF="STD-Moher-2001a-_x0028_GP-led_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Moher 2001a (GP led)</LINK>), and 140/85 mmHg (<LINK REF="STD-Bond-2007b" TYPE="STUDY">Bond 2007b</LINK>). The way in which outcomes were recorded varied: in some trials the numbers of those prescribed medications were recorded, in others those "prescribed, not in need of the drug or contraindicated". In some "known smokers" were recorded, in others "known non-smokers", leaving an indeterminate subgroup whose status was unknown. Some trials recorded numbers of patients with BMI &lt;25 kg/m2, others reported mean BMI. Some studies devised outcomes which were intended to indicate whether certain risk factors were "adequately" or "appropriately" assessed or managed, but the standards by which adequacy was judged varied (<LINK REF="STD-Bond-2007b" TYPE="STUDY">Bond 2007b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Campbell-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Campbell 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moher-2001a-_x0028_GP-led_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Moher 2001a (GP led)</LINK>).</P>
<P>Despite cooperation of many trial researchers, data that could be pooled were not available in many cases. They had not been collected. Compounding this problem was the range of follow-up periods, with six studies following participants for 12 months, two for 18 months, two for 24 months and one for 36 months. Consequently, given the variation in reported outcomes and follow-up times, data could be pooled for relatively few outcomes. Methods of reporting results, the diverse nature of the data collected and the relatively small numbers of studies that could be pooled meant that subgroup analysis was not viable.</P>
<P>Given the inevitable heterogeneity in trials of service organisational interventions, we gave the issue careful consideration at each analysis. We used random effects models in meta-analyses where the I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic, visual inspection of the forest plots and consideration of study populations, interventions and settings suggested high levels of heterogeneity.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Individual and cluster randomisation</HEADING>
<P>Seven of the included studies were randomised at cluster level (<LINK REF="STD-Eccles-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Eccles 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Feder-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Feder 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kiessling-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Kiessling 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moher-2001a-_x0028_GP-led_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Moher 2001a (GP led)</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moher-2001b-_x0028_nurse-led_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Moher 2001b (nurse led)</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Munoz-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Munoz 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-SHIP-1999" TYPE="STUDY">SHIP 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-SPHERE" TYPE="STUDY">SPHERE</LINK>) and the rest used individual randomisation. In order that the data from cluster and individually randomised trials could be combined, we calculated effective sample sizes for the cluster-randomised trial using the approach described in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Review of Interventions. Using the mean cluster size for each trial and intracluster correlation coefficients, effective sample sizes were calculated which accounted for the cluster design effect. Some studies calculated and reported intracluster correlation coefficients (<LINK REF="STD-Eccles-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Eccles 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Feder-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Feder 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-SPHERE" TYPE="STUDY">SPHERE</LINK>): these ranged from 0.045 to 0.062 and given the similarity in populations and settings an approximate middle value intracluster correlation coefficient of 0.05 was used for those that did not.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Strategy for evidence synthesis</HEADING>
<P>Multidimensional heterogeneity in interventions, settings, populations and baseline care levels were thus compounded by variations in outcome measurements and length of follow up. In such circumstances it can be argued that meta-analysis is inappropriate. Nevertheless meta-analyses were possible for several comparisons and in many cases showed some consistency in effect across studies.</P>
<P>The ultimate purpose of the review is to help to inform the development of secondary prevention in primary care. In order to fulfill this purpose as effectively as possible, meta-analyses were conducted where possible and are reported, supplemented by narrative consideration of what the evidence suggests about the interventions and their settings, why interventions have the effect they do (or do not), and of relationships between studies.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Blood pressure within recommended level</HEADING>
<P>Three studies comparing service organisation interventions with normal care reported data for 3126 participants on blood pressure within the study target level at 12 months (<LINK REF="STD-Bond-2007b" TYPE="STUDY">Bond 2007b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Campbell-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Campbell 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gao-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Gao 2007</LINK>). When data were pooled the association between service interventions and blood pressure within recommended levels bordered upon statistical significance, with a combined OR of 1.77 (95% CI 1.00 to 3.16) (<LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>). However, there was a high degree of heterogeneity in this analysis in terms of study populations, interventions and settings as well as in effect size: one study was a UK pharmacist led intervention amongst people with all forms of IHD included in this review (OR 1.05 (95% CI 0.84 to 1.30)) (<LINK REF="STD-Bond-2007b" TYPE="STUDY">Bond 2007b</LINK>), one a UK nurse led intervention amongst people with angina or previous acute myocardial infarction (OR 1.78 (95% CI 1.35 to 2.34) (<LINK REF="STD-Campbell-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Campbell 1998</LINK>) and the third a physician led intervention amongst people with previous coronary artery bypass graft in China (OR 3.62 (95% CI 1.97 to 6.66)) (<LINK REF="STD-Gao-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Gao 2007</LINK>). The Chinese trial, which had the most significant effect, included only post coronary artery bypass graft patients, who may have been more easily motivated by structured and sustained secondary preventive care than those who had not undergone such major surgery and were included in other trials (<LINK REF="STD-Gao-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Gao 2007</LINK>). In addition, methods of randomisation and allocation concealment were uncertain in this trial. In both analyses there was no statistically significant effect when this trial was removed. Each of the three trials in the 12 month analysis had in common routine planned recall of patients for appointments and structured monitoring of risk factors and medications. Two of the three also included secondary prevention patient lifestyle education (<LINK REF="STD-Campbell-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Campbell 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gao-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Gao 2007</LINK>), two included secondary prevention training or awareness-raising initiatives for clinicians (<LINK REF="STD-Bond-2007b" TYPE="STUDY">Bond 2007b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Campbell-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Campbell 1998</LINK>) and one included improved secondary/primary care interface (<LINK REF="STD-Gao-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Gao 2007</LINK>).

There was a significant association between the interventions and total cholesterol levels within recommended levels at 12 months, with an OR of 1.90 (1.04 to 3.48), with the Campbell study being associated with the greatest improvement, with an OR of 2.48 (1.93 to 3.18). There was no significant intervention effect when the three were combined. All three interventions included structured monitoring of risk factors and medication, planned regular recall of patients and patient lifestyle education. Two of the three also included secondary prevention training or awareness-raising initiatives for clinicians (<LINK REF="STD-Campbell-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Campbell 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-SPHERE" TYPE="STUDY">SPHERE</LINK>). There was a high level of heterogeneity in the included studies. One included only post coronary artery bypass graft patients, one angina and post acute myocardial infarction patients, and one all categories of IHD patients. In addition, the trial which contributed most to the significant pooled result is considerably older than the other two, so that baseline levels of cholesterol compliance in primary care populations may have been lower and therefore easier to improve upon (<LINK REF="STD-Campbell-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Campbell 1998</LINK>).</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2010-02-01 11:08:59 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Joey Kwong">
<P>There was inevitably considerable heterogeneity in studies included in this review of complex interventions in complex healthcare settings. However, identification of sources of heterogneity a priori and development of strategies to address these, identification of hetergeneity in meta-analyses and the use of random-effects models meant that some pooling was possible. However, although included studies were generally of good quality, results of meta-analyses undertaken in a context where heterogeneity and complexity are prevalent must be interpreted with caution. The generalisability of the results of the review is uncertain as the populations included in the trials were predominantly men with mean age ranging from 62.0 to 68.8 years in European countries.</P>
<P>There was some weak evidence that beneficial effects in terms of the number of patients whose cholesterol and blood pressure levels were within target levels are associated with primary care interventions that include preplanned recall of patients, systematic monitoring of risk factors and medication, patient education or awareness-raising in relation to secondary prevention and to a lesser degree clinician education or awareness-raising in relation to secondary prevention recommendations. Only a meta-analysis of two very different trials measuring cholesterol levels within target levels at 12 months showed true statistical significance, whilst a meta-analysis of three trials measuring blood pressure within target levels bordered on significance. However, there was considerable heterogeneity in the trials included in both these analyses. No significant intervention effects were detected relating to mean blood pressure or cholesterol levels. Little evidence was found that could shed light on whether such interventions also offer benefit in relation to other lifestyle-centred risk factor outcomes such as diet, obesity and smoking. One trial showed a significant association between such an intervention and maintaining a low fat diet (<LINK REF="STD-Campbell-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Campbell 1998</LINK>). There was little evidence to suggest that service organisational interventions are associated with improved outcomes in the prescribing of prophylactic medications.</P>
<P>A "ceiling effect", whereby it becomes more difficult to show benefits once a certain baseline level of treatment has been reached, has been discussed in the context of diabetes care (<LINK REF="REF-Davies-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davies 2008</LINK>) and there is some evidence from the included studies that suggest this may be the case in the secondary prevention of IHD, although it must be acknowledged that this is a post hoc analysis. For example, when prescribing of antiplatelets was considered, senstivity analysis showed that when older trials, conducted in the 1990s, were considered together, there was a significant intervention effect on prescribing (<LINK REF="STD-Campbell-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Campbell 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moher-2001a-_x0028_GP-led_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Moher 2001a (GP led)</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moher-2001b-_x0028_nurse-led_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Moher 2001b (nurse led)</LINK>), whilst those conducted since 2000 had little effect. The lack of significant effect of these interventions on prescribing behaviours may not relate to their inherent ineffectiveness, but to more aggressive and effective targeting of prophylaxis in Europe in the years since the Recommendations of the Second Joint Task Force of European and other Societies on Coronary Prevention (<LINK REF="REF-Wood-1998a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wood 1998a</LINK>). A similar temporal effect may have contributed to the significant intervention effect on cholesterol levels within study targets: the trial which contributed most to the effect dated from the early 1990s, when baseline cholesterol levels were higher and more easily improved (<LINK REF="STD-Campbell-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Campbell 1998</LINK>). The diminishing returns associated with a "ceiling effect" may be seen also in the blood pressure analysis, in which the Chinese trial has a much greater effect than any other. This may relate to a difference in the trial population, which included only post-coronary artery bypass graft patients who may be more easily motivated than others by structures and sustained secondary preventive care, but it may also reflect the effect of the introduction in the intervention group of a structured care model in a healthcare system where normal care for the control group included no regular recall or structured risk-factor monitoring (<LINK REF="STD-Gao-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Gao 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>It remains difficult to say which elements of service organisation interventions have most effect on outcomes. There were not enough trials included in meta-analyses for sensitivity analysis to be able to detect which elements of interventions were associated with most benefit. It is true that, in this review, significant beneficial effect was associated with interventions which included patient and clinician education or awareness-raising in relation to secondary prevention recommendations, preplanned recall of patients and systematic monitoring of risk factors and medication. However, this is not to say that other elements may not be as important, simply that evidence for their effectiveness has not been detected. The data included in this review relate to interventions whose principal service providers have been doctors, nurses and community pharmacists working both closely with other primary care professionals and relatively independently. However, there were insufficient studies or data to suggest that the effectiveness of interventions is affected by the type of primary care professional that leads.</P>

<P>There is limited evidence that interventions centred on alterations in the way secondary prevention is provided in the primary care context can be effective in improving patient compliance with recommendations on blood cholesterol and blood pressure levels. The interventions associated with these improved outcomes included patient secondary prevention education or awareness-raising, preplanned recall of patients and systematic monitoring of risk factors and medication.</P>
<P>Once secondary preventive care reaches certain levels it may become more difficult for interventions to achieve further benefit. Service organisation interventions aimed at improved secondary preventive care for people with IHD should be implemented in regions and populations where current secondary preventive care does not follow a structured and sustained model.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2010-02-01 11:09:00 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Joey Kwong">
<P>Trials of complex interventions in primary care aimed at improved secondary prevention of IHD should focus on patient lifestyle-related outcomes. However, there needs to be greater co-operation between researchers in different countries to ensure standardisation of the outcomes measured in such studies if systematic reviewing is to be effective in evaluating and describing the evidence base. Given that there may be a "ceiling effect", whereby it is hard to detect benefit of secondary preventive measures in the whole IHD population once a certain baseline level of prescribing has been reached, it may be useful to conduct research in populations at higher risk of subsequent IHD events. Previous research has highlighted the fact that, while clinicians are supportive of secondary prevention guidelines, considerable barriers exist that affect implementation. Other research methods such as qualitative studies may be of use in identifying a new testable hypothesis of how this gap could be closed.</P>

<P>The term "primary care" has been added to the title to make more explicit the scope of the review. </P>
<P>It became clear during the study selection phase that some thought had to be given to length of follow up. The nature of the interventions meant that they were often lengthy and ongoing in nature. The length of follow up was hard to determine in some cases in that the activities or elements of care which constituted the intervention could not easily be withdrawn from patients or the education or guidelines provided to clinicians could not be undone. Thus the authors determined that a twelve month "length of study" would be acceptable as minimum "length of follow up".</P>

<P>The design of the study meant that although the study as a whole lasted several years, the length of follow up of the same patient groups lasted less than 12 months. The intervention (provision of guideline summaries and practice performance feedback) was delivered in the summers of 1999, 2000 and 2001. Prescribing was recorded in subsequent Jan-Mar data collections in 2000, 2001 and 2002. For each of the data collections, practice-based populations of IHD patients were identified as anyone with recorded IHD attendance or treatment in the three year periods preceding. Although many patients may have been common to each of the practice-based populations in each year, details are not reported.</P>
