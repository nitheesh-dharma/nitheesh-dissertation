<P>Stroke is a common disorder. It is due either to blockage of an artery in the brain or to bleeding in the brain. Chuanxiong is a Traditional Chinese Medicine. It is widely used in China for the treatment of patients with stroke. Two poor quality trials involving 161 participants were included in this review. The authors did not find any strong evidence about its effects. Well-designed and conducted trials will be needed to provide reliable evidence to show whether this intervention does more good than harm.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Generality and epidemiology</HEADING>
<P>Stroke, a generic term for a variety of vascular disorders accounting for neurologic deficits, includes ischemic strokes and hemorrhagic stroke (<LINK REF="REF-Yatsu-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yatsu 1987</LINK>). Eighty-eight per cent of all strokes are ischemic, the remaining 12% are hemorrhagic strokes (<LINK REF="REF-AHA-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">AHA 2006</LINK>). Stroke continues to be a major public health concern, with more than 750,000 new strokes occurring each year in the United States, and American adults have a higher prevalence of stroke than their European counterparts according to a study presented at the American Stroke Association's International Stroke Conference 2008. Stroke is the third leading cause of death and the first leading cause of serious, long-term disability in the United States (<LINK REF="REF-ASA-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">ASA 2004</LINK>). Incidence and death rate for stroke are higher among blacks than whites in the United States, approximately similar rates affect men and women, and there is a strikingly higher incidence (20 to 30 per 1000) for those over 75 years of age (<LINK REF="REF-Goldman-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goldman 2000</LINK>). Optimal treatment of the patient who has an acute ischemic stroke requires rapid assessment and early intervention. The most promising treatment are clot-busting drugs, for example tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA), which must be administered within a three-hour window from the onset of symptoms (<LINK REF="REF-ASA-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">ASA 2004</LINK>). Antiplatelet therapy, with drugs such as aspirin, has shown to reduce the risk of recurrent stroke, myocardial infarction and vascular death in patients with a history of stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) by about 15% to 20% (<LINK REF="REF-Algra-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Algra 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-APT-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">APT 1994</LINK>). A systematic review of the randomised trials of thrombolytic therapy has shown there are some risks of intracranial hemorrhage (<LINK REF="REF-Wardlaw-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wardlaw 2002</LINK>). A survey of treatments used in routine practice in China showed that 75% of doctors surveyed believed that Chinese herb products were effective treatments for acute ischemic stroke, and 66% of doctors used them routinely for most patients (<LINK REF="REF-Chen-1997a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chen 1997a</LINK>)</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">The constituents and functions of chuanxiong</HEADING>
<P>The common name for chuanxiong is Chuanxiong rhizome, or Szechuan lovage root; the botanical name is Liqusticum Chuanxiong Hort, and the pharmaceutical name is Rhizoma Ligustici Wallichii. The root of this plant is used as medicine (<LINK REF="REF-Chen-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chen 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Chen-1997b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chen 1997b</LINK>). It is frequently used together with Chinese angelica root, and other herbs are added based on the syndromes. There are three alkaloids separated from the plant: tetramethylpyrazine (TMP or ligustrazine), leucylphenylalanine anhydride, and perlolyrine. This herb also includes several essential components including conidium-lactone and ligustilide (<LINK REF="REF-Wang-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wang 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wei-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">
Wei 1994
</LINK>
; 
<LINK REF="REF-Xu-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Xu 2003</LINK>). In Traditional Chinese Medicine, the functions of chuanxiong are promoting blood circulation and relieving pain (<LINK REF="REF-Chen-1997b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chen 1997b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Guo-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guo 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wang-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wang 1989</LINK>), enhancing the immune system, and anti-inflammatory (<LINK REF="REF-Sinclair-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sinclair 1998</LINK>). It effectively prohibits the platelet aggregation and activation in ischemic tissue; maintains the balance of thromboxane A2/prostacyclin I2 (TXA2/PGI2) in blood; decreases the permeability of blood vessels, the viscosity of blood and hematocrit (HCT); prohibits the synthesis and release of DynorphinA1-13 (DynA1-13) (which is an immune substance); increases the activity of intrinsic superoxide dismutase (SOD) and so on (<LINK REF="REF-Ge-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ge 1994</LINK>). Chuanxiong could improve brain microcirculation through preventing thrombus formation and platelet aggregation and blood viscosity (<LINK REF="REF-Chen-1992a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chen 1992a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sun-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sun 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wang-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wang 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wei-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">

; 
<LINK REF="REF-Xu-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Xu 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zhang-2001a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhang 2001a</LINK>) so that it might have significant beneficial effects in the treatment of ischemic stroke.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">The usage of chuanxiong</HEADING>
<P>The water extraction of chuanxiong can be taken orally or by injections. After oral administration it is quickly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and distributed widely in the liver, gall bladder, intestine, brain and kidneys, with the highest density in the liver (<LINK REF="REF-Sun-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sun 2002</LINK>). The peak effects are observed within one to three hours (<LINK REF="REF-Guo-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guo 2001</LINK>). It has a short half-life because of the rapid metabolism in the liver (<LINK REF="REF-Ye-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ye 1996</LINK>), and the metabolites are excreted mainly in urine and a little in the bile (<LINK REF="REF-Sun-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sun 2002</LINK>). When used together with other Chinese herbs the common dosage is 3 to 9 g (<LINK REF="REF-Wang-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wang 1989</LINK>). Ligustrazine, which is isolated from chuanxiong, is one of the most active ingredients used widely for treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Ye-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ye 1996</LINK>). When treating ischemic stroke, ligustrazine injections should be used for 10 to 14 days. The daily dose of ligustrazine is 80 to 160 mg, diluted in 250 to 500 ml solution with 5% to 10% isotonic saline or glucose for intravenous infusion, based on the phase I trial in which three groups of patients with acute ischemic cerebrovascular disease (ICVD) were treated with different dosages of ligustrazine; large dose ligustrazine is good for improving clinical effect and hemorheology (<LINK REF="REF-Cai-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cai 2000</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">The side effects of chuanxiong</HEADING>
<P>A few comparisons regarding toxicity between chuanxiong and other drugs are reported (<LINK REF="REF-Ge-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ge 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Xu-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Xu 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zhang-2001a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhang 2001a</LINK>) and drug-related adverse events occur occasionally. In the clinical use of chuanxiong, it is reported to occasionally cause severe hypotension (<LINK REF="REF-Zhang-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhang 2002</LINK>), allergic reactions (<LINK REF="REF-Sun-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sun 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wu-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wu 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zhu-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhu 2001</LINK>) or drug-induced fever (<LINK REF="REF-Ge-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ge 1994</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Rationale for undertaking this review</HEADING>
<P>Hundreds of clinical studies of the benefits and side effects of chuanxiong treatment and other drugs for acute ischemic stroke have been carried out. However, poor quality and inadequate methodology were common problems with these studies. We therefore performed this systematic review of the evidence on the benefits and harms of chuanxiong for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Studies identified</HEADING>
<P>The electronic and hand searches identified 63 studies of chuanxiong for acute ischemic stroke. After screening the full publications, we excluded nine of these studies due to the lack of control groups. We excluded another nine studies that did not assess the patients in the acute phase of ischemic stroke. Of the remaining 45 possible RCTs retrieved for further assessment, four studies were confirmed to be truly randomised trials but we excluded two trials that compared chuanxiong with an active drug. We also excluded 30 studies, which after interview, had not used an appropriate randomised method of treatment allocation. The other 11 studies are currently awaiting assessment as we were unable to contact the authors. Finally, two trials were deemed eligible for inclusion in the review (<LINK REF="STD-Fan-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Fan 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wang-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2006</LINK>).</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Efficacy of Chuanxiong for acute ischemic stroke</HEADING>
<P>Since all the included trials in this systematic review evaluated the efficacy of chuanxiong immediately at the end of the treatment period, we could not draw any conclusion about its long-term effect. However, there is no reliable evidence about the short term effect either, since both included trials are of low quality. Despite small differences (even if conventionally statistically significant) between treatment and control, there is no clear indication of benefit on the important outcome measures. It is possible that any apparent beneficial effects observed are merely due to poor methods and bias. Furthermore, mortality rate, death or dependency of patients are important measurements of the therapy for acute ischemic stroke patients, but neither of the included trials assessed these issues. Both of the included trials observed the clinical efficacy of chuanxiong and classified the outcomes into: basic cure; significant improvement; improvement; no improvement and deterioration, and it seemed that the chuanxiong group had better outcomes than the control group. However, these outcome measures are yet to be validated for sensitivity and reliability. We also found that some of the other trials assessed the efficacy of chuanxiong by the outcome measures which are of no clinical significance, such as hemorheology changes and blood biochemical parameters. In short, the trials in this review failed to evaluate the efficacy of chuanxiong for acute ischemic stroke by appropriate measurements. Therefore, we could not draw any conclusion about the efficacy of chuanxiong for acute ischemic stroke from the two low quality trials.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Safety of chuanxiong for acute ischemic stroke</HEADING>
<P>One trial (<LINK REF="STD-Wang-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2006</LINK>) reported secondary hemorrhage after cerebral infarction, which necessitated withdrawal of ligustrazine (chuanxiong) and aspirin. Elevation of AST, which turned out to be normal in two weeks without additional therapy, was described in the same trial. But neither trial showed significant differences between the two treatment methods, and these adverse effects were considered to be connected with the severity of the stroke itself. The other trial did not report any adverse effects during the trial (<LINK REF="STD-Fan-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Fan 2003</LINK>). It should be pointed out that both trials only assessed this issue during the short period of the trials, which might be not long enough to assess the safety of chuanxiong.</P>
<P>Although a definite conclusion regarding safety cannot be drawn from this review due to the limited evidence provided by the included trials, chuanxiong may be safe for acute ischemic stroke. To better assess the safety of chuanxiong, large-scale clinical trials with long-term follow up are required.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Limitations</HEADING>
<P>In this review, the poor design and low methodological quality of the included studies affected our conclusion. None of the trials used a placebo as control, instead 'active drugs' were selected in some excluded trials. For example: <LINK REF="STD-Wang-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2003</LINK> compared ligustrazine (chuanxiong) injection with troxerutin, and <LINK REF="STD-Wu-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Wu 2007</LINK> compared chuanxiong with vinpocetine. This may result in false positive findings and would not assess the efficacy of a treatment accurately.<BR/>
<BR/>All of the studies identified were published in Chinese, facilitating our telephone contact with most of the trial authors about the method of randomisation. Although a large number of the trials claimed to be RCTs, we found that most of the authors misunderstood the concept of randomisation and as a result, most of the studies were excluded due to incorrect randomisation. In addition to this, some of the studies were conducted several years ago, and the authors had forgotten the details of the methodology they used. This could lead to a memory bias and undermine the veracity of the information. Besides, none of the trials used double blinding or concealment of allocation. These limitations may have resulted in a high risk of selection bias</P>
<P>Some of the excluded trials (<LINK REF="STD-Fu-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Fu 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Liu-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Liu 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tian-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Tian 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wan-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Wan 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wei-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Wei 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wu-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Wu 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yang-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Yang 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yang-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Yang 2002</LINK>) used unequal groups in their design. Of these trials, one used a proportion of two treatment) to one control, which means 70 participants were included in the treatment group, but only 36 participants were included in the control group (<LINK REF="STD-Liu-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Liu 2004</LINK>). Consideration of the sample sizes was not reported in these trials, which make it difficult to accurately detect the differences between the two groups. This may lead to a low test power.</P>
<P>We found that some of the trials used self-produced chuanxiong preparations for treating acute ischemic stroke. Although Chinese herbal medicine as a treatment for diseases and the methods of manufacture are widely accepted in China, many of the constituents of the pharmacologically prepared drugs used in trials cannot be clearly specified. This is quite different to the pharmacological agents used in Western medicine, in which the chemical constituents, their quantities, the percentage of any impurities or contaminants are precisely known and the variation between different production batches is kept within specified limits; variation between formulations and batches of pharmacological agents are inevitable in traditional Chinese medicine. Though the Chinese Government specifies the acceptable limits of variation, this variation presents a factor that may contribute to heterogeneity between different study results, so the quality of herbs and methods of preparation should be stated in detail in the trials.</P>
<P>None of the trials in this review mentioned ethical issues and informed consent. However, for clinical trial and other health-related matters, these two key issues are important to protect participants' rights and benefits. All clinical trials should be approved by relevant ethics committees and trialists are legally and ethically obliged to make sure every human being of adult years and sound mind has the right to decide what shall be done with his own body. Unfortunately, we found that most of the Chinese trialists did not consider these issues, which must be addressed in future studies.</P>
<P>Finally, we found that in testing the neurological functional deficit scores, the results in the two studies appeared to give different standard deviations; this inconsistency may reflect a potential for detection bias.</P>

<P>We found no strong evidence on which to base any clinical recommendations. In the two small, poor quality trials included in the review, the evidence is insufficient to suggest whether chuanxiong is a safe and effective therapy for acute ischemic stroke patients or not.

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2008-07-08 09:35:29 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>Further research should pay more attention to the methodology of trials. Randomisation, blinding, compliance assessment, similarity of comparison groups at baseline, sample size calculation, time to follow up, and appropriateness of the statistical analysis are important factors for a high-quality trial.<BR/>
<BR/>For acute ischemic stroke, a disease accounting for neurological deficits, more attention should be paid to the choice of meaningful measurements for patients and international indicators such as mortality, dependency, the Barthel Index, and the modified Rankin Scale, which would evaluate the efficacy of the therapy more accurately. At the same time, the follow-up period should be long enough to assess the long-term efficacy and safety of the treatment. In addition, quality of life, adverse effects and economic evaluation should be appraised in the study.<BR/>
