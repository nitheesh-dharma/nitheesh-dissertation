I have added the NNT results to the abstract as MECIR requests relative and absolute reporting of results in the abstract. Ready for copy editing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2014/01/13&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CJC revisited to look at peer review comments. You have contrasted the studies with and without exercise in the subgroup analysis of the primary outcomes, and could highlight the statistically significant benefits seen in the studies without exercise. There is no significant difference between subgroups as you point out, but when self-management is considered without excercise the trials show significant benefit (which answers the peer reviewers worry that the effects are really due to the exercise bit).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In my view the MD in SGRQ is clinically relevant as it is close to 4 units and larger than the MD for tiotropium!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chris&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-------------------------------------------&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CJC reviewed following change in primary analysis to be RCTs only. I think this holds together much better now, but you need to change the summary of findings tables to match the abstract and the new primary results please. Also the footnotes for the SoF are missing (to indicate why each downgrade was made). Please add these too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Best wishes,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chris&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marlies' reply on Emma's notes are added in italic 15/10/2013&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emma W notes 23/08/2013&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Great review update - thanks for your changes in response to my earlier comments. I copied and pasted the background under the recommended headings - please check. A few small things to change:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abstract - rather than have the text in parentheses &amp;quot;(of which six had no usual care control group)&amp;quot;, can you instead add a sentence to say that 23 studies compared self-man to usual care and 6 were head-to-head.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;We have added the sentence:&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;&amp;quot;Twenty three of these studies compared self-management to usual care while six studies compared different components of self-management head-to-head.&amp;quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;methods - unit of analysis issues. I added a statement - you will need to describe how you handled the cluster randomised trials here too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The cluster randomised trial you refer to is the study of Rea et al. This study was also included in the previous update, and in the meta-analyses it was handled as an RCT. We did not change the numbers used for this study in our previous update. In this update we have used the same approach. However, we have noticed now that the Cochrane handbook recommends to correct the values for intra-cluster correlation by using an intra-cluster correlation coefficient. Would you recommend us to do this? If yes, could you advise us on which ICC we should use?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;included studies - round up/down the numbers calculated for percentages&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;We have rounded the numbers calculated for percentages in the &amp;quot;included studies&amp;quot; section.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm confused because you talk about 'studies with usual care' and 'studies without usual care'. Does this mean 'self-management versus usual care' and 'self-management verus a different self-managment program'? The former you were able to pool, but to make it clearer for the reader, I think I would state that you were unable to pool the head-to-head trials at the top of the 'effects of interventions section, just to make it really clear. I presume this is due to heterogeneity within the control groups?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;In order to clarify the difference between studies with and without usual care, we have added the following passage to the manuscript:&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;&amp;quot;As stated earlier, 23 studies compared self-management to usual care and six studies compared different components of self-management head-to-head. The latter studies are referred to as &amp;quot;studies without usual care&amp;quot; in the section below. Due to heterogeneity in the interventions, we were not able to pool the studies without a usual care control group in meta-analyses, therefore the results of these studies are only described qualitatively.&amp;quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;can you re-order the results like the outcomes - I did this in the forest plots already&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;We have re-ordered the results like the outcomes. Since the secondary outcomes were originally not hierarchically ordered, I changed the order there somewhat so that the results read more logical. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Discussion - can you try to write under the headings inserted. I have copied and pasted it for you already.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;We have tried to re-order the discussion under the recommended headings, however we could not use all the headings since some of the headings are incorporated in the text and we could not isolate the text without tearing it from its context. Hopefully, this will suffice. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;20/8/13 - Emma J notes - initial ed check&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1) You've referenced GOLD 2010, but the current guidelines are GOLD 2013 (Feb). Do you need to amend your ref? And please add a date accessed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;At time of defining the in- and exclusion criteria for the update of this review, GOLD 2010 were the most current guidelines and these are the guidelines we used. Therefore, we believe it is appropriate to refer to GOLD 2010 instead of 2013.We have added a date accessed.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2) Please see PLEACS standards for your plain language summary - http://www.editorial-unit.cochrane.org/sites/editorial-unit.cochrane.org/files/uploads/PLEACS_0.pdf. (Click on 'set of minimum standards').&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;We have studied the PLEACS standards for plain language summary, and adapted the plain language summary to meet the standards. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3) Please can you check your PRISMA diagram. Results of search states 203 potentially eligible articles; PRISMA states 205.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The correct number of potentially eligible articles was 205, we have changed this in the &amp;quot;Results of the search&amp;quot; section.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;4) PRISMA is not in correct format. Please can you re-do using the wizard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;We have re-done the flow-diagram using the wizard.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;5) Please check validation report - error =&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;We are aware of the high heterogeneity in the meta-analysis on oral steroids. We have discussed this in the manuscript under the heading &amp;quot;Courses of oral steroids - studies with usual care&amp;quot; and we have stated that the meta-analysis should be interpreted with caution. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table cols=&quot;0&quot; rows=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;Outcome: 1.8 Patients using at least one course of oral steroids&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;An I&amp;#178; of 96% represents highly inconsistent findings across studies, and may indicate an error in the data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;-------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marlies' reply on Emma's notes are added in italic 28/06/2013&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emma's notes on preliminary submission. 21/05/2013&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;hi Marlies and Tanja, thanks for submitting you review. It is always a bit tricky to comment on reviews at an earlier stage because there are various things that need attention so it's where to draw the line in pointing them out. I have made a list of things that need your attention below. I also asked Chris Cates to do a stats check and have returned this with you. I have a checklist on what needs to go in an abstract, so will send this to you as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Background&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;add GOLD reference&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;We have added the GOLD reference.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;We have been stung recently for misrepresenting what contacts were made with trialists for a specific update. Can you make it clear in the text if you only contacted the authors of new trials for this update or whether you went back and asked authors for all trials again for this update.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;Under the heading acknowledgements we have clearly stated with which authors we had contact concerning additional information. Both the authors we have asked for this update and the authors we have asked for the last update are listed.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;You say you have done funnel plots, but I can't see any in the figures&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;We have added funnel plots, and text on the interpretation of these plots to the review.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Risk of bias&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;suggest deleting everything from Coutas 2005b table as I presume it must be a second arm of the same trial?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;This is indeed the second arm of the same trial. The table itself could not be deleted since Coultas 2005b is a second comparison in the meta-analyses, however we have added references to the table of Coultas2005a. Is this sufficient?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;You must write something in every line of the table for the symbol to appear in the figure. Please go back and check this.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;We have checked and adapted the risk of bias tables.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Data and analyses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;It would be better if the domains of the QoL measures were presented as subgroups (as they would be in one plot which is easier for the reader). I have done this for you for the SGRQ, can you check you are happy and delete the others and do the same for the CRQ etc?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;We agree that presenting the domain as subgroups is more clear, so we adapted the SGRQ and the other questionnaires&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Please re-lable the columns and graphs to the name of the intervention and control in the data and analyses&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;We have re-labeled the columns and graphs to the self-management and control.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;1.6 - incomplete data needs numbers of participants adding!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;you should turn off pooling if there is only one trial in a forest plot (I did this for most of them going through, but do check before you re-submit..and delete the forest plots without any trials&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;We have turned off pooling when there is only one trial, and deleted the forest plots with no trials.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Search&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;I updated the search date to Jan 2013 which is the last record of a search I have from Liz. Can you check the numbers are correct for this.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;This was discussed in our emails.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Figures&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;SOF table need doing either in GRADEpro and importing into RevMan in the correct way. Or you can generate the SOF table in RevMan itself. Is this the review that Nancy Santesso helped you with the SOF table?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;This was discussed in our emails.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tables&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;I reformatted table 2 so it appears OK on the pdf version that will be published&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;Thank you for reformatting the table.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;can you add a table to summarise the main feature in terms of study design, participants and interventions for each study? This will be is a really helpful summary for readers&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;We have added two summary tables, one on patient characteristics and one on study characteristics.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;risk of bias - can you rewrite in English was is written in German (I think it's German anyhow!)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;We have rewritten in English what was written in German.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;characteristics of excluded studies - need to complete reasons for exclusion for all studies&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;We have completed reasons for exclusion for all studies.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;can you add the source of study finding to the characteristics of included studies tables - under the heading 'notes'&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;We have added the source of funding to each study.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Finally needs a spell check before submission.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;We have done a spell check before submission.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;-------------------------&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CJC final look Aug 22nd&lt;br&gt;CJC sign off.&lt;br&gt;I have altered the labels for CRQ and SF-36 scores as well as 6MW . All of these measure higher scores for better outcomes (unlike SGRQ!)&lt;br&gt;Spell check run&lt;br&gt;Toby this is ready for submission.&lt;br&gt;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~&lt;br&gt;Editing by CJC&lt;br&gt;Date: Aug 15 2007&lt;br&gt;Authors' Contribution&lt;br&gt;ACTION: none&lt;br&gt;What's new&lt;br&gt;ACTION: In the light of the previous comments I have removed the following: &amp;quot;We have undertaken subgroup analysis by study follow-up and type of intervention. &amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;Objectives&lt;br&gt;ACTION: It is odd to me that you include a non-randomised study from 1986, when you exclude early studies on the basis that clinical treatment has changed a great deal!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TE response: I agree with Chris that it is a bit strange. But in 2001, before the data collection, it was decided to exclude studies from 1985 and older. We wrote in our discussion: &amp;#8220;Because the content of self-management changes over time, it may be wise to exclude the oldest studies about self-management in the next update of this review.&amp;#8221; I certainly think this will be an important point for the next update of the review.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;References&lt;br&gt;ACTION: checked by Susan&lt;br&gt;Table of included studies&lt;br&gt;ACTION:&lt;br&gt;Metaview Labels&lt;br&gt;ACTION: *****I think the direction of effect labels need to be reversed in the HRQOL outcomes since a higher score is better?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TE: A lower score on the SGRQ is better, so in my opinion the labels can remain unchanged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Synopsis&lt;br&gt;ACTION: I have removed a couple of sentences to shorten this. Meaning unaltered.&lt;br&gt;Abstract&lt;br&gt;ACTION: &amp;quot;no significant effects were found...&amp;quot; see change in red. I have added an illustrative range of NNTs for admission (anticipating the SoF tables!!) also added these as figures. Your NNT table is very useful!&lt;br&gt;Methods&lt;br&gt;ACTION: none&lt;br&gt;Results&lt;br&gt;ACTION: Significant added in a few places in red.&lt;br&gt;Discussion&lt;br&gt;ACTION: none&lt;br&gt;Contentious issues&lt;br&gt;ACTION:&lt;br&gt;Spellchecked&lt;br&gt;ACTION: not done yet.&lt;br&gt;Next action&lt;br&gt;Back to authors to check they are happy with changes. Then Peer Review in the light of large number of new studies. This is a substantive update. Thanks for the hard work!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;--------------------------------------------------------&lt;br&gt;Dear Toby,&lt;br&gt;I have checked the text again and corrected a couple of small things. The approach with regard to the study of Coultas 2005 is clear. We were aware that including this study into the meta-analysis could cause a degree of dependence, but we did not know that there was such a solution as you have used. With regard to the conclusion, you are right that the results of Martin are showing a trend towards an increase of hospitalisations in the intervention group. However, the difference between the intervention and control group can be caused by chance (no statistical significance at the 5% level). Despite the results of Martin, we think we can hold on to our conclusion (based on the meta-analyses of 7 studies). Hopefully you will agree with us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks again for your quick reply,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With kind regards,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tanja&lt;br&gt;-----------------------------------------------------------&lt;br&gt;Dear Tanja,&lt;br&gt;Some more amendments for your consideration. There are issues throughout the analysis with double-counting the number of participants from Coultas 2005 - I have corrected this so that there are half the number of participants in Coultas 2005a and Coultas 2005b - this does not make much of a difference to the conclusions, but there are some changes to the findings. Double-counting data is a very hazardous way of incorporating data from one study twice in the same analysis, since you can easily over or underestimate the treatment effect. Our co-ordinating editor Chris Cates is very concerned about this practice and always insists on re-analysis where this occurs. I have done this for you in the review. It would be a good idea to re-read it and make sure that you can see what I have done and why I have done it. If you are happy with the changes I can pass the review on to our assigned editor for his sign off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can of course submit the review to a specialist journal. You will need to reference the review appropriately though.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Best wishes,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Toby&lt;br&gt;----------------------------------------------------------&lt;br&gt;Dear Toby,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have studied your comments, and yes I have inadvertently reported the SEMs and not the SDs for the doctor and nurse visits. I have also checked the other data of Martin (the ER-visits), and here I have also reported the SEM&amp;#8217;s (at least I am consistent&amp;#8230;.). I have re-entered the data en re-written the text.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With regard to the sub-analyses I have conferred with the co-authors and we agree with your statement that we cannot reliably infer a lot from these subgroups. Are you comfortable with leaving out the paragraph on sub-analyses for the results section? In the discussion we would mention that we don&amp;#8217;t have enough power yet for meaningful sub-analyses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With kind regards,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tanja Effing&lt;br&gt;----------------------------------------------------------&lt;br&gt;TJL: Data for Martin 2004 looks suspicious. Paper quotes 95% CIs for means of two groups (i.e. 95% CIs for both group means are quoted), and the authors look to have taken the upper minus the lower limit and divided by 3.92 to give SDs. I think that these are in fact SEMs and have used these as a basis for calculating SDs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Old title: Self-management education for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease&lt;/p&gt;" NOTES_MODIFIED="2014-07-07 11:13:26 +0100" NOTES_MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh" REVIEW_NO="EDU-COP" REVMAN_SUB_VERSION="5.3.3 " REVMAN_VERSION="5" SPLIT_FROM="" STAGE="R" STATUS="A" TYPE="INTERVENTION" VERSION_NO="13.0">

<BR/>Quality of life scores and respiratory-related hospital admission now show significant benefits. Lung function parameters do not show a significant difference. Steroid-treated exacerbations were not significantly different.<BR/>
<BR/>How this has changed the review:<BR/>The review now demonstrates that from the self-management interventions assessed in the studies assembled in the review, patients were less likely to require hospital admissions when treated with this type of intervention. There was a small improvement in total quality of life scores measured by the St George's Respiratory Questionnaire. There were no indications of detrimental effects in other outcome parameters. The effects of different components of self-management interventions and their requisite intensity requires more research.</P>

<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2014-06-23 15:44:49 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Marlies Zwerink">
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>Symptoms of patients with COPD slowly worsen over the years. This leads to loss of well-being in these patients. In research, another word for well-being is health-related quality of life. Self management training teaches patients the skills and behaviours they need to successfully manage their disease. Self-management training is becoming more and more important in the treatment of COPD. However, debate on the most effective content is ongoing. Therefore, we reviewed the evidence on the effects of self management on health-related quality of life and on healthcare use in patients with COPD. The evidence is current to August 2011.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>In this review, we assessed 29 studies that evaluated the effects of self management. Patients in these studies were followed for two to 24 months. Twenty-three studies had a control group that received usual care. A total of 3189 patients participated in these studies. In six studies, different components of self management were compared on a head-to-head basis. Content and duration of the self management programmes were diverse.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>Analysis of the studies revealed that self management training improved health-related quality of life in patients with COPD compared with usual care. Also, the number of patients with at least one hospital admission related to lung disease and other causes was reduced among those who participated in a self management intervention. These patients also experienced less shortness of breath. We found trials that compared different types of self management interventions versus each other. We had hoped that these trials would help us identify the most effective components of self management. However, all interventions were different, and we were unable to draw out the key themes.</P>
<P>The studies assessed in this review were diverse. Self management programmes differed in content and duration. Also, types of participants differed across studies. Therefore, no clear recommendations on the most effective content of self management training can be made at this time.</P>

<P>Controlled trials (randomised and non-randomised) published after 1994, assessing the efficacy of self management interventions for individuals with COPD, were included. Interventions with fewer than two contact moments between study participants and healthcare providers were excluded.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2014-02-25 13:17:46 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Marlies Zwerink">
<P>Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. Investigators were contacted to ask for additional information. When appropriate, study results were pooled using a random-effects model. The primary outcomes of the review were health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and number of hospital admissions.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-06-23 15:44:06 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Christopher J Cates">
<P>Twenty-nine studies were included. Twenty-three studies on 3189 participants compared self management versus usual care; six studies on 499 participants compared different components of self management on a head-to-head basis. Although we included non-randomised controlled clinical trials as well as RCTs in this review, we restricted the primary analysis to RCTs only and reported these trials in the abstract.</P>
<P>In the 23 studies with a usual care control group, follow-up time ranged from two to 24 months. The content of the interventions was diverse. A statistically relevant effect of self management on HRQoL was found (St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) total score, mean difference (MD) -3.51, 95% confidence interval (CI) -5.37 to -1.65, 10 studies, 1413 participants, moderate-quality evidence). Self management also led to a lower probability of respiratory-related hospitalisations (odds ratio (OR) 0.57, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.75, nine studies, 1749 participants, moderate-quality evidence) and all cause hospitalisations (OR 0.60; 95% CI 0.40 to 0.89, 6 studies, 1365 participants, moderate-quality evidence). Over one year of follow-up, eight (95% CI 5 to 14) participants with a high baseline risk of respiratory-related hospital admission needed to be treated to prevent one participant with at least one hospital admission, and 20 (95% CI 15 to 35) participants with a low baseline risk of hospitalisation needed to be treated to prevent one participant with at least one respiratory-related hospital admission.</P>
<P>No statistically significant effect of self management on mortality (OR 0.79, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.07, 8 studies, 2134 participants, very low-quality evidence) was detected. Also, dyspnoea measured by the (modified) Medical Research Council Scale ((m)MRC) was reduced in individuals who participated in self management (MD -0.83, 95% CI -1.36 to -0.30, 3 studies, 119 participants, low-quality evidence). The difference in exercise capacity as measured by the six-minute walking test was not statistically significant (MD 33.69 m, 95% CI -9.12 to 76.50, 6 studies, 570 participants, very low-quality evidence). Subgroup analyses depending on the use of an exercise programme as part of the intervention revealed no statistically significant differences between studies with and without exercise programmes in our primary outcomes of HRQoL and respiratory-related hospital admissions.</P>
<P>We were unable to pool head-to-head trials because of heterogeneity among interventions and controls; thus results are presented narratively within the review.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2014-06-23 15:44:21 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Marlies Zwerink">
<P>Self management interventions in patients with COPD are associated with improved health-related quality of life as measured by the SGRQ, a reduction in respiratory-related and all cause hospital admissions, and improvement in dyspnoea as measured by the (m)MRC. No statistically significant differences were found in other outcome parameters. However, heterogeneity among interventions, study populations, follow-up time and outcome measures makes it difficult to formulate clear recommendations regarding the most effective form and content of self management in COPD.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2014-02-25 13:17:46 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2014-02-25 13:17:46 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is characterised by persistent airflow limitation. The course of COPD is usually progressive, and it is associated with an enhanced inflammatory response in the airways and lungs to noxious particles or gasses (<LINK REF="REF-GOLD-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">GOLD 2010</LINK>). COPD is a serious public health problem and a major cause of chronic morbidity and mortality worldwide. In 2010, COPD was the third leading cause of death worldwide (<LINK REF="REF-Lozano-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lozano 2012</LINK>). Furthermore, COPD imparts a great economic burden on society, with exacerbations accounting for most of the costs (<LINK REF="REF-Toy-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Toy 2010</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2014-02-25 13:17:46 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Emma Jackson">
<P>Mortality data do not provide a complete picture of the burden of the disease because many patients with COPD exhibit progressive disability rather than immediate death. In 2010, COPD was the number five cause of years of life lived in less than ideal health (<LINK REF="REF-Vos-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vos 2012</LINK>). This is not surprising in that many patients with COPD experience slow development of functional impairment over many years and progressive loss of health-related quality of life (<LINK REF="REF-Garrido-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Garrido 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Heyworth-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heyworth 2009</LINK>). In light of this, self management training is considered increasingly important as treatment for patients with COPD. However, debate on the definition and the most effective content of self management interventions is ongoing (<LINK REF="REF-Effing-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Effing 2012</LINK>). In general, self management training aims to help patients acquire and practise the skills they need to carry out disease-specific medical regimens, to guide changes in health behaviour and to provide emotional support to enable patients to adjust their roles for optimal function and control of their disease (<LINK REF="REF-Bourbeau-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bourbeau 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Effing-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Effing 2012</LINK>). Essential patient skills for successful self management include problem solving, decision making, resource utilisation, forming a partnership between patient and healthcare provider, taking action and self tailoring (<LINK REF="REF-Lorig-2003b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lorig 2003b</LINK>). Ideally, self management training should be aimed at sustained behavioural change. Self efficacy is seen as patients' confidence that they can effectively manage their health and has been recognised as a powerful factor in inducing new behaviours (<LINK REF="REF-Bandura-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bandura 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bourbeau-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bourbeau 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lorig-2003b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lorig 2003b</LINK>). Skills mastery, modelling, interpretation of symptoms and social persuasion are believed to contribute to enhanced self efficacy (<LINK REF="REF-Lorig-2003b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lorig 2003b</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2014-02-25 13:17:46 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The original Cochrane review regarding COPD self management was published in 2003. In the first update of the review, published in 2007, it was concluded that self management is associated with improved quality of life and reduced hospital admissions with no indication of detrimental effects on the other outcome measures. However, because of heterogeneity in study designs. it was not possible to make recommendations regarding the form and content of self management interventions (<LINK REF="REF-Effing-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Effing 2012</LINK>). Since the first update, several studies have been published and new opinions have been formed regarding the contents of self management interventions for patients with COPD. Therefore we report the results of the second update of the review. In this update of the review, we have chosen to exclude studies with education as the only active intervention. Although patient education is an indispensable component of self management, education alone is insufficient to achieve the goal of behavioural change (<LINK REF="REF-Bandura-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bandura 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bourbeau-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bourbeau 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bourbeau-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bourbeau 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Effing-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Effing 2012</LINK>). To avoid ambiguity, we have removed the term 'education' from the title of the review.</P>

<P>Self management interventions were defined as structured interventions for individuals with COPD aimed at improvement of self health behaviours and self management skills. These interventions required at least an iterative process of interaction between participant and healthcare provider, and ideally also included formulation of goals and provision of feedback. Interventions with fewer than two contact moments were therefore excluded. Furthermore, at least two of the following components had to be part of the intervention: smoking cessation, self recognition and self treatment of exacerbations, an exercise or physical activity component, advice about diet, advice about medication or coping with breathlessness. Content could be delivered to study participants verbally, as written material (hardcopy or digital) or via audiovisual media. An action plan was defined as a guideline for participants describing when and how to change medication in case of worsening COPD-related symptoms, indicating (the start of) an exacerbation. Explicitly, interventions involving solely participant education were excluded. Disease management programmes classified as pulmonary rehabilitation offered in a hospital or rehabilitation centre, as well as community- or home-based pulmonary rehabilitation programmes solely directed towards exercise, were also excluded.</P>

<UNIT_OF_ANALYSIS MODIFIED="2014-02-26 10:41:28 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Emma Jackson">
<P>Most studies included in this review were RCTs; therefore the unit of analysis in these trials is the participant. One study was cluster-randomised (<LINK REF="STD-Rea-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Rea 2004</LINK>). The cluster, and thus the unit of analysis, in this study was the general practice. We decided to include unadjusted values of this study in the meta-analysis because (1) we had no information from which to estimate a suitable intracluster correlation coefficient; and (2) excluding this trial from meta-analyses did not lead to clear changes in effect sizes.</P>

<DATA_SYNTHESIS MODIFIED="2014-02-26 10:44:16 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">
<P>When appropriate, we performed a meta-analysis using <LINK REF="REF-Review-Manager-_x0028_RevMan_x0029_" TYPE="REFERENCE">Review Manager (RevMan)</LINK>. A meta-analysis was considered when at least three studies reported sufficient data for the outcome. Because of the nature of the intervention analysed in this review, we expected heterogeneity between the studies. Therefore, we performed meta-analyses using a random-effects model rather than a fixed-effect model.Inclusion of controlled clinical trials (CCTs) in this review, resulted in higher risk of bias because of their non-randomised design, and may have introduced heterogeneity into the meta-analysis when data were pooled with findings of RCTs. Therefore meta-analyses were primarily performed without inclusion of CCTs. Sensitivity analyses with inclusion of CCTs were also performed.</P>
<P>Using the criteria outlined in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>), we created a 'Summary of findings' table on the following outcomes: HRQoL measured with the St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ), hospital admissions (respiratory-related and all-cause), courses of oral steroids, dyspnoea measured with the (modified) Medical Research Council Scale ((m)MRC), exercise capacity measured with the six-minute walking test and mortality.</P>

<P>Six studies on 499 participants were head-to-head trials (i.e. they had no usual care control group; <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>). One study assessed the mode of delivery by comparing a face-to-face self management intervention with an Internet-based self management intervention after six months of follow-up (<LINK REF="STD-Nguyen-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Nguyen 2008</LINK>). One study had three intervention groups, all of which included dyspnoea self management training combined with different levels of exercise (<LINK REF="STD-Stulbarg-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Stulbarg 2002</LINK>). One study compared an exercise persistence intervention in which a mobile phone was used to coach the participant versus an exercise persistence intervention in which a mobile phone was used for self monitoring (<LINK REF="STD-Nguyen-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Nguyen 2009</LINK>). One study compared a dyspnoea management intervention versus general health education (<LINK REF="STD-Sassi_x002d_Dambron-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Sassi-Dambron 1995</LINK>), and another study compared a structured participant education intervention versus giving educational advice only (<LINK REF="STD-Kara-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Kara 2004</LINK>). Finally, one study used a 2  2 factorial design, meaning that two independent interventions were evaluated using one design.

<ALLOCATION MODIFIED="2014-02-25 13:17:48 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In most studies, computer-generated random number lists or other computerised methods were used to generate allocation sequences, some with stratification for potential confounders leading to a low risk of bias in these studies (n = 17). Two studies were controlled clinical trials, and in one study group, assignment was based on place of residence; we judged that all would lead to a high risk of bias. In nine studies, information provided on generation of allocation sequences was not sufficient to allow judgement of the method.</P>
<P>In most studies, the allocation sequence was not known by investigators or staff, or randomisation was performed by an independent person not involved in the study, and the risk of bias was considered to be low (n = 15). In 10 studies, it was not reported who performed the randomisation or which method was used; in these studies, the risk of bias was unclear. In three studies, group allocation was based on place of residence, and risk of bias due to allocation concealment was considered to be high.Risk of bias was also considered to be high in another study, which was a cluster-randomised trial.</P>

<BLINDING MODIFIED="2014-02-25 13:17:48 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Blinding of participants and personnel was not reported in any of the studies. Because of the nature of the intervention, it is difficult to blind participants and personnel to group assignment. Therefore, we assumed that in studies in which blinding was not reported, it was not performed. We evaluated as unclear the amount of bias that this would have caused.</P>
<P>When blinding of outcome assessment was not reported and we did not receive additional information from the study authors, we assumed that it was not done. In contrast to blinding of participants and personnel, seven studies reported blinding of outcome assessment and therefore were judged to have a low risk of bias. In five studies, outcome assessments were performed by independent research personnel who were not involved in the intervention, and so risk of bias was evaluated to be low. In four studies, outcome assessments were performed by study personnel who also provided the intervention or who were principal investigators, and the risk of bias was evaluated to be high.</P>

<EXCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2014-02-25 13:17:48 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In 17 studies, outcome data were complete or some outcome data were missing, but the quantities of missing data were equal in the intervention and control groups, and the reasons for missing data were comparable. In both situations,risk of bias was considered to be low. In one study, the quantities of missing outcome data were not equal in the intervention and control groups, and the reasons for this were not clear, leading to a high risk of bias. In five studies, the quantities of missing outcome data were &gt; 25%, and risk of bias was considered to be high. In six studies, information was insufficient to allow assessment of the risk of bias, and the risk of bias was therefore considered to be unclear.</P>

<SELECTIVE_REPORTING MODIFIED="2014-02-25 13:17:48 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In most of the studies, it was difficult to determine whether outcomes were selectively reported because detailed study protocols often were not available. One paper reported an aim different from that reported in the original trial, and not all outcome measures were reported completely. The risk of bias in this study was therefore considered to be high. Other detected signs of selective reporting included missing domain scores on HRQoL questionnaires and outcome measures that were reported for the short term but not for the longer term. Risk of bias for selective outcome reporting in these studies was considered to be unclear.</P>

<OTHER_BIAS_SOURCES MODIFIED="2014-06-20 15:08:26 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We additionally assessed the study of Rea et al (<LINK REF="STD-Rea-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Rea 2004</LINK>) on biases which are important in cluster-randomised trials. In Rea's study, general practices were randomly assigned to the interventions before the participants were included. For reasons unknown, the number of participants screened and included was lower in the intervention group than in the control group. The study authors state that baseline characteristics were not significantly different between groups. Therefore, risk of recruitment bias is unclear and risk of bias for baseline imbalance is low. The risk of bias due to loss of clusters is low because no clusters were lost after participant enrolment. Rea et al did not correct for clustering in their analyses, so risk of bias due to incorrect analysis is high.</P>
<P>No other potential sources of bias within studies were observed. Additionally, we explored reporting bias using funnel plots. We have created plots for our primary outcomes: HRQoL (<LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK>) and respiratory-related hospital admissions (<LINK REF="FIG-04" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 4</LINK>). The funnel plot of the MD in SGRQ total score per study plotted against the standard error of the MD seems to show a gap on the left side of the graph. This could indicate that smaller studies with effects in favour of the intervention group are less frequently published. The same could be suggested by the funnel plot of respiratory-related hospital admissions. Publication bias is just one reason for funnel plot asymmetry, so other study factors may have contributed to this.</P>

<P>This review has been augmented with a 'Summary of findings' table, reflecting endpoints related to quality of life, healthcare use, exacerbations, dyspnoea, exercise capacity and mortality (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>). The table was generated with GRADEpro software. As stated earlier, 23 studies compared self management versus usual care, and six studies (with seven group comparisons) compared different components of self management head-to-head. The latter studies are referred to as "studies without usual care" in the section below. Because of heterogeneity in the interventions, we were not able to pool studies without a usual care control group in the meta-analyses; therefore the results of these studies are described only qualitatively. Also, in the primary meta-analysis, CCTs were excluded. Sensitivity analyses with inclusion of CCTs were performed.</P>

<P>COPD-specific HRQoL was measured by the SGRQ in 15 studies (<LINK REF="STD-Akinci-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Akinci 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bourbeau-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Bourbeau 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Casas-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Casas 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chavannes-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Chavannes 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Coultas-2005a" TYPE="STUDY">Coultas 2005a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Coultas-2005b" TYPE="STUDY">Coultas 2005b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gallefoss-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Gallefoss 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Khdour-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Khdour 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Koff-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Koff 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Monninkhof-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Monninkhof 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moullec-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Moullec 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ninot-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Ninot 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Osterlund-Efraimsson-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Osterlund Efraimsson 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rice-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Rice 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-van-Wetering-2009" TYPE="STUDY">van Wetering 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wakabayashi-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Wakabayashi 2011</LINK>). The studies of van Wetering et al (<LINK REF="STD-van-Wetering-2009" TYPE="STUDY">van Wetering 2009</LINK>) and sterlund-Efraimsson et al (<LINK REF="STD-Osterlund-Efraimsson-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Osterlund Efraimsson 2006</LINK>) used the SGRQ but provided insufficient data for inclusion in the meta-analysis. The studies of Akinci et al (<LINK REF="STD-Akinci-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Akinci 2011</LINK>), Chavannes et al (<LINK REF="STD-Chavannes-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Chavannes 2009</LINK>) and Moullec et al (<LINK REF="STD-Moullec-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Moullec 2008</LINK>) were CCTs and therefore were not included in the meta-analyses. Mean total scores of 10 studies could be included in the meta-analysis. All of these studies showed lower (meaning better quality of life) total scores in the intervention group compared with the control group. The MD of -3.51 (95% CI -5.37 to-1.65) was statistically significant at the 5% level (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>). Because Wakabayashi et al (<LINK REF="STD-Wakabayashi-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Wakabayashi 2011</LINK>) reported no domain scores, only mean domain scores of nine of the 10 studies could be included in themeta-analysis. MDs in domain scores of the SGRQ were statistically significant, with MDs of -3.09 (95% CI -5.42 to -0.77), -2.75 (95% CI -4.93 to -0.56) and -5.71 (95% CI -9.17 to -2.25) for symptoms, activity and impact, respectively. The MD on the domain score of impact is considered to be clinically relevant because it reaches the minimal clinically important difference (MCID) of four points (<LINK REF="REF-Jones-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jones 2005</LINK>). Meta-analyses of total scores and domain scores of symptoms and activity revealed only minimal heterogeneity, with I<SUP>2</SUP> statistics ranging from 0% to 4%. Moderate heterogeneity was detected in the meta-analysis of domain score impact (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 51%). For SGRQ total score, we also performed a meta-analysis on the change from baseline (<LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>). This analysis showed a statistically significant difference between intervention and control groups, with a somewhat smaller MD of -2.68 (95% CI -4.16 to -1.20), indicating that the total score on the SGRQ of the intervention group decreased by 2.68 points more from baseline compared with the score of the control group.</P>
<P>When we included the CCTs (<LINK REF="STD-Akinci-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Akinci 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chavannes-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Chavannes 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moullec-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Moullec 2008</LINK>) in secondary meta-analyses, effect sizes for both total and domain scores increased, and all reached the MCID of four points (<LINK REF="CMP-002.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.1</LINK>). However, heterogeneity was high, with I<SUP>2</SUP> statistics ranging from 60% to 79%. In particular, the study of Moullec et al showed highly positive MDs in comparison with the other studies.</P>
<P>Van Wetering et al (<LINK REF="STD-van-Wetering-2009" TYPE="STUDY">van Wetering 2009</LINK>) and sterlund-Efraimsson et al (<LINK REF="STD-Osterlund-Efraimsson-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Osterlund Efraimsson 2006</LINK>) found statistically significantly lower total scores, so better HRQoL, in the intervention group compared with the control group. In the study of sterlund-Efraimsson (<LINK REF="STD-Osterlund-Efraimsson-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Osterlund Efraimsson 2006</LINK>), all domain scores also favoured the intervention group, whereas van Wetering et al found no statistically significant differences in the symptom domain.</P>
<P>In two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Chavannes-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Chavannes 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kheirabadi-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Kheirabadi 2008</LINK>), COPD-specific HRQoL was measured by the Clinical COPD Questionnaire (CCQ), on which a lower score again indicates better HRQoL. On total score, Kheirabadi et al (<LINK REF="STD-Kheirabadi-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Kheirabadi 2008</LINK>) found no difference, and Chavannes et al (<LINK REF="STD-Chavannes-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Chavannes 2009</LINK>) reported a lower score in the intervention group (0.92  0.72) than in the control group (1.74  0.95). Domain scores were reported only by Kheirabadi et al (<LINK REF="STD-Kheirabadi-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Kheirabadi 2008</LINK>) and were comparable between groups after three months of follow-up.</P>
<P>Three studies measured HRQoL by means of the Chronic Respiratory Disease Questionnaire (CRQ) (<LINK REF="STD-Faulkner-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Faulkner 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ghanem-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Ghanem 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rea-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Rea 2004</LINK>). Rea et al (<LINK REF="STD-Rea-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Rea 2004</LINK>) did not report standard deviations (SDs) and therefore could not be includedin a meta-analysis, leaving an insufficient number of studies to perform a meta-analysis. In the study of Rea et al (<LINK REF="STD-Rea-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Rea 2004</LINK>), the dimensions of fatigue and mastery showed statistically significantly higher scores, meaning better HRQoL, in the intervention group (17.7 and 21.4, respectively) than in the control group (15.7 and 20.7, respectively) after 12 months of follow-up. The study of Ghanem et al (<LINK REF="STD-Ghanem-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Ghanem 2010</LINK>) found statistically significantly higher scores in the intervention group than in the control group on all four domains (dyspnoea 19.6  5.2 vs 13.5  4.3, fatigue 17.4  5.4 vs 13.2  5.1, emotion 33.5  7.2 vs 29.7  11.4, mastery values not reported). However, Faulkner et al (<LINK REF="STD-Faulkner-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Faulkner 2010</LINK>) found no significant differences between intervention and control groups on the CRQ.</P>
<P>Three studies measured generic HRQoL using the Short Form-36 (SF-36) (<LINK REF="STD-Coultas-2005a" TYPE="STUDY">Coultas 2005a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Coultas-2005b" TYPE="STUDY">Coultas 2005b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ghanem-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Ghanem 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rea-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Rea 2004</LINK>). Mean values and SDs were available only for the studies of Coultas et al (<LINK REF="STD-Coultas-2005a" TYPE="STUDY">Coultas 2005a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Coultas-2005b" TYPE="STUDY">Coultas 2005b</LINK>) and Ghanem et al (<LINK REF="STD-Ghanem-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Ghanem 2010</LINK>); therefore, it was not considered appropriate to perform a meta-analysis. No differences were noted between intervention and control groups at the end of follow-up in the studies of Rea et al (<LINK REF="STD-Rea-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Rea 2004</LINK>) and Coultas et al (<LINK REF="STD-Coultas-2005a" TYPE="STUDY">Coultas 2005a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Coultas-2005b" TYPE="STUDY">Coultas 2005b</LINK>). In the study of Ghanem et al (<LINK REF="STD-Ghanem-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Ghanem 2010</LINK>), differences between intervention and control groups were reported, but these were already present at baseline. Therefore, the study authors mentioned significant improvement in the scales of physical functioning, role-physical, pain, vitality and role of emotions only in the intervention group. In the control group, no improvements were observed.</P>
<P>Generic HRQoL and health status were further measured using the short version of the questionnaire validated by the WHO (WHOQOL-BREF) in the study of Moullec et al (<LINK REF="STD-Moullec-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Moullec 2008</LINK>), the Illness Intrusiveness Rating Scale (IIRS) in the study of Coultas et al (<LINK REF="STD-Coultas-2005a" TYPE="STUDY">Coultas 2005a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Coultas-2005b" TYPE="STUDY">Coultas 2005b</LINK>), the Nottingham Health Profile (NHP) in the study of Ninot et al (<LINK REF="STD-Ninot-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Ninot 2011</LINK>) and the Sickness Impact Profile (SIP) in the study of Emery et al (<LINK REF="STD-Emery-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Emery 1998</LINK>). Moullec et al (<LINK REF="STD-Moullec-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Moullec 2008</LINK>) found statistically significantly higher scores on the physical domain of the WHOQOL-BREF in the intervention group compared with the control group after 12 months of follow-up (13.4  1.9 vs 9.4  2.2). No statistically significant differences were noted in the other domains. Coultas et al (<LINK REF="STD-Coultas-2005a" TYPE="STUDY">Coultas 2005a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Coultas-2005b" TYPE="STUDY">Coultas 2005b</LINK>) found statistically significant improvement in IIRS following nurse-assisted collaborative management compared with the usual care group. Ninot et al (<LINK REF="STD-Ninot-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Ninot 2011</LINK>) found significant differences in NHP between the groups, in favour of the intervention group, on the energy and emotional reaction dimensions of the NHP, after adjustment for baseline values. Finally, Emery et al (<LINK REF="STD-Emery-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Emery 1998</LINK>) found significant improvement in total function in the control group as measured by the SIP, whereas the intervention group showed no change.</P>

<P>Only the study of Nguyen et al(<LINK REF="STD-Nguyen-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Nguyen 2009</LINK>) measured HRQoL using the SGRQ and found no between-group differences in SGRQ total score. Three studies measured HRQoL using the disease-specific CRQ. Nguyen et al (<LINK REF="STD-Nguyen-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Nguyen 2008</LINK>) observed statistically significant improvement after six months of follow-up in both study groups in total score, dyspnoea, fatigue and mastery score. Stulbarg et al (<LINK REF="STD-Stulbarg-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Stulbarg 2002</LINK>) found statistically significantly greater improvement in mastery and dyspnoea in the group that received the most intensive exercise training compared with the groups that received less intense or no training, in addition to dyspnoea self management. Effing et al (<LINK REF="STD-Effing-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Effing 2011</LINK>) found a significantly higher CRQ dyspnoea score among individuals who participated in a community-based exercise programme in addition to self management compared with those who participated only in self management. No between-group differences were observed in other CRQ components.In the study of Effing et al (<LINK REF="STD-Effing-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Effing 2009</LINK>) evaluating self treatment of exacerbation, no between-group differences in CRQ components were found. In the studies of Effing et al (<LINK REF="STD-Effing-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Effing 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Effing-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Effing 2011</LINK>), HRQoL was also measured with the CCQ, but no between-group differences were reported.</P>
<P>The SF-36 was used in three studies. Stulbarg et al (<LINK REF="STD-Stulbarg-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Stulbarg 2002</LINK>) found no statistically significant differences between groups in mental and physical component scores after 12 months of follow-up. The study of Nguyen et al (<LINK REF="STD-Nguyen-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Nguyen 2008</LINK>) reported statistically significant improvement in both study groups on the SF-36 physical component scale but not on the mental component scale. In contrast, Nguyen et al (<LINK REF="STD-Nguyen-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Nguyen 2009</LINK>) found no between-group differences in either physical or mental component scores of the SF-36.</P>
<P>Sassi-Dambron et al (<LINK REF="STD-Sassi_x002d_Dambron-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Sassi-Dambron 1995</LINK>) measured quality of life using the quality of well-being scale and found no differences among the three intervention groups.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Hospital admissions&#8212;studies with usual care</HEADING>
<P>Respiratory-related hospital admissions were reported in 12 studies. Data on nine of these studies were suitable for inclusion in a meta-analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Bourbeau-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Bourbeau 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Coultas-2005a" TYPE="STUDY">Coultas 2005a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Coultas-2005b" TYPE="STUDY">Coultas 2005b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gallefoss-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Gallefoss 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Khdour-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Khdour 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Koff-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Koff 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Monninkhof-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Monninkhof 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ninot-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Ninot 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rea-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Rea 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rice-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Rice 2010</LINK>). A clinically relevant and statistically significant reduction in the probability of at least one respiratory-related hospital admission was noted among participants receiving self management compared with those receiving usual care, with an OR of 0.57 (95% CI 0.43 to 0.75). Heterogeneity was low, with an I<SUP>2</SUP> of 13% (<LINK REF="CMP-001.07" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.7</LINK>). Study-specific numbers needed to treat for a beneficial outcome (NNTBs) ranged from eight (95% CI five to 14) to 26 (95% CI 19 to 45). Differences between studies might be explained by differences in baseline risk, severity of disease and duration of follow-up (<LINK REF="TBL-04" TYPE="TABLE">Table 4</LINK>). Over one year of follow-up, eight (95% CI five to 14) participants with a high baseline risk of respiratory-related hospital admission needed to be treated to prevent one participant with at least one hospital admission (<LINK REF="FIG-05" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 5</LINK>), and 20 (95% CI 15 to 35) participants with a low baseline risk of hospitalisation needed to be treated to prevent one participant with at least one respiratory-related hospital admission (<LINK REF="FIG-06" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 6</LINK>). The studies of van Wetering et al (<LINK REF="STD-van-Wetering-2009" TYPE="STUDY">van Wetering 2009</LINK>) and Bsch et al (<LINK REF="STD-B_x00f6_sch-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Bsch 2007</LINK>) could not be included in the meta-analysis because the trialists could not provide the numbers of participants with at least one hospital admission. Van Wetering et al (<LINK REF="STD-van-Wetering-2009" TYPE="STUDY">van Wetering 2009</LINK>) found a mean number of hospital admissions for COPD of 0.36  1.00 in the intervention group and 0.40  0.78 in the control group. The mean number of COPD-related hospitalisations significantly decreased during follow-up in the intervention group in the study of Bsch et al to 0.3  0.6, and was constant in the control group at 0.6  0.7.</P>
<P>The CCT of Moullec et al reported zero respiratory-related hospital admissions among 11 participants in the intervention group and in two of 16 participants in the control group. We performed a sensitivity analysis by including this study in the meta-analysis on respiratory-related hospital admissions, and OR and heterogeneity were comparable with the primary analysis (0.57, 95% CI 0.44 to 0.73; I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 6%) (<LINK REF="CMP-002.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.3</LINK>).</P>
<P>Six studies were included in the meta-analysis on all-cause hospital admissions (<LINK REF="STD-Casas-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Casas 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Coultas-2005a" TYPE="STUDY">Coultas 2005a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Coultas-2005b" TYPE="STUDY">Coultas 2005b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Khdour-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Khdour 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ninot-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Ninot 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rea-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Rea 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rice-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Rice 2010</LINK>). The OR of having at least one all-cause hospital admission of 0.60 (95% CI 0.40 to 0.89) was statistically significant in favour of the self-management group (<LINK REF="CMP-001.08" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.8</LINK>). The studies of van Wetering et al (<LINK REF="STD-van-Wetering-2009" TYPE="STUDY">van Wetering 2009</LINK>), Wakabayashi et al (<LINK REF="STD-Wakabayashi-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Wakabayashi 2011</LINK>) and Chuang et al (<LINK REF="STD-Chuang-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Chuang 2011</LINK>) could not be included in the meta-analysis for the reason stated in the paragraph above. Van Wetering et al (<LINK REF="STD-van-Wetering-2009" TYPE="STUDY">van Wetering 2009</LINK>) found a mean number of hospitalisations of 0.75  1.29 in the intervention group and 0.96  1.35 in the control group after 24 months of follow-up. Wakabayashi et al (<LINK REF="STD-Wakabayashi-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Wakabayashi 2011</LINK>) found 0.07  0.3 in the intervention group and 0.19  0.8 in the control group after 12 months of follow-up. Chuang et al (<LINK REF="STD-Chuang-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Chuang 2011</LINK>) reported fewer all-cause hospital admissions in the intervention group than in the control group (40  27 vs 57  27); however, this difference was not statistically significant.</P>
<P>The CCT of Moullec et al reported three all-cause hospital admissions among 11 participants in the intervention group and four among 16 participants in the control group. We performed a sensitivity analysis by including this CCT in the meta-analysis, and the OR was comparable with that of the primary analysis: 0.61 (95% CI 0.42 to 0.89), with an I<SUP>2</SUP> of 41% (<LINK REF="CMP-002.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.4</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Hospitalisation days&#8212;studies with usual care</HEADING>
<P>The number of respiratory-related hospitalisation days was reported in five studies. The studies of Gallefoss et al (<LINK REF="STD-Gallefoss-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Gallefoss 1999</LINK>), Ninot et al (<LINK REF="STD-Ninot-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Ninot 2011</LINK>) and van Wetering et al (<LINK REF="STD-van-Wetering-2009" TYPE="STUDY">van Wetering 2009</LINK>) were included in a meta-analysis. No difference in mean number of hospital days was found (MD 0.33, 95% CI -1.01 to 1.66) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.09" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.9</LINK>). Moullec et al (<LINK REF="STD-Moullec-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Moullec 2008</LINK>) reported zero hospital days in the intervention group; therefore, these data could not be included in a sensitivity analysis with CCTs. However, these investigators reported a statistically significantly lower number of hospital days in the intervention group compared with the control group (zero vs 6.4  14.5).Rea et al (<LINK REF="STD-Rea-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Rea 2004</LINK>) did not report SDs and therefore could not be included in the meta-analysis. Whereas Rea et al (<LINK REF="STD-Rea-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Rea 2004</LINK>) reported no significant differences between groups in the number of bed days per participant per year, a statistically significant decrease in days per participant per year from 12 months before the trial to 12 months during the trial was noted in the intervention group; in contrast, a statistically significant increase was evident in the control group.</P>
<P>The number of all-cause hospitalisation days was assessed in eight studies (<LINK REF="STD-Bourbeau-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Bourbeau 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chuang-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Chuang 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Khdour-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Khdour 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moullec-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Moullec 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ninot-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Ninot 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rea-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Rea 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rice-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Rice 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-van-Wetering-2009" TYPE="STUDY">van Wetering 2009</LINK>).

The study of Rea et al (<LINK REF="STD-Rea-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Rea 2004</LINK>) could not be included in the meta-analysis because of the lack of SDs. The mean number of bed days in the study of Rea et al (<LINK REF="STD-Rea-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Rea 2004</LINK>) was lower in the intervention group than in the control group (3.2 vs 6.8); however, this difference did not reach statistical significance. Chuang et al (<LINK REF="STD-Chuang-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Chuang 2011</LINK>) reported a lower number of hospitalisation days in the intervention group compared with the control group (115  105 vs 190  110), but this difference was not statistically significant. </P>

Van Wetering et al (<LINK REF="STD-van-Wetering-2009" TYPE="STUDY">van Wetering 2009</LINK>) reported only changes from baseline and therefore could not be included in the meta-analysis.

<P>Exercise capacity was measured in eight studies using the six-minute walking test (6MWT) (<LINK REF="STD-Akinci-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Akinci 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-B_x00f6_sch-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Bsch 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bourbeau-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Bourbeau 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ghanem-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Ghanem 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Monninkhof-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Monninkhof 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moullec-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Moullec 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ninot-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Ninot 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wakabayashi-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Wakabayashi 2011</LINK>). Six studies were included in the meta-analysis. A between-group difference with an MD of 33.69 m (95% CI -9.12 to 76.50) was found (<LINK REF="CMP-001.20" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.20</LINK>). Heterogeneity between the studies was high, with an I<SUP>2</SUP> of 89%. The studies of Bourbeau et al and Monninkhof et al found a lower mean distance walked in the intervention group compared with the control group, which seems to be the main contributor to the heterogeneity in this analysis.</P>
<P>The studies of Moullec et al (<LINK REF="STD-Moullec-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Moullec 2008</LINK>) and Akinci et al (<LINK REF="STD-Akinci-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Akinci 2011</LINK>) were excluded from the primary analysis because they were CCTs. Moullec et al (<LINK REF="STD-Moullec-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Moullec 2008</LINK>) found a statistically significantly higher walking distance in the intervention group (510.6  80.2) compared with the control group (436.3  82.1) after one year of follow-up. Akinci et al (<LINK REF="STD-Akinci-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Akinci 2011</LINK>) also found higher values in the intervention group (190.3  65) than in the control group (170.6  55.4). We performed a sensitivity analysis by including these two studies in the meta-analysis; the MD increased to 35.90 (95% CI 1.35 to 70.44) and became statistically significant, with comparable heterogeneity.</P>
<P>Activity level was measured using the Voorrips Questionnaire in the studies of Ninot et al (<LINK REF="STD-Ninot-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Ninot 2011</LINK>) and Moullec et al (<LINK REF="STD-Moullec-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Moullec 2008</LINK>). Both groups in the study of Ninot et al (<LINK REF="STD-Ninot-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Ninot 2011</LINK>) showed a significant increase in total Voorrips scores (meaning a higher activity level) after one year of follow-up, but participants in the intervention group had a significantly higher activity level compared with the control group (absolute values not reported). Ninot et al (<LINK REF="STD-Ninot-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Ninot 2011</LINK>) also measured physical activity using a daily diary, but these data were not analysed because of non-compliance. Moullec et al (<LINK REF="STD-Moullec-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Moullec 2008</LINK>) found statistically significant improvement in total Voorrips score from low to moderate activity levels in the intervention group, whereas the score in the control group did not significantly change after six months of follow-up. Also, the intervention group was statistically significantly more active than the control group after 12 months of follow-up (12.0  5.8 vs 5.1  4.9). Faulkner et al (<LINK REF="STD-Faulkner-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Faulkner 2010</LINK>) assessed physical activity using the seven-day physical activity recall questionnaire and observed no statistically significant differences between intervention and control groups.</P>

<P>Four studies without a usual care control group assessed exercise capacity using the 6MWT (<LINK REF="STD-Nguyen-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Nguyen 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nguyen-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Nguyen 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sassi_x002d_Dambron-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Sassi-Dambron 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stulbarg-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Stulbarg 2002</LINK>). Nguyen et al (<LINK REF="STD-Nguyen-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Nguyen 2008</LINK>) after six months of follow-up observed a decline in walking distance in the group that participated in a face-to-face dyspnoea self management programme and an increase in walking distance among individuals who participated in an Internet-based self management programme. Nguyen et al (<LINK REF="STD-Nguyen-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Nguyen 2009</LINK>) showed an increase in the self monitored intervention group and a decrease in the coached intervention group. This finding did not reach statistical significance. In the studies of Stulbarg et al (<LINK REF="STD-Stulbarg-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Stulbarg 2002</LINK>) and Sassi-Dambron et al (<LINK REF="STD-Sassi_x002d_Dambron-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Sassi-Dambron 1995</LINK>), no significant differences in changes in walking distance were reported between intervention groups after follow-up.</P>
<P>Effing et al (<LINK REF="STD-Effing-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Effing 2011</LINK>) measured exercise capacity using the incremental shuttle walking test (ISWT) and the endurance shuttle walk test (ESWT). On the ISWT, they found a statistically significant between-group difference of 35.1 m in favour of the group participating in an exercise programme in addition to a self management programme after 12 months of follow-up. The between-group difference of 145.8 m on the ESWT did not reach statistical or clinical significance. Stulbarg et al also assessed exercise capacity using both incremental and endurance walk tests, although these tests were performed on a treadmill. On both tests, the group that received exercise training in addition to dyspnoea self management performed better than groups that received less exercise training, or no supervised exercise training at all. Nguyen et al (<LINK REF="STD-Nguyen-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Nguyen 2009</LINK>) assessed exercise capacity using the incremental cycle ergometer test and found no significant differences between groups after six months of follow-up.</P>
<P>Effing et al (<LINK REF="STD-Effing-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Effing 2011</LINK>) measured daily physical activity using pedometers. The mean between-group difference over 12 months of follow-up of 877 steps/d was statistically significant in favour of the group that participated in an exercise programme in addition to a self management programme. Nguyen et al (<LINK REF="STD-Nguyen-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Nguyen 2009</LINK>) assessed daily physical activity using a dual-axis accelerometer incorporated into an activity monitor. They found a decrease in the mean number of steps/d with the coached intervention and a lesser increase with the self monitored intervention.</P>

Eight studies (<LINK REF="STD-Bourbeau-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Bourbeau 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Casas-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Casas 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Coultas-2005a" TYPE="STUDY">Coultas 2005a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Coultas-2005b" TYPE="STUDY">Coultas 2005b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Khdour-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Khdour 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Monninkhof-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Monninkhof 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rea-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Rea 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rice-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Rice 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-van-Wetering-2009" TYPE="STUDY">van Wetering 2009</LINK>) were included in a meta-analysis.

<P>Performing a sensitivity analysis with the CCT of Moullec et al, who reported zero deaths in the intervention group and one death in the control group, resulted in no change in the OR (<LINK REF="CMP-002.11" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.11</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Subgroup analyses</HEADING>
<P>We planned to perform subgroup analyses on the duration of follow-up (less than 12 months vs 12 months or longer) and the contents of the intervention. Contents of particular interest were the use of an action plan, the use of a standardised exercise programme and the use of behavioural components. Subgroup analyses were considered possible when at least three studies could be included in each subgroup. Subgroup analyses were performed on our primary outcome measures HRQoL as measured with the SGRQ and respiratory-related hospital admissions.</P>
<P>Because of the relatively small number of studies with follow-up longer than 12 months, no subgroup analysis for duration of follow-up that met the criterion of at least three studies in a subgroup could be performed.</P>
<P>Action plans were used in most of the studies (17 of 23). HRQoL and respiratory-related hospital admissions were considered to be relevant outcome measures in subgroup analyses on the use of an action plan. However, because of the general use of action plans in the studies included in these meta-analyses, it was not possible to create subgroups of at least three studies that did not use an action plan in their intervention; therefore, subgroup analyses on studies with versus without an action plan could not be performed.</P>
<P>Subgroup analyses on the use of exercise programmes were performed on the outcomes of HRQoL and respiratory-related hospital admissions. In this specific subgroup analysis it would also be relevant to analyse exercise capacity as measured by the 6MWT, this was however not possible because the study of <LINK REF="STD-Wakabayashi-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Wakabayashi 2011</LINK> was the only study in that meta-analysis that did not include a standardised exercise programme. The subgroup difference in HRQoL between studies with and without exercise programmes was substantial but was not statistically significant. The MD of SGRQ total scoresfor studies with an exercise programme was -2.13 (95% CI -5.52 to 1.25), and the MD for studies without an exercise programme was -4.10 (95% CI -6.33 to -1.88) (<LINK REF="CMP-003.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.3</LINK>). Subgroup differences in respiratory-related hospital admissions between studies with and without exercise programmes were not statistically significant. The OR for having at least one respiratory-related hospital admission was 0.75 (95% CI 0.37 to 1.53) for studies with an exercise programme and 0.54 (95% CI 0.41 to 0.71) for studies without an exercise programme (<LINK REF="CMP-003.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.4</LINK>).</P>
<P>Studies with and without behavioural components showed no statistically significant subgroup differences in respiratory-related hospital admissions and HRQoL. The MD of SGRQ total scorefor studies with behavioural components was -3.61 (95% CI -7.65 to 0.44), and the MD of studies without behavioural components was -3.88 (95% CI -6.31 to -1.46) (<LINK REF="CMP-003.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.6</LINK>). The OR for respiratory-related hospital admissions in studies with behavioural components was 0.47 (95% CI 0.30 to 0.74), and the OR in studies without behavioural components was 0.65 (95% CI 0.48 to 0.89)&#8212;both in favour of the intervention group (<LINK REF="CMP-003.07" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.7</LINK>).</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-06-23 15:50:34 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review is an update of a review published in 2007 (<LINK REF="REF-Effing-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Effing 2007</LINK>). We have systematically evaluated 23 studies with a usual care control group and six studies comparing different components of self management head-to-head. A statistically significant effect of self management on quality of life as measured by the SGRQ was found, with the score on the impact domain reaching the MCID of four points. Also, individuals who participated in a self management intervention were at lower risk for both one or more respiratory-related and all cause hospitalisations, compared with individuals who received usual care. No effects of self management on lung function were found, but dyspnoea as measured by the (m)MRC was significantly reduced in participants assigned to self management. The mean difference between intervention and control groups in the distance walked on the 6MWT was not statistically significant.</P>
<P>Physiological and functional impairments in patients with COPD often go together with a reduced health-related quality of life (<LINK REF="REF-Garrido-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Garrido 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Heyworth-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heyworth 2009</LINK>). In the included studies, health-related quality of life was the most frequently assessed outcome measure, with the SGRQ the most frequently used questionnaire. In the previous update of the review, total and impact scores on the SGRQ were statistically significant lower (meaning better HRQoL) in the intervention group than in the control group. In the current update, the positive effect of self management on HRQoL of participants with COPD was even more distinct, with total and domain scores all significantly lower in the intervention group than in the control group. Only the score on the impact domain, which covers social, emotional and psychological impact of the disease, reached the MCID of four points and therefore can be considered as clinically relevant (<LINK REF="REF-Jones-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jones 2005</LINK>). Whereas the MD of the SGRQ total score did not reach the MCID, we need to consider this more carefully. First, in the subgroup analysis, we found a clinically relevant MD of -4.10 (95% CI -6.33 to -1.88) in the interventions without an exercise programme. Second, in another Cochrane review on the use of tiotropium versus placebo, an MD of -2.89 (95% CI -3.35 to -2.44) in the SGRQ total score was found (<LINK REF="REF-Karner-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Karner 2012</LINK>). Secondary analysis revealed that statistically significantly more participants receiving tiotropium experienced a clinically relevant improvement of four points in SGRQ total score than participants given placebo. Based on this analysis, the study authors considered the effects of tiotropium on SGRQ total score to be clinically relevant. The mean effect on SGRQ total score in our meta-analysis was substantially greater than that in the review on tiotropium. We were not able to perform the same secondary analysis, but based on the reasoning above, we expect that significantly more individuals participating in self management experienced clinically relevant improvement compared with participants receiving usual care.</P>
<P>The number of hospitalisations was analysed using the number of participants with at least one hospital admission. The odds ratio for having one or more respiratory-related hospital admissions favoured the intervention group. It is debatable whether this is clinically relevant because there is no such thing as an MCID for hospitalisations. However, the OR of 0.57 indicates that individuals with COPD who participate in self management are at substantially lower risk for one or more respiratory-related hospitalisations, meaning a reduction in the risk for a worse health outcome (<LINK REF="REF-Soler_x002d_Catalu_x00f1_a-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Soler-Catalua 2005</LINK>) and a reduction in costs (<LINK REF="REF-Toy-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Toy 2010</LINK>). It was expected that self management interventions for participants with COPD would principally lead to a reduction in respiratory-related hospitalisations because the programmes focus on COPD-related self management skills that aim to stimulate proper patient behaviours and actions, thereby preventing severe exacerbations and hospitalisations. However, our review data show that self management interventions do also lead to a reduction in the odds ratio for having at least one all-cause hospital admission. This was less expected since all programmes were COPD-specific and not directed towards co-morbidities. Co-morbidities are more the rule than the exception in patients with COPD, with more than 90% of patients with COPD suffering from at least one co-morbidity (e.g. cardiovascular disease, diabetes, mental health issues) (<LINK REF="REF-Schnell-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schnell 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vanfleteren-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vanfleteren 2013</LINK>). Co-morbidities in patients with COPD are associated with increased risk for any hospitalisation (<LINK REF="REF-Mannino-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mannino 2008</LINK>). Future COPD self management interventions should probably be more directed towards the individual patient&#8217;s co-morbidities to further increase the benefit on all-cause hospitalisations among patients. The latter would most likely also further increase the safety of COPD self management interventions. More generally, self management should be tailored to the individual needs of each patient.<BR/>
</P>
<P>Exacerbations of COPD are negatively associated with disease progression and health-related quality of life and are positively associated with mortality (<LINK REF="REF-Donaldson-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Donaldson 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jones-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jones 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Seemungal-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Seemungal 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Suissa-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Suissa 2012</LINK>). Only three of the included studies assessed the effect of self management on exacerbations (<LINK REF="STD-Bourbeau-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Bourbeau 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Monninkhof-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Monninkhof 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-van-Wetering-2009" TYPE="STUDY">van Wetering 2009</LINK>). Two of these three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Monninkhof-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Monninkhof 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-van-Wetering-2009" TYPE="STUDY">van Wetering 2009</LINK>) reported a higher number of exacerbations in the intervention group than in the control group. Although this might seem remarkable, a plausible explanation can be found in the underreporting of COPD exacerbations in general. Earlier studies showed that approximately 50% to 70% of exacerbations of COPD are not reported to a physician (<LINK REF="REF-Langsetmo-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Langsetmo 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Seemungal-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Seemungal 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wilkinson-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wilkinson 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Xu-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Xu 2010</LINK>). Most self management interventions include approaches to improve recognition of symptoms of a worsening of COPD. This might have led to improved recognition and improved reporting of exacerbations in the intervention group compared with the control group. Seventy-five percent of the studies in this review incorporated the use of an action plan into their self management intervention. The primary goal of an action plan is to teach patients to recognise an exacerbation at an early stage and to act promptly to the worsening of symptoms. Because an action plan is used after the start of an exacerbation, it is not intended to prevent exacerbations. However, it could lead to less-severe exacerbations, which in turn lead to a reduced number of hospitalisations. The decrease in respiratory-related hospitalisations found in this review might be a reflection of this. Another point of attention is the diversity of definitions of 'exacerbation' used in clinical trials. Roughly, the definitions used can be classified as symptom-based or event-based (<LINK REF="REF-Pauwels-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pauwels 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Trappenburg-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Trappenburg 2011</LINK>). This is reflected in the three studies discussed above, all of which used different definitions. No consensus has been reached on which definition is most accurate, but the chosen definition can seriously influence outcomes and even the statistical significance of effect sizes (<LINK REF="REF-Effing-2009b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Effing 2009b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Trappenburg-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Trappenburg 2011</LINK>). Outcome measures such as courses of oral steroids and/or antibiotics or the use of rescue medication can serve as proxy variables for exacerbations of COPD because these variables indicate worsening of COPD. Two of the three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Gallefoss-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Gallefoss 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rea-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Rea 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rice-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Rice 2010</LINK>) in the meta-analysis on this outcome reported that more participants had at least one course of oral corticosteroids in the intervention group than in the control group, with similar reversed causation, as discussed above.</P>
<P>In this update, we found an MD in distance walked on the 6MWT of 33.7 m. Although this difference exceeds the recently reported MCID of 25 m of Holland et al (<LINK REF="REF-Holland-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Holland 2010</LINK>), it is not statistically significant. Because all but one study in this meta-analysis included some sort of standardised physical exercise programme, it is likely that these exercise programmes account for most of the improvement in walking distance. Heterogeneity in this analysis was high (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 86%). Major contributors to this high level of heterogeneity seem to be the studies of Moninnkhof et al (<LINK REF="STD-Monninkhof-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Monninkhof 2003</LINK>) and Bourbeau et al (<LINK REF="STD-Bourbeau-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Bourbeau 2003</LINK>), both of which show lower values in the intervention group compared with the control group. This contrasts with the findings of other studies included in this meta-analysis. Monninkhof and colleagues concluded at the end of their study that the frequency and intensity of the incorporated exercise intervention were too low to permit an increase in exercise capacity (<LINK REF="STD-Monninkhof-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Monninkhof 2003</LINK>). In the study of Bourbeau et al, the exercise programme was home-based, unsupervised and voluntary; this may have led to an intensity of the programme that was not sufficient to achieve an increase in exercise capacity (<LINK REF="STD-Bourbeau-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Bourbeau 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>As expected, no effect of self management on lung function was found. A statistically significant effect on shortness of breath was found with the (m)MRC, but whether this difference is clinically relevant is not clear because studies on this topic are lacking. A reasonable explanation for the reduction in breathlessness score might be that patients learn strategies to cope with breathlessness during self management education (<LINK REF="REF-Norweg-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Norweg 2013</LINK>). As a result, the anxiety that patients might have for becoming short of breath during activities of daily life is reduced; therefore patients may experience less dyspnoea during activities.</P>
<P>Subgroup analyses on the use of exercise programmes, the use of action plans and the use of behavioural components were performed to gain greater insight into the "black box" of self management. Unfortunately, because most studies included an action plan for exacerbations, we were not able to create a subgroup of sufficient size to permit meta-analyses on the use of an action plan. Subgroup analyses on the use of an exercise programme revealed no statistically significant differences between studies with and without exercise programmes in HRQoL and respiratory-related hospital admissions. This indicates that improved HRQoL and reduced respiratory-related hospital admissions can thus be achieved solely with self management training, and that a standardised exercise programme is not essential in this aspect.</P>
<P>In addition to the subgroup analyses, and in contrast to previous versions of the review, we did include studies comparing different components of self management head-to-head. This gave us an extra opportunity to gain a better understanding of the effectiveness of the separate self management components. One study compared two methods of delivery of self management to the participant, and the other studies assessed which combination of components was most effective. Unfortunately, whereas between-group differences were found, studies were too unique to allow general conclusions or recommendations on effective components.</P>
<P>The additional value of behavioural components, defined as cognitive-behavioural therapy, motivational interviewing, goal-setting and providing feedback to the participant, was difficult to determine because of lack of detailed information. We have created subgroups regarding the use of behavioural components based on global information received from authors about the use of these behavioural components. Whereas the literature provides a theoretical background for incorporating behavioural components into self management interventions (<LINK REF="REF-Bourbeau-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bourbeau 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lorig-2003b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lorig 2003b</LINK>), we found no differences in HRQoL and respiratory-related hospital admissions between studies with and without behavioural components. This is probably a result of our definition of 'behavioural components', lack of information regarding these components and the limited number of studies in the subgroup analyses. Future studies should provide detailed information regarding the behavioural techniques. For example, this can be done by using an established taxonomy for behavioural change techniques (<LINK REF="REF-Michie-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Michie 2013</LINK>).</P>
<P>Nowadays, studies focus predominantly on ultimate outcomes such as health status and physiological functioning. Intermediate outcomes linked to behaviour change, such as self efficacy (<LINK REF="REF-Bourbeau-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bourbeau 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lorig-2003b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lorig 2003b</LINK>), are only incidentally measured. In this review, only one of 24 studies without a usual care control group reported the results of a questionnaire that assesses self efficacy. The limited availability of valid and patient-friendly instruments to measure self efficacy might explain in part the minimal use of these instruments (<LINK REF="REF-Frei-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Frei 2009</LINK>). Furthermore, in research on self management, it is recommended that one select outcome measures that are in line with the goals and contents of the intervention. For example, effects on anxiety and depression most likely can be expected only when parts of the self management intervention are targeted towards anxiety and/or depression.</P>
<P>When the effectiveness of self management interventions is considered, it is appropriate to take into account adherence of patients to the intervention. Adherence was discussed in eight studies and was reported as the percentage of participants attending or not attending a certain percentage of sessions, or as the percentage of sessions attended by participants. In one study, participants were excluded from the analysis when they did not meet a prespecified attendance rate, with the consequence that a per-protocol analysis was performed. An intention-to-treat analysis including all randomly assigned participants is preferred because it will give a more realistic view of the intervention effect in real life, where there will always be poorly adhering patients. However, information about patient attendance should always be reported, so that some idea about the dose-response relationship can be obtained. Sohanpal et al studied reasons for low attendance in a self management intervention for participants with COPD (<LINK REF="REF-Sohanpal-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sohanpal 2012</LINK>). The main reasons for low attendance were that participants considered themselves not ill enough, or, conversely, participants were too physically or psychologically disabled, or they had competing obligations. According to the tutors, low adherence was also caused by participants blaming others for their condition, having fear of making a change in their lives or lacking support from family or friends. Close to the concept of adherence is patient engagement to the programme (i.e. active involvement in tasks and processes); this is another requirement for achieving behavioural change in self management (<LINK REF="REF-Willis-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Willis 2011</LINK>).</P>

<P>Our searches were current up until August 2011. Since then, several new studies on the effectiveness of self management have been published. The studies of Bucknall et al (<LINK REF="REF-Bucknall-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bucknall 2012</LINK>), Fan et al (<LINK REF="REF-Fan-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fan 2012</LINK>) and Bischoff et al (<LINK REF="REF-Bischoff-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bischoff 2012</LINK>) would have undoubtedly fitted our inclusion criteria; all had a reasonable follow-up of at least one year and were sufficiently powered to detect differences. The primary outcomes of two of these studies were related to hospital admissions for COPD (<LINK REF="REF-Bucknall-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bucknall 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fan-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fan 2012</LINK>), and one study primarily focused on HRQoL (<LINK REF="REF-Bischoff-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bischoff 2012</LINK>). In the latter study, HRQoL was measured with the CRQ, and no differences were found between self management and usual care groups (<LINK REF="REF-Bischoff-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bischoff 2012</LINK>). Bucknall et al (<LINK REF="REF-Bucknall-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bucknall 2012</LINK>) found no differences between self management and control groups in COPD-related hospital admissions and deaths. However, only 42% of participants in the intervention group could be classified as successful self managers, which might clarify the lack of difference (<LINK REF="REF-Bucknall-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bucknall 2012</LINK>). It is disturbing to note that the study of Fan et al (<LINK REF="REF-Fan-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fan 2012</LINK>) was stopped prematurely because of a higher number of deaths in the intervention group compared with the control group that could not be explained satisfactorily by the study authors. When we add the mortality data of Fan et al exploratively to our meta-analysis on mortality, the OR becomes 0.98 (95% CI 0.62 to1.54). This indicates that the results of Fan et al influence the effect size, but little meaningful difference in mortality is evident between self management and control groups. However, these results need to be interpreted with caution because the analyses were just exploratory. Differences in study design and characteristics of included participants were not taken into account in these analyses; an analysis of individual participant data could contribute to the knowledge of factors influencing proper self management. The additional results of these recently published studies do not automatically fit with the results reported in this review;therefore future updates should demonstrate how this recently gained knowledge influences the results of current meta-analyses.</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2014-02-26 13:59:00 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>As we did in previous versions of this review, we included CCTs in this update. After due deliberation, we decided to exclude these CCTs from the primary meta-analyses because our data confirm the fact that their inclusion in meta-analyses led to a substantial increase in heterogeneity and therefore decreased the quality level of evidence. The main explanation for this can be found in differences in study design between CCTs and RCTs. The non-randomised character of CCTs makes them more prone to biases such as selection bias, which, in turn, may lead to biased effect sizes. For this reason, we have chosen to include CCTs only in secondary sensitivity analyses. Although the exclusion of CCTs from the primary analysis led to reduced effect sizes in, for example, health-related quality of life as measured with the SGRQ, heterogeneity is also reduced, and we believe that this has contributed to the robustness of the results of this review. These observations on our data show that one should be very cautious about including CCTs in meta-analyses; for this reason, we will include only RCTs in future updates of this review.</P>
<P>In line with recent ideas regarding self management training (<LINK REF="REF-Bourbeau-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bourbeau 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Effing-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Effing 2012</LINK>), we have made changes to the definition of self management training before updating this review. The main objective of this change was to capture studies that do not focus purely on education but also have the potential to initiate behaviour change. Because the protocols of these interventions and the reasoning behind them are in general only globally described in the articles, we have chosen to exclude studies with only one contact moment between participants and healthcare providers (having only one contact moment makes it impossible to set goals and provide feedback, let alone change behaviour). For the same reason, we have chosen a priori to exclude studies published before 1995. We believe that evolving ideas about the goals and contents of self management interventions over the years have resulted in substantially different interventions that are focused on more than just education. Moreover, health care in general has clearly changed over the past 25 years, leading to usual care groups and patient populations that are not comparable. Knowing this, we think that it would not be appropriate to pool the results of a study conducted in 1987 with results of a study conducted 24 years later, in 2011.</P>
<P>Although we have tried in this update to define more clearly criteria for self management interventions, the included interventions are still diverse, both in name and in content. The simplest interventions that we have included in this review consisted of an educational session plus reinforcement by telephone or during routine outpatient visits. The most complex interventions consisted of several educational sessions combined with an exercise programme plus an optimisation of care plan. Furthermore, a large variety of topics were discussed during educational sessions. With this heterogeneity in interventions, it is difficult to determine the most effective parts of them. As Wagg (<LINK REF="REF-Wagg-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wagg 2012</LINK>) clearly presented in a diagram, disease management in patients with COPD requires a continuum of care in which self management is part of both pulmonary rehabilitation and integrated disease management. Because it is a continuum of care, no clear borders can be seen between the disciplines, and some overlap is inevitable. Nevertheless, we decided to exclude hospital- and rehabilitation centre&#8211;based rehabilitation programmes because self management often is only a minor part of these very intensive programmes. This will make it difficult or even impossible to filter the effects of self management from other effects. We did, however, choose to include studies on home-based pulmonary rehabilitation that did not focus solely on exercise. In these programmes, training often is not supervised and action planning is frequently included. Therefore, in our opinion, these programmes resemble self management.</P>
<P>Topics that were discussed in the previous update are still relevant in this version of the review. The included studies used a broad spectrum of outcome measures. Meta-analyses often could not be performed because included studies used different methods to assess the outcome measure (e.g. different questionnaires) or calculated the same outcome in different ways (e.g. mean number of visits vs percentage of participants with ED visits). Lack of availability of data, even after contact was made with the study authors, hampered statistical combinations of data. The latter may have biased the effect estimates in the review. Furthermore, variation in follow-up was seen, the COPD population differed across studies and, as already stated, considerable variation was evident in the interventions provided. In future studies, it will be important to ensure greater homogeneity to allow comparisons with other studies and to permit the possibility of stronger recommendations.</P>

<P>Self management interventions in patients with COPD are associated with improvement in health-related quality of life as measured by the SGRQ, reduction in both respiratory-related and all cause hospital admissions and improvement in dyspnoea as measured by the (m)MRC. No statistically significant differences were found in other outcome parameters. Action plans were part of most of the studies included in the meta-analysis, and so are already considered to be an essential component of self management. However, because of the low number of studies without an action plan, subgroup analyses could not be performed to confirm this. Also, the data indicate that self management without exercise and self management with exercise are equally effective in improving HRQoL. However, because of heterogeneity among interventions, study populations, follow-up times and outcome measures, and consequent limited possibilities to perform subanalyses, data remain insufficient to permit clear recommendations about the optimal form and content of self management training for COPD.</P>

<DESCRIPTION>
<P>We additionally assessed this study on bias specifically important in cluster-randomised trials. In Rea's study, the general practises were randomly assigned before the participants were included. For reasons unknown, the number of participants screened and included was lower in the intervention group than in the control group. The study authors state that baseline characteristics were not significantly different between groups. Therefore, risk of recruitment bias is unclear, and risk of bias for baseline imbalance is low. The risk of bias due to loss of clusters is low because no clusters were lost after participant enrolment. Rea et al did not correct for clustering in their analyses, so risk of bias due to incorrect analysis is high</P>
