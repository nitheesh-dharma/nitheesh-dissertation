<DESCRIPTION>
<P>The main objective of this review was to update the previous Cochrane systematic review known as 'Non-pharmacological interventions for assisting the induction of anaesthesia in children' (<LINK REF="REF-Yip-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yip 2009</LINK>) that concluded that some interventions (parental acupuncture, clown doctors, hypnosis, low sensory stimulation and hand-held video games) were likely to be helpful in reducing children's anxiety and improving their co-operation during induction of general anaesthesia. The original review included 17 randomized controlled trials (RCTs).</P>
<P>In updating the review, two new authors (CC and MA) joined the original team (PY, PM, AVC and AMC). AVC is no longer an author or involved in this review. We found 25 new trials and included 11 of them since they met our inclusion criteria (RCT of a non-pharmacological intervention implemented on the day of surgery or anaesthesia). Fourteen RCTs were excluded either because inappropriate induction methods (n = 5) or interventions (n = 8) were used. We also excluded one which was not randomized and three studies involving adults.</P>
<P>In general our review reached the same conclusions as <LINK REF="REF-Yip-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yip 2009</LINK>. However, we included more trials and thus now have more precise estimates on some risk ratios. Furthermore, we applied several additional sensitivity and subgroup analyses which supported the overall results.</P>
<P>We have also extended our search strategy to include additional electronic databases.</P>
<P>In the previous version, the databases were searched until December 2008. We reran the searches until 28 August 2014. We have included a study flow diagram which documents the selection process of the trials included in the update review (<LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>), a risk of bias graph with authors' decision of each included study (<LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>) and risk of bias summary of each included study (<LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK>). We added one study to 'Studies awaiting classification'.</P>

<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2015-07-07 09:50:18 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>The initial process of giving general anaesthesia (i.e. induction of anaesthesia) to children can be distressing for them and their parents. Children can be given a sedative medicine (premedication) to drink such as midazolam before anaesthesia is induced in order to help the child relax. However these drugs can have undesirable effects, such as possible airway obstruction before anaesthesia begins and during recovery. In addition behaviour changes may occur after the operation. Some non-drug alternatives have been tested to see if they could help children relax and co-operate at the beginning of their anaesthesia. This review aims to assess the effects of non-drug interventions such as hypnosis, acupuncture and video games in helping with the beginning of general anaesthesia in children </P>
<P>
<B>Key findings </B>
</P>
<P>We included 28 trials (2681 children under the age of 18 years and or their parents) with a large number of interventions (17) assessed.</P>
<P>The presence of parents at induction of the child's anaesthesia has been the most commonly investigated intervention (eight trials), but has not been shown to reduce anxiety or distress in children, or increase their co-operation during induction of anaesthesia.</P>
<P>Although parents should not be actively discouraged from being present if they prefer to do so, equally parents should not be encouraged to be present at their child's induction if they prefer not to do so.</P>
<P>Most commonly other interventions are given to the child (e.g. video games or hypnosis) but sometimes the intervention is given to the parent. One study of acupuncture for parents found that the parent was less anxious, and the child was more co-operative, at induction of anaesthesia. Another study of giving parents information, in the form of pamphlets or videos, failed to show an effect. In other studies looking at interventions for children, clowns or clown doctors, a quiet environment, video games and computer packages (but not music therapy) each showed benefits such as improved co-operation in the children.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
</P>
<P>Many of the studies were of poor quality and too small to provide clear answers to the study question. However potentially promising non-pharmacological interventions such as parental acupuncture; clowns/clown doctors; playing videos of the child's choice during induction, pre-operative hypnosis and hand-held video games require further testing in future studies. Non-drug interventions that might help parents relax need further study, as there is some evidence that more relaxed parents may improve their child's anaesthesia induction experience.</P>

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2015-07-07 09:50:18 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>In this updated review we searched CENTRAL (the Cochrane Library 2012, Issue 12) and searched the following databases from inception to 15 January 2013: MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO and Web of Science. We reran the search in August 2014. We will deal with the single study found to be of interest when we next update the review.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2014-07-04 10:21:01 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>We included randomized controlled trials of a non-pharmacological intervention implemented on the day of surgery or anaesthesia.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2013-12-10 02:50:37 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>At least two review authors independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias in trials.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-07-07 09:50:18 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>We included 28 trials (2681 children) investigating 17 interventions of interest; all trials were conducted in high-income countries. Overall we judged the trials to be at high risk of bias. Except for parental acupuncture (graded low), all other GRADE assessments of the primary outcomes of comparisons were very low, indicating a high degree of uncertainty about the overall findings.</P>
<P>
<B>Parental presence: </B>In five trials (557 children), parental presence at induction of anaesthesia did not reduce child anxiety compared with not having a parent present (standardized mean difference (SMD) 0.03, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.14 to 0.20). In a further three trials (267 children) where we were unable to pool results, we found no clear differences in child anxiety, whether a parent was present or not. In a single trial, child anxiety showed no significant difference whether one or two parents were present, although parental anxiety was significantly reduced when both parents were present at the induction. Parental presence was significantly less effective than sedative premedication in reducing children's anxiety at induction in three trials with 254 children (we could not pool results).</P>
<P>
<B>Child interventions (passive): </B>When a video of the child's choice was played during induction, children were significantly less anxious than controls (median difference modified Yale Preoperative Anxiety Scale (mYPAS) 31.2, 95% CI 27.1 to 33.3) in a trial of 91 children. In another trial of 120 children, co-operation at induction did not differ significantly when a video fairytale was played before induction. Children exposed to low sensory stimulation were significantly less anxious than control children on introduction of the anaesthesia mask and more likely to be co-operative during induction in one trial of 70 children. Music therapy did not show a significant effect on children's anxiety in another trial of 51 children.</P>
<P>
<B>Child interventions (mask introduction): </B>We found no significant differences between a mask exposure intervention and control in a single trial of 103 children for child anxiety (risk ratio (RR) 0.59, 95% CI 0.31 to 1.11) although children did demonstrate significantly better co-operation in the mask exposure group (RR 1.27, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.51).</P>
<P>
<B>Child interventions (interactive):</B> In a three-arm trial of 168 children, preparation with interactive computer packages (in addition to parental presence) was more effective than verbal preparation, although differences between computer and cartoon preparation were not significant, and neither was cartoon preparation when compared with verbal preparation. Children given video games before induction were significantly less anxious at induction than those in the control group (mYPAS mean difference (MD) -9.80, 95% CI -19.42 to -0.18) and also when compared with children who were sedated with midazolam (mYPAS MD -12.20, 95% CI -21.82 to -2.58) in a trial of 112 children. When compared with parental presence only, clowns or clown doctors significantly lessened children's anxiety in the operating/induction room (mYPAS MD -24.41, 95% CI -38.43 to -10.48; random-effects, I² 75%) in three trials with a total of 133 children. However, we saw no significant differences in child anxiety in the operating room between clowns/clown doctors and sedative premedication (mYPAS MD -9.67, 95% CI -21.14 to 1.80, random-effects, I² 66%; 2 trials of 93 children). In a trial of hypnotherapy versus sedative premedication in 50 children, there were no significant differences in children's anxiety at induction (RR 0.59, 95% CI 0.33 to 1.04). </P>
<P>
<B>Parental interventions:</B> Children of parents having acupuncture compared with parental sham acupuncture were less anxious during induction (mYPAS MD -17, 95% CI -30.51 to -3.49) and were more co-operative (RR 1.59, 95% CI 1.01 to 2.53) in a single trial of 67 children. Two trials with 191 parents assessed the effects of parental video viewing but did not report any of the review's prespecified primary outcomes.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2015-07-07 09:50:18 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>This review shows that the presence of parents during induction of general anaesthesia does not diminish their child's anxiety. Potentially promising non-pharmacological interventions such as parental acupuncture; clowns/clown doctors; playing videos of the child's choice during induction; low sensory stimulation; and hand-held video games need further investigation in larger studies.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2015-07-07 09:50:18 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>The initial introduction of a general anaesthetic is known as 'the induction of anaesthesia' and can be stressful for children. Disrupted routines, unfamiliar faces, separation from family, hospital procedures and uncertainty about anaesthesia or surgery can be harrowing for patients (<LINK REF="REF-Brennan-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brennan 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Feldman-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Feldman 1998</LINK>). Minimizing anxiety and distress at the time of anaesthetic induction may therefore reduce adverse psychological and physiological outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-Greenberg-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Greenberg 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Holm_x002d_Knudsen-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Holm-Knudsen 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<B>
<I>Induction of anaesthesia</I>
<BR/>
</B>General anaesthesia may be induced by inhaled or intravenous routes, although the former is most often used for children. Some anaesthetists believe that a mask or inhalational induction is less psychologically terrifying to children (<LINK REF="REF-Aguilera-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aguilera 2003</LINK>), since children are generally thought to have a fear of needles (<LINK REF="REF-Van-den-Berg-2005a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van den Berg 2005a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Van-den-Berg-2005b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van den Berg 2005b</LINK>). Inhalational anaesthesia is induced with a volatile agent in air or nitrous oxide mixed with supplemental oxygen, usually through a breathing circuit (tubing attached to a face mask).</P>
<P>
<B>
<I>Distress and anxiety in children undergoing anaesthesia</I>
<BR/>
</B>Most children find induction of general anaesthesia before surgery very stressful (<LINK REF="REF-Kain-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kain 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wollin-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wollin 2003</LINK>), and parental stress can be easily transmitted indirectly to a child (<LINK REF="STD-Bevan-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Bevan 1990</LINK>). The level of a child's anxiety varies with age, maturity, temperament and previous anaesthetic experiences (<LINK REF="REF-Davidson-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davidson 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stargatt-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stargatt 2006</LINK>). A previously co-operative child may become apprehensive and resist the application of the mask on their face or become upset when the anaesthetic circuit is brought close to them. Children may protest, fight or try and escape during this period (<LINK REF="REF-Greenberg-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Greenberg 1996</LINK>), which may prolong the induction and be emotionally traumatic for the child, parents and theatre staff (<LINK REF="REF-Holm_x002d_Knudsen-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Holm-Knudsen 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Iacobucci-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Iacobucci 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kain-1999b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kain 1999b</LINK>). Preoperative distress has also been found to be associated with postoperative agitation and negative behaviours (<LINK REF="REF-Stargatt-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stargatt 2006</LINK>). The consequences of preoperative anxiety and distress may extend beyond the perioperative period (<LINK REF="REF-Kain-1996a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kain 1996a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kotiniemi-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kotiniemi 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<B>
<I>Pros and cons of premedication</I>
<BR/>
</B>Sedative medications can alleviate preoperative anxiety, facilitate separation from relatives or friends, and reduce distress at induction (<LINK REF="REF-Kain-1999a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kain 1999a</LINK>). However, children may refuse the drug, the drug may fail or even cause adverse reactions such as disinhibition and dysphoria, postoperative behavioural changes and prolonged recovery times (<LINK REF="REF-Ullyot-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ullyot 1999</LINK>). Other disadvantages include safety concerns (airway obstruction or respiratory depression in unmonitored situations); costs of pharmacy; additional nursing staff and equipment; list delays; and delayed discharge (<LINK REF="REF-Cray-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cray 1996</LINK>). As a result non-pharmacological methods have been sought.<BR/>
<B>
<I>
<BR/>Interventions<BR/>
</I>
</B>A wide range of non-pharmacological interventions have been used to reduce perioperative distress and encourage co-operation in children. These can be broadly categorized as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>psychological (cognitive or behavioural);</LI>
<LI>environmental;</LI>
<LI>equipment modification;</LI>
<LI>social interventions, including communication.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<B>
<I>Rationale for the review</I>
</B>
</P>
<P>Previous systematic reviews have examined the effects of patient education on preoperative anxiety (<LINK REF="REF-Lee-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lee 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lee-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lee 2005</LINK>) and the effect of preoperative fasting on perioperative complications in children (<LINK REF="REF-Brady-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brady 2009</LINK>). A Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-Uman-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Uman 2013</LINK>) has evaluated psychological interventions for needle-related procedures in children and adolescents, which includes patients presenting for intravenous induction of anaesthesia. Another Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-Pillai-Riddell-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pillai Riddell 2011</LINK>) has investigated non-pharmacological interventions for needle-related procedural pain in neonates and infants.</P>
<P>There has been no comprehensive, systematic review of the effects of non-pharmacological interventions administered in hospital to assist the induction of anaesthesia in children. In addition, information about which particular interventions or combinations of interventions are most effective in this setting has not been assessed. This is an update of the 2009 version of this review (<LINK TAG="OTHER_VERSIONS_REFERENCES" TYPE="SECTION">Other published versions of this review</LINK>).</P>

<P>Four authors (PM, AM, PY, AVC) independently examined the methodological quality of trials in relation to randomization; allocation concealment; outcome assessment; blinding of outcome assessments; losses to follow-up and treatment of withdrawals. We graded each item as 'low risk', 'high risk' or 'unclear'; or gave actual numbers in the case of losses to follow-up.

<B>Outcome assessments</B>
</P>
<P>Most studies used versions of the Yale Preoperative Anxiety Scale (YPAS, mYPAS) to assess anxiety of children. Other scales used were: hospital fear inventory; global mood scale; visual analogue scale (VAS); clinical anxiety rating scale; procedural behavioural rating scale; and the child behaviour scale. One study measured serum cortisol as a physiological indicator for anxiety (<LINK REF="STD-Kain-1996b" TYPE="STUDY">Kain 1996b</LINK>). Co-operation of children was reported in 11 trials. Eight trials (<LINK REF="STD-Berghmans-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Berghmans 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kain-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Kain 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kain-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Kain 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kain-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Kain 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kain-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Kain 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kain-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Kain 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MacLaren-2008" TYPE="STUDY">MacLaren 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wang-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2004</LINK>) used the induction compliance checklist (ICC); two trials used coping VAS (<LINK REF="STD-Campbell-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Campbell 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kain-1996b" TYPE="STUDY">Kain 1996b</LINK>) and one trial measured child co-operation by quality of mask induction (<LINK REF="STD-Arai-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Arai 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>Parental anxiety was assessed using state trait anxiety inventory (STAI) in all but one of the 11 studies reporting this outcome. The other study reported parental anxiety using the Amsterdam Preoperative Anxiety and Information Scale (APAIS). Three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Kain-1996b" TYPE="STUDY">Kain 1996b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kain-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Kain 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zuwala-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Zuwala 2001</LINK>) measured blood pressure, heart rate, and skin conductance as physiological indicators of parental anxiety.</P>
<P>Data on immediate postoperative behavioural changes in children were described in three studies employing two different scales: excitement scale (<LINK REF="STD-Kain-1996b" TYPE="STUDY">Kain 1996b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kain-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Kain 2000</LINK>) and the emergence behaviour scale (<LINK REF="STD-Kain-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Kain 2007</LINK>). Others collected data on behavioural changes beyond day one from post-hospital behavioural questionnaires. One study reported postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) in the postoperative unit (PACU), on days 1, 2 and 3 at home (Fortier 2010a). Parental satisfaction was measured by a 100 mm VAS (<LINK REF="STD-Kain-1996b" TYPE="STUDY">Kain 1996b</LINK>) and Likert scales (<LINK REF="STD-Kain-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Kain 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Palermo-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Palermo 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>Data on other outcomes of interest collected were: risk of adverse effects; time to discharge; analgesia requirements, nausea and vomiting; and health professionals' opinion regarding presence of clowns.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-07-07 03:16:24 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This updated review has shown that there are several non-pharmacological interventions that are likely to be helpful in reducing children's anxiety and improving their co-operation during induction of anaesthesia. These include parental acupuncture; clown doctors; hypnosis; low sensory stimulation; hand-held video games and behavioural intervention. Interestingly, 'parental presence' at induction of anaesthesia has been the most frequently studied intervention but has not been shown to be useful despite its widespread practice. Most of the outcomes of this review were based on single studies only. However, even single studies can provide useful information of relevance both for clinical practice and, to guide future research.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2015-07-07 03:23:56 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We have encountered several difficulties in collating the information from the included studies, as few studies reported dichotomous outcomes of whether or not the child had anxiety, distress, or co-operation (our primary outcome). Although most studies used some sort of scoring system, few used the same measure of anxiety and co-operation. Similarly other outcome measures were rarely consistent across studies. For example, of the 11 studies investigating parental presence, only six measured the outcome 'time during induction' in a way suitable for meta-analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Kain-1996b" TYPE="STUDY">Kain 1996b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kain-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Kain 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kain-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Kain 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kazak-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Kazak 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MacLaren-2008" TYPE="STUDY">MacLaren 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vagnoli-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Vagnoli 2010</LINK>). On an individual study basis, we did not find parental presence to be helpful in reducing distress of children in any of the trials, except for one study where a subgroup of 'calm parents' showed reduced anxiety of children at induction (<LINK REF="STD-Bevan-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Bevan 1990</LINK>). Apart from the possibility that parental presence may not be an effective intervention, there are several other likely reasons for this finding. Firstly, a combination of interventions was used in individual trials, especially so for the use of premedications. Secondly, several different measures of anxiety and distress were used, preventing statistical aggregation of the different scoring scales for anxiety. Thirdly, some studies failed to publish numerical results. Lastly, most interventions were visible during induction of anaesthesia in the form of specific personnel or equipment, and the assessment of anxiety was by direct observation. As a result, most participants, anaesthetists and observers could not be blinded to the intervention.</P>
<P>There is some evidence suggesting younger children have greater emotional reactions to preoperative hospitalization than older children. Stratification for age was done in one study (<LINK REF="STD-Patel-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Patel 2006</LINK>) but the number of children in each group was small and no benefit was demonstrated. Adolescents have not been studied in any of the studies included in this review. Children with chronic illness, especially those with developmental delay, who had previous surgery and hospitalization, were excluded in most studies. It is possible that these children could benefit most from non-pharmacological interventions.</P>
<P>Research into this subject has largely been performed over the last two decades. Observational tools used to assess anxiety have evolved over this time. More recent studies employed the revised versions of these anxiety scales which have been shown to be well-validated and reliable (<LINK REF="REF-Nilsson-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nilsson 2012</LINK>). Unfortunately, the trials included in this review used different versions of the scale at different time points, which prevented pooling of results. Even though we included only randomized or quasi-randomized controlled trials, poor methodology and inadequate reporting limited data extraction and our presentation of analyses.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2015-07-07 09:50:18 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>Parental presence during induction of anaesthesia in children has not been shown to reduce anxiety or improve co-operation of children. Calm parents may be helpful and parental presence should be considered on an individual patient basis. Although parents should not be actively discouraged from being present if they prefer to do so, equally parents should not be encouraged to be present at their child's induction if they prefer not to do so. The use of possibly effective interventions reported in this review, such as parental acupuncture, clown doctors, hypnosis, low sensory stimulation, and hand-held video games, are likely to be helpful in reducing children's anxiety and improving their co-operation during induction of general anaesthesia.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2015-07-07 09:50:18 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>Although we were able to include another 11 trials and nearly 1000 more participants, these trials are still too small to be adequately powered . Large randomized controlled trials are required, confirming or refuting the usefulness of some of the promising non-pharmacological interventions, such as parental acupuncture; clown doctors; hypnosis; low sensory stimulation; and hand-held video games. Future studies should consider consistency in reporting and the use of validated, reliable methods of assessing anxiety and co-operation in children during induction, preferably using dichotomous outcomes. Future studies should plan for subgroup analyses of different age groups; children with chronic illness, with behavioural problems or development delay. Such trials need to use reliable methods of allocation concealment and to describe these methods in the trial publications.</P>
<P>This review has found possible benefits to the child at induction when parental relaxation was achieved using acupuncture. This effect was not seen when parents viewed a video and information pamphlet as preparation for their child's induction. It is interesting that we have found no other studies specifically investigating how relaxation interventions with parents such as hypnosis, meditation, or yoga, might affect outcomes in the child at induction of anaesthesia. This would be an interesting area for future research.
 
Other potential areas for future research that have not been adequately investigated to date include: environmental interventions; equipment modification; number of medical staff in the room; and types of anaesthetist communications used during induction. Standardization of reporting of randomized controlled trials should facilitate meta-analyses of results and increase the likelihood of definitive recommendations regarding the utility of the various non-pharmacological interventions in future.</P>
