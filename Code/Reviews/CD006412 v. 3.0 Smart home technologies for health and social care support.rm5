<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2008-08-13 22:22:51 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>People who are ill (physically or mentally), or who are frail, may find it difficult to meet their everyday personal and social needs at home. Healthcare providers are trying to find ways to support more people at home, but finding home care workers and the money to fund this help is challenging. Advances in technology have created new devices to help support people. </P>
<P>New devices are already starting to be used, such as mobile phones tailored to health care, or electronic sensors that sound alarms in emergency situations. Another new technology is sensors. Sensors can be placed in everyday appliances in the home, like the fridge, cooker or the door, and can send information to healthcare providers.  Providers can find out how people are doing in their homes and then make decisions about their care, such as how often to visit the home. Homes with these technologies are called 'smart homes'.</P>
<P>As with many new technologies, smart home technologies are often used without first testing if they are effective. This review aimed to determine what effect any type of smart home technologies have on people. The review produced a significant volume of literature on the use of smart technologies within health care, but there were no studies testing their effectiveness. The effects of smart technologies to support people in their homes are not known. Better quality research is needed. </P>

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2008-08-13 22:22:13 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We searched the following databases for primary studies: (a) the Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care (EPOC) Group Register, (b) the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), (<I>The Cochrane Library,</I> issue 1, 2007), and (c) bibliographic databases, including MEDLINE (1966 to March 2007), EMBASE (1980 to March 2007) and CINAHL (1982 to March 2007). We also searched the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effectiveness (DARE). We searched the electronic databases using a strategy developed by the EPOC Trials Search Co-ordinator.</P>

<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2008-08-13 22:22:31 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), quasi-experimental studies, controlled before and after studies (CBAs) and interrupted time series analyses (ITS). Participants included adults over the age of 18, living in their home in a community setting. Participants with a physical disability, dementia or a learning disability were included. The included interventions were social alarms, electronic assistive devices, telecare social alert platforms, environmental control systems, automated home environments and 'ubiquitous homes'. Outcome measures included any objective measure that records an impact on a participant's quality of life, healthcare professional workload, economic outcomes, costs to healthcare provider or costs to participant. We included measures of service satisfaction, device satisfaction and healthcare professional attitudes or satisfaction.</P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2008-11-10 10:09:17 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-08-13 22:22:56 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The purpose of health and social care is to deliver targeted services which support individuals who are experiencing impaired functioning as a result of ill health (physical or mental), congenital abnormalities or frailty (often associated with ageing). The delivery of such care provides a means of sustaining people within local communities and preferably within their own home (<LINK REF="REF-DOH-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">DOH 2006</LINK>). Within the Biopsychosocial Model of Disability (a synthesis of the Medical Model (<LINK REF="REF-Schwartz-Barker-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schwartz Barker 2001</LINK>) and the Social Model of Disability (<LINK REF="REF-Clarke-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clarke 2001</LINK>)) an individual's experience of disability and their function is viewed as an outcome of the interactions between health conditions (diseases, disorders and injuries) and the contextual factors influencing performance. These contextual factors are the external environment, where the individual lives, and personal factors such as age, gender and social background (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1998</LINK>). This concept of health and disability is embedded within the International Classification of Functioning Disability and Health (ICF); a framework produced by the World Health Organization during 2001 (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>Globally, changes in the demographic profile of the world population suggest an increase in the number of people living into old age, and a corresponding decrease in the numbers within the economically active age range. The world population is predicted to rise to nine billion by the middle of this century. A complication within this is a shift in the structure of the population profile, including a quadrupling of the population aged 60 years and over by the year 2050 (<LINK REF="REF-Bloom-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bloom 2004</LINK>). This will be the first time in history that the number of older persons (those over 60 years) will exceed the young (under age 15) (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1998</LINK>). Potential associated repercussions are a higher demand for health and social care, due to the forecast increase in the prevalence of chronic illness and increase in the age of mortality, in tandem with a decrease in the workforce available to contribute towards funding and providing the care.</P>
<P>In 2006 the World Health Organization reported in the World Health Report that globally many healthcare systems are weak, unresponsive and inequitable - even unsafe (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2006</LINK>). For communities and nations a healthcare system is a labour-intensive sector and workforce issues are widely regarded as central to the successful organisation and management of health and social care. The changing population profile will invariably put pressure on an already challenged service. A major challenge to governments will be how to provide both the future financial funding of sustainable services; fit for purpose and meeting the demands of populations, and manage the challenges of decreased workforce availability to contribute to the healthcare system (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2002</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="2">Description of the methods being investigated</HEADING>
<P>Electronic Assistive Technology (EAT) refers to a broad range of devices, for example, environmental control systems to enable a physically disabled person to have more control over the home environment, or a social alarm which a frail elderly person can use to summon help if, for example, they have fallen (<LINK REF="REF-Doughty-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Doughty 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>All electronic assistive technologies use information and communication technology (ICT) as a core component, generating dynamic, often intelligent devices capable of invoking a response following an action by a user. In addition, integration of a networked ICT infrastructure facilitates device communication, widening functional capability and capacity.</P>
<P>Currently the rapid developments within the domain of ICT have spawned the emergence of devices and communication networks that are commercially competitive and offer functionality and specifications which are applicable within health and social care scenarios. The emerging applications are diverse, as evidenced by the wide range of solutions available. However, ambiguity exists around how academics, service providers and service users categorise the integration and use of electronic assistive technology. Sometimes a descriptor of the created environment is used, for example, a 'smart home', though this is not a homogenous term and on comparison the technologies within studies may vary quite dramatically. Others report in terms of a service descriptor and define, for example, 'telecare' or 'telehealthcare' to support a particular population of disabled people.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Aldrich-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aldrich 2003</LINK> has proposed five hierarchical classes of 'smart homes', which have been adopted to guide the inclusion of studies in this review. The classification is outlined below.</P>
<OL>
<LI>Homes which contain intelligent objects: environments with generally stand-alone appliances and objects, which function in an intelligent manner. For example, an environmental control system that is set up to facilitate access via the front door, or facilitate the opening and closing of windows.</LI>
<LI>Homes which contain intelligent objects, which are enabled via wire or wireless networking to exchange information with each other.</LI>
<LI>The 'connected home' or 'ubiquitous home', which has both internal and external networks allowing interactive and remote control of systems, as well as access to services and information from both within and beyond the home. In this environment the tenant is not always required to connect proactively with the technology, which is discreetly positioned in the home environment and may unobtrusively gather information in relation to the tenant. This generates data relating to the general activity of the tenant which can be used to inform the care process and alter the environmental context that the tenant experiences.</LI>
<LI>The 'learning home' builds on the preceding level and data on patterns of activity, such as water use or movement within particular rooms, are discreetly gathered and recorded. The accumulated data are used to anticipate users' needs and then control the technology accordingly.</LI>
<LI>The 'attentive home' has the technical capability to record activity patterns, and the location of people and objects is constantly registered. This information is used to control technology in anticipation of the occupant's needs.</LI>

<P>We included studies of the following interventions: social alarms, electronic assistive devices, telecare social alert platforms, environmental control systems, automated home environments and 'ubiquitous' homes. We excluded studies if they solely evaluated telemedicine applications (<LINK REF="REF-Wooton-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wooton 2008</LINK>). Therefore, we excluded the development of an acute sector service traditionally carried out in the hospital but now offered to a citizen at home with a healthcare professional based at the hospital (e.g. development of a telecardiology service (<LINK REF="REF-Scalvini-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scalvini 2007</LINK>) or remote facility to monitor patients (<LINK REF="REF-Terschuren-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Terschuren 2007</LINK>)).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="2">Summary of main results</HEADING>
<P>Smart home technologies within health and social care include a wide range of information and communication technology (ICT) enabled electronic assistive devices. These devices may operate in a stand-alone intelligent capacity to access, operate and control household appliances. In other scenarios, multiple device integration creates a home environment that is technology-enriched, thereby facilitating and supporting the delivery of a range of health and social care services. The purpose of the technology is to enhance functional independence and the quality of life achieved by either directly enabling service users, informing service providers, or both.</P>
<P>An interesting finding from this review is the lack of national and international consensus on terminology, classification or taxonomy of devices, products or service models. Some of the literature reporting on telehealth or telecare is, in effect, describing a telemedicine application. To debate the difference between the two would be helpful for both researchers and clinicians and assist with the reporting and seeking of evidence.</P>
<P>The World Health Organization has stated that the adoption of ICT in the healthcare sector often occurs without comprehensive evaluation of the health impact or a true understanding of the added value of ICT to health services (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2005</LINK>). This would appear to be the situation globally as national governments promote the implementation of technology-enriched health and social care services by a fusion of policy, investment and operational service change across the developed world.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Quality of the evidence</HEADING>
<P>This review considered a substantial amount of published literature and did not find any studies that met the inclusion criteria. Current available published studies lack the application of robust empirical methodologies to validate smart home technologies as an effective intervention to support health and social care.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Agreements and disagreements with other studies or review</HEADING>
<P>This review has similar findings to other reviews that have explored different aspects of technology within health care. <LINK REF="REF-Barlow-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barlow 2007</LINK> found that less than 1% of literature retrieved could be included in a literature review on the use of telecare for frail elderly people with long term conditions. Similarly, <LINK REF="REF-Demiris-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Demiris 2005</LINK> classified only 4.7% of the telemedicine literature as a clinical trial. Another similarity with systematic literature reviews of telemedicine is that many authors find that good quality evidence is lacking; often methodological detail is under-reported to such a degree that the deficiencies limit the generalisability of findings (<LINK REF="REF-Bensink-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bensink 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Brignall-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brignall 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Garcia_x002d_Lizana-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Garcia-Lizana 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hailey-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hailey 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mair-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mair 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Whitten-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Whitten 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Whitten-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Whitten 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Whitten-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Whitten 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Williams-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Williams 2001</LINK>).</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>This review does not provide sufficient evidence to support or refute the integration of smart home technologies into health and social care. </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2008-08-13 21:36:36 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>1) There is a dearth of well-designed studies despite the substantial amount of literature emerging from the literature search.</P>
<P>This intervention is complex, with substantial inherent heterogeneity, and impacts not only on service users but also on the service provider and the organisational processes. Opportunity exists to investigate all of these aspects of the intervention. The UK Medical Research Council has produced a framework for the development and evaluation of RCTs for complex interventions to improve health (<LINK REF="REF-MRC-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">MRC 2000</LINK>), which may prove useful.</P>
<P>2) International consistency in describing and reporting on technology-enabled interventions (telemedicine, telecare, telehealth as examples) could enhance the design, delivery, implementation and dissemination of research projects and enhance the quality and accessibility of the evidence base available for practitioners.</P>
<P>3) The adoption of any assistive technology into everyday activity is complex, yet integration of ICT into the pattern of daily routine must be assured if the full potential of the device is to be realised. Research to date, however, demonstrates that with all assistive technologies there is a high abandonment rate (<LINK REF="REF-Galvin-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Galvin 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Scherer-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scherer 1996</LINK>). Research into this aspect of the adoption and utilisation of ICT within the social context is essential to enhance understanding of integration into service and inform technology design and development.</P>
