<P>Background<BR/>Pressure ulcers (also called bed sores) are wounds caused by pressure at the weight-bearing, bony points of immobilised people (such as hips, heels and elbows). Poor nutritional status, or dehydration, may weaken the skin and make people more vulnerable to developing pressure ulcers. Once a pressure ulcer has developed, it can become very large and difficult to heal.</P>
<P>Review Question<BR/>We wanted to find out whether changing the diet (for example by giving supplements) could prevent the development of pressure ulcers. We also wanted to find out if dietary changes could help heal pressure ulcers that had already occurred.</P>
<P>The review of trials found that there is no clear evidence that nutritional interventions reduce the number of people who develop pressure ulcers or help the healing of existing pressure ulcers. More research is needed.</P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2014-06-11 14:35:15 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2014-04-30 13:41:08 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gero Langer">
<P>A pressure ulcer - also known as a pressure sore, decubitus ulcer or bedsore - is defined as "localized injury to the skin and/or underlying tissue usually over a bony prominence, as a result of pressure, or pressure in combination with shear." Shear pressure occurs when layers of skin are forced to slide over one another or over deeper layers of tissue, for example, if a patient slides down the bed (<LINK REF="REF-EPUAP-and-NPUAP-2009a" TYPE="REFERENCE">EPUAP and NPUAP 2009a</LINK>). Friction is also thought to contribute.<B>
<I> </I>
</B>Applied pressure affects cellular metabolism by decreasing or obliterating tissue circulation, resulting in insufficient blood flow to the skin and underlying tissues, and causing tissue ischaemia (deficient blood supply). Elderly patients with decreased mobility, limited mental status and increased skin friction and shear may have a higher risk of developing a pressure ulcer (<LINK REF="REF-Perneger-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Perneger 2002</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-Schoonhoven-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schoonhoven 2006</LINK> found that independent predictors of pressure ulcers were increased age, reduced (&lt;54kg) or increased (&gt;95kg) weight at admission, abnormal appearance of the skin, friction and shear, and surgery planned for the coming week (<LINK REF="REF-Schoonhoven-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schoonhoven 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>Pressure ulcer classification systems allow a consistent description for the severity and level of tissue injury of a pressure ulcer. The words "stage", "grade", and "category" may be used interchangeably to describe the levels of soft-tissue injury (<LINK REF="REF-EPUAP-and-NPUAP-2009a" TYPE="REFERENCE">EPUAP and NPUAP 2009a</LINK>). The classification includes Grades 1 through to 4. Grade 1 reflects persistent non-blanching erythema (redness) of the skin, Grade 2 involves partial thickness skin loss (epidermis and dermis), Grade 3 reflects full thickness skin loss involving damage or necrosis of subcutaneous tissue whereas in Grade 4 the damage extends to the underlying bone, tendon or joint capsule (<LINK REF="REF-EPUAP-and-NPUAP-2009a" TYPE="REFERENCE">EPUAP and NPUAP 2009a</LINK>).</P>
<P>Pressure ulcers affect a significant minority of people in hospitals and other care facilities. An economic analysis of the impact of pressure ulcer care in a 252-bed elderly care unit in Glasgow reported that 41% of the patients suffered from some pressure damage. The incidence data were reported to show that 45% of these pressure ulcers were potentially preventable (<LINK REF="REF-Thomson-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thomson 1999</LINK>). The overall prevalence of pressure ulcers in all facilities in the United States was 12.3% in 2009, with 5% of the pressure ulcers considered to be facility-associated. When Grade I ulcers were excluded, overall pressure ulcer prevalence was 9% (<LINK REF="REF-VanGilder-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">VanGilder 2009</LINK>). A Swiss study showed an incidence of pressure ulcers (Grade 2 or more) of 10% in acute hospitals (<LINK REF="REF-Perneger-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Perneger 1998</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-Schoonhoven-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schoonhoven 2002</LINK> reported a weekly incidence of patients with Grade 2 pressure ulcers of 6.2% (95% confidence interval (CI) 5.2% to 7.2%) in two large Dutch hospitals. In 2001, a study of 3012 patients (mean age 65 years) from 165 wards in 11 hospitals in Germany estimated the prevalence of pressure ulcers as 24% to 39% (<LINK REF="REF-Dassen-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dassen 2001</LINK>). Between 2002 and 2008 the pressure ulcer prevalence rates in German long-term care facilities decreased from 12.5% to 5.0%, while non-blanchable erythema decreased from 6.6% to 3.5% (<LINK REF="REF-Lahmann-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lahmann 2010</LINK>). The authors hypothesised that this decrease was due to more effective treatment strategies and better prevention. Another retrospective analysis of clinical records from 414 cancer patients admitted over six months for palliative care showed a prevalence of pressure ulcers of 22.9%, and an incidence of 6.7% (<LINK REF="REF-Hendrichova-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hendrichova 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>The prevention of pressure ulcers involves a number of strategies designed to address both extrinsic factors, e.g. reducing the pressure duration or magnitude at the skin surface through repositioning or use of pressure relieving cushions or mattresses, and intrinsic factors, e.g. the ability of the patient's skin to remain intact and resist pressure damage by optimising hydration, circulation and nutrition. There is some evidence that the incidence and severity of pressure ulceration increases with poor nutrition (<LINK REF="REF-Bergstrom-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bergstrom 1992;</LINK> <LINK REF="REF-Berlowitz-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Berlowitz 1989</LINK>). Decreased calorie intake, dehydration, and a drop in serum albumin levels may decrease the tolerance of skin and underlying tissue to pressure, friction, and shearing force, thus increasing the risk of skin breakdown and reducing wound healing ability (<LINK REF="REF-Mueller-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mueller 2001</LINK>). Serum albumin is commonly used as a measure of the amount of protein available in the blood for healing. The combination of low energy and low protein intake is often described as protein-calorie or protein-energy malnutrition.</P>
<P>A few studies have suggested a correlation between protein-calorie malnutrition and pressure ulcers (<LINK REF="REF-Breslow-1991a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Breslow 1991a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Finucane-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Finucane 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Strauss-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Strauss 1996</LINK>). The effects of special diets in preventing and treating pressure ulcers has not yet been examined sufficiently, although many risk assessment tools include nutritional status (e.g. <LINK REF="REF-Braden-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Braden 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gosnell-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gosnell 1989</LINK>). Nevertheless, there is a consensus that nutrition is an important factor, as shown by its incorporation in a variety of guidelines, e.g. the European Pressure Ulcer Advisory Panel (EPUAP) Pressure Ulcer Prevention Guidelines, which state, "<I>Consider the impact of the following factors on an individual&#8217;s risk of pressure ulcer development: a) nutritional indicators . . .</I>"; and "<I>Screen and assess the nutritional status of every individual at risk of pressure ulcers in each health care setting</I>", and urge care-providers to, "<I>Provide sufficient calories . . . provide adequate protein . . . provide and encourage adequate daily fluid intake for hydration . . . provide adequate vitamins and minerals</I>" (<LINK REF="REF-EPUAP-and-NPUAP-2009a" TYPE="REFERENCE">EPUAP and NPUAP 2009a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-EPUAP-and-NPUAP-2009b" TYPE="REFERENCE">EPUAP and NPUAP 2009b</LINK>).</P>
<P>Enteral nutrition is nourishment such as a special diet, or supplements to normal eating or tube feeding, that are given via the mouth or by tube and absorbed through the digestive system. Parenteral nutrition is nourishment such as intravenous infusion or intramuscular injection given via the bloodstream. It is unclear if the route of administration (i.e. oral feeding, tube feeding or parenteral feeding) plays a role in pressure ulcer prevention and treatment</P>
<P>This update of the original systematic review was required to summarize the best research available and to enable evidence-based guidance on the role of nutritional interventions in the prevention and treatment of pressure ulcers.</P>

<P>Two review authors independently assessed the risk of bias for each included study using the Cochrane Collaboration tool for assessing risk of bias (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). Five domains of risk of bias were assessed according to the <I>The Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>), namely: generation of randomisation sequence, allocation concealment, blinding, incomplete outcome data, and selective outcome reporting )(see <LINK REF="APP-05" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 5</LINK> for details of criteria on which the judgement will be based). We presented the assessment of risk of bias using a 'risk of bias summary figure', which shows all of the judgements in a cross-tabulation of study by entry. This display of internal validity indicates the weight the reader may give the results of each study.</P>

<P>The studies of nutritional supplementation vary in terms of interventions, outcome measurements and follow-up; interpretation of these findings should be made with caution.</P>
<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-06-11 13:55:04 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Eleven studies compared a combination of nutritional supplements, consisting of a minimum of energy and protein in different dosages, for the prevention of pressure ulcers. A meta-analysis was performed including eight trials comparing the effect of mixed nutritional supplements with standard hospital diet. The overall risk ratio (RR) was 0.86 (95% CI 0.73 to 1.00; P value = 0.05; see <LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>), Of the 6062 persons considered in this meta-analysis 4015 were participants in the FOOD Trial (<LINK REF="STD-Dennis-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Dennis 2005</LINK>). The other 2047 participants were allocated to seven trials which ranged in size from 52 to 672 participants. The trials examined clinically heterogenous interventions and were generally at high or unclear risk of bias. The clearest conclusion that can be drawn in the light of the volume and quality of this evidence is that it remains unclear whether nutritional supplementation reduces the risk of pressure ulcer development.</P>
<P>Fourteen studies evaluated the effects of nutritional supplements on the healing of existing pressure ulcers: seven trials examined mixed nutritional supplements, three the effect of protein supplements, two trials examined zinc, and two studies compared ascorbic acid with placebo. There is generally no clear evidence of improved pressure ulcer healing with nutritional supplements. There is some evidence of improved healing (as measured by a surrogate outcome measure, viz. PUSH scores) with an arginine enriched mixed nutritional supplement compared with standard hospital diet however there is no evidence of an effect on actual ulcer healing. Again most of the treatment studies were at unclear or high risk of bias. </P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2014-06-11 13:55:05 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Many studies included few patients and some had a considerable drop-out rate. Furthermore, the follow-up time was often very short, making it unlikely that true effects of interventions would be detected. Some trials reported that laboratory markers of malnutrition improved during treatment, but the clinical effects of protein, calories, vitamin or zinc supplementation on the incidence of new ulcers or healing of existing ulcers was unclear.The validity of the PUSH score as a surrogate measure of pressure ulcer healing is unclear. </P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2014-06-11 13:55:09 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Currently there is no clear evidence that nutritional interventions reduce the development of pressure ulcers or help them to heal. This conclusion should not be interpreted as nutritional interventions having no effect on pressure ulcers because the existing evidence base is of very low quality. People who are receiving health care and who are malnourished or at risk of malnutrition should receive expert nutritional assessment and intervention as per local practice.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2012-02-03 17:26:43 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Further research with larger numbers of patients and sound methodology is required to procure evidence for the impact of nutrition on pressure ulcers. Consideration should be given to constituents of the supplement, and the method of application, as one study reported low tolerance of nasogastric tube feeding.</P>

<P>The Cochrane Wounds Group Specialised Trials Register was searched for reports of trials evaluating nutritional interventions in the prevention and treatment of pressure ulcers in September 2002. The Trials Register has been developed and maintained by regular searches, using a maximally sensitive search strategy for retrieving randomised controlled trials, of 19 electronic databases, as well as handsearching of wound care journals and conference proceedings, and is regularly updated.</P>
<P>The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) was also searched (Issue 3, 2002) using the following strategy:<BR/>1. (decubitus next ulcer*)<BR/>2. (bed and sore*)<BR/>3. (pressure and sore*)<BR/>4. (pressure and ulcer*)<BR/>5. DECUBITUS-ULCER*:ME<BR/>6. ((((#1 or #2) or #3) or #4) or #5)<BR/>7. nutrition*<BR/>8. diet*<BR/>9. tube-fe*<BR/>10. NUTRITION*:ME<BR/>11.

((((((((#7 or #8) or #9) or #10) or #11) or #12) or #13) or #14) or #15)<BR/>17. (#6 and #16)</P>
<P>MEDLINE was searched in June 2003 via PubMed using the following strategy:<BR/>1. (bed sore) OR bedsore OR (pressure sore) OR (decubitus ulcer) OR (pressure ulcer) OR (decubital ulcer) OR (ischaemic ulcer)<BR/>2. "Decubitus Ulcer"[MESH]<BR/>3. nutri* OR diet OR food<BR/>4.

(#1 OR #2) AND (#3 OR #4 OR #5 OR #6) AND (#7 OR #8 OR #9 OR #10 OR #11)</P>
<P>CINAHL was searched via Ovid in June 2003 with the following query:<BR/>1. exp Pressure ulcer/nu, dh, pc, et, rf, th, me [Nursing, Diet Therapy, Prevention and Control, Etiology, Risk Factors, Therapy, Metabolism]<BR/>2. PARENTERAL NUTRITION SOLUTIONS/ or ENTERAL NUTRITION/ or TOTAL PARENTERAL NUTRITION/ or PERIPHERAL PARENTERAL NUTRITION/ or PARENTERAL NUTRITION/ or NUTRITION/<BR/>3. 1 and 2</P>
<P>The listed databases were searched by the authors for eligible studies for the earliest entrance date possible until the latest search date.<BR/>For this review there were no restrictions on date of publication, language of publication, or publication status (published or unpublished work). Experts in the field, such as scientific societies for wound healing and treatment, for nutrition and for nutritional medicine, were contacted and asked whether they had been involved in any further studies or were aware of recent or ongoing studies on the effect of nutrition in the prevention and treatment of pressure ulcers.</P>
<P>We handsearched the following conference proceedings to identify any research or relevant studies:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>the Congress of the European Society of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (ESPEN) 1996 -2002</LI>
<LI>the Meetings of the European Pressure Ulcer Advisory Panel (EPUAP) 1997 - 2000</LI>
</UL>
<P>Some additional journals to those stated in the protocol were considered suitable for handsearching. The following journals were searched by hand from 1996 to 2002:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Advances in Wound Care,</LI>
<LI>Advances in Food and Nutrition Research,</LI>
<LI>Clinical Nutrition,</LI>
<LI>European Journal of Clinical Nutrition,</LI>
<LI>European Journal of Nutrition,</LI>
<LI>Wundforum,</LI>
<LI>Zeitschrift fuer Wundbehandlung,</LI>
<LI>Zeitschrift fuer Wundheilung,</LI>
<LI>Zeitschrift fuer Gerontologie und Geriatrie,</LI>
<LI>Aktuelle Ernaehrungsmedizin,</LI>
<LI>Deutsches Wundjournal</LI>
</UL>
<P>Studies and articles cited in articles identified have also been checked for eligibility.</P>
<P>We tried to identify unpublished studies by contacting manufacturers of nutritional supplements (Fresenius, NutriScience, Pfrimmer, Braun, Ratiopharm, Aventis and Novartis), but this yielded no further studies.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Was the allocation sequence adequately generated?</HEADING>
<UL>
<LI>low risk of bias. The investigators describe a random component in the sequence generation process such as: referring to a random number table; using a computer random number generator; coin tossing; shuffling cards or envelopes; throwing dice; drawing of lots; minimization (minimization may be implemented without a random element, and this is considered to be equivalent to being random.</LI>
<LI>unclear; risk of bias. The trial is described as randomised but the method of sequence generation was not specified.</LI>
<LI>high risk of bias, the sequence generation method is not, or may not be, random. Quasi-randomised studies, those using dates, names, or admittance numbers in order to allocate patients are considered inadequate, and will be excluded for the assessment of benefits, but not for harms.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Was allocation adequately concealed?</HEADING>
<UL>
<LI>low risk of bias. Allocation was controlled by a central and independent randomisation unit, opaque and sealed envelopes or similar, so that intervention allocations could not have been foreseen in advance of, or during, enrolment.</LI>
<LI>unclear; risk of bias. The trial was described as randomised, but the method used to conceal the allocation was not described, so that intervention allocations may have been foreseen in advance of, or during, enrolment.</LI>
<LI>high risk of bias. If the allocation sequence was known to the investigators who assigned participants, or if the study was quasi-randomised.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Was knowledge of the allocated interventions adequately prevented during the study?</HEADING>
<UL>
<LI>low risk of bias. The trial was described as double blind and the method of blinding was described, so that knowledge of allocation was adequately prevented during the trial.</LI>
<LI>unclear; risk of bias. The trial was described as blinded, but the method of blinding was not described, so that knowledge of allocation was possible during the trial.</LI>
<LI>high risk of bias. The trial was not blinded, so that the allocation was known during the trial.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Were incomplete outcome data adequately addressed?</HEADING>
<UL>
<LI>low risk of bias. Incomplete outcome data adequately addressed if the numbers and reasons for dropouts and withdrawals in all study groups were described, or if it was specified that there were no dropouts or withdrawals.</LI>
<LI>unclear; risk of bias. The report gave the impression that there had been no dropouts or withdrawals, but this was not specifically stated.</LI>
<LI>high risk of bias. Incomplete outcome data inadequately addressed if the number or reasons for dropouts and withdrawals were not described.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Are reports of the study free of suggestion of selective outcome reporting?</HEADING>
<UL>
<LI>low risk of bias. Pre-defined, or clinically relevant and reasonably expected outcomes are stated in the method section and are reported in the results section.</LI>
<LI>unclear; risk of bias. Not all pre-defined, or clinically relevant and reasonably expected outcomes are reported, or are not reported fully, or it is unclear whether data for these outcomes were recorded or not.</LI>
<LI>high risk of bias. One or more of the clinically relevant and reasonably expected outcomes were not reported; data on these outcomes were likely to have been recorded.</LI>
