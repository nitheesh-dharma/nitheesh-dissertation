<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Patients with narrowed arteries of the lower limbs may be hampered by pain in their calves after relatively short walks. This limits the distance they can walk, and hence their quality of life. This is a sure sign of atherosclerosis. These patients are at greater risk of cardiovascular death and should take preventive measures. The symptoms of the disease can be alleviated by smoking cessation and exercise. The question is whether specific drugs such as naftidrofuryl also reduce symptoms, more than placebo. To answer the question, we collected all published reports of randomized trials where the drug was compared with placebo. In addition, we went back to the original data of individual patients and made one big database with all data from all patients from all trials. We included seven studies with a total of 1266 patients. The improvement of pain-free walking distance was 37% larger in the naftidrofuryl group than the improvement observed in the placebo group. In the naftidrofuryl group 55% of the patients improved by more than 50%, compared with 30% of patients on placebo. Naftidrofuryl 200 mg (taken three times a day by mouth) improved walking distance in the six months after the start of therapy. </P>

<ABSTRACT MODIFIED="2012-11-08 10:44:59 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Marlene Stewart">
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Lifestyle changes and cardiovascular prevention measures are a primary treatment for intermittent claudication (IC). Symptomatic treatment with vasoactive agents (Anatomic Therapeutic Chemical Classification (ATC) for medicines from the World Health Organisation class CO4A) is controversial.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To evaluate evidence on the efficacy and safety of oral naftidrofuryl (ATC CO4 21) versus placebo on the pain-free walking distance (PFWD) of people with IC by using a meta-analysis based on individual patient data (IPD).</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2012-10-15 13:21:48 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Karen Welch">
<P>For this update<I> </I>the Cochrane Peripheral Vascular Diseases Group Trials Search Co-ordinator searched the Specialised Register (last searched October 2012) and CENTRAL (2012, Issue 9). </P>
<P>For the original review the authors handsearched the <I>European Journal of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery</I> (1984 to 1994) and checked relevant bibliographies. They contacted the registration holder of naftidrofuryl and the authors of identified trials for any unpublished data.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>We included only randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with low or moderate risk of bias for which the IPD were available.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>We collected data from the electronic data file or from the case report form and checked the data by a statistical quality control procedure. All randomized patients were analyzed following the intention-to-treat (ITT) principle. The geometric mean of the relative improvement in PFWD was calculated for both treatment groups in all identified studies. </P>
<P>The effect of the drug was assessed compared with placebo on final walking distance (WDf) using multilevel and random-effect models and adjusting for baseline walking distance (WD0). For the responder analysis, therapeutic success was defined as an improvement of walking distance of at least 50%.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2011-04-07 14:27:52 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Marlene Stewart">
<P>We included seven studies in the IPD (n = 1266 patients). One of these studies (n = 183) was only used in the sensitivity analysis so that the main analysis included 1083 patients. The ratio of the relative improvement in PFWD (naftidrofuryl compared with placebo) was 1.37 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.27 to 1.49, P &lt; 0.001). The absolute difference in responder rate, or proportion successfully treated, was 22.3% (95% CI 17.1% to 27.6%). The calculated number needed to treat was 4.5 (95% CI 3.6 to 5.8).</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2012-11-08 10:44:59 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Heather  Maxwell">
<P>Oral naftidrofuryl has a statistically significant and clinically meaningful, although moderate, effect of improving walking distance in the six months after initiation of therapy for people with intermittent claudication. Access by researchers to data from RCTs that are suitable for IPD analysis should be possible through repositories of data from pharmacological trials. Regular formal appraisal of the balance of risk and benefit is needed for older pharmaceutical products.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2012-11-09 08:25:23 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Marlene Stewart">
<P>Atherosclerosis is a disease in which arteries become narrowed and hardened. Deposits of yellowish plaques (atheromas) containing cholesterol, lipoid material and lipophages are formed within the inner layer of blood vessels (the intima) and the inner media of large and medium-sized arteries causing arterial narrowing and reduced blood flow to the lower limbs, at rest or during exercise. Atherosclerosis of the arteries of the lower extremities is commonly labeled as peripheral arterial occlusive disease (PAOD) and more recently as peripheral arterial disease (PAD).</P>
<P>A widely accepted international classification of PAD is Fontaine's classification (<LINK REF="REF-Fontaine-1954" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fontaine 1954</LINK>): asymptomatic patients (stage I), intermittent claudication (stages IIa and IIb), rest pain (stage III) and trophic lesions (stage IV) that include lower extremity ulcers, critical leg ischemia and ultimately gangrene of the affected extremity.</P>
<P>It is estimated that PAD, either symptomatic or asymptomatic, occurs in approximately 12% of the adult population in the Western world. The prevalence of PAD increases with advancing age such that almost 20% of people over the age of 70 years have the disease (<LINK REF="REF-Hiatt-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hiatt 1995</LINK>). In the United Kingdom, one in five of the late middle-aged (65 to 75 years) population have evidence of PAD on clinical examination, although only a quarter of them have symptoms (<LINK REF="REF-Fowkes-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fowkes 1991</LINK>). In a German cross-sectional study of a population of 6880 unselected patients who were aged 65 years or older the prevalence of PAD, as indicated by an ankle brachial index (ABI) &lt; 0.9, was 19.8% and 16.8% for men and women, respectively. Patients with PAD were slightly older than patients without PAD and suffered more frequently from diabetes (36.6% compared with 22.6%, adjusted odds ratio (OR) 1.8), hypertension (78.8% compared with 61.6%, OR 2.2), lipid disorders (57.2% compared with 50.7%, OR 1.3) and other co-existing atherothrombotic diseases (any cerebrovascular event: 15.0% compared with 7.6%, OR 1.8; any cardiovascular event: 28.9% compared with 17.0%, OR 1.5) (<LINK REF="REF-Diehm-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Diehm 2004</LINK>). PAOD is also prevalent in developing countries (16% prevalence in patients with a mean age of 68 years) (<LINK REF="REF-Li-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Li 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>In a recent epidemiological study in the Netherlands of 3649 participants (40 to 78 years of age) over a mean follow-up time of 7.2 years, asymptomatic PAD was significantly associated with a cardiovascular morbidity hazard ratio (HR) of 1.6 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.3 to 2.1), a total mortality HR of 1.4 (95% CI 1.1 to 1.8) and cardiovascular mortality HR of 1.5 (95% CI 1.1 to 2.1) (<LINK REF="REF-Hooi-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hooi 2004</LINK>). The natural history of patients with PAD is influenced primarily by the extent of co-existent coronary artery and cerebrovascular disease (<LINK REF="REF-Coffman-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Coffman 1979</LINK>). The majority of deaths are either sudden or secondary to myocardial infarction. The evolution from asymptomatic to symptomatic disease, the severity of symptoms in intermittent claudication and the transition to stages III and IV are influenced by the extent of the anatomical narrowing of the affected vessel(s) and any existence of a collateral circulation.</P>
<P>The symptoms of intermittent claudication (IC) are pain, ache, cramp or sense of fatigue in the muscles of the affected limb(s); which occurs during exercise and is relieved with rest. The occurrence of IC increases with age with a prevalence of &lt; 1% among people younger than 49 years and as high as 24% among those aged 85 years and over; the prevalence of IC in people aged over 70 years approaches 18% (<LINK REF="REF-Carman-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carman 2000</LINK>). Prevalence of IC is higher in males than females (two to three men for every woman) and there is no change in this ratio with increasing age (<LINK REF="REF-Dormandy-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dormandy 2000</LINK>). According to the Edinburgh Artery Study the prevalence in men aged 50 to 59 years is 2.2% and rises to 7.7% for men aged 70 to 74 years (<LINK REF="REF-Fowkes-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fowkes 1991</LINK>). Patients with IC have a three times higher incidence of cardiovascular mortality compared with patients without IC due to the presence of systemic atherosclerosis (<LINK REF="REF-Criqui-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Criqui 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hiatt-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hiatt 1995</LINK>). Smoking cessation plays a vital role in the management (<LINK REF="REF-Verhaege-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Verhaege 1998</LINK>). Regular exercise and smoking cessation can improve the symptoms of IC and may be beneficial for any associated coronary artery or cerebrovascular disease (<LINK REF="REF-Leng-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leng 2000</LINK>). Conservative treatment should achieve improvement of functional capacity, that is an increase in walking distances, a reduction in symptoms, enhanced quality of life, inhibition of progression of atherosclerotic lesions and reduction of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular morbidity and mortality. To conform with the latest European and American regulatory guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-TASC-II-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">TASC II 2007</LINK>), improvement of functional capacity for a patient is assessed by measuring the improvement of walking distance as the main study parameter.</P>
<P>The pharmacological management of IC remains to be defined precisely. To date, drugs with proven efficacy in the prevention of major cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events in PAD patients include antiplatelet agents (<LINK REF="REF-CLIPS-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">CLIPS 2007</LINK>) and lipid-lowering drugs (statins) (<LINK REF="REF-Burns-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burns 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mohler-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mohler 2003</LINK>). Agents such as 'vasodilators' (naftidrofuryl, pentoxifylline, buflomedil), cilostazol and others (levocarnitine, ginkgo biloba and L-carnitine) have been used although the availability of robust data to support their role remains lacking (<LINK REF="REF-Moher-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 2000</LINK>). With regard to the so-called vasoactive agents (the C04A class in the Anatomic Therapeutic Chemical Classification for medicines from the World Health Organisation) (<LINK REF="REF-WHO" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO</LINK>), controversy has reigned because evidence of clinical efficacy in improving functional capacity is not convincing. In an attempt to resolve this issue, several meta-analyses of these drugs for intermittent claudication have been undertaken (<LINK REF="REF-De-Backer-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">De Backer 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Girolami-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Girolami 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hood-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hood 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lehert-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lehert 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Walker-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walker 1995</LINK>). Overall the conclusions of these reviews are that the effects of the C04A drugs are modest. However, since this class consists of such a heterogenous group of products, in terms of their mechanism of action, it is possible that there are differences between them in clinical efficacy. Hence, new reviews should focus on placebo-controlled trials of the clinical efficacy of single drugs. In the most recent systematic review dedicated specifically to the class of vasoactive drugs, naftidrofuryl was singled out as a potential candidate for further research (<LINK REF="REF-De-Backer-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">De Backer 2000</LINK>). The most recent narrative review, specifically on the use of naftidrofuryl in the treatment of intermittent claudication (<LINK REF="REF-Goldsmith-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goldsmith 2005</LINK>), also supports a clinical relevant effect of naftidrofuryl in patients with intermittent claudication.</P>
<P>All the previous reviews of class C04A drugs which engaged in meta-analyses were based on published aggregate data, where the average results of several studies are pooled into one meta-analytic result. Although this is the dominant method, and a valuable approach for synthesizing efficacy data on medicinal products, it may have several drawbacks. In meta-analyses based on published aggregate data there may be insufficient information available on the variability of the results. Confidence intervals may be provided for baseline and final values but not for the mean change in the primary measure. It is possible to provide approximate estimates in such a situation by calculating the standard deviation (SD) of a difference from the SD of the initial and final visits but these estimates are inaccurate. In older papers the change in walking distance was recorded as an arithmetic mean. In more recent papers it is the geometric mean of the ratio between the walking distance at baseline and the walking distance at final assessment that is recorded. The difference between these two statistics could be important, depending on the skewness of the distribution of the results.</P>
<P>To overcome the limitations of a meta-analysis based on published aggregate data methodology we undertook a meta-analysis based on individual patient data (IPD). This allowed us to overcome differences in populations in the different studies over the last 20 years due to changes in study selection guidelines issued by regulatory authorities. In addition, it was possible to correct the usual approach of older studies, to report on a per-protocol (PP) population, by performing an intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis of all randomized participants as insisted upon in recent guidelines for randomized controlled trials. The inherent drawback of an IPD meta-analysis is the considerable work involved in finding and reorganizing raw data. In this respect carrying out an IPD analysis for the C04A drugs combined would be a large and probably unfeasible task. Hence, we focused on naftidrofuryl as this is one of the only drugs in the class where a minimum of studies of acceptable methodological quality are available (<LINK REF="REF-De-Backer-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">De Backer 2000</LINK>). In addition, preliminary contacts with the manufacturer (Merck laboratories) and with the study investigators led us to believe that it would be possible to get access to the individual patient data for most of the trials.</P>
<P>Naftidrofuryl is a vasoactive drug that has been marketed since 1968 for the treatment of PAD. The putative mechanisms of action are selective blockade of vascular and platelet 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT2) receptors and stimulation of the intracellular tricarboxylic acid cycle with increased adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production (<LINK REF="REF-Lehert-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lehert 1990</LINK>). Although not a conventional vasodilator, naftidrofuryl is included in the ATC therapeutic class of peripheral vasodilators (C04A). Successive small trials with this drug have shown moderate but significant effects. However, the clinical relevance of a classical meta-analysis based on the literature was questioned because of the heterogeneity among the trials (<LINK REF="REF-De-Backer-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">De Backer 2000</LINK>).<BR/>
<BR/>Naftidrofuryl is an old drug with an acceptable safety record that has been widely used. The recommended oral dosage for the indication of intermittent claudication has remained unchanged at 200 mg three times per day. Its patent has expired and there is a wide choice of generics in most countries. Consequently daily treatment costs are rather low (around one euro per day).</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Study selection</HEADING>
<P>From the results of the above search strategy, TDB and RVS selected the relevant RCTs based on the abstracts of the identified articles or, if necessary, the original publication.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Quality assessment</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Assessment of the quality of trials based on the published reports</HEADING>
<P>We assessed the methodological quality of the selected publications of trials and unpublished reports, for both the quality of the trial and the reporting, using the approach of a previous systematic review of vasodilators (<LINK REF="REF-De-Backer-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">De Backer 2000</LINK>). The original report of all selected trials was transformed into a structured abstract (prepared by TDB and RVS).</P>
<P>We assessed internal validity using the validated scale developed by Jadad et al (<LINK REF="REF-Jadad-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jadad 1996</LINK>) which includes appropriateness of randomization, double blinding and a description of dropouts and withdrawals by intervention group.</P>
<P>As in the previous systematic review based on the literature (<LINK REF="REF-De-Backer-2000b" TYPE="REFERENCE">De Backer 2000b</LINK>), we set three additional quality criteria: sufficient reporting of variability of results, minimum sample size of the study (30 participants) and minimum duration of the study (three months), in accordance with generally accepted methodological standards (<LINK REF="REF-Cameron-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cameron 1988</LINK>).</P>
<P>Two authors (TDB and RVS) assessed for quality the full publications and the structured abstracts of the clinical trials not identified in the previous systematic review (<LINK REF="REF-De-Backer-2000b" TYPE="REFERENCE">De Backer 2000b</LINK>). A third author (LVB) arbitrated if there was disagreement. We only used data for the final analysis from unpublished reports or publications of trials with an acceptable quality. If trials were eliminated by quality criteria we performed a sensitivity analysis to assess the stability of the results.</P>
<P>Additional elements used to appraise the quality of the studies were:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>obsolete dosage (&lt; 600 mg daily);</LI>
<LI>a target population not corresponding to PAD stage II;</LI>
<LI>study conducted before 1980 (quality control considered too poor);</LI>
<LI>cross-over design (because of important carry-over effects).</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Assessment of the quality of trials based on the individual patient data (IPD)</HEADING>
<P>We checked the availability of IPD data for the selected trials by sending a request to the registration holder for unconditional delivery of blinded data.</P>
<P>Reasons to exclude studies were:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>too many missing variables or an important overall rate of missing data (&gt; 10% after case report form (CRF) consultation);</LI>
<LI>the following variables missing in &gt; 5% of patients: randomization treatment code, walking distance (WD) at baseline, WD at final stage of analysis;</LI>
<LI>the following variables missing in &gt; 20% of patients: age, gender, end-of-file status;</LI>
<LI>doubt about reliability of the computer data compared with CRF data;</LI>
<LI>questionable data (published results different from database). In our checks for data reliability we were able to isolate, in our database of all randomized patients, only the patients for which data were used in each of the historical publications (some data were per protocol and some by an intention to treat, see Methods section). Hence we were able to check whether the aggregate data from these patients, as presented in our IPD database, fully matched the results of the patients used in the historical publication; only a very small margin of error was allowed (less than 1% deviation).</LI>
</UL>
<P>This quality procedure resulted in the exclusion and inclusion of studies through a consensus discussion process involving all the authors of the original protocol. Studies were excluded because of serious quality flaws or unavailability of IPD data, or both. The included studies were divided into a group of main studies (acceptable quality and IPD available) and a second group of supportive studies (not compliant with all of the above quality criteria but IPD data available). Data from the main and supportive studies constituted the IPD database.</P>
</SUBSECTION>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Data collection for the IPD meta-analysis</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Search for the original patient data</HEADING>
<P>After identification of the relevant trials, the data collection in the IPD meta-analysis constituted a long and complex process involving the different research teams of the included trials, and possibly the manufacturing company, with a request to access either the original data on printed CRFs or the databases into which the raw data were entered. Computerized data entry files are available in various mainframe formats whereas for other older studies only the CRFs are likely to have been retained. All available data were entered in a common pooled database.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Data integrity checks</HEADING>
<P>For data collected from secondary databases, we performed a statistical quality control procedure against the original CRFs by using a military control process, 105D (<LINK REF="REF-Mil_x002d_STD-105D" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mil-STD 105D</LINK>), based on random sampling of cases to be checked. At database completion we sent the registration holder (keeper of the CRFs) a list of values randomly distributed among patients and variables, with patient and variable identification but without the value, with the aim of filling in each value at the CRF level. The returned values were compared with our database and a failure rate was calculated. A random subset of 150 values were sent, with a failure rate cut-off of k = 0. The following key variables were retained: study, centre, patient number; gender; walking distance at baseline (WD0), last carried forward claudication distance (WDf); weight (kg) and age (years).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Checks for publication bias</HEADING>
<P>We intended to assess possible publication bias through funnel plots and the method of Egger that is based on visual representation of the correlation between effect size and sample size (<LINK REF="REF-Egger-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Egger 1997</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Final decision to proceed with the IPD analysis</HEADING>
<P>Two authors (TDB and PL) supervised this procedure. As soon as the information on quality and availability of the individual patient data from the selected trials was finalized, a decision was made as to the continuation of this research. This decision was made by the authors, with consensus.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Data extraction</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Construction of the pooled database</HEADING>
<P>Any randomized patient for whom a CRF or database record was available was entered in the pooled database (using the intention-to-treat (ITT) principle or full analysis set (FAS) procedure). In particular, data from patients lost to follow up and excluded in per-protocol analyses were retrieved. In addition, in some older studies it was possible that analysts retrospectively excluded patients from the final analyses based on post-hoc criteria although fully completed CRFs or database records of these patients (excluded from the analysis but randomized) were available. The data on these patients were also retrieved.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Main variables</HEADING>
<P>We considered the following variables to be important. If these variables were not documented in the secondary databases we then re-examined the CRFs.</P>
<P>(1) Dates of visits, centre number and patient number.</P>
<P>(2) Termination status (or end-of-trial status), including detailed definition of the reason for early termination:<BR/>0 = normal termination;<BR/>1 = lost to follow up with no apparent reason;<BR/>2 = adverse drug-related reaction;<BR/>3 = intercurrent disease, not drug related;<BR/>4 = interruption due to lack of compliance;<BR/>5 = refusal to participate any longer;<BR/>6 = interruption due to protocol violation;<BR/>7 = death or serious cardiovascular event;<BR/>8 = interruption for surgery;<BR/>9 = discontinuation due to local deterioration or progression to PAD stage III.</P>
<P>(3) Follow-up variables. The ability to evaluate were described as: patient was excluded based on post-hoc criteria; patient not evaluated on a per-protocol analysis; patient included in the original analysis (ITT, restricted ITT or per protocol).</P>
<P>(4) Demographic variables: gender, age, height, weight, body mass index (BMI), illness duration, month of randomization, brachial systolic blood pressure and ankle systolic blood pressure at baseline.</P>
<P>(5) Various risk factors: history of smoking, hypertension, obesity, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, cerebrovascular or cardiovascular events.</P>
<P>(6) Walking distance measurement: pain-free walking distance (PFWD) measured at selection, baseline, day 90, day 180 and last observation carried forward; maximum walking distance (MWD), if available.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Statistical analysis</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Patient selection</HEADING>
<P>The main analysis was based on intention to treat, where all the randomized patients were considered. Two other selections were used for support, essentially for checking consistency with historical results: per-protocol patients (study completers and fully compliant to the regimen) and restricted intention-to-treat (rIT) patients (randomized patients with at least one post-baseline value).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Analysis organization</HEADING>
<P>During the data collection a statistical analysis plan (SAP) was agreed by the team. This analysis conformed with the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products (EMEA) regulatory guidelines for PAD (<LINK REF="REF-CPMP-Working-Party" TYPE="REFERENCE">CPMP Working Party</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-EMEA" TYPE="REFERENCE">EMEA</LINK>). All the analyses were carried out with SAS (version 9.1). After the data integrity check the database was locked. The treatment codes were unknown at the time of the data collection and only provided at the end of the analysis process.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Missing data imputation</HEADING>
<P>For missing main endpoint data, the worst case value was attributed to patients who interrupted the trial early for a reason related to PAD (progression to stage III and IV, aggravation, hospitalization or surgery). For all the other randomized patients who stopped for a reason unrelated to PAD, the last observation carried forward (LOCF) was used as occurs in most PAD trials. However, for sensitivity assessment purposes we carried out an alternative analysis by using summary statistics (mean of intermediate, non-missing post-baseline values) when at least two intermediate observations were available. For covariables, missing data were checked for at random and imputed by a systematic full information maximum likelihood (FIML) technique (<LINK REF="REF-Anderson-1957" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anderson 1957</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Main endpoint</HEADING>
<P>Our primary measurement was the pain-free walking distance (PFWD) measured at baseline and on final assessment, in both naftidrofuryl and placebo treatment groups. We used as the main endpoint the relative improvement RI = WDf/WD0, where WDf and WD0 designated final and baseline PFWD values respectively. The geometric mean with 95% confidence intervals (CI) was used for normality purposes. Treatment effect was measured by the ratio RI<SUB>naftidrofuryl </SUB>/RI<SUB>placebo</SUB>. In addition, we calculated the traditional Cohen's effect size (<LINK REF="REF-Cohen-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cohen 1988</LINK>).</P>
<P>In our main analysis, the PFWD at the end of the study was taken as the final (WD<SUB>f</SUB>) if available, and the LOCF was used if the WD<SUB>f</SUB> was not available. Four studies had their final WD at six months, one at 12 months (<LINK REF="STD-Boccalon-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Boccalon 2001</LINK>) and two at three months (<LINK REF="STD-Kriessman-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Kriessman 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Maass-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Maass 1984</LINK>). The LOCF is an approximation justified by: a) its recommendation in PAD guidelines; b) the short expected follow-up time (six months in general); and c) for a majority of patients the final values were available. In addition, we did summary statistics analysis where we included all intermediate values of the PFWD (often measured at one, three and six months).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Main meta-analysis statistical test based on the geometric means of WD<SUB>f </SUB>and WD<SUB>0</SUB>
</HEADING>
<P>We conducted the analysis in two independent ways: a one-stage approach in which the database was considered as one data set and a two-stage approach in which the aggregated results of each study were pooled and then analyzed with traditional peripheral artery disease meta-analysis (MA-PAD) techniques.</P>
<P>For the ratio RI<SUB>naftidrofuryl </SUB>/ RI<SUB>placebo</SUB> and for effect size we used, in the one-stage approach, the multilevel (patient and trial) general linear mixed model (GLMM) (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2001</LINK>) by considering random treatment effects, fixed-study effects and adjusting for WD0. We conducted a supportive two-stage analysis by calculating aggregate RI estimates for each treatment group within each study followed by a conventional random-effects model (<LINK REF="REF-DerSimonian-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">DerSimonian 1986</LINK>) that is more familiar to clinicians. Our postulated model is based on WD0 covariates, study and treatment factors. Exploratory stepwise research was carried out on all the available predictors (risk factors in particular) to detect the possible existence of additional determinant predictors.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Threshold for significance</HEADING>
<P>The alpha level of error for a significant treatment effect was set at 0.01. We also calculated 95% CIs.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Responder analysis</HEADING>
<P>We also analyzed the data as binary variables. A patient was considered as a responder to therapy when the PFWD improved by at least 50%, from baseline. We estimated the difference in success rates between naftidrofuryl and placebo, the derived number needed to treat (NNT), the relative benefit and the odds ratio (OR). These statistics were calculated with a similar mixed model as above for the one-stage approach, adapted for binary data (<LINK REF="REF-Turner-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Turner 2000</LINK>). For the two-step approach, again we used the random-effects model of DerSimonian and Laird (<LINK REF="REF-DerSimonian-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">DerSimonian 1986</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Secondary outcome measure</HEADING>
<P>For analysis of the maximal walking distance (MWD) data in the trials for which data were available we used the same technique as for PFWD .</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">2. From the IPD</HEADING>
<P>From the IPD, the safety of oral naftidrofuryl was assessed mainly from the mean of the reported adverse events in the naftidrofuryl-treated patients compared with the mean in the placebo group. We extracted data from the source documents, clinical trials or the publications.</P>
<P>We carried out safety analysis from RCTs by estimating the proportion of participants experiencing at least one:</P>
<OL>
<LI>adverse event (AE) at a moderate level;</LI>
<LI>serious cardiovascular AE (including death);</LI>
<LI>serious non-cardiovascular AE;</LI>
<LI>gastric AE.</LI>
</OL>
<P>For each of these events we calculated the relative risk in the naftidrofuryl and placebo groups, calculating the difference for each study and using the DerSimonian and Laird model.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">3. From all trials and from post-marketing surveillance (PMS) and periodic safety update (PSU) reports</HEADING>
<P>From all the studies of naftidrofuryl (22,187 patients), two safety studies were carried out and the upper limit 95% CI of the serious adverse-event incidence was calculated.<BR/>From the PMS and PSU reports provided by the local authorities, the number of treatment years, during the period 1995 to 1998 and 1998 to 2000, and the number of declared serious adverse events, labeled and suspected drug-related reports were calculated.</P>

<P>No additional studies were identified for inclusion or exclusion in this update.</P>
<P>We were able to retrieve from the international library system the original publication of all the trials. Subsequent confirmatory searches, based on this set of 11 trials and 20 reviews, using the "related articles" algorithm in PubMED and a search in the Science Citation Index did not reveal additional references; nor did a request for information to the company and to the authors of the retrieved studies. Our request for IPD data to the authors and to the company resulted in the information, provided by the company, that IPD data for nine of the 11 studies were available.</P>
<P>Of the 11 trials, three were published before 1984, six between 1984 to 2000 and two after 2000. Three trials used obsolete doses of naftidrofuryl, either 100 mg four times daily or 100 mg three times daily, and eight used either 200 mg three times daily or 300 two times daily. One study (<LINK REF="STD-Karnik-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Karnik 1988</LINK>) was a cross-over study. IPD were available from nine studies and covariates from seven studies.</P>

One hundred and eighty-six patients of both sexes, aged between 40 and 70 years with Fontaine stage II PAOD were selected out of 222 recruited patients following a wash-out period of one month. Thirty-six patients were excluded because they did not correspond to the protocol of the trial; 32 patients dropped out of the study because of a variation of PFWD &gt; 20%. After the four-week run-in period patients were divided randomly in two groups: 64 in the treatment group (55 men and nine women) and 54 in the placebo group (50 men and four women). During the four-week run-in period patients received placebo tablets three times daily. Afterwards, patients received naftidrofuryl 200 mg three times daily or an identical placebo tablet for six months. Measurements were taken at days -30, 0, 90 and 180. Pain-free walking distance was measured on a treadmill (3 km/h at 10% elevation). Ankle brachial index was measured by Doppler.

<BR/>This was a double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized trial performed in an ambulatory care setting in France. The outpatients selected were of either sex, aged 40 to 80 years with chronic stable intermittent claudication (&lt; 500 m) and an ankle brachial index (ABI) between 0.60 and 0.90. The patients received naftidrofuryl 200 mg three times daily or placebo for 12 months. They were seen by their general practitioner every three months: M0, M3, M6, M9 and M12; when ABI, tolerance and treatment effects were evaluated. Four visits were to the angiologists' office: M0, M3, M6 and M12; where walking distance was evaluated. The measurement of walking distance was undertaken using a device called the PADHOC (peripheral arterial disease holter control) worn by the patient. This was a registering box attached to a belt and linked to two ultrasonic patches and a command box held in the hand. The principle of the device is the measurement of walking distance and the speed profile in an ambulatory person. One hundred and eighty-two patients were randomized and 168 entered the intention-to-treat analysis.

<BR/>This was a double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized study performed in outpatients recruited from five hospitals in Paris and assessed in one single centre. Outpatients of either sex (80% male, mean age 66.9 years) aged between 35 and 85 years with moderately severe chronic, stable intermittent claudication of at least six months duration and who had been clinically stable during the last three months, with the diagnosis of PAOD confirmed by arteriography or duplex scan, were recruited. All patients had already undergone a course of exercise therapy. Only patients whose PFWD and MWD on the treadmill were between 100 and 300 meters were included in the study. It was also a requirement that the walking distance of the patients did not vary by more than 25% between recruitment and randomization. Of the 221 selected patients, 25 did not satisfy the entry criteria. One hundred and ninety-six patients were randomized following a four-week placebo run-in period to: naftidrofuryl (n = 98) or placebo (n = 98) for six months. The patients were followed up for a further six months after discontinuation of treatment. The two groups were well matched for demographic variables (with the exception of BMI, which was significantly higher in the naftidrofuryl group), risk factors and history of vascular disease. Fifteen patients did not supply any further information after baseline, nine in the naftidrofuryl group and six in the placebo group, leaving 181 who entered the intention-to-treat analysis. A further 29 patients (13 naftidrofuryl, 16 placebo) did not complete the study according to the protocol, which left 152 patients available for the on-treatment analysis. Following the end of the six months treatment phase, a further 18 patients dropped out before the final treadmill test at eight months, leaving 134 patients eligible for the final treadmill test at eight months. The primary outcome measures were PFWD and MWD measured on the treadmill using a constant workload and a specific device which recorded both time and gait (results of the latter measurements are not included in this review). The secondary measures of efficacy were the ABI. These measures were performed at all assessment points before, during and at the end of the active treatment phase and at eight months. Clinical tolerance was assessed at all timepoints. Biological tolerance, in particular measurement of liver and renal function, was also evaluated. <I>IPD sample size: </I>196.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Assessment of methodological quality</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Excluded studies</HEADING>
<P>We graded the trials of <LINK REF="STD-Ruckley-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Ruckley 1978</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Karnik-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Karnik 1988</LINK> as C (high risk of bias) because of problems of internal validity. This evaluation was in line with our previous review (<LINK REF="REF-De-Backer-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">De Backer 2000</LINK>). Two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Clyne-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Clyne 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pohle-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Pohle 1979</LINK>) were excluded, in contrast with evaluation of published results in our previous review. <LINK REF="STD-Pohle-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Pohle 1979</LINK> was excluded because of: incomplete IPD data, bad quality, no availability of covariables and the use of an obsolete drug dosage. The effect size was calculated as 0.63. <LINK REF="STD-Clyne-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Clyne 1980</LINK> was excluded because IPD were only available for 60% of the patients, covariates were not available and an obsolete dosage was used. The effect size was 0.45.</P>
<P>In conclusion, four trials (<LINK REF="STD-Clyne-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Clyne 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Karnik-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Karnik 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pohle-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Pohle 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ruckley-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Ruckley 1978</LINK>) were excluded and the reasons for exclusion are listed in the 'Characteristics of excluded studies' table.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Included studies</HEADING>
<P>We included seven trials, which we graded B (moderate risk of bias). All trials were conducted with a common dosage of 600 mg oral naftidrofuryl daily and were from the period between 1984 and 2001. Individual patient data and covariables were available for all studies (<I>see</I> table 'Characteristics of included studies' and <LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK>).</P>
<P>We did not exclude the trial by Moody et al (<LINK REF="STD-Moody-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Moody 1994</LINK>) as we did in our previous review, because no data on variability were given in the published report. In this review IPD data were available and hence variability could be directly assessed.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Checks for publication bias</HEADING>
<P>The sample size of the included studies ranged from 142 to 235 so no study could be considered as small or large; in statistical terms this is interpreted by the square root of the sample size (11.9 to 15.3). This range is very small, thus funnel plots based on detection of a positive monotonic relationship between relative efficacy and sample size were of limited relevance here.</P>
<P>We did, however, apply a range of techniques to find unpublished trials: searches of trials registers, contacts with other researchers and contact with the manufacturing company. None of these approaches revealed evidence of unpublished studies. In addition, we meticulously reviewed the reference lists of relevant articles to find 'hidden' studies (a process called snowballing). In our literature search, undertaken over 10 years, we did not find any evidence of unpublished studies for naftidrofuryl. This is in contrast with documented publication bias for other products in this field where we did find references in the bibliography to studies which, judging by the abstract, were negative but never published (<LINK REF="REF-De-Backer-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">De Backer 2000</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Data extraction for the IPD meta-analysis</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Access to the original patient data</HEADING>
<P>At our request, the company agreed to provide the IPD data unconditionally. Data were stored in CRFs and in individual databases per study, each with a different computer format. The data were extracted from these study databases and transferred to one common database with a common structure.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Data integrity checks</HEADING>
<P>For data collected from secondary databases, we performed a check against the original CRFs using a military control process 105D (<LINK REF="REF-Mil_x002d_STD-105D" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mil-STD 105D</LINK>). We checked a random subset of 150 values (study, centre, patient number; gender; WD0, WDf; weight (kg) and age (years). We were able to retrieve all data except for the weight values in the Kriessman study and, instead of 150 values, 146 values were available. After comparison of the computer output with the results manually reported by Merck the number of mistakes was 0/146. This test provided some basic evidence of data reliability of at least 99%.</P>
<P>A total of 7.8% of secondary covariables were missing. After analysis these missing data were considered as missing at random and allocated by a full information maximum likelihood procedure (FIML).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Comparison with published results</HEADING>
<P>For each trial and each treatment group we calculated the mean WD0, WDf and difference (WDf-WD0); this was the calculation in all published results. We were able to determine which patients in our pooled database contributed to the results as published, from a selection by study design of the published study (per protocol or rIT). The analyses were originally carried out on a restricted intention-to-treat basis (<LINK REF="STD-Boccalon-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Boccalon 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kieffer-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Kieffer 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moody-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Moody 1994</LINK>) and per protocol for all other studies. This enabled us to check whether the mean values documented in the primary analyses matched with our own results in the pooled IPD database and this check was successful (margin of error less than 1%).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Final decision to proceed with the IPD analysis</HEADING>
<P>Given the limited number of excluded trials, the successful data integrity check and match with the historical data as published and the size of the available pooled database, the authors decided to proceed with the IPD analysis.</P>
<P>There was some debate about two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Boccalon-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Boccalon 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moody-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Moody 1994</LINK>). The latter study (<LINK REF="STD-Moody-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Moody 1994</LINK>) that had been excluded in the previous review was now included because IPD were available. However, we considered the study to be of rather poor quality with regard to internal validity and more than 70% of the patients had a baseline PFWD of &lt; 100 m. Therefore, this study was classified as a supportive study; it was not included in the main analyses and only analyzed in the sensitivity analysis.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Boccalon-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Boccalon 2001</LINK> was considered to be of good quality, complying with the guidelines and internal validity criteria. The variability of the results was not well reported but this could be corrected by the IPD data. The trialists used the non-conventional PADHOC method for measuring walking distance, claimed to represent a higher but more physiological WD0 and WDf. The inclusion of this trial had two consequences. Firstly, it was decided that a sensitivity analysis without the results of this study would be conducted. Secondly, in the main analysis where the Boccalon study was included, results could not be expressed in absolute terms (for example the number of meters gained in WDf - WD0) and were expressed as relative improvement (WDf/WD0).</P>

<P>One thousand, two hundred and sixty-six patients (ITT) constituted the whole database of this IPD meta-analysis (626 placebo, 640 naftidrofuryl); seven studies contributed to the database: <LINK REF="STD-Adhoute-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Adhoute 1986</LINK> (146); <LINK REF="STD-Adhoute-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Adhoute 1990</LINK> (182); <LINK REF="STD-Boccalon-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Boccalon 2001</LINK> (182); <LINK REF="STD-Kieffer-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Kieffer 2001</LINK> (196); <LINK REF="STD-Kriessman-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Kriessman 1988</LINK> (235); <LINK REF="STD-Maass-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Maass 1984</LINK> (142); and <LINK REF="STD-Moody-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Moody 1994</LINK> (183).</P>
<P>The sample was characterized by a mean age of 62.8 years, 18% women, mean body mass index (BMI) 24.78 ± 4.29 kg/m<SUP>2</SUP>, mean systolic blood pressure (SBP) 148.86 ± 21.95 mm Hg, mean ankle brachial index (ABI) 0.65 ± 0.17, mean duration of illness 3.45 ± 3.44 years, 23.4% obese patients, 48% currently smoking, 32.7% hypertensives, 12.6% with angina pectoris, 13.4% type 2 diabetes patients, 38.7% of patients with hyperlipidemia and 43.6% sedentary patients (not performing any physical exercise). As expected, there were important differences among the studies for all these variables (inter-study heterogeneity) but the two treatment groups matched well for each study as well as for the full set.</P>
<P>Final assessment data were available (per protocol) for 896 patients (71%). For 305 patients (24%) at least one assessment after baseline (not final assessment) was available (rIT). For 65 patients (5%) a randomization code was available but no outcome assessment data (ITT).</P>
<P>Details on the reasons for termination of data are given for 370 patients in Additional <LINK REF="TBL-05" TYPE="TABLE">Table 5</LINK> and <LINK REF="TBL-06" TYPE="TABLE">Table 6</LINK>.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Outcome evaluation</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Goodness of fit of the proposed model</HEADING>
<P>We carried out a stepwise linear regression analysis of the WDf as a dependent variable, potential predictors being WD0, risk factors and other covariables (age, sex, duration of illness, obesity, diabetes, sedentary life, hypertension, angina pectoris, smoking, hyperlipemia). The analysis revealed that WD0 was the key predictor (R<SUP>2 </SUP>= 0.479), accounting for almost all the variability of the other baseline predictors.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Main analysis</HEADING>
<P>Details of the relative improvement of PFWD by study and by treatment are given in <LINK REF="TBL-07" TYPE="TABLE">Table 7</LINK>.</P>
<P>The main analysis was carried out on a full ITT basis for all participants of six trials (excluding <LINK REF="STD-Moody-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Moody 1994</LINK>). As explained above, <LINK REF="STD-Moody-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Moody 1994</LINK> was not considered in the main analysis, leaving a total of 1083 patients (531 placebo, 552 naftidrofuryl).</P>
<P>Based on ITT samples of six trials, the main analysis based on RI = WDf/WD0 and secondary analyses on responder rate were carried out in a one-stage multilevel linear mixed model. The treatment effect estimate was RI<SUB>naftidrofuryl</SUB> / RI<SUB>placebo</SUB> 1.37 (95% CI 1.27 to 1.49, P &lt; .001). The unadjusted geometric mean RIs were 1.21 and 1.60 for placebo and naftidrofuryl, respectively.</P>
<P>The treatment effect estimates of the two meta-analytic techniques (one-stage and two-stage conventional random approach) were very similar, with somewhat wider estimates of CI in the two-stage approach (<LINK REF="TBL-08" TYPE="TABLE">Table 8</LINK>).</P>
<P>Our responder analysis identified 30.2% and 54.7% responders for placebo and naftidrofuryl, respectively. The absolute difference in responder rate, or success proportion, was 22.3% (95% CI 17.1 to 27.6). The number needed to treat was 4.48 (95% CI 3.62 to 5.85). Forest plots based on the Peto OR are shown with responder rates for naftidrofuryl over placebo. Additional tables (<LINK REF="TBL-09" TYPE="TABLE">Table 9</LINK>; <LINK REF="TBL-10" TYPE="TABLE">Table 10</LINK>; <LINK REF="TBL-11" TYPE="TABLE">Table 11</LINK>) show the responder analysis.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Heterogeneity</HEADING>
<P>In the two-stage approach, the test for heterogeneity using Peto OR was significant (P &lt; 0.001). Hence we studied the influence of baseline handicap on treatment effect (presented in Additional <LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>). The baseline handicap did not significantly affect the relative improvement (mixed model, P &gt; 0.05), which remained constant for the naftidrofuryl group and the placebo group except for a larger walking distance at baseline where the placebo effect seemed to decrease. The heterogeneity was taken into account in the one-stage approach by using multilevel techniques and in the two-stage approach by using the random-effects model of DerSimonian and Laird (<LINK REF="REF-DerSimonian-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">DerSimonian 1986</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Sensitivity analysis</HEADING>
<P>We carried out various alternative analyses (<LINK REF="TBL-12" TYPE="TABLE">Table 12</LINK>); in particular, adding the excluded study (<LINK REF="STD-Moody-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Moody 1994</LINK>) resulted in a treatment effect estimate with a relative improvement ratio RI<SUB>naftidrofuryl</SUB> / RI<SUB>placebo</SUB> of 1.37 (95% CI 1.28 to 1.48, P &lt;0.001, n = 1266). Eliminating <LINK REF="STD-Boccalon-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Boccalon 2001</LINK> (based on physiological walking distance), the ratio was 1.31 (95% CI 1.24 to 1.39, P &lt; 0.001). In comparing our full intention-to-treat analysis with the per-protocol sample (n = 726), we found a higher value of 1.42 (95% CI 1.22 to 1.65). The LOCF versus summary statistics showed a ratio of 1.37 (95% CI 1.28 to 1.48) versus 1.52 (95% CI 1.44 to 1.62).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Analysis of the secondary outcome</HEADING>
<P>The maximum walking distance (MWD) was determined with the same selection and statistical techniques. This endpoint was not measured in all studies and for some studies only on a subset of patients (n = 968, six studies). The relative improvement was 1.40 (95% CI 1.19 to 1.63) and the responder rate absolute risk difference was 23.9% (95% CI 15.7 to 32.1).</P>

<P>1. <LINK REF="STD-Maass-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Maass 1984</LINK> reported as serious adverse events (SAE): in the naftidrofuryl group one requiring vascular surgery and one stroke during the wash-out period; in the placebo group one embolectomy, one ischialgia (pain in the hip) and one ulcus cruris (foot ulcer). Reported non-serious adverse events were: in the naftidrofuryl group one with nausea plus gastric pain, one urticaria, one dry mouth, one nausea and one loss of body weight; in the placebo group one with urticaria, one nausea and gastric pain. No relevant variations in biological data were detected.</P>
<P>2. <LINK REF="STD-Adhoute-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Adhoute 1986</LINK> reported seven adverse events in the naftidrofuryl group and three in the placebo group. These were mainly gastrointestinal problems. In one patient receiving placebo the gastrointestinal problems were severe enough to discontinue treatment. In both groups laboratory data remained unchanged during the study period.</P>
<P>3. <LINK REF="STD-Kriessman-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Kriessman 1988</LINK> reported serious adverse events for which treatment was discontinued: in the naftidrofuryl group four experienced deterioration of PAOD, two gastric pain and one death with reason unknown; in the placebo group five had deterioration of PAOD, two gastric pain, one fever and one pulmonary disorder. Other adverse events were: in the naftidrofuryl group 14 with gastric disorders, one dry mouth, one skin erythema (reddening of the skin), one articular stiffness, one pressure in the eyes and two with no details given; in the placebo group three experienced gastric disorders, one memory disorder, one sweating, one sleep disturbance, two headaches and three with no details given.</P>
<P>4. <LINK REF="STD-Adhoute-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Adhoute 1990</LINK> reported 27 patients (30%) in the naftidrofuryl group with at least one adverse event. Of these, 20 reported at least one important adverse event and eight reported at least one non-serious adverse event. In the placebo group 31 (34%) patients reported at least one adverse event of which 10 were important, five patients reported at least one non-serious adverse event.</P>
<P>5. <LINK REF="STD-Moody-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Moody 1994</LINK> stated that in the naftidrofuryl group there was one with angina pectoris and one suspected myocardial infarction. In the placebo group one participant experienced acute ischemia followed by bypass surgery, one myocardial infarction and one vascular occlusion followed by angioplasty. In the naftidrofuryl group a higher incidence of minor gastrointestinal symptoms was recorded.</P>
<P>6. <LINK REF="STD-Boccalon-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Boccalon 2001</LINK> found that in the naftidrofuryl group 28 patients (29%) had at least one adverse event versus 15 (17%) in the placebo group during the double-blind treatment period. In the naftidrofuryl group 17 patients (29%) had at least one serious adverse event versus eight (17%) in the placebo group, although this was not statistically significant. This difference is due to hospitalization for various pathologies (eight in the naftidrofuryl group versus three in the placebo group), among other factors. Five deaths occurred during the study (three in the naftidrofuryl group versus two in the placebo group). In the naftidrofuryl group eight non-serious adverse events were reported, mainly gastro-intestinal disorders (four); compared with five in the placebo group.</P>
<P>7. <LINK REF="STD-Kieffer-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Kieffer 2001</LINK> reported that in the naftidrofuryl group 18 patients (18%) experienced one or more adverse events compared with 21 patients (21%) in the placebo group. In the naftidrofuryl group 11%, 12% in the placebo group, reported at least one serious adverse event. No serious adverse event was directly related to the study during the double-blind treatment phase. One patient died in the naftidrofuryl group due to lung cancer. In the naftidrofuryl group nine non-serious adverse events were reported versus 12 in the placebo group. The non-serious adverse event for which a possible relationship with naftidrofuryl existed was one case of digestive disorder.</P>
<P>In summary, there were no significant differences for serious adverse events between naftidrofuryl and placebo. For the non-serious adverse events there was a significantly higher incidence of gastro-intestinal disorders.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">3. From periodic safety update reports (PSUR)</HEADING>
<P>From all the studies of naftidrofuryl (n = 22,187 patients) two safety studies were carried out. The upper limit of serious adverse-event incidence was 1.35 x 10<SUP>-4 </SUP>(1/10,000).</P>
<P>During the period from 1995 to1998 there were 1,224,908 treatment years with 19 labeled adverse events. During the period 1998 to 2000 there were 2,823,546 treatment years with 18 labeled adverse events. These events were mainly gastric disorders. The observed incidence rate was 0.305 x 10<SUP>-5</SUP> and the upper 95% CI was 0.89 x 10<SUP>-5</SUP>, so that the rate of drug-related serious adverse events was likely to be less than 10<SUP>-5</SUP> (1/100,000).</P>
<P>In summary, the few observed lethal or serious adverse events were not considered to be attributable to the treatments either by the investigator or by the sponsor; they either had another cause or were a complication of an underlying disease. Except for gastric disorders, no disorder of other specific organ systems was shown to have a clinically relevant incidence. The analysis of gastric disorders provided a relative risk of 1.75. The incidence of gastric disorders was variable across studies. The maximum incidence, at a 95% CI, of drug-related serious adverse events was 0.89 x 10<SUP>-5</SUP> and essentially consisted of gastric disorders. There were a few reports of neurological or skin adverse reactions from the spontaneous reporting system but the incidence was similar on placebo.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">The evidence base of symptomatic treatment of peripheral arterial occlusive disease (PAD)</HEADING>
<P>In the management of PAD caused by atherosclerosis, risk factor modification plays a crucial role as cardiovascular morbidity and mortality is very high in these patients. All patients with PAD should receive all measures recommended in the secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease. Exercise therapy and smoking cessation are essential elements of the treatment of intermittent claudication from the beginning, both for cardiovascular protection and for the symptomatic treatment of PAD itself.</P>
<P>Although for symptomatic treatment the non-pharmacological measures of "stop smoking and keep walking" are important and efficacious, pharmacological treatment of disabling symptoms could be justified in the management of PAD. If proven efficacious and safe, pharmacological treatment could have a clinically relevant impact on the quality of life and a facilitating effect on exercise therapy. However, the available evidence on the efficacy of pharmaceuticals is limited in this field. There is evidence that statins have a positive effect on symptoms of PAD besides their cardiovascular protective effects (<LINK REF="REF-Aung-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aung 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>A series of drugs labeled as vasoactive agents with differing presumed modes of action have been promoted for symptomatic treatment of peripheral arterial disease. However, no single pharmacological agent has been accepted and used worldwide. These drugs do not replace risk factor modification, lifestyle changes and exercise training programs but they can have a place as adjunctive treatment for those who do not perform well or benefit from exercise therapy or for those who have a contra-indication or no indication (yet) for invasive therapy. Drugs for which no evidence for improving claudication is available are cinnarizine, cyclandelate, nicotinic acid, isoxsuprine (<LINK REF="REF-De-Backer-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">De Backer 2000</LINK>) and omega-3 fatty acids (<LINK REF="REF-Sommerfield-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sommerfield 2007</LINK>). Drugs with a limited number of studies, providing insufficient evidence, are vitamin E (<LINK REF="REF-Kleijnen-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kleijnen 1998</LINK> 1998) and prostanoids (<LINK REF="REF-Reiter-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reiter 2003</LINK>). Drugs for which several studies exist but they are of doubtful quality and insufficiently support claims of efficacy are buflomedil and pentoxifylline (<LINK REF="REF-De-Backer-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">De Backer 2000</LINK>). The use of two pharmacological agents is supported by an evidence base; they have limited efficacy and are mentioned in the European and Transatlantic guidelines. These are cilostazol and naftidrofuryl (<LINK REF="REF-Robless-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Robless 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-SIGN-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">SIGN 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-TASC-II-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">TASC II 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>For cilostazol, a Cochrane review exists based on six RCTs, comparing cilostazol 100 mg twice daily versus placebo. The weighted mean difference (WMD) for the PFWD was 31.1 m (95% C) 21.4 to 40.9). The side effects included headache, diarrhea, peripheral edema and nausea. Cilostazol is contra-indicated in heart failure. There are no data on the reduction of cardiovascular events (<LINK REF="REF-Robless-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Robless 2007</LINK>). For naftidrofuryl, about 20 narrative reviews and one systematic review have been published. However, in the systematic review the authors made the decision not to undertake a meta-analysis, because of the methodological limitations of pooling heterogenous aggregated data. To perform a final decisive evaluation of the efficacy of naftidrofuryl we decided to repeat the analysis on individual patient data within the framework of The Cochrane Collaboration. Health technology assessment in pharmaceuticals is usually limited to new products. An IPD meta-analysis is rarely attempted in clinical pharmacotherapy for new products as the number of pivotal trials is limited in the first phases of the life cycle of a product. With older products it is often too difficult to collect IPD data from trials, especially when the earliest studies were conducted decades ago before the era of Good Clinical Practice (GCP).</P>
<P>Regulatory control of the quality of drugs on the market should not only be limited to new agents and safety issues. When initial claims of efficacy and efficiency of older products are not corroborated as experience accumulates and when research fails to deliver confirmation of effect, marketing should be put into question, even in the absence of safety crises. Authorities should not just wait for the slow relinquishment process of obsolete products or the withdrawal by the manufacturer because the product is no longer economically viable.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Strengths of the IPD</HEADING>
<P>For naftidrofuryl we managed to conduct an IPD meta-analysis based on seven RCTs from a period spanning from 1978 to 2001. The 1266 patients in the IPD database provide a solid basis for analysis. A full intention-to-treat analysis (ITT) was performed where all randomized patients were included irrespective of their outcome. Robust methods for missing endpoint allocation were applied and a common robust measure of central tendency (the geometric mean) was used. As the EMEA guidelines recommend, we chose PFWD as the primary endpoint and MWD as the secondary endpoint (<LINK REF="REF-EMEA" TYPE="REFERENCE">EMEA</LINK>). As individual patient data (IPD) were available, we were able to use both the one-stage and two-stage approach in analyzing results, expressed as continuous and binary data, allowing us to assess the impact of different meta-analytical statistical techniques. Our sensitivity analysis was based on various study exclusions and inclusions and the techniques used pointed out the stability of the results.</P>
<P>Another potential strength of IPD is the ability to perform analyses within different patient subgroups. In this analysis we did a first assessment on the possible influence of covariates by carrying out a stepwise exploratory linear regression in which we entered all covariates (age, gender, duration of illness, risk factors, ABI) and we found that only baseline walking distance (WD0) and treatment effects were useful predictors of the final walking distance, WDf. However, we intend to analyze the data on the influence of covariates (including patient subgroups) on baseline walking distance in another context.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Limitations of this IPD</HEADING>
<P>The outcome in these studies was measured with a standardized treadmill test (in one study with a physiological method, the PADHOC). In some studies graded-load treadmill tests and in other studies constant-load treadmill tests were used. The studies were conducted in a limited number of countries in Europe (UK, France and Germany). The maximal walking distance was not recorded in all studies. For four of the 11 identified trials no or only incomplete IPD were available (two of which had quality flaws serious enough to be excluded). The studies dated from different time periods with intervening major events such as the generalized introduction of Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and changing international guidelines to conduct trials in PAD.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Can these results be trusted ?</HEADING>
<P>The authors were dependent on the goodwill of the marketing authorization holder for access to the data. We found references and full text of all identified studies in the medical literature but for the individual patient data we had to rely on the permission of the company, as the data were not available from the principal investigators. The company, who funded most of the studies in this review, provided the data without preliminary conditions. The meta-analysis in itself was not funded by the company, as directed by The Cochrane Collaboration. Despite precise data integrity checks some uneasiness with regard to the authenticity of the original data remains as some studies date from before the period of the implementation of rigorous GCP checks. Our successful comparison of the per protocol and restricted ITT data in our database with the published results provided reassurance in this regard.</P>
<P>Despite searching since 1997 for unpublished trials carried out at any time in the past, uncertainty about publication bias remains. It is still possible that trials were executed, analyzed and hidden because of negative results. Unfortunately, classical numerical tests for publication bias can hardly be applied in this meta-analysis because the number of trials is small and with little range in the sample size. Funnel plots based on detection of a positive monotonic relationship between relative efficacy and sample size are of limited relevance here. The only possible check in this context would be to examine the relationship of relative efficacy across the time when these trials were conducted, with the underlying assumption that early trials might show a better efficacy than more recent trials since the historical early studies could be expected to have less scientific rigor or due to the phenomenon of 'fading of reported effectiveness' (<LINK REF="REF-Gehr-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gehr 2006</LINK>). In our analysis the findings were that the expected efficacy does not manifestly decrease from older to more recent historical studies.</P>
<P>Our results could be affected by choices made in the inclusion and exclusion of trials and the subsequent quality evaluation of included trials. We excluded four studies. Two had serious flaws in quality, three had an obsolete dosage of 100 mg once daily and IPD data were not available or incomplete for all of these four studies. The excluded trials had an effect size of 0.45 (<LINK REF="STD-Clyne-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Clyne 1980</LINK>), 0.63 (<LINK REF="STD-Pohle-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Pohle 1979</LINK>), 1.11 (<LINK REF="STD-Karnik-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Karnik 1988</LINK>) and 1.25 (<LINK REF="STD-Ruckley-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Ruckley 1978</LINK>), while the overall effect size of the included studies was 0.54 (<LINK REF="TBL-18" TYPE="TABLE">Table 18</LINK>). Hence, it is unlikely that the exclusion of these trials have inflated the results.</P>
<P>We conducted sensitivity analyses which showed that the inclusion or exclusion of the studies by <LINK REF="STD-Moody-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Moody 1994</LINK> (with a majority of patients with very high disease severity at baseline) and Boccalon (using a physiological instead of standardized outcome measure) did not affect the conclusions in a meaningful way.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Clinical relevance</HEADING>
<P>The question is whether our statistically significant results are clinically relevant.<B> </B>The geometric mean of the relative improvement was 1.60 for naftidrofuryl and 1.21 for placebo. There is an absence of interaction of baseline severity with treatment, which means that the efficacy of the treatment remains constant irrespective of the magnitude of the baseline handicap. We set the threshold for response at 50% improvement. One could argue that a 100% improvement is needed. Although somewhat arbitrary, the value of 50% improvement is based on the rationale that above a baseline walking distance of 200 meters (the average of our database) an improvement of 50% is at least 100 meters, a value considered as clinically meaningful to help maintain essential activities of daily living (<LINK REF="REF-D_x0027_Hooge-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">D'Hooge 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>In this analysis little attention was paid to baseline risk factors. It is known that PAD is strongly affected by smoking and sedentary lifestyle. The effect of physical exercise on walking distance improvement has been widely demonstrated but one key question remains, does a particular drug have a positive or synergistic interaction with physical exercise? Today the regulatory authorities require not only that the physicians motivate their patients to improve lifestyle conditions but also constrains the drug manufacturer to show that the effect of the studied drug is not simply suppressed when a patient modifies his or her lifestyle. This is the key question in PAD therapy and is apparently without an answer today. The question is difficult as it requires longitudinal recording of smoking habits and exercise and a methodological solution to disentangle the pharmacological effects and the lifestyle change effects.<BR/>
<BR/>Based on the response analysis, a number needed to treat of 4.48 (95% CI 3.62 to 5.85) was calculated, which may be considered as an acceptable result for symptomatic treatment. Our results on maximal walking distance (MWD) corroborated the results with pain-free walking distance (PFWD) as an outcome. In the results of previously published individual trials often a significant difference was found for PFWD but not for MWD. In fact, there are few scientific arguments to favor one measurement over the other. However, historically PFWD data are more readily available. Walking distance improvement consists of the relief of a symptom considered as an important impairment because it has a causal effect on disability, reduces the activities of daily living that are linked with a person's autonomy and influences social life, role achievements, mood and quality of life (<LINK REF="REF-D_x0027_Hooge-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">D'Hooge 2001</LINK>).<BR/>

</B>In a previous consensus conference on oral vasoactive medication for intermittent claudication that was organized by our group, we and a panel of general practitioners, medical specialists, pharmacists, nurses, health insurers and patients concluded that priority should be given to financing health education and patient education programs (prevention, rehabilitation, physical exercise) rather than spending resources on vasoactive medications. A cost-benefit study should now be performed for naftidrofuryl (currently sold at a cost of approximately one Euro a day).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Safety</HEADING>
<P>Based on the published reports and the IPD of adverse events in the included RCTs, and on the periodic safety update reports from post-marketing surveillance, naftidrofuryl seems to be a well-tolerated oral treatment with side effects limited to minor gastric symptoms (for example esophagitis, diarrhea).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Was it worth the effort?</HEADING>
<P>IPD meta-analyses generally necessitate a huge effort for collecting data, and this analysis was no exception. In the future when company data from pivotal trials are archived in a standardized way and made available for independent researchers, it will be easier to conduct IPD analyses.</P>
<P>We were able to model the PFWD final value by adjusting for baseline PFWD because we included a covariance analysis, not simply a mean change, and assessed treatment effect under an appropriate multi-level mixed model that accounted for study effect. We were also able to include data from two trials with poorly published results on variability. The IPD allowed us to provide a uniform calculation of endpoint measurement (relative improvement) for all randomized patients and to apply statistical techniques which take into account inter-study heterogeneity. Hence, the analysis led to a clear conclusion, permitting us to resolve continuing uncertainty about the efficacy of the pharmacological approach to symptomatic treatment in PAD with naftidrofuryl. It kept us from throwing out the baby with the bath water, by discarding the group of vasoactive drugs as a whole.</P>
<P>We enlarged the results through a systematic intention-to-treat approach; the results of our main analysis using a full intention to treat (RI 1.37, 95% CI 1.27 to 1.49) differ from the per-protocol analysis (RI 1.42, 95% CI 1.22 to 1.65; n = 726), which is a higher value (<LINK REF="TBL-12" TYPE="TABLE">Table 12</LINK>). Hence, the IPD meta-analysis resulted in a more conservative but more robust estimate of the effect. Now that this database is constructed, additional interesting research questions could be explored, such as unravelling the effects of covariates on disease severity, subgroup analyses and time-to-event analyses. From a methodological point of view, a more thorough comparison of the results of the one-stage and two-stage approaches for the different expressions of outcome could be interesting.</P>

<P>Naftidrofuryl has a statistically significant and clinically meaningful, although moderate effect compared with placebo for improving walking distance in intermittent claudication in the first six months after initiation of therapy. Lifestyle changes such as stopping smoking, physical exercise and use of antiplatelet drugs remain cornerstones in the prevention and treatment of PAD and should accompany symptomatic drug prescription.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Besides registries of randomized controlled trials, we should have repositories of data from pharmacological trials that are suitable for individual patient data (IPD) analysis. Raw data should be available to the principal investigators, regulatory authorities and researchers, with due consideration of patient privacy. In addition, regular formal appraisal of the balance of risk and benefit is needed for older products. </P>

<P>Study design: double-blind placebo-controlled, randomized multicenter trial in hospitalized and ambulatory care settings in France. Measurements were done at days -30, 0, 90, and 180. PFWD was measured by treadmill (3 km/h at 10% elevation). ABI was measured by Doppler. Clinical compliance and tolerance were measured at each visit.</P>
</CHAR_METHODS>
<CHAR_PARTICIPANTS MODIFIED="2012-11-08 08:55:58 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Heather  Maxwell">
<P>Publication: 186 patients of both sexes between 40 and 70 years with Fontaine stage II PAOD were selected out of 222 recruited patients during a wash-out period of 1 month. 36 patients were excluded because they did not correspond to the protocol of the trial, 32 patients dropped out of the study (variation PFWD &gt; 20%). After a 4-week run-in period patients were divided randomly in 2 groups: 64 in treatment group (55 men and 9 women) and 54 in placebo group (50 men and 4 women).<BR/>IPD: 146 patients.</P>

<CHAR_INTERVENTIONS MODIFIED="2008-05-07 11:18:14 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather  Maxwell">
<P>During the 4-week run-in period, patients received placebo tablets TID followed by either naftidrofuryl 200 mg TID or an identical placebo tablet for 6 months.</P>
</CHAR_INTERVENTIONS>
<CHAR_OUTCOMES MODIFIED="2012-11-08 11:03:52 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Heather  Maxwell">

<P>Study design: double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial in 5 hospitals in Paris but assessed at a single centre. The primary outcome measures of efficacy were PFWD distance and MWD measured on the treadmill using a constant workload and using a specific device which recorded both time and gait (results of the latter measurements are not included in this paper). The secondary measure of efficacy were ankle-brachial indices. All these measures were performed at all assessments points before, during and at the end of active treatment phase, as well as 8 months. Clinical tolerance was assessed at all time points.
