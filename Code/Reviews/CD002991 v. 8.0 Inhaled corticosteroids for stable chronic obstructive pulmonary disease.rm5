I have accepted them all except for clarifying that we need more research on the dose-response of ICS on treatment effects on COPD patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are happy with this we can proceed to copy-editing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Chris&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;15/5/2012&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi Emma and Chris, thanks very much for the Reviewers&amp;#8217; comments, which have been very helpful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have addressed each of these, as below:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Reviewer 1&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1) Q: Are the recommendations for further research appropriate? They need to suggest that studies on dose-response of ICS are undertaken. There are almost no data on different doses as usually the&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;maximum recommended dose is used.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Response&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;: Thank you for this comment. The suggestion for dose-response studies was stated in the original version of the review, and was based on whether side effects could be reduced and yet efficacy maintained, at a lower dose. We agree that many studies have used maximum doses of ICS, so we have now removed the statement about dose and have kept in the question about duration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Original&lt;/i&gt;: What dose and duration of inhaled steroids provides benefit in COPD patients?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Revision&lt;/i&gt;: What duration of inhaled steroids provides benefit in COPD patients?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8216;(&lt;u&gt;dose and&lt;/u&gt;&amp;#8217; removed)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Implications for Research)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2) Q: Do the authors refer to other relevant work?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes. It may be worth discussing Suissa's work in more detail, as he showed that the apparent reduction in exacerbations may be an artefact and explained by withdrawal of ICS in the previously steroid-treated patients put on placebo (steroid withdrawal). In steroid-na&amp;#239;ve patients he found no effect of ICS on exacerbations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Response&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;: Thank you for this suggestion. We have now also discussed Dr Suissa&amp;#8217;s ERJ 2008 paper (Suissa S, Ernst P, Vandemheen KL, Aaron SD. Methodological Issues in Therapeutic Trials of COPD. European Respiratory Journal 2008: 31(5): 927-933) in which these principles are outlined.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Revision&lt;/i&gt;: &lt;u&gt;Other methodological issues raised included the discontinuation of ICS in patients who are already taking these prior to commencement of a trial, and lack of complete follow-up of exacerbations on an intention-to-treat basis in those participants who have withdrawn from the study (Suissa 2008a), which could both overestimate the observed benefits of ICS.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Even&lt;/u&gt; taking into account these issues, and &lt;u&gt;also&lt;/u&gt; the lack of available data to pool in some of the medium and long term studies, our systematic review has observed a statistically significant reduction in the mean exacerbation rate per year with ICS. The magnitude of the effect is relatively small yet potentially important, given that frequent exacerbations worsen lung function decline (Kanner 2001; Donaldson 2002; Vestbo 2011) and reduce quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Discussion: Section on exacerbations)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Reviewer 2&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1) I think issue of QOL could be expanded upon. ICS Slow rate of decline but not clinically significantly in one year. Is rate linear so that it takes only 2 to be meaningful - or can't we tell that? - does it continue ? For duration of study etc etc&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Response&lt;/i&gt;: These are interesting issues to consider. Our pooled analysis combines QOL data in large studies of one to three years duration. Whilst it is not possible to definitely plot the rate of decline of QOL each year, without individual patient data or more data from the studies, inspection of the mean rates of decline of QOL in the cited studies appear approximately linear. We have therefore added the following:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Revision: &lt;i&gt;The effect on quality of life appeared linear, based on graphical analysis of change in quality of life scores in each study (data not shown).&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Discussion: Section on quality of life).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2) Plots are inconsistent with variable labelling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Response&lt;/i&gt;: The forest plots for all comparisons appear to be consistent with direction of effects. (We would value Emma double-checking the graph labels).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you again for this opportunity to respond to the Reviewers&amp;#8217; comments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ian&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ian's responses to Chris's comments:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi Ian,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Comment 1&lt;/b&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think there may be an error in Calverley 2003b in the GIV&lt;br&gt;exacerbations, as the direction is the opposite between Figures 5 and 6.&lt;br&gt;Could you check and amend please? What does GIV add if all the same&lt;br&gt;studies are used in both Forest plots. Could we remove the GIV here, do&lt;br&gt;you think?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;IY response&lt;/b&gt;: Thanks Chris. Table 3 (from 2003 Calverley, attached) shows that BUD (B) had mean exacerbation rate per pt per year of 1.60, compared to Placebo (P) of 1.80, giving mean rate difference of -0.2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Toby had helped us to calculate that SEM from 2003 Calverley. The P value for B vs P was 0.308. Toby used his P value table to calculate that the SEM was 0.195 (which was close to the 0.196 that I had calculated from Toby&amp;#8217;s P value table). N=257 + N=256 for the two groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So our GIV for Calverley 2003 shows mean -0.2, SE 0.195, N=257, N=256.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Comparison 1.5 shows this for Calverley 2003b, with means all to the left, favouring ICS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Please note that in Comparison 1.6, Schermer&amp;#8217;s results lie on the right, favouring placebo (unlike the other studies). This is from their Table 3, and the Table legend also states that the fluticasone group had a higher exacerbation rate than placebo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are slightly different studies in the Forest plots of Comparisons 1.5 and 1.6, and so we would favour keeping these both in. This also helps to respond to any arguments about how to tackle analysis of exacerbations (e.g. from Dr Suissa).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;CJC reply: Thanks my mistake in confusing Schermer in Figure 6 with Calverley 2003b in Figure 5, quite agree about keeping both Figure 5 and 6! Sorry....&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Comment 2&lt;/b&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The other comment relates to rate of decline and the early benefits of&lt;br&gt;ICS on outcomes. Could this be made crystal clear? Does the rate of&lt;br&gt;change that you have shown for FEV1 and SGRQ include initial benefit or&lt;br&gt;just the slope of the fall thereafter? (Emma: Chris said you had done&lt;br&gt;this in the discussion, but not in the abstract, so could you just make&lt;br&gt;sure it's a consistent explanation throughout).&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;IY response&lt;/b&gt;: Good point. All the SGRQ outcomes in the &amp;gt;6 mth studies are for the total duration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similarly for FEV1 in the &amp;gt;6mth studies. Have rechecked the FEV1 decline analyses in the papers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Comparison 1.1:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LHS &amp;#8211; calculated over entire study&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vestbo &amp;#8211; over entire study&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Weir &amp;#8211; over entire study&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Burge &amp;#8211; over entire study&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Van Grunsven &amp;#8211; over entire study&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Comparison 1.2:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Schemer &amp;#8211; over entire study&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shaker &amp;#8211; over entire study&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Calverley &amp;#8211; over entire study&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Others, as above&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Discussion describes a small initial benefit for FEV1 &amp;#160;&amp;#8211; this is inferred from the small &amp;lt;6 months studies, some of which showed a benefit (and also from the Soriano meta-analysis, which had individual patient data).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However the long term decline, from baseline to end of study, did not consistently differ between ICS and placebo. Have made changes in the Lung Function section of the Discussion to make this clearer. The Abstract and Conclusions still stand (these only refers to long term decline in FEV1). The Results present FEV1 decline in long term studies (inconsistent results) and medium term studies (small benefit).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;CJC: Thanks all changes accepted.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Comment 3&lt;/b&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, why do you call the risk of pneumonia &amp;quot;possible&amp;quot;. This is the&lt;br&gt;main new finding of the update and is statistically significant!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;IY response&lt;/b&gt;: Thanks Chris &amp;#8211; &amp;#8216;possibly&amp;#8217; has now been removed!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;CJC: Thanks all changes accepted.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a great update, nearly there!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thanks,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Chris&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;CJC Stats check 6/2/2012&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hi Ian,&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;I think there may be an error in Calverley 2003b in the GIV exacerbations, as the direction is the opposite between Figures 5 and 6. Could you check and amend please? What does GIV add if all the same studies are used in both Forest plots. Could we remove the GIV here, do you think?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The other comment relates to rate of decline and the early benefits of ICS on outcomes. Could this be made crystal clear? Does the rate of change that you have shown for FEV1 and SGRQ include initial benefit or just the slope of the fall thereafter?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Finally, why do you call the risk of pneumonia &amp;quot;possible&amp;quot;. This is the main new finding of the update and is statistically significant! Shouldn't it be in what's new also?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;This is a great update, nearly there!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Thanks,&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Chris&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ian&amp;#8217;s responses 22/1/2012 &lt;/b&gt;EMMA RESPONSE 26/01/2012&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emma: &lt;b&gt;Forest plots&lt;/b&gt;: there is no data in the following analyses, therefore they should be deleted 4.2 to 4.7, 4.9-4.10, 4.12-4.15, 4.17 - 4.24. Comparison 5&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IY: Thanks, deleted empty analysis 4.2 to 4.7, 4.9-4.10, 4.12-4.15, 4.17 - 4.23, and Comparison 5. Kept 4.24 which had one study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;EJW GREAT!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emma: I have activated some of the &lt;b&gt;headings&lt;/b&gt; and cut and paste a few sentences using tracked changed. However the following need to be address or the headings turned of please&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IY: turned off some headings in the Methods. If you&amp;#8217;d like me to reactivate these and include text, please let me know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;EJW; GREAT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emma:'assessment of reporting biases': I suggest the inclusion of a sentence saying you plan to create a funnel plot of you are able to meta-analyse ten or more trials&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IY: Thanks, added: A funnel plot of studies will be created if 10 or more trials are included in any single meta-analysis comparison.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emma: please briefly summarise the risk of bias across domains in the risk of bias section&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IY: Now summarised, thanks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emma: Again, I think it would be too much effort to try and re-write the discussion under the recommended headings. however, I have left the headings activated in case you would like to add anything about potential biases in the review process etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IY: Whilst the headings are useful (and we&amp;#8217;ll use these for new reviews), I think we&amp;#8217;ve totally integrated all of these within the existing Discussion paragraphs, which were ordered by outcomes/comparisons, rather than these new headings. Hope that will be fine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#160;EJW: THANKS FOR THIS - WE'LL LEAVE IT AS IS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emma: &lt;b&gt;Risk of bias&lt;/b&gt; - need to write something in every box in the RoB table - otherwise the corresponding block in the figure doesn't get coloured in - there are a few missing if you look at the figure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IY: now completed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emma: *&lt;b&gt;Celli 2008&lt;/b&gt; is a subgroup analysis of TORCH and therefore this reference should be grouped along with TORCH and the data should all be reported as TORCH. When you make this change, don't forget to copy the data in the forest plots from Celli to TORCH before deleting the reference otherwise you'll lose the data!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IY: data relabelled at TORCH (Calverley). Celli removed as a &amp;#8216;separate&amp;#8217; included study, and just remains included under TORCH.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#160;EJW BRILLIANT THANKS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emma: Finally, there are quite a few errors and warning in the &lt;b&gt;validation report&lt;/b&gt;. I would be grateful if you could run the validation report and make the changes. I you click on &amp;quot;File &amp;gt; reports &amp;gt; validation report&amp;quot; a list of errors and warning will come up. if you click on the hyperlink, it usually takes you to the point in the review where you need to make a change - if something doesn't make sense or you are not sure how to fix it, let me know!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IY: Have amended most of the errors. Haven&amp;#8217;t yet renumbered, or removed subgroups &amp;#8211; please go ahead and do this if needed (I didn&amp;#8217;t want to upset the comparison numbering order). Also, haven&amp;#8217;t renumbered the links to the Figures in the text &amp;#8211; is there a simple way of doing this?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;EJW; I THINK I'VE SORTED THIS OUT NOW - THE LINKS TO ANALYSES AUTOMATICALLY UPDATE. THIS WILL BE FULLY DOUBLE CHECKED DURING COPY EDITING, SO DON'T THINK IT'S WORTH CHECKING SUPER CAREFULLY RIGHT NOW, in the end only needed to move fig 6 up to the top!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emma's notes 20/12/2011&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thank you for your work on the review update. we decided it was not sensible to rearrange the forest plots as per initial discussion - which would seem to be more effort than it is worth. As you may realise, the layout of the review is not quite the same as the current recommendations. This is always an issue in updating reviews and in this case, we feel that it would be, again, more effort than it is worth to re-write your review to take account of the new headings. The main thing is that the content is accurate and that the information is clear - and that you have updated the risk of bias to the new tool which is excellent - thanks!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First off, I had a quick flick through the review to check the tracked changes and accepted them all bar one in the methods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I would be grateful if you could attend to the following points:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Forest plots: there is no data in the following analyses, therefore they should be deleted 4.2 to 4.7, 4.9-4.10, 4.12-4.15, 4.17 - 4.24. Comparison 5&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have activated some of the headings and cut and paste a few sentences using tracked changed. However the following need to be address or the headings turned of please&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;'assessment of reporting biases': I suggest the inclusion of a sentence saying you plan to create a funnel plot of you are able to meta-analyse ten or more trials&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;please briefly summarise the risk of bias across domains in the risk of bias section&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Again, I think it would be too much effort to try and re-write the discussion under the recommended headings. however, I have left the headings activated in case you would like to add anything about potential biases in the review process etc.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Risk of bias - need to write something in every box in the RoB table - otherwise the corresponding block in the figure doesn't get coloured in - there are a few missing if you look at the figure.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;*Celli 2008 is a subgroup analysis of TORCH and therefore this reference should be grouped along with TORCH and the data should all be reported as TORCH. When you make this change, don't forget to copy the data in the forest plots from Celli to TORCH before deleting the reference otherwise you'll lose the data!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Finally, there are quite a few errors and warning in th validation report. I would be grateful if you could run the validation report and make the changes. I you click on &amp;quot;File &amp;gt; reports &amp;gt; validation report&amp;quot; a list of errors and warning will come up. if you click on the hyperlink, it usually takes you to the point in the review where you need to make a change - if something doesn't make sense or you are not sure how to fix it, let me know!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks you for your hard work in updating this review. Once you have made the changes in light of the comments above, please submit it for editorial review again and we will arrange peer review.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-------------------------&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CJC sign off Jan 17 2007&lt;br&gt;Thanks for the responses and changes made. I have made a minor alteration to the last sentence in the reviewers' conclusions on the basis of a late response from a third peer reviewer. Undefined long term adverse events cannot be balanced so I have just stated that they are unknown!&lt;br&gt;This is now ready for submission&lt;br&gt;Great review&lt;br&gt;Chris.&lt;br&gt;=======================================================&lt;br&gt;3/1/2007&lt;br&gt;Peer Review 1:&lt;br&gt;PR1 I find that there could be less focus on short-term studies as ICS are never used short-term in COPD anyway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IY1 Thank you very much for the helpful feedback. We have purposefully included all relevant short term studies, since:&lt;br&gt;(a)We applied the standard Cochrane systematic review methodology, using a comprehensive search,&lt;br&gt;(b)None of the previously published reviews has critiqued any of these short term studies, so we felt they were important to include in this review, and&lt;br&gt;(c)The short term studies were the ones that initially sparked the interest in ICS, that drove the development and planning of the subsequent long term studies.&lt;br&gt;If the editors and reviewers are comfortable with this, we would like to keep the current detail about the short term reviews (and in comparison, greater detail has been given to the more important medium and long term studies).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PR2 There is a lack of analyses stratified on severity of COPD (based on FEV1) as this has previously been shown to be a marker of efficacy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IY2 We agree that stratification by FEV1 would be an excellent approach, if individual patient data were available. Unfortunately we don't have access to these data. The alternative - stratifying each study by mean FEV1 of its subjects - is not as feasible, since:&lt;br&gt;(a)The relatively few long term studies (n=5 for decline data, n=5 for exacerbations, n=8 for mortality) makes the stratification less meaningful,&lt;br&gt;(b)The number of subjects becomes much smaller for each subgroup, reducing the power of these comparisons, and importantly,&lt;br&gt;(c)There was generally a wide range of baseline FEV1 % predicted in each study, so that many subjects may be misclassified in this broad stratification approach. e.g. a study could be classified as 'severe' COPD, whereas a substantial proportion of its subjects may have in fact had 'moderate' COPD.&lt;br&gt;If the reviewers and editors strongly favour stratification, then we will proceed with this. However, we feel that stratifying by individual patient data would be much a more valid approach, if such data were available (especially since there are other equally important factors that should be adjusted for at the same time as adjusting for baseline FEV1 of the individual subject, including smoking status, dose and duration of inhaled steroid, age, gender etc). As mentioned, this is beyond the scope of the review, due to the lack of availability of individual patient data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PR3 Reviewers' Conclusions I find the sentence &amp;quot;Inhaled steroids do not alter the risk of having at least one COPD exacerbation in the medium term.&amp;quot; of little help. I guess the authors make this conclusion based on medium term studies but it does not read well when comparing with the overall conclusion on exacerbations (which also involves exacerbations 'in the medium term').&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IY3 Thank you for this helpful comment. To avoid confusion, we have now deleted this statement about the medium term only studies from the first paragraph of the Discussion, since it does not follow on well after the statement about benefit in long term studies. We have also removed it from the Implications for Practice section at the conclusion (deleted 'Inhaled steroids do not alter the risk of having at least one COPD exacerbation in the medium term').&lt;br&gt;This comment about the medium term studies was initially made for completeness; however, we agree that the statement about the long term studies is more clinically relevant since these long term studies had a greater total sample size and longer duration of clinical follow-up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Peer Review 2:&lt;br&gt;PR4 An issue that is not discussed is the dose-response to inhaled corticosteroids; as far as I am aware no dose response has ever been done and almost every trial uses the maximum recommended dose (apart from Calverley 2003b). Perhaps this should be stated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IY4 This is an interesting comment, and we have now included this in the Interpretation section of the Discussion as 'Interestingly, dose-response to inhaled steroids in COPD has not been systematically tested, and the majority of studies have used high doses.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PR5 Recommendations for further research ? Perhaps discuss more research trying to elucidate the mechanism for the poor response to corticosteroids and to discuss potential strategies for reversing steroid resistance (such as theophylline).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IY5 Thank you for the excellent suggestion, which has now been included in the Implications for Research section, as 'What are the mechanisms for the variable response to inhaled steroids in COPD patients and what are the potential strategies for reversing steroid resistance?'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PR6 This is a very good and comprehensive review and makes sensible conclusions based on the evidence. This review is very much needed as many reviews in the literature appear to have a biased interpretation favouring Big Pharma. There are two small studies that I think could be included: V. M. Keatings, A. Jatakanon, Y. M. Worsdell, and P. J. Barnes. Effects of inhaled and oral glucocorticoids on inflammatory indices in asthma and COPD. Am J Respir Crit Care Med 155:542-548, 1997. (shows that inhaled budesonide did not reduce inflammatory cells and cytokines; the study was double blind and controlled)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IY6 Thank you for this excellent study. Whilst a very important study, two of us had independently assessed this as single-blind in the clinical phase (as stated on Page 543 of the Methods of the paper) and was therefore excluded as it did not quite meet the pre-set double-blind inclusion criteria. For completeness, we have listed this study in the Excluded Studies list, with the comment 'Excluded: sequential single blind, 2 week crossover study of BUD in COPD patients, with double-blind assessment of inflammatory markers. Demonstrated no improvement in lung function, symptom scores or inflammatory indices.' This is to allow a comment to be recorded about the results of this study, even though it was not fully included. We note that the Keatings et al study was cited in the systematic review by Gan 2005 (which included single blind and double blind studies - we have commented on the Gan 2005 review in the Discussion).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PR7 A. Papi, M. Romagnoli, S. Baraldo, F. Braccioni, I. Guzzinati, M. Saetta, A. Ciaccia, and L. M. Fabbri. Partial reversibility of airflow limitation and increased exhaled NO and sputum eosinophilia in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Am J Respir Crit Care Med 162:1773-1777, 2000. (showed that exhaled NO was increased in the patients with more bronchodilator reversibility and also correlated with whether they had increased sputum eosinophils, which in turn predict whether there is a response to inhaled corticosteroids.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IY7 Thank you for this interesting study, which two of us had excluded as it was not an RCT. As discussed in the Predictors of Response to inhaled steroids in the Results section, some RCTs have considered bronchodilator reversibility and sputum eosinophilia as predictors, and the results have been inconsistent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IY8 In addition, based on recommendations from the Editor previously, we have also removed the P values from the Abstract (and kept in the 95% confidence intervals and number of participants for each result, as previously advised).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;=====================================================================&lt;br&gt;CJC Editing Dec 19 2006&lt;br&gt;Thanks for re-ordering the outcomes in Metaview and turning off totals for zero outcomes. Also for removing P values and fixing the links. I have softened the reviewers' conclusion to &amp;quot;Have not been shown to &amp;quot; in view of the width of the CI. This can now go for peer review&lt;br&gt;Chris.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;=========================================================================&lt;br&gt;Questions/replies for Toby to comment on:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Changes made by TJL to data 100605):&lt;br&gt;TJL 1 Have been through search results from October 2004 &amp;amp; added two new studies (Calverley 2003b &amp;amp; Rennard 2001).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;*IY: With Calverley 2003b and Rennard 2001, which are both abstracts, do we try to include any study characteristics in Included Studies? Will need to contact the authors for more details about the studies.*&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TJL: Yes - although the Rennard 2001 data are now available as pdf (see unpublished data attached).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TJL 2 Entered N exacerbations for Hanania (Comparison 02; outcome 14 - data taken from pdf; 'any exacerbation').&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;*IY: Thanks, agree*&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;TJL 3 Entered mean difference &amp;amp; 95% CI estimate for Mahler 2002 change in post-BD FEV1 (Comparison 02; outcome 28 - data taken from published paper: 0.11 , P&amp;lt;0.05).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;*IY: Thanks. The difference of 101 for F versus P is listed in Table 2 of Mahler 2002 (Page 1086). Was the SE in unpublished data that you received, or did you estimate it from graphs?*&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TJL: This was provided by AZ. Mahler data also available as pdf (see attached)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;TJL 4 Entered estimate of mean difference in change from baseline in QoL for Calverley 2003s (BUD) (Comparison 03; outcome 35 - mean difference taken from published paper and SEM taken from Combined steroid/LABA review for difference between BDF &amp;amp; BUD and BDF &amp;amp; PLA).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;*IY: Thanks.*&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;TJL 5 Entered estimate for Calverley 2003a for mean n exacerbations per year (Comparison 03; outcome 37 - data taken from P value and mean difference reported in published paper)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;*IY: Thanks, from Calverley 2003a, Table 3 (B minus placebo).*&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;*IY: How did you work out the SEM from the P value of 0.308 in their Table 3? Please send me the Excel calculator for that!*&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TJL: This is calculated by working backwards from the P value. Essentially this represents the confidence with which we can reject the null hypothesis. So, in other words this tells us how precise the difference is between two means. The precision of the difference then gives us the SE, and from there we can get a mean difference and its associated 95% CI. See Excel spreadsheet attached.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TJL 6 Entered data for Calverley 2003b change in FEV1 post BD (Comparison 02; 28 - data taken from mean difference and reported P value in abstract)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;*IY: Thanks, same question as for P value calculation of SEM above in TJL5. NB You entered the data to Comparison 02-28 in the 2 to 6 month studies. As Calverley 2003b was 52 weeks, should this be in the &amp;gt;6 month studies? Also for RevMan Comparison 02-14: removed from this 2 to 6 month grouping. Have not entered anywhere in RevMan for the time being.*&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;See above&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TJL 7 Entered data for exacerbations for Calverley 2003b (Comparison 02; 13 - data taken from percentages published in abstract)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;*IY: Thanks, data in Comparison 02; 14.*&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;TJL 8 Entered data for pre-dose FEV1 (higher dose from Rennard 2001, Comparison 02; 32 - data taken from published abstract). The addition of these data give a high degree of heterogeneity - both Fixed and Random Effects modelling gave significant results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;*IY: Thanks, only FP 500 vs placebo comparison used (not FP 250 vs placebo)*&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;TJL 9: 39 studies (105 references) included.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;*IY: How do you easily calculate this? Or do you actually count all of them one-by-one? I have entered all of them to the Excel file to count, and have amended with the revised number in the text.*&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TJL: Not easily counted I'm afraid. If we had used something like ProCite this information would have been generated easily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TJL 10 I have added some text on change in quality of life data. There is a need to distinguish between significant within group improvement, and a slower rate of deterioration over the longer term. Can we realistically expect ICS to maintain improvements in QoL for the rest of somebody's life...? I have moved the change data for Burge out of the SGRQ outcome as the difference reflects rate of decline and not mean change from baseline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;*IY: Thanks, agree.*&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;*IY 11: Thanks for entering all those affiliated studies e.g. for Calverley 2003 - all the abstracts and related articles. Great detail - did you copy and paste all those in from the search?! (or did you import from your review?)*&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TJL: A work of patience and extensive attention to detail I'm afraid. The Sistine chapel took less time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;*IY 12: Re: your suggestions for the Review text:*&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Statistical considerations - Page 4: why Fixed effect WMD, whereas we are using a random effects model?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TJL: That old chestnut&amp;#8230;..random effects modelling could be the default if you wanted. I retained fixed effect due to force of habit I'm afraid - it is the only way to diagnose publication bias for funnel plots. There is no consensus on what is right and wrong with that. Some statisticians only think you should use RE because FE is too bombastic. Others abhor the notion of using RE because it gives undue weight to studies that aren't very good. I think much depends on the extent of heterogeneity, since RE and FE will give you the same result where I square is 0% (that's to say there is no statistically significant heterogeneity).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Description of studies, Page 4: TJL: Ian - I think that you can put these data into an additional table and reference it as 'Search history detail'. This provides an opportunity for those who are keen for these data to be reported to go after it!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;*IY 13: great idea, new table inserted.*&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Participants, Page 5: TJL: Mean baseline FEV1 % predicted was 54 (SD 14) (n=29 studies).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;*IY 14: Did you calculate this by hand, or is there any easy way from RevMan etc? Pooled SDs?*&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TJL: Calculated by hand. It represents a mean of means.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Long term studies, Page 7: TJL:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(I think that this is the most important part of the text, namely the pooled estimate was -5.79 mL per year (95% CI -11.87 to 0.29) - the detail of what happens in each trial is probably less important than the pooled estimate, even though there are some important details to consider for interpretation purposes. One way of reporting data could be like this (see Notes section for detail on estimates I have added): FEV1 - rate of decline: -5.79 mL per year (95% CI -11.87 to 0.29; 5 studies, 2245 participants) - With this outcome you would need to mention Pauwels 1999 as it was so large and it contained data that could not be extracted as parametric data. QoL: change in SGRQ from baseline: -1.26 units (95% CI -1.87 to -0.64; four studies, 2393 participants). Mean exacerbation rates: -0.28 exacerbations/pt/yr (95% CI -0.4 to -0.16; four studies, 2403 participants)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;*IY 15: Thanks. Would prefer to keep in the detail of the large studies, as well as describe the pooled results as you have suggested.*&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Other meta-analysis, Page 7: TJL: (This is probably best placed in discussion (i.e. what other studies have found)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;*IY 16: These included original data not included elsewhere (e.g. Derenne, subgroups of Kerstjens and Renkema) so I have included it in the original data section rather than the Discussion.*&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Figure, Page 8:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;*IY 17: How do you copy this Figure so that it comes out so clearly? Do you use Edit/ Copy to Clipboard?*&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TJL: CTRL+ALT+Print Screen. CTRL+V the image as a bitmap, edit bitmap in Microsoft Paint, then import image as additional figure in Review. Easy as pie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Side effects, long term, Page 14: TJL: (Ian - I think that you can lose the narrative from above and focus on the pooled result. There is minimal heterogeneity, implying a consistent effect across the studies).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;*IY 18: Thanks, agree.*&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;*IY 19: Van Grunsven meta-analysis: I have entered their pooled FEV1 data (which were for 3 studies) in 03-34? 8 of their 183 subjects had BDP&amp;lt;800 mcg, but I have still just kept the data in the BDP&amp;gt;800 mcg subanalysis.*&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TJL: Fine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;*IY 20: Toby, you have imported many secondary affiliated references to the primary studies e.g. Calverley 2003, Burge 2000: we do not make specific reference to many of these in the text. Is that okay? (e.g. we do not cite the abstracts presented, review articles etc). How did you find all of them and their relations to the primary study? Are they linked on your Airways database?*&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TJL: It's very important to retain these as ghost references to the principal study. There are several reasons to consider. It serves to highlight thoroughness in tracking down all relevant references that you can get hold of. It shows how many re-publications studies can generate (which is fine, but people do not seem to remember how many times a study has been published). It also helps us to show our funders how difficult it is for our reviewers as the complexity of the subject area leads to data-dredging and potentially conflicting messages that can be addressed (if not resolved) in the review.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;*IY 21: There are some abstracts imported from http://www.abstracts2view.com:*&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;*e.g. Vestbo under Calverley 2003: should we include any other detail in this reference, such as which meeting it was presented at?*&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TJL: Only worthwhile if it serves as the primary reference to the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Other changes/comments by IY 17/12/2005 and Earlier questions from June 2005:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;IY 22: Number of Participants: revised figure calculated (Page 5) from Excel spreadsheet (&amp;quot;Current&amp;quot; tab, in green)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TJL: This may need revision again due to N from FCO 30002 (see review).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;IY 23: Negative/positive data entry: For most of the data, I've put a negative sign in front of positive data and vice versa, so that the direction is correct to favour treatment or control. Is this still the Cochrane convention? It seems confusing that an increase in FEV1 is read in the Analyses as a negative amount (which would confuse readers). I will need to double check that the data entry that you and I have done have the signs around the right way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TJL: Nope - better to have positive outcome on a positive scale so that it makes more clinical sense. The negative/positive convention harks back to a time when the only thing Cochrane cared for was to stop bad stuff happening to patients (rather increase lung function or quality of life).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;*IY 24: Generic inverse variance: Did we calculate SE from CI for Analysis 02-28 to 02-31 when needed? e.g for Paggiaro 1998 6MW, the 95%CI was 1.63 to 36.4 (Page 777 of the article). Would that SE be (36.4 minus 1.63)/2/1.96 = 8.87 (rather than 8.78 as entered into Analysis 02-30)? Also the calculations for some SDs in Analysis 03.34 decline in FEV1 are slightly different in the decimal places. Please check that my Excel file (attached) has the correct calculation for SE and SD from CIs.*&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TJL - Paggiaro data taken from published article and entered &amp;amp; adjusted to get the CI as close to the published one as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;*IY 25: Subtotals: (a) For those analyses that only have one study (i.e. no pooling possible e.g. 02.29), should we click Subtotals only in RevMan, to avoid pooling of one study? (b) For those analyses e.g. 02.28 where data from one study are missing but there are full data for others, can we still attempt to pool, or should we still click Subtotals only?*&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TJL: Convention is not to pool. (weak statistical test of significance when only one study involved).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;*IY 26: Missing SD: For those results that list the mean but the SD is missing, should we enter the mean only anyway, leave the SD blank and therefore it is 'not estimable'?*&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TJL: Yes - alternatively we could impute the missing SD from elsewhere to see how much of a difference the missing data could make. Would certainly agree that leaving variance-free estimates in the analysis is necessary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;*IY 27: COPD with BHR: The small amount of available data is listed in the tab Data BHR. Where should this be entered on RevMan? As subgroups under the various analyses (e.g. Comparisons 01, 02, or 03 etc) or as a separate Comparison (e.g. 05)? As it stands, all studies are described in the narrative section.*&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TJL: Worth pooling if the data are available. This probably ought to be a separate comparison.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;*IY 28: RevMan Comparison 03-34 FEV1: TJL's Burge number of subjects was 372 vs 370 but these are the total number of subjects enrolled. Have now amended the subjects to 339 vs 325 as per Table 2 of Burge (the subjects with FEV1 data available for analysis). This did not alter the effect size or CI.*&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;*IY 29: RevMan Comparison 02-32 pre BD FEV1: TJL's Bourbeau mean was 0.000 (whereas the Bourbeau Table 4 mean was -4 ml = -0.004 L); TJL's calculated SEM was 0.0459 (whereas IY's calculated SEM was 0.0464: changed in RevMan).*&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TJL: Fine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;*IY 30: RevMan Comparison 02-32 pre BD FEV1: Please provide the calculations for mean and SEM: did you calculate these from Hattotuwa's zip file that he provided?*&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TJL: Calculated from IPD - see Excel spreadsheet&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;*IY 31: Mahler 2002: RevMan Comparison 02-32 pre BD FEV1 and RevMan Comparison 02-328 post BD FEV1: I presume you obtained additional data from the authors. Please check the mean differences for predose FEV1 (Table 2): Table says 105 ml = 0.105L (whereas TJL's RevMan entry says 0.15).*&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TJL: Please see unpublished data in pdf&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also please check the number of subjects: Figure 1 of Mahler gives the number of subjects remaining at 24 months: FP n=99 and placebo n=112 (whereas TJL's RevMan entry says 168, 183 for post BD and 168, 181for pre BD).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TJL: PDF will give you the exact ITT figure&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;*IY 32: Rennard 2001: RevMan Comparison 02-32 pre BD FEV1: did you calculate the SE from the P value of &amp;lt;0.01?*&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TJL: Yes, but the pdf of unpublished data is now available (see attached).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;*IY 33: Hanania 2003: RevMan Comparison 02-32 pre BD FEV1 and RevMan Comparison 02-328 post BD FEV1: I presume you calculated these from the additional data from the authors. Please let me know how you calculated it, since Table 2 of Hanania has mean difference predose FEV1 of 112ml = 0.112L (whereas you have 0.08L in RevMan) and mean difference post dose FEV1 of 89ml = 0.089L (whereas you have 0.08L in RevMan)*&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TJL - This was estimated from graph (see excel and pdf)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;*IY 34: Mahler 2002: RevMan Comparison 02-14 no. with &amp;gt;1 exacerbation: I presume you obtained additional data from the authors, because I can't find the data in the paper. Please supply the additional data.*&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TJL: Data in pdf. Different from numbers in review.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I*Y 35: Lung Health Study 2002: RevMan Comparison 03-34 Post-bronchodilator FEV1 decline: Please give details about the SE calculation (from the P value?)*&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TJL: Below&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On another note, I agree that the mean difference is -2.8 ml/yr from Row 2 of Table 2 (Triamcinolone -44.2 vs Placebo -47.0). The number of subjects that is based on is not clear (you have entered Triamcinolone n=558 vs Placebo n=555). The Lung Health Study statisticians sent me additional data:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Change in post-bronchodilator FEV1 over time:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ICS -44.01 ml/yr (N=553, SD=76.22)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Placebo -45.91 ml/yr (N=545, SD=77.57), which is a little different to their Table 2 in the paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Which should we use?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TJL: Depends - which one is ITT? They both look pretty 'complete' to me. My own concern is that the difference between the two means reported in table and from the email you got are slightly different. Although not by much.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How can we calculate a pooled SE for mean difference from 2 different SDs?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TJL: WMD generates a mean difference and 95% CI. This can be converted to a mean and SE. Replicating the mean difference + 95% CI is actually very simple.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;*IY 36: RevMan Comparison 03-34 Post-bronchodilator FEV1 decline: graph labels changed so that the Favours Steroid is to the left: the trend is for the steroids to be better (diamonds are all to the left because of the negative difference in rate of decline with steroids).*&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TJL: Agreed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;*IY 37: RevMan Comparison 03-34 Post-bronchodilator FEV1 decline for &amp;gt;6 months treatment: we haven't entered the Calverley 2003 (TRISTAN), Calverley 2003a (budesonide/formoterol), Calverley 2003b (abstract - mometasone; SE from P value only) or Szafranski 2003 data - all because we don't have the SE's or even the mean differences.*&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Would you have additional data?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Should we enter these 1 year studies to join the 4 big three year trials in the same comparison?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TJL: This is an interesting conundrum. I would prefer to leave the different FEV1 measurements as separate outcomes for several reasons:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rate of decline is not the same as change from baseline. It is an annualised rate, which takes account of between patient deterioration, and so assumes that negative is better (deterioration less). The SD for this would reflect something different from what is being measured and reported in mean change from baseline. The intention to treat analysis may well have been needed to be more conservative than for mean change, because early withdrawals due to exacerbation lead you to a considerable amount if guesswork, and could bias findings one way or another.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;*IY 38: RevMan Comparison 03-13 Exacerbations: no. per patient per year: Calverley 2003a (BUD/FORM) has missing SDs in their paper. Do you have an additional data?*&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TJL: Indeed see AZ document attached.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;*IY 39: RevMan Comparison 03-13 Exacerbations: no. per patient per year: Calverley 2003 (TRISTAN) has missing SDs in their paper. Do you have an additional data?*&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TJL: See pdf attached&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;*IY 40: RevMan Comparison 03-13 Exacerbations: no. per patient per year: Szafranski 2003 has missing means and SDs in their paper. Do you have an additional data?*&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TJL: Indeed see AZ document attached.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;*IY 41: RevMan Comparison 03-37 Exacerbations: no. per patient per year (generic inverse variance): Calverley 2003a - Please give details about the SE calculation (the SE you calculated and entered was 0.1950).*&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TJL: SE obtained from P value.

There is a need to distinguish between significant within group improvement, and a slower rate of deterioration over the longer term.

<P>Steroid preventer medications given by inhaler ('inhaled steroids') help to reduce inflammation in the air passages of people with asthma. However, it is uncertain whether these medications are beneficial in people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD, i.e. chronic bronchitis or emphysema or both).</P>
<P>We undertook a systematic review of the benefits and safety of inhaled steroids for people with COPD. Our review analysed the effects on breathing capacity, death rates, frequency of flare-ups ('exacerbations'), quality of life and side effects.</P>
<P>Pooling of the data from the 55 trials with 16,154 people showed that there was no consistent long-term benefit in the rate of decline in breathing capacity. Death rates were unchanged. Inhaled steroids were beneficial in slowing down the rate of decline in quality of life and reducing the frequency of exacerbations. Inhaled steroids increased the risk of side effects including thrush (candida) infection in the mouth and hoarseness, and the rate of pneumonia.</P>
<P>In deciding whether to use this treatment, consumers and health professionals should weigh up the benefits (reduced rate of exacerbations, reduced decline in quality of life and possible reduction in the rate of decline of breathing capacity) against the side effects (mouth thrush, hoarseness and increased risk of developing pneumonia).</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>The role of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) has been the subject of much controversy. Major international guidelines recommend selective use of ICS. Recently published meta-analyses have reported conflicting findings on the effects of inhaled steroid therapy in COPD. </P>

<P>A pre-defined search strategy was used to search the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register for relevant literature. Searches are current as of July 2011.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2012-05-30 15:52:48 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included randomised trials comparing any dose of any type of inhaled steroid with a placebo control in patients with COPD. Acute bronchodilator reversibility to short-term beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists and bronchial hyper-responsiveness were not exclusion criteria. The a priori primary outcome was change in lung function. We also analysed data on mortality, exacerbations, quality of life and symptoms, rescue bronchodilator use, exercise capacity, biomarkers and safety.</P>

<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2012-05-30 15:52:51 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">
<P>Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. We contacted study authors for additional information. We collected adverse effects information from the trials.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-06-01 12:06:12 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Fifty-five primary studies with 16,154 participants met the inclusion criteria. Long-term use of ICS (more than six months) did not consistently reduce the rate of decline in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV<SUB>1</SUB>) in COPD patients (generic inverse variance analysis: mean difference (MD) 5.80 mL/year with ICS over placebo, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.28 to 11.88, 2333 participants; pooled means analysis: 6.88 mL/year, 95% CI 1.80 to 11.96, 4823 participants), although one major trial demonstrated a statistically significant difference. There was no statistically significant effect on mortality in COPD patients (odds ratio (OR) 0.98, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.16, 8390 participants). Long-term use of ICS reduced the mean rate of exacerbations in those studies where pooling of data was possible (generic inverse variance analysis: MD -0.26 exacerbations per patient per year, 95% CI -0.37 to -0.14, 2586 participants; pooled means analysis: MD -0.19 exacerbations per patient per year, 95% CI -0.30 to -0.08, 2253 participants). ICS slowed the rate of decline in quality of life, as measured by the St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (MD -1.22 units/year, 95% CI -1.83 to -0.60, 2507 participants). Response to ICS was not predicted by oral steroid response, bronchodilator reversibility or bronchial hyper-responsiveness in COPD patients. There was an increased risk of oropharyngeal candidiasis (OR 2.65, 95% CI 2.03 to 3.46, 5586 participants) and hoarseness. In the long-term studies, the rate of pneumonia was increased in the ICS group compared to placebo, in studies that reported pneumonia as an adverse event (OR 1.56, 95% CI 1.30 to 1.86, 6235 participants). The long-term studies that measured bone effects generally showed no major effect on fractures and bone mineral density over three years.</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2012-05-30 15:53:14 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Patients and clinicians should balance the potential benefits of inhaled steroids in COPD (reduced rate of exacerbations, reduced rate of decline in quality of life and possibly reduced rate of decline in FEV<SUB>1</SUB>) against the potential side effects (oropharyngeal candidiasis and hoarseness, and risk of pneumonia).</P>

<P>Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) have proven benefit in the treatment of airway inflammation in asthma, but there are still questions about their use in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The Global Initiative for Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) guidelines for COPD recommend adding ICS to long-acting beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists for symptomatic COPD patients with forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV<SUB>1</SUB>) less than 50% predicted and repeated exacerbations (GOLD COPD guidelines, <A HREF="http://www.goldcopd.org">www.goldcopd.org</A>).

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Study design</HEADING>
<P>All studies were randomised, placebo-controlled trials. All studies were described as either double-blind or double-dummy. Thirteen studies were of a cross-over design (<LINK REF="STD-Robertson-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Robertson 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Weir-1990a" TYPE="STUDY">Weir 1990a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wempe-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Wempe 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Weiner-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Weiner 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Boothman_x002d_Burrell-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Boothman-Burrell 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Culpitt-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Culpitt 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nishimura-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Nishimura 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Weiner-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Weiner 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ferreira-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Ferreira 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Loppow-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Loppow 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Thompson-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Thompson 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Brightling-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Brightling 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Guenette-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Guenette 2011</LINK>).

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Participants</HEADING>
<P>A total of 16,154 participants (13,139 in the original review) with COPD were recruited in the studies. More recent trials tended to use international criteria for the definition of COPD, and the remaining studies based their definition of COPD on lung function and smoking history (see table: '<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>'). The entry criteria differed between the studies in terms of permissible bronchial hyper-responsiveness (BHR) or bronchodilator reversibility; hence we stratified studies by whether COPD patients with these features were included. The majority of studies excluded participants who had an exacerbation within six to eight weeks prior to recruitment.</P>

<P>Various outcomes were measured in the studies (see tables '<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>'). The long-term studies (more than six months) reported FEV<SUB>1</SUB> in terms of rate of decline, and short to medium-term studies tended to report change in FEV<SUB>1</SUB> from baseline. Exacerbations were variously reported as dichotomous data (e.g. patients with one or more exacerbations), exacerbation episodes per treatment arm, or mean rate per patient per year. Some studies measured quality of life, symptoms and rescue bronchodilator usage. A group of studies specifically focused on changes in biomarkers (for example, sputum analysis). Long-term studies also analysed adverse effects.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Three-year studies</HEADING>
<P>Six large, long-term trials of ICS versus placebo were reported in COPD participants without bronchial hyper-responsiveness or bronchodilator reversibility. All were parallel studies. In the European Respiratory Society Study on COPD (EUROSCOP) study, Pauwels et al studied 1277 participants with BUD 800 g/day versus placebo for three years (<LINK REF="STD-Pauwels-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Pauwels 1999</LINK>). The participants were current smokers with mild COPD, with mean FEV<SUB>1</SUB> 77% predicted. In the initial six months of the study, BUD resulted in an increase in FEV<SUB>1</SUB> of 17 mL/year compared to a decline of 81 mL/year in the placebo group. After the initial six months, the rates of decline in FEV<SUB>1</SUB> were similar.</P>
<P>The study from Copenhagen reported by Vestbo et al used BUD 1200 g/day for six months then 800 g/day for 30 months (total three years) versus placebo in 290 participants (<LINK REF="STD-Vestbo-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Vestbo 1999</LINK>). The sample was population-based and participants were recruited if they had a FEV<SUB>1</SUB>/VC ratio of 0.7 or less without bronchodilator reversibility or oral steroid response. Forty per cent of participants stated that they had no breathing problems and 4% were never smokers. Mean post-bronchodilator FEV<SUB>1</SUB> was 86% to 87% predicted. There was no statistically significant effect of BUD on rate of decline in FEV<SUB>1</SUB>, rate of exacerbations or symptoms.</P>
<P>In the ICS in Obstructive Lung Disease in Europe (ISOLDE) study, Burge et al randomised 751 participants to FP 1000 g/day versus placebo for three years (<LINK REF="STD-Burge-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Burge 2000</LINK>). This was a moderate to severe group of participants, with mean FEV<SUB>1</SUB> 50% of predicted. All were current or ex-smokers. The majority of participants received a two-week oral prednisolone course during the run-in. FP did not alter the rate of overall rate of decline of FEV<SUB>1</SUB>, although the mean FEV<SUB>1</SUB> of the FP group remained about 70 mL higher than the placebo group throughout the study. FP reduced the median exacerbation rate (<LINK REF="STD-Burge-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Burge 2000</LINK>), particularly in the moderate-severe group of participants (<LINK REF="REF-Jones-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jones 2003</LINK>). FP also slowed the decline in health status as determined by the St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) (<LINK REF="REF-Spencer-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spencer 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>The Lung Health Study II enrolled 1116 participants and randomised them to inhaled triamcinolone (TAA) 1200 g/day versus placebo for a mean duration of follow-up of 40 months (Lung Health Study Research Group 2000). Mean FEV<SUB>1</SUB> was 64% predicted and all were current smokers or ex-smokers. The rate of decline in FEV<SUB>1</SUB> was similar in the TAA and placebo groups. TAA reduced respiratory symptoms and visits to doctors for respiratory illnesses. TAA also lowered the airway reactivity to methacholine over the course of treatment.</P>
<P>The large TOwards a Revolution in COPD Health (TORCH) study recruited 6115 participants and randomised them to salmeterol/fluticasone, salmeterol, FP 1000 g/day (1534 participants) and placebo (1524 participants). In the FP versus placebo comparison, there was a reduction in COPD exacerbation rate, with odds ratio (OR) 0.823 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.758 to 0.894) (<LINK REF="STD-Calverley-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Calverley 2007</LINK>). No mortality benefit was observed with FP alone compared to placebo, with hazard ratio 1.060 (95% CI 0.886 to 1.268) (<LINK REF="REF-Ferguson-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ferguson 2006</LINK>). There was a benefit in quality of life measured by the SGRQ, with a difference of -2.0 units (95% CI -2.9 to -1.0) with FP, compared to placebo. The rate of FEV<SUB>1</SUB> decline was slower in the FP group compared to placebo (difference 13 mL/year, 95% CI 5 to 22) (<LINK REF="REF-Celli-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Celli 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>The COOPT trial recruited 286 participants (78% COPD, 22% chronic bronchitis) from 44 general practices and randomised them to FP 500 g twice daily or placebo for three years (N-acetylcysteine was used in a separate arm) (<LINK REF="STD-Schermer-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Schermer 2009</LINK>). Exacerbation rate was 1.3 times higher for the FP group compared with the placebo group, although this did not reach statistical significance. Annual decline in post-bronchodilator FEV<SUB>1</SUB> was similar between groups.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Two-year studies</HEADING>
<P>Four parallel studies of two years duration have been performed in COPD participants without bronchial hyper-responsiveness or bronchodilator reversibility (<LINK REF="STD-Derenne-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Derenne 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Renkema-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Renkema 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Weir-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Weir 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lapperre-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Lapperre 2009</LINK>). The study by Derenne was reported in abstract form (<LINK REF="STD-Derenne-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Derenne 1995</LINK>) and summarised in the meta-analysis by van Grunsven et al (<LINK REF="STD-van-Grunsven-1999" TYPE="STUDY">van Grunsven 1999</LINK>). Renkema et al studied 39 participants with BUD 1500 g/day versus placebo for two years (<LINK REF="STD-Renkema-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Renkema 1996</LINK>). They observed a reduced rate of decline in FEV<SUB>1</SUB> (although this was not statistically significant) and reduced symptoms with BUD alone versus placebo. There was no change in rate of exacerbations (<LINK REF="STD-Renkema-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Renkema 1996</LINK>). Weir et al studied 98 participants using BDP 1500 g/day versus placebo for two years (<LINK REF="STD-Weir-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Weir 1999</LINK>). There were trends to benefits with BDP in terms of decline in FEV<SUB>1</SUB> and exacerbation rates but these did not reach statistical significance. There was no change in BHR to histamine or dyspnoea as measured by the Mahler dyspnoea index. The data from COPD subgroups of the study by Kerstjens et al, which included COPD participants with BHR (<LINK REF="STD-Kerstjens-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Kerstjens 1992</LINK>), and Derenne (<LINK REF="STD-Derenne-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Derenne 1995</LINK>) were combined with the data from Renkema (<LINK REF="STD-Renkema-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Renkema 1996</LINK>) in the meta-analysis by van Grunsven et al (<LINK REF="STD-van-Grunsven-1999" TYPE="STUDY">van Grunsven 1999</LINK>) (see '<LINK TAG="DISCUSSION" TYPE="SECTION">Discussion</LINK>' for details). Lapperre et al randomised 114 participants with moderate to severe COPD to FP 500 g twice daily for six months or 30 months, or placebo twice daily (salmeterol/fluticasone was used in a separate arm) (<LINK REF="STD-Lapperre-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Lapperre 2009</LINK>). FP for 30 months was found to slow the rate of FEV<SUB>1</SUB> decline, and improve dyspnoea and quality of life. A small four-year trial studied the effect of inhaled corticosteroids on lung density in COPD (<LINK REF="STD-Shaker-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Shaker 2009</LINK>). Shaker et al demonstrated that inhaled BUD 800 g daily over two to four years showed a non-significant trend towards reducing the progression of emphysema as determined by the CT-derived 15th percentile lung density, without any statistically significant effect on decline in lung function (<LINK REF="STD-Shaker-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Shaker 2009</LINK>).</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">One-year studies</HEADING>
<P>Four parallel studies of combined ICS/long-acting beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonist (LABA) in COPD included ICS versus placebo arms. In the one-year TRISTAN study of salmeterol/FP, salmeterol, FP or placebo by Calverley et al in 1465 participants, data were available for FP 1000 g/day versus placebo in one of the comparisons (<LINK REF="STD-Calverley-2003a" TYPE="STUDY">Calverley 2003a</LINK>). FP increased pre-bronchodilator FEV<SUB>1</SUB> by 2%, compared to a fall of 3% with placebo at one year, and reduced the mean exacerbation rate of 1.3 in the placebo group to 1.05 in the FP group. There was no significant change in SGRQ total score or symptom scores with FP compared to placebo, although FP reduced the use of relief medications and awakenings per week (<LINK REF="STD-Calverley-2003a" TYPE="STUDY">Calverley 2003a</LINK>). Szafranski et al studied BUD/formoterol, BUD, formoterol or placebo in 812 COPD participants for one year (<LINK REF="STD-Szafranski-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Szafranski 2003</LINK>). Small but statistically significant benefits were observed with BUD 800 g/day compared to placebo for lung function changes and exacerbation rates. Calverley et al similarly studied these medications in 1022 COPD participants for one year, and found fewer exacerbations with BUD compared to placebo, and no significant difference in FEV<SUB>1</SUB> (<LINK REF="STD-Calverley-2003b" TYPE="STUDY">Calverley 2003b</LINK>). An unpublished study of salmeterol/FP in COPD (GlaxoSmithKline trial <LINK REF="STD-SCO30002-2005" TYPE="STUDY">SCO30002 2005</LINK>) included a comparison of FP 1000 g/day versus placebo in 256 COPD participants (<LINK REF="STD-SCO30002-2005" TYPE="STUDY">SCO30002 2005</LINK>). There was no statistically significant difference in time to first moderate or severe exacerbation with FP or change in post-bronchodilator FEV<SUB>1</SUB>.</P>
<P>Two parallel studies of MF for one year duration have been reported. A study of MF 800 g/day versus placebo in 631 COPD participants was reported in abstract form (<LINK REF="STD-Calverley-2003c" TYPE="STUDY">Calverley 2003c</LINK>). MF was associated with a benefit in post-bronchodilator FEV<SUB>1</SUB> of 40 mL, compared to placebo, reduced COPD symptoms and increased time to first exacerbation. Calverley et al randomised 911 participants with moderate to severe COPD to MF-DPI 800 g once daily, MF-DPI 400 g twice daily or placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Calverley-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Calverley 2008</LINK>). MF-DPI significantly increased post-bronchodilator FEV<SUB>1</SUB> from baseline and reduced exacerbations. The twice daily MF-DPI group reported a statistically significant reduction (19%) in COPD symptoms scores compared with placebo. SGRQ improved significantly in all domains in the pooled MF-DPI groups versus placebo.</P>

<P>In the studies of two years or longer, we analysed the main treatment effect of change in rate of FEV<SUB>1</SUB> decline. Two approaches to analysing rate of decline of post-bronchodilator FEV<SUB>1</SUB> were used, due to the various ways the data were presented in the studies.</P>
<P>When analysing data using the generic inverse variance function of RevMan 5 (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2011</LINK>), the pooled difference in rate of decline in post-bronchodilator FEV<SUB>1</SUB> in four studies (<LINK REF="STD-Vestbo-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Vestbo 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Weir-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Weir 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Burge-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Burge 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-LHS-2000" TYPE="STUDY">LHS 2000</LINK>) and one combined result (<LINK REF="STD-van-Grunsven-1999" TYPE="STUDY">van Grunsven 1999</LINK>) was 5.80 mL/year with ICS (95% CI -0.28 to 11.88; 2333 participants) (<LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>). In the study by Pauwels et al (1277 participants), there was no significant difference between the median decline of FEV<SUB>1</SUB> of -57 mL/year in the budesonide group, compared to the -69 mL/year in the placebo group (<LINK REF="STD-Pauwels-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Pauwels 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>When analysing means for the ICS versus placebo groups, the pooled difference in rate of decline in post-bronchodilator FEV<SUB>1</SUB> in five studies (<LINK REF="STD-Burge-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Burge 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-LHS-2000" TYPE="STUDY">LHS 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Celli-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Celli 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schermer-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Schermer 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shaker-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Shaker 2009</LINK>) was 6.88 mL/year (95% CI 1.80 to 11.96, 4823 participants) (<LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK>). The main contributor to this statistically significant difference was the TORCH study, which showed a difference for the ICS alone (fluticasone 1000 g/day, 42 mL/year decline) versus placebo (55 mL/year decline) (<LINK REF="REF-Celli-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Celli 2008</LINK>). In the TORCH trial, salmeterol (42 mL/year decline) and salmeterol/fluticasone (39 mL/year decline) also had similar benefits in rate of decline in FEV<SUB>1</SUB> (<LINK REF="REF-Celli-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Celli 2008</LINK>). The study of <LINK REF="STD-Lapperre-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Lapperre 2009</LINK> demonstrated a statistically significant difference in rate of decline of FEV<SUB>1</SUB> (mean difference 86.30 mL/year, 95% CI 43.02 to 129.58); however, this result was not pooled because the rate of decline measured was from six months to 30 months of treatment, instead of from 0 months.</P>
<P>In the studies of one year duration, improvements with ICS were reported for pre-bronchodilator FEV<SUB>1</SUB> (<LINK REF="STD-Szafranski-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Szafranski 2003</LINK>) and post-bronchodilator FEV<SUB>1</SUB> (<LINK REF="STD-Calverley-2003b" TYPE="STUDY">Calverley 2003b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Calverley-2003c" TYPE="STUDY">Calverley 2003c</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Calverley-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Calverley 2008</LINK>). In one study, there was no significant difference (<LINK REF="STD-SCO30002-2005" TYPE="STUDY">SCO30002 2005</LINK>) and one study did not report the spirometry results specifically for the inhaled steroid versus placebo comparison (<LINK REF="STD-Calverley-2003a" TYPE="STUDY">Calverley 2003a</LINK>).</P>

The mean difference (MD) for this analysis was -0.26 exacerbations per patient per year with ICS (95% CI -0.37 to -0.14; 2586 participants) (Comparison 1.5) (<LINK REF="FIG-05" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 5</LINK>). We also pooled mean rate of exacerbation per patient per year using data from treatment and control groups from four long-term studies (<LINK REF="STD-Burge-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Burge 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Calverley-2003a" TYPE="STUDY">Calverley 2003a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Szafranski-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Szafranski 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schermer-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Schermer 2009</LINK>) and a combined rate from the van Grunsven et al meta-analysis of three long-term studies (<LINK REF="STD-van-Grunsven-1999" TYPE="STUDY">van Grunsven 1999</LINK>).

<P>In other long-term studies, exacerbation events were not reported in sufficient detail to pool as mean rate of exacerbation per patient per year. The results of these studies were: no significant difference in mean exacerbation rates per year between BDP (0.36/year) and placebo (0.57/year) (<LINK REF="STD-Weir-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Weir 1999</LINK>), no significant difference in total number of exacerbations between BUD (155 exacerbations) and placebo (161 exacerbations) (<LINK REF="STD-Vestbo-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Vestbo 1999</LINK>), and reduced number of unscheduled physician visits and hospitalisation for respiratory conditions (data not stated) (<LINK REF="STD-LHS-2000" TYPE="STUDY">LHS 2000</LINK>). In one unpublished study, the total number of exacerbations was reported without analysis being performed, with 123 exacerbations in the FP group and 127 exacerbations in the placebo group (<LINK REF="STD-SCO30002-2005" TYPE="STUDY">SCO30002 2005</LINK>). In the TORCH study, the mean number of exacerbations per year was 0.93 in the FP group, compared to 1.13 in the placebo group, giving a statistically significant rate ratio of 0.82 (95% CI 0.76 to 0.89) (<LINK REF="STD-Calverley-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Calverley 2007</LINK>).

Weir et al similarly showed that there were some responders to either BDP or prednisolone, with some full or partial responders to each (<LINK REF="STD-Weir-1990a" TYPE="STUDY">Weir 1990a</LINK>). The presence of bronchodilator reversibility did not predict the presence of response to BDP or prednisolone (<LINK REF="STD-Weir-1990a" TYPE="STUDY">Weir 1990a</LINK>). Smoking history and the presence of emphysema had no influence on being a responder (<LINK REF="REF-Weir-1990b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weir 1990b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Weir-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weir 1991</LINK>). There was a weak correlation (r = 0.38) between peripheral eosinophilia and response to high dose BDP in the study by Nishimura et al, whereas there was no correlation with other factors such as bronchodilator reversibility, total serum IgE or smoking history (<LINK REF="STD-Nishimura-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Nishimura 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>Bronchodilator reversibility was found to be a predictive factor for response to ICS in the study by Weiner et al (<LINK REF="STD-Weiner-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Weiner 1995</LINK>). They found that 25% of non-reversible COPD participants increased their FEV<SUB>1</SUB> significantly with BUD, and this response rate increased to 75% if bronchodilator reversibility was present. These results were replicated in a later study by the same group (<LINK REF="STD-Weiner-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Weiner 1999</LINK>).

At three months, FP reduced mast cell numbers in the subepithelium and reduced the CD8:CD4 ratio in the epithelium. There was some improvement in symptoms but lung function was unchanged. Reduction in mucosal mast cell numbers was also shown by transmission electron microscopy in biopsies from the same study (<LINK REF="REF-Gizycki-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gizycki 2002</LINK>). There was no change in eosinophil numbers in the biopsies (<LINK REF="REF-Gizycki-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gizycki 2002</LINK>). It is unclear how the reduction in mast cell numbers relates to changes in symptoms, although it has been postulated that mast cells may be involved in mucus hypersecretion, and that reduction of mast cell numbers could contribute to the short-term improvements that are seen initially with ICS (<LINK REF="REF-Gizycki-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gizycki 2002</LINK>). FP also apparently increased the number of neutrophils in the biopsies (<LINK REF="REF-Gizycki-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gizycki 2002</LINK>). In a study of FP 1000 g/day versus placebo over six months in 23 COPD participants with BHR, Verhoeven et al found no effect on inflammatory cell indices on bronchial biopsy (<LINK REF="STD-Verhoeven-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Verhoeven 2002</LINK>).

However, a biopsy study at 30 months of FP 1000 g/day showed reductions in CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocytes, reduction in mast cells, increase in eosinophils and increase in intact bronchial epithelium, as well as reduced sputum neutrophils, macrophages and lymphocytes (<LINK REF="STD-Lapperre-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Lapperre 2009</LINK>).</P>

<P>This systematic review of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) has analysed the following outcomes:</P>
<OL>
<LI>
<B>Lung function</B>: Long-term use of ICS (more than six months) did not consistently reduce the rate of decline in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV<SUB>1</SUB>) in COPD patients (generic inverse variance analysis: mean difference (MD) 5.80 mL/year with ICS, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.28 to 11.88, 2333 participants; pooled means analysis: 6.88 mL/year, 95% CI 1.80 to 11.96, 4823 participants).</LI>
<LI>
<B>Mortality</B>: Long-term use of ICS had no statistically significant effect on mortality in COPD patients (odds ratio (OR) 0.98, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.16, 8390 participants).</LI>
<LI>
<B>Exacerbations</B>: Long-term use of ICS reduced the mean rate of exacerbations in those studies where pooling of data was possible (generic inverse variance analysis: MD -0.26 exacerbations per patient per year, 95% CI -0.37 to -0.14, 2586 participants; pooled means analysis: MD -0.19 exacerbations per patient per year, 95% CI -0.30 to -0.08, 2253 participants).</LI>
<LI>
<B>Quality of life and symptoms</B>: ICS slowed the rate of decline in quality of life, as measured by the St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) (MD -1.22 units/year, 95% CI -1.83 to -0.60, 2507 participants).</LI>
<LI>
<B>Rescue bronchodilator use</B>: There was a reduction in rescue bronchodilator use in some medium-term studies.</LI>
<LI>
<B>Exercise capacity</B>: This outcome was generally not measured.</LI>
<LI>
<B>Biomarkers</B>: The relatively few studies that measured airway biomarkers showed a mixed response to ICS, with only some studies demonstrating an anti-inflammatory effect of ICS.</LI>
<LI>
<B>Predictors of response</B>: Response to ICS was not predicted by oral steroid response, bronchodilator reversibility or bronchial hyper-responsiveness in COPD patients.</LI>
<LI>
<B>Side effects</B>: ICS increased the risk of oropharyngeal candidiasis (OR 2.65, 95% CI 2.03 to 3.46, 5656 participants) and hoarseness. The few long-term studies that measured bone effects showed generally showed no major effect on fractures and bone mineral density over three years. In long-term studies that reported pneumonia as an adverse event, the rate of pneumonia was increased in the ICS group (OR 1.56, 95% CI 1.30 to 1.86, 6235 participants).</LI>

<HEADING LEVEL="2">Lung function</HEADING>
<P>Change in lung function was the primary outcome of the majority of long-term studies; hence, this was the a priori primary outcome of this systematic review. The question of effect of ICS on progression of airflow limitation has been addressed in a number of systematic reviews. The first systematic review was performed by van Grunsven et al (<LINK REF="STD-van-Grunsven-1999" TYPE="STUDY">van Grunsven 1999</LINK>). This meta-analysis combined data from two-year studies by Renkema et al (<LINK REF="STD-Renkema-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Renkema 1996</LINK>) and Derenne (<LINK REF="STD-Derenne-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Derenne 1995</LINK>), and a subgroup of the study by Kerstjens et al (<LINK REF="STD-Kerstjens-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Kerstjens 1992</LINK>). They included individual patient data from these studies, and applied stricter criteria for COPD, consisting of pulmonary symptoms compatible with COPD, age 40 and over, persisting airflow obstruction post-bronchodilator, lack of reversibility to bronchodilator, and presence of smoking history. From the two-year Renkema et al study of 39 patients having budesonide (BUD) 1600 g/day versus placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Renkema-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Renkema 1996</LINK>), 30 were eligible for the meta-analysis. From the 30-month Kerstjens et al study of 51 COPD patients with bronchial hyper-responsiveness (BHR) having 800 g/day versus placebo (or ipratropium, which was counted as "placebo") (<LINK REF="STD-Kerstjens-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Kerstjens 1992</LINK>), 15 were eligible. The previously unpublished details of the study by <LINK REF="STD-Derenne-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Derenne 1995</LINK> were reported in the meta-analysis. Beclomethasone dipropionate (BDP) 1500 g/day versus placebo was assessed over two years in 194 patients with moderate to severe COPD. Of these patients, 152 were eligible. Overall, the meta-analysis of these three studies found no benefit for change in post-bronchodilator FEV<SUB>1</SUB> with ICS, although there was a small benefit for change in pre-bronchodilator FEV<SUB>1</SUB> (<LINK REF="STD-van-Grunsven-1999" TYPE="STUDY">van Grunsven 1999</LINK>). The benefit was significant for higher doses of ICS; however, there were few patients receiving the lower dose. A review by <LINK REF="REF-Riancho-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Riancho 2002</LINK>, published in the Spanish language, pooled short-term studies and found a small increase of 96 mL FEV<SUB>1</SUB> over one to six months. They observed that there was a small difference in FEV<SUB>1</SUB> of 51 mL in favour of ICS after one to three years of continued treatment. They concluded that ICS were probably not of benefit in patients with non-asthmatic COPD. In a systematic review of studies published up to 2001, Alsaeedi et al (<LINK REF="REF-Alsaeedi-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alsaeedi 2002</LINK>) were unable to pool data for decline in FEV<SUB>1</SUB> due to lack of standard deviations for some of the studies.</P>
<P>Highland et al (<LINK REF="REF-Highland-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Highland 2003</LINK>) reviewed the long-term effects on FEV<SUB>1</SUB> in studies published up to 2002. These reviewers pooled data for rate of decline in FEV<SUB>1</SUB> for six long-term studies, and found a non-statistically significant difference of 5.0 mL/year with ICS (P = 0.11; 3571 participants). They concluded that there was no effect of ICS on long-term decline in FEV<SUB>1</SUB>. The Highland et al meta-analysis was subsequently corrected by the authors, giving a MD of 5.31 mL/year (95% CI -0.64 to 11.2) (P = 0.08) (erratum in Ann Intern Med 2003;139(10):873). The accompanying editorial suggested that heterogeneity in inflammatory responses may explain some of the discordance between short-term clinical and long-term FEV<SUB>1</SUB> responses (<LINK REF="REF-Epstein-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Epstein 2003</LINK>). In a similar analysis, Sutherland et al (<LINK REF="REF-Sutherland-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sutherland 2003</LINK>) pooled data for rate of decline in FEV<SUB>1</SUB> for long-term studies published up to early 2003. In contrast to the Highland et al meta-analysis, the Sutherland et al meta-analysis showed that ICS reduced the rate of FEV<SUB>1</SUB> decline by 7.7 mL/year (P = 0.02; 3715 participants), and the effect was greater for higher doses of ICS. They concluded that ICS may potentially have important long-term effects in COPD. The accompanying editorial (<LINK REF="REF-Burge-2003b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burge 2003b</LINK>) elucidated the possible differences between the meta-analyses of Highland et al and Sutherland et al. With hypothetical adjustments to achieve more concordance in the data, the editorial by Burge and Lewis (<LINK REF="REF-Burge-2003b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burge 2003b</LINK>) showed that the Highland et al effect size would have been 5.5 mL/year (P = 0.07), compared to the Sutherland et al effect size of 7.7 mL/ year (P = 0.02). They pointed out that these mean effect sizes and P values were not too dissimilar. In our meta-analysis, the effect size of 5.8 mL/year using the generic inverse variance analysis was between the two effect sizes found by Highland et al and Sutherland et al, as was our P value of 0.06 for this analysis. The main factors that explain the small differences between these effect sizes include (I) interpretation of numerical data, i.e. whether the direction of improvement in the Vestbo et al study (<LINK REF="STD-Vestbo-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Vestbo 1999</LINK>) was positive or negative (<LINK REF="REF-Burge-2003b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burge 2003b</LINK>), (ii) inclusion/exclusion of the EUROSCOP study which presented median values (<LINK REF="STD-Pauwels-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Pauwels 1999</LINK>), (iii) inclusion/exclusion of the van Grunsven et al meta-analysis, and (iv) calculation of missing standard deviations.</P>
<P>In the Inhaled Steroids Effect Evaluation in COPD (ISEEC) study, Soriano et al (<LINK REF="REF-Soriano-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Soriano 2007</LINK>) pooled data from seven randomised controlled trials of ICS (3911 participants) versus placebo lasting &#8805; 12 months in patients with moderate to severe COPD. Studies included were LHS-2, CCLS (<LINK REF="STD-Vestbo-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Vestbo 1999</LINK>), ISOLDE (<LINK REF="STD-Burge-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Burge 2000</LINK>), EUROSCOP (<LINK REF="STD-Pauwels-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Pauwels 1999</LINK>), TRISTAN (<LINK REF="STD-Calverley-2003a" TYPE="STUDY">Calverley 2003a</LINK>), <LINK REF="STD-Szafranski-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Szafranski 2003</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Calverley-2003b" TYPE="STUDY">Calverley 2003b</LINK>. These authors found that in the first six months, ICS was associated with a significant mean increase in FEV<SUB>1</SUB> (mean change in FEV<SUB>1</SUB> 2.42%, SE 0.19%, P &lt; 0.01), and was more effective in ex-smokers (compared to current smokers) and women. However, for use of ICS in studies longer than six months, their systematic review found that ICS did not significantly improve FEV<SUB>1</SUB> decline (mean change in FEV<SUB>1</SUB> -0.01%, standard error (SE) 0.09%, P = 0.86).</P>
<P>In our updated systematic review, we pooled data for rate of FEV<SUB>1</SUB> decline in the long-term studies (&gt; six months duration) using two statistical approaches, depending on reporting of data in the studies. The generic inverse variance analysis did not show a statistically significant difference in rate of FEV<SUB>1</SUB> decline calculated from baseline to study completion; however, the pooled means analysis of 4781 participants, which included the large TORCH study (<LINK REF="STD-Calverley-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Calverley 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Celli-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Celli 2008</LINK>), found a relatively small but statistically significant difference of 6.88 mL/year benefit, albeit with a wide confidence interval. In some of the medium-term studies (greater than two months and up to six months), there were small improvements in pre- and post-bronchodilator FEV<SUB>1</SUB> in favour of ICS.</P>
<P>Whether objective physiological measures are the best outcomes in COPD studies is still contentious. Furthermore, even if physiology is the optimal outcome, other measures such as inspiratory capacity may correlate better with subjective outcomes, compared to FEV<SUB>1</SUB>. However, FEV<SUB>1</SUB> has been shown to be a prognostic factor in COPD, and remains the defining criterion for the diagnosis and severity of COPD. Hence lung function was the primary outcome of interest in the majority of the long-term trials. The clinically important difference in change in rates of FEV<SUB>1</SUB> decline is not yet clearly known. As discussed by others, a difference in rate of decline in FEV<SUB>1</SUB> of magnitude ~6 mL/year could be considered clinically unimportant when compared to a current smoker rate of 60 mL/year, and clinically important when compared to a non-smoker rate of 30 mL/year (<LINK REF="REF-Burge-2003b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burge 2003b</LINK>). Another issue is that excessive dropouts from the placebo group who have rapid decline may mean that the effect size of active treatment is underestimated, because the remaining participants in the placebo group have less rapid decline (<LINK REF="REF-Calverley-2003d" TYPE="REFERENCE">Calverley 2003d</LINK>), although attrition bias could affect decline in the opposite direction (<LINK REF="REF-Suissa-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Suissa 2008</LINK>). It has also been debated as to whether the small improvement on FEV<SUB>1</SUB> observed in some short and medium-term studies is of clinical importance (<LINK REF="REF-Burge-2003b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burge 2003b</LINK>).</P>
<P>Taking these considerations into account, our systematic review has found that use of ICS alone in COPD patients results in a small, initial improvement in FEV<SUB>1</SUB>, and then no consistent improvement in the long-term rate of decline in FEV<SUB>1</SUB>, although long-term use of ICS &gt; 1000 g BDP daily equivalent may be associated with a small improvement in the rate of decline in post-bronchodilator FEV<SUB>1</SUB>.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="2">Mortality</HEADING>
<P>Mortality is a major health outcome in COPD. Of the long-term studies, only <LINK REF="STD-Calverley-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Calverley 2007</LINK> was designed to study the effect of ICS on mortality as a primary outcome; hence, we analysed mortality as a secondary outcome. In this current review, the available mortality data from nine long-term studies involving long-term use of ICS had no statistically significant effect on mortality (OR 0.98 for mortality, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.16, P = 0.84, 8390 participants). The data from five medium-term studies also showed no statistically significant effect on mortality.</P>
<P>Observational studies have found reduced mortality with the use of ICS in COPD patients (<LINK REF="REF-Sin-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sin 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sin-2003a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sin 2003a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Soriano-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Soriano 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mapel-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mapel 2006</LINK>), including reduction in cardiovascular deaths (<LINK REF="REF-Macie-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Macie 2006</LINK>). Various epidemiological issues arising from these observational studies have been discussed, including immortal time bias, which is the issue of unaccounted-for survival time in the 'treatment' group before they actually received treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Suissa-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Suissa 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Suissa-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Suissa 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>The effect of ICS on mortality in COPD patients has been addressed by recent meta-analyses. Alsaeedi et al (<LINK REF="REF-Alsaeedi-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alsaeedi 2002</LINK>) found a non-significant relative risk of 0.84 (95% CI 0.60 to 1.18, 3473 participants) in five long-term studies published up to 2001. The systematic review by Gartlehner et al of 12 studies published up to early 2005 observed a non-significant relative risk of 0.81 (95% CI 0.60 to 1.08, 4370 participants) (<LINK REF="REF-Gartlehner-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gartlehner 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>The systematic review by Sin et al<I>, </I>using individual patient data from seven studies up to 2005 involving 5085 patients (<LINK REF="REF-Sin-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sin 2005</LINK>), found a mortality benefit with ICS in COPD. The adjusted hazard ratio for all-cause mortality from their review was 0.73 (95% CI 0.57 to 0.99, P = 0.03, 5085 participants). Their review found that the mortality benefit with ICS was stronger in specific subgroups: females, former smokers and patients with baseline post-bronchodilator FEV<SUB>1</SUB> less than 60% predicted. The systematic review of Sin et al had the methodological strength of access to individual patient data, in order to adjust for age, sex, baseline lung function, smoking status and body mass index (<LINK REF="REF-Wedzicha-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wedzicha 2005</LINK>). Hence they were able to present adjusted hazard ratios across the individual trials. As discussed in the editorial accompanying the Sin et al meta-analysis (<LINK REF="REF-Wedzicha-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wedzicha 2005</LINK>), the effect sizes of ICS in various meta-analyses appeared to be similar across several major outcomes, e.g. ~25% reduction in exacerbations, 25% improvement in rate of decline of FEV<SUB>1</SUB> (compared to the non-smoker rate) and 27% reduction in mortality from the Sin et al review.</P>
<P>Our current review has found no significant difference in mortality rate with the use of ICS as a mono-component versus placebo. This lack of effect was found both in the long-term studies published prior to the TORCH study, and in all long-term studies pooled including TORCH. The TORCH study itself, which was the largest of the long-term studies, found no mortality benefit with fluticasone propionate (FP) as a mono-component, although the combination of salmeterol/fluticasone potentially reduced mortality (<LINK REF="STD-Calverley-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Calverley 2007</LINK>). Limitations of pooling data from the long-term studies have been discussed in detail by others, including the use of intention-to-treat analysis versus completed participants in some studies, different run-in protocols and differential effect of dropouts (<LINK REF="REF-Wedzicha-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wedzicha 2005</LINK>). Even given these limitations, the pooled data indicate no statistically significant mortality benefit for ICS given as a mono-component. The meta-analysis by <LINK REF="REF-Drummond-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Drummond 2008</LINK> of 11 studies (14,426 participants), including studies of combination inhaler versus long-acting beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonist (LABA), found no difference in mortality rate at one year.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Exacerbations</HEADING>
<P>Acute exacerbations are an important cause of morbidity and mortality in COPD patients (<LINK REF="REF-Donaldson-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Donaldson 2006</LINK>). In our current review, data were available for pooling in some of the long-term and medium-term studies. Where pooling of data was possible in the long-term studies, there was a statistically significant benefit of ICS in reducing the mean rate of exacerbations (generic inverse variance analysis: MD -0.26 exacerbations per patient per year, P &lt; 0.0001, 2586 participants; pooled means analysis: MD -0.19 exacerbations per patient per year, 95% CI -0.30 to -0.08, 2253 participants).</P>
<P>In a systematic review of studies up to 2001, Alsaeedi et al pooled the total COPD exacerbation rates, by calculating the frequency of COPD exacerbations per patient-month of treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Alsaeedi-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alsaeedi 2002</LINK>). Their review found a significant benefit of ICS for reducing exacerbations (risk ratio (RR) 0.70, 95% CI 0.58 to 0.84, 2615 participants). In the systematic review of studies up to early 2005, Gartlehner et al found a reduction in the rate of COPD exacerbations with ICS (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.59 to 0.77, 4300 participants) (<LINK REF="REF-Gartlehner-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gartlehner 2006</LINK>). This effect size was based on data pooled from both medium and long-term studies. In their review, the benefit was mainly in the moderate to severe COPD subgroup. Variations in the approach to analysis are seen in the systematic reviews of Alsaeedi et al and Gartlehner et al, compared to our review. Their data were primarily analysed in terms of relative risk, rather than differences in mean rates of exacerbations. Furthermore, there were some minor differences with our review in terms of the selection of studies for inclusion and the particular exacerbation outcome extracted. The meta-analysis by <LINK REF="REF-Agarwal-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Agarwal 2010</LINK> found a small but statistically significant reduction in the risk of exacerbations (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.73 to 0.92, 8164 participants), when analysing risk of exacerbations, as opposed to exacerbations per patient per year. This was similar to our result of OR 0.83 when analysing risk of exacerbations (Comparison 1.8).</P>
<P>Methodological issues have recently been discussed in detail in relation to analysis of exacerbation rates. It has been suggested that accounting for the length of follow-up time of each participant (weighted approach) is a potentially less biased method of analysis than not accounting for this (unweighted approach) (<LINK REF="REF-Suissa-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Suissa 2006</LINK>). To explore this, we stratified the long-term studies by whether they used the weighted or unweighted approach (Comparison 1.7). In both approaches, a statistically significant reduction in exacerbations was observed. Variation in the definition of exacerbations and in study design (for example, run-in periods) may also account for differences between study outcomes in relation to exacerbation rates (<LINK REF="REF-Scott-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scott 2006</LINK>). Cohort studies have observed populations of frequent and non-frequent exacerbators (<LINK REF="REF-Vestbo-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vestbo 2011</LINK>). The presence of these distinct patient groups may lead to a bimodal, non-normal distribution of exacerbation rates, making analysis more complex (<LINK REF="REF-Scott-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scott 2006</LINK>). Therefore, it may be that ICS can reduce the number of exacerbations, particularly in frequent exacerbators (that is, frequent exacerbators have a reduction in the number of exacerbations) yet may not reduce the percentage of patients with one or more exacerbations (i.e. the frequent exacerbators do not become non-frequent exacerbators). Other methodological issues raised included the discontinuation of ICS in patients who are already taking these prior to commencement of a trial, and lack of complete follow-up of exacerbations on an intention-to-treat basis in those participants who have withdrawn from the study (<LINK REF="REF-Suissa-2008a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Suissa 2008a</LINK>), which could both overestimate the observed benefits of ICS.</P>
<P>Even taking into account these issues, and also the lack of available data to pool in some of the medium and long-term studies, our systematic review has observed a statistically significant reduction in the mean exacerbation rate per year with ICS. The magnitude of the effect is relatively small yet potentially important, given that frequent exacerbations worsen lung function decline (<LINK REF="REF-Kanner-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kanner 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Donaldson-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Donaldson 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vestbo-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vestbo 2011</LINK>) and reduce quality of life.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Quality of life and symptoms</HEADING>
<P>Improving patient-centred, subjective outcomes is an important goal in the management of COPD. This systematic review found that, in those long-term studies which measured quality of life and where data could be pooled, ICS slowed the rate of decline in quality of life, when measured with the SGRQ. The magnitude of this benefit was relatively small (MD -1.22 units/year), compared to the minimum clinically significant difference of 4 units with the SGRQ. The effect on quality of life appeared linear, based on graphical analysis of change in quality of life scores in each study (data not shown). Medium-term use of ICS tended to improve quality of life, although pooling of data was not possible. Some medium-term studies showed that an improvement in respiratory symptoms, but not all studies were able to demonstrate this. In the systematic review by Gartlehner et al, quality of life was examined qualitatively and was not pooled due to heterogeneity (<LINK REF="REF-Gartlehner-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gartlehner 2006</LINK>). Overall our review showed a small yet statistically significant benefit for quality of life using ICS. It is not clear whether this benefit is related to other benefits such as reduced frequency of exacerbations.</P>

<P>There have been relatively few randomised, controlled trials of the effects of inhaled steroid on biomarkers in COPD. Due to the heterogeneity of outcomes used, we performed a narrative review of these biomarker studies. Some studies observed reductions in airway neutrophil counts and other anti-inflammatory effects such as reduced exhaled nitric oxide. Other studies found no significant difference in inflammatory cells in the airways (as measured in biopsies, induced sputum and BAL fluid). Overall, this qualitative review showed a mixed response of airway biomarkers to ICS in COPD patients. This could partially be explained by the relative steroid resistance due to reduced histone deacetylase activity in COPD lungs (<LINK REF="REF-Barnes-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barnes 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ito-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ito 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>A systematic review was performed by Gan et al of the effects of ICS on sputum cell counts (<LINK REF="REF-Gan-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gan 2005</LINK>). Gan et al found that longer treatment duration (more than six weeks) or higher dose (&gt; 60 mg cumulative dose) resulted in greater reductions in sputum total cell count, neutrophil count and lymphocyte count, with no significant differences in macrophages or eosinophil counts (<LINK REF="REF-Gan-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gan 2005</LINK>). Due to differences in reporting study outcomes, they analysed standardised mean differences. Some of their nine included studies were double-blinded and other studies were single-blinded or open-label studies, which differs from our review in that only double-blinded studies were included in our review. Another report has suggested that ICS may have an important effect on systemic inflammation in COPD (<LINK REF="REF-Man-2005a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Man 2005a</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Predictors of response</HEADING>
<P>Predicting the response to ICS in COPD patients is a clinically useful goal, in order to individualise treatment. Clinical indicators such as oral steroid responsiveness or current smoking did not adequately predict responders to ICS. Some studies included COPD patients with bronchodilator reversibility or bronchial hyper-responsiveness, although the number of studies and their sample sizes were small. The presence of bronchodilator reversibility and bronchial hyper-responsiveness in COPD generally did not predict responsiveness to ICS. Therefore, the challenge remains to identify clinical or biological factors that predict those COPD patients who are more likely to benefit from long term ICS.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Side effects</HEADING>
<P>The safety aspects of ICS are important in the long term, especially in older COPD patients with co-morbidities. As expected, our review found an increased risk of local side effects such as oropharyngeal candidiasis. The systemic effects of prolonged use were less clear, with several studies showing no change in fracture rate or bone mineral density (<LINK REF="STD-Pauwels-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Pauwels 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Johnell-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnell 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Burge-2003a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burge 2003a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Calverley-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Calverley 2007</LINK>), whereas one study using a smaller dose of ICS showed a reduction in bone mineral density (<LINK REF="STD-LHS-2000" TYPE="STUDY">LHS 2000</LINK>). The systematic review by Alsaeedi et al noted that there was an increase in oropharyngeal candidiasis and skin bruising, and variable effects on bone mineral density (<LINK REF="REF-Alsaeedi-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alsaeedi 2002</LINK>). The systemic review by Gartlehner et al observed that there were variable results on bone mineral density and risk of fractures, including in some case-control studies (<LINK REF="REF-Gartlehner-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gartlehner 2006</LINK>). The meta-analysis by <LINK REF="REF-Loke-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Loke 2011</LINK> pooled results from randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of ICS or combination inhalers, and observational studies, and found a small but statistically significant increase in risk of fractures with ICS use in COPD. Our review found no statistically significant increase in fracture risk in studies of ICS as a mono-component versus placebo for one year or longer.</P>
<P>In the long-term studies, the rate of pneumonia as an adverse event was increased in the ICS group, in the six studies that reported this outcome (OR 1.56, 95% CI 1.30 to 1.86, 6235 participants). The TORCH study observed a reduction in rate of exacerbations, but also an increase in self reported pneumonia in the adverse events and serious adverse events (<LINK REF="STD-Calverley-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Calverley 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Crim-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Crim 2009</LINK>), although radiological or microbiological confirmation was not required. In a meta-analysis using patient-level data and adjusting for clinical confounders, Sin et al found no increased risk of pneumonia at one year of budesonide (or budesonide/formoterol) use in COPD (adjusted hazard ratio 1.05, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.37, 7042 participants) (<LINK REF="REF-Sin-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sin 2009</LINK>). In contrast, two meta-analysis found similar results to our pooled result of increased risk of pneumonia. The meta-analysis by <LINK REF="REF-Drummond-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Drummond 2008</LINK> of any ICS (including in combination inhalers) found an increase in risk of pneumonia (RR 1.34, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.75). Similarly the meta-analysis by <LINK REF="REF-Singh-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Singh 2009</LINK> found an increased risk of pneumonia with any ICS use (including in combination inhalers) for at least 24 weeks in COPD, with RR 1.60 (95% CI 1.33 to 1.92), but no increase in pneumonia-related mortality or overall mortality.</P>
<P>The mechanisms for this potential increase in pneumonia are unclear. In the two-year INSPIRE study of salmeterol/fluticasone versus tiotropium, the number of <I>de novo</I> pneumonias not preceded by symptoms of exacerbations were similar between the two treatment groups (<LINK REF="REF-Calverley-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Calverley 2011</LINK>). However, unresolved exacerbations preceding pneumonia were more common in the salmeterol/fluticasone-treated patients (32 exacerbations in 658 patients), compared to the tiotropium-treated group (seven exacerbations in 665 patients). Future studies should prospectively confirm the diagnosis of pneumonia using clinical and radiological evidence (<LINK REF="REF-Welte-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Welte 2009</LINK>). Until the risk of pneumonia is confirmed, clinicians should be vigilant to the development of pneumonia in COPD patients, particularly those with prolonged exacerbations.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Interpretation of results</HEADING>
<P>In interpreting the results of this systematic review, a number of clinical and epidemiological issues should be considered. There was wide variability in study characteristics, including dose and duration of ICS, severity of COPD, inclusion criteria (e.g. current or ex-smokers, bronchial hyper-responsiveness, bronchodilator reversibility) and outcomes studied. Furthermore, results for outcomes were sometimes either missing or could not be pooled (e.g. non-parametric data; continuous versus categorical classification of similar outcomes such as change in FEV<SUB>1</SUB>). Subgroup analysis, whilst potentially useful, was not possible due to lack of individual data. With the use of the generic inverse variance function, it was possible to pool data for some of the medium-term and long-term studies. Side effects were measured in most of the studies, although even longer studies would probably be required to determine the rates of adverse effects such as vertebral fractures and cataracts. The ICS only studies reviewed here should be interpreted in the light of the newer studies using combination inhalers of LABA/ICS, which may be more effective than ICS alone in COPD. Finally, participants who withdrew from the placebo arm of the long-term ICS studies may have been those patients who were deteriorating the most rapidly, which may underestimate the effect of active treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Calverley-2003d" TYPE="REFERENCE">Calverley 2003d</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Conclusions</HEADING>
<P>This systematic review has analysed all relevant published and unpublished RCTs of inhaled steroids used as a mono-component, in patients with stable COPD. Despite variability in study design, interventions and outcomes used, pooling of data was possible for important outcomes, particularly in the long-term studies. Inhaled steroids had a beneficial effect on frequency of COPD exacerbations and rate of decline of quality of life, whereas they did not appear to have consistent effects on lung function decline or mortality in COPD. Local side effects (oropharyngeal candidiasis and hoarseness) were increased, and the risk of pneumonia was possibly increased. Therefore clinicians and patients should balance the potential benefits of inhaled steroids in COPD (possible reduction in rate of lung function decline, reduced exacerbations, reduced rate of decline in quality of life) against the potential side effects (local oropharyngeal effects and increase in risk of pneumonia).</P>

<P>We read your review with great interest, and thank the authors for clarifying and updating the evidence for inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) in COPD patients. Our group have some concerns regarding the evaluation of the TOwards A Revolution in COPD Health (TORCH) trial, which we feel may benefit from some clarification by the authorship team. We feel the TORCH trial may have a higher risk of bias than its attributed overall 'low' rating which may impact upon the review findings considering its large size. This is due to the following observations:</P>
<OL>
<LI>The TORCH protocol indicates that an intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis was to be conducted (3), however, following randomization 72 (1.2%) participants were excluded from five independent study sites because of unblinding caused by: fraudulent data, falsified signatures, failure to follow GCP and International Conference on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceutical use for Human Use guidelines, and compromised patient safety (1). 38.3% participant withdrawal occurred prior to study completion. The TORCH authors state that &#8220;adverse events included death during the study period but may not have included deaths occurring after patients withdrew from the study&#8221; (2) which appears to contradict the protocol that indicated outcome data would be collected for the duration of the study for all enrolled and randomized participants (3). It is unclear whether mortality outcomes were collected for the duration of the study in participants who withdrew early. This analysis may not therefore constitute an ITT, and may have underestimated the incidence of mortality in all treatment arms.</LI>
<LI>The TORCH study authors did not provide clear criteria related to symptoms for the definition of an acute exacerbation which may make it difficult to conclude significant benefit of inhaled corticosteroids on moderate to severe exacerbations. Their analysis of exacerbations per patient per year may be affected by a small portion of patients who experience a large number of exacerbations per year when reported as a mean. And it is unclear whether exacerbations were recorded once participants withdrew or were excluded from the trial, contrary to their pre-specified protocol (2).</LI>
<LI>As study participants were screened for adverse effects and changes in FEV1 by physicians approximately every 12 and 24 weeks, we feel there is potential for both study participants and personnel to have become unblinded to treatments posing risks of performance and/or detection bias. The decrease in number of exacerbations in participants receiving fluticasone when compared to placebo may therefore not necessarily yield the same results once this is taken into account.</LI>
<LI>In their primary analysis of St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) data, the TORCH study authors only included data from &#8220;linguistically valid translations&#8221; (2). 36% of participants were not included as part of the author's primary analyses, with 19% initially reported as having not completed a validated questionnaire. A further 21% were censored despite having competed a linguistically valid SGRQ. The precise reasons for these observations are unclear, however the significant attrition, potentially caused by compromised randomization, may affect conclusions about the efficacy of fluticasone on patient-reported quality of life. We believe your statement that fluticasone confers a mean &#8220;benefit&#8221; of -2.0 units over 3 years when compared to placebo as derived from the TORCH trial may be better expressed in the context of the margin being below the threshold difference of four points for clinical significance, and the data are likely incomplete (4).</LI>
</OL>
<P>Our independent analysis of the risk of bias for the TORCH trial is as follows: Selection bias (low), performance bias (unclear), detection bias (unclear), attrition bias (high), reporting bias (low).</P>

<P>We greatly appreciate the interest in our review, and would like to address the helpful feedback about potential limitations of the TORCH study.</P>
<OL>
<LI>Whilst 72 of the 6184 participants were excluded due to five sites that failed audits, the Supplemental Appendix 2 indicates that &#8216;post-hoc analyses in which the 72 participants who were removed from the study were included did not materially change the outcome measures.&#8217; As these were exclusions, rather than participant withdrawals, it is appropriate that the data from these participants not be included in the mortality analysis, and that the study remains as intention to treat. For participants who were withdrawn, Appendix 2 states that &#8216;For any subject who withdrew prematurely from the study, all available data up to the time of discontinuation were included in the analyses. Mortality data continued to be collected for subjects who withdrew early, up to 3 years after the start of study treatment.&#8217; As indicated in the feedback, the legend of Figure 1 of the paper states &#8216;Adverse events included death during the study period but may not have included deaths occurring after patients withdrew from the study.&#8217; This reflects the reality of any clinical trial, in which data are available and included for analysis whilst participants are enrolled, and are often more difficult to collect once participants are withdrawn, despite the best efforts of the investigators. This is still within the scope of an intention to treat analysis. Imputation analysis gives wide confidence intervals for possible effects.</LI>
<LI>In their paper, the investigators provide a satisfactory and complete definition of exacerbation, as &#8216;a symptomatic deterioration requiring treatment with antibiotic agents, systemic corticosteroids, hospitalization, or a combination of these.&#8217; The protocol and paper do not describe that exacerbation data were collected after participant withdrawal.</LI>
<LI>Potential unblinding is a possibility in any study. However, this is not likely to substantially affect the performance of objective outcomes such as mortality and FEV1, or health-related outcomes such as exacerbations treated by antibiotics and/or steroids, or hospitalisation.</LI>
<LI>The investigators stated in advance that linguistically valid SGRQ versions would be analysed, and that the opportunity would be taken to prospectively validate SGRQ in countries without an existing validated version. The power calculation for the study was based on mortality, and therefore did not impact on the SGRQ analysis.</LI>
<LI>Our discussion interprets the pooled quality of life results as &#8216;the magnitude of this benefit was relatively small (MD -1.22 units/year), compared to the minimum clinically significant difference of 4 units with the SGRQ.&#8217;</LI>
</OL>
<P>We have rated the attrition bias as low risk, as both of the ICS and placebo groups had similar rates of attrition. Given this and the other discussions above, we have maintained the current assessment of risk bias for the TORCH study in our review. Once again, we appreciate the detailed feedback that we have received for this review topic in an area of importance for COPD management.</P>
