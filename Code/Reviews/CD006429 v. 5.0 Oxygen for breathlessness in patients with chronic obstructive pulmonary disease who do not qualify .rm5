I have added the RoB blobs to the Figures and moved the comments about the scales in the SoF tables to the left hand column. The SoF table would benefit from fine tuning of the footnotes and comments. I think the ratings are about right, but there is no mention of publication bias (which is suggested in the Funnel plot, but I would not downgrade as taking the outliers away does not change the pooled estimate much). Also sensitivity analysis to leave out studies with any red domains in RoB makes little difference to the pooled outcome in 1.1 as well so may not need a downgrade either. I agree with your downgrade for indirectness (by one point I think) as the assessment was not in the community in most studies, and by another point for imprecision where there are not many studies (again by one point I think) to make the confidence low for most outcomes. I am not sure about the risk of bias down grade as removing the two high risk studies does not make too much difference here either. &lt;b&gt;Please see the word document with my comments and the figures.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Perhaps you could rethink the footnotes&lt;/b&gt; (without feeling you have to change the grade ratings particularly) &lt;b&gt;and to make clear why the exercise test was moderate&lt;/b&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also a bit more in the quality of evidence section to unpack at least the funnel plot would be very helpful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chris&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;PS could you ask Amy to check she is happy with the COI statement too?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Things still to be addressed 180716:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;JRT: ME COI only on form, not added to review text, needs to be updated - Sign-off to check if authorline needs changing, or if OK as is? Amy Abernethy still not submitted - is she still on the authorline?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;JRT: no noticeable change to the Abstract conclusions, but some to Plain Language Summary - should the authors further change the abstract conclusions to reflect this?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;JRT: This point regarding the changes to the Background text - it is unusually short, and doesn't flow that well. 'Description of the intervention' in particular could do with a further update padding out etc, as a Background it doesn't really set the scene for the full review as well as it could do? They have added detail to 'How the interventions might work' primarily, Sign off editor to check&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;JRT: Changes have been made regarding the conclusions text - moving some to the Discussion etc, but Sign-off Editor to check this all looks in order&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;JRT: The consistency between the conclusions is better now, but Sign-off Editor to check&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;JRT: After editorial comments, I notice no Exclusion criteria listed for 'McKeon 1988b'&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;JRT: After editorial comments: I wonder if the Plain Language Summary title could be made more patient-friendly than it currently reads?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;Chris Cates second stats check Jul 14 2016. Thanks for amending the description of subgroups. Looks fine to proceed.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;Phillippa Poole (PP) notes 1 july 2016 + Authors' answers&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I've had a brief look through the review and these notes. Sorry it's a bit time constrained as I'm heading away on leave soon till July 27th.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I agree it is a masterful piece of work, well done all. As I went through I corrected the very occasional typo and made a couple of comments on the review itself. I have added to the comments below where there's something to add.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Answer:&lt;/b&gt; Thank you all for your thorough work and excellent feedback.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, there are two other suggestions:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. It would help the reader to remind them from time to time, and in the discussion, that the effect of oxygen is in comparison to air delivered by the same mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Answer:&lt;/b&gt; This has been added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;JRT&lt;/b&gt;: This seems to be reflected well throughout the review now in various places&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the control is not benign - you have tubing, with air blowing up your nose. Physiologically, it is plausible that mechanical factors reduce breathless or alters breathing pattern, possible by the dive reflex. There aren't many refs to this but maybe use Schwartzstein RM, Lahive K, Pope A, Weinberger SE, Weiss JW. Cold facial stimulation reduces breathlessness induced in normal subjects. Am Rev Respir Dis. 1987 Jul;136(1):58-61.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This may be an explanation of why pts did not prefer to go on, or there was no sig. change in HRQoL. They may have perceived improvement with air, and/ or base their preference on more than relief of dyspnea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Answer:&lt;/b&gt; This, including the suggested reference as well as a relevant recent reference (Johnson et al), have been added to the Mechanism of effect on breathlessness section.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;JRT&lt;/b&gt;: This seems to have been addressed nicely also under the Discussion?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. It would be helpful to point out in methods, or data section how you handled that increasing HRQOL measures on SGRQ are lower - I can see the negative sign, but maybe spell that out a bit more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;See other comments below in Track Changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Answer:&lt;/b&gt; This has been clarified in Data synthesis. We've also gone through the track changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;JRT&lt;/b&gt;: some content re HRQOL added under Measures of treatment effect, but I don't see any under Data synthesis - Sign-off to check happy with the changes?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;CJC notes 29/06/2016&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks for your excellent work on this update. I have not checked all the data entry again, as we have already agreed how this was going to be done in previous correspondence. I have added the test for difference between subgroups, and this should be added to the text for the subgroup results please (as this is the formal test to check if the subgroups are statistically different).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Answer:&lt;/b&gt; Added to the text for all sub-group analyses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was confused by 1.9 as this has two groups so looks like a subgroup not sensitivity. The top group should come out if you just want it to be sensitivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Answer:&lt;/b&gt; Thank you for spotting this; done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;In order to help readers get a grasp of the meaning of the SMDs in the SoF table, it would be really useful to illustrate on the scale that was most often used how big the SD would be and therefore translate the SMD into natural units that can be compared with MID for that scale. PP agree strongly with this suggestion&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;nswer: &lt;/b&gt;Done for each outcome in the SoF table.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;JRT&lt;/b&gt;: CJC has checked changes&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;L&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;iz notes 28/06/2016&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The MECIR standards require a search of ClinicalTrials.gov &amp;amp; the WHO ICTRP (http://apps.who.int/trialsearch/). Please confirm if this was done by the author team. I have added some standard text in to the search methods section. If this wasn't done, I can do it in conjunction with the pre-publication search.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Answer:&lt;/b&gt; Thank you so much Liz for your help with this. The search has been updated, including the WHO portal and ClinicalTrials.gov. The numbers have been updated (hopefully everywhere) in the PRISMA figure and body of text to match the search history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;JRT:&lt;/b&gt; removed descriptive text from Results and directed reader to the tables, also reference to Figure 1 added to 'Results of search'&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;Jessica Thomas 240616&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- We will need to check if Magnus' COIs require a change of the byline - Chris C or Becky N to check?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Answer:&lt;/b&gt; happy to do if needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;JRT: ME COI only on form, not added to review text, needs to be updated - Sign-off to check if authorline needs changing, or if OK as is? Amy Abernethy still not submitted - is she still on the authorline?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Under 'What's new' please make it more clear what the differences are in this review update that warrant it being a 'Conclusions changed' and would justify previous readers re-reading the review. In particular perhaps further expand or make more clear this sentence 'Meta-analysis of health-related quality of life has been performed, showing no consistent of oxygen as compared to medical air.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Answer:&lt;/b&gt; We have expanded that section focusing on novelties in what was analyzed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;JRT:&lt;/b&gt; Changes made, I think these are fine&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Am keen for the Contact Editor to check if they believe this warrants 'conclusions changed' as opposed to just a new citation, ie is the conclusion notably different from the original version?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PP the effect size for dyspnea is much the same, but more robust (more studies). In this update there's a move from no meta analysable evidence of effect in HRQOL, to evidence of no effect. It's a judgement call whether this is 'conclusions changed' - suspect not &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;JRT&lt;/b&gt;: Internally we agreed that this should remain as a Conclusions changed&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Please go to File/Reports/Validation report and address any errors or warnings that come up there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Answer:&lt;/b&gt; Done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;JRT:&lt;/b&gt; All good now&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- To the review abstract please also detail under Main results how many additional studies and numbers of participants were added in this update.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Answer:&lt;/b&gt; Done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;JRT&lt;/b&gt;: Yes, all added&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- In the Abstract Conclusions, please highlight what this update bring to this review.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Answer:&lt;/b&gt; Done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;JRT: no noticeable change to the Abstract conclusions, but some to Plain Language Summary - should the authors further change the abstract conclusions to reflect this?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Similarly in the Plain Language summary, as you add the headings Emma J encourages below, please highlight the additional amount of studies that were added to this update and what this change means.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Answer:&lt;/b&gt; Done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;JRT:&lt;/b&gt; yes, done&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Please check the revisions to the Background text from the current publication. Although it's good to bring things up-to-date I am a little concerned the change has been a little drastic and may have missed out some important sentences etc from the current published version - see the 'tracked changes' version&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PP there is sufficient rationale for the study. But would like to see more in the discussion as per below.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Please double-check your Results section, I count that you have an additional 16 studies, not 14?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;JRT&lt;/b&gt;:&lt;b&gt; This point not really addressed and the Background is unusually short. They have added detail to 'How the interventions might work' primarily, Sign off editor to check&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Answer: &lt;/b&gt;We've checked, counted and re-counted and think it's an additional 14 compared with Uronis 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;JRT&lt;/b&gt;: OK&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- I think the included studies which have 'group 1' and 'group 2' after them should perhaps instead be labelled as 'a' and 'b'?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Answer:&lt;/b&gt; Done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;JRT&lt;/b&gt;: Great&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- I wonder if some of the content you add in the Conclusions, as some of it is being said for the first time should instead be written in the Discussion and summarised more briefly in the Conclusion?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PP I agree with putting more into the background or discussion, and having fewer conclusions. Please also consider discussing the control a bit more, and compare with other metaaanalysies/ reviews. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Answer:&lt;/b&gt; Text chunks have been moved from conclusions to other parts of the discussion. Comparison with other review(s) has been added. The conclusion is clearly focused around the implications for practice and research, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;JRT: Changes have been made, but Sign-off Editor to check this all looks in order&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Please check all of your conclusions for consistency between Plain Language Summary, Abstract and main text conclusions - at the moment I think the information they all share is inconsistent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Answer:&lt;/b&gt; We've gone through these sections trying to make them consistent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;JRT: Better now, but Sign-off Editor to check&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Do check 'Differences between protocol and review' I think things like changes to the Background etc could be made and reasonable amounts of changes to the abstract etc&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Answer: &lt;/b&gt;This section now focuses on the differences between the update protocol and the final review.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;JRT: &lt;/b&gt;OK? Sign-off to check&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;Emma J notes for authors 22/6/16:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; I've now activated the headings in the Background and copy &amp;amp; pasted most of the Background sections into the relevant sections. Please check and add text under 'How the intervention might work'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Answer:&lt;/b&gt; Thank you. That section has been updated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;JRT&lt;/b&gt;: all sections completed&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2 &lt;/b&gt;I've activated the following headings. Please complete these sections now: Measures of treatment effect, Dealing with missing data, Assessment of heterogeneity, Assessment of reporting biases, Results of the search, Included studies, Excluded studies, Other potential source of bias, Overall completeness and applicability of evidence, Agreements and disagreements with other studies or reviews.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Answer:&lt;/b&gt; These sections have now been populated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;JRT:&lt;/b&gt; All sections completed&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt; Please completed the missing info for these references:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Peters 2006 &amp;#8211; missing authors; Sforza 2010 missing info&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Answer: &lt;/b&gt;Done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;JRT&lt;/b&gt;: Seems to be OK now&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt; The plain language summary is not Cochrane PLEACS compliant - please see here for details - http://editorial-unit.cochrane.org/sites/editorial-unit.cochrane.org/files/uploads/PLEACS_website%2012.12.19.pdf&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- suggested headings are: Review Question.&amp;#8226; Background.&amp;#8226; Study characteristics. &amp;#8226; Key results.&amp;#8226; Quality of the evidence&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Answer:&lt;/b&gt; This has been reformatted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;JRT&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;: Corrected&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;5&lt;/b&gt; PRISMA doesn't match the text in Results of the search.

<DESCRIPTION>
<P>This review update added14 studies including 493 participants to the review. With the addition of these studies, the precision of the main analyses has been improved. Several new subanalyses have been performed, including level of desaturation during exercise, setting (laboratory or daily life), short-term versus long-term effects, type of measurement (iso-time or maximal exertion) and oxygen dose. We graded the quality of evidence and were able to meta-analyse data for health-related quality of life.</P>

<P>
<B>Review question</B>
</P>
<P>We reviewed the evidence regarding effects of oxygen compared with air on breathlessness in people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with only mildly or moderately decreased blood oxygen levels.</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>People with COPD are sometimes prescribed oxygen therapy to reduce the severity of breathlessness. However, the use of oxygen in people who do not have severely reduced levels of oxygen in their bloodstream remains controversial, as little is known about its effectiveness. Additionally, oxygen is relatively costly and is not given without risk, particularly to smokers because of the risk of fire.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>We examined the research published to 12 July 2016. We included studies of oxygen therapy versus air delivered through nasal prongs or mask during exertion, continuously, 'as needed' over a defined period or as short-burst oxygen before exertion. Study participants were 18 years of age or older, had received a diagnosis of COPD, had low oxygen levels in the blood and did not receive long-term oxygen therapy. We included a total of 44 studies (1195 participants) in this review. Compared with the previous review, which was published in 2011, we have added 14 studies (493 participants) to this review.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>We found that oxygen can modestly reduce breathlessness. To be effective, oxygen has to be given during exercise. Most studies evaluated oxygen given during exercise testing in the laboratory. Oxygen therapy during daily life had uncertain effects on breathlessness and did not clearly change patient quality of life.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
</P>
<P>We rated the quality of evidence using one of the following grades: very low, low, moderate or high. For very low-quality evidence, we were uncertain about the results. With high-quality evidence, we were very certain about the results. We found that evidence for oxygen given for breathlessness was moderate to low. We are moderately confident that oxygen can relieve breathlessness when given during exercise to people with COPD with mildly or moderately decreased blood oxygen levels. However, most studies reported acute effects during an exercise test, and no evidence suggests that oxygen decreases breathlessness during daily life. Findings indicate that oxygen does not affect health-related quality of life.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2016-11-17 11:39:43 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Breathlessness is a cardinal symptom of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Long-term oxygen therapy (LTOT) is given to improve survival time in people with COPD and severe chronic hypoxaemia at rest. The efficacy of oxygen therapy for breathlessness and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in people with COPD and mild or no hypoxaemia who do not meet the criteria for LTOT has not been established.</P>

<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2016-11-17 11:40:10 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>To determine the efficacy of oxygen versus air in mildly hypoxaemic or non-hypoxaemic patients with COPD in terms of (1) breathlessness; (2) HRQOL; (3) patient preference whether to continue therapy; and (4) oxygen-related adverse events.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2016-11-17 11:40:10 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Airways Group Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE and Embase, to 12 July 2016, for randomised controlled trials (RCTs). We handsearched the reference lists of included articles.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2016-11-17 11:40:10 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included RCTs of the effects of non-invasive oxygen versus air on breathlessness, HRQOL or patient preference to continue therapy among people with COPD and mild or no hypoxaemia (partial pressure of oxygen (PaO<SUB>2</SUB>) &gt; 7.3 kPa) who were not already receiving LTOT. Two review authors independently assessed articles for inclusion in the review.</P>

<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2016-11-17 11:40:29 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two review authors independently collected and analysed data. We assessed risk of bias by using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias tool'. We pooled effects recorded on different scales as standardised mean differences (SMDs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using random-effects models. Lower SMDs indicated decreased breathlessness and reduced HRQOL. We performed subanalyses and sensitivity analyses and assessed the quality of evidence according to the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations (GRADE) approach.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-08-11 14:40:35 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Magnus Ekström">
<P>Compared with the previous review, which was published in 2011, we included 14 additional studies (493 participants), excluded one study and included data for meta-analysis of HRQOL. In total, we included in this review 44 studies including 1195 participants, and we included 33 of these (901 participants)in the meta-analysis.</P>
<P>We found that breathlessness during exercise or daily activities was reduced by oxygen compared with air (32 studies; 865 participants; SMD -0.31, 95% CI -0.43 to -0.20; I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 29%; low-quality evidence). This translates to a decrease in breathlessness of about 0.7 points on a 0 to 10 numerical rating scale. In contrast, we found no effect of short-burst oxygen given before exercise (four studies; 90 participants; SMD -0.03, 95% CI -0.28 to 0.22; I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 0%; low-quality evidence). Oxygen reduced breathlessness measured during exercise tests (30 studies; 591 participants; SMD -0.34, 95% CI -0.46 to -0.22; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 29%; moderate-quality evidence), whereas evidence of an effect on breathlessness measured in daily life was limited (two studies; 274 participants; SMD -0.13, 95% CI, -0.37 to 0.11; I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 0%; low-quality evidence).</P>
<P>Oxygen did not clearly affect HRQOL (five studies; 267 participants; SMD 0.12, 95% CI -0.04 to 0.28; I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 0%; low-quality evidence). Patient preference and adverse events could not be analysed owing to insufficient data.</P>

<P>We are moderately confident that oxygen can relieve breathlessness when given during exercise to mildly hypoxaemic and non-hypoxaemic people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease who would not otherwise qualify for home oxygen therapy.

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2016-11-17 11:42:38 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2016-11-17 11:42:01 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Breathlessness, a cardinal symptom of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), is distressing to both patients and caregivers. Breathlessness is defined as "a subjective experience of breathing discomfort that consists of qualitatively distinct sensations that vary in intensity" (<LINK REF="REF-Parshall-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parshall 2012</LINK>). Breathlessness is multi-factorial (<LINK REF="REF-Laviolette-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Laviolette 2014</LINK>) and arises as a combination of underlying pathologies involving neural pathways and subjective central perception (<LINK REF="REF-Parshall-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parshall 2012</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2016-11-17 11:42:01 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Treatment of patients with breathlessness includes management of the underlying cause(s). However, breathlessness often persists despite optimal management of underlying disease(s), that is, chronic breathlessness. Pharmacological treatment with the strongest evidence base for relieving breathlessness consists of low-dose opioids (<LINK REF="REF-Ekstrom-2015a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ekstrom 2015a</LINK>). People with insufficiently relieved breathlessness are then left to try any of a number of interventions for which evidence is limited, such as supplemental oxygen therapy.</P>
<P>Supplemental oxygen therapy most often is administered through nasal prongs or a mask and may be prescribed continuously, during exercise or as a short burst before exercise (<LINK REF="REF-Hardinge-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hardinge 2015</LINK>). Oxygen sources include oxygen concentrators (which concentrate oxygen from ambient air), cylinders of compressed oxygen and flasks of liquid oxygen. Equipment can be stationary in the home and/or portable (<LINK REF="REF-Hardinge-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hardinge 2015</LINK>).</P>
<P>Long-term oxygen therapy (LTOT) refers to oxygen given for 15 or more hours per day to prolong survival time in people with COPD and chronic severe resting hypoxaemia (partial pressure of oxygen (PaO<SUB>2</SUB>) &lt; 7.4 kPa) or moderate hypoxaemia (PaO<SUB>2</SUB> 7.4 to 7.8 kPa), together with signs of right-sided heart failure or secondary polycythemia (<LINK REF="REF-Cranston-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cranston 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-MRCWP-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">MRCWP 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NOTTG-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">NOTTG 1980</LINK>). Studies in severe hypoxaemia have not evaluated whether LTOT relieves breathlessness or improves health-related quality of life (HRQOL) (<LINK REF="REF-Cranston-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cranston 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>Palliative oxygen therapy refers to supplemental oxygen given to relieve symptoms in people with COPD who have no to moderate hypoxaemia.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2016-11-17 11:42:18 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Oxygen given before or during physical activity might increase oxygen content of and oxygen delivery to exercising muscles. This might prolong aerobic metabolism during exertion and may decrease muscle fatigue and formation of lactic acid (<LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Donnell-2001" TYPE="STUDY">O'Donnell 2001</LINK>), which could lead to a decreased level of ventilatory drive and increased ventilatory capacity at a given work rate, thereby decreasing the mismatch between ventilatory drive and work and perceived severity of breathlessness (<LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Donnell-2001" TYPE="STUDY">O'Donnell 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Parshall-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parshall 2012</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2016-11-17 11:42:38 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>A Cochrane review of the efficacy of palliative oxygen for breathlessness was published in 2011 (<LINK REF="REF-Uronis-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Uronis 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Uronis-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Uronis 2015</LINK>). A meta-analysis of 18 trials (431 participants) reported that supplemental oxygen during exercise and activities reduced breathlessness to a greater extent than air. Short-burst oxygen before exercise did not decrease breathlessness. Review authors could not analyse HRQOL because data were insufficient. Most evidence pertained to exercise testing performed in the laboratory setting (<LINK REF="REF-Uronis-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Uronis 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Uronis-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Uronis 2015</LINK>). A subsequent Cochrane review of four studies (331 participants) suggested that longer-term treatment with ambulatory oxygen relieves breathlessness more effectively than air after exercise in people with COPD (<LINK REF="REF-Ameer-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ameer 2014</LINK>). Current guidelines do not recommend palliative oxygen therapy in COPD, as evidence on treatment in the domiciliary and daily life setting remains insufficient (<LINK REF="REF-Ekstrom-2015b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ekstrom 2015b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hardinge-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hardinge 2015</LINK>). Despite this, palliative oxygen therapy might be commonly prescribed in clinical practice (<LINK REF="REF-Abernethy-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Abernethy 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stringer-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stringer 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>The discrepancy between current clinical practice and available evidence has important implications. First, patients may be prescribed ineffective treatment. Second, oxygen therapy is not a benign intervention. Functional restriction caused by tubing, concentrators or cylinders and the "sick role" may limit quality of life. People also express concern about being reliant on a machine. Nasal cannulae can lead to nasal irritation and can increase the risk of nosebleeds. Oxygen therapy carries a fire risk, particularly for smokers (<LINK REF="REF-Robb-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Robb 2003</LINK>). Serious burn injuries seem infrequent in LTOT with strict adherence to eligibility criteria and contraindications, including smoking cessation (<LINK REF="REF-Tanash-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tanash 2015</LINK>). A small but increased risk of exacerbated hypercarbia is possible, and home oxygen therapy is relatively expensive. If patients do not meet the criteria for LTOT, they may have to pay for oxygen therapy themselves or may receive it on compassionate use grounds (<LINK REF="REF-Guyatt-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guyatt 2000</LINK>). Improved evidence regarding optimal use of palliative oxygen therapy is needed.</P>
<P>Since the previous Cochrane reviews were published (<LINK REF="REF-Uronis-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Uronis 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Uronis-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Uronis 2015</LINK>), several studies of palliative oxygen therapy have been reported, including some larger trials (<LINK REF="STD-Abernethy-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Abernethy 2010 </LINK>and <LINK REF="STD-Moore-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Moore 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>This is an update of the Cochrane review published in 2011 (<LINK REF="REF-Uronis-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Uronis 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Uronis-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Uronis 2015</LINK>).</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-11-17 13:00:40 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Since the previous version of this review was published in 2011 (<LINK REF="REF-Uronis-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Uronis 2011</LINK>), we have included an additional 14 studies of the effects of oxygen versus air on breathlessness, we have excluded one study, and data for meta-analysis of health-related quality of life (HRQOL) are now available.</P>
<P>When compared with air, continuous oxygen (not short-burst oxygen) reduced breathlessness more during exercise or activity (standard mean difference (SMD) -0.36, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.48 to -0.24), and most data pertaining to breathlessness were obtained during exercise testing in the laboratory setting. This effect translated to a mean decrease in breathlessness of 0.7 points on a 0 to 10 numerical rating scale (NRS) based on data from a recent large study (<LINK REF="STD-Abernethy-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Abernethy 2010</LINK>). The minimal clinically important difference in chronic breathlessness has been reported to be 1 point, with small, moderate and large effects seen at about 0.6, 1.1 and 1.8 points, respectively (<LINK REF="REF-Johnson-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnson 2013</LINK>). It is unclear whether the effect of oxygen on breathlessness could be clinically meaningful for many participants in this setting.<BR/>
</P>
<P>Evidence for breathlessness pertains mostly to acute effects of exercise testing on breathlessness in the laboratory setting. Effects on breathlessness during daily life (not measured during an exercise test) in the domiciliary setting were smaller and were statistically non-significant (SMD -0.13, 95% CI -0.37 to 0.11).</P>
<P>Short-burst oxygen therapy before exertion did not affect breathlessness.</P>
<P>Oxygen did not clearly affect HRQOL (SMD 0.10, 95% CI -0.06 to 0.26). Blinded patient preference to continue therapy did not differ between groups given oxygen and groups given air. Investigators insufficiently reported adverse events, and we could not meta-analyse adverse event data.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2016-11-17 13:00:48 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>After an extensive database and literature search, we included 44 studies (1195 participants) in this update review. Although two relatively large studies of ambulatory oxygen have been published in recent years (<LINK REF="STD-Abernethy-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Abernethy 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moore-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Moore 2011</LINK>), additional high-quality data on effects of ambulatory oxygen in daily life, including effects on HRQOL, are needed. Good methodological rigour would include publication of a prespecified protocol outlining trial design, adequate sequence generation, randomisation, blinding (for participants and for outcome assessors) and transparent reporting of appropriate outcomes at baseline in a format suitable for meta-analysis (e.g. mean with standard deviation and sample size).<BR/>
</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Mechanism of effect on breathlessness</HEADING>
<P>The likely mechanism underpinning an effect on breathlessness is that supplemental oxygen prevents or decreases hypoxaemia during exercise, thereby reducing a hypoxaemia-related increase in ventilatory demand, dynamic hyperinflation and increased exertional breathlessness in some patients (<LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Donnell-2001" TYPE="STUDY">O'Donnell 2001</LINK>). This mechanism is supported by the present finding that a higher oxygen dose (&gt; 2 L/min) was associated with a larger decrease in breathlessness. The finding that the oxygen effect was not stronger in studies of patients with exertional desaturation might reflect that the analysis was based on the study mean, and that heterogeneity in the level of exertional hypoxaemia among individual participants might have attenuated the association. Some people developed hypoxaemia during exercise despite supplemental oxygen therapy that could have increased their breathlessness scores. The issue is further complicated in that some patients might have adapted to exertional hypoxaemia, with a reduced ventilatory response to hypoxaemia and therefore less benefit of oxygen during exercise. Another hypothesis is that airflow to the face and upper airways could relieve breathlessness, possibly through increased afferent feedback mimicking increased ventilatory work (<LINK REF="REF-Johnson-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnson 2016</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schwartzstein-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schwartzstein 1987</LINK>). This could reduce the imbalance between ventilatory demand and perceived ventilatory work and thus the level of breathlessness, and may explain why participants did not prefer to go on, or why no significant change in HRQOL was evident when oxygen was compared with air delivered through the same method.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Evidence for use in clinical care</HEADING>
<P>Most evidence of the benefit of oxygen for breathlessness pertains to symptoms noted during standardised exercise testing in the laboratory setting. The oxygen effect during domiciliary treatment in daily life was smaller and more uncertain (SMD -0.12, 95% CI -0.39 to 0.15). More recent double-blinded randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of oxygen compared with medical air have found no statistically or clinically relevant effects of domiciliary/ambulatory oxygen on breathlessness in daily life (<LINK REF="STD-Abernethy-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Abernethy 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moore-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Moore 2011</LINK>). Less efficacy of domiciliary oxygen might reflect insufficient adherence to therapy or low physical activity due to deconditioning, or the fact that breathlessness in daily life is not assessed at a comparable time point or after a standardised workload. A patient who benefits from oxygen (decreased breathlessness at a given workload and improved exercise capacity) might increase his/her activity up to maximal tolerable levels of breathlessness. We found that the level of breathlessness at peak exercise did not seem to be affected by oxygen. When breathlessness is recalled in daily life, reported symptom level might therefore be similar between people receiving oxygen and those given air, even if oxygen would in fact be beneficial in some patients. Whether palliative oxygen in the domiciliary setting is beneficial remains unclear. We found no evidence to show that oxygen improved HRQOL, but the data were limited.</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2016-11-17 13:01:05 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Limitations of this systematic review and meta-analysis mainly reflect the heterogeneity and methodological limitations of the currently available body of literature. Although we excluded studies of participants already qualifying for home oxygen therapy according to current guidelines, the review population still included a wide range of baseline oxygen saturation/partial pressure of oxygen (PaO<SUB>2</SUB>). This variability could affect our results if a relationship is found between oxygen saturation and effects of oxygen on breathlessness. We addressed this issue by performing a subgroup analysis based on baseline PaO<SUB>2</SUB> (&#8805; 9.3 kPa) and obtained consistent findings. Additionally, baseline breathlessness and physical capacity were often insufficiently reported. The review population likely included participants with varied perceptions of breathlessness and physical capacity.</P>
<P>We explored potential bias due to methodological limitations by excluding studies with high risk for any bias category; this yielded consistent findings. A possible limitation of this review is that many studies did not report data on participants dropping out or withdrawing from the study. Reporting of data only for participants who completed the trial might have introduced selection bias.</P>
<P>Palliative oxygen is prescribed most commonly for seriously ill patients nearing the end of life; however, these patients are not likely to participate in randomised trials, especially studies involving an exercise test. The applicability of review findings to all individuals with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who require palliative oxygen is unclear.</P>
<P>Effects of oxygen on breathlessness were driven in part by five outlier findings among studies with small sample sizes/low levels of precision. This asymmetry in the funnel plot might indicate the presence of publication bias. When we excluded the outliers, the oxygen effect became somewhat smaller (SMD -0.24, 95% CI -0.34 to -0.15).</P>
<P>Although the funnel plot indicated potential publication bias, we did not downgrade the quality of the evidence, as a sensitivity analysis excluding outlying studies yielded similar findings.</P>

<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2016-11-17 13:01:05 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Compared with the 2011 version of this review (<LINK REF="REF-Uronis-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Uronis 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Uronis-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Uronis 2015</LINK>), we have included an additional 14 studies (493 participants) in this update. The finding of the main analysis of breathlessness is consistent with the previous estimate but is more precise because we included more studies. Subgroup analyses by short burst and by oxygen dose were also in agreement with those of the previous review. Novel subgroup analyses in the present review show that evidence of effects of oxygen pertains mostly to breathlessness during exercise tests performed in the laboratory standardised rehabilitation training setting. Evidence is less consistent and of low quality for effects of supplemental oxygen during daily life. The novel analysis of HRQOL showed no clear effect of supplemental oxygen compared with air on quality of life.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Ameer-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ameer 2014</LINK> performed a Cochrane meta-analysis (four studies; 331 participants) of the effects of ambulatory oxygen therapy given for two weeks or longer on breathlessness and HRQOL in the home setting. When compared with air or no therapy, ambulatory oxygen therapy was associated with a small reduction in breathlessness as measured on the Borg scale (mean difference 0.28, 95% CI, 0.10 to 0.45). This finding is consistent with our finding in the non-laboratory setting. The analysis of breathlessness performed by <LINK REF="REF-Ameer-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ameer 2014</LINK> included only three studies (<LINK REF="STD-McDonald-1995" TYPE="STUDY">McDonald 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Eaton-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Eaton 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nonoyama-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Nonoyama 2007</LINK>), which we also included in the present review. Effects on HRQOL as noted in <LINK REF="REF-Ameer-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ameer 2014</LINK> were inconsistent, with mean improvements in breathlessness and fatigue domains but were not related to emotional function or mastery. Small or inconsistent effects of supplemental oxygen on HRQOL and lack of clear effect on exercise capacity in <LINK REF="REF-Ameer-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ameer 2014</LINK> support the present conclusion that the evidence base for supplemental oxygen therapy during daily life is limited.</P>
<P>Findings of this review are consistent with recent British Thoracic Society (BTS) guidelines stating that although ambulatory oxygen therapy should be offered to patients for use during exercise in a pulmonary rehabilitation programme, it "should not be routinely offered to patients who are not eligible for LTOT" (<LINK REF="REF-Hardinge-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hardinge 2015</LINK>).</P>

<P>Oxygen given continuously during exercise or activity can relieve breathlessness in patients with COPD who have no or mild hypoxaemia and would not qualify for long-term oxygen therapy. Evidence was of moderate quality for breathlessness during exercise testing in the laboratory setting and of low quality for effects on breathlessness during daily life. It is not clear whether the reduction in breathlessness shown in the laboratory setting translates into a clinically important benefit, and no evidence supports a clinically important benefit from oxygen for breathlessness in daily life. Short-burst oxygen therapy given before exercise had no effect and should not be used.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Clinical recommendations</HEADING>
<P>Based on the present findings, supplemental oxygen therapy is not a first-line treatment for patients with breathlessness. Management of underlying disease(s) should be optimised. Evidence-based symptomatic treatment should include individualised rehabilitation training (<LINK REF="REF-McCarthy-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">McCarthy 2015</LINK>), the fan and low-dose opioids (<LINK REF="REF-Ekstrom-2015a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ekstrom 2015a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ekstrom-2015b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ekstrom 2015b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hardinge-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hardinge 2015</LINK>). In patients with intractable breathlessness despite these interventions, a trial of supplemental oxygen could be considered. Guidelines recommend that palliative oxygen should be evaluated only in patients with hypoxaemia (saturation &lt; 92%) at rest (<LINK REF="REF-Hardinge-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hardinge 2015</LINK>). We found that the oxygen effect was similar in studies with mean PaO<SUB>2</SUB> &#8805; 9.3 kPa compared with PaO<SUB>2</SUB> &lt; 9.3 kPa, and that a trial of supplemental oxygen might be reasonable in patients without resting hypoxaemia, especially in the presence of hypoxaemia during limited exertion. Evaluation of the potential benefit of ambulatory oxygen should involve the patient's levels of physical capacity and activity, along with the benefits of oxygen for breathlessness and physical capacity in a standardised test such as the six-minute walking test (6MWT) when compared with air (<LINK REF="REF-Hardinge-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hardinge 2015</LINK>). Patients who perceive decreased breathlessness when receiving oxygen most often experience this effect within two to three days of the start of treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Abernethy-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Abernethy 2010</LINK>). Therefore, palliative oxygen therapy should be evaluated after a few days and withdrawn if patients do not perceive benefit.</P>
<P>Patient quality of life (QOL) factors such as convenience and adverse consequences should be considered in the decision whether to prescribe oxygen as treatment for patients with breathlessness who may already be burdened by their illness and other life changes prominent in the advanced illness setting.</P>
<P>Finally, in considering these results, one must be sure to remember the downsides of administering oxygen. Oxygen is costly, and, with current stresses on healthcare systems in many countries, this needs to be taken into account. Evidence of the effect of supplemental oxygen on HRQOL is lacking.</P>
<P>In conclusion, we are moderately confident that oxygen can relieve breathlessness when given during exercise to mildly hypoxaemic and non-hypoxaemic people with COPD who would not otherwise qualify for home oxygen therapy. Most evidence pertains to acute effects during exercise testing; evidence of long-term effects of oxygen during daily life is less consistent. Findings show that oxygen did not affect HRQOL.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2016-11-17 13:01:24 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Current findings on the effect of oxygen therapy versus air have several important implications for research. First, oxygen affected breathlessness measured only at iso-time, not at peak exercise. This confirms the importance of measuring breathlessness at iso-time with comparable workloads in mechanistic studies and interventional trials.</P>
<P>Although this review confirms that oxygen can decrease exertional breathlessness in the laboratory setting, studies should focus on effects of domiciliary and ambulatory oxygen in clinical and daily life settings. Studies on effects of oxygen on HRQOL and on different aspects (dimensions) of breathlessness (<LINK REF="REF-Laviolette-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Laviolette 2014</LINK>) are needed, and investigators should identify optimal doses and routes of oxygen administration, while determining which patients are most likely to receive beneficial symptomatic effects of oxygen. Studies of symptomatic benefit should also account for changes in physical capacity and activity to explore whether oxygen given during daily living could allow increased exercise activity, although it might not affect reported breathlessness scores. Tools for measuring physical activity in COPD were recently validated (<LINK REF="REF-Gimeno_x002d_Santos-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gimeno-Santos 2015</LINK>).</P>
<P>We found that adverse events were insufficiently assessed and/or reported. The first population-based longitudinal study of the risk of burn injury during LTOT was published only recently (<LINK REF="REF-Tanash-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tanash 2015</LINK>). Studies quantifying adverse events, patient burden and potential risks associated with supplemental oxygen therapy are needed to determine the net clinical benefit of palliative oxygen.</P>
