<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2016-01-11 09:23:30 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>
<B>Background</B>:<BR/>Bedwetting (nocturnal enuresis or enuresis) is the involuntary loss of urine during sleep without being caused by a physical disorder. It can result in social, emotional and psychological problems and lower quality of life. It affects around 15% to 20% of five-year-olds, and can persist in up to 2% of adults. Many different types of drugs have been used to treat bedwetting, both as a single treatment and in combination with other treatments. Tricyclics are antidepressants, which have been used for treating bedwetting since the 1960s. They probably work by their antispasmodic effect on the bladder. This review examines 64 trials of tricyclic drugs, involving 4071 children.</P>
<P>
<B>Main findings</B>:<BR/>The most commonly used tricyclic for treating bedwetting is imipramine. Compared to placebo, tricyclics reduce bedwetting by about one night per week during treatment and about a fifth of the children achieve 14 dry nights. However, most wet again once the tricyclics are stopped.</P>
<P>
<B>Adverse effects:</B>
<BR/>Tricyclics are just as effective as the other commonly-used drug, desmopressin. However, they have more side effects, such as seizures, effects on the heart, liver and blood including low white cell counts, particularly if overdosed, which can be serious. The available evidence suggests that bedwetting alarms are a more effective treatment for bedwetting than tricyclics, and do not have the side effects. They also have a more sustained effect after stopping, but they require more effort by the child and more support by their families to be effective.</P>
<P>
<B>Limitations</B>:<BR/>Most of the studies included in the review are old (latest 2008), small and of low quality, with insufficient information to judge the risk of bias. The evidence in this review is current up to 30 November 2015.</P>

<P>Enuresis (bedwetting) affects up to 20% of five year-olds and 2% of adults. Although spontaneous remission often occurs, the social, emotional and psychological costs can be great. Tricyclics have been used to treat enuresis since the 1960s.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2015-12-04 05:59:47 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>To assess the effects of tricyclic and related drugs compared with other interventions for treating children with enuresis.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2016-01-11 09:19:26 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Incontinence Group Specialised Trials Register (containing trials identified from the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, MEDLINE in process, ClinicalTrials.gov, WHO ICTRP and handsearching of journals and conference proceedings), on 30 November 2015, and reference lists of relevant articles.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2015-11-30 21:55:21 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included all randomised and quasi-randomised trials comparing a tricyclic or related drug with another intervention for treating enuresis. We also included combination therapies that included tricyclics. We excluded trials for treating daytime wetting.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2015-11-30 21:55:29 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two review authors independently assessed the quality of the eligible trials, and extracted data. We settled differences by discussion with a third review author.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-01-08 16:06:54 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Sixty-four trials met the inclusion criteria, involving 4071 children. The quality of many trials was poor, with comparisons addressed by single studies. Minor adverse effects were common, and reported in 30 trials. These included dizziness, headache, mood changes, gastrointestinal discomforts and neutropenia. More serious side-effects can occur but were not reported. Seven trials reported no adverse effects.</P>
<P>Tricyclics are more effective than placebo, particularly for short-term outcomes. Compared to placebo, imipramine resulted in one fewer wet nights per week (mean difference (MD) -0.95, 95% confidence interval (CI) -1.40 to -0.50; 4 trials, 347 children), with fewer failing to achieve 14 consecutive dry nights (78% versus 95% for placebo, RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.61 to 0.90; 12 trials, 831 children). Amitriptyline and desipramine were more effective than placebo, but nortriptyline and mianserin showed no difference. Most tricyclics did not have a sustained effect after ceasing treatment, with 96% wetting at follow-up for imipramine versus 97% for placebo.</P>
<P>Imipramine combined with oxybutynin is also more effective than placebo, with 33% failing to achieve 14 consecutive dry nights at the end of treatment versus 78% for placebo (RR 0.43, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.78; 1 trial, 47 children) and 45% wetting at follow-up versus 79% for placebo (RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.99; 1 trial, 36 children).</P>
<P>There was insufficient evidence to judge the effect between different doses of tricyclics, and between different tricyclics. Treatment outcomes between tricyclic and desmopressin were similar, but were mixed when tricyclic was compared with an anticholinergic. However, when imipramine was compared with desmopressin plus oxybutynin (1 trial, 45 children), the combination therapy was more effective, with one fewer wet nights per week (MD 1.07, 95% CI 0.06 to 2.08) and 36% failing to achieve 14 consecutive dry nights versus 87% for imipramine (RR 2.39, 95% CI 1.35 to 4.25). Tricyclics were also more effective or showed no difference in response when compared to other drugs which are no longer used for enuresis.</P>
<P>Tricyclics were less effective than alarms. Although there was no difference in the number of wet nights, 67% failed to achieve 14 consecutive dry nights for imipramine versus only 17% for alarms (RR 4.00, 95% CI 1.06 to 15.08; 1 trial, 24 children). Alarm therapy also had a more sustained effect after ceasing treatment with 100% on imipramine versus 58% on alarms wetting at follow-up (RR 1.67, 95% CI 1.03 to 2.69; 1 trial, 24 children).</P>
<P>Imipramine was more effective than simple behavioural therapies during treatment, with one fewer wet nights per week compared with star chart plus placebo (MD -0.80, 95% CI -1.33 to -0.27; 1 trial, 250 children). At follow-up 40% were wet with imipramine versus 80% with fluids and avoiding punishment (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.89; 1 trial, 40 children). However, imipramine was less effective than complex behavioural therapies, with 61% failing to achieve 14 consecutive dry nights for imipramine versus 33% for the three-step programme (RR 1.83, 95% CI 1.08 to 3.12; 1 trial, 72 children) and 16% for the three-step programme combined with motivational therapy and computer-led education (RR 3.91, 95% CI 2.30 to 6.66; 1 trial, 132 children) at the end of treatment, with similar results at follow-up.</P>
<P>Tricyclics were more effective than restricted diet, with 99% failing to achieve 14 consecutive dry nights versus 84% for imipramine (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.75 to 0.93; 1 trial, 147 children).There was insufficient evidence to judge the effect of tricyclics compared to the other miscellaneous interventions studied.</P>
<P>At the end of treatment there were about two fewer wet nights for imipramine plus oxybutynin compared with imipramine monotherapy (MD -2.10, 95% CI -2.99 to -1.21; 1 trial, 63 children) and 48% on imipramine plus oxybutynin failed to achieve 14 consecutive dry nights compared with 74% on imipramine monotherapy (RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.50 to 0.92; 2 trials, 101 children). At follow-up, 45% on imipramine plus oxybutynin were wetting versus 83% on imipramine monotherapy (RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.92; 1 trial, 36 children).</P>
<P>When imipramine combined with desmopressin was compared with imipramine monotherapy, there was no difference in outcomes. However, when imipramine plus desmopressin was compared with desmopressin monotherapy, the combination was more effective, with 15% not achieving 14 consecutive dry nights at the end of treatment for imipramine plus desmopressin versus 40% for desmopressin monotherapy (RR 0.38, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.83; 1 trial, 86 children). Tricyclics combined with alarm therapy were not more effective than alarm monotherapy, alarm combined with desmopressin or alarm combined with nortriptyline. The addition of a tricyclic to other behavioural therapies did not alter treatment response.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2016-01-02 12:07:59 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There was evidence that tricyclics are effective at reducing the number of wet nights during treatment, but do not have a sustained effect after treatment stops, with most children relapsing. In contrast, there was evidence that alarm therapy has better short- and long-term outcomes. There was some evidence that tricyclics combined with anticholinergics may be more effective that tricyclic monotherapy.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2016-01-11 09:28:08 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Nocturnal enuresis is the involuntary loss of urine at night, in the absence of organic disease, at an age when a child could reasonably be expected to be dry (by consensus, at a developmental age of five years) (<LINK REF="REF-APA-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">APA 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Austin-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Austin 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1992</LINK>). Enuresis can affect the child's quality of life and self esteem, and impact on their social, emotional and psychological well being (<LINK REF="REF-Deshpande-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deshpande 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hagglof-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hagglof 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>With improved understanding about the pathophysiology of nocturnal enuresis and the promotion by the International Children's Continence Society (ICCS) for using standardised nomenclature in paediatric continence research (<LINK REF="REF-Austin-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Austin 2014</LINK>), enuresis is now subclassified as either monosymptomatic (bedwetting only) or non-monosymptomatic (bedwetting with lower urinary tract symptoms in the presence or absence of daytime urinary incontinence), as the pathophysiology and treatment for both are different. However, many of the older studies did not distinguish between these groups.</P>
<P>The ICCS has also defined treatment outcomes in terms of initial change in frequency of wetting (non-response is less than 50% reduction in frequency of wetting, partial response is 50% to 99% reduction, and complete response is 100% reduction), relapse (more than one symptom recurrence per month after cessation of treatment) and duration of treatment success (continued success is no relapse six months after cessation of treatment, and complete success is no relapse after two years) (<LINK REF="REF-Austin-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Austin 2014</LINK>). Unfortunately, most of the older studies have not assessed these outcomes or were unclear about their definition of success. As this is an update of previous systematic reviews where treatment outcomes were measured in predefined ways which did not use standardised ICCS definitions, we have continued to use the same outcomes for this update that were used in the previous reviews. There were no studies that included two-year follow-up and we therefore could not assess long-term complete success.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Prevalences and causes</HEADING>
<P>Nocturnal enuresis is common in children. Estimating the prevalence of nocturnal enuresis is difficult because there is variation in the diagnostic criteria, with very few studies using ICCS definitions (<LINK REF="REF-Austin-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Austin 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-De-Jonge-1973" TYPE="REFERENCE">De Jonge 1973</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Krantz-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Krantz 1994</LINK>). The generally quoted prevalence rates are 15% to 20% of five-year-olds, 7% of seven-year-olds, 5% of 10-year-olds, 2% to 3% of teenagers and 0.5% to 2% of adults, with a yearly spontaneous remission rate of 14% until adolescence (<LINK REF="REF-Blackwell-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blackwell 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Forsythe-1974" TYPE="REFERENCE">Forsythe 1974</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rutter-1973" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rutter 1973</LINK>). The prevalence of nocturnal enuresis is higher amongst children in residential care (<LINK REF="REF-Morgan-1970" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morgan 1970</LINK>) and is more persistent in those who have severe enuresis (<LINK REF="REF-Yeung-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yeung 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Butler-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Butler 2000</LINK> proposed the conceptual model that nocturnal enuresis occurs when there is a defective arousal response during sleep to the sensation of a full bladder, a lack of inhibition of bladder emptying during sleep or excessive nocturnal urine production.

<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2016-01-08 16:06:59 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Interventions</HEADING>
<P>Pharmacological, behavioural and a variety of other interventions have been used to treat enuresis (<LINK REF="REF-Neveus-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Neveus 2010</LINK>). Our review is restricted to interventions that were compared with a tricyclic or a drug related to tricyclics.</P>
<P>Tricyclic drugs and drugs related to tricyclics used for enuresis which we include in this review were amitriptyline, clomipramine, desipramine, imipramine, mianserin, nortriptyline and viloxazine, although some of these are now contraindicated. Tricyclics were compared with placebo, with different doses of the same tricyclic, with another tricyclic or a related drug (clomipramine, mianserin, nortriptyline and viloxazine) or drugs other then tricyclics, such as amphetamine, chlordiazepoxide, desmopressin, diazepam, emepronium, ephedrine sulphate, furosemide, hydroxyzine, meprobamate, oxybutynin, piracetam and tolterodine.</P>
<P>Behavioural interventions that were compared with a tricyclic drug include alarm training, star charts, random waking, three-step therapy (which includes reassurance, retention control training and waking), counselling and education, shaming, and fluid restriction with avoidance of punishment. Tricyclics were also compared with hypnotherapy, psychotherapy and a restricted diet.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Tricyclic drugs</HEADING>
<P>Tricyclic drugs have been used for treating nocturnal enuresis for over 50 years. They are now considered a third-line therapy for enuresis.</P>
<P>The tricyclic drug most commonly used for enuresis is imipramine. The recommended age-/weight-related dosages range from 25 mg for six-year-olds (weight 20 to 25 kg) to 50 to 75 mg for those over 11 years. Imipramine should not be given to children under six years of age and the dose should not exceed 75 mg daily. The maximum period of treatment should not exceed three months and withdrawal of medication needs to be gradual. Electrocardiograph (ECG) monitoring is recommended and a full physical examination should be given before a further course is prescribed (<LINK REF="REF-BNF-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">BNF 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>Tricyclics have significant adverse effects, including cardiotoxicity, convulsions, and hepatic and haematological reactions, particularly in overdose (<LINK REF="REF-Fitzwater-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fitzwater 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Parkin-1972" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parkin 1972</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rushton-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rushton 1993</LINK>). Serious adverse effects were not reported in any of the included trials except for neutropenia. Minor side effects related to their anticholinergic actions include postural hypotension, dry mouth, constipation, perspiration, tachycardia, nausea, lethargy and insomnia. Other tricyclic drugs (amitriptyline, dothiepin, doxepin and trimipramine) have the same associated risks as imipramine, but have a more sedative effect (<LINK REF="REF-BNF-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">BNF 2002</LINK>). Viloxazine is reported to have a less sedative effect than imipramine, with fewer and milder anticholinergic and cardiovascular side effects (<LINK REF="REF-BNF-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">BNF 2002</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Other drugs related to tricyclics</HEADING>
<P>Related drugs included in this review have similar actions to the tricyclics but fewer side effects. Viloxazine is a bicyclic antidepressant and mianserin is a tetracyclic antidepressant. They all inhibit reuptake of noradrenaline, thus increasing functional noradrenaline availability. They have fewer anticholinergic, sedative and cardiotoxic effects than imipramine.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2015-11-30 22:04:44 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Tricyclic drugs act on the central nervous system by blocking the synaptic alpha receptor reuptake of noradrenaline and serotonin into the neurons, thus prolonging their effects. The usual clinical use of tricyclics is as an antidepressant. They also have anticholinergic or antispasmodic effects on the bladder and other parts of the body, local anaesthetic properties and effects on the sleep centre in the brain, which may improve arousability (<LINK REF="REF-Warzak-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Warzak 1994</LINK>). The beneficial effect of imipramine was initially attributed to its anticholinergic effects, but it has been recently shown that imipramine can be helpful even in children who have not responded to anticholinergic therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Gepertz-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gepertz 2004</LINK>), suggesting that another mechanism of action may also contribute to its effectiveness.</P>

<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2016-01-08 16:07:00 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Although enuresis in itself is pathologically benign and has a high rate of spontaneous remission, it can affect the child's quality of life and self esteem, and can impact on their social, emotional and psychological well-being (<LINK REF="REF-Deshpande-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deshpande 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hagglof-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hagglof 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Joinson-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Joinson 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Von-Gontard-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Von Gontard 2011</LINK>), persisting into adulthood with long-term effects (<LINK REF="REF-Fitzwater-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fitzwater 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Yeung-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yeung 2004</LINK>). Enuresis affects the whole family, and children with enuresis may experience parental disapproval, sibling teasing and be at risk of increased emotional and physical abuse (<LINK REF="REF-Warzak-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Warzak 1992</LINK>). Consequently it is important to identify effective interventions for treating enuresis, as effective treatment can improve self esteem (<LINK REF="REF-Hagglof-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hagglof 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>It is also important to assess the effectiveness of tricyclics against other known treatments, both as monotherapy or in combination with other treatments, given the potential risk of side effects for tricyclics compared with other effective treatments.</P>

<P>The unit of allocation was the individual participant.</P>
<P>We have indicated cross-over trials by a suffix hash (#) after the trial ID. For cross-over trials, we would have calculated data from paired comparisons to provide information for generic inverse variance analysis, but none of the trials provided suitable data. Rather than put the data available in 'Other Data' tables we chose to tabulate the data as if they were parallel groups. This approach leads to wider confidence intervals; hence statistically significant results using a parallel-group approach would be significant if correctly analysed as cross-over studies, but nonsignificant results might hide a significant difference. We conducted a sensitivity analysis excluding them, to check whether their inclusion materially changed the findings. However, if data were provided from the first arm of the trial, we included them as if the data came from parallel groups; in this case we did not use the suffix hash and did not exclude them in the sensitivity analysis.</P>

<P>Where there were missing outcome data in the included studies, the primary analysis used the number of participants with available data as the denominator (i.e. 'available case' analysis). We also attempted to contact the authors. If there was evidence of differential dropouts from the groups which may have been caused by adverse effects of the interventions or ineffectiveness, we mentioned this in the 'Risk of bias' table.

<P>This review includes 4071 children (mean study size n = 66, range 7 to 298), in which 2269 children received a tricyclic. Most of the trials included children aged between five and 16. Two trials included some older participants (<LINK REF="STD-Seo-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Seo 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Liederman-1969" TYPE="STUDY">Liederman 1969</LINK>) and nine trials included a few children under the age of five (<LINK REF="STD-Forsythe-1969" TYPE="STUDY">Forsythe 1969</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Forsythe-1972a" TYPE="STUDY">Forsythe 1972a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Friday-1966" TYPE="STUDY">Friday 1966</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Haegglund-1964" TYPE="STUDY">Haegglund 1964</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lines-1968_x0023_" TYPE="STUDY">Lines 1968#</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Miyazaki-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Miyazaki 1973</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moltke-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Moltke 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schr_x00f6_der-1971" TYPE="STUDY">Schröder 1971</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shah-1971_x0023_" TYPE="STUDY">Shah 1971#</LINK>).

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Interventions</HEADING>
<P>Eight different types of tricyclics (imipramine, amitriptyline, clomipramine, desipramine, nortripryline, trimipramine) or related drugs (mianserin, viloxazine) were used in studies included in this review. They were compared with placebos, with other drugs (including a different dose of the same tricyclic, other tricyclics or related drugs, or other classes of drug), behavioural interventions, and complementary and other miscellaneous treatments.</P>

<P>For cross-over trials, we would have calculated data from paired comparisons to provide information for generic inverse variance analysis, but none of the trials provided suitable data.

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-01-11 09:32:35 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Tricyclics are more effective than placebo or no treatment, particularly for short-term responses. The tricyclics imipramine, amitriptyline and desipramine were more effective than placebo, but we found no difference for nortriptyline and mianserin. Most tricyclics did not have a sustained effect and participants relapsed at follow-up after cessation of treatment. We did not find any studies that included two-year follow-up and therefore could not assess long-term complete success.</P>
<P>There was insufficient evidence to determine whether there was any difference in treatment response between the different doses of tricyclics. When comparing one tricyclic with another, there was no difference in treatment effects between imipramine and nortriptyline, nor between imipramine and viloxazine, but imipramine appears to be superior to mianserin.</P>
<P>There was not much difference between tricyclics and desmopressin, although there was about one fewer wet nights for amitriptyline compared with desmopressin. However, desmopressin combined with oxybutynin was superior to imipramine monotherapy for short-term responses. There were mixed outcomes when comparing tricyclic monotherapy with an anticholinergic monotherapy for short-term responses, with fewer wet nights at the end of treatment for oxybutynin compared to imipramine, but more children achieving 14 consecutive dry nights with imipramine compared to tolterodine.</P>
<P>Alarm therapy was superior to tricyclics, with significantly more children achieving 14 consecutive dry nights, although there was no statistically significant difference in the mean number of wet nights demonstrated. Alarm therapy also had a more sustained response, with 42% dry after cessation of treatment, compared with none after cessation of imipramine.</P>
<P>Overall, tricyclics were more effective than simple behavioural therapies, but less effective than complex behavioural therapies. A restrictive diet appears ineffective and there was insufficient evidence to judge the effect of tricyclics compared to the other complementary and miscellaneous interventions.</P>
<P>When tricyclics were combined with other treatments, the combination of a tricyclic with an anticholinergic was superior to both placebo and to tricyclic monotherapy, in both the short and long term. Tricyclics combined with desmopressin were not more effective than tricyclic monotherapy, but were more effective than desmopressin monotherapy. There was no additional benefit of adding a tricyclic to alarm therapy, with no statistically significant difference demonstrated when compared to alarm monotherapy (with or without placebo), alarm combined with desmopressin or alarm combined with nortriptyline.</P>
<P>There were mixed responses when tricyclics were combined with other behavioural therapies, with no additive effect of tricyclics to motivation and bladder exercises, but tricyclics combined with fluid restriction and avoidance of punishment was superior to fluid restriction and avoidance of punishment without tricyclics. There was also no additive effect of fluid restriction and avoidance of punishment to tricyclic therapy.</P>
<P>Adverse effects were mentioned in 30 trials, with seven trials reporting no adverse events. Reported adverse events were usually of minor consequences, but some trials did not give details of the nature or severity of the side effects, and others failed to indicate the treatment arm in which the adverse effects occurred. The frequency of adverse effects for placebo was less than for tricyclics. Adverse effects were reported more frequently for combination therapy when tricyclics were combined with another drug such as desmopressin or oxybutynin. An important adverse effect was the skin damage, including rashes, burns and ulceration caused by the electric shock alarm.</P>

<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2016-01-08 16:09:06 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Enuresis is a common health condition faced by children, and tricyclics were one of the first therapies offered for treating it (<LINK REF="REF-Neveus-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Neveus 2010</LINK>). This review includes 4071 children, with most participants aged between five and 16. The studies were predominantly in an outpatient setting, where children with enuresis are commonly seen. However, seven trials were based in institutional settings and two in community settings.</P>
<P>Many of the studies are quite old, and include some therapies which are now no longer used. We have also studied the effects of combination therapy involving tricyclics as a separate comparison in this review, as combination therapy is increasingly used for treating therapy-resistant enuresis.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2016-01-08 16:09:16 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The 64 trials (including 20 cross-over trials) included in this review were mostly small and of poor quality, with 30 studies having 50 or fewer participants. Most comparisons or outcomes were addressed only by single trials, precluding meta-analysis. The small sample sizes resulted in wide confidence intervals and imprecision which could obscure or overestimate underlying treatment effects; in general the evidence was too poor to identify whether any treatment or combination of treatments was better than any other. Most of the trials had insufficient follow-up, with only 18 studies following participants for at least three months after completion of treatment.</P>
<P>The quality of the trials was often low, with 10 trials not providing any useable data, and 21 trials failing to provide standard deviations for their continuous variables. Because none of the cross-over studies provided suitable data for generic inverse variance analysis, we incorporated cross-over studies and analysed them as parallel-group trials, which carries the risk of a unit-of-analysis error. None of the trials met all the criteria for a good-quality study at low risk of bias. The risk of bias in many studies was difficult to judge because of insufficient details of methodology.</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2016-01-08 16:09:19 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Despite our best efforts, we may have missed some published literature. The quality assessment was based on the published study reports. This may have unintentionally downgraded the perceived quality of blinding and allocation concealment if no information was provided. Given the absence of trial registration for most of the trials included in this review, bias due to selective reporting of outcomes was difficult to ascertain.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2016-01-11 09:33:23 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Although tricyclics are effective in reducing enuresis in the short term, they do not have a sustained effect when treatment ceases. Although only minor adverse effects were reported in the included studies, decisions to use these drugs should take account of the uncertainty over potentially serious adverse effects of tricyclics in this population, arising from the insufficent level of detail provided by many of the studies in this review. There is limited, very low-quality evidence that combining tricyclics with other therapies such as anticholinergics may be effective.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2015-11-30 22:08:08 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>As the benefits of tricyclics were relatively small and transient, and there are concerns about safety, further research into their effects is likely to be of limited value. The use of tricyclics as an adjunct to other therapies may warrant further exploration, particularly for children who are resistant to other treatment. Further research is needed to determine which interventions are appropriate for which groups and in which circumstances, in order to guide choice of treatment.</P>
<P>Further research on alternative drugs for enuresis must incorporate comparisons with proven effective treatments such as desmopressin and alarm therapy. Placebo-controlled drug trials without incorporating comparisons with established therapies should be discouraged when proven effective therapies are available. The methodological quality of the trials also needs to be improved, with a focus on adequate sample sizes, length of follow-up, reporting of adverse events and relapse rates and the use uniform outcome measures as defined by the International Children's Continence Society, making a conscious efforts to adopt the ICCS nomenclature guidelines.</P>
<P>Patient-reported outcome measures such as quality of life and other important outcomes such as cost should be reported, to determine the impact of the condition and of the treatment on the child and family, their care providers and on health services. Children with nocturnal enuresis should be included in studies focusing on treatment of night wetting, irrespective of whether they have monosymptomatic or non-monosymptomatic nocturnal enuresis, which will increase the broad applicability of results, but the two groups should be analysed separately. Subgroup analysis of monosymptomatic and non-monosymptomatic groups may provide further knowledge about the different responses to treatment of these subgroups.</P>

<P>For this update, we added a new category of outcome which assessed combination therapies involving tricyclics, and moved all combination therapies previously in the other outcomes to this new outcome category. We also assessed for selective reporting bias in studies by examining whether systematic baseline measurements of enuresis were conducted prior to the start of treatment, whether adverse events were mentioned, whether organic causes of enuresis or daytime urinary incontinence were excluded, whether full data sets were provided, where study protocols were provided, and whether all prespecified outcomes were reported.</P>

<P>10 lost at follow-up of 4 months. 1 from placebo, 4 from buzzer and 5 from imipramine. There was an increase in the no. of wet nights in the imipramine 4-month group. The group also showed a higher loss to follow-up than the others. This was not addressed. May have been that those lost to follow-up were cured, leading to misleadingly high mean no. of wet nights</P>
