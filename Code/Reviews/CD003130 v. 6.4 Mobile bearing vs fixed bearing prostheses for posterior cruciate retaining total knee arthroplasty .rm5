<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2015-01-18 21:42:53 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>
<B>Review question</B>
</P>
<P>We reviewed the evidence on benefits and harms of mobile bearing compared with fixed bearing implants for cruciate retaining total knee replacement in patients with osteoarthritis (OA) or rheumatoid arthritis (RA). We found 19 relevant studies.</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>In some people, damage and pain in the knee from arthritis are so severe that surgery is required. In these people, the joint can be replaced by a knee implant. In total knee replacement surgery, the ends of the long bones of the leg are usually replaced with metal ends, and a plastic insert is placed between them. Like fixed-bearing implants, mobile-bearing implants use three components to provide a relatively natural joint. In a mobile-bearing knee, however, the polyethylene insert can rotate short distances inside the metal tibial tray. This design allows patients a few degrees of greater rotation to the medial and lateral sides of their knee. Compared with fixed bearing designs, mobile bearing knee implants require greater support from soft tissues, such as the ligaments surrounding the knee. If the soft tissues are not strong enough, mobile bearing knees are more likely to dislocate. They also may cost more than fixed bearing implants.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>On 27 February 2014, we found 19 studies that tested 1641 people with OA or RA. After surgery, these people were followed for at least six months. Most (98.5%) of the patients had OA. Seven out of 19 studies were funded by the prosthesis manufacturer; eight studies did not report their sources of funding.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results: at least six months after surgery</B>
</P>
<P>
<I>Knee pain (higher score means less pain)</I>
</P>
<P>&#8226; People in the fixed bearing group rated their pain as 0.09 points higher on the KSS scale of 0 to 50 than people in the mobile bearing group (absolute difference 2.4%).</P>
<P>&#8226; People in the mobile bearing group rated their pain at 41.4 points compared with 41.49 points in the fixed bearing group.</P>
<P>
<I>Clinical and functional scores (higher score means better function)</I>
</P>
<P>&#8226; People in the fixed bearing group rated their function as 0.10 points lower on the KSS scale of 0 to 100 than people in the mobile bearing group (absolute difference 0.1%).</P>
<P>&#8226; People in the mobile bearing group rated their function at 84.5 points compared with 84.4 points in the fixed bearing group.</P>
<P>
<I>Health-related quality of life (higher score means better quality of life)</I>
</P>
<P>&#8226; People in the fixed bearing group rated their physical quality of life as 1.96 points lower on the Short Form (SF)-12 scale of 0 to 100 than people in the mobile bearing group (absolute difference 1.96%).</P>
<P>&#8226; People in the mobile bearing group rated their physical quality of life to be 42.3 points compared with 40.34 points in the fixed bearing group.</P>
<P>
<I>Revision surgery</I>
</P>
<P>&#8226; 3 more knees per 1000 in the mobile bearing group needed further surgery than in the fixed bearing group. This may have happened by chance.</P>
<P>&#8226; 11 per 1000 knees in the fixed bearing group and 14 per 1000 knees in the mobile group needed further surgery to the knee (a revision).</P>
<P>
<I>Mortality</I>
</P>
<P>&#8226; 11 more people per 1000 in the mobile bearing group died than in the fixed bearing group. This may have happened by chance.</P>
<P>&#8226; 22 per 1000 people in the fixed bearing group and 33 per 1000 people in the mobile bearing group died.</P>
<P>
<I>Reoperation rate</I>
</P>
<P>&#8226; 12 per 1000 knees in both fixed bearing and mobile bearing groups needed a reoperation.</P>
<P>
<I>Other serious adverse events</I>
</P>
<P>&#8226; 1 more knee per 1000 in the fixed bearing group had another serious adverse event than in the mobile bearing group. This may have happened by chance.</P>
<P>&#8226; 7 per 1000 knees in the fixed bearing group and 6 per 1000 knees in the mobile bearing group had another serious adverse event.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
</P>
<P>Mobile bearing implants probably cause little or no difference in pain compared with fixed bearing implants (moderate quality).</P>
<P>Mobile bearing implants may cause little or no difference in function, health-related quality of life, revision surgery, mortality, reoperation rates and serious adverse events compared with fixed bearing implants (low quality).</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2015-01-28 12:27:02 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>It is unclear whether there are differences in benefits and harms between mobile and fixed prostheses for total knee arthroplasty (TKA). The previous Cochrane review published in 2004 included two articles. Many more trials have been performed since then; therefore an update is needed.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2015-01-18 21:22:04 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>To assess the benefits and harms of mobile bearing compared with fixed bearing cruciate retaining total knee arthroplasty for functional and clinical outcomes in patients with osteoarthritis (OA) or rheumatoid arthritis (RA).</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2015-01-28 12:27:28 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We searched <I>The Cochrane Library</I>, PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL and Web of Science up to 27 February 2014, and the trial registers ClinicalTrials.gov, Multiregister, Current Controlled Trials and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform for data from unpublished trials, up to 11 February 2014. We also screened the reference lists of selected articles.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2015-01-18 21:25:08 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We selected randomised controlled trials comparing mobile bearing with fixed bearing prostheses in cruciate retaining TKA among patients with osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis, using functional or clinical outcome measures and follow-up of at least six months.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2015-01-18 21:25:15 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We used standard methodological procedures as expected by The Cochrane Collaboration.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-01-28 12:29:30 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We found 19 studies with 1641 participants (1616 with OA (98.5%) and 25 with RA (1.5%)) and 2247 knees. Seventeen new studies were included in this update.</P>
<P>Quality of the evidence ranged from moderate (knee pain) to low (other outcomes). Most studies had unclear risk of bias for allocation concealment, blinding of participants and personnel, blinding of outcome assessment and selective reporting, and high risk of bias for incomplete outcome data and other bias.</P>
<P>
<I>Knee pain</I>
</P>
<P>We calculated the standardised mean difference (SMD) for pain, using the Knee Society Score (KSS) and visual analogue scale (VAS) in 11 studies (58%) and 1531 knees (68%). No statistically significant differences between groups were reported (SMD 0.09, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.03 to 0.22, P value 0.15). This represents an absolute risk difference of 2.4% points higher (95% CI 0.8% lower to 5.9% higher) on the KSS pain scale and a relative percent change of 0.22% (95% CI 0.07% lower to 0.53% higher). The results were homogeneous.</P>
<P>
<I>Clinical and functional scores </I>
</P>
<P>The KSS clinical score did not differ statistically significantly between groups (14 studies (74%) and 1845 knees (82%)) with a mean difference (MD) of -1.06 points (95% CI -2.87 to 0.74, P value 0.25) and heterogeneous results. KSS function was reported in 14 studies (74%) with 1845 knees (82%) as an MD of -0.10 point (95% CI -1.93 to 1.73, P value 0.91) and homogeneous results. In two studies (11%), the KSS total score was favourable for mobile bearing (159 vs 132 for fixed bearing), with MD of -26.52 points (95% CI -45.03 to -8.01, P value 0.005), but with a wide 95% confidence interval indicating uncertainty about the estimate.</P>
<P>Other reported scoring systems did not show statistically significant differences: Hospital for Special Surgery (HSS) score (seven studies (37%) in 1021 knees (45%)) with an MD of -1.36 (95% CI -4.18 to 1.46, P value 0.35); Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) total score (two studies (11%), 167 knees (7%)) with an MD of -4.46 (95% CI -16.26 to 7.34, P value 0.46); and Oxford total (five studies (26%), 647 knees (29%) with an MD of -0.25 (95% CI -1.41 to 0.91, P value 0.67).</P>
<P>
<I>Health-related quality of life</I>
</P>
<P>Three studies (16%) with 498 knees (22%) reported on health-related quality of life, and no statistically significant differences were noted between the mobile bearing and fixed bearing groups. The Short Form (SF)-12 Physical Component Summary had an MD of -1.96 (95% CI -4.55 to 0.63, P value 0.14) and heterogeneous results.</P>
<P>
<I>Revision surgery</I>
</P>
<P>Twenty seven revisions (1.3%) were performed in 17 studies (89%) with 2065 knees (92%). In all, 13 knees were revised in the fixed bearing group and 14 knees in the mobile bearing group. No statistically significant differences were found (risk difference 0.00, 95% CI -0.01 to 0.01, P value 0.58), and homogeneous results were reported.</P>
<P>
<I>Mortality</I>
</P>
<P>In seven out of 19 studies, 13 participants (37%) died. Two of these participants had undergone bilateral surgery, and for seven participants, it was unclear which prosthesis they had received; therefore they were excluded from the analyses. Thus our analysis included four out of 191 participants (2.1%) who had died: one in the fixed bearing group and three in the mobile bearing group. No statistically significant differences were found. The risk difference was -0.02 (95% CI -0.06 to 0.03, P value 0.49) and results were homogeneous.</P>
<P>
<I>Reoperation rates</I>
</P>
<P>Thirty reoperations were performed in 17 studies (89%) with 2065 knees (92%): 18 knees in the fixed bearing group (of the 1031 knees) and 12 knees in the mobile group (of the 1034 knees). No statistically significant differences were found. The risk difference was -0.01 (95% CI -0.01 to 0.01, P value 0.99) with homogeneous results.</P>
<P>
<I>Other serious adverse events</I>
</P>
<P>Sixteen studies (84%) reported nine other serious adverse events in 1735 knees (77%): four in the fixed bearing group (of the 862 knees) and five in the mobile bearing group (of the 873 knees). No statistically significant differences were found (risk difference 0.00, 95% CI -0.01 to 0.01, P value 0.88), and results were homogeneous.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2015-01-19 22:43:28 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Moderate- to low-quality evidence suggests that mobile bearing prostheses may have similar effects on knee pain, clinical and functional scores, health-related quality of life, revision surgery, mortality, reoperation rate and other serious adverse events compared with fixed bearing prostheses in posterior cruciate retaining TKA. Therefore we cannot draw firm conclusions. Most (98.5%) participants had OA, so the findings primarily reflect results reported in participants with OA. Future studies should report in greater detail outcomes such as those presented in this systematic review, with sufficient follow-up time to allow gathering of high-quality evidence and to inform clinical practice. Large registry-based studies may have added value, but they are subject to treatment-by-indication bias. Therefore, this systematic review of RCTs can be viewed as the best available evidence.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2015-01-18 21:46:35 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Osteoarthritis (OA) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) are conditions that can affect the knee joints. OA and RA lead to pain, loss of function and a lower quality of life. In some people, damage and pain in the knee from arthritis are so severe that joint replacement is required. Approximately 10% of men and 18% of women older than 60 years have OA (<LINK REF="REF-World-Health-Organization-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">World Health Organization 2013</LINK>). Because of the ageing society as well as increasing obesity, the prevalence of knee OA continues to increase (<LINK REF="REF-Pereira-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pereira 2011</LINK>). The prevalence of RA varies between 0.3% and 1% (<LINK REF="REF-World-Health-Organization-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">World Health Organization 2013</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2015-01-18 21:49:24 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is a very common and reliable orthopaedic procedure for end-stage arthritis of the knee. TKA has proved to be a successful surgical intervention that reduces pain and enhances physical function. It is a frequently performed procedure, and the number of TKAs is expected to increase exponentially in future years (<LINK REF="REF-Kurtz-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kurtz 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>Recent decennia have seen an expansion of technological developments in TKA, usually introduced into clinical practice without appropriate assessment (<LINK REF="REF-Gioe-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gioe 2011</LINK>). The mobile (meniscal or rotating) bearing TKA with a polyethylene insert has some freedom of movement and is an example of such a new development. The main goal of the mobile bearing insert is to decrease contact stresses at the implant interface (<LINK REF="REF-Matsuda-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Matsuda 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Szivek-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Szivek 1996</LINK>). Contradictory views exist as to whether the mobile bearing prosthesis will improve functionality as compared with the fixed bearing prosthesis for cruciate retaining TKA.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2015-01-18 21:50:21 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Previously, we performed a systematic review of the literature to assess whether mobile bearing total knee prostheses provide better functional outcomes in patients with OA and RA (<LINK REF="REF-Jacobs-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jacobs 2004</LINK>). This previous review included two randomised controlled trials. Performing a meta-analysis therefore was not possible. Since the time of that review, many trials have been performed to study the clinical and functional outcomes of mobile bearing TKA in comparison with fixed bearing TKA. Thus, an update of the previous review is warranted.</P>

<P>In co-operation with a trained medical librarian, we composed a new search strategy. We searched the following databases on 27 February 2014: <I>The Cochrane Library</I> (2014, Issue 1), PubMed (1944 to 27 February 2014), EMBASE (Ovid version) (1980 to 27 February 2014), Web of Science (1945 to 27 February 2014) and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) (EbscoHost-version) (1981 to 27 February 2014). In addition, we searched the following trial registries on 11 February 2014: ClinicalTrials.gov, Multi-register, Current Controlled Trials, the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and the Dutch trial registry.</P>
<P>The search strategy consisted of the AND combination of two main concepts: rheumatoid arthritis or osteoarthritis, and knee arthroplasty. For the different concepts, we used all relevant keyword variations, not only keyword variations in the controlled vocabularies of the various databases, but free-text word variations of these concepts as well. We optimised the search strategies for all consulted databases, taking into account differences in the various controlled vocabularies, as well as differences in database-specific technical variations (e.g. use of quotation marks). We composed three different versions of the search strategy.</P>

<STUDY_SELECTION MODIFIED="2015-01-18 22:09:24 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Four review authors (KN, BP, SH, PM) conducted the literature search in co-operation with a trained medical librarian and retrieved the references to be evaluated. Two review authors (KN, BP or SH, PM) independently selected trials for inclusion in the review. We resolved disagreements by consensus. When we could not reach consensus, we consulted a third review author (WJ) for the decisive vote.</P>
<P>We selected articles in two steps. In the first step, we excluded articles when it was apparent from either the title or the abstract that the study did not meet the criteria as mentioned in the <LINK TAG="SELECTION_CRITERIA" TYPE="SECTION">Criteria for considering studies for this review</LINK>. In the second step, we excluded articles when it was apparent from inspection of the printed article:</P>

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2015-01-18 22:13:07 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two out of five possible review authors (KN, BP, WJ, SH, PM) assessed the risk of bias in duplicate independently. We assessed risk of bias using the tool of The Cochrane Collaboration (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>), including the domains random sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding of participants and personnel, blinding of outcome assessment, incomplete outcome data, selective reporting and other sources of bias. In the domain 'other bias,' we checked for homogeneity of data and co-interventions. We scored each domain as low, high or unclear. Under 'other bias,' we assessed co-interventions and baseline imbalance such as group homogeneity and subgroup homogeneity, because heterogeneity is often encountered and accounts for lack of power in many orthopaedic surgery trials.</P>
<P>When two review authors could not reach consensus, we consulted a third review author until consensus was reached.</P>
</QUALITY_ASSESSMENT>
<EFFECT_MEASURES MODIFIED="2015-01-19 22:31:24 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Studies eligible for the review were RCTs comparing a cruciate retaining mobile (rotating or meniscal) TKA against a fixed TKA.</P>
<P>
<B>Dichotomous data</B>
</P>
<P>For dichotomous outcomes, we calculated Mantel Haenszel random-effects risk ratios (RRs). This RR refers to the risk of an event in the experimental group relative to the risk of an event in the control group. Therefore the RR can be calculated only when events are reported in the study groups. If the events were rare and empty cells were found in one of the groups in many studies, we calculated Mantel Haenszel random-effects risk differences (RDs). Risk difference is the difference between observed risk in the two groups. The RD can be calculated even when no events are reported in one of the study groups.</P>
<P>
<B>Continuous data</B>
</P>
<P>For continuous outcomes, we calculated a random-effects mean difference (MD) weighted by the inverse variance. The mean difference is a standard statistic that measures the absolute difference between mean values in two groups in a clinical trial while taking into account the precision by which this is estimated. It estimates the amount by which the experimental intervention on average changes the outcome compared with the control group. In addition, when the same outcome was reported on different scales, using differing units and methods of assessment (e.g. pain scales), we pooled the results by calculating a standardised mean difference (SMD). We corrected differences in the direction of the scale by subtracting mean values from the maximum value of the scale. To facilitate interpretation of the SMD, we transformed it back into a common scale, using data from the most representative study, with the largest weighting as mobile bearing group baseline and standard deviation.</P>

<UNIT_OF_ANALYSIS MODIFIED="2015-01-18 22:25:21 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>An issue for studies on TKA is the possibility to perform bilateral surgery in which one knee is randomly assigned to receive mobile bearing and the other knee to fixed bearing prostheses. As not all studies have this design, we will analyse knee pain, clinical and functional scores and health-related quality of life with and without including these studies performing bilateral knee surgery to assess whether this affects our results. For mortality, we excluded from the analysis participants who underwent bilateral surgery.</P>

We screened 73 articles after removal of duplicates on the basis of title and abstract. We assessed the full text of 53 articles for eligibility. We excluded 34 articles, mostly because a posterior stabilised design was used for one or both types of prostheses in the study.

<P>In general we found participant populations from different studies to be comparable, especially in studies with bilateral TKA (<LINK REF="STD-Kim-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Kim 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kim-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Kim 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kim-2009a" TYPE="STUDY">Kim 2009a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kim-2009b" TYPE="STUDY">Kim 2009b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kim-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Kim 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Price-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Price 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Watanabe-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Watanabe 2005</LINK>). Moreover, the groups are fairly homogeneous regarding etiology, with more than 90% of participants having OA. As we included only cruciate retaining TKA, the groups were homogeneous in this aspect.</P>
<P>However, selection criteria of included studies are sometimes absent, or they differ between studies, which might produce heterogeneous groups with regard to underlying disease (<LINK REF="STD-Hansson-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Hansson 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kim-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Kim 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kim-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Kim 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Munro-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Munro 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-M_x00f6_ckel-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Möckel 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Watanabe-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Watanabe 2005</LINK>).</P>

<P>
<I>Knee pain</I>
</P>
<P>We calculated the standardised mean difference (SMD) for pain, using the KSS pain and VAS scores for 11 studies (58%) and 1531 knees (68%). For studies that reported Oxford pain, HSS pain or WOMAC pain and also reported KSS pain, the KSS pain was used. The SMD was 0.09 (95% CI -0.03 to 0.22, P value 0.15). This represents an absolute risk difference of 2.4% points higher (95% CI 0.8% lower to 5.9% higher) on the KSS pain scale and a relative percent change of 0.22% (95% CI 0.07% lower to 0.53% higher) on the KSS pain scale, but these are not significant clinical or statistical differences.</P>
<P>All outcome measures for knee pain showed no statistically significant differences and wide confidence intervals, indicating considerable uncertainty in the estimates. Nine studies (47%) reported Knee Society pain score in 1392 (62%) knees. No significant differences were found; the mean difference was 0.41 (95% CI -0.06 to 0.88, P value 0.08) in favour of fixed bearing. The results are homogeneous (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%, P value 0.57). Three studies (16%) reported VAS pain in 300 knees (13%) with a mean difference of -0.13 points (95% CI -0.96 to 0.69, P value 0.75). The results are heterogeneous (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 77%, P = 0.01). Furthermore, Oxford pain was reported in two studies (11%) with 184 knees (8%) with a mean difference of -0.42 (95% -0.89 to 0.05, P value 0.08). Other pain outcomes are WOMAC pain and HSS pain, but these were not available for pooling. WOMAC pain was reported in only one study. HSS pain was reported in three studies, but two of these studies did not report ranges or SDs.</P>
<P>
<I>Clinical and functional scores</I>
</P>
<P>Given the differences in outcomes measured in different studies, calculating a single standardised mean difference was not appropriate.</P>
<P>The Knee Society score was reported in 14 studies (74%) (1845 knees (82%)). No significant differences between groups were found, and the mean difference in KSS clinical was -1.06 point (95% CI -2.87 to 0.74, P value 0.25). The mean difference in KSS function, as reported in 14 studies (1865 knees), was -0.10 points (95% CI -1.93 to 1.73, P value 0.91). KSS clinical showed heterogeneity (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 77%, P value &lt; 0.01) and, for KSS function, homogeneous results (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 45%, P value 0.04). Furthermore, we found uncertainty in the estimate of the KSS total score based on two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Grodzki-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Grodzki 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tibesku-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Tibesku 2011</LINK>) with 71 knees. The mean difference between groups is -26.52 points (95% CI -45.03 to -8.01, P value 0.005). These results are homogeneous (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%, P = 0.80).</P>
<P>Other reported scoring systems also showed uncertainty in their estimates, including HSS (seven studies (37%) in 1021 knees (45%)) with a mean difference of -1.36 (95% CI -4.18 to 1.46, P value 0.35) (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 86%, P value &lt; 0.01), WOMAC total score (two studies (11%) in 167 knees (7%)) with a mean difference of -4.46 (95% CI -16.26 to 7.34, P value 0.46) (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 87%, P value &lt; 0.01) and Oxford total (five studies (26%) in 647 knees (29%) with a mean difference of -0.25 (95% CI -1.41 to 0.91, P value 0.67) (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%, P = 0.79). No other validated scoring systems (KOOS, WOMAC function, WOMAC stiffness, Oxford function) were available for pooling because no studies or just one study reported these outcomes.</P>
<P>
<I>Health-related quality of life </I>
</P>
<P>Only the SF-12 (PCS and MCS) was reported in three studies (16%) (<LINK REF="STD-Bailey-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Bailey 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lizaur_x002d_Utrilla-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Lizaur-Utrilla 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Munro-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Munro 2010</LINK>) with 498 knees (22%). The mean difference in PCS was -1.96 (95% CI -4.55 to 0.63, P value 0.14). The mean difference in MCS was -1.26 points (95% CI -4.75 to 2.22, P = 0.48). Both results were heterogeneous (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 61%, P value 0.09; I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 80%, P value 0.007), respectively).</P>
<P>
<I>Revision surgery</I>
</P>
<P>Orthopaedic surgeons performed a total of 27 revisions in 17 studies (89%) with 2065 knees (92%) - 13 knees in the fixed bearing group (of the 1031 knees) and 14 knees in the mobile bearing group (of the 1034 knees). No significant differences between groups were found (RD 0.00, 95% CI -0.01 to 0.01, P value 0.58). Follow-up time of the studies ranged from 0.5 year to 10 to 12 years, and 13 studies reported a follow-up time less than three years. The groups were homogeneous (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%, P value 1.00). <LINK REF="STD-Higuchi-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Higuchi 2009</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Tibesku-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Tibesku 2011</LINK> did not report the number of revisions. Reasons for revision surgery were polyethylene bearing dislocation (mobile bearing), ligamentous instability between the femur and the tibia (fixed bearing), complete wear of the tibial bearing polyethylene (mobile bearing and fixed bearing), infection (mobile bearing and fixed bearing), severe osteolysis (fixed bearing), patella component added (fixed bearing), tibial aseptic loosening (fixed bearing) and dislocation of the meniscal component (mobile bearing).</P>
<P>
<I>Mortality</I>
</P>
<P>Seven studies (37%) reported mortality. A total of 13 participants died. However, two of those who died (in two studies - <LINK REF="STD-Price-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Price 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Watanabe-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Watanabe 2005</LINK>) had undergone bilateral surgery, so death could not be attributed to one particular group; they were thus excluded from the analysis. <LINK REF="STD-Hanush-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Hanush 2010</LINK> reported four deaths and <LINK REF="STD-Munro-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Munro 2010</LINK> reported three deaths, but it was unclear whether these participants received a fixed bearing or a mobile bearing prosthesis. Therefore, in our analyses we included one participant who died (of the 96 participants) in the fixed bearing group and three who died (of the 95 participants) in the mobile bearing group. No significant difference was found between groups in terms of RD (-0.02, 95% CI -0.06 to 0.03, P value 0.49). The groups were homogeneous (I² = 0%, P value 0.79). <LINK REF="STD-Kim-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Kim 2010</LINK> stated that no deaths were related to surgery but did not report the number of persons who died. These studies thus were not included for this outcome.</P>
<P>
<I>Reoperation rate</I>
</P>
<P>A total of 30 reoperations were performed in 17 studies (89%) with 2065 knees (92%) - 18 knees in the fixed bearing group (of the 1031 knees) and 12 knees in the mobile bearing group (of the 1034 knees). No significant difference was found between groups in terms of RD (-0.01, 95% CI -0.01 to 0.01, P value 0.99). The groups were homogeneous (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%, P = 0.81). <LINK REF="STD-Higuchi-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Higuchi 2009</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Tibesku-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Tibesku 2011</LINK> did not report the number of reoperations. Reasons for reoperation were patella resurfacing (mobile bearing and fixed bearing), femoral fracture (fixed bearing), infection (fixed bearing and mobile bearing), skin-edge necrosis (mobile bearing and fixed bearing) and soft tissue revision for hematoma (mobile bearing).</P>
<P>
<I>Other serious adverse events</I>
</P>
<P>In all, 16 studies (84%) reported nine other serious adverse events in 1735 knees (77%) - four in the fixed bearing group (of the 862 knees) and five in the mobile bearing group (of the 873 knees). No significant difference was found (mean RD 0.00, 95% CI -0.01 to 0.01, P value 0.88). The groups were homogeneous (I² = 0%, P = 1.00). Serious adverse events included deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism (three mobile bearing and two fixed bearing), deep peroneal nerve palsy (two mobile bearing and one fixed bearing) and periprosthetic infection (not described whether a revision or a reoperation was needed) (one fixed bearing). Revision surgeries, reoperations and mortality were excluded from this rate of other serious adverse events because they are reported individually.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Minor outcomes</HEADING>
<P>Five studies (26%) reported overall (not stratified by tibial or femoral) radiolucent lines in 978 knees (44%). A total of 90 events occurred in the fixed bearing group (of the 489 knees) and 75 events in the mobile bearing group (of the 489 knees). No significant difference was found between groups (RR 1.20, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.55, P value 0.16). The results were homogeneous (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%, P value 0.84). Six studies (32%) reported tibial radiolucent lines in 1258 knees (56%). No significant difference was found between groups (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.49 to 1.72, P value 0.79). The results were heterogeneous (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 68%, P value 0.008). Four studies (21%) reported femoral radiolucent lines in 1095 knees (49%). No significant difference was found between groups (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.46 to 1.85, P value 0.82). The results were homogeneous (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%, P value 0.49).</P>
<P>Furthermore, six studies (32%) reported femorotibial alignment in 1047 knees (47%). No difference was found between groups; the mean difference was -0.40 (95% CI -0.86 to 0.06, P value 0.08). The results were heterogeneous (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 60%, P value 0.03).</P>
<P>Nine studies (47%) in 838 knees (37%) reported flexion. A significant difference in flexion was found in favour of mobile bearing, but with uncertainty in the estimate. The mean difference was -1.84 ° (95% CI -3.48 to -0.20, P value 0.03). The results are homogeneous (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%, P value 0.75). No significant difference was found regarding extension (four studies (21%), 291 knees (13%), 0.07 ° (95% CI -0.54 to 0.68, P value 0.82)). No heterogeneity was observed (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%, P value 0.43). Range of motion was reported in 10 studies (53%) in 1361 knees (61%). No significant difference between groups was found; the mean difference was -0.67 ° (95% CI -3.26 to 1.90, P value 0.61). However, the results were heterogeneous (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 77%, P value &lt; 0.001) and the estimate is uncertain.</P>

We found similar results in outcomes if we excluded these studies from the analyses. The only exception was HSS, which became significant in favour of mobile bearing when these studies were excluded, with a mean difference of -3.68 (95% CI -7.18 to -0.17, P value 0.04) based on four studies. However, the results were heterogeneous (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 72%, P value 0.01), with uncertainty in the estimate, and the difference is not clinically relevant. As very few studies had a low or unclear risk of bias, sensitivity analyses by quality of evidence were not possible.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-01-19 22:35:32 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In our search, we found 19 randomised trials and three additional articles about already included studies. Seventeen of these studies were new compared with studies included in the previous review (<LINK REF="REF-Jacobs-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jacobs 2004</LINK>). In short, both types of prostheses do not show clinically important differences in benefits and harms. Although some studies found results in favour of the mobile bearing total knee arthroplasty (TKA), no clinically relevant differences were found between mobile bearing and fixed bearing posterior cruciate retaining total knee arthroplasty regarding knee pain, clinical and functional questionnaire scores and health-related quality of life.</P>
<P>Knee pain was measured in 11 studies, but no clinically relevant differences were found. For clinical and functional scores, meta-analyses showed statistically significant differences only for the Knee Society Score (KSS) total score. However, this finding was based on two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Grodzki-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Grodzki 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tibesku-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Tibesku 2011</LINK>) and includes a very large 95% confidence interval, indicating uncertainty in the estimate. Health-related quality of life was measured in only three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Bailey-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Bailey 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lizaur_x002d_Utrilla-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Lizaur-Utrilla 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Munro-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Munro 2010</LINK>), and no clinically relevant differences were found.</P>
<P>Furthermore, no significant differences between groups were seen in revision surgery, mortality, reoperation rates and other serious adverse event rates. Especially the numbers of serious adverse events and revision surgery procedures hardly differed. We could include only four of the 13 reported deaths in our analysis because of bilateral surgeries, and because some studies did not report which prosthesis participants received. Reoperations were reported in 18 of the 1031 knees in the fixed bearing group and in 12 of the 1034 knees in the mobile bearing group. The difference in number of reoperations was caused mainly by findings from the study of <LINK REF="STD-Kim-2009a" TYPE="STUDY">Kim 2009a</LINK>. These investigators had a high incidence of infection in the fixed bearing group, and the study was temporarily stopped by the Infection Control Committee at their hospital, but no specific factors leading to the high incidence of infection were found. Furthermore, most studies reported follow-up less than three years, so it is possible that there are differences in outcomes with longer follow-up, especially for these outcomes. Large registry-based studies with long-term follow-up may be of added value for further study potential differences in these outcomes. However, as these studies are subject to treatment-by-indication bias, findings must be interpreted cautiously.</P>
<P>The quality of the evidence, as assessed by the GRADE approach, ranged from moderate (knee pain) to low (other major outcomes) (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>).</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2015-01-19 22:35:58 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Results are frequently not split for different treatment modalities nor different patient categories. Although we can understand that the prime interest of some articles differs, we believe that reporting more detailed preoperative and postoperative data in orthopaedic surgery could greatly benefit interpretation of outcome results. Functional performance could be affected by patellar resurfacing. Resurfacing of the patella could increase the work line of the quadriceps tendon, thereby increasing muscle efficiency and thus walk ability capacity (e.g. staircase) of patients. Until the influence of such factors is known, it is paramount to have insight into the results per factor in each study, and thus to report data specifically for all subgroups. Otherwise it is impossible to draw conclusions about treatment efficacy within a particular study or to pool results from different studies.</P>
<P>Most of the included studies describe different types of prostheses for the comparison of mobile bearing versus fixed bearing TKA. It is therefore impossible to know whether observed results are due to use of a mobile bearing or fixed bearing TKA, or to differences in other design features or even preoperative patient characteristics. Accordingly, when such studies find a significant difference in outcomes between prostheses, this could be the result of these design differences rather than to use of a mobile bearing or fixed bearing TKA. Furthermore, it is currently unknown whether differences in outcome may change over time if either implant behaves differently with reference to survivorship. Applicability of the results of cohort-based clinical studies to the general population has long been a topic of controversy. Such data are available in national arthroplasty registers and can thereby contribute substantial added value to an informed discussion of arthroplasty outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-Labek-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Labek 2011</LINK>), especially for outcomes that appear at long-term follow-up such as mortality and revision.</P>
<P>The KSS total was 26.52 points higher in favour of mobile bearing, but as mentioned before, but this finding was based on only two studies with a wide 95% CI (-45.03 to -8.01), indicating uncertainty in the estimate. The probability of publication bias was high, as only two studies reported this outcome instead of the more commonly reported KSS functional and KSS clinical separately. It is possible that although the KSS functional and the KSS clinical separately showed no significant differences, a significant difference would have been shown if both scores were summed up.</P>
<P>Furthermore, most (98.5%) of the participants had osteoarthritis (OA), so the results primarily reflect results in individuals with OA.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2015-01-19 22:36:56 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The quality of the evidence as graded by the GRADE approach ranged from moderate to low. This assessment was based on risk of bias of individual studies, indirectness, inconsistency of results, imprecision of results and high probability of publication bias, and provides the rationale or justification for downgrading the quality of the evidence.</P>
<P>The quality of knee pain, measured by KSS pain as moderate, and thus further research are likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and may change the estimate. The quality of evidence of this outcome measure was downgraded because of the risk of bias of individual studies (see <LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK>). This risk of bias was also responsible for downgrading of the quality of evidence in all other major outcome parameters (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>).</P>
<P>We did not downgrade any of the outcomes because of indirectness of the evidence. Only randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing fixed versus mobile bearings were included in different settings. Clinical and functional scores (range of motion (ROM)) and health-related quality of life measures (measured as Short Form (SF)-12 Physical Components Summary (PCS)) were downgraded because of unexplained heterogeneity. This heterogeneity may affect interpretation of results.</P>
<P>The number of serious adverse events (SAEs) resulting in revision and mortality was less than 300; this was also downgraded because of imprecision of results. These outcomes are graded as low quality, which means that further research is very likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and is likely to change the estimate.</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2015-01-19 18:40:13 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review has several strengths and limitations. We composed a new search strategy in cooperation with a trained medical librarian, and, besides the search in databases, we also searched trial registries. We found two unpublished terminated trials (<LINK REF="REF-NCT00208286" TYPE="REFERENCE">NCT00208286</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NCT01150929" TYPE="REFERENCE">NCT01150929</LINK>) that may fulfil our inclusion criteria. However, no results were posted, and it was unclear whether these studies were cruciate retaining. It is thus possible that some selection bias could have occurred. In addition, we found one ongoing study (<A HREF="http://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT00740376">NCT00740376</A>) without (complete) results. Two review authors independently selected trials for inclusion in the review and resolved disagreements by consensus. When no consensus could be found, a third review author was consulted for the decisive vote. Two review authors independently assessed in duplicate risk of bias. This reduces the possibility of observer bias. A limitation of this meta-analysis is that many studies report outcomes of only one postoperative follow-up moment, which limits the possibility of pooling intermediate results and may cause heterogeneity between studies. This also limits the possibility of analysing differences in follow-up moments. Furthermore, in our selection, we found rotating bearing and meniscal bearing types of implants. Differences could be present because of the anterior movement possibility of the meniscal bearing type. In the <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK> table, we have described each implant, so care providers can judge whether the results are applicable to their practice.</P>

<P>We found nine other systematic reviews on mobile bearing versus fixed bearing total knee arthroplasty.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Apostolopoulos-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Apostolopoulos 2011</LINK> reviewed clinical and basic scientific studies that compared clinical results, biomechanical features and kinematic patterns of fixed bearing versus mobile bearing knee designs. They concluded that clinical studies have not proved the superiority of mobile bearing.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Bo-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bo 2013</LINK> included 12 studies in a meta-analysis. They included RCTs with bilateral mobile bearing and fixed bearing total knee replacements. We included six of these studies. The study did not include retainment of the posterior cruciate as one of the inclusion criteria. Investigators found no differences in clinical, functional, satisfaction, complication and radiological results.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Cheng-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cheng 2013</LINK> included nine articles in a meta-analysis; only two of these articles are included in our selection. Study authors selected RCTs comparing mobile bearing and fixed bearing, including posterior stabilised/PCL resection with a mean follow-up &gt; 5 years. Researchers reported no differences in radiological outcomes or general health results between groups.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-van-der-Voort-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">van der Voort 2013</LINK> selected 41 studies; we included 14 of these articles. They included RCTs comparing mobile bearing and fixed bearing, regardless of whether or not they were cruciate retaining. Meta-analyses showed no clinically relevant differences in terms of revision rates, clinical outcome scores or patient-reported outcome measures between mobile bearing and fixed bearing total knee replacements (TKRs).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Smith-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smith 2011</LINK> identified 13 articles, but only four of these are included in our selection. This study did not have retainment of the posterior cruciate as one of the inclusion criteria. This could explain the difference in included studies in comparison with our review. Study authors used a limited search strategy, which might explain the additional trials in our review. Regardless, this study could find no significant differences in clinical outcome scores.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Wen-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wen 2011</LINK> identified 15 articles, of which five are included in our selection. This can be explained by the inclusion of posterior stabilised/posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) resection designs in this review. This review could not find differences between the two designs in terms of clinical and radiological outcomes.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Post-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Post 2010</LINK> identified seven non-comparative long-term follow-up studies. They analysed not only functional outcomes, but also long-term survivorship with both designs. This review found no differences in clinical outcome scores.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Bracht-van-der-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bracht van der 2010</LINK> identified six articles, of which three are included in our selection. This can be explained by the inclusion of posterior stabilised/PCL resection designs and non-randomised studies in this review. Moreover, study authors searched in six major journals on orthopaedic surgery instead of searching medical databases. They found no superiority in the clinical outcome of mobile-bearing over fixed-bearing TKA.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Oh-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oh 2009</LINK> identified 10 articles, but only four of these are included in our selection. This can be explained by the inclusion of posterior stabilised/PCL resection designs and non-randomised studies in this review. Study authors used a limited search strategy, which might explain the additional trials in our review. Regardless, this review could find no differences in clinical outcome scores.</P>
<P>Although all of these reviews used different selection criteria to compare mobile bearing versus fixed bearing (e.g. uni/bilateral, posterior stabilised/cruciate retaining) and differed in outcome measures, their results are congruent with our findings. No clinically important differences were found regarding clinical, functional, complication and radiological outcomes.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2015-01-19 18:48:59 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Current evidence suggests similar patient outcomes for mobile bearing total knee arthroplasty and fixed bearing total knee arthroplasty, regarding knee pain, clinical and functional questionnaire scores, health-related quality of life, revision surgery, mortality, reoperation and other serious adverse events among patients. No statistically and clinically relevant differences were found for any of these outcomes. Also, given the moderate to low quality of the studies, we cannot draw firm conclusions for clinical practice.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2015-01-19 18:55:32 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Since the time of preparation of the previous version of this review, many new publications have reported randomised trials on this subject. To be able to compare and pool outcomes from different studies, the outcomes must be presented at comparable assessment moments. The present review clearly identifies the need for trials to present data at final follow-up, but also for intermediate follow-ups. In the included studies, we could find no evidence of significant or clinically relevant differences in favour of mobile bearing total knee arthroplasty in comparison with fixed bearing total knee arthroplasty. However, specific patient groups may benefit from a certain prosthesis, such as athletes. This is a potential area for further research. In addition, future studies should report in greater detail on the outcomes presented in this systematic review, with sufficient follow-up time to obtain high-quality evidence and inform clinical practice. Large registry-based studies may have added value, particularly for infrequent outcomes such as mortality, revision and serious adverse events. However, as these registry-based studies are subject to treatment-by-indication bias (which is not the case in RCTs), the present systematic review of RCTs can be viewed as the best available evidence.</P>
<P>A specific problem related to comparing different types of prostheses is that the differences are small, and consequently the effect on patient performance for a given parameter is hard to detect and can be detected only with large sample sizes. Even more, clinical differences are strongly associated with preoperative functional capacity (<LINK REF="REF-Nelissen-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nelissen 1992</LINK>). The effect of an outcome parameter is often important in itself but of limited influence on the rest of the patient's performance. For example, the extent of migration in a radiostereophotogrammetric analysis (RSA) study should always be accompanied by functional and clinical parameters. We welcome the development of guidelines, such as those published in the <I>Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Poss-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Poss 2002</LINK>). Because of these methodological problems, more rigorous statistical methods must be performed so the coherence of several aspects of the outcome can be evaluated.</P>
