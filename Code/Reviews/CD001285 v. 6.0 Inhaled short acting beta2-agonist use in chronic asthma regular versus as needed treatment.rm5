Please could authors add names of the new studies (and as links to the studies in the description of the included studies in the text). It should be possible for readers to gain a good feel of the changes in the review from this section alone.  Also the alterations to the structure of the review (eg inclusion of studies with Ipatropium rescue and which they are) this would help. Any changed results or conclusions should also be here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;References:  I have tidied these up but the ATS reference is incomplete. Why are the study IDs preceeded by a number? This is not our usual convention. Also they will not rank in order unless they are numbered with intial zeros (eg 001 etc).  If the studies are renamed without the number in front the links should update automatically.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Table of included studies: Great&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Metaview Labels: &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;1) Please switch off totals for single study outcomes (eg 1#12, 1#32 etc)  2) Group labels have gone awry for 1#48-52 (placebo)  3) Question of combining Regular versus Prn and Regular versus Placebo - I find this labelling confusing as it is actually a sub-group division into SABA for rescue and Ipatropium. I suggest changing the labels to Beta agonist rescue and Anticholinergic Rescue perhaps (and reflecting this in the text). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Synopsis: I HAVE CHANGED BETA2- TO BETA-2 THROUGHOUT THE TEXT. ALSO ALL DOUBLE SPACES HAVE BEEN CHANGED TO SINGLE SPACES.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abstract: &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Results:  &amp;quot;The regular treatment groups tended to require slightly less rescue medication,  0.80 puffs/24 hours  (95% CI 0.07,1.30) and 0.42 puffs/daytime  (95% CI 0.12,0.72).&amp;quot; These should be shown as negative results to match metaview and the CI does not fit the metaview results: weighted mean difference -0.80 puffs/24 hours (95% CI -1.46,-0.14).   &lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;They also experienced fewer days with asthma symptoms, by 6.7%  (95% CI 2.7,10.7) but there was no difference in the percentage of nights with asthma awakenings.&amp;quot; Again negative signs needed for the weighted mean difference.&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;Conclusions: &amp;quot;However, there is still no clear and categoric advantage in their  regular use and  there would be a financial penalty for what would mean, in general, greater use of medication.&amp;quot;  Would you like to reword this as it is sounds stilted as it stands (although I can see what you mean)?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods:&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;Please list the new studies included as links so they can be easily identified, please also list those with Ipatropium rescue. &lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I cannot work out how you calculated the SD for the new cross-over studies - could you explain how this was done. I have looked at the Hancox 1999 paper and I think the confidence interval reflects 35 measurements (daily for 5 weeks) in 47 patients???? This would give an SD about twice as large as the one you have entered.  Did you get data from the authors.  This is a problem because the effect and its CI in the paper is calculated using a method for multiple measurements and I suspect paired data so will look quite different from RevMan analysis as if it was a parallel trial.  This is clearly unsatisfactory......... (but inverse variance method in RevMan 4.2 will help as you mention).  What method was used to assess SD for the other new crossovers?&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I do not think it makes sense to include the single study with no placebo (Richter 2000), as this does not fit the study selection stated. I would argue for taking this out. I am afraid this will alter the numbers in the text of course.&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Finally I do not think it makes sense to use a Random model in Comp1 Outcome 9 as the p value is over 0.05 and the methods section says this is when random pooling will be used. Also in the two studies of diurnal variability with parallel design the use of a random model gives equal weights to a very small and very large trial so should either be fixed (as there are less than 5 trials you cannot realistically assess heterogeneity) or not pooled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I will check these in detail against Metaview when the issue of Random of fixed model and Richter have been resolved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Discussion&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next action&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Back to Toby to enter the dates as above and then to authors for their response to my comments above please.&lt;br&gt;PLEASE USE THIS AS THE WORKING VERSION OF THE REVIEW AS I HAVE MADE ALTERATIONS TO THE TEXT.&lt;br&gt;Returned to Toby 17/12/2002&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" NOTES_MODIFIED="2009-03-30 14:07:15 +0200" NOTES_MODIFIED_BY="Paolo Rosati" REVIEW_NO="REG-AST" REVMAN_SUB_VERSION="5.0.18" REVMAN_VERSION="5" SPLIT_FROM="" STAGE="R" STATUS="A" TYPE="INTERVENTION" VERSION_NO="6.0">

<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>During an asthma attack, the airways narrow causing wheezing, coughing and breathlessness. Inhaled short acting beta-2 agonists, such as salbutamol or terbutaline, are commonly used as bronchodilators to relieve these symptoms. They can be used regularly or only when needed and are often used without medical supervision, raising concerns about the possibility of excessive use. The review of trials found little difference between the two methods.</P>
</SUMMARY_BODY>
</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT MODIFIED="2008-07-30 16:10:18 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Inhaled short-acting beta-2 agonists are the major class of bronchodilators used for relief of symptoms in asthma. There has been concern that excessive uncontrolled use of beta-2 agonists might have contributed to rises in asthma mortality seen in some countries. International consensus guidelines now generally recommend using short-acting beta-2 agonists only for relief of symptoms on an as needed basis. </P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To assess the effects of using short-acting inhaled beta-2 agonists regularly or only on demand in asthmatic adults and children on indices of asthma control.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>Searches were carried out of the Cochrane Airways Group "Asthma and Wheez* RCT" register in 1997, 1999 and 2002. Pharmaceutical companies and researchers with an interest in the area were asked directly for details of any studies that they knew of.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomised controlled trials in which the short-acting beta-2 agonist was given regularly in the experimental group, together with an inhaled bronchodilator for relief of symptoms ('rescue use'). The control group consisted of matching placebo inhaled regularly, with an inhaled bronchodilator for 'rescue use'.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Data were extracted and quality assessments were made by both reviewers. Parallel group and cross-over trials were analysed separately. Where possible data were pooled using a fixed effects model.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2008-07-30 16:10:18 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>800 abstracts were identified for the first version and 60 papers were requested for full assessment. In this update 15 studies were added to the 34 trials which met the entry criteria for the first version in 2000. No clinically or statistically significant differences were found in airway calibre measurements. The regular treatment groups required less rescue medication, -0.80 puffs/24 hours (95% CI -0.07 to -1.30) and -0.42 puffs/daytime (95% CI -0.12 to -0.72), and had fewer days with asthma symptoms, -6.7% (95% CI -2.7 to -10.7). There was no significant difference in the odds ratio for the occurrence of at least one major asthma exacerbation either in parallel group or cross over studies.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>In general, these results support current guidelines, although it has given reassuring evidence against concerns over regular use of inhaled short-acting beta-2 agonists.</P>

</ABSTRACT>
<BODY MODIFIED="2008-07-30 16:40:33 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Inhaled short-acting beta-2 agonists are the major class of bronchodilators used for relief of symptoms in asthma. They are readily available both on prescription and, in some countries, over the counter from pharmacies. Non-prescription sales of salbutamol in Australia were estimated to have increased by 410% between 1980 and 1986 (<LINK REF="REF-Jenkins-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jenkins 1990</LINK>). Prescriptions dispensed for asthma medications in the US in 1985 exceeded 50 million and a 200% increase in the number of prescriptions was seen between 1972 and 1985 (<LINK REF="REF-Bosco-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bosco 1987</LINK>).</P>
<P>Inhaled beta-2 agonists are often used by asthmatics without regular medical supervision (<LINK REF="REF-Kuschner-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kuschner 1997</LINK>), and in Australia over the counter supply of salbutamol was associated with under-treatment of asthma (<LINK REF="REF-Gibson1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gibson1993</LINK>).</P>
<P>Asthma mortality rates have undergone increases, with defined peaks, in a number of countries over the past thirty years (<LINK REF="REF-Jackson-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jackson 1988</LINK>). New Zealand showed a sustained increase from 1977 to 1982, with rates three times those in the UK (<LINK REF="REF-Sears-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sears 1986</LINK>), and there was concern that excessive uncontrolled use of beta-2 agonists might have contributed directly or indirectly to this rise in asthma mortality (<LINK REF="REF-Sears_x002c_-Rea-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sears, Rea 1986</LINK>). A study by Campbell (<LINK REF="REF-Campbell-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Campbell 1976</LINK>) showed that in four Australian states there was a high correlation between the sales of adrenergic bronchodilator aerosols and the corresponding asthma mortality rates for the periods 1961-1963 and 1964-1966. Later in 1989 a case control study in New Zealand linked the use of inhaled fenoterol with increased risk of death from asthma (<LINK REF="REF-Crane-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Crane 1989</LINK>). This was followed soon after by a similar study in Saskatchewan which also showed an association between excessive use of beta-2 agonists and the risk of death or near death from asthma (<LINK REF="REF-Spitzer-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spitzer 1992</LINK>).</P>
<P>Increased understanding of the pathophysiological processes occurring in airways in asthmatics has lead to a search for increasingly specific anti-inflammatory agents to control airway inflammation. However, anti-inflammatory inhaled corticosteroids remain the core of preventive management. International consensus guidelines on the treatment of asthma have been formulated during the past decade and in many cases form the basis for national guidelines, which are widely disseminated to health professionals and asthma educators. They have emphasised the primary role for "preventer" medication, usually inhaled corticosteroids, with short-acting beta-2 agonists used as-needed for relief of residual intercurrent symptoms. Regular use of short acting beta-2 agonists have been proscribed in most of these guidelines because of the safety concerns alluded to.</P>
<P>However, the optimum use of short-acting beta-2 agonists in patients with frequent or predictable symptoms remains unclear. This controversy has flowed on into concern about the use of regular long-acting beta-2 agonists which are now available specifically for symptom control.</P>
<P>This review aims to synthesize the findings from all studies comparing regular with as-needed use of short-acting beta-2 agonists.</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>The broad objective of the review was to determine whether short-acting beta-2 agonists are best used regularly or only as-needed by asthmatic adults and children.</P>
<P>The specific purpose of the review was to assess whether using regular use of short-acting beta-2 agonists reduces asthma control and pulmonary function; worsens symptoms, airway reactivity and quality of life; and increases the rate of exacerbations.</P>

<SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2008-07-30 16:10:46 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<CRIT_STUDIES>
<P>We considered all randomised studies that were blinded, preferably double blind, but also single blind. Studies without a placebo arm were considered provided that effective blinding had been maintained. Studies could be either of parallel group or cross-over design.</P>
</CRIT_STUDIES>
<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>We included studies in which participants were adults or children with a clinical diagnosis of asthma present for at least six months, diagnosed according to accepted international criteria such as those published by the ATS. We looked specifically for documented reversibility to short-acting inhaled beta-2 agonists and an indication of the baseline asthma severity. The participants had stable asthma and acute exacerbation phase studies were not included. Other asthma therapies could be used during the study, and we assessed the level and stability of dose used.<BR/>Studies which included some or all participants with other pulmonary diseases, such as Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) were excluded unless the results for those with asthma alone were available separately. <BR/>Subgroup analysis by co-intervention was planned to investigate use in differing grades of asthma severity.</P>
</CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>Any short-acting inhaled beta-2 agonist could be used, at equivalent doses as far as possible. The short-acting beta-2 agonist was given regularly three times daily (tds) or four times daily (qds) in the experimental group. The control group consisted of matching placebo inhaled regularly at the same frequency as the experimental group. Both groups also used an inhaled short acting beta-2 agonist as needed for relief of symptoms (rescue use) thus giving a "regular " use and an "as needed" use group.<BR/>Studies in which both the experimental group and placebo control group used an anticholinergic agent for rescue use were also included in a sub-group.<BR/>Studies using inhaled short acting agents twice daily (bd) or oral administration of beta-2 agonists were excluded as were studies using inhaled long-acting beta-2 agonists, which are the subject of separate reviews.</P>

<P>Studies could use a variety of measures of asthma control and we specifically extracted<BR/>results for the following outcomes where available:<BR/>1. Home monitoring of airway calibre- morning and evening peak expiratory flows (am PEF, pm PEF), amplitude of PEF (the variability over the day).·<BR/>2. Clinic measurements of airway function- baseline (pre bronchodilator) forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), forced vital capacity (FVC), maximum mid expiratory flow (FEF25-75), maximum post bronchodilator FEV1.<BR/>3. Minimum post exercise FEV1, with and without pre-medication with beta-2 agonist<BR/>4. Asthma symptom scores for whole day, and separated into day time and night time periods.<BR/>5. Rescue bronchodilator use for symptom relief - whole day, day time, night time.<BR/>6. Quality of life scores (QOL)-overall summary, plus domains of symptoms, emotions, environmental exposure, exercise limitation.<BR/>7. Days and nights with and without asthma symptoms.<BR/>8. Asthma exacerbation rates.<BR/>9. Airway hyperreactivity measurements (BHR) to "direct" pharmacological challenge e.g. methacholine or histamine or"indirect" (i.e.. via mast cell degranulation) challenge with AMP (adenosine monophosphate).<BR/>10. Early and late asthmatic response- post allergen in atopic asthma.<BR/>11. Airway reactivity ( to methacholine and allergen) dose shift due to beta agonist premedication.<BR/>12. Airway reactivity dose shift following allergen exposure.<BR/>13. Adverse events</P>
<P>We decided that measures of airway inflammation, obtained by bronchoscopy or sputum analysis would not be included in the review at this stage, as there were not sufficient studies reporting them.</P>

<SEARCH_METHODS MODIFIED="2008-07-30 16:11:15 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>A search was carried out of the Cochrane Airways Group "Asthma and Wheez* RCT" register. This has been derived from a search of EMBASE, MEDLINE and CINAHL databases augmented by relevant RCTs identified by hand searching of the 20 most productive respiratory care journals. The database includes studies published in a language other than English. The initial search of the database was carried out using the terms</P>
<P>Asthma OR Wheez* and beta agonist OR bronchodilator OR salbutamol OR albuterol Or terbutaline OR isoproterenol OR reproterol OR fenoterol and this was narrowed with the inclusion of RCT OR controlled trial OR regular.</P>
<P>All pharmaceutical companies with major involvement in the respiratory area were approached directly with a request for details of any studies they had carried out or sponsored in the area of the review. Researchers known to have an active interest in the area were asked by letter for details of any unpublished studies they had carried out or any studies that they knew of. Abstracts submitted to major international respiratory society meetings were checked and followed up with requests to authors for subsequent publication details.</P>

<P>QUALITY ASSESSMENT<BR/>
</P>
<P>DATA EXTRACTION<BR/>
</P>
<P>STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS<BR/>
</P>
<P>Planned subgroup comparisons were:<BR/>Rescue agent- studies comparing regular inhaled short acting beta-2 agonist with placebo; the rescue agent used by both groups being either a short acting beta-2 agonist or ipratropium bromide.<BR/>Study design- parallel group and crossover.<BR/>Population- adults and children.<BR/>Co intervention- other asthma therapy - i.e. those on no inhaled corticosteroids (no ICS group); those all on inhaled corticosteroids (ICS group); a mixed group including those either on one of a variety of preventer medications (cromones, inhaled and oral corticosteroids) or on none (Mixed group).<BR/>Intervention delivery system- MDI, spacer devices, dry powder devices. This was planned in the protocol but on review of the literature, it was decided that under the conditions in the clinical trials included in the study, no difference was likely to exist in practice. The main differences which might occur due to poor coordination or low inspiratory airflow in the patients, were screened for, and inability to use the device adequately was an exclusion criterion for the studies.</P>
<P>In the first version of the review it was planned to examine differences in the length of treatment- short term ( &lt;=2 weeks), intermediate term (2-6 weeks) or long term (&gt; 6 weeks). However, it was found that only 5 studies used treatment periods less than 4 weeks and there were no differences between the results from those with shorter treatment periods. This subgroup analysis was not repeated in the second version.<BR/>The period after study treatment withdrawal (run out) was also examined because of fears that regular treatment might lead to adverse rebound effects on asthma control and airway reactivity.</P>
<P>The main objective of the review was to exclude harmful effects of "regular" treatment with beta agonists in asthma, so we were seeking either no difference between the "regular" and "as needed" treatment groups or possibly a small advantage in "as needed" treatment. The inclusion of studies comparing regular inhaled short acting beta-2 agonist with placebo use gives a much larger number of studies for inclusion and more robust conclusions, especially when seeking harmful effects of regular use.</P>
<P>Sensitivity analyses were planned using the domains:<BR/>1. Methodological quality- Cochrane Collaboration criteria A versus B&amp;C; Jadad scores 3-5 versus &lt;3<BR/>2. Random effects versus fixed effects modelling.</P>
<STUDY_SELECTION MODIFIED="2008-07-30 16:35:57 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>Two review authors assessed the search results and determined which studies would be retrieved in full for further scrutiny. Decisions to include or exclude studies were made by two authors. Reasons for exclusion were documented. </P>
</STUDY_SELECTION>
<DATA_EXTRACTION MODIFIED="2008-07-30 16:33:34 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>Data was extracted from the published results and tables independently by both reviewers, or from data requested by letter from the responsible author or sponsoring pharmaceutical company. The latter occurred on at least two occasions. Unfortunately, many authors were unable to access their original data. Data taken from interpretation of graphic display was sent to authors for confirmation. Data was entered by one reviewer (JW) and double checked on separate occasion by a second person (AB) or (EHW).</P>
</DATA_EXTRACTION>
<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2008-07-30 16:35:13 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>Inclusion of studies in the review was decided by agreement between the two reviewers (EHW and JW), applying the selection criteria. Each study was independently assessed and scored by each reviewer using the full text of papers.</P>
<P>The trials were scored using the Cochrane approach to assessment of allocation concealment:<BR/>Grade A: Adequate concealment.<BR/>Grade B: Unclear concealment.<BR/>Grade C: Obviously not adequate concealment.</P>
<P>Each study was also assessed for validity using the method of Jadad (<LINK REF="REF-Jadad-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jadad 1996</LINK>), on a 0-5 scale as follows:<BR/>1. Was the study described as randomised? (1=yes, 0=no)<BR/>2. Was the study described as double-blind?(1=yes, 0=no)<BR/>3. Was there a description of withdrawals and drop outs? (1=yes, 0=no)<BR/>4. Was the method of randomisation well described and appropriate? (1=yes, 0=no)<BR/>5. Was the method of double-blinding well described and appropriate? (1=yes, 0=no)<BR/>6. Deduct 1 point if methods of randomisation or blinding were inappropriate.</P>
<P>Differences were resolved by discussion between the two reviewers. Remaining disagreement would have been decided by editorial appeal if required.</P>

<UNIT_OF_ANALYSIS MODIFIED="2008-07-30 16:33:59 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>Parallel group trials and crossover trials were treated separately. If an adequate washout period had been included and no period effects found in the trial analysis, the crossover studies were combined and the results compared. Future updates of the review may enable improved analyses of these studies when statistical packages to allow for calculation of summary effects become available.</P>
</UNIT_OF_ANALYSIS>
<DATA_SYNTHESIS MODIFIED="2008-07-30 16:35:19 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>All outcome measures were analysed separately for each comparison wherever any data existed. Outcome data were entered into the Cochrane Collaboration software programme, Review Manager, by two reviewers and verified on a second occasion. All included trials were combined using Review Manager.</P>
<P>For continuous variables the results of individual studies were combined as fixed effects weighted mean difference (WMD), with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Standardised mean difference (SMD), with 95% confidence intervals (CI) was used if different scales of measurement had been used for an outcome, such as different measures of bronchial reactivity, exacerbations of asthma, the early asthmatic response or symptom scores. The SMD is a statistic which expresses the difference in means between treatment groups in units of the pooled standard deviation. For dichotomous outcomes, the Peto odds ratio with 95% confidence interval, was calculated, and compared with the Odds Ratio (OR) and Risk Difference.<BR/>For pooled effects, a Breslow-Day test of heterogeneity was carried out and a p value &lt;0.05 was considered significant, indicating significant differences between studies. In the assessment of heterogeneity, possible causes arising from study design were considered. For significant results with some heterogeneity, when pooling data from more than five studies, random effects measures were quoted. Caution was used in deciding whether the results could be meaningfully combined.</P>

<P>Jadad scores for the 44 studies selected for inclusion from the selected papers were as follows: Jadad score 5: nine studies; Jadad score 4: thirty two studies; Jadad score 3: two studies; Jadad score 2: one study. Cochrane Collaboration (CC) grades for the same studies were: grade A : nine studies; grade B: thirty five studies; no studies were graded C. The studies were scored on the information presented in the paper, except for one study (<LINK REF="STD-Larsen-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Larsen 1998</LINK>) which was published only in abstract form so had very few details. It was given a score after authors had been successfully approached for further details. We did not write to request missing details of randomisation and blinding from the authors of the other papers as the response rate is known to be very low and we wished to limit requests to those for data. The majority of studies were given a Jadad score of at least four and all had a Cochrane Collaboration grade of either A or B, so we believe that it is probable that the majority of studies for which details were not available would have used methods that gave adequate blinding and effective concealment of randomisation. </P>

The differences between regular and "as needed" treatment for morning PEF, evening PEF and diurnal variability of PEF (amplitude, calculated as PEF max - PEF min / mean PEF x 100) were all of very small magnitude and only that for PEF variability in one crossover study was statistically significant.<BR/>Parallel group studies: am PEF WMD -2.70 l/min (95%CI -10.41,5.02), pm PEF WMD 3.70 l/min (95%CI -4.65,12.05) , amplitude PEF WMD 2.45 % (95%CI -1.46,6.36)<BR/>Cross over studies: am PEF WMD 0.68 l/min (95%CI -13.89,12.54), pm PEF WMD 7.00 l/min (95%CI -6.06,20.07), amplitude PEF WMD 4.40 % (95%CI 3.14,5.66)</P>
<P>In nine parallel group studies with 1480 subjects and four cross over studies with 109 subjects there were small differences tending in favour of "as needed" compared to regular use in forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), forced vital capacity (FVC) and forced mid-expiratory flow (FEF25-75) all performed at clinic visits pre bronchodilator. None of the differences were statistically significant.<BR/>Parallel group studies: FEV1 WMD -80 ml (95%CI -150,10), FVC WMD -140 ml (95%CI -430,150), FEF25-75 WMD -0.23 l/sec (95%CI -0.40,0.07)<BR/>Cross over studies: FEV1 WMD -110 ml (95%CI -320,90), FVC WMD -160 ml (95%CI -500,230), FEF25-75 WMD -0.07 l/sec (-0.36,0.22)</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="6">Subgroup results by use of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS)</HEADING>
<P>Subgroup analyses showed similar small and non significant differences in morning and evening PEF for those using ICS, WMD 5.08 l/min (95%CI -17.54,27.71)and WMD -24.00 l/min (95%CI -77.50,29.50) respectively. For those not using ICS the differences favoured the "as needed" group, but were also of small magnitude and not statistically significant, morning PEF WMD -12.83 l/min (95%CI -39.53,13.87) and evening PEF WMD -5.78 l/min (95%CI -32.93,21.37).</P>
<P>The difference in FEV1 in three studies with 243 subjects using ICS favoured regular use, WMD 40 ml (95%CI -180,260) whereas in one study with 227 subjects not using ICS the difference favoured "as needed use" WMD -90 ml (95%CI -280,100), but these differences are non-significant.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="6">Asthma Symptom Scores</HEADING>
<P>There were small differences in symptom scores between the regular and "as needed" treatment groups when measured over a 24 hour period, day time only or night time.

<P>Significantly less additional short acting beta-2 agonist rescue bronchodilator was used in an average 24 hour period and in the day time by those in the regular treatment group compared to the "as needed" group. The difference was smaller for night time use and failed to achieve statistical significance.<BR/>Whole day rescue use: WMD -0.80 puffs (-1.46,-0.14) ( 5 parallel group studies, n=928)<BR/>WMD -0.68 puffs (95%CI -1.30,-0.07) ( 3 cross over studies, n= 45)<BR/>Day time rescue use: WMD -0.34 puffs(9%CI -0.51,-0.18) ( 4 parallel group studies, n=1675)<BR/>WMD -1.21 puffs (95%CI -1.45, -0.96) (2 cross over studies, n= 330),<BR/>Night time rescue use: WMD -0.12 puffs (95%CI -0.31,0.08) ( 4 parallel group studies, n=1657)<BR/>WMD -0.17 puffs (95%CI -0.25,0.09) ( 2 cross over studies, n= 330)</P>
<P>There was a significantly larger fall in short acting beta-2 agonist rescue bronchodilator in the regular treatment group, WMD 1.52 puffs/24hrs (95%CI -2.03,1.01) in 3 studies (n=397) using the fixed effects model.<BR/>In those studies which used ipratropium bromide as the rescue agent , data were available in 3 cross over studies. Less rescue agent was again used in a 24 hour period by the regular short acting beta-2 agonist group, but the difference failed to reach statistical significance, WMD 0.26 puffs (95%CI -0.62,0.10) (n= 123).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="6">Use of inhaled corticosteroids</HEADING>
<P>In 2 studies (n= 370) in which subjects did not use ICS, the difference in short acting beta-2 agonist rescue bronchodilator use over 24 hours was not statistically significant , WMD -1.09 puffs (95%CI -3.22,1.05).

<HEADING LEVEL="6">Quality Of Life Scores</HEADING>
<P>Quality of life results are substantially incomplete due to lack of detailed data in published papers and non response from authors in the most relevant studies. The data available show no significant difference between treatments. In the large Drazen 1996 parallel group study (n=117) using a validated quality of life questionnaire (Juniper) the difference in change of AQOL score between groups was tiny, WMD 0.01 units (95%CI-0.24, 0.26), but similar to the result in a smaller (n=17) crossover study by Apter 1996 using the same instrument, WMD 0.02 units (95%CI -0.43, 0.47). This study also reported the domains separately i.e.. symptoms, emotions, exposure to environmental stimuli, activity limitation . None of the differences was statistically significant, and none was of a magnitude considered to be of clinical importance.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="6">Exacerbations of asthma</HEADING>
<P>Quantitative data on exacerbations of asthma came from 10 parallel group studies and 5 cross over studies, all of at least 12 weeks duration, with the exception of Sears 1990 which was of 6 weeks duration of treatment. The data in 12 of these referred to comparable deteriorations in asthma control which we were able to define as an exacerbation. The common definition included worsening of asthma symptoms that required treatment with oral corticosteroids in addition to study drug and short acting inhaled beta-2 agonist , with or without nebulized beta-2 agonists, increased inhaled corticosteroids or theophyllines.<BR/>In the study by Taylor 1998, daily asthma scores were given, based on morning PEF, rescue bronchodilator use and symptoms. Asthma scores were used to define the frequency, severity and duration of exacerbations, rather than the need for oral corticosteroid use. A score of 2 for 2 days constituted a minor exacerbation. A score of 3 for 2 or more days constituted a major exacerbation and a score of 4 constituted as medical emergency (see Table of Included Studies). The figures for those having at least one major exacerbation and those requiring at least one course of oral corticosteroids were available. Use of either did not change the direction of the overall result for the outcome. Data on major exacerbations, chosen by the author as the better measure, were used.</P>
<P>In three studies, <LINK REF="STD-Ekstrom-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Ekstrom 1998</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Steffensen-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Steffensen 1995</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Richter-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Richter 2000</LINK>, less precise definitions were given. The first gave withdrawals due to asthma deterioration and the second quoted asthma exacerbations as an adverse event and the third quoted emergency room attendance for treatment as an exacerbation. The results were compared after omitting these studies from the analysis.</P>
<P>There were slightly fewer exacerbations in the regularly treated group in parallel group studies but the odds ratios for the occurrence of one or more exacerbations were not statistically significant.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="6">Airway reactivity (AR) effects</HEADING>
<P>Direct AR<BR/>Direct airway reactivity was assessed and compared as methacholine PD20, methacholine PC20, histamine PD20 or histamine PC20. Using the change in reactivity from baseline before treatment, there was a small, but significant, increase in reactivity ( fall in PD/PC 20) in the regular treatment group in 4 parallel group studies (n=149), WMD -0.47 doubling doses (95%CI -0.81,-0.13) comparing regular use with placebo and any rescue agent. When analysing 2 parallel group studies (n= 131) in which a short acting beta-2 agonist was used as rescue agent, the difference was not statistically significant, WMD -0.64 doubling doses (95%CI -1.63,0.35).<BR/>In 4 crossover studies (n= 118) comparing regular treatment with placebo there was no difference in change in direct airway reactivity, WMD 0.09 doubling doses (95%CI -0.18,0.35).</P>
<P>Indirect airway reactivity<BR/>Indirect AR was assessed using AMP (adenosine monophosphate), exercise and allergen challenge, which are thought to act by stimulating the release of mediators from mast cells, .<BR/>One cross over study (<LINK REF="STD-Wilding-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Wilding 1996</LINK>) on subjects taking ICS (n=13) found no effect from regular short acting beta-2 agonists compared to placebo on indirect airway reactivity to AMP, WMD 0.04 doubling doses (95%CI -0.42,0.50). Two cross over studies (Cockcroft 1995, <LINK REF="STD-Cockcroft-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Cockcroft 1993</LINK>) ( n=37) investigated the change in allergen induced airway reactivity while taking regular short acting beta-2 agonists compared to receiving placebo.

<HEADING LEVEL="6">Bronchoprotection and tachyphylaxis to bronchoprotection</HEADING>
<P>Single doses of inhaled short acting beta-2 agonists protect against a variety of bronchoconstricting stimuli, both direct and indirect, independently of bronchodilation. This is termed "functional antagonism". The magnitude of the protection was assessed in O'Connor 1992. A single dose of terbutaline reduced airway responsiveness to methacholine (direct) challenge by 2.7 doubling doses (95%CI 1.9,3.5) and to AMP (indirect) challenge by 3.8 doubling doses (95%CI 2.7,4.9). Cockcroft showed a single dose of salbutamol reduced airway responsiveness to allergen by 3.7 (SD 1.5) doubling doses (Cockcroft 1993) and to methacholine by 2.97 (SD 1.3) (<LINK REF="STD-Cockcroft-A-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Cockcroft A 1995</LINK>).</P>
<P>After regular treatment with inhaled short acting beta-2 agonist or placebo, the degree of bronchoprotection to allergen challenge in Cockcroft 1993 was reduced in the active treatment group to 2.5 (SD 0.93) doubling doses and to methacholine challenge to 2.5 (SD 0.56) doubling doses. In O'Connor 1992 the degree of bronchoprotection to direct challenge with methacholine in the active treatment group was 2.02 (SD 1.34) doubling doses and to indirect challenge with AMP 1.7 doubling doses (95%CI 1.1,2.4). In <LINK REF="STD-Cockcroft-A-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Cockcroft A 1995</LINK> the degree of bronchoprotection to methacholine challenge in the active treatment group was 1.97 (SD1.19) doubling doses in those not on ICS and 2.25 (SD 1.01) doubling doses in those on ICS.<BR/>These reductions in the acute bronchoprotective effects of short acting beta-2 agonists on direct airway challenge were significantly greater in those treated with regular inhaled short acting beta-2 agonists than placebo, WMD -0.75 doubling doses (95%CI -1.19,-0.30) in the 3 cross over studies with full data (n=50) and the reduction on indirect airway challenge by allergen was significantly greater in the active treatment group in one study (<LINK REF="STD-Cockcroft-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Cockcroft 1993</LINK> , n=11), a difference of -1.20 doubling doses (95%CI -2.24,-0.16) .</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="6">Tachyphylaxis to bronchodilatation</HEADING>
<P>Investigation of clinically significant tolerance to the bronchodilator effects of short acting inhaled beta-2 agonists was carried out in a number of studies. Area under the curve (AUC) defined as the area in litre-hours between the 12-hour serial FEV1 curve and a horizontal line corresponding to the treatment day 1 baseline value, reflects both the magnitude and duration of the bronchodilator response. In 2 parallel group studies with full results, there was not a consistent pattern of "tolerance". In <LINK REF="STD-Kemp-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Kemp 1998</LINK> there was a decrease in AUC after regular treatment with short acting beta-2 agonists and in <LINK REF="STD-Pearlman-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Pearlman 1992</LINK> there was an increase. The difference in AUC for FEV1 was 3.90 L-hours (95%CI 2.96,4.84) on the first day of treatment with a short acting beta-2 agonist or placebo and after 12 weeks of treatment 2.70 L-hours (95%CI 1.51,3.69) in these 2 parallel group studies (n= 443).</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2008-07-30 16:40:28 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>This is a large review involving 44 studies and a large number of different outcome measures. However the number of studies in which the results could be combined was limited by the different approaches of investigators and the fact that they often did not measure the same endpoints or did not then report all the outcomes.<BR/>
<BR/>Some outcomes would seem to be more clinically relevant than others. Among the latter were airway calibre (reflected in airflow measurements), amount of relief bronchodilator needed , level of symptoms and exacerbation rates.</P>
<P>No clinically or statistically significant differences were seen between groups treated regularly or on an "as needed" basis with inhaled short acting beta-2 agonists in morning or evening peak expiratory flows or PEF diurnal variability.</P>
<P>There was a consistent trend to larger FEV1 in the group treated on an "as needed" basis, but the magnitude of the difference, between 80 -110 ml, was not large. FVC and FEF25-75 showed similar results favouring " as needed" treatment but all of these differences were small in clinical terms and not statistically significant.</P>
<P>No consistent pattern of benefit in asthma symptom scores was found in parallel group and cross over studies. The differences were small and none reached statistical significance. There was a small difference in the percentage of days without asthma symptoms, with the regularly treated group having 7% fewer (95%CI 3-11) but no difference in the percentage of nights without asthma awakenings. The regular group also required significantly less rescue medication , with a difference of 0.5 puffs (95%CI 0.1,0.7) for day time use and 0.8 puffs (95%CI 0.1,1.5) for a 24 hour period. However, the regularly treated group used more short acting beta-2 agonist overall when considering the regular doses given throughout the treatment period, plus the relief medication used. There was no difference found in night time use of rescue agent , 0.1 puff (95%CI -0.1,0.3).</P>
<P>There was no significant difference in the odds ratio for a major asthma exacerbation when short acting beta-2 agonists were used regularly compared to on an "as needed" basis and this result was consistent when the definition of an exacerbation was precise and when the definition was less clear, OR 0.9 (95%CI 0.7,1.1).</P>
<P>Subgroup analyses for all these outcomes did not show any differential effect in those using inhaled corticosteroids or in those not using any co-interventions.</P>
<P>Overall, these results provide reassuring evidence that regular use of inhaled short acting beta-2 agonists is not associated with a clinically meaningful deleterious effect on the main indicators of asthma control, though no beneficial effect was demonstrated for their regular use beyond that achieved by their "as needed" use, apart from a small benefit in day time symptoms.</P>
<P>Potential adverse effects of regular use have been widely investigated and some potentially adverse pharmacological effects were found. There was a small increase in "direct" airway reactivity found, of the order of 0.5 doubling doses (95%CI 0.1, 0.8). There was some tachyphylaxis to the bronchoprotective effect of short acting beta-2 agonist on direct airway reactivity, indicated by a significantly greater decrease in protection in the regular treatment group, of about one doubling dose magnitude. However, there remained clinically significant protection even after chronic regular use of short acting agents. Bronchodilator responsiveness also appeared to show a small degree of tachyphylaxis with regular use, though the significance of this small change is not clear. In atopic asthma, there was a larger late asthmatic reaction in FEV1 after regular treatment with short acting beta-2 agonists. The regular group also showed a higher incidence of tremor but the risk for other pharmacologically predictable effects was not greater.</P>
<P>There has been interest in the effects on airway indices after stopping regular treatment with short acting beta agonists, which would be relevant if some fundamental change to airway physiology or stability had occurred. This review failed to show any significant changes or worsening of airway function after stopping regular treatment.</P>
<P>The background to concerns about clinical control of patients with asthma taking short acting beta agonists regularly can be traced back to the study of Sears in 1990, which concluded that regular inhalation of a beta-sympathomimetic drug for six months is associated with poorer overall control in the majority of subjects with chronic asthma. Coming at a time when there was natural concern about peaks in asthma mortality, fears were raised that regular use of short acting beta agonists was a contributory factor. A problem with that study as published was that it was difficult to quantify the scale of deterioration in the regular treatment group compared to the "as needed group", and the priority given to various clinical and physiological endpoints was rather arbitrary.</P>
<P>The results of this current meta-analysis do not confirm the conclusions of the Sears study (<LINK REF="STD-Sears-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Sears 1990</LINK>), with most differences between regular short-acting beta-2 agonist treatment compared to "as needed" use being small and likely to have little, if any, clinical impact. However, no clinically significant beneficial effects have been demonstrated and thus in general there is no justification for advocating regular long term use of inhaled short acting beta-2 agonists.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2008-07-30 16:40:33 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>Respiratory guidelines ( BTS, GINA etc) have limited short-acting beta-2 agonists to as needed use, presumably because of the safety concerns referred to above. This review would in general confirm the rationale of these guidelines, although it has put these concerns into quantitative perspective. There no clear and categorical advantage in using short-acting beta-2 agonists regularly. In addition there would be a financial penalty related to the greater use of medication on a regular bronchodilator regime.</P>
<P>However, the lack of significant clinical detriment to using beta-2 agonists regularly means that more consideration should be given to patient preferences and circumstances, without dogmatic proscription on this matter. Management guidelines should reflect this reality.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Given the large number of studies which have compared regular versus as needed use of short-acting beta-2 agonist, with little obvious difference between treatment regimes, and with the new generation of long-acting beta-2 agonists already introduced, there would seem little point in further clinical research on this specific topic. </P>

Original groups not retained, some chose not to crossover; selective withdrawal of patients with declining FEV1 or exacerbations of asthma who were started on inhaled corticosteroids. Patients in this study continued their previous treatment in effectively 2 parallel groups.; continuous treatment or on demand according to symptoms, and rescue anticholinergic agent. No formal randomisation, no blinding, small numbers, confounding by high withdrawal rates.</P>
