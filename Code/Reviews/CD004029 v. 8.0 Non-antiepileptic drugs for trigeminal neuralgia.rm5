<P>
<B>Review question</B>
</P>
<P>The purpose of this review was to assess the effects of non-antiepileptic drugs in trigeminal neuralgia.</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>Trigeminal neuralgia is a condition that affects the trigeminal nerve, the nerve which provides sensation in the skin of the face. The condition causes a sudden, severe, stabbing facial pain near the nose, lips, cheek, eye or ear. The incidence of trigeminal neuralgia is three to five new cases per 100,000 people each year. Standard treatment is with drugs that are used to treat epilepsy (antiepileptic drugs) but non-antiepileptic drugs, such as baclofen and tocainide, have been used to treat trigeminal neuralgia since the 1970s.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>After a wide search for studies, we identified four trials involving 139 participants in total that met our criteria for inclusion in the review. Three randomised controlled trials compared the three different non-antiepileptic drugs tizanidine, tocainide and pimozide with carbamazepine, which is the standard drug treatment. No new trials were identified for the update of this review in 2013.</P>
<P>
<B>Results and quality of the evidence</B>
</P>
<P>Tizanidine did not produce significantly more benefit than carbamazepine according to low-quality evidence. The reporting of the tocainide trial did not allow us to assess whether the drug helped the pain of trigeminal neuralgia, but studies that were not part of this review suggest that this treatment can have serious harmful effects on the blood. Side effects of pimozide were very common but there was low-quality evidence that it was more effective than carbamazepine. In a fourth trial there was low-quality evidence that proparacaine hydrochloride eye drops did not show any significant benefit.</P>
<P>There is insufficient evidence from randomised controlled trials to show significant benefit from non-antiepileptic drugs in trigeminal neuralgia. Further well-designed randomised controlled trials are needed to establish whether non-antiepileptic drugs are beneficial in trigeminal neuralgia.</P>
<P>The searches for the review are up to date to May 2013. </P>

<P>Trigeminal neuralgia was defined by the International Association for the Study of Pain as a sudden, usually unilateral, severe, brief, stabbing recurrent pain in the distribution of one or more branches of the fifth cranial nerve. Standard treatment is with anti-epileptic drugs. Non-antiepileptic drugs have been used in the management of trigeminal neuralgia since the 1970s. This is an update of a review first published in 2006 and previously updated in 2011.</P>

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2013-11-22 16:38:17 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>On 20 May 2013, for this updated review, we searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group Specialized Register, CENTRAL (2013, Issue 4), MEDLINE (January 1966 to May 2013), EMBASE (January 1980 to May 2013), LILACS (January 1982 to May 2013) and the Chinese Biomedical Retrieval System (1978 to May 2013). We searched clinical trials registries for ongoing trials.</P>

<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2013-11-22 16:38:18 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included double-blind, randomised controlled trials in which the active drug was used either alone or in combination with other non-antiepileptic drugs for at least two weeks.</P>

</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-11-22 16:38:47 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Ruth Brassington">
<P>In this 2013 update, we updated the searches, but identified only two new ongoing studies. The review includes four trials involving 139 participants. The primary outcome measure in each was pain relief. Three trials compared one of the oral non-antiepileptic drugs tizanidine, tocainide or pimozide with carbamazepine. The quality of evidence for all outcomes for which data were available was low. In a trial of tizanidine involving 12 participants (one dropped out due to unrelated disease), one of five participants treated with tizanidine and four of six treated with carbamazepine improved (risk ratio (RR) 0.30, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.05 to 1.89). Few side effects were noted with tizanidine. For pimozide, there was evidence of greater efficacy than carbamazepine at six weeks. Up to 83% of participants reported adverse effects but these did not lead to withdrawal; the report did not provide comparable data for carbamazepine. Limited data meant that we could not assess the effects of tocainide; however, data from non-randomised studies (not included in this review) indicate that serious haematological adverse events can occur. A trial involving 47 participants compared 0.5% proparacaine hydrochloride eyedrops with placebo but did not show any significant benefits, again according to low-quality evidence. The report did not mention adverse events. The proparacaine trial was at low risk of bias; the other trials were at unclear risk of bias overall.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2013-11-22 16:38:52 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is low-quality evidence that the effect of tizanidine is not significantly different than that of carbamazepine in treating trigeminal neuralgia. Pimozide is more effective than carbamazepine, although the evidence is of low quality and the data did not allow comparison of adverse event rates. There is also low-quality evidence that 0.5% proparacaine hydrochloride eye drops have no benefit over placebo. Limitations in the data for tocainide prevent any conclusions being drawn. There is insufficient evidence from randomised controlled trials to show significant benefit from non-antiepileptic drugs in trigeminal neuralgia. More research is needed.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2013-11-22 16:39:55 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Trigeminal neuralgia was defined by the International Association for the Study of Pain as a sudden, usually unilateral, severe, brief, stabbing recurrent pain in the distribution of one or more branches of the fifth cranial nerve (<LINK REF="REF-Merskey-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Merskey 1994</LINK>). The International Headache Society (<LINK REF="REF-Anonymous-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anonymous 2004</LINK>) set the following criteria for trigeminal neuralgia.</P>
<P>A. Paroxysmal attacks of pain lasting from a fraction of a second to two minutes, affecting one or more divisions of the trigeminal nerve and fulfilling criteria B and C.<BR/>B. Pain that has at least one of the following characteristics:</P>
<OL>
<LI>intense, sharp, superficial or stabbing;</LI>
<LI>precipitated from trigger areas or by trigger factors.</LI>
</OL>
<P>C. Attacks are stereotyped in the individual patient.<BR/>D. There is no clinically evident neurological deficit.<BR/>E. Not attributed to another disorder.<BR/>
<BR/>The diagnosis of trigeminal neuralgia is based on clinical findings and there have not been any case controlled studies to validate diagnostic methods. A careful clinical history and examination can distinguish between trigeminal neuralgia and other disorders that cause facial pain (<LINK REF="REF-Zakrzewska-2002a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zakrzewska 2002a</LINK>).</P>
<P>Trigeminal neuralgia has an annual incidence of three to five per 100,000 people. It is more common in women than men (age-adjusted ratio: 1.74:1) and is most widespread in people aged 50 to 69 years. Attacks are commonly on the right side (<LINK REF="REF-Katusic-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Katusic 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Yoshimasu-1972" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yoshimasu 1972</LINK>). More recent data from primary care practices suggest that the incidence may be around 12.7 per 100,000 (<LINK REF="REF-Koopman-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Koopman 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>The aetiology is not clear. Compression of the trigeminal nerve root, at or near the dorsal root entry zone, by a blood vessel is a major causative or contributing factor (<LINK REF="REF-Devor-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Devor 2002</LINK>). Compression is not always found and it is then necessary to look for other causes. In a few cases trigeminal neuralgia is due to multiple sclerosis. Other rare causes include infiltration of the nerve root, trigeminal ganglion or nerve by a tumour or amyloid, and small infarcts or angiomas in the pons or medulla (<LINK REF="REF-Cheng-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cheng 1993</LINK>). Once all of these possibilities have been excluded, there remain a small proportion of patients in whom the aetiology is undetermined (<LINK REF="REF-Nurmikko-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nurmikko 2001</LINK>). Obermann has shown that atypical type trigeminal neuralgia may be the result of central changes (<LINK REF="REF-Obermann-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Obermann 2007</LINK>). The pain of idiopathic trigeminal neuralgia is indistinguishable from that caused by a demonstrable structural lesion other than vascular compression.</P>
<P>Spontaneous remission of trigeminal neuralgia is common but the disorder is often progressive. Remission may last for months or even years but as the attacks become more frequent, the patient may develop persistent pain between episodes. Attacks may come in clusters and can completely disrupt activities of daily living if left untreated (<LINK REF="REF-Katusic-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Katusic 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zakrzewska-2002b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zakrzewska 2002b</LINK>).</P>
<P>Antiepileptic drugs have been used in pain management since the 1960s. The clinical impression is that they are useful for neuropathic pain, especially when the pain is lancinating or burning (<LINK REF="REF-Jacox-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jacox 1994</LINK>). Based on two placebo-controlled studies of carbamazepine in trigeminal neuralgia, a Cochrane systematic review deduced a number needed to treat to benefit of 1.9 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.4 to 2.8) (<LINK REF="REF-Wiffen-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wiffen 2011</LINK>). In one randomised controlled trial (RCT), lamotrigine was effective as an add-on therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Zakrzewska-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zakrzewska 1997</LINK>). Little evidence supports a beneficial role of other antiepileptic drugs such as clonazepam, phenytoin and sodium valproate (<LINK REF="REF-Sindrup-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sindrup 2002</LINK>). Gabapentin has been evaluated in a small RCT (<LINK REF="REF-Lemos-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lemos 2008</LINK>) and pregabalin in a cohort study (<LINK REF="REF-Obermann-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Obermann 2008</LINK>). The long-term effects of carbamazepine have been evaluated in only one study, which showed either loss of effect or poor tolerability in half the participants after 10 years (<LINK REF="REF-Taylor-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Taylor 1981</LINK>). In a long-term cohort study of oxcarbazepine, pain increased with progression of disease severity and the drug became less effective in long-term pain control (<LINK REF="REF-Zakrzewska-2002b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zakrzewska 2002b</LINK>).</P>
<P>Non-antiepileptic drugs have been used to treat trigeminal neuralgia since the 1970s. Conventional analgesics such as aspirin, codeine and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are not used since experience suggests that they are not helpful. There has been a reported RCT on the use of dextromethorphan, an antitussive (cough suppressant) drug with analgesic effects, in patients with mixed facial neuralgias (<LINK REF="STD-Gilron-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Gilron 2000</LINK>). Other drugs that are used include baclofen, pimozide, racemic ketamine, proparacaine, tocainide, misoprostol and capsaicin. Baclofen is a gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor agonist that has the least serious adverse effects (<LINK REF="REF-Steardo-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Steardo 1984</LINK>). Pimozide is a neuroleptic that has shown significant relief of pain when compared with carbamazepine in a double-blind, cross-over trial. Racemic ketamine is an anaesthetic which showed some benefit when treating acute pain but was ineffective for pain lasting more than five years (<LINK REF="REF-Mathisen-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mathisen 1995</LINK>). Topical ophthalmic anaesthetics, such as proparacaine, have been reported to relieve trigeminal neuralgia pain in some patients but not in a randomised trial (<LINK REF="STD-Kondziolka-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Kondziolka 1994</LINK>). Tocainide is a drug used to prevent cardiac arrhythmias. It has been withdrawn from the market because of bone marrow suppression (<LINK REF="REF-Rawson-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rawson 1998</LINK>) but was tried in trigeminal neuralgia. Misoprostol is a long-acting prostaglandin E1 analogue which, in an open-label study, relieved trigeminal neuralgia in six of seven participants with definite multiple sclerosis who had failed to respond to conventional pharmacologic therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Reder-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reder 1995</LINK>). Use of capsaicin, the pungent component of red pepper, has been reported in two case studies (<LINK REF="REF-Fusco-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fusco 1992</LINK>). There have been previous systematic reviews of all drugs for trigeminal neuralgia (<LINK REF="REF-Sindrup-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sindrup 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zakrzewska-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zakrzewska 2009</LINK>). The review in Clinical Evidence (<LINK REF="REF-Zakrzewska-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zakrzewska 2009</LINK>) is updated every 18 months. International guidelines which used systematic review methodology have also been published (<LINK REF="REF-Cruccu-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cruccu 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gronseth-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gronseth 2008</LINK>). The aim of this review is to systematically review all double-blind RCTs of non-antiepileptic drugs for trigeminal neuralgia. Antiepileptic drugs for trigeminal neuralgia have been included in other Cochrane reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wiffen-2010a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wiffen 2010a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wiffen-2010b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wiffen 2010b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wiffen-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wiffen 2011</LINK>).</P>

<P>Only one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Kondziolka-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Kondziolka 1994</LINK>) claimed that the treatment groups were the same with regard to gender, age, duration of disease and pain scores. The others did not compare the baseline characteristics of the groups in detail. Many of the trials lacked clear diagnostic criteria and referred to typical trigeminal neuralgia but did not define it and they did not report whether participants had idiopathic trigeminal neuralgia. One cross-over trial (<LINK REF="STD-Lindstr_x00f6_m-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Lindström 1987</LINK>) did not report a washout period, so there is a high risk of a carry-over effect in this study. <LINK REF="STD-Vilming-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Vilming 1986</LINK> did not report whether there was a washout period prior to the start of the trial.</P>

<P>As the non-antiepileptic and control group interventions tested in the included studies were different, we did not combine the results. Instead, we describe the results of each trial as reported by the authors.</P>

<P>This comparison was reported in <LINK REF="STD-Vilming-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Vilming 1986</LINK>, a very small parallel-group trial (12 participants, with six in each group).</P>
<P>The duration of treatment was 21 days. Three participants taking tizanidine discontinued taking the optimal dose, one because of unrelated disease and two as a result of intolerable pain. The report provides results for 11 participants.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Primary outcome: immediate improvement in pain relief</HEADING>
<P>A visual analogue scale (VAS) was used to evaluate pain but the report does not include the results. The investigators reported overall efficacy assessed by participants and investigators on a four-point scale (no efficacy, slight, moderate, good or very good) but provide no other details of the measure. At the end of treatment, one of five participants improved with tizanidine and four of six with carbamazepine (RR 0.30, 95% CI 0.05 to 1.89) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>). The difference was not statistically significant.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Secondary outcomes</HEADING>
<P>The duration of treatment was 21 days, which was too short for the measurement of our secondary efficacy outcomes at 12 weeks.</P>

<P>One double-blind, cross-over RCT (<LINK REF="STD-Lindstr_x00f6_m-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Lindström 1987</LINK>) in 12 participants compared tocainide with carbamazepine.</P>
<P>The duration of each phase was two weeks. However, the authors did not report the washout period or data from the end of the first arm in this trial. Since there is a high risk of carry-over effects, we have not reported the quantitative data from this trial.</P>
<P>For adverse effects, the authors reported that tocainide produced nausea, distal paraesthesias and skin rash which led to withdrawal from the study, but non-randomised studies showed an unacceptable rate of serious haematological side effects and deaths (see <LINK TAG="DISCUSSION" TYPE="SECTION">Discussion</LINK>). The Lindstrom study did not report whether the adverse effects of tocainide were dose-dependent.</P>

<P>In a parallel-group RCT (<LINK REF="STD-Kondziolka-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Kondziolka 1994</LINK>), investigators assigned 47 participants to receive a single dose of proparacaine hydrochloride 0.5% or placebo eye drops. Each participant was treated only once.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Primary outcome: immediate improvement in pain relief</HEADING>
<P>A verbal pain rating scale (VRS) was used to assess the effect. There was no significant reduction of pain after 3, 10 or 30 days. At 30 days, six of 25 participants improved (i.e. had a 2 or more level decrease in pain on 10-point scale, or pain was gone or rare) with proparacaine hydrochloride 0.5%, and five of 22 improved with placebo (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.37 to 2.99) (<LINK REF="CMP-002.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.1</LINK>).

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Pimozide versus carbamazepine</HEADING>
<P>One double-blind, cross-over RCT (<LINK REF="STD-Lechin-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Lechin 1989</LINK>) compared pimozide and carbamazepine in 68 people but nine were not admitted to the treatment phase. Eleven participants did not contribute data to the statistical analysis: 10 because of protocol deviations and one dropped out. The trial lasted 24 weeks: four weeks of placebo washout, eight weeks of treatment following random assignment to carbamazepine or pimozide, four weeks of abrupt withdrawal with placebo substitution and eight weeks of cross-over treatment.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Primary outcome: immediate improvement in pain relief</HEADING>
<P>A trigeminal neuralgia score ranging from 0 to 100 was used to assess the effect. However, the authors did not state how they defined 'improvement', other than stating that all of the 48 participants on pimozide and 27 out of 48 participants on carbamazepine "showed improvement". They do give a percentage improvement score for each group after six weeks' treatment (when the authors state that there was "maximal improvement"); they also report that "similar differences were obtained" at weeks seven and eight, week eight being the end of the first treatment period. Week seven and eight results are provided in graph form in the study report as are second period results. In the first period, the reduction in total trigeminal neuralgia score was 78.4% with pimozide and 49.7% with carbamazepine, six weeks after starting treatment (MD 28.70%, 95% CI 20.88% to 36.52%) (see <LINK REF="CMP-003.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.1</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Secondary outcomes</HEADING>
<P>The study duration was too short (eight-week treatment phases) to report secondary efficacy outcomes at 12 weeks.</P>
<P>Adverse effects were recorded in 40 (83.3%) participants with pimozide. These were physical and mental retardation, hand tremors, memory impairment, involuntary movements during sleep and slight Parkinson's disease manifestations. In the carbamazepine period, 22 serious adverse effects occurred (one abnormal full blood count, one abnormal liver function, 18 lethargy, one inappropriate secretion of vasopressin and one erythematous exanthem that disappeared after the trial. However, the report does not provide the total number of participants with adverse effects in each group. Since some participants might have had more than one adverse effect with carbamazepine, we could not calculate the incidence of adverse effects between the two drugs. For pimozide, the adverse effects could be attenuated by reducing the dose, so may be dose-dependent.</P>
<P>No studies were alike, therefore we did not perform a meta-analysis.<BR/>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2013-11-22 16:48:55 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Ruth Brassington">
<P>We did not identify any new randomised controlled trials (RCTs) for this update. In a previous update, we re-evaluated the nine trials in the original review in the light of changed inclusion criteria. Since most drugs used in trigeminal neuralgia need to be escalated slowly in dose, and a steady state reached at the maximum dose, we considered it important that a trial should report the results from at least two weeks at the maximum steady state dose. Trigeminal neuralgia is a chronic condition and drugs need to provide pain relief for long periods. Our inclusion criteria therefore stated that the trial had last at least two weeks using the maximum steady dose. After reassessment of the trials, four clinical trials investigating non-antiepileptic drugs in the treatment of trigeminal neuralgia, with a total of 139 participants, met the inclusion criteria. The drugs tested were tizanidine, tocainide, proparacaine hydrochloride (0.5% eye drops) and pimozide. We were unable to pool the results because of heterogeneity between the studies. The results of these trials can be summarised as follows.</P>
<OL>
<LI>There was no significant difference in effect between carbamazepine and tizanidine measured using the selected outcomes. Larger and better studies are required to draw any conclusions (<LINK REF="STD-Vilming-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Vilming 1986</LINK>) (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>).</LI>
<LI>The efficacy of tocainide was not analysed because of the high risk of a carry-over effect and no separate first phase data were presented that would have enabled us to analyse these separately (<LINK REF="SOF-02" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 2</LINK>). In non-randomised studies, tocainide produced serious haematological side effects limiting its use (<LINK REF="REF-Rawson-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rawson 1998</LINK>).</LI>
<LI>Proparacaine hydrochloride 0.5% instilled into the eyes was simple and safe but no significant effect was observed when compared with placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Kondziolka-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Kondziolka 1994</LINK>) (<LINK REF="SOF-03" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 3</LINK>). In this trial three participants had first division (V1) pain only and a further four had V1 as well as other division involvement. The rest of the participants did not have V1 involvement, therefore they were looking for a systemic effect of the drug. The authors did not report the results separately for the V1 participants but presumably if the drug had worked better in that group they would have reported it. We therefore assume that the trial showed that the drug neither works centrally nor peripherally.</LI>
<LI>The effect of pimozide was evaluated in one double-blind, cross-over RCT (<LINK REF="SOF-04" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 4</LINK>). Adverse effects were common and the authors suggested it should not be chosen as a first-line treatment option (<LINK REF="STD-Lechin-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Lechin 1989</LINK>).</LI>
</OL>
<P>These conclusions are limited by methodological considerations such as the method of randomisation, quality of double-blinding, allocation concealment, study duration and selection of outcome measures. All of the included trials were either inadequately reported or had methodological flaws. The quality problems were as follows:</P>
<OL>
<LI>the method of randomisation and allocation concealment, diagnostic criteria and comparability of the baseline groups were not reported;</LI>
<LI>the washout period was not reported in a cross-over trial;</LI>
<LI>the blinding methods were unclear;</LI>
<LI>dropouts were high and not reported in detail and intention-to-treat analysis was not carried out;</LI>
<LI>the follow-up time was short;</LI>
<LI>the selection of assessment tools was not consistent and adverse effects were not reported in some trials;</LI>
<LI>the participants recruited in some trials were not typical and did not meet the diagnostic criteria for trigeminal neuralgia.</LI>
</OL>
<P>At present we cannot draw any definitive conclusions about the effect and reliability of any non-antiepileptic drug in trigeminal neuralgia.</P>
<P>All these trials were carried out before more rigorous methods were introduced for the conduct of RCTs. No study included a power calculation and the primary and secondary outcome measures were not clearly stated. One of the studies (<LINK REF="STD-Kondziolka-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Kondziolka 1994</LINK>) had a low risk of bias; the other three had an unclear risk of bias.The Initiative on Methods, Measurement, and Pain Assessment in Clinical Trials (IMMPACT) has provided some guidelines on the use of outcome measures which need to be considered when designing future trials in this field (<LINK REF="REF-Dworkin-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dworkin 2005</LINK>). Trials in patients with trigeminal neuralgia are difficult to conduct due to the lack of knowledge about the natural history of the condition. Patients can go into a natural period of complete pain remission, as is reported to have potentially occurred in one participant in the tizanidine study (<LINK REF="STD-Vilming-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Vilming 1986</LINK>). The following outcomes need to be measured: the frequency of attacks of pain, the duration of each attack and the severity of attack. Evoked or spontaneous pain could also be measured as there is a suggestion that this can be altered differently (<LINK REF="REF-Beydoun-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beydoun 2002</LINK>). A 50% pain reduction is considered a good outcome in all chronic pain studies of other conditions but a higher target is possible in patients with trigeminal neuralgia. Quality of life assessment is important because patients may be unable to eat or socialise and if rendered pain-free with drugs they may be unable to walk due to ataxia, diplopia and drowsiness. In the current update of the review we revised our outcomes to include 50% pain reduction and quality of life assessment.</P>
<P>The results of our review are consistent with the previous studies described in the <LINK TAG="BACKGROUND" TYPE="SECTION">Background</LINK> section.</P>

<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2013-11-22 16:49:06 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Ruth Brassington">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2013-11-22 16:49:00 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is low-quality evidence that the effect of tizanidine is not significantly different than that of carbamazepine in treating trigeminal neuralgia. Pimozide is more effective than carbamazepine, although the evidence is low-quality and the data did not allow comparison of adverse event rates. There is also low-quality evidence that 0.5% proparacaine hydrochloride eye drops have no benefit over placebo. Limitations in the data for tocainide prevent any conclusions being drawn.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2013-11-22 16:49:06 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Ruth Brassington">
<P>More research is needed to determine whether non-antiepileptic drugs are beneficial in trigeminal neuralgia. Future trials should describe their methods adequately and use clear inclusion criteria, allocation concealment, randomisation, double-blind assessment, intention-to-treat analysis and long-term follow-up. The length of washout period before interventions, and between periods in cross-over trials, must be adequate. Outcome measures should include the frequency, duration and severity of attacks of pain, and quality of life. Adverse events and the number of and explanation for dropouts must be reported. Trials should be adequately powered.</P>

<P>In the 2011 update, we modified the original protocol. We edited the methods section <LINK TAG="QUALITY_ASSESSMENT" TYPE="SECTION">Assessment of risk of bias in included studies</LINK> according to <LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2008</LINK> and completed a 'Risk of bias' assessment and table for each of the included studies. In <LINK TAG="CRIT_PARTICIPANTS" TYPE="SECTION">Types of participants</LINK> we included all causes of trigeminal neuralgia in which the diagnostic criteria were clearly defined. We also specified that the trials needed to have lasted at least two weeks in total.</P>
<P>In this 2013 update, we excluded quasi-RCTs; the protocol stated that we would include quasi-RCTs (<LINK REF="REF-He-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">He 2006</LINK>) (we found no quasi-RCTs). According to the latest version of <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I>,<I> </I>only RCTs can prevent systematic differences in general characteristics between different intervention groups. We searched the 10 journals that we previously handsearched in the electronic Chinese Biomedical Retrieval System database. We also updated the 'blinding' assessments, and split blinding into blinding of participants and personnel (performance bias) and blinding of outcome assessors (assessment bias) (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). In addition, we added a 'Summary of findings' table in this update.</P>
<P>We revised our outcomes in this update to include 50% pain reduction and quality of life measures.</P>

<SUP>2</SUP>Further downgrading for risk of bias and potential indirectness. Three participants taking tizanidine discontinued taking the optimal dose: two because of lack of efficacy, one due to unrelated disease. Other potential risks of bias were from unclear randomisation, allocation concealment and blinding procedures. Investigators used a non-validated outcome scale.</P>
