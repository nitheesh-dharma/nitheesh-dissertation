<P>Asthma is a condition that affects the airways (tubes carrying air in and out of the lungs). During an asthma exacerbation (attack), the airways narrow and drugs can be taken to dilate, or widen, the airways. Common bronchodilators (medicines used to widen the airways) are short-acting beta<SUB>2</SUB>- agonists (e.g. salbutamol) or anticholinergics (e.g. ipratropium bromide). In this review, we examined if the use of anticholinergic inhalers during an asthma attack in children aged over two years is effective compared to either placebo or another bronchodilator. We also looked at combinations of anticholinergic plus a beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonist compared to an anticholinergic on its own.</P>
<P>We found six small trials of unclear quality answering these two questions. We found data from four trials on 171 children comparing anticholinergics with beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists. Children on anticholinergics alone were significantly more likely to experience treatment failure than those on beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists (odds ratio (OR) 2.27; 95% CI 1.08 to 4.75). We also found data from four trials on 173 children comparing children on anticholinergics alone with children on anticholinergics plus beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists. In this case, treatment failure was more likely in children taking anticholinergics only than if they were combined with beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists (OR 2.65; 95% CI 1.2 to 5.88). We were only able to combine data for treatment failure and hospitalisation.</P>
<P>In summary, we found that inhaled anticholinergics used on their own are less effective than inhaled beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists used alone or in combination with anticholinergics. Inhaled anticholinergics seem safe, with no significant side effects apparent.</P>

<P>Six studies met the inclusion criteria but were limited by small sample sizes, various treatment regimes used and outcomes assessed. The studies were overall of unclear quality. Data could only be pooled for the outcomes of treatment failure and hospitalisation. Other data could not be combined due to divergent outcome measurements. Meta-analysis revealed that children who received anticholinergics alone were significantly more likely to have treatment failure compared to those who received beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists from four trials on 171 children (odds ratio (OR) 2.27; 95% CI 1.08 to 4.75). Also, treatment failure on anticholinergics alone was more likely than when anticholinergics were combined with beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists from four trials on 173 children (OR 2.65; 95% CI 1.2 to 5.88). Data on clinical scores/symptoms that were measured on different scales were conflicting. Individual trials reported that lung function was superior in the combination group when compared with anticholinergic agents used alone. The use of anticholinergics was not found to be associated with significant side effects.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2012-02-12 11:51:26 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Inhaled anticholinergics as single agent bronchodilators (or in combination with beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists) are one of the several medications available for the treatment of acute asthma in children. Ipratropium bromide, an inhaled anticholinergic agent, has been used extensively in emergency departments as adjunctive therapy with beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists for the emergency treatment of acute asthma exacerbations. The objective of this review was to determine the effectiveness of only inhaled anticholinergic drugs (i.e. administered alone), compared to a control or combination treatment in children over the age of two years with acute asthma.</P>
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2012-02-01 09:54:56 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Asthma is an inflammatory disorder of the airways in which many cells and cellular elements play a role. In susceptible individuals, this inflammation causes recurrent episodes of wheezing, breathlessness, chest tightness and cough. These episodes are usually associated with widespread but variable airflow obstruction that is often reversible either spontaneously or with treatment. The inflammation also causes an associated increase in the existing bronchial hyperresponsiveness to a variety of stimuli (<LINK REF="REF-NHLBI-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">NHLBI 2007</LINK>). Airflow obstruction (excessive airway narrowing) in asthma is the result of contraction of the airway smooth muscle and swelling of the airway wall due to smooth muscle hypertrophy and hyperplasia, inflammatory cell infiltration, oedema, goblet cell and mucous gland hyperplasia, mucous hypersecretion, protein deposition including collagen and epithelial desquamation. Potential triggers for the inflammatory process in asthma include allergy, viral respiratory infections, irritants such as tobacco smoke, air pollutants and occupational dusts, gases and chemicals, certain drugs, and non-specific stimuli such as cold air exposure and exercise (<LINK REF="REF-NAC-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">NAC 2006</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2012-02-12 11:50:45 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Inhaled anticholinergics are bronchodilators. Ipratropium bromide is the most studied anticholinergic bronchodilator, and now most widely used of anticholinergic agents. Ipratropium bromide has been used extensively in emergency departments as adjunctive therapy with beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists for the emergency treatment of acute asthma exacerbations. Multiple doses of anticholinergics in combination with beta<SUB>2</SUB>-adrenergic agents have shown to be beneficial in adults (<LINK REF="REF-Undem-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Undem 2001</LINK>) and of some merit in school-aged children with severe asthma exacerbation (<LINK REF="REF-Plotnick-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Plotnick 2008</LINK>). Current guidelines recommend the use of a combination of inhaled beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists and anticholinergics, particularly for patients with acute severe or life-threatening asthma in the emergency setting. Anticholinergics tend not to be used as first-line drugs for asthma exacerbation (<LINK REF="REF-Gross-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gross 1988</LINK>).</P>
<P>Inhaled anticholinergics are the drugs of choice in bronchospasm provoked by psychogenic stimuli and beta<SUB>2</SUB>-blockers (<LINK REF="REF-Gross-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gross 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Beakes-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beakes 1997</LINK>). Ipratropium bromide also appears to have some benefit in nocturnal asthma (<LINK REF="REF-Beakes-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beakes 1997</LINK>). However, the principal clinical use of ipratropium bromide is in the treatment of adult patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (<LINK REF="REF-Brown-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brown 2001</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2012-02-12 11:51:26 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Airway calibre is controlled in health and disease by many influences. The parasympathetic nervous system is one among the many mechanisms, which regulates the airway calibre by varying the bronchomotor tone. Muscarinic receptors are widely distributed in the airways and the release of acetylcholine at these sites results in both smooth muscle contraction and release of secretions from submucosal glands. An opportunity for therapeutic intervention exists at the level of these muscarinic receptors. Anticholinergics such as atropine and its analogues are competitive inhibitors of acetylcholine and may result in bronchodilatation by reducing the tone of smooth muscles (<LINK REF="REF-Gross-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gross 1988</LINK>).</P>
<P>Anticholinergic agents act at muscarinic receptors, competitively inhibiting the effects of acetylcholine. Acetylcholine acts by causing smooth muscle constriction, which provides bronchomotor tone. By antagonising the effects of acetylcholine, cholinergic bronchomotor tone is inhibited and the vagal reflexes that mediate bronchoconstriction are blocked (<LINK REF="REF-McDonald-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">McDonald 2010</LINK>). Cholinergic-induced bronchoconstriction appears to involve primarily the large airways, whereas beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonist medications relax both large and small airway constriction equally (<LINK REF="REF-Rodrigo-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rodrigo 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>Ipratropium bromide (8-isopropyl-noratropine-methobromide) is a synthetic quaternary ammonium congener of atropine. Ipratropium bromide differs from atropine and other naturally occurring anticholinergic alkaloids in one major aspect - it is insoluble in lipids (although freely soluble in water) and crosses biological barriers with difficulty. One could thus describe ipratropium bromide as a topical form of atropine and hence virtually free of systemic side effects. Neither atropine nor ipratropium bromide is selective for the subtypes of muscarinic receptors. It was the first anticholinergic agent to be approved for use as a bronchodilator in adults and children (for acute asthma in children), with a wide therapeutic margin of safety and has no important side effects (<LINK REF="REF-Gross-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gross 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Brown-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brown 2001</LINK>). Ipratropium bromide is a less potent bronchodilator than beta<SUB>2</SUB>-adrenergic agents. The onset of action of ipratropium is slower than short-acting beta<SUB>2</SUB>-adrenergic agents (30 to 90 minutes versus 5 to 15 minutes).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2012-02-03 16:53:42 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The role of anticholinergic drugs for wheezing in children under the age of two years has been reviewed (<LINK REF="REF-Everard-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Everard 2005</LINK>). The authors concluded that there is not enough support for the uncritical use of anticholinergic therapy for wheezing under the age of two years. The review by Plotnick et al focused specifically on combined treatment with anticholinergics and beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists in asthmatic children over the age of two years and concluded that anticholinergics plus beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists have a beneficial effect over beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists alone in improving lung function significantly and the addition of multiple doses of anticholinergics to beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists reduced the risk of hospital admissions in children with predominantly severe exacerbations (<LINK REF="REF-Plotnick-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Plotnick 2008</LINK>). Plotnick et al also found that there was no conclusive evidence for using multiple doses of anticholinergics in children with mild or moderate asthma exacerbations. There is good evidence for the safety and efficacy of frequent doses of ipratropium bromide (every 20 to 30 minutes) used in addition to beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists for the first two hours of a severe asthma attack in children over two years (<LINK REF="REF-BTS-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">BTS 2009</LINK>). The addition of ipratropium bromide to beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists for severe acute asthma may lead to some improvement in clinical symptoms and reduce the need for more intensive treatment in children less than two years. It does not significantly reduce the length of hospital stay either in combination with beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists or in comparison with placebo (<LINK REF="REF-Everard-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Everard 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-BTS-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">BTS 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>When investigating the therapeutic effect of an agent that may be used in combination with another agent, it is important to establish separately the effectiveness of both the agents over placebo. It is also essential to compare the beneficial effect of the combined agents over placebo as well as the individual agents. In this way it is possible to establish: a) if the single agents have a therapeutic effect; and b) if there is an additive or synergistic effect from combining the agents.</P>
<P>This review focuses on the effectiveness of anticholinergic drugs (without beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists) in children aged over two years with acute asthma. By comparing the effect of anticholinergics as single agents with that of other single agents and with combined therapy (anticholinergics with beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists) as reviewed previously (<LINK REF="REF-Plotnick-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Plotnick 2008</LINK>), we aim to establish the role of anticholinergics as a monotherapy in the treatment of children over two years of age with acute asthma.</P>

<P>Definition of treatment failure varied between the studies. <LINK REF="STD-Guill-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Guill 1987</LINK> considered three criteria for treatment failure (return visit to the emergency department within 12 to 24 hours; intravenous (IV) treatment; or admission to hospital). <LINK REF="STD-Watson-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Watson 1988</LINK> considered admission to hospital as treatment failure and <LINK REF="STD-Cook-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Cook 1985</LINK> set IV therapy as indication of treatment failure. <LINK REF="STD-Calvo-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Calvo 1998</LINK> did not report any pre-defined treatment failure criteria, although this study reported that treatment was stopped if the TAL score was less than 2, if there was a poor response to the therapy and/or PEF was less than 15% at first measurement or if there was intolerance to the treatment (TAL score is a clinical scoring system based on several markers such as respiratory rate, wheezing and cyanosis; the scale runs from 0 to 12, where 12 indicates a very severe illness; <LINK REF="REF-Tal-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tal 1983</LINK>).

In one study (<LINK REF="STD-Calvo-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Calvo 1998</LINK>), we considered treatment failure as those children who were poor responders to bronchodilator therapy (PEF + 4% or less). In another study (<LINK REF="STD-Cook-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Cook 1985</LINK>), we considered treatment failure as those children who required intravenous therapy as well as those who required repeat nebulizations of medications. In the study of <LINK REF="STD-Guill-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Guill 1987</LINK> and colleagues, treatment failure was considered as those children who required repeat nebulizations of medications, those who either worsened after nebulized treatment and required alternative therapy (injectable epinephrine) or improved initially after one or two nebulized treatments but deteriorated within one hour and required hospitalisation. We could pool data from three studies that used similar medications (ipratropium versus beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonist) (<LINK REF="STD-Cook-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Cook 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Watson-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Watson 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Calvo-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Calvo 1998</LINK>). Pooled analysis revealed a (just) significant difference between the two groups with those who received ipratropium bromide more likely to have treatment failure compared to those on beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonist (OR 2.36; 95% CI 1.02 to 5.47; <LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>). The addition of <LINK REF="STD-Guill-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Guill 1987</LINK>'s study (to the forest plot) that used atropine sulphate compared to metaproterenol (9/13 versus 8/15, respectively) further strengthened the efficacy of beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists compared to anticholinergic agents (OR 2.27; 95% CI 1.08 to 4.75) as depicted in <LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2012-02-19 11:46:52 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In this review, we evaluated the trials that studied the efficacy of ipratropium bromide given alone or in combination with beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists (compared to a control of beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists) for acute asthma in children aged over two years. Despite an extensive and thorough literature search in which we found hundreds of papers examining anticholinergic drugs, only seven studies (one paper was an abstract from a conference proceedings of a paper (<LINK REF="STD-Van-Bever-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Van Bever 1994</LINK>)) from six trials met the inclusion criteria for the review.<BR/>
</P>
<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-02-19 11:46:52 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We found that inhaled anticholinergic agents as single agent bronchodilators were less efficacious (i.e. led to more treatment failure) than beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists in children over the age of two years with acute asthma exacerbations. Anticholinergics were also less efficacious (i.e. led to more treatment failure) than anticholinergics combined with beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists. In this review, data on clinical scores/symptoms that were measured on different scales were variable but all generally showed that ipratropium bromide used alone was less efficacious compared to beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists or combined with beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists. Also, individual trials reported that lung function was superior in the combination group when compared to anticholinergic agents.</P>
<P>In our review, there was no significant increase in the occurrence of tachycardia, tremor, mydriasis or dryness of oral mucous membranes observed among participants treated with anticholinergic agents. Ipratropium bromide has no or very little systemic toxicity. Another significant advantage to ipratropium bromide in the critically ill asthma patient is the lack of increase in heart rate, which does occur with beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonist use (<LINK REF="REF-Cugell-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cugell 1986</LINK>). The only remarkable reported side effect in the literature is the inhibition of salivary secretions at high doses. When nebulised, ipratropium is very unlikely to affect urinary flow or intraocular tension, and possible effects on the eye (i.e. glaucoma) can be prevented by using a mouthpiece during nebulisation. Although data is not available in children, the speed of onset of effect is reported in adults with airway disease to be 3 to 30 minutes with up to 50% of the response occurring in three minutes and 80% in 30 minutes, with a peak bronchodilator effect observed within one to two hours, and duration of action of up to approximately six hours (<LINK REF="REF-Gross-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gross 1988</LINK>).</P>

<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2012-02-03 16:53:42 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Our thorough systematic search for published and unpublished trials resulted in identification of important trials. We could only extract data from six trials. Despite the small number of studies, we conclude from the studies that inhaled anticholinergic drugs as single agent bronchodilators were less efficacious than beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists and anticholinergics combined with beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2012-02-03 16:53:42 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This systematic review was limited by the quality of existing data. In addition, there was clinical heterogeneity amongst the trials and we could not pool some data due to divergent outcome measurements and different types of anticholinergic agents and bronchodilators used in the studies. The number (i.e. six trials) and size of studies pooled were small. There were limited data on hospital admissions.</P>

<P>In children over the age of two years with acute asthma exacerbations, inhaled anticholinergic drugs as single agent bronchodilators were less efficacious than beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists. Inhaled anticholinergics on their own were also less efficacious than anticholinergics combined with beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists. Thus in children over the age of two years with acute asthma exacerbations, inhaled anticholinergics alone are not appropriate as a single agent. None of the major asthma guidelines currently recommend inhaled anticholinergics as a single agent and our review supports this. The use of anticholinergics was not found to be associated with significant side effects such as tachycardia, tremor, mydriasis or dryness of oral mucous membranes.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2012-02-03 16:53:41 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Inhaled anticholinergics combined with beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists is now the standard recommended treatment in guidelines for children with acute moderate to severe asthma exacerbations. Thus, in light of our conclusion above, we do not recommend any further trials comparing inhaled anticholinergics as a single agent in children with acute asthma exacerbations.</P>
