<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2009-01-29 13:48:28 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Caesarean section is a surgical procedure for delivering a baby. It involves making surgical incisions into the mother's abdominal wall and uterus. These operations are performed if there is a serious medical concern for the mother or baby. Caesarean sections are generally done with regional anaesthesia, either a spinal or epidural block with anaesthetic injected into the area around the spine in the lower back, which makes the mother feel numb from the waist down. Women have increased risks associated with anaesthesia and surgery, and the baby may be more likely to be admitted to a neonatal unit or separated from the mother. </P>
<P>Women having a caesarean section under regional anaesthesia are often highly anxious during the operation and may feel some discomfort. Listening to relaxing music of the woman's choice may lead to better outcomes and less need for treatment.</P>
<P>The review findings indicate that listening to music during planned caesarean section under regional anaesthesia may improve pulse rates and birth satisfaction scores, although the effect sizes were not large enough to indicate a clinically beneficial effect. The review authors identified one controlled trial that randomly assigned 76 women who listened to their preferred music through earphones, or to standard care, but data were available for only 64 women. The music was provided from the beginning of anaesthesia to the end of surgery. The women's heart rates were reduced by some seven beats/minute when measured at the end of contact with the newborn during the intra-operative period and after the surgeon had completed skin suture. Birth satisfaction scores were increased by a mean of 3.4 points on a 35-point scale when women listened to music. Respiration rates were no different for the two groups and neither were levels of anxiety, which decreased at the end of contact with the newborn and again after closing the skin, with no clear difference with or without music. The trial was from Taiwan and reporting of trial methodology was poor.</P>

<P>One trial involving 76 women who planned to have their babies delivered by caesarean section met the inclusion criteria, but data were available for only 64 women. This trial was of low quality with unclear allocation concealment and only a few main clinical outcomes reported for the women. The trial did not report any infant outcomes. It appears that music added to standard care during caesarean section under regional anaesthesia had some impact on pulse rate at the end of maternal contact with the neonate in the intra-operative period (MD -7.50 fewer beats per minute, 95% CI -14.08 to -0.92) and after completion of skin suture for the caesarean section (MD -7.37 fewer beats per minute, 95% CI -13.37 to -1.37). There was also an improvement in the birth satisfaction score (maximum possible score of 35) (MD of 3.38, 95%CI 1.59 to 5.17). Effects on other outcomes were either not significant or not reported in the one included trial.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2009-01-29 10:01:44 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The findings indicate that music during planned caesarean section under regional anaesthesia may improve pulse rate and birth satisfaction score. However, the magnitude of these benefits is small and the methodological quality of the one included trial is questionable. Therefore, the clinical significance of music is unclear. More research is needed to investigate the effects of music during caesarean section under regional anaesthesia on both maternal and infant outcomes, in various ethnic pregnant women, and with adequate sample sizes.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2009-01-29 13:48:57 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Caesarean section is a surgical procedure for delivering a baby through incisions made on the mother's abdominal wall and uterus. Caesarean section is performed for emergency conditions, for example, for fetal distress and cephalopelvic disproportion. It is also electively performed for non-emergencies, e.g. previous caesarean section, breech presentation. Pregnant mothers undergoing caesarean section often experience anxiety in anticipation of the event that may be unfamiliar, uncomfortable or have undesirable results. This anxiety can increase the risk of psychological and physiological complications and delays in postoperative recovery (<LINK REF="REF-Good-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Good 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mok-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mok 2003</LINK>). This anxiety, however, could be reduced by various means including support by their surgeons, nurses and, possibly, music in the operative rooms.</P>
<P>There is evidence to suggest that there are increased maternal risks associated with surgery, including anaesthetic risks, surgical complications, increased blood loss, need for transfusion, and pulmonary embolism (<LINK REF="REF-Kelleher-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kelleher 1994</LINK>). Women may also experience restrictions in their daily activities (<LINK REF="REF-Chippington-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chippington 2004</LINK>) and experience breastfeeding difficulties (<LINK REF="REF-Francome-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Francome 1993</LINK>). Caesarean section may also increase the chances of women experiencing problems in subsequent pregnancies related to uterine scarring (<LINK REF="REF-Hemminki-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hemminki 1996</LINK>). Furthermore, new, unexpected, long-term risks of caesarean section continue to be reported; these include abnormal placentation (<LINK REF="REF-Wu-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wu 2005</LINK>), ectopic pregnancy, haemorrhage and hysterectomy following uterine evacuation, latex allergy, implantation endometriosis, adenomyosis and increased hospital readmission (<LINK REF="REF-Bewley-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bewley 2002</LINK>). Caesarean section has also been associated with emotional difficulties (<LINK REF="REF-Clement-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clement 2001</LINK>) for the woman, including postpartum depression and negative feelings about the experience of childbirth (<LINK REF="REF-Minkoff-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Minkoff 2003</LINK>). Suggested increased risks for babies delivered by caesarean section include increased rates of admission to neonatal units and separation of the mother and neonate (<LINK REF="REF-Treffers-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Treffers 1993</LINK>), iatrogenic prematurity (<LINK REF="REF-Wagner-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wagner 2000</LINK>), laceration (<LINK REF="REF-Smith-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smith 1997</LINK>), increased neonatal respiratory problems (<LINK REF="REF-Madar-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Madar 1999</LINK>) and stillbirth if the mother has previously had a caesarean section (<LINK REF="REF-Smith-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smith 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>Music is an intentional auditory stimulus with organised elements including melody, rhythm, harmony, timbre, form, and style. Repetitive listening allows the listener to identify and predict sounds (<LINK REF="REF-Standley-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Standley 2002</LINK>). Thus, repeated exposure may enhance clinical effects (<LINK REF="REF-Kemper-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kemper 2005</LINK>). An observational study (<LINK REF="REF-Good-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Good 2000</LINK>) found that musical choices were related to cultural background of patients admitted to hospitals. Music was found to enhance well being in a randomised crossover trial (<LINK REF="REF-McCraty-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">McCraty 1998</LINK>). Other studies report that music reduced stress and distracted adult hospital patients from unpleasant symptoms (in a systematic review of RCTs by <LINK REF="REF-Evans-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Evans 2002</LINK> and also in a quasi-experimental study by <LINK REF="REF-Shertzer-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shertzer 2001</LINK>). Although there are wide variations in individual preferences, music appears to exert direct physiologic effects through the autonomic nervous system. For example, one randomised trial in which outcomes were measured repeatedly (<LINK REF="REF-White-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">White 1999</LINK>) and two quasi-intervention studies (<LINK REF="REF-Umemura-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Umemura 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Urakawa-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Urakawa 2005</LINK>) report that listening to classical music may increase the heart rate variability, whereas listening to noise or rock music may decrease heart rate variability (reflecting greater stress) in healthy subjects. Music has also been found to have indirect effects by modifying caregiver behaviour. A randomised controlled trial (RCT) (<LINK REF="REF-Lepage-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lepage 2001</LINK>) and two quasi-intervention studies (<LINK REF="REF-Haun-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haun 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Yung--2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yung 2002</LINK>) found that music effectively reduced anxiety and improved the mood of medical and surgical patients, patients in intensive care units and patients undergoing procedures. Music is a low-cost intervention that may reduce surgical, procedural, acute, and chronic pain. However, the findings are from many studies that have methodological problems, such as small sample sizes, lack of randomisation, and lack of control for patient anaesthesia (<LINK REF="REF-Kemper-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kemper 2005</LINK>). Furthermore, a systematic review of RCTs on music for pain relief (<LINK REF="REF-Cepeda-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cepeda 2006</LINK>) found that the beneficial effect of music on pain intensity levels and opioid requirements was unclear.</P>
<P>Other studies have found that music improved the quality of life for patients receiving palliative care (<LINK REF="REF-Hilliard-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hilliard 2003</LINK>), enhancing a sense of comfort and relaxation according to results from a pre and post study (<LINK REF="REF-Burns-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burns 2001</LINK>) and two RCTs (<LINK REF="REF-Cassileth-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cassileth 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Smith-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smith 2001</LINK>). A quasi-intervention study (<LINK REF="REF-Allen-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Allen 1994</LINK>) and another RCT (<LINK REF="REF-Bittman-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bittman 2003</LINK>) show that providing music to caregivers may be a cost-effective and enjoyable strategy to improve empathy, compassion, and relationship-centred care while not increasing errors or interfering with the technical aspects of care.</P>
<P>Music's ability to slow respiratory rates and decrease the stress response appears to be beneficial during labour. It has been reported that music shortened labour in an observational study (<LINK REF="REF-Winokur-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Winokur 1984</LINK>). Even when the course of labour does not speed up when music is utilised, the perceived length of labour decreases, as shown in a quasi-intervention study (<LINK REF="REF-Clark-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clark 1981</LINK>). A review by <LINK REF="REF-McKinney-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">McKinney 1990</LINK> and a self-controlled experiment by <LINK REF="REF-Hanser-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hanser 1983</LINK> have both found that when music is played, pain is decreased.</P>
<P>The efficacy of music for premature infants was reported in a nonsystematic review of literature by <LINK REF="REF-Standley-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Standley 2002</LINK>, and their findings suggest that music is clinically useful for the care of this group. One cohort study describes the use of medical resonant music as preoperative preparation for caesarean section. Music is thought to influence cortical dynamics and through it subcortical and vegetative areas of the nervous system (<LINK REF="REF-Wein-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wein 1997</LINK>). Such influence is thought to cause an integration and synchronisation of different activity systems within the human body, strengthening psycho-physiological defences and improving health conditions (<LINK REF="REF-Gerasimovich-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gerasimovich 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gerasimovich-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gerasimovich 1999</LINK>).<B> </B>Compared with a control group of women who received sedatives for preoperative preparation, the intervention group receiving Medical Resonance Therapy music (MRT-music) had lower cortisol levels and noted better sleep and less need for analgesics postoperatively (<LINK REF="REF-Sidorenko-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sidorenko 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>Most caesarean sections are performed under epidural or spinal block where the pregnant women is anaesthetised from the waist down. However, there is often some degree of discomfort for the woman before the baby is born, when the uterus is manipulated. Music may be useful during caesarean section under regional anaesthesia in terms of improving outcomes for the mother and baby but thus far there has not been a systematic review on this topic.</P>

<STUDY_DESCRIPTION MODIFIED="2009-01-29 13:49:55 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The search strategy identified two potentially relevant studies. We excluded one (<LINK REF="STD-Reza-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Reza 2007</LINK>) because the caesarean section was done under general anaesthesia (see '<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_EXCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of excluded studies</LINK>').</P>
<P>We included one RCT in this review (<LINK REF="STD-Chang-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Chang 2005</LINK>). For more information see '<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>'. The trial was undertaken in a medical centre in southern Taiwan between June and October 2002, and evaluated the effects of music on women&#8217;s clinical and psychological measures, such as anxiety and satisfaction during caesarean section. Seventy-six women, scheduled to deliver their babies by caesarean section, were eligible following initial assessment and allocation. Thirty-eight women were each randomly assigned to either the intervention (music added to standard care) or the control group (standard care alone). Consent to receive music was given after random allocation. There were six women in the intervention group who declined participation for various reasons: two lost interest; two received sedative/nitrous oxide; one had a newborn with imperforate anus; and one had failure of local anaesthesia. Six women participating in the control group dropped out for the following reasons: two had an emergency caesarean section; and four received sedative/nitrous oxide. In total, 64 randomised women were studied, with 32 each in the intervention and control groups. For the intervention group, women received standard care plus listening to music through earphones using a compact disc player. Women chose their preferred music from either western classical, new age or Chinese religious music. Music listening started from the beginning of anaesthesia to the end of surgery, and lasted at least 30 minutes. Mean listening time was 87.59 minutes (SD 13.01).<B> </B>For the control group, women received standard care without music. The trial reported the women's self-assessed anxiety (measured using the Visual Analogue Scale for Anxiety (VASA), which consists of a 10 cm horizontal line with the descriptors 'no anxiety' at the left extent and 'worst possible anxiety' at the right extent (<LINK REF="REF-Gift-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gift 1989</LINK>)). Clinical measures reported by <LINK REF="STD-Chang-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Chang 2005</LINK> include: pulse haemoglobin oxygen saturation (SpO<SUB>2 </SUB>(%)); finger temperature (<SUP>o</SUP> F); respiration rate (per minute); pulse rates (beats/minute); systolic blood pressure (mmHg); and diastolic blood pressure (mmHg).</P>
<P>Data was collected at three points: in the operation room prior to anaesthesia and caesarean section (pre-test); at the end of maternal contact with the neonate in the intra-operation period (post-test I); and after completion of skin suture for the caesarean section (post-test II). The trial also reported the women's birth satisfaction, as assessed by the Satisfaction of Caesarean Delivery Scale (SCDS) and measured at the post-test II period only. The SCDS was designed specifically for the study; for more information about this instrument see <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>. The baseline characteristics of the two groups are given in <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>.</P>

<STUDY_QUALITY MODIFIED="2009-01-29 10:01:44 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The one included trial was assessed as having 'unclear' information in five domains of risk of bias: sequence generation; allocation concealment; blinding; free selective reporting; and free other risk of bias. Women eligible for inclusion were sequentially recruited and then randomly allocated to the intervention or control groups. It was not feasible to blind the participants and clinicians to music. Outcome assessors for VASA scores and birth satisfaction were not blinded because the outcomes were self assessed by the participants themselves. However, the trial does not report on blinding of outcome assessors for clinical outcomes. The analysis was not done on an intention-to-treat basis because 12 patients (six in the intervention group and six in the control group) were excluded after randomisation. Outcomes were measured from a total of 64 women: 32 women in the intervention group and 32 women in the control group. Selective outcome reporting cannot be ruled out because the trial protocol was not available to compare the planned outcomes with those reported.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2009-01-29 13:55:02 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review aimed to assess the effectiveness of music during caesarean section under regional anaesthesia for improving clinical and psychological outcomes for mothers and infants.</P>
<P>We included only one trial (Chang 2005) involving 64 of 78 randomised women. Outcomes included SpO<SUB>2</SUB>, respiration rates, pulse rates, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and VASA anxiety score as primary outcomes and birth satisfaction as a secondary outcome. There were no statistically significant differences between the intervention and control groups for most outcomes. There were statistical significantly differences between the intervention and control groups for pulse rates and birth satisfaction. However, the effect sizes were small and may not suggest a clinically beneficial effect of music. Although the mean VASA scores were lower in the intervention group than in the control group at the two post-test periods, the data are skewed, so statistically significant differences cannot be ruled out.</P>
<P>The included trial may be of limited generalisability to clinical practice. The trial was conducted in Taiwan, with data from only 64 women available for inclusion in the final analysis. Three types of music (Western classical, new age and Chinese religious) might have different effects on outcomes. The number of women choosing each type of music was not available. We, therefore, cannot rule out differential effects on maternal outcomes resulting from the type of music. The maternal outcomes were limited to anxiety, some clinical outcomes and birth satisfaction. No infant outcomes were reported. The reporting of trial methodology was poor and there was no information available in relation to randomisation methods and allocation concealment. In this included study it was not possible to blind the assessors, as it would have been obvious which women were in the receiving music therapy (the intervention group) because they were wearing earphones connected to a compact disc player. In addition, risk of attrition bias (drop-out) was possible since 12 patients were excluded after randomisation. These factors limit the methodological strength of the evidence.</P>

<P>The findings of this review indicate that music during caesarean section under regional anaesthesia may have positive effects on pulse rates and birth satisfaction of mothers. However, the poor methodological quality of the one included study makes it impossible to draw any firm conclusions about the effectiveness of music during caesarean section under regional anaesthesia for improving maternal and infant outcomes.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2009-01-29 10:01:44 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>More research is needed in order to evaluate the effects of music during caesarean section under regional anaesthesia. Future RCTs with good methodology, in terms of randomisation methods, concealment, and blinded outcome assessors, should be undertaken involving different types of music, adequate sample sizes, and pregnant women from a variety of different ethnic groups.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Data analysis</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Measures of treatment effect</HEADING>
<P>In subsequent updates of this review we plan to use standardised mean difference to combine trials measuring the same outcome, but using different methods. For dichotomous data we will use relative risk with 95% confidence intervals (CI) and the corresponding number needed to treat. For continuous data we will use mean differences with 95% confidence intervals (CI) if the outcomes are measured in the same way among trials.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Assessment of heterogeneity</HEADING>
<P>We will assess heterogeneity using the I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2003</LINK>). If we identify high levels of heterogeneity among the trials (exceeding 50%), we will explore it by prespecified subgroup analysis.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Subgroup analyses</HEADING>
<P>We will conduct subgroup analyses classifying for potential sources of heterogeneity including ethnic groups (i.e. Caucasian, African, Latino, and Asian), types of music (i.e. mother's or investigator's preference and genre), methods of music delivery (via loud speakers or headphone), elective versus emergency caesarean section, and primary versus multiple caesarean section, where sufficient data are available. If trials in individual subgroups of the potential factor are thought to be heterogeneous by interaction test as described by <LINK REF="REF-Deeks-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deeks 2001</LINK>, we will not estimate an overall summary but present each specific subgroup effect size.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Cluster-randomised trials</HEADING>
<P>We will include cluster-randomised trials in the analyses along with individually randomised trials. We will adjust their sample sizes according to the methods described in <LINK REF="REF-Gates-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gates 2005</LINK>, using an estimate of the intracluster correlation co-efficient (ICC) derived from the trial (if possible), or from another source. If ICCs from other sources are used, we will report this and conduct sensitivity analyses to investigate the effect of variation in the ICC. If we identify both cluster-randomised trials and individually randomised trials, we plan to synthesise the relevant information. We will consider it reasonable to combine the results from both if there is little heterogeneity between the study designs and the interaction between the effect of intervention and the choice of randomisations unit is considered to be unlikely.</P>
<P>We will also acknowledge heterogeneity in the randomisations unit and perform a separate meta-analysis. Therefore, the meta-analysis will be performed in two parts as well.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Dealing with missing data</HEADING>
<P>We will analyse data on all participants with available data in the group to which they are allocated, regardless of whether or not they received the allocated intervention. If in the original reports participants are not analysed in the group to which they were randomised, and there is sufficient information in the trial report, we will attempt to restore them to the correct group. In addition, other strategies are planned for handling of missing data. If possible, we will contact the trial authors for requesting missing data. Imputation of missing data following with sensitivity analysis will be performed for considering the impact of missing data on robustness of the results.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Assessment of publication bias</HEADING>
<P>We will consider publication bias using funnel plots of between-treatment effect and its precision on individual trials, and Egger's test (<LINK REF="REF-Egger-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Egger 1997</LINK>). If we find asymmetrical funnel plots with statistical publication bias, we will further examine the effect of the bias on the meta-analysis conclusion using sensitivity analyses.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Sensitivity analyses</HEADING>
<P>We will carry out sensitivity analyses to explore the effect of trial quality and, where appropriate, cluster-randomised trials, on the review's conclusions. The trial quality will involve an analysis based on concealment of allocation. Trials with clearly inadequate allocation of concealment will be excluded in order to assess for any substantive difference on the overall result. For the clustering effect, we will perform a sensitivity analysis to see what the effect of different values of the ICC on the results of the analysis would be.</P>
