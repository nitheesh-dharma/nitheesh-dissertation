<TITLE>Rehabilitation for ankle fractures in adults</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2012-10-10 23:35:05 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Ankle fracture is one of the most common fractures of the lower limb, especially in older women and young men. It is generally treated surgically or non-surgically, followed by a period of immobilisation to prevent complications such as malunion. Because of the fracture and the subsequent immobilisation period, people often experience pain, stiffness, weakness and swelling at the ankle, and a reduced ability to participate in activities. This review looked at the evidence on the effects of different rehabilitation interventions for these fractures.</P>
<P>Rehabilitation for ankle fracture can begin soon after the fracture has been treated, either surgically or non-surgically, by the use of different types of immobilisation that allow early commencement of weight-bearing or exercise. Alternatively, rehabilitation, including the use of physical or manual therapies, may start following the period of immobilisation.</P>
<P>Thirty-eight studies with a total of 1,896 participants were included in the review. Many of the trials were potentially biased.</P>
<P>Three studies examined rehabilitation interventions that started during the immobilisation period after non-surgical treatment. There is some very limited evidence of short term benefit of one type of brace compared with immobilisation with a cast or orthosis. There was no evidence for hypnosis.</P>
<P>Thirty studies investigated rehabilitation interventions that started during the immobilisation period after surgical treatment. Ten of these compared the use of a removable type of immobilisation combined with exercise with cast immobilisation alone. There is some evidence from these that using a removable brace or splint so that gentle ankle exercises can be performed during the immobilisation period may enhance the return to normal activities, reduce pain and improve ankle movement. However, the incidence of adverse events (such as problems with the surgical wound) may also be increased. Starting walking early may also slightly improve ankle movement. One small and biased study showed that neurostimulation, an electrotherapy modality, may be beneficial in the short-term. There was little and inconclusive evidence on what type of support or immobilisation was the best.</P>
<P>Five studies investigated different rehabilitation interventions that started after the immobilisation period. There is no evidence of improved function for stretching or manual therapy when either of these are added to an exercise programme, or for an exercise programme when this is compared with usual care. One small and potentially biased study found reduced ankle swelling after non-thermal compared with thermal pulsed shortwave diathermy.</P>

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2012-10-10 09:53:57 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We searched the Specialised Registers of the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group and the Cochrane Rehabilitation and Related Therapies Field, CENTRAL via <I>The Cochrane Library</I> (2011 Issue 7), MEDLINE via PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, PEDro, AMED, SPORTDiscus and clinical trials registers up to July 2011. In addition, we searched reference lists of included studies and relevant systematic reviews.</P>

<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2012-10-10 11:15:25 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials with adults undergoing any interventions for rehabilitation after ankle fracture were considered. The primary outcome was activity limitation. Secondary outcomes included quality of life, patient satisfaction, impairments and adverse events.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2012-10-10 13:49:26 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two review authors independently screened search results, assessed risk of bias and extracted data. Risk ratios and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were calculated for dichotomous variables, and mean differences or standardised mean differences and 95% CIs were calculated for continuous variables. End of treatment and end of follow-up data were presented separately. For end of follow-up data, short term follow-up was defined as up to three months after randomisation, and long-term follow-up as greater than six months after randomisation. Meta-analysis was performed where appropriate.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-10-10 23:29:58 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Thirty-eight studies with a total of 1896 participants were included. Only one study was judged at low risk of bias. Eight studies were judged at high risk of selection bias because of lack of allocation concealment and over half the of the studies were at high risk of selective reporting bias.</P>
<P>Three small studies investigated rehabilitation interventions during the immobilisation period after conservative orthopaedic management. There was limited evidence from two studies (106 participants in total) of short-term benefit of using an air-stirrup versus an orthosis or a walking cast. One study (12 participants) found 12 weeks of hypnosis did not reduce activity or improve other outcomes.</P>
<P>Thirty studies investigated rehabilitation interventions during the immobilisation period after surgical fixation. In 10 studies, the use of a removable type of immobilisation combined with exercise was compared with cast immobilisation alone. Using a removable type of immobilisation to enable controlled exercise significantly reduced activity limitation in five of the eight studies reporting this outcome, reduced pain (number of participants with pain at the long term follow-up: 10/35 versus 25/34; risk ratio (RR) 0.39, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.22 to 0.68; 2 studies) and improved ankle dorsiflexion range of motion. However, it also led to a higher rate of mainly minor adverse events (49/201 versus 20/197; RR 2.30, 95% CI 1.49 to 3.56; 7 studies).</P>
<P>During the immobilisation period after surgical fixation, commencing weight-bearing made a small improvement in ankle dorsiflexion range of motion (mean difference in the difference in range of motion compared with the non-fractured side at the long term follow-up 6.17%, 95% CI 0.14 to 12.20; 2 studies). Evidence from one small but potentially biased study (60 participants) showed that neurostimulation, an electrotherapy modality, may be beneficial in the short-term. There was little and inconclusive evidence on what type of support or immobilisation was the best. One study found no immobilisation improved ankle dorsiflexion and plantarflexion range of motion compared with cast immobilisation, but another showed using a backslab improved ankle dorsiflexion range of motion compared with using a bandage.</P>
<P>Five studies investigated different rehabilitation interventions following the immobilisation period after either conservative or surgical orthopaedic management. There was no evidence of effect for stretching or manual therapy in addition to exercise, or exercise compared with usual care. One small study (14 participants) at a high risk of bias found reduced ankle swelling after non-thermal compared with thermal pulsed shortwave diathermy.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2012-07-06 00:54:29 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is limited evidence supporting early commencement of weight-bearing and the use of a removable type of immobilisation to allow exercise during the immobilisation period after surgical fixation. Because of the potential increased risk of adverse events, the patient's ability to comply with the use of a removable type of immobilisation to enable controlled exercise is essential. There is little evidence for rehabilitation interventions during the immobilisation period after conservative orthopaedic management and no evidence for stretching, manual therapy or exercise compared to usual care following the immobilisation period. Small, single studies showed that some electrotherapy modalities may be beneficial. More clinical trials that are well-designed and adequately-powered are required to strengthen current evidence.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2012-07-29 14:56:37 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Lindsey Elstub">
<P>Ankle fracture is a term used to describe fracture of the distal tibia or fibula (<LINK REF="REF-Whittle-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Whittle 2003</LINK>). It is one of the most common lower limb fractures (<LINK REF="REF-Lash-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lash 2002</LINK>), and the frequency has been increasing over the past few decades (<LINK REF="REF-Bengner-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bengner 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kannus-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kannus 1996</LINK>). The annual incidence of ankle fracture is between 107 to 184 per 100,000 persons (<LINK REF="REF-Bengner-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bengner 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Court_x002d_Brown-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Court-Brown 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Daly-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Daly 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jensen-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jensen 1998</LINK>). The most common causes of ankle fracture are twisting injuries and falls, followed by sports injuries (<LINK REF="REF-Court_x002d_Brown-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Court-Brown 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Daly-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Daly 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jensen-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jensen 1998</LINK>). The peak incidence of ankle fracture is seen in middle-aged to older women and young men (<LINK REF="REF-Court_x002d_Brown-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Court-Brown 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jensen-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jensen 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>Depending mainly on its severity, ankle fracture is treated with or without surgery, usually followed by a period of immobilisation (<LINK REF="REF-Lesic-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lesic 2004</LINK>). Surgical management generally comprises open reduction, to reposition the fractured parts, and internal fixation of the fracture using osteosynthesis material such as wires, screws and other devices. After surgery, the ankle can be immobilised in a cast, splinted, bandaged or left unsupported. In conservative management, the fracture if displaced is reduced by manipulation of the fractured parts through the skin and then the ankle is stabilised by cast or split immobilisation. Immobilisation can result in decreased range of motion, muscle atrophy and decreased peak muscle torque at the ankle (<LINK REF="REF-Chesworth-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chesworth 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shaffer-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Shaffer 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stevens-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stevens 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vandenborne-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vandenborne 1998</LINK>). The majority of these changes occur within the first two weeks of immobilisation (<LINK REF="STD-Shaffer-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Shaffer 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stevens-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stevens 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vandenborne-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vandenborne 1998</LINK>). In addition, ankle fracture can be accompanied by other injuries, which may further impair recovery. These injuries include damage to the cartilage and ligaments, the existence of free bodies within the intra-articular space, and diastasis of the distal tibio-fibular joint (<LINK REF="REF-Ono-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ono 2004</LINK>). Consequently, people with an ankle fracture often experience pain, stiffness, weakness, swelling, limitations in activities such as stair climbing and walking (<LINK REF="STD-Shaffer-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Shaffer 2000</LINK>), and reduced participation in work and recreation. Some people continue to report reduced participation (<LINK REF="REF-Belcher-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Belcher 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lesic-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lesic 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nilsson-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nilsson 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ponzer-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ponzer 1999</LINK>), increased complaints in the extremities and spine, and fatigue (<LINK REF="REF-van-der-Sluis-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">van der Sluis 1998</LINK>) years after the initial injury.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2012-07-04 03:07:09 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Lindsey Elstub">
<P>A number of rehabilitation interventions are used to address the sequelae of ankle fracture and immobilisation. Rehabilitation may begin during the period of immobilisation, where a patient may commence early passive (<LINK REF="STD-Davies-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Davies 1991</LINK>) or active (<LINK REF="STD-Dogra-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Dogra 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hedstrom-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Hedstrom 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lehtonen-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Lehtonen 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tropp-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Tropp 1995</LINK>) exercises, or early weight-bearing (<LINK REF="STD-Ahl-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Ahl 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ahl-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Ahl 1988</LINK>). Alternatively, rehabilitation may start following the period of immobilisation, where interventions may include exercise (<LINK REF="STD-Moseley-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Moseley 2005</LINK>) and manual therapy (<LINK REF="STD-Wilson-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Wilson 1991</LINK>). Methods of immobilisation include casts (custom-made immobilisation made of plaster or synthetic material), backslabs (half casts) and orthoses (commercially available braces), and were considered as a part of rehabilitation for this review as they may facilitate or restrict the commencement of other rehabilitation interventions during the immobilisation period, such as weight-bearing and exercise.</P>

<THEORY MODIFIED="2012-10-10 11:58:09 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The initial conservative or surgical management of an ankle fracture aims to restore the anatomy and stability of the ankle. Immobilisation is thought to provide the optimal environment for fracture healing. It is used to minimise the risk of non-union or malunion at the fracture site. However, immobilisation also increases the risk of ankle stiffness, weakness, swelling and residual pain. While immobilised, weight-bearing is either restricted or not permitted, with consequent reduction of general mobility and functioning. Rehabilitation is aimed at improving participation in work and leisure activities, restoring mobility and reducing pain and other impairments.</P>

<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2012-07-29 14:59:15 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2008 (<LINK REF="REF-Lin-2008a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lin 2008a</LINK>). In <LINK REF="REF-Lin-2008a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lin 2008a</LINK>, we identified 31 studies which supported the judicious use of early weight-bearing or exercise during the immobilisation period to improve activity limitation or ankle range of motion, and manual therapy after the immobilisation period to improve ankle range of motion. There was no evidence for other therapies. Overall the evidence was limited as it was mainly based on individual studies. We updated the review given that additional studies had since been published.</P>

<OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2012-07-29 15:01:37 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>To assess the effects of rehabilitation interventions following conservative or surgical treatment of ankle fractures in adults. The primary outcome was activity limitation; and secondary outcomes were quality of life, patient satisfaction, pain, ankle range of motion, strength, swelling and adverse events.</P>

<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS MODIFIED="2012-07-29 15:04:45 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included studies of adult participants of either sex who had presented to a hospital or community setting for rehabilitation following ankle fracture. Allocation to treatment group must have been within three months of ankle fracture, and participants could have had either conservative or surgical orthopaedic management. We anticipated that group allocation was likely to occur within days after orthopaedic management for studies investigating the effectiveness of interventions administered during the period of immobilisation. Conversely, we anticipated that allocation would occur some weeks after orthopaedic management for studies of rehabilitation following a period of immobilisation.</P>
<P>We excluded studies conducted exclusively on participants with multi-trauma, pathological fracture or established complications secondary to ankle fracture (e.g. non-union). Studies conducted exclusively on patients with tibial pilon or plafond fracture, which is defined as intra-articular fracture of the distal tibia (<LINK REF="REF-Whittle-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Whittle 2003</LINK>), or fracture of the talus were also excluded. Trials with mixed populations of adults and children were included if data for the adult population were reported separately.</P>

<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS MODIFIED="2012-10-10 14:32:12 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included any rehabilitation intervention (e.g. different orthoses, early weight-bearing, ankle exercises, electrotherapy, manual therapy, stretching) employed by any health professional (e.g. physiotherapist, doctor) started at or after orthopaedic management (i.e. conservative orthopaedic management or surgical fixation) of ankle fracture. Eligible studies were grouped according to the timing of the commencement of intervention (i.e. during or after the period of immobilisation), the orthopaedic management if interventions were administered during the immobilisation period, and the type of intervention. Thus, interventions investigated by the included studies were grouped under three categories:</P>
<P>1. Rehabilitation interventions during the immobilisation period after conservative management<BR/>2. Rehabilitation interventions during the immobilisation period after surgical fixation<BR/>3. Rehabilitation interventions following the immobilisation period after either conservative or surgical management<BR/>
</P>
<P>Included interventions could be compared with placebo, no treatment or another rehabilitation intervention. Studies were excluded if they occurred before orthopaedic management, or examined pharmaceutical or surgical intervention alone.</P>

<CRIT_OUTCOMES MODIFIED="2012-10-10 11:58:28 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Lindsey Elstub">
<P>To be considered for our review, studies must have included at least one of the following outcome measures.</P>
<CRIT_OUTCOMES_PRIMARY MODIFIED="2012-07-29 15:08:51 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Lindsey Elstub">
<P>The primary outcome was activity limitation, which could be measured by questionnaires or performance tests. Questionnaires were the preferred primary outcome measure in instances where activity limitation was measured by a questionnaire and a performance test, because questionnaires tend to have more robust measurement properties (<LINK REF="REF-Andersson-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Andersson 2010</LINK>). Possible questionnaires include the Olerud Molander Ankle Score (<LINK REF="REF-Olerud-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Olerud 1984</LINK>) and the Lower Extremity Functional Scale (<LINK REF="REF-Binkley-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Binkley 1999</LINK>). Possible tests include timed walking or stair climbing tasks (<LINK REF="STD-Moseley-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Moseley 2005</LINK>).</P>
</CRIT_OUTCOMES_PRIMARY>
<CRIT_OUTCOMES_SECONDARY MODIFIED="2012-10-10 11:58:28 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Lindsey Elstub">
<P>Secondary outcome measures were quality of life, patient satisfaction, and the impairment measures of pain, ankle dorsiflexion and plantarflexion range of motion, strength, swelling and adverse events. Examples of quality of life measures include Short Form 36 (<LINK REF="REF-Ware-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ware 1992</LINK>) and Assessment of Quality of Life (<LINK REF="REF-Hawthorne-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hawthorne 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>We anticipated that studies would have a variety of methods to assess pain, range of motion, strength and swelling. Pain can be measured with scales such as the numerical rating scale (<LINK REF="REF-Downie-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Downie 1978</LINK>), visual analogue scale (<LINK REF="REF-Huskisson-1974" TYPE="REFERENCE">Huskisson 1974</LINK>), or McGill Pain Questionnaire (<LINK REF="REF-Melzack-1975" TYPE="REFERENCE">Melzack 1975</LINK>). Goniometry (<LINK REF="STD-Lehtonen-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Lehtonen 2003</LINK>) or the weight-bearing lunge test (<LINK REF="REF-Bennell-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bennell 1998</LINK>) are among the common tests for range of motion, and torque is one of the ways to measure strength (<LINK REF="STD-Shaffer-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Shaffer 2000</LINK>). Examples of ways to measure swelling include ankle circumference (<LINK REF="STD-Airaksinen-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Airaksinen 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lehtonen-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Lehtonen 2003</LINK>) and volumetric measurements (<LINK REF="STD-Christie-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Christie 1990</LINK>).</P>
<P>For adverse events, we were especially interested if there were cases of delayed union (malunion or non-union) or pain resulting in cessation of the intervention. Authors of studies were contacted for reasons for withdrawals and dropouts, as they may have been related to adverse events.</P>

<P>In <LINK REF="REF-Lin-2008a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lin 2008a</LINK>, we assessed methodological quality using the PEDro scale (<LINK REF="REF-Maher-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maher 2003</LINK>). For this update, we used the 'Risk of bias' tool provided by The Cochrane Collaboration (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). We assessed selection bias (random sequence generation and allocation concealment), performance and detection bias (blinding of participants, treatment providers and outcome assessors), attrition bias (completeness of outcome data), reporting bias (selection of outcomes reported) and other sources of bias (e.g. baseline comparability). Bias might be introduced if study groups are not comparable at baseline. Therefore, we assessed the studies' baseline comparability on the important participant characteristics and a key outcome measure as a potential other source of bias. Our presentation of bias relating to blinding includes both performance and detection bias as in the first version of the risk of bias tool (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>The risk of bias was assessed by two independent review authors. In order to present the risk of bias in a universal manner in this update, studies included in the earlier review were also assessed using The Cochrane Collaboration's tool. Review authors did not evaluate the risk of bias of studies in which they were involved; these studies were evaluated by other authors.</P>

<EFFECT_MEASURES MODIFIED="2012-07-04 03:09:15 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Lindsey Elstub">
<P>We anticipated that most of our outcome measures would be continuous, with the exception of adverse events and dropouts, which would be dichotomous. For dichotomous variables, risk ratios (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were calculated. For continuous variables, mean differences (MDs) and 95% CIs were calculated if studies used the same outcome measure. Standardised mean differences (SMDs) and 95% CIs were calculated if studies used different measures to assess the same outcome (e.g. measuring activity limitation with the Olerud Molander Ankle Score or the Lower Extremity Function Scale) and the studies were pooled.</P>

<P>Six studies investigated the effectiveness of starting weight-bearing during the immobilisation period. In three of these studies, participants in the treatment group started to weight-bear from the first post-operative day, and those in the control group started weight-bearing four weeks later (<LINK REF="STD-Ahl-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Ahl 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ahl-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Ahl 1987</LINK>) or at the end of the immobilisation period (<LINK REF="STD-Finsen-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Finsen 1989</LINK>).

<P>Thirteen studies investigated the effectiveness of exercise during the immobilisation period, in which participants in the treatment group commenced exercise, but those in the control group did not. The most common form of exercise prescribed was active (<LINK REF="STD-DiStasio-1994" TYPE="STUDY">DiStasio 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dogra-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Dogra 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Egol-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Egol 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Finsen-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Finsen 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hedstrom-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Hedstrom 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lehtonen-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Lehtonen 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rasmussen-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Rasmussen 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sondenaa-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Sondenaa 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tropp-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Tropp 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vioreanu-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Vioreanu 2007</LINK>) or passive (<LINK REF="STD-Davies-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Davies 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-DiStasio-1994" TYPE="STUDY">DiStasio 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Egol-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Egol 2000</LINK>) ankle range of motion exercises, but some studies also included strengthening and functional exercises (<LINK REF="STD-DiStasio-1994" TYPE="STUDY">DiStasio 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tropp-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Tropp 1995</LINK>).

To enable performance of the exercises, participants in the treatment groups wore a removable type of immobilisation (i.e. backslab, orthosis, brace, air-stirrup) or had no immobilisation. Participants in the control groups typically received a cast that could not be removed.</P>
<P>Two studies investigated the effectiveness of commencing both weight-bearing and exercise during the immobilisation period (<LINK REF="STD-Franke-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Franke 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Honigmann-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Honigmann 2007</LINK>). Participants in the treatment group used an orthosis for immobilisation, performed ankle range of motion exercises and were allowed to commence weight-bearing earlier than the control group. Participants in the control group used a cast (<LINK REF="STD-Franke-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Franke 2008</LINK>) or splint (<LINK REF="STD-Honigmann-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Honigmann 2007</LINK>) and then bandage, and performed no exercise. Participants in the control group of <LINK REF="STD-Franke-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Franke 2008</LINK> attended physiotherapy three times a week for four weeks following their six weeks immobilisation period.</P>
<P>Four studies investigated the effectiveness of electrotherapy during the immobilisation period after surgical fixation. The interventions were ultrasound for bone healing (<LINK REF="STD-Handolin-2005a" TYPE="STUDY">Handolin 2005a</LINK>), electrical stimulation for muscle strength (<LINK REF="STD-Hernandez-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Hernandez 2006</LINK>), non-invasive interactive neurostimulation (<LINK REF="STD-Gorodetskyi-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Gorodetskyi 2010</LINK>) and interferential therapy (<LINK REF="STD-Christie-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Christie 1990</LINK>).</P>

<P>Activity limitation was measured in 23 included studies using questionnaires. The most commonly used questionnaire was the Olerud Molander Ankle Score (<LINK REF="STD-Dogra-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Dogra 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Handolin-2005a" TYPE="STUDY">Handolin 2005a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hedstrom-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Hedstrom 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hernandez-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Hernandez 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Honigmann-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Honigmann 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lehtonen-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Lehtonen 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nilsson-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Nilsson 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rasmussen-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Rasmussen 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Siddique-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Siddique 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tropp-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Tropp 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-van-Laarhoven-1996" TYPE="STUDY">van Laarhoven 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vioreanu-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Vioreanu 2007</LINK>). Other questionnaires used were Clinical Demerit Points (based on the Weber protocol; <LINK REF="STD-Finsen-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Finsen 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hughes-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hughes 1979</LINK>), Lower Extremity Functional Scale (<LINK REF="STD-Lin-2008b" TYPE="STUDY">Lin 2008b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moseley-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Moseley 2005</LINK>), Ankle Function Assessment (modified from the Olerud Molander Ankle Score; <LINK REF="STD-Wilson-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Wilson 1991</LINK>), Inflammatory Score (<LINK REF="STD-Brink-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Brink 1996</LINK>), Maryland Foot Score (<LINK REF="STD-DiStasio-1994" TYPE="STUDY">DiStasio 1994</LINK>), visual analogue scale (<LINK REF="STD-Wetzler-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Wetzler 1991</LINK>) and scales by <LINK REF="REF-Mazur-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mazur 1979</LINK> (<LINK REF="STD-Egol-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Egol 2000</LINK>) and <LINK REF="REF-Kaikkonen-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kaikkonen 1994</LINK> (<LINK REF="STD-Venesmaa-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Venesmaa 2004</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Losch-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Losch 2002</LINK> assessed activity limitation with a dichotomous variable (ability to climb 12 steps independently, yes or no). Four studies used other scales as well as the Olerud Molander Ankle Score to measure activity limitation (<LINK REF="STD-Hedstrom-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Hedstrom 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lehtonen-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Lehtonen 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-van-Laarhoven-1996" TYPE="STUDY">van Laarhoven 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vioreanu-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Vioreanu 2007</LINK>): for example, the American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) scoring system (<LINK REF="STD-Vioreanu-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Vioreanu 2007</LINK>). For these studies we extracted data from the Olerud Molander Ankle Score as it is used more widely. With the exception of Clinical Demerit Points, a higher score on all questionnaires of activity limitation indicated less limitation.</P>
<P>Four studies used performance tests to measure activity limitation, and all of these studies used more than one test (<LINK REF="STD-Ginandes-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Ginandes 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lin-2008b" TYPE="STUDY">Lin 2008b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moseley-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Moseley 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nilsson-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Nilsson 2009</LINK>). Because walking was the only test that was used in all studies, data from the walking test were extracted. Walking was measured as distance walked (<LINK REF="STD-Ginandes-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Ginandes 1999</LINK>), walking speed (<LINK REF="STD-Lin-2008b" TYPE="STUDY">Lin 2008b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moseley-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Moseley 2005</LINK>) or walking time (<LINK REF="STD-Nilsson-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Nilsson 2009</LINK>). With the exception of walking time, a higher score indicated less limitation.

<P>Three of the five studies that measured activity limitation using a continuous outcome measure found some evidence that the use of a removable type of immobilisation and exercise conferred positive benefits (<LINK REF="STD-Egol-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Egol 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rasmussen-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Rasmussen 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vioreanu-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Vioreanu 2007</LINK>), whereas this was not the case for two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Lehtonen-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Lehtonen 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tropp-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Tropp 1995</LINK>), which did not find differences between groups.

One of the studies (<LINK REF="STD-Egol-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Egol 2000</LINK>) reported that the group which received a removable type of immobilisation and exercise had significantly higher quality of life scores in two subsets on the Short Form 36 (vitality and perceptions of general health). However, they did not specify the timing of this assessment. The other study (<LINK REF="STD-Vioreanu-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Vioreanu 2007</LINK>) reported no difference between groups in quality of life at the 24-week follow-up but no data were given.</P>
<P>Two studies reported pain outcomes. Using a removable type of immobilisation and exercise reduced pain at the end of treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Rasmussen-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Rasmussen 2000:</LINK> RR 0.12, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.44, <LINK REF="CMP-007.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 7.4</LINK>.3).

<P>All studies in this sub-category that measured dorsiflexion range of motion demonstrated that the use of a removable type of immobilisation and exercise was beneficial at the end of treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Lehtonen-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Lehtonen 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stockle-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Stockle 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tropp-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Tropp 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vioreanu-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Vioreanu 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-007.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 7.6</LINK>.3), but only two of six studies found a difference at the end of follow-up (<LINK REF="STD-Losch-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Losch 2002</LINK>, <LINK REF="CMP-007.07" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 7.7</LINK>.3; plus <LINK REF="STD-Davies-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Davies 1991</LINK>, <LINK REF="TBL-04" TYPE="TABLE">Table 4</LINK> outcome 3). Some of the studies measuring plantarflexion range of motion found a positive outcome for the use of a removable type of immobilisation and exercise at the end of treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Stockle-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Stockle 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vioreanu-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Vioreanu 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-007.08" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 7.8</LINK>.3) or follow-up (<LINK REF="STD-Losch-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Losch 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stockle-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Stockle 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-007.09" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 7.9</LINK>.3; plus <LINK REF="STD-Davies-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Davies 1991</LINK>, <LINK REF="TBL-04" TYPE="TABLE">Table 4</LINK> outcome 4). One study reported dorsiflexion and plantarflexion combined range of motion (<LINK REF="STD-Rasmussen-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Rasmussen 2000</LINK>), and showed a statistically significant improvement with the use of a removable type of immobilisation and exercise at the end of treatment (MD 30.00 degrees, 95% CI 17.42 to 42.58; <LINK REF="CMP-007.10" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 7.10</LINK>.3) but not at follow-up (<LINK REF="CMP-007.11" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 7.11</LINK>.3).</P>
<P>The only study reporting on strength (<LINK REF="STD-Tropp-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Tropp 1995</LINK>) found no difference between the two groups at 10 weeks (<LINK REF="CMP-007.12" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 7.12</LINK>.3) but a positive effect for exercise at one year (<LINK REF="CMP-007.13" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 7.13</LINK>.3). Pooled results for swelling (three studies) showed no significant between-group differences at any time point (<LINK REF="CMP-007.14" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 7.14</LINK>.3, <LINK REF="CMP-007.15" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 7.15</LINK>.3; <LINK REF="TBL-04" TYPE="TABLE">Table 4</LINK> outcome 5).</P>
<P>There was a statistically significant difference between groups in adverse events favouring the cast and no exercise group (pooled data from 7 studies: 49/201 versus 20/197; RR 2.30, 95% CI 1.49 to 3.56; <LINK REF="CMP-007.16" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 7.16</LINK>.3). Two studies could not be included in the meta-analysis because they reported the number of adverse events rather than the number of participants with adverse events (<LINK REF="STD-Hedstrom-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Hedstrom 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tropp-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Tropp 1995</LINK>). Both studies also found results favouring the cast and no exercise group. <LINK REF="STD-Hedstrom-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Hedstrom 1994</LINK> reported four cases of arthrosis and two cases of superficial wound infection in the removable type of immobilisation and exercise group, and one case of superficial wound infection in the cast and no exercise group. <LINK REF="STD-Tropp-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Tropp 1995</LINK> reported six cases of failure of the syndesmotic staple and one case of wound secretion in the removable type of immobilisation and exercise group, and one case of failure of the syndesmotic staple in the cast and no exercise group. Overall, the adverse events were mainly minor (e.g. problems with the surgical wound, changes in skin sensation) except for four cases of arthrosis (<LINK REF="STD-Hedstrom-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Hedstrom 1994</LINK>), seven cases of failure of the syndesmotic staple (<LINK REF="STD-Tropp-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Tropp 1995</LINK>), one loss of internation fixation and one re-fracture (<LINK REF="STD-Lehtonen-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Lehtonen 2003</LINK>), and one case of fixation failure (<LINK REF="STD-DiStasio-1994" TYPE="STUDY">DiStasio 1994</LINK>); all but one of these cases occurred in the removable type of immobilisation and exercise group.</P>

<P>Three of the studies that investigated rehabilitation interventions following the immobilisation period recruited a mix of participants with conservative or surgical orthopaedic management (<LINK REF="STD-Lin-2008b" TYPE="STUDY">Lin 2008b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moseley-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Moseley 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wilson-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Wilson 1991</LINK>).

Subgroup analyses on the primary outcome of activity limitation revealed (visual assessment) that stretching (<LINK REF="CMP-014.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 14.1</LINK> and <LINK REF="CMP-014.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 14.2</LINK>) or manual therapy (<LINK REF="CMP-014.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 14.3</LINK> and <LINK REF="CMP-014.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 14.4</LINK>), in addition to an exercise programme, conferred no additional benefit for participants regardless of the type of orthopaedic management.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Sensitivity analysis (Comparison 15)</HEADING>
<P>We were only able to pool studies in Comparison 6, 'Weight-bearing during immobilisation after surgical fixation', and in some of the outcomes in Comparison 4, 'Type of immobilisation after surgical fixation' (<LINK REF="CMP-004.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.1</LINK>.1) and Comparison 7, 'Exercise during immobilisation after surgical fixation' (<LINK REF="CMP-007.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 7.6</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-007.14" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 7.14</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-007.15" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 7.15</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-007.16" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 7.16</LINK>).

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-10-10 23:50:20 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Thirty-one randomised and seven quasi-randomised controlled trials were included. The results were limited as pooling was not possible in most instances due to the low number of studies in that comparison, or heterogeneity. Additionally, each risk of bias item had at least half of the studies scoring unclear or high. Around one quarter of the studies had incomplete or no reporting of adverse events.</P>
<P>For interventions administered during the immobilisation period after conservative orthopaedic management, there was limited indication that using an air-stirrup may be more effective than a cast (one study) or an orthosis (one study) in the short term, but the precision and size of the treatment effect are unclear. A small study (12 participants) provided no evidence that using hypnosis improved activity limitation or other outcomes.</P>
<P>Thirty studies investigated rehabilitation interventions during the immobilisation period after surgical fixation. Ten studies compared the use of a removable type of immobilisation combined with exercise with cast immobilisation alone. The intervention reduced activity limitation in five of eight studies reporting this outcome. There was also some evidence for reduced pain and improved ankle range of motion for this intervention. However, using a removable type of immobilisation and starting exercise during the immobilisation period after surgical fixation was also associated with increased adverse events, albeit mostly minor (e.g. wound infection). The ability of a patient to safely adhere to the regimen of removing immobilisation, performing exercise, and re-applying immobilisation is without doubt an important factor to be considered when applying this intervention in clinical practice.</P>
<P>Early commencement of weight-bearing (two studies) showed a positive, although generally minor, effect on ankle range of motion. A small study showed that using neurostimulation improved pain, ankle range of motion and swelling in the short term. But this study had a high risk of bias due to receiving funding from the device manufacturer. There was little and inconclusive evidence on what type of support or immobilisation was most effective. One study found no immobilisation improved ankle dorsiflexion and plantarflexion range of motion compared with cast immobilisation, but another showed using a backslab improved ankle dorsiflexion range of motion compared with using a bandage.</P>
<P>Five studies investigated different rehabilitation interventions following the immobilisation period after either conservative or surgical orthopaedic management. These showed that adding stretching or manual therapy to exercise, and exercise compared with usual care, did not improve outcomes after ankle fracture. This evidence is largely based on single studies. Evidence from one small study (14 participants) at a high risk of bias showed reduced ankle swelling after non-thermal compared with thermal pulsed shortwave diathermy.</P>
<P>Most of the studies included in our review compared one rehabilitation intervention versus another rehabilitation intervention or one type of immobilisation versus another type of immobilisation. For these studies, the results should not be interpreted as evidence of the lack of efficacy of the rehabilitation interventions presented. Interventions may be equally effective, or indeed equally ineffective, so that no difference could be detected between groups.</P>

<P>It is important to consider the clinical significance of the size of the treatment effect. Nine of the 24 studies that measured activity limitation, our primary outcome, showed statistically significant between-group differences, but only four provided enough data to assess of the size of the treatment effect (<LINK REF="STD-Egol-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Egol 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Losch-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Losch 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rasmussen-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Rasmussen 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vioreanu-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Vioreanu 2007</LINK>). All investigated exercise during the immobilisation period after surgical fixation (Comparison 7). Two studies used the Olerud Molander Ankle Score (<LINK REF="STD-Rasmussen-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Rasmussen 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vioreanu-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Vioreanu 2007</LINK>), a 100-point scale (<LINK REF="REF-Olerud-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Olerud 1984</LINK>), for which there are currently no data on the minimal clinically important change. Based on the scoring of the scale and relevant literature in low back and neck pain (<LINK REF="REF-Cleland-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cleland 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ostelo-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ostelo 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-van-der-Roer-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">van der Roer 2006</LINK>), we propose that an improvement of approximately 10 points on this scale could be considered clinically worthwhile. The treatment effect in <LINK REF="STD-Rasmussen-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Rasmussen 2000</LINK> was large and clinically worthwhile at the end of treatment (mean difference 47.30 points, 95% CI 37.86 to 56.74, <LINK REF="CMP-007.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 7.1</LINK>.3) and two-year follow-up (MD 8.50 points, 95% CI 3.77 to 13.23, <LINK REF="CMP-007.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 7.2</LINK>.3). <LINK REF="STD-Vioreanu-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Vioreanu 2007</LINK> also reported clinically significant findings at the end of follow-up (MD 12.10 points, 95% CI 7.51 to 16.69, <LINK REF="CMP-007.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 7.2</LINK>.3). In contrast, <LINK REF="STD-Egol-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Egol 2000</LINK> found a statistically significant, though unlikely clinically worthwhile, treatment effect at the end of the six-week treatment (MD 4.10 points out of 100 points on a grading system by <LINK REF="REF-Mazur-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mazur 1979</LINK>, 95% CI 0.63 to 7.57, <LINK REF="CMP-007.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 7.1</LINK>.3). <LINK REF="STD-Losch-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Losch 2002</LINK> used a dichotomous variable (<LINK REF="CMP-007.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 7.3</LINK>.3) and treatment details are not available for this study, so the findings can only provide preliminary evidence. Although these results are heterogeneous, they suggest that the use of a removable type of immobilisation and exercise may confer reductions in activity limitation that are clinically worthwhile. This needs to be balanced against possible adverse events and be strengthened with further research.</P>
<P>Improvements in impairment measures often failed to translate into gains in activity limitation. For example, statistically significant differences were seen in ankle range of motion when no immobilisation was compared to cast immobilisation (<LINK REF="STD-Siddique-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Siddique 2005;</LINK> <LINK REF="CMP-003.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.2</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-003.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.3</LINK>), and the use of a removable type of immobilisation and exercise was compared to a cast and no exercise (<LINK REF="STD-Lehtonen-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Lehtonen 2003;</LINK> <LINK REF="CMP-007.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 7.6</LINK>.3), but neither of these studies showed significant between-group differences in activity limitation (<LINK REF="CMP-003.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.1</LINK>.1; <LINK REF="CMP-007.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 7.1</LINK>.1). It is possible that changes in a few impairments are not significant enough to translate into changes in activity limitation. For example, the initial gains in range of motion may be important to allow activities of daily living, but gains towards the extremes of range may not significantly influence activity limitation, despite an improvement in the impairment score. Alternatively, the relevant mix of impairments may not have been measured, or the measures of activity limitation were not responsive to change.</P>
<P>Significant between-group differences at the end of the treatment period tended to reduce in magnitude (e.g. activity limitation in <LINK REF="STD-Rasmussen-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Rasmussen 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-007.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 7.1</LINK>.3; <LINK REF="CMP-007.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 7.2</LINK>.3) or cease to be significant (e.g. ankle dorsiflexion and plantarflexion combined range of motion in <LINK REF="STD-Rasmussen-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Rasmussen 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-007.10" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 7.10</LINK>.3; <LINK REF="CMP-007.11" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 7.11</LINK>.3) at the end of follow-up. This could be attributed to natural recovery in this patient population. A short-term treatment effect may still be worthwhile in a clinical situation, as it may enable patients to have an earlier return to activities or lead to reduced length of treatment.</P>

<P>The evidence presented in this review is limited as it is primarily based on individual studies with unclear risk of bias and therefore should be interpreted with caution. The median sample size is small and interpretation of the results of small studies may be compromised by the lack of power. A wide confidence interval in the results also affects the interpretation of the clinical significance. For example, <LINK REF="STD-Nilsson-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Nilsson 2009</LINK> failed to demonstrate a statistically significant difference between groups in activity limitation, but there was a tendency towards improved activity limitation in the treatment group (<LINK REF="CMP-012.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 12.1</LINK>) and the wide confidence interval cannot rule out a potentially clinically worthwhile benefit for exercise. Future trials need to be adequately powered so that the results can be conclusive and a type II error can be avoided.</P>
<P>The clinical and statistical heterogeneity among studies in each comparison prevented the pooling of most comparisons, which would have made the results more robust. In addition, a number of interventions were investigated by single studies. If future research could first focus on interventions that are in common use, such as weight-bearing and exercise starting during the immobilisation period, and exercise starting after the immobilisation period, it would allow more opportunities for pooling studies and provide evidence that is most pertinent to current clinical practice.</P>
<P>One small study (N = 60) which investigated non-invasive neurostimulation found benefits in pain, ankle range of motion and swelling compared to sham neurostimulation (<LINK REF="STD-Gorodetskyi-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Gorodetskyi 2010</LINK>). However this study had a high risk of other bias as it received funding from the manufacturer. Industry-funded trials tend to favour the product under investigation (<LINK REF="REF-Lexchin-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lexchin 2003</LINK>) which has been highlighted as a potential source of bias (<LINK REF="REF-Goodman-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goodman 2011</LINK>).</P>

<P>We are confident that we were exhaustive in our search strategy. We included only randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials as they are less susceptible to selection bias (<LINK REF="REF-Roberts-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roberts 1998</LINK>). In an effort to locate all relevant trials, sensitive searches were conducted across a comprehensive list of electronic databases as well as reference lists of the included studies. We also searched two Specialised Registers of The Cochrane Collaboration, each of which handsearch major journals in relevant areas. To identify grey literature, we performed citation tracking and searched for unpublished studies through internet clinical trials registers. But we may have missed trials that published only in conference proceedings.</P>
<P>This review is limited by the availability of data from the studies. Two studies met the inclusion criteria but had to be excluded due to the incompleteness of the study details and the reported data (<LINK REF="STD-Mittlmeier-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Mittlmeier 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stapert-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Stapert 1986</LINK>).

<P>Our results are consistent with two previous reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Smith-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smith 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Thomas-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thomas 2009</LINK>), which reported limited evidence supporting the early commencement of exercise during the immobilisation period in reducing activity limitation and improving ankle range of motion in the short term. Similar to our review, <LINK REF="REF-Thomas-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thomas 2009</LINK> also found that these benefits were accompanied by an increased risk of adverse events (wound infection). Our review adds to the evidence from these reviews by evaluating the effects of rehabilitation interventions other than exercise.</P>
<P>Compared with our original review (<LINK REF="REF-Lin-2008a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lin 2008a</LINK>), seven new studies were added: four studies investigated the type of immobilisation (<LINK REF="STD-Romero-Zepeda-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Romero Zepeda 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Venesmaa-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Venesmaa 2004</LINK>), weight-bearing and exercise (<LINK REF="STD-Franke-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Franke 2008</LINK>) and electrotherapy (<LINK REF="STD-Gorodetskyi-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Gorodetskyi 2010</LINK>) implemented during the immobilisation period after surgical fixation, and three studies investigated manual therapy (<LINK REF="STD-Lin-2008b" TYPE="STUDY">Lin 2008b</LINK>), exercise (<LINK REF="STD-Nilsson-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Nilsson 2009</LINK>) and electrotherapy (<LINK REF="STD-Seiger-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Seiger 2009</LINK>) implemented after the immobilisation period. Results on rehabilitation interventions implemented during the immobilisation period were largely the same as those presented in the original review (<LINK REF="REF-Lin-2008a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lin 2008a</LINK>), except for the limited evidence that neurostimulation improves pain, ankle range of motion and swelling from a single study partially funded by the device manufacturer (<LINK REF="STD-Gorodetskyi-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Gorodetskyi 2010</LINK>). In our original review, we found that manual therapy may improve ankle range of motion, based on one small study (<LINK REF="STD-Wilson-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Wilson 1991</LINK>). This finding is not supported in this current update. In addition, in this update we found single studies (hence weak evidence) reporting that exercise implemented after the immobilisation did not improve outcome compared to usual care (<LINK REF="STD-Nilsson-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Nilsson 2009</LINK>), but non-thermal compared with thermal shortwave diathermy may reduce swelling (<LINK REF="STD-Seiger-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Seiger 2009</LINK>).</P>

<P>Evidence provided by this review is limited by the clinical and statistical heterogeneity between studies, which prevented meta-analyses in most instances, the small number of available studies for some comparisons, and the unclear risk of bias overall. Evidence based on single studies, particularly when they are small, needs to be confirmed by well-designed and large-scale future trials.</P>
<P>For rehabilitation interventions administered during the immobilisation period after conservative orthopaedic management, there was insufficient evidence to determine the benefits of using an air-stirrup over a cast or orthosis, and limited evidence from one very small study that hypnosis was not effective.</P>
<P>For rehabilitation interventions implemented during the immobilisation period after surgical fixation, using a removable type of immobilisation to enable gentle exercise during the immobilisation period may reduce activity limitation and pain, and improve ankle range of motion after the treatment period and in the long term. But the incidence of adverse events, mainly problems with the surgical wound, may be increased. In addition, commencement of weight-bearing during the immobilisation period may improve ankle range of motion. Independent confirmation is required of the promising short-term benefits for neurostimulation found by one small study with a high risk of bias. There is no evidence of an effect for other electrotherapy modalities.</P>
<P>After the period of immobilisation there is no evidence of an effect for stretching, manual therapy or exercise. A small study showed that non-thermal compared with thermal shortwave diathermy may reduce swelling in the short term.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2012-10-09 15:56:02 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Evidence for the best management of people during the immobilisation period after conservative orthopaedic management, which is currently lacking, needs to be established. For rehabilitation interventions administered during the immobilisation period after surgical fixation, although some tentative conclusions can be drawn about the benefits of the early commencement of exercise or weight-bearing, more trials that are well-designed and adequately-powered are required to confirm these findings. This is also true for physical and manual therapies administered after the immobilisation period, where there is currently no strong evidence of effect, despite the common use of these therapies.</P>
<P>Our review shows that there is currently no ongoing study investigating rehabilitation interventions during the immobilisation period after conservative orthopaedic management. Four ongoing studies are investigating early commencement of exercise or weight-bearing during the immobilisation period after surgical fixation (<LINK REF="STD-ISRCTN33416471" TYPE="STUDY">ISRCTN33416471</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-ACTRN12610000557033" TYPE="STUDY">ACTRN12610000557033</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-NCT01127776" TYPE="STUDY">NCT01127776</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-N0055190984" TYPE="STUDY">N0055190984</LINK>), which will add to current evidence. One ongoing study is investigating the effects of structured exercise after the immobilisation period (<LINK REF="STD-Moseley" TYPE="STUDY">Moseley</LINK>).</P>
<P>Future research should first focus on interventions that are commonly used, such as weight-bearing and exercise during the immobilisation period and exercise after the immobilisation period. Better reporting of data is required in future studies, particularly in the reporting of the size of the treatment effect, so that researchers, clinicians and consumers can make better judgement on the clinical significance of the results. Also, the risk of bias needs to be kept low by providing clear information such as random sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding, data attrition and the outcomes measured.</P>

<P>There were the following differences between the protocol and this update:</P>
<P>
<B>1. Grouping of studies</B>
<BR/>The grouping of the included studies differs from that stated in the protocol, but follows the format of the original review (<LINK REF="REF-Lin-2008a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lin 2008a</LINK>). This change was made after considering the included studies and upon consultation with the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group.</P>
<P>
<B>2. Search methods</B>
<BR/>As stated in the update, we amended our original search strategies slightly with assistance from the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group due to changes in MeSH terms or keywords (for CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE and AMED) or the database platform (for CINAHL and SPORTDiscus). We used the new WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) to search for unpublished trials, which encompasses the clinical trial registers we planned to search as stated in the protocol.</P>
<P>
<B>3. Risk of bias assessment</B>
<BR/>In line with Collaboration policy, included trials were assessed using the 'Risk of bias' tool instead of the PEDro scale, and 'methodological quality' was replaced with 'risk of bias'.</P>

<B>4. Sensitivity analysis</B>
<BR/>The planned sensitivity analysis was based on four risk of bias features (true versus quasi-randomisation, concealed versus non-concealed allocation, blind versus non-blind outcome assessment and minimal (&lt; 15%) versus significant (&#8805; 15%) dropouts). Due to changes in the risk of bias tool used, this was amended to: random sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding and incomplete outcome data. In this update, studies rated as having a low risk of bias on these features were included in the sensitivity analysis.<BR/>
