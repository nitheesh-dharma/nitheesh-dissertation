<TITLE>Thrombolysis for treatment of acute deep vein thrombosis</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2016-11-07 10:17:20 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Background</P>
<P>Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) occurs when a blood clot forms in a leg vein. The clot can break up and move to the lungs, leading to a potentially serious blockage in blood flow (pulmonary embolism or PE). Because of the damage to the leg vein, post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS) may develop any time over the next couple of years. Symptoms include leg pain, swelling, skin pigmentation and leg ulcers, leading to loss of mobility. Anticoagulants are the standard treatment for DVT or a clot in a calf vein. These thin the blood to reduce further clots from forming and prevent PE; yet PTS can still develop. Thrombolysis breaks down the blood clot. For DVT, drugs such as streptokinase, urokinase and tissue plasminogen activator are infused into a vein in the arm or foot or, in some cases, directly at the site of the clot using a catheter and X-ray control. Bleeding complications, stroke or intracerebral haemorrhage are potential harmful events for both treatments.</P>
<P>Study characteristics and key results</P>
<P>The review results are based on 17 controlled trials that randomised a total of 1103 people with acute DVT (within 21 days of onset of symptoms) to receive thrombolysis or anticoagulant treatment. Trials were carried out principally in the USA, Scandinavia, Germany and the UK. All trials included men and women ranging in age from 18 to 75 years with a preponderance of older adults.</P>
<P>The present review (current until February 2016) showed that thrombolysis may have advantages over standard anticoagulation treatment. Thrombolysis effectively dissolved the clot so that complete clot breakdown occurred more often with thrombolysis than with standard anticoagulant therapy. Blood flow in the affected vein (venous patency) was also better maintained. Three trials (306 participants) continued for over six months and found that fewer people developed PTS when treated with thrombolysis, 45% compared with 66% in the standard anticoagulation treatment group. Two trials (211 participants) which continued for over five years also showed that fewer people developed PTS when treated with thrombolysis.</P>
<P>Those receiving thrombolysis had more bleeding complications than with standard anticoagulation (10% versus 8%). Most bleeding episodes and deaths occurred in the older studies. Use of strict eligibility criteria appears to have improved the safety of this treatment, which is effective delivered directly to the clot by catheter or via bloodstream from another vein.</P>
<P>Qualitity of the evidence</P>
<P>Using GRADE assessment, the evidence was judged to be of moderate quality due to many trials having low numbers of participants. However, the results across studies were consistent and we have reasonable confidence in these results.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2016-11-07 10:06:28 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Standard treatment for deep vein thrombosis aims to reduce immediate complications. Use of thrombolysis or clot dissolving drugs could reduce the long-term complications of post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS) including pain, swelling, skin discolouration, or venous ulceration in the affected leg. This is the third update of a review first published in 2004.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2016-11-07 10:06:29 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>To assess the effects of thrombolytic therapy and anticoagulation compared to anticoagulation alone for the management of people with acute deep vein thrombosis (DVT) of the lower limb as determined by the effects on pulmonary embolism, recurrent venous thromboembolism, major bleeding, post-thrombotic complications, venous patency and venous function.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2016-08-10 18:14:18 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Karen Welch">
<P>For this update the Cochrane Vascular Information Specialist (CIS) searched the Specialised Register (February 2016). In addition the CIS searched the Cochrane Register of Studies (CENTRAL (2016, Issue 1)). Trial registries were searched for details of ongoing or unpublished studies.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2013-12-05 11:28:20 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Cathryn  A Broderick">
<P>Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) examining thrombolysis and anticoagulation versus anticoagulation for acute DVT were considered.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2016-11-08 11:46:42 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Cathryn  Broderick">
<P>For this update (2016), LW and CB selected trials, extracted data independently, and sought advice from MPA where necessary. We assessed study quality with the Cochrane risk of bias tool. For dichotomous outcomes, we calculated the risk ratio (RR) and corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI). Data were pooled using a fixed-effect model unless significant heterogeneity was identified in which case a random-effects model was used. GRADE was used to assess the overall quality of the evidence supporting the outcomes assessed in this review.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-11-07 10:06:34 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Seventeen RCTs with 1103 participants were included. These studies differed in the both thrombolytic agent used and in the technique used to deliver it. Systemic, loco-regional and catheter-directed thrombolysis (CDT) were all included. Fourteen studies were rated as low risk of bias and three studies were rated as high risk of bias. We combined the results as any (all) thrombolysis compared to standard anticoagulation. Complete clot lysis occurred significantly more often in the treatment group at early follow-up (RR 4.91; 95% CI 1.66 to 14.53, P = 0.004) and at intermediate follow-up (RR 2.44; 95% CI 1.40 to 4.27, P = 0.002; moderate quality evidence). A similar effect was seen for any degree of improvement in venous patency. Up to five years after treatment significantly less PTS occurred in those receiving thrombolysis (RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.53 to 0.81; P &lt; 0.0001; moderate quality evidence). This reduction in PTS was still observed at late follow-up (beyond five years), in two studies (RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.77; P &lt; 0.0001; moderate quality evidence). Leg ulceration was reduced although the data were limited by small numbers (RR 0.87; 95% CI 0.16 to 4.73, P = 0.87). Those receiving thrombolysis had increased bleeding complications (RR 2.23; 95% CI 1.41 to 3.52, P = 0.0006; moderate quality evidence). Three strokes occurred in the treatment group, all in trials conducted pre-1990, and none in the control group. There was no significant effect on mortality detected at either early or intermediate follow-up. Data on the occurrence of pulmonary embolism (PE) and recurrent DVT were inconclusive. Systemic thrombolysis and CDT had similar levels of effectiveness. Studies of CDT included two trials in femoral and iliofemoral DVT, and results from these are consistent with those from trials of systemic thrombolysis in DVT at other levels of occlusion.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2016-11-07 10:06:36 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Thrombolysis increases the patency of veins and reduces the incidence of PTS following proximal DVT by a third. Evidence suggests that systemic administration and CDT have similar effectiveness. Strict eligibility criteria appears to improve safety in recent studies and may be necessary to reduce the risk of bleeding complications. This may limit the applicability of this treatment. In those who are treated there is a small increased risk of bleeding. Using GRADE assessment, the evidence was judged to be of moderate quality due to many trials having low numbers of participants. However, the results across studies were consistent and we have reasonable confidence in these results.</P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2016-11-09 12:35:02 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Cathryn  Broderick">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2016-11-07 10:06:38 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is a major health problem with between 2.5% to 5% of the population affected at some time in their lives (<LINK REF="REF-Browse-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Browse 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-White-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">White 2006</LINK>). Its main complications are pulmonary embolism (PE) in the short term and post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS) in the long term. Standard treatment is with anticoagulation (thinning the blood to reduce formation of further clots) and is aimed mainly at the prevention of PE and recurrent DVT (<LINK REF="REF-Kearon-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kearon 2016</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NICE-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2012</LINK>). Despite treatment, over 50% of patients may suffer post-thrombotic symptoms in the long term, manifested by some degree of pain, swelling, skin pigmentation or venous ulceration of the affected leg (<LINK REF="REF-Kahn-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kahn 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schulman-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulman 2006</LINK>). This usually becomes apparent in the first two years after the thrombotic event (<LINK REF="REF-Brandjes-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brandjes 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kahn-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kahn 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kahn-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kahn 2008</LINK>). Most studies report eventual venous ulceration in at least 6% of DVT patients despite treatment with compression bandaging (<LINK REF="REF-Johnson-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnson 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schulman-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulman 2006</LINK>). The prevalence of venous ulcers in the general population is around 1 in 1000, and between 40% to 50% of patients with venous ulcers have evidence of post-thrombotic damage (<LINK REF="REF-Browse-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Browse 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kahn-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kahn 2004</LINK>). Complications including venous ulcers may result in significant disability and may be difficult to manage in both the community and secondary care. Because complications develop after hospital admission, there is a low level of awareness of these complications amongst the clinicians who dealt with the acute admission.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2014-01-11 06:55:46 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Thrombolytic drugs act to dissolve blood clots by activating plasminogen. This forms an enzyme called plasmin that breaks links between the fibrin molecules, which make up blood clots. The drugs can be administered systemically through a peripheral vein, loco-regionally via a vein close to the clot or directly via a catheter to the occluding thrombus. The latter method more directly targets plasminogen within the clot and is less affected by potential inhibitors in the circulation.</P>

<THEORY MODIFIED="2016-10-05 11:51:49 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Dissolving the thrombus in the acute phase may reduce the risk of more permanent damage to the structure and function of the vein, in particular venous valvular function, thus lowering the risk of post-thrombotic complications in the long term. </P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Summary of findings</HEADING>
<P>We created 'Summary of findings' tables using the <A HREF="http://gradepro.org/">GRADEpro</A> software. This summarised the evidence comparing thrombolysis to standard anticoagulation for study populations consisting of patients with acute DVT (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>); and comparing CDT versus standard anticoagulation for DVT (<LINK REF="SOF-02" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 2</LINK>). The most important and clinically relevant outcomes (both desirable and undesirable) that were thought to be essential for decision-making were the outcomes complete clot lysis, bleeding and post-thrombotic syndrome. Assumed control intervention risks were calculated by the mean number of events in the control groups of the selected studies for each outcome. The system developed by the Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation Working Group (GRADE working group) was used for grading the quality of evidence as high, moderate, low and very low, based on within-study risk of bias, inconsistency, directness of evidence, imprecision, and publication bias (<LINK REF="REF-Atkins-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Atkins 2004</LINK>).</P>

Studies were carried out from 1969 to 2009. A cut-off of 21 days from onset of symptoms was used, therefore a small number of studies excluded on this basis from the original review were included.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Participants</HEADING>
<P>Trials were carried out principally in the USA, Scandinavia, Germany and the UK. All trials included men and women and the age range was 18 to 75 years with a preponderance of older adults. The participants had diverse underlying causes for developing DVT, and varying degrees of level and extent of occlusion. The trial by <LINK REF="STD-Elsharawy-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Elsharawy 2002</LINK> was conducted in DVT affecting femoral and iliofemoral veins and <LINK REF="STD-Enden-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Enden 2011</LINK> included pelvic, femoral and iliofemoral veins, whereas other trials included thrombosis affecting different combinations of levels, including popliteal. The only study to include calf vein thrombosis only was <LINK REF="STD-Schulman-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Schulman 1986</LINK>. See <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>, 'Level of affected leg veins in included studies'.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Inclusion criteria</HEADING>
<P>Inclusion criteria have become more restrictive over time. In the earliest study by <LINK REF="STD-Kakkar-1969" TYPE="STUDY">Kakkar 1969</LINK>, there were only four contra-indications: surgery within three days, an unhealed wound, peptic ulcer and hypertension. By the time of <LINK REF="STD-Schweizer-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Schweizer 2000</LINK>, a more comprehensive list of contra-indications had been developed including: surgery or head trauma within the previous three months, malignancy, renal and hepatic dysfunction, and bleeding dysfunction, which in later studies reduces the proportion of eligible participants.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Interventions</HEADING>
<P>Interventions included systemic, loco-regional and CDT. Systemic and loco-regional techniques differ only in the veins used to deliver an infusion: the arm or foot respectively. CDT is a more invasive procedure in which a catheter is inserted into the popliteal vein behind the knee using X-ray control. The thrombolytic agent is infused through the catheter into the blood clot itself and the position of the catheter is altered according to the progress made in lysing the blood clot. The majority of trials assessed systemic thrombolysis, with streptokinase the most common agent used. The dose used varied: <LINK REF="STD-Schulman-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Schulman 1986</LINK> used a low-dose regime of systemic streptokinase, <LINK REF="STD-Tsapogas-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Tsapogas 1973</LINK> used loco-regional streptokinase and <LINK REF="STD-Elsharawy-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Elsharawy 2002</LINK> used catheter-directed streptokinase with frequent radiological assessment, a technique used again in <LINK REF="STD-Enden-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Enden 2011</LINK>.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Goldhaber-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Goldhaber 1990</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Turpie-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Turpie 1990</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Verhaeghe-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Verhaeghe 1989</LINK> used systemic tPA. While doses of tPA varied, there was no obvious cut-off for high or low doses. <LINK REF="STD-Goldhaber-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Goldhaber 1996</LINK> randomised two regimes of tPA, with and without heparin, compared to heparin alone. The two treatment arms were combined for the purposes of this review. <LINK REF="STD-Schweizer-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Schweizer 1998</LINK> had two treatment arms, loco-regional tPA and urokinase; and <LINK REF="STD-Schweizer-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Schweizer 2000</LINK> had four treatment arms: systemic streptokinase, systemic urokinase, loco-regional urokinase and loco-regional tPA. <LINK REF="STD-Kiil-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Kiil 1981</LINK> used low-dose systemic urokinase. </P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Co-treatments</HEADING>
<P>Monitoring regimes for heparinisation varied, and length of anticoagulation after the initial phase may be limited to a few months or continued for over a year. In some trials, especially the more recent ones, the use of compression bandages and elevation were reported; and for longer follow-up, some participants were required to use compression stockings with rigorous ascertainment of compliance with the continued treatment.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Size</HEADING>
<P>Nine studies had less than 50 participants (<LINK REF="STD-Arneson-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Arneson 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Elsharawy-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Elsharawy 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Goldhaber-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Goldhaber 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kakkar-1969" TYPE="STUDY">Kakkar 1969</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kiil-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Kiil 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Marder-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Marder 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schulman-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Schulman 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tsapogas-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Tsapogas 1973</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Verhaeghe-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Verhaeghe 1989</LINK>), and two studies had more than 100 participants (<LINK REF="STD-Enden-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Enden 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schweizer-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Schweizer 2000</LINK>). Most studies therefore lacked power to detect statistically significant effects. A power calculation was described in three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Elsharawy-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Elsharawy 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Enden-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Enden 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schweizer-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Schweizer 2000</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Schweizer-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Schweizer 2000</LINK> was the largest trial with 250 participants.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Outcomes</HEADING>
<P>One trial (<LINK REF="STD-Verhaeghe-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Verhaeghe 1989</LINK>), reported results for randomised participants together with non-randomised participants. Some studies reported outcomes using scales which could not be combined (<LINK REF="STD-Marder-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Marder 1977</LINK>). Removal of the clot was reported using various categorisations. Both complete clot dissolution or lysis, indicating that the venous patency was 100% restored, and any degree of venographic improvement in patency were reported in this review in order to capture as much information as possible. <LINK REF="STD-Tsapogas-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Tsapogas 1973</LINK> reported partial or complete clearance (75% to 100%), a measure not used in any other study, and others reported partial clearance (50% to 100%). One study reported on Qol and cost comparisons (<LINK REF="STD-Enden-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Enden 2011</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Length of follow-up</HEADING>
<P>All trials assessed outcomes in the period immediately after treatment. This was usually at one week, although the range was 36 hours to one month. We collectively grouped these as early outcomes. Intermediate outcomes have been classified as those determined after six months and under 5 years. No data were reported between this early and intermediate phase (i.e. after one month and before six months). Late outcomes were those reported 5 years or more after the intervention. PTS was assessed between one and six years. The longest follow-up (six years) was in the <LINK REF="STD-Arneson-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Arneson 1978</LINK> study. For this update (2016), late data (five year follow-up) from <LINK REF="STD-Enden-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Enden 2011</LINK> has been included.</P>

Blinding participants would be more difficult with more interventional approaches. However, this lack of blinding of participants may have introduced bias in the longer term as participants in receipt of thrombolysis may be more likely to have impressed upon them, or to heed advice given on, the importance of complying with co-treatments such as compression stockings. For example, compliance was higher in the treatment group in <LINK REF="STD-Enden-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Enden 2011</LINK>.

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-11-07 10:08:25 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The rationale for the use of thrombolysis for DVT is to prevent long-term complications related to poor venus function including PTS and ulceration. For this update it is encouraging that further data on intermediate to longer-term outcomes are available to assess these complications. Sixty-six per cent of control participants at intermediate time points and sixty-seven per cent at late follow-up experienced PTS, which is in line with other estimates. Pooling all types of thrombolysis, the results showed a reduction in the risk of PTS with use of thrombolysis by 34% at the intermediate time point (RR 0.66; NNTB 5) and a reduction in the risk of PTS of 42% at late follow-up (RR 0.58; NNTB 4). There was no difference in ulceration beyond six months; data were limited by small numbers and the short length of follow-up, as ulcers are more likely to occur later than a year or two after the DVT.</P>
<P>CDT has been studied at the femoral and iliofemoral levels only, where the risk of post-thrombotic complications is highest. Comparison four shows the results for the two recent trials which studied this method, which are comparable to the results for all routes of thrombolysis combined.</P>
<P>There were not enough data in this review to make any definitive comparison between the different agents or routes of administration for thrombolysis. Streptokinase appears to have been most widely studied. Significant results were obtained by combining studies including participants with DVT at a variety of levels of the leg veins affected, while it is accepted that the likelihood of later complications is less with clots at lower levels (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>).</P>
<P>The most marked effects with thrombolysis were seen in improvement in vein patency and complete clot lysis measured by venography, where both early and intermediate results showed important differences between the control and treatment groups. The use of objective classification of the degree of lysis would assist, in the future, with quantifying this outcome and the patency of the veins. There were not enough data to comment further on venous function or recurrent DVT per se. Results relating to PE were inconclusive due to uncertainty surrounding diagnosis.</P>
<P>The risk of inducing unwanted bleeding with thrombolytics has been the most important factor limiting its use for patients with DVT. Most bleeding episodes and deaths occurred in the earlier studies. Bleeding episodes (excluding stroke) causing interruption of therapy, interventions such as transfusion, or chronic sequelae (a condition following as a consequence of a disease) occurred more often with thrombolysis than with standard anticoagulation (RR 2.23; NNTH 17). There is no strong evidence that one particular route of administration or agent was excessively hazardous in this respect, although it is notable that no bleeding occurred in the <LINK REF="STD-Elsharawy-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Elsharawy 2002</LINK> study. This may have been due to strict exclusion criteria and the close radiological monitoring and dose titration depending upon clot lysis. A high proportion of patients with DVT are, however, unsuitable for thrombolytic treatment because of extensive contra-indications.</P>
<P>Three intracerebral bleeds occurred in these trials (<LINK REF="STD-Common-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Common 1976</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Goldhaber-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Goldhaber 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Marder-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Marder 1977</LINK>). Adoption of current contra-indications may have prevented these events in more recent trials. A stroke occurred in a participant with polycythaemia rubra vera who received streptokinase (<LINK REF="STD-Common-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Common 1976</LINK>), an intracranial bleed in a participant with controlled hypertension treated with tPA(<LINK REF="STD-Goldhaber-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Goldhaber 1990</LINK>), and a fatal intracranial haemorrhage in a patient with a remote history of cerebrovascular accident (<LINK REF="STD-Marder-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Marder 1977</LINK>). Two of the early deaths in the treatment groups may also have been prevented with the use of current contra-indications to thrombolysis: a participant with metastatic carcinoma (<LINK REF="STD-Common-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Common 1976</LINK>), and a participant with recent surgery (<LINK REF="STD-Kakkar-1969" TYPE="STUDY">Kakkar 1969</LINK>). Other deaths were incidental to the treatment or related to underlying conditions.</P>
<P>The data on intermediate mortality were inconclusive. One trial (<LINK REF="STD-Schweizer-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Schweizer 2000</LINK>) reported the absence of further PE episodes at one year, however no other trials reported on this outcome. Other adverse effects, for example allergic or anaphylactic reactions, were not examined in this review.</P>
<P>No comparisons between thrombolysis and subcutaneous low molecular weight heparin, administered at home, for DVT were identified.</P>
<P>One study <LINK REF="STD-Enden-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Enden 2011</LINK> examined both QoL and cost effectiveness. For QoL there was no significant difference between CDT and standard treatment although PTS was associated with a lower QoL. The incremental cost effectiveness ratio was USD 20,429 per QALY gained (<LINK REF="REF-Enden-2013b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Enden 2013b</LINK>). This incremental cost effectiveness ratio for CDT is within the range for approval by bodies making recommendation for implementation (<LINK REF="REF-Dakin-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dakin 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NICE-PMG9" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE PMG9</LINK>).</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2016-10-05 10:27:14 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The evidence presented is highly relevant to determining the effect of thrombolysis for DVT. The effectiveness of newer catheter-directed methods appears to be similar to systemic administration. Evidence suggests effectiveness at levels not limited to iliofemoral. As there is a degree of consistency in the results of trials over time, and in different settings, it is likely that the findings have external validity. Further evidence is desirable to confirm the effect of newer methods, and the factors predicting more successful outcomes. In future a combination of invasive procedures to remove the clot, with or without thrombolysis, may increase the proportion of patients who have effective clot removal; but that was out of the scope of this review. With respect to standard treatment with anticoagulation, selected patients may benefit from additional thrombolysis directed by catheter, or systemic if this were considered safe. This is in keeping with the current 'Recommendations and link to evidence' from NICE guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-guidelines-CG144" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE guidelines CG144</LINK>). There are implications for inpatient treatment, where anticoagulation for DVT is now delivered in outpatient settings, and for the resourcing of more invasive procedures.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2016-11-09 12:30:18 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Cathryn  Broderick">
<P>This evidence is based on 17 trials involving 1103 participants from a range of countries and settings. The key limitation of the studies is the paucity of long-term follow-up data greater than one year. The methodological quality of the studies was mostly high, and the results were consistent across a range of settings and patient groups. Using GRADE assessment, the body of evidence relating to complete clot lysis (intermediate), bleeding (early) and PTS (intermediate and late) was judged to be of moderate quality due to many trials having low numbers of participants (See <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>; <LINK REF="SOF-02" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 2</LINK>). There were obvious differences between the inclusion criteria and the conduct of studies completed over 40 years ago compared to more recent studies. However, the results across studies were consistent and we have reasonable confidence in the results.</P>

<P>It is likely that all relevant studies were identified and included. Relevant data were requested or obtained from study authors, although for older studies this was less likely to be successful.

<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2016-11-07 10:08:36 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The evidence presented here is consistent with findings of other reviews, which have included a broader range of evidence than RCTs. A review of the literature by <LINK REF="REF-Patterson-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Patterson 2010</LINK> concluded that in carefully selected patients CDT offered benefits in treatment, although further trial evidence was needed. <LINK REF="REF-Vedantham-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vedantham 2010</LINK> indicated benefits in CDT for people with extensive acute iliofemoral DVT, low expected bleeding risk and good functional status, although <LINK REF="REF-Comerota-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Comerota 2008</LINK> also emphasised a need for further research. A meta-analysis by <LINK REF="REF-Du-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Du 2015</LINK> included both randomised and non-randomised studies and had similar findings. Systemic thrombolysis is not current practice although this review suggests that it has similar effectiveness to CDT.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2016-11-07 10:08:39 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Thrombolysis offers potential advantages over standard treatment for DVT, by reducing the proportion of patients with chronic disabling leg symptoms from PTS by a third up to and beyond five years from treatment. This finding is based on four trials with a total of 341 participants, most of which have low risk of bias. There was an increased risk of iatrogenic (resulting from medical treatment or procedures) bleeding, but this risk has decreased over time with the use of stricter exclusion criteria for thrombolysis.</P>
<P>Results from systemic thrombolysis and CDT appear similar. Evidence suggests effectiveness for DVT above the level of the calf. Patients with extensive thromboses, for example iliofemoral, may have the most to gain in terms of preserving venous function, and patient selection is important to reduce the risk of complications. It was not possible to determine the optimum treatment regime in terms of agent, dose and route of administration from this review. Cost analysis from one study suggests that the incremental cost effectiveness ratio for CDT is within the range for approval by bodies making recommendation for implementation.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2016-11-07 10:08:39 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Future trials need to be large enough to detect significant clinical outcomes and ideally last two to five years to estimate the long-term effect of thrombolysis. CDT differs significantly, as a technique, from systemic thrombolysis and further investigation is needed using this method, particularly in the long term. It may worth be re-visiting whether systemic thrombolysis can be used safely in the modern era with careful patient selection. There are also resource implications to introducing systemic or CDT in selected patients due to the need for availability of skilled staff and interventional resources. Access to such treatment where outpatient management of DVT is undertaken may require service changes and these factors will require appropriate consideration in health economic studies which assess costs and cost effectiveness.</P>
<P>Use of thrombolysis in combination with interventional methods of clot removal may offer benefit to a wider group of patients, and the effect of temporary inferior vena cava filtration within this is an area for study. Newer agents that cause less systemic bleeding may hold promise for this condition.</P>
<P>It may be useful to differentiate the effects of PTS and thrombolysis on younger and older patients, the specific level of the clot, and differing times from the initial event, for example 14 days or 21 days or sooner from symptom onset. The measurement and quantification of lysis and the resulting patency of the vein is an area for further study. Exclusions, such as malignancy, warrant further study as these may become less significant in certain circumstances with safer methods of treatment. One of the studies performed a cost analysis and examined quality of life issues, but these too need further research.</P>

After lytic therapy, further intervention (PTA/stenting) will be performed if there is an underlying venous stenosis of 50% or more. Stent placement will be done with appropriate selected stents (self-expanding stainless steel wall stents). All stented patients will be given warfarin indefinitely (INR 2 &#8211; 3). Lysis will be considered complete if there is less than 5% residual thrombus</P>
<P>Control: conventional treatment will consist of intravenous heparin followed by warfarin. All patients will be treated with limb elevation and moist heat during their initial admission and maintained on prescription gradient compression stockings</P>

<P>The primary efficacy outcome is the incidence of PTS at one year; a decline in PTS incidence from 25% to 8% is anticipated. The secondary outcome is the Health related Quality of life and late PTS during follow-up. The principal safety outcome is major bleeding during anticoagulant therapy. Bleeding as well as events of recurrent thrombosis will be monitored. The patency of the venous system of the affected lower limb will be assessed as well as the percentage of clot lysis, after thrombolytic intervention. Additionally, measurements of markers of coagulation and inflammation will be performed during follow-up</P>
