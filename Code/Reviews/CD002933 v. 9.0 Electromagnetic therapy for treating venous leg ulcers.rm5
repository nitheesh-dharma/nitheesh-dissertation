<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2015-06-11 13:28:21 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nicky Cullum">
<P>Venous leg ulcers (which appear as open sores) can be caused by a blockage or breakdown in the veins of the legs. Compression of the leg, using bandages or hosiery (stockings), can help heal most of these ulcers. Electromagnetic therapy is also sometimes offered. Electromagnetic therapy is not a form of radiation or heat, but uses an electromagnetic field to try to promote healing. This review of clinical trials concluded that there is no high quality evidence about whether electromagnetic therapy speeds the healing of venous leg ulcers and its effect is unclear.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-06-11 13:26:44 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nicky Cullum">
<P>Three randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of low or unclear risk of bias, involving 94 people, were included in the original review; subsequent updates have identified no new trials. All the trials compared the use of EMT with sham-EMT. Meta-analysis of these trials was not possible due to heterogeneity. In the two trials that reported healing rates; one small trial (44 participants) reported that significantly more ulcers healed in the EMT group than the sham-EMT group however this result was not robust to different assumptions about the outcomes of participants who were lost to follow up. The second trial that reported numbers of ulcers healed found no significant difference in healing. The third trial was also small (31 participants) and reported significantly greater reductions in ulcer size in the EMT group however this result may have been influenced by differences in the prognostic profiles of the treatment groups.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2013-01-03 12:02:44 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2013-01-03 12:02:44 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>A leg ulcer is a common, chronic, recurring condition defined as the "loss of skin below the knee on the leg or foot, which takes more than six weeks to heal" (<LINK REF="REF-NHS-CRD-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">NHS CRD 1997</LINK>). The estimated prevalence of leg ulcers within the UK population is 1.5 to 3 per 1000; however, prevalence increases with age, mounting to 20 per 1000 in people over 80 years old (<LINK REF="REF-NHS-CRD-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">NHS CRD 1997</LINK>), and is higher amongst women (<LINK REF="REF-Callam-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Callam 1986</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-Callam-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Callam 1986</LINK> reported that 45% of people with leg ulcers in a Scottish study experienced episodes of ulceration for more than 10 years. Leg ulcers constitute a considerable cost to both the patient (<LINK REF="REF-Charles-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Charles 1995</LINK>) and the health service (<LINK REF="REF-Bosanquet-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bosanquet 1992</LINK>). Indeed, the economic cost of leg ulcers to the National Health Service (NHS) in the UK has been estimated at £400 million a year (<LINK REF="REF-Simon-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Simon 2004</LINK>). Venous ulcers (also known as stasis or varicose ulcers) constitute 80% to 85% of all leg ulcers (<LINK REF="REF-Simon-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Simon 2004</LINK>). These are caused by venous insufficiency which has been shown to be associated with increased hydrostatic pressure in the veins of the leg. The application of external compression reverses this and generally leads to the healing of the ulcers (<LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Meara-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Meara 2012</LINK>). However, a significant proportion of ulcers do not heal with compression therapy and additional treatments are used for this group of people.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2011-02-08 14:46:17 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Recently, there has been an increasing interest in the therapeutic use of electromagnetic fields for various medical conditions, including venous leg ulcers (<LINK REF="REF-Markov-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Markov 2007</LINK>). Electromagnetic therapy (EMT), also known as electromagnetism, bioelectricity, magneto biology, magnetic healing and magnetic field therapy, uses electromagnetic energy applied to the body to treat various medical conditions, from bone and cartilage repair (<LINK REF="REF-Haddad-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haddad 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ryaby-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ryaby 1998</LINK>) to pain relief (<LINK REF="REF-Shupak-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shupak 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Thomas-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thomas 2007</LINK>), wound healing (<LINK REF="STD-Kenkre-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Kenkre 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stiller-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Stiller 1992</LINK>), and relatively new applications such as chronic musculoskeletal pain (<LINK REF="REF-Thomas-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thomas 2007</LINK>). EMT does not use direct electrical effects or radiation, unlike other forms of electrotherapy, but induces a field effect (<LINK REF="STD-Stiller-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Stiller 1992</LINK>). A number of devices have been constructed to deliver either a continuous or a pulsed electromagnetic field (PEMF). PEMFs are produced with an 'on-off' effect of pulsing current to produce field effects, which, it has been suggested, may influence tissue generation and cell proliferation, and thus may be useful for wound healing. The main advantage of PEMF compared with continuous fields is that the short duration of the pulses protects the tissues against potential damage from heat generated by continuous fields (<LINK REF="REF-Athanasiou-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Athanasiou 2007</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2010-12-16 14:55:41 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There are several theories that explain how the PEMF may exert its effect on tissue generation and cell proliferation in wound healing. <LINK REF="REF-Lee-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lee 1993</LINK> suggested that PEMF might facilitate the migration of electrically-charged cells involved in repairing the wound area, thereby restoring the metabolic conditions of the healing cells. It has also been proposed that PEMF induces a tiny electrical signal on the injured cell membrane, which initiates a series of physiological effects that include an increase in the number of macrophages and fibroblasts present in the wound, a reduction of the inflammation, and an increased deposition of collagen and fibrin, all of which contribute to the healing process (<LINK REF="REF-Markoll-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Markoll 2003</LINK>). Other theories suggest that PEMF is associated with the production of free radicals within cells, which mediate intracellular communication (<LINK REF="REF-Gordon-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gordon 2007</LINK>). PEMF may exert several biological processes involved in wound healing but the exact mechanism is not clear.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2010-04-01 10:42:01 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The lack of response to standard therapies for chronic leg ulcers gives impetus to this review. There are also several anecdotal reports of the beneficial effects of EMT for chronic skin wounds, despite the lack of standardisation of the PEMF devices in terms of type, duration, frequency, intensity and length of exposure. A systematic review to assess the available evidence for EMT on venous leg ulcers is therefore merited.</P>

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2013-01-03 11:58:21 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>For this review two review authors independently assessed each included study using the Cochrane Collaboration tool for assessing risk of bias (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). This tool addresses six specific domains, namely sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding, incomplete outcome data, selective outcome reporting and other issues (e.g. extreme baseline imbalance) (see <LINK REF="APP-05" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 5</LINK> for details of the criteria on which the judgement was based). We assessed blinding and completeness of outcome data for each outcome separately. We completed a 'Risk of bias' table for each eligible study and discussed any disagreement amongst all review authors to achieve a consensus.</P>
<P>We explicitly judged each of these criteria using the following system: 'Yes' (i.e. low risk of bias); 'No' (i.e. high risk of bias); and 'Unclear' (i.e. either lack of information or uncertainty over the potential for bias). We presented an assessment of risk of bias using a 'Risk of bias' summary figure, which shows all the judgements in a cross-tabulation of study by entry (<LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>; <LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>).</P>

<DATA_SYNTHESIS MODIFIED="2011-02-08 16:11:40 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We presented all results quantitatively where possible, and in a narrative summary where there were insufficient data. For each trial with dichotomous outcomes (e.g. were ulcers healed? (yes or no)), we calculated a risk ratio (RR) of healing with 95% confidence intervals. Where outcomes for continuous variables were presented without confidence intervals, standard deviations, or some measure of the precision of the result, we entered the data into the <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK> and did not use them in data pooling.</P>

<INCLUDED_STUDIES_DESCR MODIFIED="2011-02-08 17:24:14 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included three studies of EMT in the review (<LINK REF="STD-Ieran-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Ieran 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kenkre-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Kenkre 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stiller-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Stiller 1992</LINK>). All studies compared the use of EMT with sham-EMT. They were small, with sample sizes ranging from 19 to 44. All participants were considered to have venous leg ulcers, although none of the studies reported how assessments were conducted.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Ieran-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Ieran 1990</LINK> recruited 44 people with venous leg ulcers to a double-blind RCT conducted in Italy. Participants were randomised to receive either EMT (75 Hz, 2.7 mT, with an impulse width 1.3 ms; n = 22) for four hours per day or sham stimulation for the same period of time (n = 22). Patients carried out the stimulation at home. No compression therapy was administered. Oral and local antibiotic therapy was given concomitantly to both groups. The study ran for a three-month period. The outcome measured was the percentage of ulcers healed and the size of wound area at three months.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Kenkre-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Kenkre 1996</LINK> examined the treatment of venous leg ulcers with EMT in a randomised, controlled, double-blind trial based in a leg ulcer clinic in an urban general practice in Birmingham, UK. Nineteen people were randomly allocated into three arms: the first treatment group received 600 Hz electric field, and 25 mT magnetic field, delivered by an Elmedistraal device (which generates perpendicular electric and magnetic fields). The second group received 600 Hz on days one to five, and 800 Hz on days six to 30 from a 25 mT magnetic field, delivered by an Elmedistraal device, for 30 minutes, five days a week for a total of 30 days followed by four weeks' observation. The control group received sham therapy. All participants had ulcer dressings changed by community staff, although there was no standardisation of dressings. All patients were reported to be receiving compression therapy; the authors reported that only two people received "adequate" compression. The primary outcome was the percentage of ulcers healed and changes in the ulcer area at day 50. Healing was based on clinical assessment scores which assessed changes in wound area.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Stiller-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Stiller 1992</LINK> randomised 31 people into a multi-centre, double-blind, sham-controlled trial in the USA. Eighteen people randomised to the active treatment group received the following: pulsed EMT (0.06 mV/cm, with a signal which was a three-part pulse [+, -, +] of 3.5 ms total width and a duty cycle of 25%), delivered by a Pulsed Electromagnetic Limb Ulcer Therapy (PELUT) device for three hours a day, plus standard treatment (ancillary topical treatment). Thirteen people were randomised to receive sham-EMT and standard treatment. The groups were treated over an eight-week period, or until the ulcer healed, whichever came first. Treatment continued for 12 weeks for patients who showed a favourable response at eight weeks. Standard treatment consisted of compression bandaging, leg elevation and the use of one of five named dressings. The outcomes measured were percentage change in wound area, mean decrease in wound depth, percentage change in area of granulation tissue, and percentage of ulcers healed or markedly improved at week eight. Wound healing was based on the investigators' clinical global assessment of the healing status which considered wound area, ulcer depth, appearance of granulation and pain. The percentage of ulcers either healed or showing marked improvement was combined and not presented separately in the study report.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Number of wounds healed at 90 days</HEADING>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Ieran-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Ieran 1990</LINK> reported that three people in the sham-EMT group (3/22, 14%) and four in the EMT group (4/22, 18%) were lost to follow up. Therefore, 19 people in the sham group and 18 in the EMT group were included in the complete case analysis. Assessment at 90 days found that 12/18 (67%) ulcers had healed in the EMT group compared with 6/19 (32%) in the sham group (RR 2.11; 95% CI 1.01 to 4.42) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>). The difference between the groups was marginally statistically significant in favour of EMT (P = 0.05), however, this is a small study which did not conduct an intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis and had missing data in each arm. This study was at low to moderate risk of bias overall as aspects of bias, namely sequence generation, allocation concealment and blinding, were adequately achieved.</P>
<P>To assess the potential impact of loss to follow up on effect estimates in <LINK REF="STD-Ieran-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Ieran 1990</LINK>, we considered two assumptions; the worst-case scenario and the best-case scenario. In the worst-case scenario all the people lost to follow up were regarded as treatment failures (wounds not healed), and in the best-case scenario all the losses to follow up were considered as treatment successes (wounds healed). The significance of the results changed with the two assumptions made. In the worst-case scenario, the difference between the groups was found to be not statistically significant (RR 2.00; 95% CI 0.92 to 4.37) (<LINK REF="CMP-002.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.1</LINK>) while in the best-case scenario assumption the difference between the groups was shown to be statistically significant (RR 1.78; 95% CI 1.01 to 3.12) (<LINK REF="CMP-003.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.1</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="6">Number of wounds healed at 50 days</HEADING>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Kenkre-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Kenkre 1996</LINK> there was no loss to follow up. We grouped the two EMT treatment arms together. At day 50, 2/10 (20%) venous ulcers were healed in the EMT group compared with 2/9 (22%) in the sham-EMT group (RR 0.90; 95% CI 0.16 to 5.13). The difference between the groups was not statistically significant (<LINK REF="CMP-004.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.1</LINK>). This study was at unclear risk of bias as aspects of bias, namely sequence generation, allocation concealment and blinding, were not clear.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Stiller-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Stiller 1992</LINK> reported that at eight weeks, 1/18 (6%) in the EMT group and 3/13 people in the sham-EMT group (23%) were lost to follow up (overall 13%). No ulcers healed in the sham group, while 50% of ulcers either healed or showed marked improvement in the EMT group. This outcome was assessed subjectively and 'marked improvement' was not a pre-specified outcome, therefore these data are not included in the analysis. This study was at unclear risk of bias overall. </P>

<B>Reduction in wound size</B>

<P>The results from the three studies for the continuous outcome (reduction in wound size) could not be pooled. No trials reported any evaluation of the precision of the reduction in wound size (change from baseline). It was also not possible to derive missing data from the statistics provided.</P>
<P>Based on complete case analysis in <LINK REF="STD-Stiller-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Stiller 1992</LINK>, the ulcers in the EMT group were reported to decrease in size by 47% at eight weeks, whilst in the sham-EMT group the ulcers increased in size by 49% over the same time period (P value &lt; 0.0002). For the ITT analysis, the wound area at eight weeks of people who discontinued the study was determined by two methods: either by estimation by linear extrapolation to day 56, or by the use of the last observed wound area in place of the eight-week value. The results based on the last observed values were reported to be similar to those based on the extrapolated eight-week values. The EMT group averaged a 48% decrease in wound surface area compared with a 42% increase seen in the sham-EMT group (P value &lt; 0.0002). The ulcers appeared evenly matched for baseline size though ulcers in the sham group were of longer duration (a prognostic factor for time to heal).</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2011-02-15 14:54:23 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Three small trials involving a total of 94 patients were included in this review. Whilst one small trial reported significantly more ulcers healing with electromagnetic therapy (EMT) compared with sham-EM, this result was not robust to different assumptions regarding the outcomes of patients lost to follow up. One other trial did not show an effect in favour of EMT while the third trial did not assess the proportions of ulcers healed.</P>
<P>The extent to which the studies were at risk of bias was variable. Two of the three studies lacked clarity about the method of allocation concealment; there is evidence that inadequate allocation concealment leads to an overestimation of the treatment effect (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 2000</LINK>). The studies by <LINK REF="STD-Kenkre-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Kenkre 1996</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Stiller-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Stiller 1992</LINK> were at unclear risk of bias overall with the small study by <LINK REF="STD-Ieran-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Ieran 1990</LINK> at low to moderate risk of bias. 
</P>
<P>It is important for trials to use more objective measures of treatment success, such as time to complete healing, when assessing interventions in wound trials (<LINK REF="REF-Grey-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grey 2009</LINK>). Since the assessment of healing was based on a clinical global assessment in two of the trials, the blinding of the outcome assessor is critical to ensure detection bias has not been introduced. One study was inadequately blinded for investigator-assessed outcomes, even though indistinguishable EMT and sham devices were used (<LINK REF="STD-Kenkre-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Kenkre 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>The methods for handling missing data in the trials varied. <LINK REF="STD-Kenkre-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Kenkre 1996</LINK> did not have any drop-outs. <LINK REF="STD-Stiller-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Stiller 1992</LINK> imputed missing data using last observation carried forward analysis and estimation by linear extrapolation for wound area, while <LINK REF="STD-Ieran-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Ieran 1990</LINK> did not carry out ITT analysis. We examined whether the results changed and checked the robustness of the observed findings in <LINK REF="STD-Ieran-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Ieran 1990</LINK> by performing a worst-case scenario ITT analysis (all the people who dropped out considered as having wounds not healed) and a best-case scenario analysis (all the people who dropped out as having healed ulcers). The results changed with the two assumptions made with the assumption (all loss to follow up as having ulcers healed) showing a significant difference favouring EMT. However, the worst-case scenario assumption is an extreme and in most cases unrealistic assumption (<LINK REF="REF-Akl-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Akl 2009</LINK>). Nevertheless, our analysis was valuable in demonstrating that the effect estimate in <LINK REF="STD-Ieran-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Ieran 1990</LINK> did not remain statistically significant under the assumption of a worst-case scenario.</P>
<P>Another concern was that two of the studies were sponsored by the manufacturer of the electromagnetic devices (<LINK REF="STD-Kenkre-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Kenkre 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stiller-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Stiller 1992</LINK>), and whilst there is evidence that industry-sponsored trials may overestimate the treatment effect (<LINK REF="REF-Bhandari-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bhandari 2004</LINK>), we were unable to draw any firm conclusions as to whether this has affected the results of these trials.</P>

<P>Methodologically sound and robust RCTs are needed in order to investigate further any effect of using EMT to improve venous leg ulcer healing. When reporting these trials, authors should follow the CONSORT statement for reporting controlled trials (<LINK REF="REF-CONSORT-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">CONSORT 2010</LINK>) so that the trials can be accurately assessed by readers and reviewers. In addition, the procedures for diagnosing venous leg ulcers and the stage of the wound(s) should be described.</P>
<P>Future studies should explore the effects of EMT as an adjunct to optimum treatment with compression, and also as an option for people who cannot tolerate compression or for whom compression is contraindicated.</P>

<P>For this third update, we searched the following electronic databases:</P>
<P>The Cochrane Wounds Group Specialised Register (searched 12 November 2012);<BR/>The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (<I>The Cochrane Library</I> 2012, Issue 10);<BR/>Ovid MEDLINE (2011 to November Week 1 2012);<BR/>Ovid MEDLINE (In-Process &amp; Other Non-Indexed Citations, November 12, 2012);<BR/>Ovid EMBASE (2011 to 2012 Week 45);<BR/>EBSCO CINAHL (2011 to 9 November 2012).</P>

<P>The search strategies for Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid EMBASE and EBSCO CINAHL can be found in <LINK REF="APP-02" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 2</LINK>, <LINK REF="APP-03" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 3</LINK> and <LINK REF="APP-04" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 4</LINK>, respectively. We combined the Ovid MEDLINE search with the Cochrane Highly Sensitive Search Strategy for identifying randomised trials in MEDLINE: sensitivity- and precision-maximising version (2008 revision) (<LINK REF="REF-Lefebvre-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lefebvre 2011</LINK>). We combined the Ovid EMBASE and EBSCO CINAHL searches with the trial filters developed by the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (<LINK REF="REF-SIGN-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">SIGN 2009</LINK>). There were no restrictions on the basis of date or language of publication.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">1.  Was the allocation sequence randomly generated?</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Low risk of bias</HEADING>
<P>The investigators describe a random component in the sequence generation process such as: referring to a random number table; using a computer random number generator; coin tossing; shuffling cards or envelopes; throwing dice; drawing of lots.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">High risk of bias</HEADING>
<P>The investigators describe a non-random component in the sequence generation process. Usually, the description would involve some systematic, non-random approach, for example: sequence generated by odd or even date of birth; sequence generated by some rule based on date (or day) of admission; sequence generated by some rule based on hospital or clinic record number.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Unclear</HEADING>
<P>Insufficient information about the sequence generation process to permit judgement of low or high risk of bias.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">2.  Was the treatment allocation adequately concealed?</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Low risk of bias</HEADING>
<P>Participants and investigators enrolling participants could not foresee assignment because one of the following, or an equivalent method, was used to conceal allocation: central allocation (including telephone, web-based and pharmacy-controlled randomisation); sequentially-numbered drug containers of identical appearance; sequentially-numbered, opaque, sealed envelopes.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">High risk of bias</HEADING>
<P>Participants or investigators enrolling participants could possibly foresee assignments and thus introduce selection bias, such as allocation based on: using an open random allocation schedule (e.g. a list of random numbers); assignment envelopes were used without appropriate safeguards (e.g. if envelopes were unsealed or non opaque or not sequentially numbered); alternation or rotation; date of birth; case record number; any other explicitly unconcealed procedure.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Unclear</HEADING>
<P>Insufficient information to permit judgement of low or high risk of bias. This is usually the case if the method of concealment is not described or not described in sufficient detail to allow a definite judgement, for example if the use of assignment envelopes is described, but it remains unclear whether envelopes were sequentially numbered, opaque and sealed.</P>

<LI>Reason for missing outcome data likely to be related to true outcome, with either imbalance in numbers or reasons for missing data across intervention groups.</LI>
<LI>For dichotomous outcome data, the proportion of missing outcomes compared with observed event risk enough to induce clinically relevant bias in intervention effect estimate.</LI>
