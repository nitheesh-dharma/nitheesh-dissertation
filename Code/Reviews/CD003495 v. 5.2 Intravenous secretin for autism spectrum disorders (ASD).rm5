<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2012-02-26 05:58:22 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Secretin is a gastrointestinal hormone that was first presented as an effective treatment for ASD in 1998, based on anecdotal evidence. On the basis of these first reports many families sought treatment with intravenous secretin for their children with ASD even though secrein was not a proven, effective treatment and there was inadequate information about side effects when used in this group of children. This review included 16 randomised trials with a placebo control group, with over 900 children involved. The review found no evidence that single or multiple dose intravenous secretin is effective in improving the main problems seen in ASD, namely a lack of social interaction and communication and restrictive, repetitive behaviours and routines. As such, currently it should not be recommended or administered as a treatment for ASD. Further experimental assessment of secretin's effectiveness for ASD can only be justified if there is convincing new evidence that finds that secretin can influence brain function in a way that could benefit children with ASD or a link is proven between secretin and the known cause of ASD for some or all children.</P>

<P>In 1998 secretin, a gastrointestinal hormone, was suggested as an effective treatment for autism spectrum disorders (ASD) based on anecdotal evidence.</P>

<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2012-02-26 05:49:29 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>To assess whether intravenous secretin improves the core features of ASD, other aspects of behaviour or function such as self-injurious behaviour, and the quality of life of affected individuals and their carers. We also assessed whether secretin causes harm. This is an updated version of our review of this topic originally published in 2005.<BR/>

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2012-03-05 12:15:50 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We searched CENTRAL (2010 Issue 1), MEDLINE (1950 to January 2010) , EMBASE (1980 to 2010 Week 2), PsycINFO (1806 to 2010 Week 2), CINAHL (1938 to January 2010), ERIC (1966 to January 2010), Sociological Abstracts (1952 to January 2010). Sociofile and HealthStar were searched in March 2005 when this review was first published, but were not available for this update. Records were limited to studies published since 1998 as this is when secretin was first proposed as a possible treatment for ASD. We searched reference lists of trials and reviews; we also contacted experts and trialists to find unpublished studies.</P>

<P>Randomised controlled trials of intravenous secretin compared to a placebo treatment in children or adults diagnosed with ASD, where at least one standardised outcome measure was reported.</P>

<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2012-02-26 05:51:41 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Sixteen studies met the inclusion criteria but for two of these, conducted by Repligen, the only available multisite data were reported in press releases. All outcome data from the other 14 trials were continuous. Where trials used cross-over designs, we conducted analysis on results from the first treatment phase. Where mean change from baseline was reported, we used this in preference to post-treatment scores for meta-analyses or forest plots. Meta-analysis was able to be attempted for only one outcome (Childhood Autism Rating Scale). Insufficient data were available to conduct sensitivity or subgroup analyses to assess the impact of study quality, clinical differences in the intervention or clinically relevant differences between groups, such as age or presence of gastrointestinal symptoms.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-02-26 05:53:56 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Over 900 children were recruited for the secretin trials. Twenty-five established standardised outcome measures were reported to assess core features of ASD, communication, behaviour, visuospatial skills, affect and adverse events. One standardised measure of global impression was also used. No more than four studies used any one outcome measure similarly. When duration from the start of the intervention to outcome assessment was known, outcomes were reported at between three and six weeks. Meta-analysis of data was not possible but there is now consistency of findings, with RCTs of the efficacy of secretin in autism not showing improvements for core features of ASD.</P>

<P>There is no evidence that single or multiple dose intravenous secretin is effective and as such currently it should not be recommended or administered as a treatment for ASD. Further experimental assessment of secretin's effectiveness for ASD can only be justified if there is new high-quality and replicated scientific evidence that either finds that secretin has a role in neurotransmission in a way that could benefit all children with ASD or identifies important subgroups of children with ASD who could benefit from secretin because of a proven link between the action of secretin and the known cause of their ASD, or the type of problems they are experiencing.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">What are autism spectrum disorders?</HEADING>
<P>Although autism was first described in the 1940s (<LINK REF="REF-Kanner-1943" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kanner 1943</LINK>), the classification of autism and its aetiologies are still disputed. More recently the term 'autism spectrum disorders', or 'ASD', has been developed because children with abnormalities of communication, behaviour and social interaction of the type seen in autism have been identified who do not fulfil all the diagnostic criteria for autism. However, there is no diagnostic classification for autism spectrum disorders. As such, ASD are still diagnosed using either DSM-IV (<LINK REF="REF-APA-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">APA 2000</LINK>) or ICD-10 (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1993</LINK>) classification systems (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>). These versions have superseded all previous DSM and ICD classifications. Along with childhood autism or autistic disorder, diagnoses like Pervasive Developmental Disorder-Not Otherwise Specified (PDD-NOS), Asperger syndrome and atypical autism are now considered by many to be part of the autism spectrum. In addition, ICD-10 categories of other childhood disorders of social functioning (F94.8) and childhood disorders of social functioning, unspecified (F94.9), may also be relevant; as well as other codes for behavioural and language disturbances. As well as the diagnostic features of autism, many affected children also have intellectual impairment and some have other physical, behavioural and emotional problems. As such, ASD are heterogeneous conditions. In an attempt to standardise diagnostic practice and research, several diagnostic instruments have also been developed for ASD. Only four instruments are available for research use at present that relate scores to current diagnostic criteria. One of these tools is a behavioural assessment, the Autism Diagnostic Observation Scale (ADOS) (<LINK REF="REF-Lord-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lord 1997</LINK>); the other three are interviews: Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI-R) (<LINK REF="REF-Lord-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lord 1994</LINK>), The Diagnostic Interview for Social and Communication Disorders (DISCO) (<LINK REF="REF-Wing-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wing 1999</LINK>), and the third is The Developmental, Dimensional and Diagnostic Interview (<LINK REF="REF-Skuse-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Skuse 2004</LINK>). The Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS) (<LINK REF="REF-Schopler-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schopler 1980</LINK>) is another frequently used standardised assessment tool. Unfortunately, there is not complete agreement between these diagnostic methods.</P>
<P>A review and an update of epidemiological studies published between 1966 and 2003 show reports of the estimated prevalence for autism varying between 0.7 and 40 children per 10,000 (<LINK REF="REF-Fombonne-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fombonne 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fombonne-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fombonne 2003</LINK>). Estimates of the prevalence of ASD using the DSM-III, DSM-IIIR, DSM-IV or ICD-10 diagnostic classification systems from published synthesised literature up to April 2004 varied between 3 and 82 in 10,000 (<LINK REF="REF-Williams-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Williams 2006</LINK>), and from 2000 to 2007 between 16 and 181 in 10,000 (<LINK REF="REF-Fombonne-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fombonne 2009</LINK>). The problems seen in ASD usually present in childhood. Boys are affected about four times more frequently than girls. Although there is considerable agreement that the aetiology of ASD is multifactorial and probably involves genetic, neurodevelopmental and environmental pathways, the relative contribution of these aspects is still uncertain (<LINK REF="REF-Gillberg-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gillberg 2000</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Issues in therapy for autism spectrum disorders</HEADING>
<P>There are several generic issues that apply to therapies for ASD. The heterogeneity of symptoms and associated problems seen with this spectrum of disorders, and even within one diagnostic group such as classical autism, mean it is often difficult to be sure which individuals will benefit from therapies. As in other developmental abnormalities, there are likely to be changes over time for individuals with autism spectrum disorders. It is also likely that outcomes of therapy will be different depending on timing of therapy in relation to age and onset of problems. To date, pharmacological treatments have been, at best, useful adjuncts to behavioural intervention. They have been associated with improvements in problems such as sleep disturbance, mood disorder, poor attention and concentration, and self-harm or aggression to others. Many therapies suggested for individuals with ASD are invasive, time consuming and expensive, and there is little known about their potential to do harm. However, individuals with ASD and their families are seeking ways to improve their lives and futures. The many needs of these individuals trigger hope for cure. As a result, therapies like secretin have become widely used after limited reports of success.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Secretin</HEADING>
<P>Secretin is a 27 amino-acid polypeptide produced in the intestine. Its role in gastrointestinal function is well described. There is a postulated role in decreasing immune responses in the gut lumen. Secretin receptors have also been demonstrated in the brains of rats and pigs (<LINK REF="REF-Freier-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Freier 1981</LINK>) but the exact role of secretin and its mechanism of action in the central nervous system have not been determined. The behaviour of rats has been studied after secretin infusion (<LINK REF="REF-Charlton-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Charlton 1983</LINK>). When injected intracerebrally, secretin decreased the locomotor activity of rats. However, there is uncertainty about the role of secretin in the human brain.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Autism spectrum disorders and secretin</HEADING>
<P>Clinicians investigating children with a combination of gastrointestinal disorders and developmental symptoms of the type seen in ASD noticed improvements in ASD symptoms during their investigations. In a series of three cases, the administration of porcine secretin was seen to positively affect the behaviour of children with ASD (<LINK REF="REF-Horvath-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Horvath 1998</LINK>). Improvements in eye contact, alertness and language were noted. The children had incidentally been given the secretin during an endoscopic procedure. The study included some laboratory data suggesting physiological changes in some of these children. Following this report, the use of secretin became widespread. Subsequently, following reviews of published trials, it was stated that secretin is not an effective or recommended treatment for ASD (<LINK REF="REF-Perry-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Perry 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Roberts-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roberts 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Myers-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Myers 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-SIGN-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">SIGN 2007</LINK>).</P>

The aim of the search strategy was for high precision and recall. There were no language restrictions. We also reviewed reference lists of articles identified through the search strategy to identify trials.</P>
<P>In addition to the core searches for this update, we ran supplementary searches to locate data from the studies conducted by Repligen. On 17 October 2011 we searched  MEDLINE (1948 to week 1 October 2011), EMBASE (1948 to week 1 October 2011) and ABI/Inform using the terms (RG-1068 or repligen or secreflo). In November 2011 we also searched the websites of ClinicalTrials.gov, CenterWatch, US Food and Drug Administration, Autistic Society, Autism Research Institute, Autism Society, National Autistic Society, National Institute of Child Health &amp; Human Development and the Repligen Corporation. We made further contact by email with CenterWatch, the Autism Society, Autism Research Institute and the Repligen Corporation.</P>

One author (KW) used data extracted during 2005 to reclassify studies according to risk of bias criteria outlined in Chapter 8 of the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions </I>(<A HREF="http://archie.cochrane.org/sections/documents/view?document=447fbd3782e26aa200e1bfee51df2481&amp;published=true&amp;format=revman#ref-higgins-2009#ref-higgins-2009">Higgins 2008</A>). Risk of bias was assessed according to the following four domains, with ratings of low risk of bias, high risk of bias and unclear (uncertain) risk of bias.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">1. Sequence generation</HEADING>
<P>Was the allocation sequence adequately generated?</P>
<P>Low risk of bias: computer-generated random numbers, table of random numbers, coin tossing or similar.<BR/>High risk of bias: day of week, even and odd clinic record numbers, clinician judgment, participant preference, laboratory test result such as haemoglobin level or similar.<BR/>Unclear risk of bias: insufficient information about the sequence generation process to permit judgment.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">2. Allocation concealment</HEADING>
<P>Was allocation adequately concealed?</P>
<P>Low risk of bias: central independent unit, sequentially numbered drug containers, sealed envelopes of identical appearance or similar.<BR/>High risk of bias: alternation or rotation, date of birth, non-opaque envelopes, open table of random numbers or similar.<BR/>Unclear risk of bias: randomisation stated but no information on method used was available.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">3. Blinding</HEADING>
<P>Was knowledge of the allocated intervention adequately prevented during the study?</P>
<P>Low risk of bias: identical placebo medication or similar.<BR/>High risk of bias: intravenous secretin or placebo easily identified.<BR/>Unclear: blinding stated but no information on method used was available.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">4. Incomplete outcome data</HEADING>
<P>Were incomplete data dealt with adequately by the researchers?</P>
<P>Low risk of bias: no missing outcome data, missing outcome data balanced in numbers across intervention groups, reasons for dropouts and withdrawals described or similar.<BR/>High risk of bias: reason for missing outcome data likely to be related to true outcome or similar.<BR/>Unclear risk of bias: number or reasons for dropouts and withdrawals not described.</P>

<P>Where standardised assessment tools generated a score as the outcome measure, we made comparisons between the means of these scores. Where baseline means were reported, we determined differences between treatment and control groups to assess possible bias. Where mean change from baseline was reported, we used this in preference to post-treatment scores for meta-analyses or forest plots. Meta-analysis and forest plots included either post-treatment means or mean change, but these were not entered as subgroups because of small study numbers. One author (<LINK REF="STD-Kern-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Kern 2002</LINK>) provided raw data and we calculated mean change where change = post-treatment score - baseline score. We checked data from all included studies to ensure consistency.

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Selection procedure</HEADING>
<P>The first search for this review was completed at the end of February 2003 and yielded 84 titles (<LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>). Seventy-three papers were excluded because they were not randomised trials, did not have a placebo group or were not primarily about ASD. Full paper reviews were conducted for 11 studies and from these seven RCTs were identified. The search was repeated in February 2004 and six further published trials were identified. One unpublished study of 22 children, conducted by one of the authors of this review, was also provided (<LINK REF="STD-Wray" TYPE="STUDY">Wray</LINK>, personal communication). An author of one of the included trials informed us of phase II and III Repligen Corporation pharmaceutical trials (personal communication with T Owley (<LINK REF="STD-Owley-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Owley 2001</LINK>)).</P>
<P>We excluded four of the 11 studies that received full-paper review. One study presented data that were also presented in an included study (<LINK REF="STD-Owley-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Owley 2001</LINK>) and as such were not presented separately, one study used intramuscular rather than intravenous administration of secretin (<LINK REF="STD-Shin_x002d_Siung-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Shin-Siung 2000</LINK>) and two studies were not randomised (<LINK REF="STD-Lonsdale-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Lonsdale 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lightdale-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Lightdale 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>Repligen published a series of press releases reporting results of its phase II trials (<LINK REF="STD-Repligen-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Repligen 2002</LINK>) and one phase III (<LINK REF="STD-NCT00036244" TYPE="STUDY">NCT00036244</LINK>) trial. No further information about trial methods or data were forthcoming for either the phase II or phase III trials despite requests. A dissertation completed in 2004 was also identified and was unclassifiable at the time of first publication. Subsequently a dissertation abstract for that PhD has been found that reported results for 37 children who were part of a multicentre trial in which children aged three to six years were recruited and given three doses of intravenous secretin. This is the same method used for the phase II Repligen trial, which is the only multisite trial of this kind that has been reported. As such this study was listed as part of the Repligen 2002 study (<LINK REF="STD-Repligen-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Repligen 2002</LINK>) and data was not be presented separately. Another phase III Repligen trial, with participants who were children with autism and gastrointestinal dysfunction, was terminated and no information published (<LINK REF="STD-NCT00036231" TYPE="STUDY">NCT00036231</LINK>), so this study was excluded.</P>
<P>A search in March 2005 prior to publication of the initial review found no new trials. An updated search in 2007 yielded no new trials. From the 2010 search, two studies were identified as trials but one used transdermal, not intravenous, administration of secretin (<LINK REF="STD-Ratliff_x002d_Schaub-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ratliff-Schaub 2005</LINK>) and the other was a trial of healthy males that reported only neurological imagining outcomes (<LINK REF="STD-Yurgelun_x002d_Todd-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Yurgelun-Todd 2008</LINK>). The remaining studies were either reviews (4) or not related to the topic of secretin and autism (2). No new information about the Repligen trials was forthcoming from the supplementary searches conducted in October 2011. <I>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Design of included studies</HEADING>
<P>Sixteen randomised controlled trials including 911 children under 18 years were available at study completion. Nine studies used a cross-over treatment design (<LINK REF="STD-Wray" TYPE="STUDY">Wray</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chez-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Chez 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Corbett-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Corbett 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Owley-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Owley 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Carey-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Carey 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kern-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Kern 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Molloy-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Molloy 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sponheim-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Sponheim 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Levy-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Levy 2003</LINK>). That is, participants were given either secretin or placebo, outcomes were measured, a washout period followed (to allow any effects of the drug to wear off), then all participants were given the alternative treatment and outcomes measured again. The remaining seven trials were of parallel design where participants were given only one treatment, secretin or placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Sandler-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Sandler 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dunn_x002d_Geier-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Dunn-Geier 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Coniglio-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Coniglio 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Roberts-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Roberts 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Repligen-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Repligen 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Unis-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Unis 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-NCT00036244" TYPE="STUDY">NCT00036244</LINK>).</P>

<P>Risk of bias for the Repligen studies was unclear for all criteria as neither detailed published methods nor information from the company were available at the time of writing.</P>
<P>We assessed allocation concealment as adequate in six studies (<LINK REF="STD-Dunn_x002d_Geier-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Dunn-Geier 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Corbett-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Corbett 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Owley-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Owley 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kern-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Kern 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Molloy-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Molloy 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Levy-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Levy 2003</LINK>) and inadequate in one (<LINK REF="STD-Chez-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Chez 2000</LINK>). We contacted the authors of the trials in which allocation concealment or randomisation was unclear and asked them to provide further information. Information was forthcoming for three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Sandler-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Sandler 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Owley-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Owley 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sponheim-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Sponheim 2002</LINK>). Two studies provided details to indicate that randomisation or allocation concealment, or both, were adequate (<LINK REF="STD-Owley-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Owley 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sponheim-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Sponheim 2002</LINK>). One study provided details of pharmacy-based randomisation and allocation, but syringes were colour-tagged according to treatment allocation (<LINK REF="STD-Sandler-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Sandler 1999</LINK>). The unpublished study was randomised with adequate allocation concealment (<LINK REF="STD-Wray" TYPE="STUDY">Wray</LINK>).</P>
<P>For the nine cross-over trials, the 'washout' or treatment-free time ranged from three to eight weeks. It has been suggested that secretin treatment effects 'taper off' at about five weeks, but may continue for eight or more weeks (<LINK REF="REF-Rimland-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rimland 2000</LINK>). If the treatment is effective, and if this is the case, participants who had secretin as their first treatment may still exhibit the beneficial effects in the placebo phase. While cross-over trials are a useful methodological tool for boosting sample power, this systematic review has been limited to the first phase of cross-over trials to prevent biased underestimation of treatment effectiveness due to potentially inadequate washout periods.</P>
<P>In one study, there was an initial open-label trial of secretin followed by a second phase RCT for a subsample of 'responders' from the open-label study (<LINK REF="STD-Chez-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Chez 2000</LINK>). This study design would tend to overestimate treatment effectiveness. Because the RCT followed an open-label trial, this study assessed the effectiveness of a second dose of secretin, six weeks following an initial dose, rather than primary secretin treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Chez-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Chez 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>Five studies reported no loss to follow-up (<LINK REF="STD-Wray" TYPE="STUDY">Wray</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dunn_x002d_Geier-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Dunn-Geier 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Owley-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Owley 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kern-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Kern 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sponheim-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Sponheim 2002</LINK>).

Reasons for dropouts were not given by the authors. One study was terminated after 70% of randomised participants had completed treatment and follow-up because interim analysis indicated that the treatment difference was not large enough to justify continuation of the trial (<LINK REF="STD-Molloy-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Molloy 2002</LINK>). No study reported that intention-to-treat analysis was used. As an example of the use of analyses other than intention-to-treat analysis, in one paper the overall baseline data presented differs from the baseline presented graphically to illustrate treatment effect (<LINK REF="STD-Sandler-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Sandler 1999</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Outcome measures</HEADING>
<P>Twenty-one established standardised outcome measures were reported to assess core features of autism, communication, behaviour, visuospatial skills, affect and adverse events (see <LINK REF="APP-04" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 4</LINK>). Few studies used any one outcome measure in the same way. Thus possible meta-analyses were limited. Outcomes were reported at between three and six weeks for those where timing of outcome was available. Timing of outcome assessment for the Repligen studies (<LINK REF="STD-Repligen-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Repligen 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-NCT00036244" TYPE="STUDY">NCT00036244</LINK>) was unclear. The Repligen phase III study reported that dual primary outcomes were used: improvements in social interaction as measured by the ADOS and the parental Clinical global Impressions of change (CGI) (<LINK REF="STD-NCT00036244" TYPE="STUDY">NCT00036244</LINK>). Outcome measures for the phase II study included the ADOS (<LINK REF="STD-Repligen-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Repligen 2002</LINK>), but how it was used and whether other outcome measures were used is unclear from the reports available. Additional outcome assessments included a global assessment score (<LINK REF="STD-Kern-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Kern 2002</LINK>), a parent global behavior rating scale (<LINK REF="STD-Levy-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Levy 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wray" TYPE="STUDY">Wray</LINK>), visual analogue scale (VAS) for multiple domains (<LINK REF="STD-Sponheim-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Sponheim 2002</LINK>), a modified version of the secretin outcome survey (<LINK REF="STD-Unis-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Unis 2002</LINK>), an autism treatment evaluation checklist (<LINK REF="STD-Wray" TYPE="STUDY">Wray</LINK>) and gastrointestinal symptoms (<LINK REF="STD-Dunn_x002d_Geier-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Dunn-Geier 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Roberts-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Roberts 2001</LINK>).

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Analysis methods</HEADING>
<P>Data were analysed and presented in varying ways. Four studies presented secretin and control group means at baseline and post-treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Chez-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Chez 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Coniglio-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Coniglio 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Owley-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Owley 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Molloy-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Molloy 2002</LINK>). One of these studies also presented in the text some additional data about mean change (<LINK REF="STD-Owley-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Owley 2001</LINK>). Four studies presented mean change post-treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Sandler-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Sandler 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dunn_x002d_Geier-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Dunn-Geier 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Unis-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Unis 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Levy-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Levy 2003</LINK>). One study presented information graphically only (<LINK REF="STD-Kern-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Kern 2002</LINK>). Individual patient data, provided on request, were re-analysed for the purpose of this review (<LINK REF="STD-Kern-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Kern 2002</LINK>). Individual patient data were also provided for the unpublished study (<LINK REF="STD-Wray" TYPE="STUDY">Wray</LINK>). Two studies presented the results of an analysis of variance (<LINK REF="STD-Corbett-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Corbett 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Roberts-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Roberts 2001</LINK>). Two small studies presented individual participant changes, one (N = 8) used the Reliable Change Index (<LINK REF="STD-Carey-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Carey 2002</LINK>) and the other (N = 6) used the means of summary repeated measures for secretin and placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Sponheim-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Sponheim 2002</LINK>). One of these studies (<LINK REF="STD-Carey-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Carey 2002</LINK>) also presented post-test means by group for the Autism Behavior Checklist (ABC) (<LINK REF="REF-Aman-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aman 1986</LINK>).</P>
<P>One study reported Reliable Change Index and an analysis of variance, with graphical representation of treatment effects and baseline measures for outcomes (<LINK REF="STD-Coniglio-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Coniglio 2001</LINK>). No additional data were available following correspondence with the authors.</P>
<P>For outcome measures used by more than one study, analysis was often performed using different methods. In addition, although two studies reported results of the Preschool Language Scale (PLS)-3 (<LINK REF="REF-Zimmerman-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zimmerman 1992</LINK>), one did so as a standard score (<LINK REF="STD-Dunn_x002d_Geier-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Dunn-Geier 2000</LINK>) and the other as total language age equivalents (<LINK REF="STD-Coniglio-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Coniglio 2001</LINK>). <LINK REF="APP-05" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 5</LINK> shows the baseline scores for secretin and placebo groups in nine studies where the outcome measures were used by more than one study, when baseline information was available and data were available in a suitable form for meta-analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Sandler-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Sandler 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chez-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Chez 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dunn_x002d_Geier-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Dunn-Geier 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Coniglio-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Coniglio 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Owley-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Owley 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Carey-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Carey 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kern-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Kern 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Molloy-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Molloy 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Unis-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Unis 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>Scores were different at baseline for the secretin and placebo groups for the three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Owley-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Owley 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kern-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Kern 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Unis-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Unis 2002</LINK>) reporting the same outcome for the subscales of the Aberrant Behaviour Checklist (<LINK REF="REF-Aman-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aman 1986</LINK>) and the Gilliam Autism Rating Scale (GARS (<LINK REF="REF-Gilliam-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gilliam 1995</LINK>)) (<LINK REF="STD-Coniglio-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Coniglio 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Owley-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Owley 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Molloy-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Molloy 2002</LINK>). Of the two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Owley-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Owley 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Unis-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Unis 2002</LINK>) that reported social and communication subscales of the ADOS (<LINK REF="REF-Lord-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lord 1997</LINK>), one had large baseline differences that were significant for the social subscale (<LINK REF="STD-Owley-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Owley 2001</LINK>). The baseline communication component of the Vineland Adaptive Behaviour Scale (VABS) (<LINK REF="REF-Sparrow-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sparrow 1984</LINK>) was different for the secretin and placebo groups for one of the two studies reporting data in a form useable for meta-analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Owley-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Owley 2001</LINK>) and was not available for the other (<LINK REF="STD-Sandler-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Sandler 1999</LINK>). The PLS baseline scores were different for both studies reporting this outcome, albeit data were presented in different units (<LINK REF="STD-Dunn_x002d_Geier-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Dunn-Geier 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Coniglio-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Coniglio 2001</LINK>). Baseline measures of the CARS score (<LINK REF="REF-Schopler-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schopler 1980</LINK>) for the four studies in which it was used as an outcome measure were similar (<LINK REF="STD-Chez-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Chez 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dunn_x002d_Geier-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Dunn-Geier 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Coniglio-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Coniglio 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Molloy-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Molloy 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>When differences between baseline measures exist between groups, there is potential for biased estimation of treatment effect size. The direction of the bias (favouring treatment or control) will vary depending on the correlation between baseline score and change score and the type of analysis used (change score or post-treatment) (<LINK REF="REF-Vickers-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vickers 2001</LINK>). As such, data suitable for analysis were presented for different outcomes but a combination of data using different methods was only performed for the CARS (<LINK REF="REF-Schopler-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schopler 1980</LINK>). All cross-over trials that presented data suitable for meta-analysis reported sufficient data to enable assessment of outcomes prior to treatment cross-over.</P>

<P>Twelve studies presented information about core features of autism as an outcome measure (see also <LINK REF="APP-04" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 4</LINK>). <LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK> presents the overall scores for the CARS, GARS and Autism Behaviour Checklist, as standardised mean differences, for the six studies with suitable data available. As shown, no statistically significant result for treatment effectiveness was seen for the CARS, GARS or Autism Behaviour Checklist in these studies. One further study (<LINK REF="STD-Roberts-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Roberts 2001</LINK>) also reported that there was no significant effect for secretin versus placebo for the Autism Behaviour Checklist but the data available were not suitable for inclusion in a meta-analysis. <LINK REF="FIG-04" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 4</LINK> presents outcomes for the subgroups of the Autism Diagnostic Observation Scale (<LINK REF="REF-Lord-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lord 1997</LINK>) for the two studies with data suitable for this presentation. No significant differences for subgroup scores for these two tools, between secretin and placebo treatments, were reported. A further three studies reported no significant treatment effect for secretin as measured by the ADOS, but insufficient data were available for further analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Corbett-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Corbett 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Roberts-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Roberts 2001</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-NCT00036244" TYPE="STUDY">NCT00036244</LINK>). </P>

<P>Ten structured instruments were used to assess communication outcomes in eight studies, including the communication subscale of the ADOS-G and the VABS (see <LINK REF="APP-04" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 4</LINK>). Only the VABS communication score and the PLS-3 were used by two or more studies as an outcome measure. For the VABS only two studies had data available in a format suitable for meta-analysis and this is displayed in <LINK REF="FIG-05" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 5</LINK>. For the PLS-3, data were only available in one study in a form suitable for meta-analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Dunn_x002d_Geier-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Dunn-Geier 2000</LINK>). That study and two others (<LINK REF="STD-Coniglio-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Coniglio 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Roberts-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Roberts 2001</LINK>) reported no significant treatment effect over time as measured by the PLS-3.

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Behaviour</HEADING>
<P>Seven studies presented outcome information for changes to behaviours that were not core features of autism (see <LINK REF="APP-04" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 4</LINK>). Five used the Aberrant Behaviour Checklist (ABC) (<LINK REF="REF-Aman-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aman 1986</LINK>). The subgroup scores for the subscales of the ABC are presented in <LINK REF="FIG-06" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 6</LINK> for the three studies in which data were available in a suitable form. Data for parent and teacher report for the ABC was also available from one study (<LINK REF="STD-Carey-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Carey 2002</LINK>) and there was no improvement for secretin compared to placebo. However the data could not be included in the meta-analysis because there was considerable baseline variation between groups and the standard deviation for the change between baseline and post-treatment was not available. Another study reported that "ABC ratings did not differ throughout the study and were inconsistently completed by both parents and teachers", and no data were provided (<LINK REF="STD-Sponheim-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Sponheim 2002</LINK>). For the ABC, a high score is an indicator of a greater incidence of problem behaviours. Scores for the inappropriate speech subcategory are low across all studies. This may indicate that the children in these studies were generally pre-verbal due to the severity of their condition. In addition, one study analysed treatment response for the ABC subgroup scores for a subgroup of five children with current chronic diarrhoea and found a greater response to secretin compared to placebo in this group, which was significantly different for social withdrawal (P &lt; 0.002) (<LINK REF="STD-Kern-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Kern 2002</LINK>). This subgroup analysis was a post hoc analysis inclusion when the research team noticed a greater response in participants with chronic diarrhoea.</P>
<P>An additional two tools were used by three studies. Two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Sandler-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Sandler 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Owley-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Owley 2001</LINK>) reported no significant differences between secretin and placebo groups when using the VABS (Vineland Adaptive Behaviour Scale) (<LINK REF="REF-Sparrow-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sparrow 1984</LINK>). One study (<LINK REF="STD-Levy-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Levy 2003</LINK>) used the change score for the Ritvo Real-Life Rating Scale (<LINK REF="REF-Freeman-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Freeman 1986</LINK>) and found no statistically significant difference between secretin and placebo groups.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Affect</HEADING>
<P>The Minnesota Preschool Affect Rating Scale (MN-PARS) (<LINK REF="REF-Shapiro-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shapiro 1994</LINK>) was used by one study to assess the effectiveness of secretin for improving affect (<LINK REF="STD-Corbett-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Corbett 2001</LINK>). A significant difference was found for two variables, positive affect (P = 0.01) and activity (P = 0.05). The remaining variables (negative affect and self-regulation) were reported as not statistically significant. When the results of the parent completed MN-PARS subscales were compared with other standardised subscales measuring similar attributes, the results were not consistent. For example, the shared positive affect measure of the Communication and Symbolic Behavior Scale showed no difference between treatment and placebo groups (<LINK REF="STD-Corbett-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Corbett 2001</LINK>). Because the Activity Level scale records the child's level of motor activity regardless of their concentration, it was not thought to be a useful outcome measure when interpreted in isolation.</P>

None of the other parent reported improvements were consistent with measurable gains and there was no significant improvement in the treatment group compared with placebo. In one study, parents were asked about their continuing interest in secretin to treat their child. Despite knowing that the study found no significant improvement, 63% of parents in the treatment group and 76% of parents in the control remained interested in secretin (<LINK REF="STD-Sandler-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Sandler 1999</LINK>).</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2012-02-26 07:32:52 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The possible effectiveness of secretin as a treatment for ASD was first suggested by a report of improvement of the core features of autism following secretin administration during pancreatic stimulation testing of three children who had ASD with a history of regression in their development in association with bowel dysfunction problematic enough to warrant investigation (<LINK REF="REF-Horvath-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Horvath 1998</LINK>). The product development and dissemination that followed this report reflects the high level of unmet needs of children with ASD and their families, the power of market forces and the way we now function as a global community. The report was also followed by research studies attempting to provide evidence to aid the decision making of families, clinicians, pharmaceutical companies and health services.</P>
<P>RCTs of the efficacy of secretin in ASD have not shown improvements in the core features of ASD as initially reported (<LINK REF="REF-Horvath-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Horvath 1998</LINK>). A wide range of different potentially positive outcomes have been explored. However, the study methodology of many RCTs has meant that both over- and under-identification of true differences has been possible. Although limited data are available from the multisite studies conducted by Repligen, reported data indicate that secretin was not an effective treatment and further development of secretin for use in ASD has not continued.</P>
<P>Firstly, large numbers of outcomes and subscale scores have often been analysed, which has increased the likelihood of finding significant positive effects by chance (Type I error). Reporting results using adjusted statistical significance levels would address this problem. It is noteworthy that, even in the studies using multiple outcome measures, few positive effects of secretin have been shown.</P>
<P>Secondly, although some studies used sample size based on reported power calculation, many studies had a low sample size, which creates the possibility of not finding significant differences when they do exist (Type II error). The two largest studies (N = 124 and N = 132) failed to report detailed methods or results (<LINK REF="STD-Repligen-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Repligen 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-NCT00036244" TYPE="STUDY">NCT00036244</LINK>). Meta-analytic combination of data would have clarified if Type II errors were creating a lack of significant results, but this was not possible for reasons discussed previously and summarised below.</P>
<P>Thirdly, the outcome measures used have not always been suitable to assess change. Initial reports were of improvements of the core features of ASD, but there are few, if any, standardised tools that assess core features of ASD that have been designed to monitor change. Rather, these tools were designed to provide systematic diagnostic classification. Because the initial report of improvements did not include standardised assessments, it is unclear whether these tools would be adequate for monitoring the substantial changes expected. It is also unclear what degree of change would be considered of sufficient importance to the child and the family to warrant therapy.</P>
<P>Finally, the small sample size of studies, uncertain adequacy of allocation concealment and the play of chance have led to variations in outcome measures at baseline between treatment and placebo groups in a way that could bias outcomes and over- or under-estimate treatment effects. The largest study, by Repligen, has still not been fully reported. The variation in baseline scores has made synthesis of change scores and post-treatment scores inappropriate. </P>
<P>Clinical and methodological differences have also prevented meta-analyses of existing data. The 14 included studies used a diverse range of outcome measures, with no more than four studies using any one measure. There is also a great deal of variation between studies in regard to their diagnostic inclusion criteria, age range of participants, types of secretin used, dosage regime and length of follow-up. These variations mean that included studies are clinically diverse such that statistical heterogeneity is likely. In addition, the information presented to assess study methods was often inadequate.</P>
<P>Attempts to clarify methodological variations and gather missing data were frequently not successful, even though all studies were published during the period CONSORT guidelines were available (<LINK REF="REF-Moher-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 2001</LINK>) and data would usually be stored.</P>
<P>Additionally, published reports rarely contained subgroup analyses for important clinical groups, such as children who had early developmental regression or gastrointestinal problems, as in the first publication that suggested secretin was an effective treatment for autism. Structured assessment of these clinical features is not straightforward and the proportion of children with ASD with these problems is small, leading to sample size problems.</P>
<P>The research response to the theory about the effectiveness of secretin has shown that RCTs can be conducted for children with ASD and that research groups can organise themselves quickly when necessary. It has also highlighted the potential problems of different methodological approaches and contributed to the increasing awareness of the need for agreed diagnostic classification systems and responsive outcomes to monitor change over time (<LINK REF="REF-Kasari-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kasari 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>One dose of secretin has not been shown to be effective in improving the core features of autism for all children with autism or other ASDs. There is no evidence to suggest that a single dose of intravenous secretin should be made available to all children with ASD. It also seems unlikely that multiple dose therapy is effective (<LINK REF="STD-NCT00036244" TYPE="STUDY">NCT00036244</LINK>). Although no serious side effects have been reported, the risk to a child of serious side effects is likely to increase with repeated doses and more adverse events are likely to be reported if secretin is made widely available. A similar conclusion that "...studies have demonstrated that secretin is not effective for improving language, cognition, behavior, communication, autism symptom severity, or socialization skills" was reached by a recent systematic review of secretin, which included eight studies (<LINK REF="REF-Krishnaswami-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Krishnaswami 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>Whether secretin is effective for some subgroups of children with ASD is uncertain but guidelines have reported that "...no subgroup of children who benefit has been consistently identified" (<LINK REF="REF-SIGN-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">SIGN 2007</LINK>). It is still true that information about effectiveness in subgroups of children has not yet been measured in an adequate sample size. Further explorations of effectiveness of secretin for subgroups of children with autism should only be undertaken if there is biological plausibility for effectiveness in the subgroup and the findings can be translated into practice. Any such research would also need to provide valid evidence about improvements in outcomes that are of value to children with autism and their families. For example, effectiveness of therapy for a subgroup of children that are only reliably identified using procedures only available in a research setting would not be able to be translated to improved outcomes for children and families in a clinical setting.</P>

<P>Further experimental assessment of secretin's effectiveness for autism can only be justified if there is new high-quality and replicated scientific evidence that either:</P>
<P>1. finds that secretin has a role in neurotransmission in a way that could benefit all children with autism; or</P>
<P>2. identifies important subgroups of children with autism who could benefit from secretin because of a proven link between the action of secretin and the known cause of their autism or type of problems they are experiencing.</P>
<P>If further studies are planned they must overcome the methodological problems of existing research, so that precise, valid, applicable and clinically useful information is gathered. As such they must:</P>
<OL>
<LI>follow CONSORT guidelines for study design and reporting;</LI>
<LI>allow an adequate wash-out period where a cross-over trial is planned;</LI>
<LI>carefully review appropriate outcome measures for their suitability for assessing change, their clinical importance, and equivalence to existing evidence, and consult consumers about outcome selection.</LI>
