<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2008-05-13 14:53:13 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<P>Acute renal failure (ARF) is an abrupt reduction in kidney function with elevation of blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and plasma creatinine and a fall in urine output. In most cases correction of the underlying cause leads to recovery, however for many some form of renal replacement therapy (RRT - a treatment that removes waste products, salts and excess water form the body) may be required. RRT can either be intermittent (IRRT- performed for less than 24 hours in each 24 hour period, two to seven times per week) or continuous (CRRT- performed continuously without any interruption throughout each day). It has been suggested that CRRT has several advantages over IRRT including better haemodynamic stability (blood pressure control and blood circulation), improved survival and greater likelihood of renal recovery. Our systematic review identified 15 randomised studies with 1550 patients comparing CRRT with IRRT. We did not find any difference between CRRT and IRRT with respect to mortality, renal recovery, and risk of haemodynamic instability or hypotension episodes.</P>

<P>Renal replacement therapy (RRT) for acute renal failure (ARF) can be applied intermittently (IRRT) or continuously (CRRT). It has been suggested that CRRT has several advantages over IRRT including better haemodynamic stability, lower mortality and higher renal recovery rates. </P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To compare CRRT with IRRT to establish if any of these techniques is superior to each other in patients with ARF.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL). Authors of included studies were contacted, reference lists of identified studies and relevant narrative reviews were screened. <I>Search date</I>: October 2006.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>RCTs comparing CRRT with IRRT in adult patients with ARF and reporting prespecified outcomes of interest were included. Studies assessing CAPD were excluded.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2008-05-13 14:14:50 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<P>Two authors assessed trial quality and extracted data. Statistical analyses were performed using the random effects model and the results expressed as risk ratios (RR) for dichotomous outcomes or mean difference (MD) for continuous data with 95% confidence intervals (CI).</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2008-05-13 14:14:19 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<P>We identified 15 studies (1550 patients). CRRT did not differ from IRRT with respect to in-hospital mortality (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.12), ICU mortality (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.26), number of surviving patients not requiring RRT (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.07), haemodynamic instability (RR 0.48, 95% CI 0.10 to 2.28) or hypotension (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.16) and need for escalation of pressor therapy (RR 0.53, 95% CI 0.26 to 1.08). Patients on CRRT were likely to have significantly higher mean arterial pressure (MAP) (MD 5.35, 95% CI 1.41 to 9.29) and higher risk of clotting dialysis filters (RR, 95% CI 8.50 CI 1.14 to 63.33).</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>In patients who are haemodynamically stable, the RRT modality does not appear to influence important patient outcomes, and therefore the preference for CRRT over IRRT in such patients does not appear justified in the light of available evidence. CRRT was shown to achieve better haemodynamic parameters such as MAP. Future research should focus on factors such as the dose of dialysis and evaluation of newer promising hybrid technologies such as SLED. Triallists should follow the recommendations regarding clinical endpoints assessment in RCTs in ARF made by the Working Group of the Acute Dialysis Quality Initiative Working Group.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-05-13 15:59:56 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<P>Acute renal failure (ARF) is defined as a sudden, sustained decline in glomerular filtration rate (GFR), usually associated with uraemia and a fall in urine output (<LINK REF="REF-Nissenson-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nissenson 1998</LINK>). The incidence of ARF requiring renal replacement therapy (RRT) in the adult population in Scotland has been reported to be 207/million/year (<LINK REF="REF-Metcalfe-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Metcalfe 2002</LINK>). In many cases of ARF, correction of underlying problems may allow recovery, but in a substantial fraction of patients, particularly those patients in intensive care units (ICUs) who frequently have additional clinical problems, recovery is less certain and there is a requirement for continuing support with RRT. The mortality for ARF patients who require RRT in an ICU setting is estimated to be 50% to 70%, a figure that has changed little over the past 30 years, despite advances in medical care (<LINK REF="REF-Barton-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barton 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Chertow-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chertow 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kennedy-1973" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kennedy 1973</LINK>). The failure to reduce ARF mortality may be due, at least in part, to increases in the age and complexity of current patients with ARF (<LINK REF="REF-Turney-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Turney 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>A number of strategies for RRT may be used in ARF. RRT can be applied intermittently (IRRT), e.g. intermittent haemodialysis (IHD) or continuously (CRRT), as in continuous venovenous haemofiltration (CVVHF). In IHD removal of fluid, solutes and toxins is achieved typically through a dual venous access, over a period of three to five hours, three to seven times weekly. Solute removal is achieved by diffusion and is rapid and efficient (<LINK REF="REF-Murray-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Murray 2000</LINK>). Rapid fluid removal during IHD has been suggested to lead to hypotension, with the potential for further renal injury and prolongation of ARF (<LINK REF="REF-Manns-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Manns 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>All continuous therapies use highly-permeable filters such that the bulk of solute removal occurs by convective transfer (<LINK REF="REF-Murray-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Murray 2000</LINK>). Convective solute removal is less efficient than diffusive, but the continuous nature of the therapy compensates for this and bulk solute removal has been reported to be higher than with IHD (<LINK REF="REF-Clark-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clark 1994</LINK>). In some forms of CRRT dialysate is run countercurrent to the blood flow, so that the diffusive solute removal of haemodialysis is combined with the convective solute removal of haemofiltration. This form of RRT called haemodiafiltration (HDF) has been reported to offer superior solute removal. Access for CRRT may be via dual venous access (CVVH, CVVHF, CVVHDF) or via arterial and venous access (CAVH, CAVHF, CAVHDF). For all forms of CRRT, putative advantages include improved haemodynamic stability, more effective control of acid/base and electrolyte status, improved removal of uraemic toxins, and removal of inflammatory mediators, particularly in those patients with systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS; septic shock) (<LINK REF="REF-De-Vriese-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">De Vriese 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jakob-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jakob 1996</LINK>). While these advantages are widely reported, they are not universally accepted (<LINK REF="REF-Jakob-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jakob 1996</LINK>). The principal disadvantages of CRRT modalities include the need for prolonged systemic anticoagulation, with attendant risk of major bleeding, and the requirement for additional nursing and other resources.</P>
<P>There is evidence for both IRRT (<LINK REF="REF-Schiffl-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schiffl 2002</LINK>) and CRRT (<LINK REF="REF-Ronco-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ronco 2000</LINK>), that increasing the delivered dialysis dose improves outcome. What is less clear is which, if any, approach is preferable. Individual studies comparing the therapies have suggested that CRRT offers superior biochemical control and improved patient outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-Bellomo-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bellomo 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kruczynski-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kruczynski 1993</LINK>). However, a number of authoritative reviews that have addressed the pros and cons of IHD versus CRRT for patients with ARF have been unable to provide objective evidence of the superiority of one approach over the other (<LINK REF="STD-Kellum-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Kellum 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tonelli-2002a" TYPE="STUDY">Tonelli 2002a</LINK>). The purpose of this systematic review is to evaluate whether IHD or CRRT provides superior outcomes for patients with ARF.</P>

Two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Mehta-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Mehta 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Noble-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Noble 2006</LINK>) used bioincompatible membranes (cuprophane) for IRRT.

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2008-05-13 16:01:17 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<P>We identified 15 RCTs with 1550 patients comparing CRRT with IRRT. The key findings from our systematic review are:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>CRRT offers no survival advantage over IRRT in patients with ARF</LI>
<LI>Patients surviving ARF who are managed with CRRT have a similar expectation of recovery of renal function as those treated with IRRT</LI>
<LI>CRRT is associated with a significantly higher MAP</LI>
<LI>CRRT is associated with a significantly increased risk of recurrent filter clotting compared to IRRT</LI>
</UL>
<P>The results of this review are consistent with those reported in individual RCTs that have compared CRRT and IRRT directly. They are however, at odds with the generally positive benefits for CRRT compared to IRRT reported in some single centre or non-randomised studies (<LINK REF="REF-Ji-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ji 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Swartz-1999b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Swartz 1999b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-van-Bommel-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Bommel 1995</LINK>). These studies, in general, are weaker in design, often employing historic controls. The disease severity scores in these studies were generally higher for patients on CRRT. A recent observational study (<LINK REF="STD-Cho-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Cho 2006</LINK>) comparing 206 patients on CRRT with 192 patients on IRRT and adjusting for confounding factors such as age, organ failure, sepsis and propensity scores reported a significantly higher mortality in patients on CRRT (RR 1.92, 95% CI 1.28 to 2.89). A meta-analysis of non-randomised studies (<LINK REF="REF-Tonelli-2002b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tonelli 2002b</LINK>) had previously failed to show a difference in mortality between CRRT and IRRT (12 studies, 1252 patients: RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.08).</P>
<P>Our systematic review in keeping with previous meta-analyses (<LINK REF="STD-Kellum-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Kellum 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tonelli-2002b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tonelli 2002b</LINK>) has not shown CRRT to be better than IRRT with respect to the most important clinical outcomes of mortality and renal function survival. It is interesting to note that even the latest reported trial (<LINK REF="STD-Vinsonneau-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Vinsonneau 2006</LINK>) shows a high mortality rate of 58%. Two recent observational studies from the US have shown that whilst mortality from ARF remains high, it has declined gradually over the past two decades (<LINK REF="REF-Waikar-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Waikar 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Xue-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Xue 2006</LINK>). However it is unclear if the wider usage of CRRT during the time period of these observational studies has had any role in the mortality decline (<LINK REF="REF-Lameire-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lameire 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>Renal recovery has important implications for both the patient and the health care system. Not only can it result in considerable savings by way of avoiding the need for chronic dialysis it can also result in significantly improved quality of life for the patient (<LINK REF="REF-de-Wit-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">de Wit 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Merkus-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Merkus 1997</LINK>). CRRT has been shown to have a beneficial effect in terms of better renal recovery (<LINK REF="REF-Manns-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Manns 2003</LINK>). Our review has however found no difference between either modality with respect to renal recovery amongst surviving patients. A recent narrative review by <LINK REF="REF-Palevsky-2005b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Palevsky 2005b</LINK> on factors affecting renal recovery following ARF has also concluded that no overall benefit can be ascribed to either modality with regards to renal recovery when the competing mortality risk is taken into account.</P>
<P>This analysis also indicates that CRRT is associated with an increased likelihood of filter clotting compared to IRRT. In fact failure to maintain integrity of the CRRT dialysis circuit was the major reason for patients switching from CRRT to IRRT in the studies assessed. Individual non-randomised studies have reported this previously.</P>
<P>Advantages with CRRT found in our review are that patients on CRRT show a trend towards being less likely to need escalation of their pressor treatment and having significantly high mean arterial pressures. Our analysis however did not show any difference between both treatment groups with regards to the risk of episodes of haemodynamic instability or hypotension. It has been suggested by <LINK REF="STD-Kellum-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Kellum 2002</LINK> that a large RCT involving 660 patients per group would be necessary in order to resolve the mortality question definitively. Such a study would be very expensive and, it has been suggested, impractical to run as a multicentre trial involving many different intensive care units. We feel that our meta-analysis probably obviates the need for such a trial. Our in-hospital mortality analysis included seven studies with 1245 patients, almost closely approaching the total number of patients suggested by <LINK REF="STD-Kellum-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Kellum 2002</LINK> and importantly, the analysis also indicated that there was no significant heterogeneity between the studies.</P>
<P>The major strengths of this analysis are that it represents a comprehensive systematic review based on a detailed pre-study protocol developed in conjunction with the Cochrane Collaboration, rigid inclusion criteria for RCTs only, and a very comprehensive search strategy of all major medical electronic databases and other sources. Data extraction, data analysis, and method quality assessment for each study were performed by two independent investigators. As far as we are aware this systematic review is the most up to date meta-analysis of all published and unpublished RCTs that have compared CRRT to IRRT for patients with ARF. We have also been quite comprehensive in the assessment of outcomes when compared to previous reviews. In addition to the major outcomes such as mortality and renal recovery, we have also assessed other clinically important outcomes such as haemodynamic stability, complications of treatment such as clotting of filters and bleeding.</P>
<P>Despite the inclusion of four further studies (<LINK REF="STD-Gasparovic-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Gasparovic 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kielstein-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Kielstein 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-SHARF-2005" TYPE="STUDY">SHARF 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vinsonneau-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Vinsonneau 2006</LINK>) with 820 patients that were published since the last systematic review by <LINK REF="REF-Tonelli-2002b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tonelli 2002b</LINK>, the principal conclusions remain unchanged.</P>
<P>The major weakness of this analysis is that none of the RCTs are individually large enough to provide an accurate evaluation of the differences in outcome between the treatments, given the effect size suggested by the retrospective analyses. The studies by <LINK REF="STD-Mehta-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Mehta 2001</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Uehlinger-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Uehlinger 2005</LINK> included patients with pre-existing chronic kidney disease while all of the other RCTs excluded such patients. In <LINK REF="STD-Mehta-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Mehta 2001</LINK> there are differences between groups in APACHE III score at enrolment. Crossovers from one modality to the other could have influenced the results. The number of patients crossing to an alternate RRT modality was 89/488 in the CRRT group, more than those on IRRT (56/450). This was due to medical reasons (complications due to the RRT such as clotting, haemodynamic instability), this difference was not statistically significant (RR 1.42, 95% CI 0.58 to 3.48) when <LINK REF="STD-Mehta-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Mehta 2001</LINK> was included however when <LINK REF="STD-Mehta-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Mehta 2001</LINK> was omitted, statistically less patients switched from IRRT (RR 1.89, 95% CI 1.36 to 2.63). Considerable variations were noted in the definitions for ARF and key outcomes such as haemodynamic stability and hypotension. The lack of consistency in the reporting of key outcomes such as mortality is one of the major weaknesses in this whole area. The included studies have been conducted over varying time periods and showed considerable clinical heterogeneity in terms of the dialysis treatment (dose, dialysis membrane) and patient characteristics.</P>
<P>Several outcomes (number of days until hospital discharge, survival time in patients who died, mean arterial pressure, systolic blood pressure, number of patients requiring escalation of pressor therapy, dose of inotropes and patients with clotting of dialysis filter) should be interpreted with caution owing to the fact that very few studies reported these outcomes and patient numbers in these analyses are quite small. It must also be noted that several RCTs excluded patients considered to be haemodynamically unstable from the randomisation process itself. It is therefore possible that these studies may have not been able to demonstrate the superiority of CRRT over IRRT with respect to haemodynamic stability.</P>
<P>The cost of RRT for patients with ARF is high. For IRRT major costs include the need for supervision by a trained dialysis nurse, which can become an economic issue if IRRT is performed on a frequent or daily basis. For CRRT major costs include disposables and replacement fluids. A recent economic analysis of the costs of RRT for patients with ARF estimated that mean adjusted total costs were Can$1342/week for IRRT compared to Can$3486/week for CRRT (<LINK REF="REF-Manns-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Manns 2003</LINK>). Another study (<LINK REF="REF-Rauf-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rauf 2005</LINK>) showed that the total hospitals cost (from start of RRT to hospital discharge) for patients on CRRT was US$57,000 more than that for those on IRRT. Although currently CRRT is the mode of choice for acutely ill patients with haemodynamic compromise, the case for CRRT in haemodynamically stable patients with ARF is not quite convincing based on clinically important outcomes such as mortality and renal recovery. Therefore in this subgroup of patients the additional expenses associated with CRRT may not be justified.</P>

<P>In patients with ARF who are haemodynamically stable, the RRT modality does not appear to influence important patient outcomes and therefore the preference for CRRT over IRRT in such patients does not appear to be justified in the light of available evidence. In haemodynamically unstable patients, CRRT may however be preferable as patients on CRRT appear to achieve higher MAP and show a trend towards lesser need for escalation of vasopressor therapy and arrhythmias.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Future research should focus on factors such as the dose of dialysis and evaluation of newer promising hybrid technologies such as SLED. Triallists should also endeavour to follow the recommendations regarding clinical endpoints assessment in RCTs in ARF made by the Working Group of the Acute Dialysis Quality Initiative Working Group (<LINK REF="REF-Palevsky-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Palevsky 2002</LINK>). All studies should endeavour to use common definitions for ARF and outcomes such as hypotension. The Acute Renal Failure Trial Network study (<LINK REF="STD-Palevsky-2005a" TYPE="STUDY">Palevsky 2005a</LINK>) aims to recruit 1164 patients with ARF the design of the study is intended to deliver data on comparison between low and high dose of dialysis using both IRRT and CRRT techniques. The Augmented Versus Normal Renal Replacement Therapy in Severe Acute Renal Failure study by The Australia and New Zealand Intensive Care Group (<LINK REF="STD-ANZICS-2005" TYPE="STUDY">ANZICS 2005</LINK>) will compare CVVHDF at a dose of 25 or 40 mL/kg/h in 1500 patients. These two large RCTs that are under way look very promising in providing clinicians with robust data that will help deliver the most appropriate RRT strategies for patients with ARF.</P>

</CHAR_PARTICIPANTS>
<CHAR_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>In both arms, RRT will be initiated using the same criteria. Hemodynamically stable patients (SOFA cardiovascular score:<BR/>0-2) will receive intermittent hemodialysis (IHD) while hemodynamically unstable patients (SOFA cardiovascular score: 3-4) will be treated with continuous venovenous hemodiafiltration (CVVHDF) or sustained low-efficiency hemodialysis (SLED). Patients will convert between modalities of therapy as hemodynamic status changes over time. The intensity of therapy in IHD and SLED will vary between groups based on treatment frequency; with treatments provided 6-times per week in the intensive management strategy arm and 3-times per week in the conventional management strategy arm. In CVVHDF, intensity of therapy will vary based on effluent flow rate with a prescribed flow rate of 35 mL/kg/hour in the intensive management strategy arm and 20 mL/kg/hour in the conventional management strategy arm.</P>
