<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2011-07-04 13:57:38 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The studies in this review focused on patients with cancers in the oral cavity. These studies have not shown that surgery to remove the lymph nodes in the neck, which appear to be cancer-free, at the same time as the cancer is removed is associated with longer survival, but there is evidence that early neck surgery reduces recurrence of the cancer. Neither is there evidence that removal of all the lymph nodes in the neck results in longer survival compared to selective surgical removal of affected lymph nodes. Although removal of lymph nodes from the neck is associated with significant adverse effects related to appearance and functions such as eating, drinking and speaking, the studies in this review did not measure quality of life.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2011-06-23 09:33:05 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Surgery is an important part of the management of oral cavity cancer with regard to both the removal of the primary tumour and removal of lymph nodes in the neck. Surgery is less frequently used in oropharyngeal cancer. Surgery alone may be treatment for early stage disease or surgery may be used in combination with radiotherapy, chemotherapy and immunotherapy/biotherapy. There is variation in the recommended timing and extent of surgery in the overall treatment regimens of people with these cancers.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2011-05-27 22:18:42 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>To determine which surgical treatment modalities for oral cavity and oropharyngeal cancers result in increased overall survival, disease free survival, progression free survival and reduced recurrence.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2011-06-23 09:34:22 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The following electronic databases were searched: the Cochrane Oral Health Group Trials Register (to 17 February 2011), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2011, Issue 1), MEDLINE via OVID (1950 to 17 February 2011) and EMBASE via OVID (1980 to 17 February 2011). There were no restrictions regarding language or date of publication.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2011-02-01 12:39:57 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Randomised controlled trials where more than 50% of participants had primary tumours of the oral cavity or oropharynx, and which compared two or more surgical treatment modalities or surgery versus other treatment modalities. </P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2011-07-04 13:56:10 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Data extraction and assessment of risk of bias was undertaken independently by two or more review authors. Study authors were contacted for additional information as required. Adverse events data were collected from published trials.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2011-07-04 13:57:00 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Seven trials (n = 669; 667 with cancers of the oral cavity) satisfied the inclusion criteria, but none were assessed as low risk of bias. Trials were grouped into three main comparisons. Four trials compared elective neck dissection (ND) with therapeutic neck dissection in patients with oral cavity cancer and clinically negative neck nodes, but differences in type of surgery and duration of follow-up made meta-analysis inappropriate. Three of these trials reported overall and disease free survival. One trial showed a benefit for elective supraomohyoid neck dissection compared to therapeutic ND in overall and disease free survival. Two trials found no difference between elective radical ND and therapeutic ND for the outcomes of overall survival and disease free survival. All four trials found reduced locoregional recurrence following elective ND.</P>
<P>A further two trials compared elective radical ND with elective selective ND and found no difference in overall survival, disease free survival or recurrence. The final trial compared surgery plus radiotherapy to radiotherapy alone but data were unreliable because the trial stopped early and there were multiple protocol violations.</P>
<P>None of the trials reported quality of life as an outcome. Two trials, evaluating different comparisons reported adverse effects of treatment.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2011-07-04 13:57:08 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Seven included trials evaluated neck dissection surgery in patients with oral cavity cancers. The review found weak evidence that elective neck dissection of clinically negative neck nodes at the time of removal of the primary tumour results in reduced locoregional recurrence, but there is insufficient evidence to conclude that elective neck dissection increases overall survival or disease free survival compared to therapeutic neck dissection. There is very weak evidence from one trial that elective supraomohyoid neck dissection may be associated with increased overall and disease free survival. There is no evidence that radical neck dissection increases overall survival compared to conservative neck dissection surgery. Reporting of adverse events in all trials was poor and it was not possible to compare the quality of life of patients undergoing different surgeries.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2011-07-04 14:20:08 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Oral cancers are a significant disease group globally with more than 404,000 new cases worldwide in 2002 (<LINK REF="REF-Parkin-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parkin 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Warnakulasuriya-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Warnakulasuriya 2009</LINK>). Oral cancers are the sixth most common cancer worldwide, accounting for an estimated 4% of all cancers. The incidence and mortality from oral cancers varies geographically; the highest age standardised rates of oral cancers are reported in parts of Europe (France, Hungary), Botswana and south central Asia (Sri Lanka, Pakistan, Banglasdesh and India) (<LINK REF="REF-Parkin-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parkin 2005</LINK>). There is overwhelming evidence that tobacco use, alcohol consumption and betel quid chewing are the main risk factors in the aetiology of intraoral cancer (<LINK REF="REF-La-Vecchia-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">La Vecchia 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Macfarlane-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Macfarlane 1995</LINK>). There is also strong evidence that low socio-economic status is associated with a higher incidence and poorer survival of oral cancers (<LINK REF="REF-Faggiano-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Faggiano 1997</LINK>). There is a higher incidence of oral cancers in men (<LINK REF="REF-Freedman-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Freedman 2007</LINK>) that is generally attributed to a greater exposure to the known risk factors and vast majority of cases occur in men over 50 (<LINK REF="REF-Warnakulasuriya-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Warnakulasuriya 2009</LINK>) and among low socio-economic groups (<LINK REF="REF-Conway-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Conway 2008</LINK>). However, the ratio of males to females diagnosed with oral cancers has declined from approximately 5:1 in the 1960s to less than 2:1 in 2002 (<LINK REF="REF-Parkin-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parkin 2005</LINK>). Another recent trend is the increasing incidence of oral cavity and oropharyngeal cancers in younger adults in the European Union and the United States (<LINK REF="REF-Warnakulasuriya-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Warnakulasuriya 2009</LINK>).<BR/>
</P>
<P>The epidemiological data concerning 'oral cancer' obscures the fact that 'oral cancer' includes both oral cavity and oropharyngeal cancers which have clinically different aetiology, are generally diagnosed at different stages and managed in different ways. In the past, clinical trials have recruited patients with head and neck cancers as if this was a single disease entity (<LINK REF="REF-Adelstein-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Adelstein 2009</LINK>). However patients with oral cavity cancers generally present with early stage disease and the primary treatment is surgery or radiotherapy or both. Oropharyngeal cancers are likely to be advanced at the time of diagnosis and primary treatment for these patients is more likely to be radiation therapy or chemoradiation. It is now recognised that oral infection with human papilloma virus (HPV) is strongly associated with the development of oropharyngeal cancer where HPV infection is found in 40% to 60% of patients, especially younger male patients (<LINK REF="REF-Adelstein-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Adelstein 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-D_x0027_Souza-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">D'Souza 2007</LINK>), and HPV is associated with the increased incidence of oropharyngeal cancer (<LINK REF="REF-Adelstein-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Adelstein 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hammarstedt-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hammarstedt 2006</LINK>). The link between oncogenic HPV and oropharyngeal cancer is strong and has been documented in numerous studies, fulfilling the epidemiological criteria for disease causality, especially in the development of oropharyngeal cancer in non-smokers (<LINK REF="REF-Sturgis-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sturgis 2007</LINK>). The proportion of patients with oropharyngeal cancer who are HPV positive has increased dramatically over recent years (<LINK REF="REF-Attner-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Attner 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ryerson-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ryerson 2008</LINK>) but it is interesting to note that this group of patients have significantly improved rates of both overall survival and disease free survival (<LINK REF="REF-Adelstein-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Adelstein 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fakhry-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fakhry 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fakhry-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fakhry 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Licitra-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Licitra 2006</LINK>).<BR/>
<BR/>The most common cancer of the oral cavity is the squamous cell carcinoma that arises from the lining of the oral cavity; over 95% of all oral cavity cancers are squamous cell carcinomas. Despite significant technical advances in the treatment of oral cancer, it still has a significant mortality with 128,000 deaths recorded, representing nearly half of the incident cases (48%) (<LINK REF="REF-Parkin-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parkin 2001</LINK>). Survival following a diagnosis of oral cavity or oropharyngeal cancer remains poor with 5-year survival around 50% overall, with only limited improvement in the past 3 decades (<LINK REF="REF-Warnakulasuriya-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Warnakulasuriya 2009</LINK>).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Description of the intervention</HEADING>
<P>Surgery can be combined with any combination of radiotherapy, chemotherapy and immunotherapy/biotherapy; the sequence of these combination therapies is also considered important. Radiotherapy is typically now administered postoperatively. Chemotherapy can be given: i) before surgery (induction/neoadjuvant - when treatment is administered before the primary therapy, e.g. it is used to shrink a tumour prior to surgery or radiation); ii) after surgery (adjuvant - cancer treatment that is administered after the primary therapy, e.g. when the primary therapy to treat a cancerous tumour is surgery, chemotherapy would be considered an adjuvant therapy) and before radiotherapy; iii) at the same time as radiotherapy (concomitant/concurrent - it may also be referred to as chemo/radiotherapy); or iv) alternating with radiotherapy.<BR/>
<BR/>The locoregional control of the primary tumour is the main criterion of successful treatment. Tumours are excised with a margin of clinically normal tissue (this can be typically a margin of between 1 and 2 centimetres in the UK). Despite this apparent complete clinical surgical excision, the tumour may still be demonstrated at the margins histopathologically; this has prognostic implications (<LINK REF="REF-Batsakis-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Batsakis 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sutton-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sutton 2003</LINK>). Margins apparently histologically free of tumour may demonstrate molecular changes and the presence of such tumour clonogen populations at the margins may be predictive for disease progression (<LINK REF="REF-Partridge-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Partridge 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>Spread of the tumour to the regional lymph nodes within the neck (cervical nodes) is an early and consistent event in the natural history of oral and oropharyngeal cancers (<LINK REF="REF-Haddadin-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haddadin 2000</LINK>). The extent of cervical involvement is reflected in the staging of the tumour and has prognostic implications (<LINK REF="REF-Shah-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shah 1990</LINK>). Therefore, surgical dissection of the cervical lymph nodes at risk of metastasis may be undertaken as part of the management of the primary tumour. The classic radical neck dissections removed all of the cervical lymph nodes from levels I to V combined with the sternocleidomastoid muscle, internal jugular vein, submandibular gland and the spinal accessory nerve with resultant significant postoperative morbidity. This is now only reserved for advanced neck disease. Modifications of the neck dissection to preserve some or all of the associated structures have reduced morbidity and may now be undertaken as selective neck dissections (<LINK REF="REF-Carew-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carew 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Robbins-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Robbins 2002</LINK>). There has been an increasing trend in using the selective neck dissection as a therapeutic procedure in the clinically N0 neck (nodal status - no palpable nodes). In addition to the extent of neck disease at presentation, spread of the tumour out with the capsule of the lymph nodes (extracapsular spread) has also been shown to be a poor prognostic indicator (<LINK REF="REF-Woolgar-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Woolgar 2003</LINK>). Historically clinicians treating oral cancer have not focused on distant metastatic disease. This has been because locoregional control had been the main cause of death and there were also less effective chemotherapeutic agents to deal with distant metastases. With improvements in locoregional control distant metastases are an increasing issue in the management of oral cancer.</P>
<P>When small tumours (T1, less than 2 centimetres or T2, 2 to 4 centimetres) present with apparently clinically negative neck nodes, there is controversy over the management of the cervical lymph nodes (<LINK REF="REF-Woolgar-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Woolgar 2003</LINK>). Studies have demonstrated an improved outcome when a neck dissection has been undertaken at the same time as the resection of the primary tumour rather than waiting for neck disease to present subsequently (<LINK REF="REF-Haddadin-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haddadin 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hughes-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hughes 1993</LINK>) although others adopt a 'wait and see' policy. In cancer of the tongue the thickness of the tumour reflects the risk of nodal metastasis (<LINK REF="REF-Pentenero-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pentenero 2005</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="2">Why it is important to do this review</HEADING>
<P>The management of advanced oral cavity and oropharyngeal cancers is problematic and has traditionally relied on surgery and radiotherapy, both of which are associated with substantial adverse effects. Although there have been new treatments developed there has been limited improvement in survival over the past 3 decades (<LINK REF="REF-Warnakulasuriya-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Warnakulasuriya 2009</LINK>). Oropharyngeal cancers have relatively 'silent' symptoms which may not be present during the early stages of the disease, which is a possible explanation for the fact that stage of disease at diagnosis has not altered in the past 40 years despite public education (<LINK REF="REF-McGurk-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">McGurk 2005</LINK>). Tumour recurrence and the development of multiple primary tumours are the major causes of treatment failure (<LINK REF="REF-Day-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Day 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Partridge-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Partridge 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Woolgar-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Woolgar 2003</LINK>). Surgical treatment may be disfiguring and result in a substantially reduced quality of life as patients are socially isolated, due to difficulties with altered appearance, speech, eating and drinking. Developments in the way in which surgery is delivered aim to improve its efficacy and reduce the impact on patients' quality of life.</P>
<P>This review is undertaken as part of a series of reviews looking at the different treatment modalities of oral cancer (<LINK REF="REF-Furness-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Furness 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Glenny-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glenny 2010</LINK>). These reviews have been categorised into four intervention groups: surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy and immunotherapy. For this surgical review we will aim to answer the broad questions 'Does surgery, in addition to chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy, improve the outcomes for patients with oral cavity and oropharyngeal cancers?' and 'Which type of surgery improves the outcomes for patients with oral cavity and oropharyngeal cancers?'.</P>
<P>For this surgical review we will include all randomised controlled trials where more than 50% of participants included have primary tumours in the oral cavity or oropharynx. Only trials where patients in each treatment arm receive different surgical interventions (either different techniques or timing), or radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy plus or minus surgery, or surgery versus no surgery will be included.</P>

<P>Surgical treatment of the primary tumour is typically one of the primary treatment interventions. Surgical treatment could include traditional scalpel based surgery, laser cutting or ablation, or harmonic scalpel. Surgical treatment could have been compared to other surgical interventions, or to different treatment modalities such as radiotherapy, chemotherapy, immunotherapy/biotherapy with or without surgery; any combinations were considered providing they were compared to surgery in at least one arm of the study. Salvage surgery and palliative surgery were not considered in this review.</P>
<P>Surgical treatment of the neck lymph nodes (cervical lymph nodes) could have preceded, occurred simultaneously with or subsequent to the surgical treatment of the primary tumour. When there was no treatment of the primary tumour but only surgical treatment of the cervical lymph nodes these studies were not considered. Studies concerned with cervical lymph node management in the surgical treatment of the primary tumour were included. The treatments received and compared must have been the primary treatment for the tumour and patients should not have received any prior intervention other than diagnostic biopsy.<BR/>

<P>This review is part of a series of Cochrane reviews on the treatment modalities for treating oral cavity and oropharyngeal cancer. The reviews have been broadly divided into four themes concerning: surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy or immunotherapy/targeted therapies. A search strategy was developed that would encompass three of the four broad themes simultaneously (surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy) and further adapted for use in the following databases (date of the most recent searches as indicated):<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>MEDLINE via OVID (1950 to 17 February 2011) (<LINK REF="APP-01" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 1</LINK>);</LI>
<LI>The Cochrane Oral Health Group's Trials Register (to 17 February 2011) (<LINK REF="APP-02" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 2</LINK>);</LI>

<LI>EMBASE via OVID (1980 to 17 February 2011) (<LINK REF="APP-04" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 4</LINK>).</LI>
</UL>
<P>As studies involving oral cancer are often included with those of the head and neck, a broad search was undertaken to include all possible studies. The searches attempted to identify all relevant trials irrespective of language. Papers not in English were data extracted/translated by members of The Cochrane Collaboration. Trials were excluded if it was not possible to translate them into the English language. The reference lists of relevant articles were searched and authors were contacted in order to identify unpublished or ongoing trials.</P>
<P>Sensitive search strategies were developed for each database using a combination of free text and MeSH terms; these were based on the search strategy developed for MEDLINE (<LINK REF="APP-01" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 1</LINK>) but revised appropriately for each database. The search strategy combined the subject search with the Cochrane Highly Sensitive Search Strategy (CHSSS) for identifying randomised trials in MEDLINE: sensitivity maximising version (2009 revision) as referenced in Chapter 6.4.11.1 and detailed in box 6.4.c of the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> Version 5.1.0 (updated March 2011) (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). The search of EMBASE was linked to the Cochrane Oral Health Group filter for identifying RCTs in this database (<LINK REF="APP-04" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 4</LINK>). Only handsearching carried out by The Cochrane Collaboration is included in the search (<I>see</I> master list <A HREF="http://www.cochrane.org">www.cochrane.org</A>).The reference lists of related reviews and all articles obtained were checked for further trials. Authors of trial reports and specialists in the field known to the review authors were written to concerning further published and unpublished trials.</P>

<P>Data were extracted by two review authors independently using specially designed data extraction forms. The data extraction forms were piloted on several papers and modified as required before use. Any disagreements were discussed and a third review author consulted where necessary.

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2011-07-04 14:07:09 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>For the studies included in this review, assessment of risk of bias was conducted independently by at least two review authors using the Cochrane risk of bias assessment tool (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). We assessed six domains for each included study: sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding (of patient, carer, outcome assessor), completeness of outcome data, risk of selective outcome reporting and risk of other potential sources of bias. An overall risk of bias assessment was also made.</P>
<P>For this systematic review we assessed risk of bias according to the following.</P>
<UL>
<LI>Sequence generation: use of a random number table, use of a computerised system, central randomisation by statistical co-ordinating centre, randomisation by an independent service using minimisation technique, permuted block allocation or Zelan technique. If the paper merely stated randomised or randomly allocated with no further information this was assessed as being unclear.</LI>
<LI>Allocation concealment: centralised allocation including access by telephone call or fax, or pharmacy-controlled randomisation, sequentially numbered, sealed, opaque envelopes.</LI>
<LI>Blinding: unless the trial was specifically described as double blind, or there was a statement about blinding in the methods section of the paper it was assumed that blinding of patients, clinical staff and outcome assessors did not occur due to lack of feasibility.</LI>
<LI>Outcome data: outcome data were considered complete if all patients randomised were included in the analysis of the outcome(s). However, in trials of treatment for cancer this is rarely the case. Trials where less than 10% of those randomised were excluded from the analysis, and where reasons for exclusions were described for each group, and where both numbers and reasons were similar in each group, were assessed as being at low risk of bias due to incomplete outcome assessment. Where post-randomisation exclusions were greater than 10%, or reasons were not given for exclusions from each group, or where rates and reasons were different for each group, the risk of bias due to (in)complete outcome data was assessed as unclear.</LI>
<LI>Selective outcome reporting: a trial was assessed as being at low risk of bias due to selective outcome reporting if the outcomes of interest described in the methods section, were systematically reported in the results section. Where reported outcomes did not include those outcomes specified or expected in trials of treatments for oral cancer, or where additional analyses were reported this domain was assessed as unclear.</LI>
<LI>Other bias: imbalance in potentially important prognostic factors between the treatment groups at baseline, or the use of a co-intervention in only one group (for example nasogastric feeding) are examples of potential sources of bias noted.</LI>

<EFFECT_MEASURES MODIFIED="2011-05-27 21:59:25 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The primary outcome is total mortality expressed as a hazard ratio (it is acknowledged that it is preferable to talk in terms of overall survival, however, statistically the estimate of effect is the hazard ratio of death). These data were entered into the meta-analysis using the inverse variance method. If hazard ratios were not quoted in studies, we calculated the log hazard ratio and the standard error (SE) from the available summary statistics or Kaplan-Meier curves, according to the methods proposed by Parmar et al (<LINK REF="REF-Parmar-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parmar 1998</LINK>), or these data were requested from authors.</P>

There were differences between the two studies with regard to patient characteristics at baseline and surgical procedures so meta-analysis was not undertaken.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-BHNCSG-1998" TYPE="STUDY">BHNCSG 1998</LINK> compared a modified classical neck dissection procedure with accessory nerve preservation, to a supraomohyoid neck dissection (SOH) to achieve a compartmental excision of levels I to III neck nodes in 148 patients with T2 to T4 primary lesions in the oral cavity and clinically negative necks. Frozen sections were carried out on the nodes during surgery and 3 patients in the SOH group who were found to have histologically positive nodes then underwent the modified classical neck dissection instead.

<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Bier-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Bier 1994</LINK> 104 patients with either clinically negative or positive but movable, neck nodes were randomised to either radical neck dissection or a selective neck dissection where the platysma, the sternocleidomastoid muscle, the internal jugular vein and the accessory nerve were left in place. Primary tumours were in the oral cavity and the study was assessed at high risk of bias.</P>
<P>There is no evidence from these two trials of a difference in overall survival, disease free survival or disease recurrence between the radical or more selective neck dissection surgery (<LINK REF="CMP-002.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.1</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-002.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.2</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-002.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.3</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Comparison 3: Radiotherapy plus surgery versus radiotherapy alone</HEADING>
<P>One trial compared surgery plus postoperative radiotherapy with radiotherapy alone (<LINK REF="STD-Robertson-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Robertson 1998</LINK>). Those in the surgery group had wide local excision of the primary tumour together with either a radical neck dissection or a more selective neck dissection at the discretion of the surgeon. It was planned to accrue 175 patients to each arm of the trial but after 35 patients had been recruited the trial was stopped due to the high death rate in the radiotherapy alone arm. Data in <LINK REF="CMP-003.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.1</LINK> are from an interim analysis of 35 participants after 23 months and show a hazard ratio for total mortality of 0.24 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.10 to 0.59), favouring the surgery group. This estimate should be interpreted with extreme caution for a number of reasons. The authors state that "the difference in survival is likely to be inflated" due to the small number of participants in the analysis, the fact that only 41% of patients in the radiotherapy only arm received their radiotherapy as planned due to problems with machine breakdown/servicing, and that there were a number of other protocol violations in the trial. In the surgery plus radiotherapy arm of this trial 50% of the patients received their radiotherapy as planned, but 12% of participants in this group received neither surgery to the mandible nor neck dissection.</P>
<P>The following severe acute side effects were reported in both groups (<LINK REF="STD-Robertson-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Robertson 1998</LINK>): subcutaneous fibrosis, telangiectasia (1 to 4 cm²), and moderate to severe oedema, xerostomia, trismus and dysphagia. Subcutaneous fibrosis was reported as more prevalent in the surgery plus radiotherapy group (P = 0.042), but the prevalence of other side effects appeared to be similar in each group.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2011-07-04 14:21:32 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This systematic review was undertaken to answer the question 'Does treatment with surgery improve the outcomes for patients with oral cavity and oropharyngeal cancers?'. There were seven randomised controlled trials (RCTs) included in this review with a combined total of 669 patients randomised. All but two of these patients had oral cavity cancers. None of the trials were at low risk of bias.</P>
<P>None of the included trials compared different surgical approaches to the removal of the primary tumour. Four of the included trials evaluated the timing of neck dissection surgery in the course of treatment and two included trials evaluated the extent of neck dissection.</P>
<UL>
<LI>Four trials compared elective neck dissection surgery undertaken at the same time as excision of the primary tumour with the option of excision of the primary alone, followed by subsequent neck dissection surgery if and when neck nodes showed clinical signs of cancer (therapeutic neck dissection). All patients had oral cavity cancers, specifically tongue or floor of mouth tumours, and clinically negative neck nodes. One trial showed a difference in overall survival and disease free survival after three and a half years of follow-up, favouring elective SOH neck dissection compared to therapeutic neck dissection. In two trials where the elective procedure was a radical neck dissection there was no difference between the elective and therapeutic groups with regard to either overall or disease free survival. The fourth trial in this group did not report overall or disease free survival. There is some evidence from that locoregional disease recurrence is reduced following elective neck resection, but data were unsuitable for meta-analysis.</LI>
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>A further two trials, compared elective radical (comprehensive) neck dissection with a selective neck dissection in patients with oral cavity cancers. One trial included only patients with clinically negative neck nodes and the other included those with movable positive neck nodes as well. There is no evidence from these two trials of a difference in overall survival between the two types of surgery, and in the single trial that reported disease free survival and disease recurrence there was no difference between the two types of surgery.</LI>
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>The third comparison was between surgery plus postoperative radiotherapy and radiotherapy alone but the only trial in this comparison was stopped early due to an unacceptably high death rate in the radiotherapy alone group. There was a difference in overall survival favouring the surgery plus radiotherapy group. These results should be interpreted with caution because the nature of the interim analysis on 35 patients (10% of planned recruitment) may inflate the difference between the groups. Also there were a number of protocol violations (more than half of the participants did not receive their radiotherapy as planned due to machine breakdown/servicing) which may partially explain the poor outcome in the radiotherapy alone group.</LI>
</UL>
<P>While there is weak evidence from these included trials that early or extensive dissection of the lymph nodes in the clinically negative neck reduces locoregional recurrence, there is no strong evidence of a difference in overall survival, or disease free survival. There is no information from these trials on quality of life of the patients who have undergone the different neck dissection procedures.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2011-07-04 14:22:33 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review originally sought to evaluate the benefits of all surgical treatment modalities used alone or in conjunction with other treatment regimens such as radiotherapy, chemotherapy and radiotherapy. However, this led to multiple treatment comparisons of studies that did not necessarily differ purely on the surgical treatment method. This review is one of a series of reviews in oral cancer looking at surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy and immunotherapy. Therefore for this update, the protocol for this review was modified to only include studies where different surgical treatment modalities were directly compared against one another, or surgery was compared to a different treatment regimen such as radiotherapy, chemotherapy or immunotherapy. All other studies were removed from the updated review, and where appropriate were incorporated into the other oral cancer reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Furness-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Furness 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Glenny-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glenny 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>The inclusion criteria for this review specified that trials of surgery where participants had either oral cavity or oropharyngeal cancer would be included. However for this update of the review only seven trials were identified and 667 of the total of 669 participants in these trials had oral cavity cancers, most commonly in either the tongue or floor of mouth. The trials, each including between 35 and 167 participants, recruited patients over four decades between 1966 and 2004. There have been significant developments in both the surgical and adjuvant treatments for oral cavity cancer patients over the past decade and these are incompletely evaluated in this systematic review due to the lack of randomised controlled trials in this condition. It is encouraging to note that there are currently three large trials ongoing (<LINK REF="STD-NCT00193765" TYPE="STUDY">NCT00193765</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-NCT01334320" TYPE="STUDY">NCT01334320</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-NCT00571883-_x0028_SEND_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">NCT00571883 (SEND)</LINK>) which will provide further information concerning the benefits and harms of different surgical options for neck dissection in oral cavity cancer patients.</P>
<P>Only two of the included studies reported harms or adverse events to treatment (<LINK REF="STD-BHNCSG-1998" TYPE="STUDY">BHNCSG 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Robertson-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Robertson 1998</LINK>) but neither presented outcomes per person. Aggressive surgery to remove the cancer and reduce the risk of recurrence has been associated with very significant adverse effects on both appearance and functions such as breathing, speech and swallowing. Less aggressive surgery, such as selective lymph node dissection is associated with a greater risk of recurrence, but preservation of function and appearance. Incorporation of quality of life outcomes into randomised trials is essential if the true benefits and harms of different types of surgery are to be evaluated. It is noteworthy that while some of the trials included in this review reported that some patients, randomly allocated to surgery, refused surgical treatment and were withdrawn from the trials, there is no report of the quality of life of these patients compared to those included in the trials.</P>
<P>We did not identify any trials of surgery in patients with oropharyngeal cancer, probably because the current therapeutic approach to oropharyngeal cancer is either radiotherapy or chemoradiotherapy. Over the past decade the percentage of patients with oropharyngeal cancer who test positive for human papilloma virus (HPV) has increased steadily. It is now recognised that HPV status of patients with oropharyngeal cancer is an important factor in their prognosis (<LINK REF="REF-Adelstein-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Adelstein 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Brizel-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brizel 2011</LINK>).</P>

<P>The overall quality of the evidence included in this systematic review is poor. All of the included trials were at either high or unclear risk of bias. Patients were recruited over 4 decades. For objective outcomes such as total mortality, trials assessed as adequate with regard to the domains of sequence generation, allocation concealment, complete outcome data and absence of selective reporting, were planned to be assessed as being at low risk of bias. None of the included studies met all these criteria. None of the trials included in this systematic review used, or reported using, blinding of either the participants or the outcome assessors. It is recognised that blinding is difficult to maintain in trials of surgery and it may not be either possible or indeed ethical, to blind trial participants. It is likely that many outcome assessments are performed by the clinicians treating the patients.</P>
<P>There has been substantial development in the surgical and non-surgical treatments for both oral and oropharyngeal cancers over recent years. Further objective assessments of current surgical treatments for these cancers are needed in order to inform both patients and clinicians about the benefits and risks of different treatments.</P>

<LINK REF="REF-Fasunla-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fasunla 2011</LINK> reviewed four RCTs and reported the dichotomous outcome of disease-specific death after approximately 3 years of follow-up. This review found that the risk ratio (RR) of disease specific death favoured elective neck dissection (RR 0.57; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.36 to 0.89).</P>
<P>We have chosen to use the outcome of overall survival/total mortality because we believe this is the more important outcome for patients, and we have used hazard ratios where possible, as they have the advantage of incorporating all available information, including data from patients who fail to complete the trial, in the outcome. We look forward to the addition of data from the three ongoing trials identified to the next update of this review.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2011-07-04 14:25:26 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The trials included in this review do not address different surgical approaches to removal of the primary tumour. From the four trials of patients with oral cavity cancers there is no strong evidence that elective dissection of clinically negative neck nodes compared to therapeutic neck dissection results in better or worse overall survival or disease free survival. From two trials there is no evidence that radical neck dissection results in better or worse overall survival or disease free survival compared to selective neck dissection. However elective neck dissection does reduce locoregional recurrence. More information about the effects of these surgeries on patients' quality of life is required in order to fully assess the benefits and harms of these surgical procedures.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2011-06-27 11:36:26 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We would make the following recommendations for future research involving the surgical treatment of oral or oropharyngeal tumours.</P>
<P>(1) Trialists are encouraged to follow the CONSORT guidelines when reporting on their trials. Ideally trials should report hazard ratios with 95% confidence intervals for survival data, or present data that allows for the calculation of this estimate of effect.<BR/>(2) Health-related quality of life is an important outcome measure that should be integral to all trials of oral cavity and oropharyngeal cancers.<BR/>(3) There should be a standardised and consistent reporting of adverse events and morbidity associated with treatment, with results reported per patient.<BR/>(4) Future trials of oral cavity and oropharyngeal cancers should report data based on the location of the primary tumour.<BR/>

<P>Types of interventions: The intervention under evaluation must be surgery. Trials where all participants receive the same surgical regimen and are randomised to other treatments were excluded.</P>
<P>Search methods: The search strategy has been updated.</P>
<P>Quality assessment has been replaced by the new risk of bias tool (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>Data synthesis has been updated. The primary outcome is total mortality expressed as a hazard ratio. For dichotomous outcomes, the estimates of effect of an intervention were expressed as risk ratios together with 95% confidence intervals. Dichotomous data were only used for primary outcomes where hazard ratios were unavailable or could not be calculated.</P>
