<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2011-11-22 12:25:38 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Long-term poor blood flow in the leg veins, also known as chronic venous insufficiency (CVI), is a chronic illness. It occurs when the veins in the leg cannot return blood to the heart, resulting in increased blood pressure in the legs. The term CVI encompasses a wide spectrum of symptoms including feelings of heaviness in the legs, itching, tingling, cramps, pain, oedema (swellings), varicose veins, skin pigmentation, signs of skin atrophy and venous ulceration.</P>
<P>CVI causes considerable discomfort, which in turn has a significant impact on ability to work. It is a common condition particularly among people who are required to stand at work. Non-pharmacological interventions such as compression stockings or cushioned flooring and strategies such as taking rest breaks or doing exercises have been postulated to be effective in the prevention of CVI in standing workers. Yet the true effect of such interventions is relatively unknown. One cross-over trial of 19 female flight attendants who were required to stand, almost continuously, for long periods of time, and who did not have any symptoms of CVI at the start of the study, were included in this review.</P>
<P>The trial finding suggested that compression stockings did reduce symptoms associated with CVI including aching of the legs, discomfort, fatigue, swelling and tiredness. However, this evidence was from a very small study. Due to the extremely limited number of trials available, we could not assess the effectiveness of other non-pharmacological interventions in the prevention of this condition. Nor could we ascertain if any intervention had an effect on quality of life or an economic impact such as reducing the number of days of sick leave or work disability. Further research that looks at a broad range of proposed interventions in a clearly defined standing worker population is required.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2013-09-30 12:25:07 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) is a common problem, affecting up to 50% of the population in industrialised countries. It is a chronic condition which, if untreated, can progress to serious complications that in turn can interfere with working ability.

<P>Randomised and non-randomised controlled trials that recruited standing workers to evaluate non-pharmacological devices or strategies used to prevent CVI were eligible for inclusion.

<P>Selection of the trials, quality assessment and data abstraction were completed independently by two review authors. We resolved disagreements by discussion. Only one trial was eligible for inclusion in the review so we did not perform meta-analyses.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-09-30 12:25:07 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The primary outcomes of this review were clinical features of CVI and its associated symptoms. No new included studies were identified for this update. One prospective cross-over trial was included in this review. It measured the effect of no compression followed by two phases with different gradients of compression stockings on symptoms in 19 female flight attendants who were required to stand, almost continuously, for long periods of time. The included study provided some evidence that compression stockings improved symptoms of leg fatigue in standing workers. However, the strength of the evidence in this review is weak as it is based on only one very small trial which was at high risk of bias. The included study did not address any of the secondary outcomes including quality of life or economic impact of the interventions. Nor did the study report the length of time that the population were required to stand at work. Furthermore, no trials were found which measured the effectiveness of other non-pharmacological interventions or strategies aimed at preventing CVI in standing workers.</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2011-11-04 11:10:03 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Due to the extremely limited number of trials, there is insufficient evidence to draw any conclusions about the effectiveness of non-pharmacological interventions for preventing CVI in standing workers.

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2011-11-16 22:03:09 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) is a widespread problem. The prevalence in industrial countries is estimated to be as high as 50% in the general population (<LINK REF="REF-Beebe_x002d_Dimmer-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beebe-Dimmer 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Callam-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Callam 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Evans-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Evans 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pannier_x002d_Fischer-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pannier-Fischer 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rabe-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rabe 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Scuderi-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scuderi 2002</LINK>). However, the variation in the reported prevalence is very large, which may be partly due to differences in the definition of venous insufficiency and in the methods used for assessment of the clinical signs and symptoms of chronic insufficiency. In 1994, an International Consensus was formed to define and classify venous disease in a standardised manner (<LINK REF="REF-Porter-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Porter 1995</LINK>). The classification was based on the clinical signs (C), etiology (E), anatomical distribution (A) and physiological conditions (P), known as CEAP. Prior to the CEAP classification, there was no standard definition of CVI, which accounts for the wide variation in the prevalence of CVI reported in earlier studies.</P>
<P>Chronic venous insufficiency is characterised by chronic, inadequate drainage of venous blood and venous hypertension in the legs. As a result of the increased venous pressure, symptoms such as leg oedema (swelling) and dermatosclerosis (hardening of the skin) often manifest along with feelings of pain, itching, fatigue and<B> </B>tenseness<B> </B>in the lower extremities. Diagnosis of CVI is based on patient history, clinical examination and specific diagnostic tests such as Doppler ultrasound. Image-directed doppler ultrasound is used to determine the exact site of valvular incompetence and is widely recognised as the method of choice in diagnosing CVI of the lower limb (<LINK REF="REF-Gaitini-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gaitini 1994</LINK>).</P>
<P>The prevalence of CVI is higher in females than in males and depends on race, family history, parity (the number of children to which a woman has given birth) and a standing or sitting occupation (<LINK REF="REF-Fowkes-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fowkes 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jawien-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jawien 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Krijnen-1997b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Krijnen 1997b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pannier_x002d_Fischer-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pannier-Fischer 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>In occupational health, physicians are often confronted with populations of workers who have to stand for several hours a day. Standing is a risk factor for CVI of the lower limb because of the increased hydrostatic pressure and diminished activity of the calf muscle during standing. The prevalence of CVI has been estimated to be about 30% to 40% in the standing industrial population (<LINK REF="REF-Flore-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Flore 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Krijnen-1997a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Krijnen 1997a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tomei-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tomei 1999</LINK>). However, prevalence of CVI in the general population is higher than in the industrial population because the incidence increases with age and, generally, the age limit of the industrial population is 65 years. A key issue in measuring symptoms in a standing worker population is the duration of time spent standing at work. This a continuing source of debate and clarification is required before meaningful conclusions can be drawn from the populations studied.</P>
<P>Venous insufficiency is a chronic illness with a slow progression. Initially, it seems only a cosmetic problem. In later stages, CVI can cause symptoms that can interfere with working ability. In the study of Krijnen (<LINK REF="REF-Krijnen-1997a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Krijnen 1997a</LINK>) 7% of the males with a standing occupation had been temporarily unfit for work because of venous disorders.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2011-11-16 22:05:53 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The most commonly used treatment for CVI is compression stockings. Another strategy is to avoid prolonged standing. This can be done by providing alternative postures for those who stand at work, including the use of chairs or rails for resting the feet, or by taking regular rest breaks with active movements and exercises. If this is not possible, other options are to adapt the workplace itself by installing specially designed resilient surfaces, including softer flooring and cushioned mats, or by wearing shoe inserts.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2011-11-16 22:07:50 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Stockings decrease the effects of the hydrostatic pressure and, if used while walking, help the effects of the calf muscle pump function. Soft-shoe soles and floor mats stimulate the calf muscle pump function.</P>
<P>There are also preventive measures, where standing and other postures are varied, that can diminish the hydrostatic pressure and increase the use of the calf muscle during work hours.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2013-09-30 12:25:07 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>A systematic review on this topic is very useful because CVI is a common problem that can lead to severe complications. These complications can in turn have a huge economic impact both in terms of provision of healthcare resources and days off work due to disability. Several reviews have examined the treatment of CVI with compression stockings (<LINK REF="REF-Amsler-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Amsler 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Meara-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Meara 2012</LINK>) and various drugs (<LINK REF="REF-Martinez_x002d_Zapata-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Martinez-Zapata 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pittler-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pittler 2012</LINK>) but none have examined interventions for standing workers. Many preventive strategies that could be readily available and administered with relative ease have been proposed, yet the true efficacy of such non-pharmacological interventions is unknown. This is an update of a review first published in 2012 (<LINK REF="REF-Robertson-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Robertson 2012</LINK>).</P>

<P>The included study was a prospective cross-over trial of 19 female flight attendants who had no symptoms of CVI and were required to stand, almost continuously, for long periods of time (<LINK REF="STD-Weiss-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Weiss 1999</LINK>). All participants were asked not to wear any compression hose for a period of two weeks prior to the study. Participants then wore 8 to 15 mmHg compression stockings over a four-week period (Phase 1) before wearing 15 to 20 mmHg compression stockings over another four-week period (Phase 2), with a minimum period of two weeks between Phases 1 and 2. Participants completed questionnaires at the beginning of the trial following no compression, and then again after Phases 1 and 2. Participants rated their leg symptoms, including fatigue, ache, discomfort, tightness and swelling, on a visual analogue scale ranging from none (0) to severe (5). Eighteen of the 19 participants self-reported having spider or varicose veins, subsequently confirmed by physical examination. None of the participants had clinical evidence of CVI upon examination.</P>

In the study by <LINK REF="STD-Derman-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Derman 1989</LINK>, only 61% of participants spent at least five hours per day on their feet. Data were not presented according to time spent standing and therefore this study was excluded from the review. The second study by <LINK REF="STD-Kraemer-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Kraemer 2000</LINK> looked at the physiological effects of compression in women who did not stand at work but simply had to follow four different standing protocols for the duration of the study. In the third excluded study participants were not standing workers but were included on the basis of having C2-C5 CVI (<LINK REF="STD-Mosti-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Mosti 2011</LINK>). Finally the fourth excluded study was not a controlled clinical trial (<LINK REF="STD-Flore-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Flore 2007</LINK>). The four different groups of participants all had different occupations and the length of time that they stood on their feet varied within each of the groups.

<P>The primary outcomes of this review were clinical features of CVI and complaints of its associated symptoms. We found only one study which met the inclusion criteria. Whilst it did not measure the effects of CVI, it did examine changes in leg symptoms that are associated with CVI. As only one study was found, pooling of data and meta-analyses were not possible, so individual estimates from the study are reported in the narrative synthesis.</P>
<P>The included study measured the effect of no compression versus two different gradients of compression on symptoms of CVI. The number of participants who reported symptoms and improvements following each phase of the study are shown in <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>. Results showed that wearing 8 to 15 mmHg compression stockings resulted in a significant improvement in leg symptoms. Individually, discomfort, aching and fatigue were improved with statistically significant effects (P &lt; 0.001); swelling and tightness also improved but to a lesser although statistically significant degree (P &lt; 0.01). The study demonstrated that wearing 15 to 20 mmHg compression stockings also improved symptoms in the leg although to a lesser extent. The heavier support stocking was most effective in reducing discomfort and aching (P &lt; 0.01). Tightness and fatigue also showed a statistically significant improvement (P &lt; 0.05) with the 15 to 20 mmHg stocking but swelling did not show any statistically significant improvement (P &gt; 0.05). The study found no significant difference between the two compression stockings.</P>
<P>The improvement in swelling and discomfort, as reflected by a reduction in the mean score assigned by participants, is shown in <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>. There was no significant difference in the reduction of symptoms between the two stockings although it should be noted that only 10/19 participants completed Phase 2.</P>
<P>The secondary outcomes of this review included number of days of sick leave or work disability due to CVI, change in outcomes of objective quantitative measures for CVI, outcomes for quality of life, economic impact and adverse effects of treatment. The included study did not, however, measure any of these secondary outcomes. Furthermore, as the one included study examined the effectiveness of compression stockings, other interventions outlined in this review are not discussed.</P>
<P>As only one study was deemed eligible for inclusion in this review, it was not possible to measure heterogeneity or publication bias. Furthermore, subgroup and sensitivity analyses could not be conducted.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2011-11-18 08:44:47 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Only one study was found which fulfilled the eligibility criteria for inclusion in this systematic review. The study was a prospective cross-over trial in 19 women who worked as flight attendants (<LINK REF="STD-Weiss-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Weiss 1999</LINK>) and measured changes in leg symptoms including aching, tiredness, discomfort, fatigue and swelling after wearing compression stockings. The participants had mild venous disease including spider or varicose veins but no symptoms of CVI. The fact that some participants had varicose veins would suggest that venous reflux was present, but this was not confirmed by ultrasound of the leg veins. Given that CVI can be related to reflux in the deep, superficial or perforating veins, it is impossible to determine if the symptoms reported by the population were attributed to CVI or were merely the result of the standing nature of the work undertaken in the population studied. The authors stated that the population studied were required to stand, almost continuously, for long periods of time. However, exact measurements on standing duration were not reported. Results of the study showed that wearing 8 to 15 mmHg compression stockings did improve all five symptoms to a statistically significant degree. Wearing a heavier weight compression stocking (15 to 20 mmHg) also improved some of the symptoms although to a lesser extent. When the two different compression stockings were compared, no difference was found with respect to improving symptoms.</P>
<P>No other studies on non-pharmacological interventions for the prevention of CVI met the inclusion criteria of this review.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2011-11-18 08:41:55 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is a severe lack of evidence regarding the use of non-pharmacological interventions to prevent CVI in standing workers. The one study in this review included female participants only, thus the little evidence available is only applicable to females. Furthermore, it would be useful to know about the reflux status in the population studied to determine if the symptoms reported were associated with development of CVI. Duration of standing at work is a key issue here, which has not been fully addressed by the authors. There is considerable debate about what constitutes standing occupations and this needs to be clarified in future studies.</P>
<P>With any cross-over trial, it is important to assess whether there is a likelihood of serious carry-over, where the effects of an intervention persist into a subsequent period (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2009b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2009b</LINK>). The cross-over trial included in this review involved three phases, the first phase comprising no compression and the latter two phases comprising two periods of different levels of compression. The authors did allow a minimum period of two weeks between the two phases of compression. However, no justification is provided as to why a wash-out period of two weeks was used. Therefore, it cannot be concluded that there was no carry-over effect between the lighter and heavier weight compression phases. In this case, evidence should be based on the first period, from no compression to 8 to 15 mmHg compression, where authors found that all five symptoms had improved to a statistically significant degree following the period of lighter weight compression.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2011-11-17 08:31:50 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The quality of reporting in the included study was poor. The study was very small and the risk of selection, attrition and reporting bias was determined to be high. Furthermore, the issue of accurately measuring subjective symptoms needs to be addressed. The simple act of applying compression could produce a subjective perception of therapeutic effect, causing the participant to feel that their condition had improved. This study addressed symptoms which could be attributed to CVI but could also be the result of standing for long periods of time. Definitive CVI symptoms according to the CEAP classification should have been measured and data on the length of time standing should have been reported.</P>

<P>None of the authors of this report were involved in any of the included or excluded studies. Furthermore, none have any commercial or other conflict of interest.</P>
<P>The search was as comprehensive as possible, and all studies were independently assessed for inclusion by two review authors. We are confident that we have included all relevant studies and attempted to reduce bias in the review process. However, the possibility remains that we may have missed studies which have not been published.</P>
</POTENTIAL_BIASES>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2013-09-25 11:32:59 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Three other systematic reviews have been conducted which have examined the effect of compression stockings on chronic venous disease (<LINK REF="REF-Amsler-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Amsler 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Meara-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Meara 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Palfreyman-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Palfreyman 2009</LINK>), however none have examined the effect in standing workers.</P>
<P>In a systematic review on the effectiveness of compression in the treatment of varicose veins, Palfreyman found that some studies did report an improvement in leg symptoms with compression (<LINK REF="REF-Palfreyman-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Palfreyman 2009</LINK>). However, this review did not address the issue of standing at work as a risk factor for development of CVI.</P>
<P>O'Meara conducted a systematic review on the clinical effectiveness of compression bandaging in the treatment of venous leg ulceration and concluded that ulcers healed more rapidly with compression than without, but this review was based on the healing rather than the prevention of CVI (<LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Meara-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Meara 2012</LINK>).</P>
<P>Finally, in a meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials examining compression therapy for leg symptoms and chronic venous disorders, compression was found to improve oedema and leg discomfort (<LINK REF="REF-Amsler-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Amsler 2008</LINK>), but this review included studies in which participants were not required to stand at work or they already had clinical signs of CVI.</P>
<P>Clearly, there is evidence that compression does improve the symptoms and healing of CVI. However, our review specifically examined the effect of compression in those who are required to stand at work, an issue which has not yet been addressed in other reviews.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2011-11-17 08:38:43 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>From the one study which met our inclusion criteria for this review, we found evidence that compression stockings do improve symptoms of leg fatigue in standing workers. However, this evidence is based on a very small underpowered study with a high risk of bias. Few studies have measured the effectiveness of other non-pharmacological interventions, such as floor mats or soft shoes, and strategies such as rest periods or exercises. Furthermore, other outcomes associated with interventions, such as adverse side effects, disability or quality of life, are unknown. Therefore, until adequate evidence regarding the efficacy and acceptability of interventions is available, definitive recommendations cannot be made.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2011-11-04 11:10:18 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The results of this systematic review confirm the necessity for methodologically sound and large sample studies to determine the effectiveness of non-pharmacological interventions in preventing CVI in standing workers. Future research should test the broad range of proposed interventions in order to find the most effective strategy and use the CEAP classification to measure symptoms of CVI. Moreover, the acceptability of such interventions needs to be measured and thus any future studies should analyse the secondary effects of such interventions, including number of days of sick leave, effect on quality of life and adverse side effects.</P>
