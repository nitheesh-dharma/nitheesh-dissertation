</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>A token economy is a behavioural therapy technique in which the desired change is achieved by means of tokens administered for the performance of predefined behaviours according to a program. Though token economy programmes were widespread in the 1970s they became largely restricted to wards where long-stay patients from institutions are prepared for transfer into the community and were particularly aimed at changing negative symptoms of schizophrenia - poor motivation, poor attention and social withdrawal.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To review the effects of token economies for people with schizophrenia, or other serious or chronic mental illnesses, compared with standard care.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>Electronic searches of Biological Abstracts (1985-1999), CINAHL (1982-1998), The Cochrane Library (Issue 1, 1999), The Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Register of Trials (February 1999), EMBASE (1980-1999) and PsycLIT (1987-1998) were supplemented with reference searches, personal contact with trial authors and hand searches.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomised studies comparing a token economy regime (one in which change is achieved by means of use of non-monetary, non-consumable tokens) to standard care for those with schizophrenia or any other similar chronic or serious mental illness.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Studies were reliably selected, quality rated and data extracted. For dichotomous data relative risk (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) was estimated. Where possible, the number needed to treat statistic (NNT) was also calculated. Analysis was by intention-to-treat. Normal continuous data were summated using the weighted mean difference (WMD). Scale data were presented only for those tools that had attained pre-specified levels of quality.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Only three randomised controlled trials could be included in the analyses (total n=110). There were no usable data on target or non-target behaviour. One small study favoured the token economy approach for the outcome 'change in mental state' on the SANS-CV with improvement in negative symptoms at three months (n=40, WMD -12.7, CI -21.44 to -3.96).</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>The token economy approach may have effects on negative symptoms but it is unclear if these results are reproducible, clinically meaningful and are maintained beyond the treatment programme. Token economy remains worthy of careful evaluation in well designed, conducted and reported randomised trials.</P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
</ABSTRACT>
<BODY MODIFIED="2008-11-11 14:09:08 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND>
<P>A token economy is a behavioural therapy technique in which the desired change is achieved by means of tokens administered for the performance of predefined behaviours according to a programme (<LINK REF="REF-Kazdin-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kazdin 1977</LINK>). Tokens are worth nothing in themselves but can be exchanged for something of value. The technique can potentially be used to change any behaviour. Token economy may be especially useful for people with schizophrenia, as there is evidence that they may be less responsive than normal to everyday social rewards such as praise (<LINK REF="REF-Layne-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Layne 1982</LINK>).</P>
<P>Token economies started to be used for large groups of people with schizophrenia in the 1960s (<LINK REF="REF-Slade-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Slade 1989</LINK>) and continued to be used in parallel with drugs, particularly on rehabilitation wards. Though token economy programmes were widespread in the 1970s (<LINK REF="REF-McReynolds-1972" TYPE="REFERENCE">McReynolds 1972</LINK>) they became largely restricted to wards where long-stay patients from institutions are prepared for transfer into the community. Token economies were particularly aimed at changing negative symptoms of schizophrenia - poor motivation, poor attention and social withdrawal. In this role they have come to be replaced, first by social and life skills training, and, more recently, by cognitive skills training (<LINK REF="REF-Slade-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Slade 1989</LINK>). It is unlikely that the new antipsychotic drugs will have as much impact on negative symptoms as was first hoped (<LINK REF="REF-Kennedy-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kennedy 1999</LINK>) so there will still be a place for the non-pharmacological approach to these troublesome symptoms.</P>
<P>It is therefore important to consider the possible effects and role of behavioural interventions such as token economy. Schizophrenia in particular remains an illness with a high level of treatment resistance, poor compliance and social disabilities, which affect the capacity for independent living (<LINK REF="REF-Harrison-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harrison 1996</LINK>). The use of token economy could still be considered in this group. Furthermore, the global use of token economy is unknown and may be more prevalent in less well-resourced mental health services (<LINK REF="STD-Li-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Li 1994</LINK>).</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>To review the effects of token economies for people with schizophrenia, or other serious or chronic mental illnesses, compared with standard care. It was intended that where different token economy programmes were compared these would also have been presented as separate comparisons of secondary interest.</P>
</OBJECTIVES>
<METHODS MODIFIED="2008-11-11 14:09:08 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2008-11-11 14:06:57 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CRIT_STUDIES>
<P>All relevant randomised controlled trials. Quasi-randomised studies, such as those allocating by day of the week, were excluded. Data from trials using block randomisation, such as using whole wards as the unit of randomisation, have been presented but not added to data from studies randomising individuals. Where people were given additional treatments within a token economy trial, data were only included if the adjunct treatment was evenly distributed between groups and it was only token economy that was randomised.</P>
</CRIT_STUDIES>
<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>People with schizophrenia or any other chronic mental illness, diagnosed by any criteria, irrespective of gender or age. Where possible, studies including those with organic mental illness or dual diagnosis (serious mental illness and substance misuse) were excluded.</P>
</CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>1. Token economy: one in which it is hoped to achieve change by means of use of non-monetary, non-consumable tokens. These tokens are given, as rewards, for behaviour that is specified in advance. The tokens must be of no value in themselves, but can be exchanged for a variety of goods and privileges.</P>
<P>2. Standard care: the normal level of psychiatric care provided in the area where the trial was conducted.</P>
</CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<CRIT_OUTCOMES MODIFIED="2008-11-11 14:06:57 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Outcomes of interest were:<BR/>1. Target behaviours<BR/>1.1 Continuation of target behaviour<BR/>1.2 Relapse of target behaviour<BR/>1.3 Clinically significant changes in target behaviours as defined by the study<BR/>1.4 Degree of change in target behaviour</P>
<P>Where possible all data relating to any behaviour were summated. In addition, however, dangerous and non-dangerous behaviours were also presented separately.</P>
<P>2. Changes in behaviour other than target behaviour<BR/>2.1 Continuation of behaviour other than target behaviour<BR/>2.2 Relapse of behaviour other than target behaviour<BR/>2.3 Clinically significant changes in behaviour other than target behaviour<BR/>2.4 Degree of change in behaviour other than target behaviour</P>

<OTHER_SEARCHES MODIFIED="2008-11-11 14:09:08 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>1. Reference lists<BR/>Examination of references cited in all included trials were searched in order to identify any missing studies.</P>
<P>2. Personal contact<BR/>The authors of all studies initially selected for inclusion were contacted in order to identify further relevant trials.</P>
<P>3. Hand searching<BR/>High yield journals were identified by electronic searches and, if available and not already hand searched, one was to have been chosen for full page by page inspection.</P>
</OTHER_SEARCHES>
</SEARCH_METHODS>
<DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>1. Study selection<BR/>All reports were inspected by the principal reviewer (TM) and re-inspected by AS in order to ensure reliable selection. Where disagreement occurred this was resolved by discussion or, if doubt remained, the full article was acquired for further inspection. Once the full articles were obtained TM and AS, again working independently, decided whether they met the criteria for inclusion. Again, when disputes arose, resolution was attempted by discussion but if this was not possible data were not entered and the trial was allocated to the list of those awaiting assessment whilst authors were contacted. <BR/>
<BR/>2. Assessment of methodological quality<BR/>Trials were allocated to three quality categories, as described in the Cochrane Collaboration Handbook (<LINK REF="REF-Clarke-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clarke 2000</LINK>) by each reviewer. When disputes arose as to which category a trial was allocated, again, resolution was attempted by discussion. When this was not possible and further information was necessary to clarify into which category to allocate the trial, data was not entered and the trial was allocated to the list of those awaiting assessment. Only trials in Category A or B were included in the review. </P>
<P>3. Data collection<BR/>Data from selected trials were independently extracted by TM and AS. When disputes arose resolution was attempted by discussion. When this was not possible and further information was necessary to resolve the dilemma, data were not entered and this outcome of the trial was added to the list of those awaiting assessment.</P>
<P>4. Data synthesis<BR/>4.1 Incomplete data<BR/>Recognising that most token economy programmes operate on long-stay psychiatric wards the reviewers felt that attrition of &gt;30% would call into question the value of the study. Studies losing more than 30% of people when reporting relevant outcomes were excluded.</P>
<P>4.2 Dichotomous (yes/no) data<BR/>4.2.1 Statistics: for binary outcomes, for example, target behaviour significantly reduced or not, relative risk (RR), with the 95% confidence interval (CI) was estimated, using a random effects model. Where possible, the weighted number needed to treat statistic (NNT) was calculated.</P>
<P>4.2.2 Intention to treat: where possible, data were presented on a 'once-randomised-always-analyse' basis. Where people were lost to follow-up it was assumed, with the exception of death, that they had had a poor outcome. This assumption was tested in a sensitivity analysis.</P>
<P>4.3 Continuous data<BR/>4.3.1 Intention to treat: in the case of continuous data 'completer' analysis was presented.</P>
<P>4.3.2 Normal data: mental health continuous data is often not normally distributed. To avoid the pitfall of applying parametric tests to non-parametric data the following standards were applied to all continuous data before inclusion: (i) standard deviations or standard errors and means were reported in the paper or were obtainable from the authors; (ii) when a continuous measure starts from a finite number (such as zero), the standard deviation, when multiplied by two, was less than the mean (as otherwise the mean was unlikely to be an appropriate measure of the centre of the distribution - <LINK REF="REF-Altman-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Altman 1996</LINK>). Endpoint scores on scales often have a finite start and end point and this rule was applied to them. Data not meeting the second standard were not presented within the RevMan graphs as the calculator assumes a normal distribution. These data were reported in the 'Other data types' of the results section if they had been analysed with appropriate non-parametric tests.</P>
<P>Change data are even more problematic as these do not have finite end points; although the scale goes from 0-100 the change in that scale may go from -100 to +100. Although most change scores are likely to be skewed, it cannot be proven from the rule outlined above, so they were presented in RevMan graphs. Where both endpoint and change data for particular outcomes were available, the former were presented in preference. </P>
<P>4.3.3 Rating scales: a wide range of instruments is available to measure mental health outcomes. These instruments vary in quality and many are ad hoc or not validated. For outcome instruments some minimum standards were set. They were that: (i) the psychometric properties of the instrument should have been described in a peer-reviewed journal; (ii) the instrument should either be (a) a self report or (b) completed by an independent rater or relative (not the therapist); and (iii) the instrument should be an unmodified global assessment of an area of functioning.</P>
<P>5. Heterogeneity<BR/>As well as inspecting the graphical presentations, the reviewers intended to check whether the differences between results of trials were greater than would be expected by chance alone using tests of heterogeneity (Chi squared). A significance level less than 0.10 was preset as evidence of heterogeneity. Were heterogeneity to have been present, a sensitivity analysis would have been undertaken. Outlying studies would have been removed from the pooled measure if they caused a substantive change in the overall findings and their data presented and discussed separately. However, the absence of data meant that this was not required. </P>
<P>6. Assessing the presence of publication bias <BR/>It was intended that data from all included trials would be entered into a funnel graph (trial effect versus trial size or 'precision') in an attempt to investigate the likelihood of overt publication bias. A formal test of funnel plot asymmetry (suggesting potential publication bias) would have been undertaken, where appropriate, according the methods of <LINK REF="REF-Egger-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Egger 1997</LINK>. Significance levels of p&lt;0.1 were set a priori to accept the presence of asymmetry. However, as only three studies reported a usable outcome and there was little variety in sample size (or precision estimate) between studies, tests of asymmetry were not appropriate.</P>
<P>7. General<BR/>Where possible, data were entered into RevMan in such a way that the area to the left of the line of no effect indicates a favourable outcome for token economy</P>
</DATA_COLLECTION>
</METHODS>
<RESULTS>
<STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<P>See Excluded and Included Studies Table.</P>
<P>1. Excluded studies<BR/>Of the 14 excluded studies nine were not studies of token economy. They concerned other behavioural, rehabilitative or psychotherapeutic interventions. One, <LINK REF="STD-McCreadie-1978" TYPE="STUDY">McCreadie 1978</LINK>, compared two neuroleptic drugs used on a token economy ward. Another, <LINK REF="STD-Elliott-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Elliott 1978</LINK>, compared contingent with non-contingent tokens while a six-week study by <LINK REF="STD-Cohen-1972" TYPE="STUDY">Cohen 1972</LINK> compared starting with two weeks of non-contingent tokens to using contingent tokens from commencement. <LINK REF="STD-Dilling-1971" TYPE="STUDY">Dilling 1971</LINK> used monetary rewards rather than tokens. Seven studies did not state that they used random allocation.</P>
<P>2. Awaiting assessment<BR/>One study, <LINK REF="STD-Xu-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Xu 1988</LINK>, is still to be obtained.</P>
<P>3. Included studies</P>
<P>3.1 Methods<BR/>Only three studies were included; all of these were reported as randomised. </P>
<P>3.2 Participants<BR/>The three included studies focused on people who had chronic illness, a long hospital stay and a diagnosis of schizophrenia. Only <LINK REF="STD-Li-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Li 1994</LINK> used published criteria (Chinese Medical Association Criteria) for the diagnosis. In addition, the patients had predominantly negative symptoms scoring greater than 25 on the SANS (Chinese version). <LINK REF="STD-Hall-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Hall 1977</LINK> included only male patients, <LINK REF="STD-Maley-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Maley 1973</LINK> only women, and <LINK REF="STD-Li-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Li 1994</LINK>, both sexes. The mean age was about 41 years and all participants were in hospital. </P>
<P>3.3 Interventions<BR/>3.3.1 Treatment group<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Hall-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Hall 1977</LINK> reported that the experimental group on a token economy ward received praise, explanation and contingent tokens. In <LINK REF="STD-Li-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Li 1994</LINK>, two nurses provided regular training in life skills, such as organising personal possessions, and organised occupational, recreational and sporting activities. The two nurses had received one week's training for this role. Tokens were administered if the score on behavioural rating scale exceeded the mean daily score for experimental group in the previous week which raised the complexity of expected goals over three months of treatment. The life skills training in <LINK REF="STD-Li-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Li 1994</LINK> was regarded by the reviewers as an integral part of a token economy intervention so the study was included.</P>
<P>3.3.2 Control group<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Hall-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Hall 1977</LINK> attempted to have a comparable 'attentional placebo' which consisted of praise, explanation and non-contingent regular monetary payments for six patients on the token economy ward. A further control group of six remained on their long stay wards and received unspecified treatment as usual. The only outcome available for analysis from this study was 'leaving the study early' so the two control groups were combined for this review. <LINK REF="STD-Li-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Li 1994</LINK> reported that control group patients, who were on the same ward as the treatment group, were asked to perform the same tasks and participate in the same social activities but did not receive life skills training or any rewards for their participation. <LINK REF="STD-Maley-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Maley 1973</LINK> did not describe the control group treatment beyond saying that it consisted of whatever treatment was available on other wards. </P>
<P>Though <LINK REF="STD-Elliott-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Elliott 1978</LINK> compared regimes, each of which omitted a single element of the token economy procedure, there were no usable studies comparing full token economies in different forms.</P>
<P>3.4 Outcomes<BR/>3.4.1 Reporting<BR/>There was a trend for the three studies to present their findings by p-values alone. It was also common to use p-values as a measure of association between intervention and outcomes instead of showing the strength of the association. Although p-values are influenced by the strength of the association, they also depend on the sample size of the groups. Scores on sub-scales were often presented but overall scores were usually not presented. Requests for raw data from authors have, so far, failed. </P>
<P>3.4.2 Missing outcomes<BR/>There were no usable data on behavioural outcomes relating to either target or non-target behaviour. This was disappointing as token economy is a behavioural intervention and behavioural changes were a primary outcome for this review. The three studies had usable data on the outcome 'leaving the study', however, for two of them this was the only usable outcome. None of the studies evaluated hospital/service outcomes such as discharge from hospital, or satisfaction with care and economic outcomes. We believe these were important omissions as token economy may involve deployment of scarce resources. </P>
<P>3.4.3 Scale derived data<BR/>Only one study, <LINK REF="STD-Li-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Li 1994</LINK>, reported usable mental state data, this being on the Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS - <LINK REF="REF-Andreasen-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Andreasen 1989</LINK>). The SANS is a six-point (0-5) scoring system which can be used for each global rating of alogia, affective blunting, avolition-apathy, anhedonia-asociality and attention impairment. A low score indicates low levels of psychotic symptoms. </P>
<P>3.4.4 Follow-up period <BR/>The duration of <LINK REF="STD-Hall-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Hall 1977</LINK> was 18 months; <LINK REF="STD-Li-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Li 1994</LINK> was three months; and <LINK REF="STD-Maley-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Maley 1973</LINK> was about six months. Schizophrenia may be a lifelong illness and to evaluate the impact of an intervention such as token economy long periods of follow-up are desirable to see if any gains are maintained.</P>
</STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<STUDY_QUALITY>
<P>1. Randomisation<BR/>Not one of the three included studies made explicit the process by which allocation to intervention groups was undertaken. Empirical research has shown that lack of adequate allocation concealment is associated with bias (<LINK REF="REF-Chalmers-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chalmers 1983</LINK>).</P>
<P>2. Blinding at outcome<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Li-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Li 1994</LINK> stated that single blind ratings were made of mental state outcomes. The other two studies made no mention of blinding. A double blind approach is not possible for token economy but it is important to prevent bias that outcomes are rated as independently of treatment as possible.</P>
<P>3. Follow-up<BR/>Two studies reported that no people left the study early. <LINK REF="STD-Li-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Li 1994</LINK>, however, had a 23% drop-out rate. The reasons for leaving the study were not reported by experimental group.</P>
</STUDY_QUALITY>
<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
<P>1. The search<BR/>About 150 electronic records were perused. Citations were excluded on the basis of not having a relevant intervention or not being controlled trials. Seventeen studies were obtained in full form. High-yield journals were found to have been previously searched by Cochrane workers. Searching references did not yield further usable data but one additional study was identified (<LINK REF="STD-Xu-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Xu 1988</LINK>). This still awaits assessment as it has been difficult to acquire. Contacting authors of included studies has not yielded further data.</P>
<P>2. Leaving the study<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Li-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Li 1994</LINK> demonstrated no significant difference for leaving the study early by three months (RR 1.2, CI 0.4-3.3, n=52). The other two studies had no patients leaving the study early at about six months (n=40) and 18 months (n=18). Wide confidence intervals were obtained and the equivalence of the two interventions cannot be assumed.</P>
<P>3. Mental state<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Li-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Li 1994</LINK> favoured the token economy approach (n=40, WMD -12.7, CI -21.44 to -3.96) for the outcome 'change in mental state' on the SANS-CV. Data for five patients was missing from the control group and for seven in the experimental group due to leaving the study early.</P>
</INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>1. Few studies<BR/>Considering that token economy was, for a period, an intervention of interest, with firm roots in experimental psychology, it is surprising that more evaluations within randomised trials do not exist. Waiting lists for admission to token economy wards would have been, and, in some parts of the world, may still be, prevalent. The only truly fair way of allocating few places is by drawing lots or randomising.</P>
<P>2. Under-powered studies<BR/>The total number of people randomised to trials of token economy relevant to this review is 110. Even if all data were available for meta-analyses such small studies are unlikely to ever produce data that is meaningful for clinical care. </P>
<P>3. Leaving the study early<BR/>Leaving the study early is regarded as a crude proxy measure for acceptability of treatment. Although wide confidence intervals were obtained, and nothing can be assumed, there is no suggestion that token economy had any effect at all on people's will to comply with the trial protocol. Two of the three studies had no patients leaving the study. This may reflect that trial participants were long stay patients. It is also feasible that the circumstances within these trials were less conducive to leaving early than is seen in contemporary drug trials. This, however, was not clear from the reports of the studies.</P>
<P>4. Mental state<BR/>There was no difference in SANS scores at baseline in <LINK REF="STD-Li-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Li 1994</LINK> which specifically selected patients with high levels of negative symptoms. Mental state data, however, shows a promising improvement in negative symptoms at about three months. These are important hypothesis-generating data, even if their clinical meaning is unclear. Few interventions have any significant effects on the negative symptoms of apathy, poverty of thought and speech, and anergia. Of course, given the chronic and disabling nature of these symptoms (<LINK REF="REF-Harrison-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harrison 1996</LINK>), much longer studies are needed. Trials should evaluate whether effects are maintained beyond the token economy environment. Even if they are not, however, it is feasible that simplified variants of token economy could be employed well beyond the large institutions from which it originally evolved.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>1. For people with schizophrenia and their families<BR/>People dealing with the disability that often accompanies negative symptoms may wish to help evaluate the token economy approach. </P>
<P>2. Clinicians<BR/>If token economy is to be used it should be instigated within the confines of a randomised trial.</P>
<P>3. For managers, funders and policy makers<BR/>Token economy may be usable in resource-poor institutions where it might be used for large numbers of patients as an aide to rehabilitation and when there are no realistic alternatives. Token economy may represent an economic alternative to modern psychosocial interventions such as cognitive behaviour therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Jones-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jones 2000</LINK>) or cognitive skills training (<LINK REF="REF-Hayes-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hayes 2000</LINK>). However, it is not yet of proven benefit, and therefore its use should be within a well designed clinical trial.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>1. General<BR/>If the trials within this review had conformed to the suggestions within the CONSORT statement on trial reporting (<LINK REF="REF-Begg-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Begg 1996</LINK>) more would be known on the effect of token economy for those with schizophrenia. Trialists should use only standardised, peer reviewed measures of outcome (<LINK REF="REF-Marshall-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marshall 2000</LINK>). Concrete dichotomous outcomes relating to target behaviours such as 'continuation of target behaviour' and 'relapse of target behaviour' were needed for clarity and relevance. A similar approach to measuring non-target behaviours would help assess the degree of generalisation of possible benefit. Outcomes relating to aggressive behaviour such as 'need for seclusion' would have been of interest. More data would have been available if trialists presented measures of association between intervention and outcome, for example, relative risks, odds-ratios, along with the raw data. Dichotomous outcomes would have been preferred wherever possible as they are easier to interpret and more clinically relevant. If p-values are used, the exact value should be reported. </P>
<P>2. Specific<BR/>Token economy, once a widely used treatment in developed countries, has fallen out of use in these countries without evaluation which would meet current standards. Token economy, however, may still be a potentially important treatment. In developing countries which still have large long-stay institutions, it may be an effective, if underevaluated, management technique. <LINK REF="STD-Li-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Li 1994</LINK> reported a promising improvement in a disabled group of patients achieved with what appear to be limited resources but only over a short time period. If this approach is to continue to be used then pragmatic 'real world' trials are needed. Such trials should be large, and follow people for a year or longer, and once discharged from the token economy ward to see if benefit is maintained. 'Hard' outcomes that are easy to measure could be used for long term follow up like 'number successfully discharged from hospital'. Though <LINK REF="STD-Elliott-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Elliott 1978</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Hall-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Hall 1977</LINK> attempted to discover the active components of token economy, their numbers were small and they came to somewhat different conclusions. The reviewers believe that while the question ' does it work?' remains unanswered then the question 'how does it work?' is of secondary importance. </P>
<P>The token economy environment has largely been discarded as a viable intervention in the mental health services of the developed world. This may not be justified. Evaluation within the confines of a well planned, conducted and reported randomised trial is likely only to be possible in the developing world were some token economy is still practised. Such a trial offers the opportunity of low-income countries to finally answer a question relating to the effects, or otherwise, of token economy. Should effects suggested by this review be real, even if not maintained beyond the environment in which the token economy is practised, much could be learnt about the management of disabled people with schizophrenia the world over.</P>
