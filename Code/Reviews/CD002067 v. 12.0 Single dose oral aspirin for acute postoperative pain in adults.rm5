<DESCRIPTION>
<P>New search with slightly more restrictive inclusion criteria, which excluded a small number of studies that included participants with pain following trauma rather than surgery. One new study identified, and included (<LINK REF="STD-Seymour-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Seymour 2003</LINK>). New outcomes relating to use of rescue medication added: number of participants using rescue medication within specified times, and mean or median time to use of rescue medication. These are additional measures of efficacy, providing information on duration of analgesia, that have been identified as clinically useful by healthcare workers. We excluded five studies that were included in the earlier review because they included participants with pain due to trauma (<LINK REF="STD-Herrmann-1980c" TYPE="STUDY">Herrmann 1980c</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Herrmann-1980d" TYPE="STUDY">Herrmann 1980d</LINK>), fracture (<LINK REF="STD-Kantor-1965" TYPE="STUDY">Kantor 1965</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wang-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 1979</LINK>) or fracture and musculoskeletal pain (<LINK REF="STD-Okun-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Okun 1979</LINK>), which are outside the scope of this update.</P>
<P>Results for participants with at least 50% pain relief over 4 to 6 hours, and participants experiencing adverse events, were not changed. The median time to use of rescue medication was about 5 hours with 600/650 mg aspirin, and the number needed to treat to prevent one participant needing rescue medication was 5 over 4 to 8 hours.</P>

<P>Aspirin is commonly used throughout the world as an over the counter (OTC) analgesic medication used to treat various painful conditions and to reduce fever. This review assessed both the pain-relieving effectiveness and the adverse effects of a single dose of aspirin in acute postoperative pain of moderate to severe intensity. We included 67 studies, with 3111 participants given aspirin in comparisons with 2632 given placebo. Most of the information was for a 600 mg or 650 mg dose. The results confirm that in patients with moderate to severe postoperative pain, about 40% of those treated with aspirin 600/650 mg will experience good levels of pain relief, compared with about 15% treated with placebo. This level of pain relief is comparable to that experienced with the same dose of paracetamol. In these single dose studies there was no significant difference between aspirin 600/650 mg and placebo for the number of participants experiencing adverse events, but at 900/1000 mg, twice as many did so, with dizziness, drowsiness, gastric irritation, nausea, and vomiting being the most common events reported.</P>

<P>For the earlier review, we identified randomised trials by searching CENTRAL (<I>The Cochrane Library</I>) (1998, Issue 1), MEDLINE (1966 to March 1998), EMBASE (1980 to January 1998), and the Oxford Pain Relief Database (1950 to 1994).

<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2012-02-18 12:13:35 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We assessed studies for methodological quality and two review authors extracted the data independently. We used summed total pain relief (TOTPAR) over four to six hours to calculate the number of participants achieving at least 50% pain relief. We used these derived results to calculate, with 95% confidence intervals, the relative benefit compared to placebo, and the number needed to treat (NNT) for one participant to experience at least 50% pain relief over four to six hours. We sought numbers of participants using rescue medication over specified time periods, and time to use of rescue medication, as additional measures of efficacy. We collected information on adverse events and withdrawals.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-02-18 12:17:39 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included 68 studies in which aspirin was used at doses from 300 mg to 1200 mg, but the vast majority of participants received either 600/650 mg (2409 participants, 64 studies) or 990/1000 mg (380 participants, eight studies). There was only one new study.</P>
<P>Studies were overwhelmingly of adequate or good methodological quality. NNTs for at least 50% pain relief over four to six hours were 4.2 (3.9 to 4.8), 3.8 (3.0 to 5.1), and 2.7 (2.0 to 3.8) for 600/650 mg, 900/1000 mg, and 1200 mg respectively, compared with placebo. Type of pain model had no significant impact on the results. Lower doses were not significantly different from placebo. These results do not differ from those of the earlier review.</P>
<P>Fewer participants required rescue medication with aspirin than with placebo over four to eight hours postdose, but by 12 hours there was no difference. The number of participants experiencing adverse events was not significantly different from placebo for 600/650 mg aspirin, but for 900/1000 mg the number needed to treat to harm was 7.5 (4.8 to 17). The most commonly reported events were dizziness, drowsiness, gastric irritation, nausea, and vomiting, nearly all of which were of mild to moderate severity.</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2012-01-27 11:38:42 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Aspirin is an effective analgesic for acute pain of moderate to severe intensity. High doses are more effective, but are associated with increased adverse events, including drowsiness and gastric irritation.

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2012-02-18 12:23:30 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review is an update of a previously published review in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews on 'Single dose oral aspirin for acute pain' (<LINK REF="REF-Edwards-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Edwards 2000</LINK>). The title now states that the review is limited to postoperative pain in adults.</P>
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2012-02-18 12:13:35 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Acute pain occurs as a result of tissue damage either accidentally due to an injury or as a result of surgery. Acute postoperative pain is a manifestation of inflammation due to tissue injury. The management of postoperative pain and inflammation is a critical component of patient care.</P>
<P>This is one of a series of reviews whose aim is to increase awareness of the range of analgesics that are potentially available, and present evidence for relative analgesic efficacy through indirect comparisons with placebo, in very similar trials performed in a standard manner, with very similar outcomes, and over the same duration. Such relative analgesic efficacy does not in itself determine choice of drug for any situation or patient, but guides policy-making at the local level. The series covers all analgesics licensed for acute postoperative pain in the UK, and dipyrone, which is commonly used in Spain, Portugal, and Latin-American countries. The results have been examined in an overview (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2011</LINK>), and important individual reviews include ibuprofen (<LINK REF="REF-Derry-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Derry 2009</LINK>), paracetamol (<LINK REF="REF-Toms-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Toms 2008</LINK>), and etoricoxib (<LINK REF="REF-Clarke-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clarke 2009</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="2">Acute pain trials</HEADING>
<P>Single dose trials in acute pain are commonly short in duration, rarely lasting longer than 12 hours. The numbers of participants are small, allowing no reliable conclusions to be drawn about safety. To show that the analgesic is working, it is necessary to use placebo (<LINK REF="REF-McQuay-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">McQuay 2005</LINK>). There are clear ethical considerations in doing this. These ethical considerations are answered by using acute pain situations where the pain is expected to go away, and by providing additional analgesia, commonly called rescue analgesia, if the pain has not diminished after about an hour. This is reasonable, because not all participants given an analgesic will have significant pain relief. Approximately 18% of participants given placebo will have significant pain relief (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2006</LINK>), and up to 50% may have inadequate analgesia with active medicines. The use of additional or rescue analgesia is hence important for all participants in the trials.</P>
<P>Clinical trials measuring the efficacy of analgesics in acute pain have been standardised over many years. Trials have to be randomised and double-blind. Typically, in the first few hours or days after an operation, patients develop pain that is moderate to severe in intensity, and will then be given the test analgesic or placebo. Pain is measured using standard pain intensity scales immediately before the intervention, and then using pain intensity and pain relief scales over the following four to six hours for shorter-acting drugs, and up to 12 or 24 hours for longer-acting drugs. Pain relief of half the maximum possible pain relief or better (at least 50% pain relief) is typically regarded as a clinically useful outcome. For patients given rescue medication it is usual for no additional pain measurements to be made, and for all subsequent measures to be recorded as initial pain intensity or baseline (zero) pain relief (baseline observation carried forward). This process ensures that analgesia from the rescue medication is not wrongly ascribed to the test intervention. In some trials the last observation is carried forward, which gives an inflated response for the test intervention compared to placebo, but the effect has been shown to be negligible over four to six hours (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2005</LINK>). Patients usually remain in the hospital or clinic for at least the first six hours following the intervention, with measurements supervised, although they may then be allowed home to make their own measurements in trials of longer duration.</P>
<P>Knowing the relative efficacy of different analgesic drugs at various doses can be helpful. An example is the relative efficacy in the third molar extraction pain model (<LINK REF="REF-Barden-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barden 2004</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Aspirin</HEADING>
<P>Aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid, (ASA)) is an analgesic and a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID); it also has antipyretic (reducing fever) and anti-inflammatory effects. Aspirin has been known to be an effective analgesic for many years. Rheumatism has affected man since the great river cultures of the Middle East. Clay tablets from the Sumerian period described the use of willow leaves to treat it. The Egyptians were also aware of the pain-relieving effects of potions made from myrtle or willow leaves. Edward Stone, a vicar from Chipping Norton in Oxfordshire, is generally recognised as the man who gave the first scientific description of the effects of willow bark. In 1763 he wrote a letter to the Earl of Macclesfield, then President of the Royal Society in London, in which he described treating patients suffering from ague (fever) with 20 grains (approximately a 1000 mg) of powdered willow bark in a dram of water every four hours. Today aspirin is commonly used throughout the world for many different pain conditions.</P>
<P>When used as an analgesic for adults, aspirin is given orally at a dose of 300 to 1000 mg every four to six hours, with a maximum of 4000 mg daily. In some countries/the UK it is contraindicated in children under 16 years (due to its association with Reye's syndrome), except in certain conditions, such as Kawasaki disease. Much lower doses (typically 75 mg or 81 mg daily) are used for antiplatelet effects to prevent cardiovascular events.</P>
<P>Aspirin use is associated with a high incidence of gastrointestinal irritation and occult (hidden) blood loss, and occasional overt gastrointestinal bleeding, even with short-term use. Dispersible and enteric coated formulations have been developed to limit these gastrointestinal adverse effects. The availability of alternative drugs with better tolerability has reduced the use of aspirin for pain relief in many countries in recent years. In the UK in 2010 just over 4 million prescriptions for aspirin were written in primary care, mostly for 300 mg dispersible or enteric coated tablets (<LINK REF="REF-PCA-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">PCA 2011</LINK>); in 2009 the number was almost 4.6 million, while in 2006 it was just over 6 million. In other parts of the world, where newer alternatives are either not available or are too expensive, aspirin may still be the main analgesic in use.</P>

<THEORY MODIFIED="2011-08-15 18:45:19 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Clinicians prescribe NSAIDs on a routine basis for a range of mild-to-moderate pain. NSAIDs are the most commonly prescribed analgesic medications worldwide, and their efficacy for treating acute pain has been well demonstrated (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2003</LINK>). They reversibly inhibit cyclooxygenase (prostaglandin endoperoxide synthase), the enzyme mediating production of prostaglandins and thromboxane A2 (<LINK REF="REF-Fitzgerald-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fitzgerald 2001</LINK>). Prostaglandins mediate a variety of physiological functions such as maintenance of the gastric mucosal barrier, regulation of renal blood flow, and regulation of endothelial tone. They also play an important role in inflammatory and nociceptive processes. Aspirin's main mechanism of action is irreversible inhibition of the enzyme cyclooxygenase 1 (COX-1) and modification of cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2), which interferes with thromboxane and prostaglandin synthesis, and increases production of anti-inflammatory lipoxins. Other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs cause reversible inhibition of the cyclooxygenases.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Data analysis</HEADING>
<P>For each study we converted the mean summed total pain relief (TOTPAR), summed pain intensity difference (SPID), VAS TOTPAR or VAS SPID (<LINK REF="APP-04" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 4</LINK>) values for active and placebo to %maxTOTPAR or %maxSPID by division into the calculated maximum value (<LINK REF="STD-Cooper-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Cooper 1991</LINK>), and calculated the proportion of participants in each treatment group who achieved at least 50%maxTOTPAR using verified equations (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moore-1997a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 1997a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moore-1997b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 1997b</LINK>). We then converted these proportions into the number of participants achieving at least 50%maxTOTPAR by multiplying by the total number of participants in the treatment group. We used this information on the number of participants with at least 50%maxTOTPAR for active and placebo to calculate relative benefit or relative risk, and number needed to treat to benefit (NNT).</P>
<P>We accepted the following pain measures for the calculation of TOTPAR or SPID:</P>
<UL>
<LI>five-point categorical pain relief (PR) scales with comparable wording to "none, slight, moderate, good or complete";</LI>
<LI>four-point categorical pain intensity (PI) scales with comparable wording to "none, mild, moderate, severe";</LI>
<LI>VAS for pain relief;</LI>
<LI>VAS for pain intensity.</LI>
</UL>
<P>If none of these measures were available, we used the number of participants reporting "very good or excellent" on a five-point categorical global scale with the wording "poor, fair, good, very good, excellent" for the number of participants achieving at least 50% pain relief (<LINK REF="REF-Collins-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Collins 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>For each treatment group we extracted the number of participants reporting treatment-emergent adverse effects, and calculated relative benefit and risk estimates with 95% confidence intervals (CI) using a fixed-effect model (<LINK REF="REF-Morris-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morris 1995</LINK>). We calculated NNT and number needed to treat to harm (NNH) and 95% CI using the pooled number of events using the method devised by Cook and Sackett (<LINK REF="REF-Cook-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cook 1995</LINK>). We assumed a statistically significant difference from control when the 95% CI of the relative risk (RR) or relative benefit (RB) did not include the number one. We examined homogeneity visually using L'Abbé plots (<LINK REF="REF-L_x0027_Abb_x00e9_-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">L'Abbé 1987</LINK>).</P>
<P>We planned subgroup analyses to determine the effect of dose and presenting condition (pain model), and sensitivity analyses for high versus low (two or fewer versus three or more) quality trials. A minimum of two studies and 200 participants had to be available in any subgroup or sensitivity analysis (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 1998</LINK>), which was restricted to the primary outcome (50% pain relief over four to six hours) and the dose with the greatest amount of data (600/650 mg).</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-02-18 12:13:35 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This updated review included essentially the same studies as the earlier review, adding one more recent study with 153 participants in comparisons of aspirin 900 mg with placebo and excluding five studies that were included in the earlier review because they included participants with pain due to trauma (<LINK REF="STD-Herrmann-1980c" TYPE="STUDY">Herrmann 1980c</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Herrmann-1980d" TYPE="STUDY">Herrmann 1980d</LINK>), fracture (<LINK REF="STD-Kantor-1965" TYPE="STUDY">Kantor 1965</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wang-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 1979</LINK>), or fracture and musculoskeletal pain (<LINK REF="STD-Okun-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Okun 1979</LINK>), all outside the scope of this update. Results for the primary outcome of at least 50% total pain relief over four to six hours are unchanged for doses of 600/650 mg (number needed to treat (NNT) 4.2), 900/1000 mg (3.8), and 1200 mg (2.7), compared with placebo. There was no statistically significant difference between doses of 600/650 mg and 900/100 mg, or between 900/1000 mg and 1200 mg, but 1200 mg was significantly better than 600/650 mg (z = 2.416, P = 0.016) for this outcome, based on limited numbers of participants at the higher dose; dose response for analgesics is consistently difficult to determine except in direct comparisons (<LINK REF="REF-McQuay-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">McQuay 2007</LINK>). Doses below 500 mg were not significantly better than placebo.</P>
<P>Indirect comparison with other common analgesics, evaluated in the same way, indicate that aspirin 600/650 mg has comparable efficacy for at least 50% pain relief over four to six hours, to celecoxib 200 mg (NNT 4.2 (3.4 to 5.6); <LINK REF="REF-Derry-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Derry 2008</LINK>), ibuprofen 100 mg (4.3 (3.2 to 6.4); <LINK REF="REF-Derry-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Derry 2009</LINK>), and paracetamol 600/650 mg (4.6 (3.9 to 5.5); <LINK REF="REF-Toms-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Toms 2008</LINK>). This 'mg for mg' equivalence between 600 mg of aspirin and 600 mg paracetamol was also seen in a randomised direct comparison in 1965 (<LINK REF="REF-Houde-1965" TYPE="REFERENCE">Houde 1965</LINK>).</P>
<P>This review also considered number of participants requiring rescue medication within defined time periods, and time to use of rescue medication, as additional measures of analgesic efficacy. The NNT to prevent remedication was about 5 over four to eight hours after dosing for both 600/650 mg and 900/1000 mg doses, and not significantly different from placebo by 12 hours for the 600/650 mg dose. In most studies, participants were asked to wait for two hours after taking study medication before using rescue medication; the weighted mean of the median time to use of rescue medication was about five hours for 600/650 mg aspirin and three hours for placebo. The time to remedication with the 900/1000 mg dose was unexpectedly much shorter, at 1.9 hours for aspirin and 1.2 hours for placebo. The reason for much earlier remedication in these participants is unclear, but in one of the studies they could take rescue medication at any time, and in the other they were encouraged to wait for one hour.</P>
<P>There was no difference in the number of participants reporting any adverse event for aspirin 600/650 mg compared with placebo, but for 900/1200 mg significantly more aspirin than placebo treated participants experienced adverse events, with a number needed to treat to harm (NNH) of 7.5. Most events were mild or moderate in severity and transient (self limiting, did not require treatment), with only one study reporting any adverse event ("medical problems") withdrawals. Gastrointestinal events (e.g. gastric irritation) and central nervous system events (e.g. nausea) were more common with aspirin, but many of the events reported may be due to the anaesthetic and surgery, rather than the test drug.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2012-02-18 12:35:29 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We carried out extensive bibliographic searches for published studies, and identified a large body of data. Studies followed standard methods and the great majority reported data for most of our prespecified outcomes. Single dose studies can tell us whether a drug is an effective analgesic, but do not tell us about the best dosing regimens, or how the drug performs or is tolerated in the longer term.</P>
<P>Adverse events were collected using various methods (spontaneous reporting, observed at clinic visits, questioning, patient diary) over different periods of time. This may have included periods after the use of rescue medication, which may cause its own adverse events. Poor reporting of adverse events in acute pain trials have been noted before (<LINK REF="REF-Edwards-1999a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Edwards 1999a</LINK>). The usefulness of single dose studies for assessing adverse events is questionable, but it is nonetheless reassuring that no serious adverse events were reported, and only one study reported withdrawals due to "medical problems". Long-term multiple dose studies should be used for meaningful analysis of adverse events since, even in acute pain settings, analgesics are likely to be used in multiple doses. The difficulty will be that the postoperative setting is one in which there are many sequelae of surgery and anaesthesia that manifest as adverse events, like nausea, vomiting, or abdominal discomfort, while others, like headache, can be caused by acute caffeine withdrawal over the postoperative period. The main issue is that of rare but serious adverse events, and these are more likely to be found in large observational studies.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2012-02-18 12:13:35 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Many of the studies were older, with only one published in the last 10 years, but 65/68 satisfied minimum criteria for adequate quality (&#8805; 3/5 on the Oxford Quality Scale), and 45/68 scored 4 or 5/5. All studies were randomised and double-blind, with points lost due to failure to report sufficient detail of the methods of randomisation and blinding, which may reflect older reporting of methods rather than actual poor study quality. The variability seen between individual studies (<LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK>) is that to be expected for their size (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 1998</LINK>).</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2012-02-18 12:13:35 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We identified a large amount of information in studies that satisfied out inclusion criteria, but four studies could not be obtained in full copy in the UK, and we excluded a number of studies either because they did not describe their methods in sufficient detail to determine eligibility, or because they used non-standard methods. It is also possible that there are data that we failed to identify, for example because they are unpublished. However, we think it unlikely that the amount of missing data is large enough to significantly affect the primary outcome, particularly for the 600/650 mg dose. An additional 4000 participants would have to have been involved in unpublished trials with zero treatment effects for the NNT for at least 50% pain relief to increase above 8, a level we consider to be the limit of clinical utility for this outcome (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2008</LINK>).</P>

<P>This updated review confirms that aspirin is an effective analgesic for acute postoperative pain of moderate to severe intensity. The 600/650 mg dose has comparable efficacy to the same dose of paracetamol, and a 1200 mg gives a better response. However, even in these single dose studies, adverse events such as gastric irritation and nausea were more common with aspirin than placebo at higher does.</P>

<P>It is unlikely that further studies of this sort will be carried out for aspirin, and we have a sufficiently large body of evidence to be confident with the results for the 600/650 mg dose. In many parts of the world, use of aspirin as an analgesic is falling because of its known gastrointestinal effects.</P>

<P>
<B>Categorical rating scale:</B> the commonest is the five category scale (none, slight, moderate, good or lots, and complete). For analysis numbers are given to the verbal categories (for pain intensity, none = 0, mild = 1, moderate = 2, and severe = 3, and for relief none = 0, slight = 1, moderate = 2, good or lots = 3, and complete = 4). Data from different subjects are then combined to produce means (rarely medians) and measures of dispersion (usually standard errors of means). The validity of converting categories into numerical scores was checked by comparison with concurrent visual analogue scale measurements. Good correlation was found, especially between pain relief scales using cross-modality matching techniques. Results are usually reported as continuous data, mean or median pain relief or intensity. Few studies present results as discrete data, giving the number of participants who report a certain level of pain intensity or relief at any given assessment point. The main advantages of the categorical scales are that they are quick and simple. The small number of descriptors may force the scorer to choose a particular category when none describes the pain satisfactorily.</P>
<P>
<B>VAS:</B> visual analogue scale: lines with left end labelled "no relief of pain" and right end labelled "complete relief of pain", seem to overcome this limitation. Patients mark the line at the point which corresponds to their pain. The scores are obtained by measuring the distance between the no relief end and the patient's mark, usually in millimetres. The main advantages of VAS are that they are simple and quick to score, avoid imprecise descriptive terms and provide many points from which to choose. More concentration and co-ordination are needed, which can be difficult postoperatively or with neurological disorders.</P>
<P>
<B>TOTPAR:</B> total pain relief (TOTPAR) is calculated as the sum of pain relief scores over a period of time. If a patient had complete pain relief immediately after taking an analgesic, and maintained that level of pain relief for six hours, they would have a six-hour TOTPAR of the maximum of 24. Differences between pain relief values at the start and end of a measurement period are dealt with by the composite trapezoidal rule. This is a simple method that approximately calculates the definite integral of the area under the pain relief curve by calculating the sum of the areas of several trapezoids that together closely approximate to the area under the curve.</P>
<P>
<B>SPID</B>: summed pain intensity difference (SPID) is calculated as the sum of the differences between the pain scores over a period of time. Differences between pain intensity values at the start and end of a measurement period are dealt with by the trapezoidal rule.</P>
<P>
<B>VAS TOTPAR and VAS SPID</B> are visual analogue versions of TOTPAR and SPID.</P>
