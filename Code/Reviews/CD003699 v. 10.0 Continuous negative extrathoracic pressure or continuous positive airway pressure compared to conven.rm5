<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2013-11-04 14:42:16 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Children develop respiratory failure and shortage of oxygen when they have infectious or non-infectious respiratory illnesses. Continuous negative extrathoracic pressure (CNEP) which keeps lungs open by creating negative pressure on the chest or continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) which keeps lungs open by delivering positive pressure in the lungs during all phases of breathing are used to help increase blood oxygen levels in respiratory failure and thereby reduce organ damage and risk of death. However, the safety and efficacy of these methods of respiratory support are uncertain. The searches for this review were updated in July 2013.</P>
<P>We included two studies in the review: one study of CNEP included 33 participants younger than one year old who had bronchiolitis and one study of CPAP included 37 participants who had dengue fever related illness. Both studies reported short-term improvements but no reports of clinically significant outcomes are available. With a small number of patients in both studies, the safety of either approach could not be evaluated. Both studies have methodological issues and were under-powered (had too few patients to detect a significant difference). No adverse events were reported in ether of the included trials. Well-designed, multicentre, controlled studies with adequate numbers of infants and which assess clinically important outcomes are needed, as we cannot comment on the safety of the intervention as it was not evaluated in the current studies. The major limitation of this review is that it has a very limited number of studies which include a very small sample of children.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2013-10-30 02:24:36 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Liz Dooley">
<P>Acute hypoxaemic respiratory failure (AHRF) is an important cause of mortality and morbidity in children. Positive pressure ventilation is currently the standard care, however, it does have complications. Continuous negative extrathoracic pressure (CNEP) ventilation or continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) ventilation delivered via non-invasive approaches (Ni-CPAP) have shown certain beneficial effects in animal and uncontrolled human studies.</P>

<P>We assessed risk of bias of the included studies using allocation concealment, blinding of intervention, completeness of follow-up and blinding of outcome measurements.

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-10-30 02:24:36 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We identified two eligible studies: one of CPAP and one of CNEP (published as an abstract). Both were unblinded studies with mainly unclear risk of bias due to lack of adequate information to assess this. The CPAP study enrolled 37 children to oxygen mask and CPAP and reported improvement in respiratory rate and oxygen saturation in both arms after 30 minutes of application. The CNEP study was published as an abstract and included 33 infants with bronchiolitis. In the CNEP study there was a reduction in the fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO<SUB>2</SUB>) (less than 30% within one hour of initiation of therapy) in four participants in the CNEP group compared to none in the control group (RR 10.7, 95% CI 0.6 to 183.9). One infant required CPAP and mechanical ventilation in the control group while all infants in the CNEP group were managed without intubation (RR for both outcomes 0.40, 95% CI 0.02 to 9.06). None of the trials reported on mortality. No adverse events were reported in ether of the included trials.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2013-11-04 07:05:25 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2013-10-30 02:24:36 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Liz Dooley">
<P>Acute hypoxaemic respiratory failure (AHRF) is associated with high mortality and morbidity (<LINK REF="REF-Peters-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Peters 1998</LINK>). The underlying cause of AHRF is the major determinant of mortality rather than the severity of AHRF itself (<LINK REF="REF-Peters-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Peters 1998</LINK>). Major causes of AHRF in children include respiratory infection, non-infectious respiratory diseases and interstitial pneumonitis and associated multi-system failure. Vulnerable children may be immunodeficient, born prematurely or those with neuromuscular disorders.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2013-10-30 02:40:13 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Management of AHRF requires treatment of the primary cause. It also requires respiratory support, for which there are various methods including oxygen administration, continuous distending pressure (CDP) ventilation or both. CDP can be applied via positive or negative pressure ventilation. Positive pressure support can be achieved by non-invasive or invasive continuous positive airway pressure (Ni-CPAP or iCPAP) or positive pressure ventilation (PPV). CPAP is achieved with a face mask, nasal prongs, nasopharyngeal tube or endotracheal tube using a conventional ventilator or CPAP driver. PPV is achieved via an endotracheal tube attached to a conventional ventilator.</P>
<P>The purpose of CPAP is to avoid airway collapse even during the expiration phase in order to improve oxygenation (<LINK REF="REF-Alexander-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alexander 1979</LINK>). It reduces mortality and the rate of intubation in patients with cardiogenic pulmonary oedema (<LINK REF="REF-Pang-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pang 1998</LINK>). Earlier use of CPAP was shown to be effective in increasing oxygenation in preterm infants with hyaline membrane disease (<LINK REF="REF-Allen-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Allen 1977</LINK>). Delivered via an endotracheal tube, CPAP became the most widely used form of respiratory support. More recently, with modern, often micro-processor-controlled, continuous negative pressure ventilators, CPAP has been delivered without endotracheal intubation.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2013-10-30 02:40:58 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Continuous negative extrathoracic pressure ventilation (CNEP) is an alternative, non-invasive form of respiratory support. It is applied externally to the thorax using a negative pressure chamber with a seal around the neck to produce lung distension. CNEP was the only way of providing respiratory support prior to the advent of modern ventilators (<LINK REF="REF-Woollam-1976a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Woollam 1976a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Woollam-1976b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Woollam 1976b</LINK>). In a piglet model of acute lung injury, both CNEP and positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) were found to have similar effects on pulmonary function and the cardiovascular system (<LINK REF="REF-Easa-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Easa 1994</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-Skaburskis-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Skaburskis 1987</LINK> demonstrated in a dog model of acute lung injury that CNEP provided similar improvements to positive end expiratory pressure ventilation in oxygenation without cardiac depression. <LINK REF="REF-Adams-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Adams 1992</LINK> showed that CNEP improved oxygenation with maintenance of cardiac output in piglets with normal lungs. CNEP reduced the risks associated with intubation such as the introduction of pathogens into the lungs, impedance to venous return to heart and pulmonary circulation, and the subsequent increase in pulmonary vascular resistance (<LINK REF="REF-Raine-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Raine 1993</LINK>). Successful use of CNEP has been reported in patients with central hypoventilation (<LINK REF="REF-Hartmann-1994b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hartmann 1994b</LINK>), cystic fibrosis (<LINK REF="REF-Klonin-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Klonin 2000</LINK>), postcardiac surgery (<LINK REF="REF-Penny-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Penny 1991</LINK>) and patients with phrenic nerve palsy (<LINK REF="REF-Raine-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Raine 1992</LINK>). The disadvantages of CNEP include technical difficulties, obstructed venous flow from the upper half of the body due to the neck seal and difficult access for care of the patient (<LINK REF="REF-McGettigan-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">McGettigan 1998</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2013-11-04 07:05:25 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>A previous systematic review showed that continuous distending pressure (CPAP or CNEP) for respiratory distress syndrome in neonates reduced mortality in preterm infants despite an increased rate of pneumothoraces (<LINK REF="REF-Ho-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ho 2010</LINK>). They included three studies of CNEP (pressure varied between 4 and 14 cm) and three studies of CPAP (applied via face mask) in their review. Uncontrolled clinical trials have shown beneficial effects of CNEP with or without assisted ventilation (<LINK REF="REF-Chernick-1972" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chernick 1972</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cvetnic-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cvetnic 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Outerbridge-1972" TYPE="REFERENCE">Outerbridge 1972</LINK>). A cross-over trial of intermittent mandatory ventilation with CNEP compared with PEEP for neonatal hypoxaemia showed that rescue therapy with CNEP was effective in infants with refractory hypoxaemia and may avoid extracorporeal life support therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Cvetnic-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cvetnic 1992</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-Gappa-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gappa 1994</LINK> observed improvements in pulmonary mechanics in infants recovering from neonatal respiratory distress syndrome. CNEP may avoid the need for extracorporeal life support in infants with severe lung disease and pulmonary hypertension (<LINK REF="REF-Sills-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sills 1989</LINK>). In adults, CNEP was shown to be associated with side effects such as apnoea or hypopnoea (<LINK REF="REF-Levy-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Levy 1992</LINK>), lower oesophageal sphincter dysfunction (<LINK REF="REF-Marino-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marino 1992</LINK>), predisposition to the risk of aspiration and increased venous return (<LINK REF="REF-Borelli-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Borelli 1998</LINK>). These side effects can be harmful to children with certain disorders such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy.</P>
<P>We undertook this review because the use of CNEP or Ni-CPAP compared to PPV for AHRF has not previously been systematically evaluated in terms of relative effectiveness in children.</P>

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2013-10-30 02:51:35 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Each review author performed an independent assessment of trials for methodological quality according to the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). We independently assessed each identified trial for methodological quality with respect to: random sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding of participants and personnel, incomplete outcome data, selective reporting and other bias. We included this information in the <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK> table and completed the 'Risk of bias' tables, addressing the above methodological issues.</P>
<P>1. Random sequence generation. For each included study, we described the method used to generate the allocation sequence as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>low risk of bias (any truly random process, for example, random number table, computer random number generator);</LI>
<LI>high risk of bias (any non-random process, for example, odd or even date of birth, hospital or clinic record number); or</LI>
<LI>unclear risk of bias (insufficient information about the sequence generation process to permit judgement of 'low risk' or 'high risk').</LI>
</UL>
<P>2. Allocation concealment. For each included study, we described the method used to conceal the allocation sequence as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>low risk of bias (for example, telephone or central randomisation, consecutively numbered, sealed, opaque envelopes);</LI>
<LI>high risk of bias (open random allocation, unsealed or non-opaque envelopes, alternation, date of birth); or</LI>
<LI>unclear risk of bias (insufficient information to permit judgement of 'low risk' or 'high risk').  </LI>
</UL>
<P>3. Blinding of participants, personnel and outcome assessors. For each included study, we described the methods used to blind study participants and personnel from knowledge of which intervention a participant received. We assessed the methods as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>low risk of bias, high risk of bias or unclear risk of bias for participants;</LI>
<LI>low risk of bias, high risk of bias or unclear risk of bias for study personnel; and</LI>
<LI>low risk of bias, high risk of bias or unclear risk of bias for outcome assessors and specific outcomes assessed. </LI>
</UL>
<P>4. Incomplete outcome data. For each included study and for each outcome we described the completeness of data including attrition and exclusions from the analysis. We addressed whether attrition and exclusions were reported, the numbers included in the analysis at each stage (compared with the total randomised participants), reasons for attrition or exclusion where reported, and whether missing data were balanced across groups or were related to outcomes. We assessed methods as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>low risk of bias (&lt; 20% missing data);</LI>
<LI>high risk of bias (&gt; 20% missing data); or</LI>
<LI>unclear risk of bias.</LI>
</UL>
<P>5. Selective outcome reporting. For each included study, we assessed the possibility of selective outcome reporting bias as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>low risk of bias (where it is clear that all of the study's pre-specified outcomes and all expected outcomes of interest to the review have been reported);</LI>
<LI>high risk of bias (where not all the study's pre-specified outcomes have been reported, one or more reported primary outcomes were not pre-specified, outcomes of interest are reported incompletely and so cannot be used, study fails to include results of a key outcome that would have been expected to have been reported); or</LI>
<LI>unclear risk of bias.  </LI>
</UL>
<P>6. Other sources of bias. For each included study, we noted any important concerns regarding other possible sources of bias (for example, whether there was a potential source of bias related to the specific study design). We assessed whether each study was free of other problems that could put it at risk of bias as follows:</P>
<UL>
<LI>yes (low risk of bias);</LI>
<LI>no (high risk of bias); or</LI>
<LI>unclear risk of bias.</LI>

<P>The <LINK REF="STD-Cam-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Cam 2002</LINK> study included 37 children (18 received CPAP and 18 received oxygen via mask) who had dengue shock syndrome. The inclusion criteria were infants with a clinical diagnosis of dengue shock syndrome who had acute respiratory failure, defined as failure to respond to 40% oxygen given via nasal cannula, evidenced by (a) cyanosis, oxygen saturation &lt; 93 or PaO<SUB>2</SUB> &lt; 70 mm Hg; (b) respiratory rate &gt; 50 breaths/minute; or (c) severe chest retraction and nasal flaring. CPAP was started at 6 cm water pressure delivered through a Beneviste valve connected to binasal prongs at a FiO<SUB>2</SUB> of 60%. The oxygen mask group received oxygen via a face mask with reservoir bag at a flow rate of 6 to 8 l/min resulting in a FiO<SUB>2</SUB> of 60% to 80%.

<P>The effectiveness of either continuous negative extrathoracic pressure (CNEP) or non-invasive continuous positive airway pressure (Ni-CPAP) in acute hypoxaemic respiratory failure (AHRF) in children has not been evaluated in detail. We included two studies in this review, one of which is published in an abstract form only (<LINK REF="STD-Hartmann-1994a" TYPE="STUDY">Hartmann 1994a</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Cam-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Cam 2002</LINK> studied the effectiveness of CPAP over a 30-minute period in children with dengue fever and <LINK REF="STD-Hartmann-1994a" TYPE="STUDY">Hartmann 1994a</LINK> studied the effectiveness of CNEP in children with AHRF over one hour. Short-term improvements in outcomes were reported in both studies with improvement in haemodynamic parameters. The severity of the underlying illness in both studies is difficult to assess from the data provided because in one study (<LINK REF="STD-Cam-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Cam 2002</LINK>) only four participants required mechanical ventilation whereas in the second study (<LINK REF="STD-Hartmann-1994a" TYPE="STUDY">Hartmann 1994a</LINK>) only one of the control group infants required assisted ventilation.</P>

<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2013-10-30 03:04:40 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Samuels-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Samuels 1989</LINK> was the first to report on the use of CNEP in this population. The participants were not randomised. Reduction in oxygen requirements was evident in 75 out of 88 participants after two hours and in 74 out of 88 participants after 48 hours. There was no comparison group so it is difficult to assess the effectiveness of CNEP on mortality or other significant outcomes. <LINK REF="STD-Linney-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Linney 1997</LINK> published a report from the same institution on a subgroup of patients with bronchiolitis. The authors showed that CNEP helped in avoiding intubation in the majority of participants (26 out of 27). This was a non-randomised study. <LINK REF="REF-Samuels-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Samuels 1996</LINK> reported on the use of CNEP in neonatal respiratory distress syndrome in a randomised controlled trial (RCT). Infants were randomised to standard therapy or standard therapy and CNEP. CNEP resulted in a reduction in the number of infants needing intubation (5%), reduced duration of oxygen therapy and subsequent reduction in the incidence of chronic lung disease of preterm infants. However, there was a statistically insignificant increase in mortality, cranial ultrasound abnormalities and pneumothoraces in the CNEP group.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Corrado-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Corrado 1998</LINK>, in a retrospective case-control study, compared CNEP and conventional ventilation in the treatment of acute respiratory failure in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients and found negative pressure ventilation to be equally efficacious in reducing in-hospital mortality. <LINK REF="REF-Corrado-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Corrado 2002</LINK>, in a retrospective case-control study, compared negative pressure ventilation and non-invasive positive pressure ventilation in the treatment of acute chronic respiratory failure in adult patients with COPD in four intermediate respiratory intensive care units (ICUs) in Italy. Both ventilatory techniques were found to be equally effective in avoiding endotracheal intubation and death.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Gorini-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gorini 2001</LINK> studied seven adult patients who had acute exacerbation of COPD using a microprocessor-based negative pressure ventilator and found that CNEP in association with negative pressure ventilation improved ventilatory patterns, arterial blood gases and reduced the work of inspiratory muscles. Negative pressure ventilation has a limitation of triggering capability. <LINK REF="REF-Gorini-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gorini 2002</LINK> studied a microprocessor-based negative pressure ventilator capable of thermistor triggering in four normal participants and six patients with COPD. The authors found that this technique improved the synchrony between the patient and the negative pressure ventilator. Thus, in these uncontrolled studies negative pressure ventilation has been found to be equally as efficacious as conventional mechanical ventilation in adult patients with respiratory failure, however prospective studies comparing these interventions are lacking.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Soong-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Soong 1993</LINK> studied 10 infants with bronchiolitis and impending respiratory failure in a non-randomised study. They reported improvement in symptoms, signs and physiologic parameters (heart rate, respiratory rate, PaCO<SUB>2</SUB> and oxygenation index) after two hours of application of CPAP.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Hilbert-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hilbert 2000</LINK> evaluated adult patients who were neutropenic and had AHRF treated by CPAP. They reported that CPAP was successful in avoiding intubation in 25% of the patients.</P>
<P>Use of CPAP in neonates has shown some benefits but the trials were conducted in the pre-surfactant era (<LINK REF="REF-Ho-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ho 2010</LINK>). Recently, <LINK REF="REF-Declaux-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Declaux 2000</LINK> in a RCT of CPAP in AHRF adults showed that after one hour of therapy the subjective response to treatment and PaO<SUB>2</SUB>/FiO<SUB>2</SUB> ratio were better in the CPAP group compared to the standard therapy group, although this was not associated with a reduced rate of intubation or in-hospital mortality.</P>
<P>The use of CPAP in paediatric AHRF is increasing. Several pilot studies (<LINK REF="STD-Essouri-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Essouri 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sanabria-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Sanabria 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stucki-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Stucki 2009</LINK>) were identified recently which have used different forms of CPAP devices such as helmet, nasal prongs or high-flow nasal cannula to generate CPAP and effectively help patients to breath easily and support respiration during acute phases. The relative ease of application prior to invasive forms of ventilation has led clinicians to use CPAP without sufficient evidence. RCTs should be conducted in this population.</P>
<P>The role of non-invasive ventilation in modern clinical practice was evaluated at an international consensus conference (<LINK REF="REF-Evans-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Evans 2001</LINK>). Important issues were raised in terms of study designs. These included matching of patients in a non-randomised fashion, the small sample size of available studies and the influence of this on confounding variables, the potential for missing undetected adverse effects in a subgroup population, practical problems associated with unblinded studies of increased care and surveillance of study participants and non-standardised assessment of qualitative endpoints. Recommendations were made for identifying means of rapidly assessing patients who will benefit from non-invasive ventilatory modes. In adult patients with AHRF, evidence was pointing towards the effectiveness of non-invasive PPV in avoiding intubation, complications and mortality. However, the need for larger controlled trials was identified (<LINK REF="REF-Evans-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Evans 2001</LINK>). Recently there have been reports on the use of CNEP and CPAP. However, these were single-centre studies with no comparative cohort or, if a comparative cohort was included, the participants did not meet the criteria for hypoxaemic respiratory failure. In light of these reports, proper studies are warranted as this practice continues to be implemented in a random fashion.</P>
<P>For future studies it is important to decide the importance of various outcomes. Reduction of in-hospital mortality is a very important outcome and even a small reduction would be beneficial. However, as patients with the most severe disease are not going to be candidates for these experimental interventions, such trials would require very large sample sizes to achieve any significant reduction. Other outcomes of interest may include reduction in intubation rates, associated complications, duration of hospital stay and increased patient comfort. Standardised interventions in the control group and assessments are warranted to assess these outcomes. CNEP and Ni-CPAP are perceived to be potentially useful in certain clinical situations where avoidance of intubation or early extubation and management by CNEP or Ni-CPAP may be useful, but further studies are warranted.</P>
<P>Thus, there is insufficient evidence from randomised studies to conclude that CNEP is beneficial in AHRF in paediatric patients. Potential advantages, such as reduction in the intubation rate, intubation-associated complications and patient comfort (less restlessness, discomfort or dyspnoea), make this modality appealing. However, properly conducted RCTs are needed to assess the benefits and risks.</P>

<P>There is a lack of well-designed, large, controlled trials comparing the use of non-invasive modes of respiratory support in children with acute hypoxaemic respiratory failure (AHRF). Uncontrolled evidence of a reduction in intubation and hospital stay with the use of continuous negative extrathoracic pressure (CNEP) and continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) needs to be confirmed in well-designed studies that evaluate the risks involved with this practice, such as pneumothorax or air leak. Studies should also stratify groups based on the severity of respiratory failure and age, and report on long-term outcomes. It is not possible to provide any recommendations, given the lack of evidence.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2013-10-30 02:24:36 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is a need for good-quality, multicentre RCTs. Reduction in mortality is an important, albeit difficult, outcome to achieve following the use of CNEP or non-invasive CPAP in paediatric AHRF. Even a small reduction in mortality is clinically very important and should be the aim of future studies. Studies assessing other outcomes, such as avoidance of intubation and its associated complications, reduction in hospital stay and improvement in patient comfort, are valuable in gauging the overall impact of these strategies.</P>
