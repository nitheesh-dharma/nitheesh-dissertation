<P>When injected into muscles BoNT-A reduces muscle tightness. When used in conjunction with occupational therapy, the aim of BoNT-A injections in the arms and hands is to improve movement and function in treated limbs. This review demonstrated improvements on a range of measures with the combined treatment. In the absence of significant side effects, injection of BoNT-A has been identified as a safe and effective treatment for upper limb spasticity when used in combination with occupational therapy in children with cerebral palsy.</P>

<P>Cerebral palsy (CP) is "a group of permanent disorders of the development of movement and posture causing activity limitation(s) that are attributed to non-progressive disturbance that occurred in the developing fetal or infant brain" (<A HREF="Rosenbaum 2007">Rosenbaum 2007</A>, p.9).

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2009-07-03 11:52:44 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Brian J Hoare">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register/CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library, Issue 3, 2008), MEDLINE (1966 to August Week 1 2008), EMBASE (1980 to 2008 Week 28) and CINAHL (1982 to August Week 1 2008). </P>

<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2009-04-08 11:22:16 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Brian J Hoare">
<P>All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing BoNT-A injection or BoNT-A injection and occupational therapy in the upper limb(s) with other types of treatment (including no treatment or placebo) in children with CP.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2009-05-18 10:57:36 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Brian J Hoare">
<P>Two authors using standardised forms extracted the data independently. Each trial was assessed for internal validity and rated for quality using the PEDro scale. Data were extracted and entered into RevMan 5.0.15.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2009-07-06 09:27:50 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Brian J Hoare">
<P>Ten trials met the inclusion criteria. PEDro quality ratings ranged from 6/10 to 10/10. Concentration of BoNT-A ranged from 50U/1.0ml to 200U/1.0ml saline with doses of 0.5U to 16U/kg body weight and total doses of 220 to 410 Units (Botox®).</P>
<P>A combination of BoNT-A and occupational therapy is more effective than occupational therapy alone in reducing impairment, improving activity level outcomes and goal achievement, but not for improving quality of life or perceived self-competence. When compared with placebo or no treatment, there is moderate evidence that BoNT-A alone is not effective.</P>

<P>This systematic review found high level evidence supporting the use of BoNT-A as an adjunct to managing the upper limb in children with spastic CP. BoNT-A should not be used in isolation but should be accompanied by planned occupational therapy.</P>
<P>Further research is essential to identify children most likely to respond to BoNT-A injections, monitor longitudinal outcomes, determine timing and effect of repeated injections and the most effective dosage, dilution and volume schedules. The most effective adjunct therapies including frequency and intensity of delivery also requires investigation.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2009-07-03 11:55:02 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Brian J Hoare">
<P>Cerebral palsy is "a group of permanent disorders of the development of movement and posture causing activity limitation(s) that are attributed to non-progressive disturbance that occurred in the developing fetal or infant brain" (<LINK REF="REF-Rosenbaum-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rosenbaum 2007</LINK>, p.9).   Cerebral palsy affects more than 2 children per 1000 live births worldwide and is the most common cause of physical disability in childhood (<LINK REF="REF-Blair-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blair 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-SCPE-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">SCPE 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stanley-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stanley 2000</LINK>). Although the brain lesions are static, the movement disorders that arise in cerebral palsy are not unchanging and are characterised by atypical muscle tone, posture, and movement (<LINK REF="REF-Rang-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rang 1990</LINK>). Cerebral palsy can also be accompanied by cognitive, psychiatric, sensory and seizure disorders (<LINK REF="REF-Bax-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bax 2005</LINK>). The spastic motor type is the most common type of cerebral palsy, comprising about 80% of all reported cases (<LINK REF="REF-Graham-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Graham 2000</LINK>). Spasticity is a motor disorder characterised by a velocity-dependent increase in tonic stretch reflexes (muscle tone) with exaggerated tendon jerks (phasic stretch reflex) resulting from hyperexcitability of the stretch reflex (<LINK REF="REF-Lance-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lance 1980</LINK>). Muscle tone is the sensation of resistance that is encountered as a joint is passively moved through a range of motion (<LINK REF="REF-Lance-and-McLeod-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lance and McLeod 1981</LINK>). Spasticity and abnormal muscle tone contribute to both the impairment of function and reduced longitudinal muscle growth in children with cerebral palsy (<A HREF="file:///C:\Documents%20and%20Settings\387770\Local%20Settings\CImms\Local%20Settings\Temporary%20Internet%20Files\OLK401\Dunne%201995">Dunne 1995</A>).</P>
<P>Conventional therapeutic management of upper limb spasticity in children with cerebral palsy has involved splinting/casting, passive stretching, the facilitation of posture and movement (e.g. occupational therapy and physiotherapy), spasticity-reducing medication and surgery (<LINK REF="STD-Hoare-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Hoare 2004</LINK>). Botulinum toxin A (BoNT-A) is now used as an adjunct to these therapeutic techniques as a means of reducing muscle tone and spasticity, and improving range of movement and function.</P>
<P>BoNT-A is a powerful neuromuscular paralysing agent that is produced by the anaerobic bacterium C<I>lostridium botulinum </I>(<LINK REF="REF-NIHCDCS-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">NIHCDCS 1991</LINK>). BoNT-A acts at the neuromuscular junction by inhibiting the release of the neurotransmitter <I>acetylcholine</I>. Injection of BoNT-A into selected muscles produces dose-dependent chemical denervation resulting in reduced muscle activity. The pharmacological effects of BoNT-A are temporary as sprouting of new nerve terminals from the treated nerves leads to reinnervation. The function of the original terminal is eventually restored leading to the recovery of the affected muscles (<LINK REF="REF-dePaiva-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">dePaiva 1999</LINK>). The period of clinically useful relaxation appears to be 12-16 weeks (<LINK REF="REF-Graham-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Graham 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>The aim of treatment with BoNT-A is to produce a selective reduction in muscle spasticity using the smallest possible dose of BoNT-A. The reduction in spasticity and muscle tone is intended to provide an opportunity to optimise the effects of splinting and casting used for increasing muscle length, enhance motor ability and functional skills and delay the need for surgery (<LINK REF="REF-Hoare-and-Russo-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hoare and Russo 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>The earlier version of this review concluded, on the basis of two Randomised Controlled Trials (RCTs), that there was insufficient evidence to support the use of BoNT-A in the management of the upper limb(s) of children with cerebral palsy (<LINK REF="REF-Wasiak-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wasiak 2004</LINK>). Wasiak and colleagues recommended that further research incorporating rigorous RCT methodology be completed to investigate the effects of BoNT-A more fully. In particular, there was no clear evidence that BoNT-A reduced muscle tone and spasticity in the upper limb of children with cerebral palsy. Nor was there evidence that a reduction of muscle tone and spasticity contributed to improved performance of the arm(s) in daily activities or enhanced participation.</P>
<P>Since Wasiak and colleagues (2004) review, use of BoNT-A has become routine clinical practice in many paediatric treatment centres worldwide and the evidence base has expanded. For example, in Australia injection of BoNTA (Botox® only) is now an approved and government funded intervention for moderate to severe spasticity of the upper limbs of children with cerebral palsy, two to 17 years of age inclusive (<LINK REF="REF-Medicare-Australia-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Medicare Australia 2009</LINK>). This updated review evaluates the existing RCT evidence on the use of BoNT-A in the upper limb of children with cerebral palsy. We aimed to determine the effectiveness of BoNT-A injections on a range of pre-defined outcomes consistent with the International Classification of Functioning, Disability, and Health (ICF) (<A HREF="file:///C:\Documents%20and%20Settings\387770\Local%20Settings\CImms\Local%20Settings\Temporary%20Internet%20Files\OLK401\WHO%202001">WHO 2001</A>) and to examine the safety of using BoNT-A in this group of children.</P>
<P>The information contained in this review may be used by clinicians and policy-makers to determine the use of BoNT-A injections as an adjunct to the management of the upper limb in children with cerebral palsy and to guide future research to ensure that the evaluation of BoNT-A as an adjunctive treatment is comprehensive and targeted.</P>

<P>
<B>Selection of trials:</B>
<BR/>Two reviewers (BH, MW) independently reviewed titles and abstracts of articles retrieved using the aforementioned search strategy. Trials that clearly failed to meet the inclusion criteria were not reviewed further. Those that could not be excluded were retrieved and reviewed in full-text by the two reviewers. In all instances, differences of opinion were resolved by discussion. Those that met criteria were retrieved and reviewed in detail.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of trials:</B>
</P>
<P>Two reviewers (BH, MW) independently assessed the methodological quality of the included trials using the PEDro scale (<LINK REF="REF-Maher-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maher 2003</LINK>) with discrepancies resolved by discussion (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>). A point is given for each of the following (maximum score = 10): random allocation; allocation concealment; prognostic similarity at baseline; subject blinding; therapist blinding; assessor blinding; greater than 85% follow up of one key outcome; intention to treat analysis; between group statistical comparison of at least one key outcome, and reporting of point estimates and measures of variability of at least one key outcome.</P>
<P>When data were entered into RevMan 5.0.15 software, allocation concealment was classified as adequate (A), unclear (B), inadequate (C), or was not used (D), as another criterion to assess validity. Additional information was requested from the authors of trials to clarify missing information related to the methodology.</P>
<P>
<B>Data extraction:</B>
<BR/>Two reviewers (BH, MW) independently extracted data from the trials using a paper pro forma. Disagreements were resolved by discussion. Additional data were sought from all authors of included papers to allow analyses on an intention-to-treat basis. This included mean change scores and standard deviation of the mean change for each outcome.</P>
<P>
<B>Analysis:</B>
<BR/>We followed the Cochrane Handbook preferred method for handling continuous variables (<LINK REF="REF-Deeks-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deeks 2005)</LINK> and as advised by the Movement Disorders Review Group. This involved contacting all primary authors to obtain mean change scores and the standard deviation of the mean difference, as opposed to comparing means and standard deviations at specific time points. This approach controls for differences in baseline performance which is a critical issue for research including small sample sizes and heterogeneous populations such as children with cerebral palsy. When appropriate data were available from valid and reliable measures, data from individual studies were entered into RevMan 5.0.15 to obtain confidence intervals and to have available when further studies are published. Pooled effects were calculated using a fixed effect model across trials using the same outcome in similar populations. The <LINK REF="STD-Corry-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Corry 1997</LINK> trial reported median change and range data precluding it from meta-analysis as the desired mean change date were unable to be provided.</P>
<P>Where possible, muscle tone measured using either the Ashworth (<LINK REF="STD-Speth-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Speth 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lowe-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Lowe 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Corry-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Corry 1997</LINK>) or modified Ashworth scales (<LINK REF="STD-Greaves-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Greaves 2004</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Russo-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Russo 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wallen-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Wallen 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fehlings-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Fehlings 2000</LINK>) were analysed using the method for ordinal response categories described by <LINK REF="REF-Whitehead-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Whitehead 1994</LINK>. Beta coefficients were pre-calculated using Stata 10.0 SE (College Station, TX) using a generic inverse variance method and entered into RevMan 5.0.15.</P>
<P>Primary information from <LINK REF="STD-Boyd-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Boyd 2004</LINK> was not made available. Hence, we calculated the following outcomes from information presented in two tables in the original dissertation.</P>
<P>1. Standard deviation and variance from baseline to subsequent weeks in the intervention group versus the control group. <LINK REF="STD-Boyd-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Boyd 2004</LINK> presented point estimates and 95% confidence intervals for this result. The standard deviation was calculated using the relationship SD = SQRT(30) * (UL - PE) / (1.96), where PE is the point estimate and UL is the 95% confidence limit. The variance was calculated as the square of the standard deviation.</P>
<P>2. Standard deviation and variance for results from baseline to subsequent weeks in the intervention group. <LINK REF="STD-Boyd-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Boyd 2004</LINK> presented point estimates and 95% confidence intervals for this result and methods used above were used.</P>
<P>3. Point estimate, variance, standard deviation for results from baseline to subsequent weeks in the control group. These results were not provided by <LINK REF="STD-Boyd-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Boyd 2004</LINK>. However, using information estimated from (1) and (2) above, the following information may be derived using well-established statistical relationships.</P>
<P>a. Point estimate: PE(2) - PE(1)</P>
<P>b. Variance: Var(2) - Var(1)</P>
<P>c. Standard deviation: Square root of the variance</P>
<P>Outcome measures with limited known validity or reliability were excluded from analysis. These included Pediatric Motor Activity Log, Actual Amount of Use Test, block transfer task (speed) and block tower task (dexterity) from <LINK REF="STD-Boyd-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Boyd 2004</LINK>, Upper Extremity Rating Scale, the Melbourne Assessment (when it was modified by the trial authors), Impact on Family Scale from <LINK REF="STD-Koman-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Koman 2007</LINK>, pain scale and subjective function and cosmesis rating from <LINK REF="STD-Russo-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Russo 2007</LINK>, subjective judgements by child and parent from <LINK REF="STD-Speth-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Speth 2005</LINK> and the parent questionnaire from <LINK REF="STD-Wallen-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Wallen 2007</LINK>.</P>
<P>Due to the large number of domains included in the CHQ, the number of existing analyses undertaken in the review and the failure to identify treatment effects, only summary data from the CHQ (<LINK REF="STD-Boyd-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Boyd 2004</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Wallen-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Wallen 2007</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Russo-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Russo 2007</LINK>) have been provided in tabular form in <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK> , <LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK> and <LINK REF="TBL-04" TYPE="TABLE">Table 4</LINK>. Similarly, only summary data from the Self Perception Profile for Children, Pictorial Scale of Perceived Competence and Social Acceptance and PEDsQL (<LINK REF="STD-Russo-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Russo 2007</LINK>) are provided (<LINK REF="TBL-05" TYPE="TABLE">Table 5</LINK>; <LINK REF="TBL-06" TYPE="TABLE">Table 6</LINK>; <LINK REF="TBL-07" TYPE="TABLE">Table 7</LINK>).</P>

<P>Using GRADEprofiler (<LINK REF="REF-GradePro" TYPE="REFERENCE">GradePro</LINK>) and the GRADE guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2008</LINK>), key results of the six comparisons have been included in <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK> to <LINK REF="SOF-06" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 6</LINK>. Through consensus, two reviewers selected the following seven outcomes for inclusion in the tables: MTS (elbow flexors); MTS (wrist flexors); QUEST; Melbourne Assessment; GAS and COPM (performance and satisfaction). A follow-up period of three months was selected as this was considered to be a time of peak effect for BoNT-A. Two reviewers (BH, CI) independently assessed the methodological quality of the body of evidence using the GRADE guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2008</LINK>) with discrepancies resolved by discussion.</P>

<P>The ten studies included in this review used a range of outcome measures across the body function/structure and activity level domains of the ICF (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2001</LINK>). No study used outcomes measuring change within the participation domain.</P>

<LINK REF="TBL-12" TYPE="TABLE">Table 12</LINK> provides details on adverse events reported for the 395 children enrolled across all included studies. One child was reported to experience a serious adverse event (<LINK REF="STD-Russo-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Russo 2007</LINK>).  This child had a past history of epilepsy and was admitted to hospital for seizure management shortly after injection. The most commonly reported adverse event was excessive grip weakness (<LINK REF="STD-Corry-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Corry 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Boyd-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Boyd 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Russo-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Russo 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kawamura-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Kawamura 2007</LINK>).

<P>When compared with occupational therapy alone, data from <LINK REF="STD-Wallen-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Wallen 2007</LINK> at the 2-week and 3-month time points identified that BoNT-A and occupational therapy significantly reduces spasticity (as measured using the MTS) in the elbow flexors (<LINK REF="CMP-002.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.2</LINK>), forearm pronators (<LINK REF="CMP-002.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.3</LINK>) and wrist flexors (<LINK REF="CMP-002.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.4</LINK>) of the upper limb.  This reduction persisted at the 6 month follow-up for elbow flexors and forearm pronators but not for wrist flexors.  Despite this result from <LINK REF="STD-Wallen-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Wallen 2007</LINK>, data from <LINK REF="STD-Greaves-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Greaves 2004</LINK> demonstrated no treatment effect for any of these outcomes except for elbow flexors at 6-weeks. A trend however, favouring BoNT-A and occupational therapy, was evident (See <LINK REF="CMP-002.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.1</LINK> to <LINK REF="CMP-002.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.4</LINK>). Data for wrist resonance frequency (<LINK REF="CMP-002.09" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.9</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-002.10" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.10</LINK>), along with 2-point discrimination (assessment of tactile sensibility) (<LINK REF="CMP-002.19" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.19</LINK>) measured by <LINK REF="STD-Boyd-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Boyd 2004</LINK> did not demonstrate a treatment effect at 3 weeks or 3 month post-injection.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Russo-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Russo 2007</LINK> measured self-perception and self-worth at 3 and 6 months using The Self-Perception Profile for Children (for children &#8805; 8 years) <LINK REF="REF-Harter-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harter 1985</LINK> (<LINK REF="TBL-05" TYPE="TABLE">Table 5</LINK>) or The Pictorial Scale of Perceived Competence and Social Acceptance for Young Children (up to 7 years of age) <LINK REF="REF-Harter-and-Pike-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harter and Pike 1984</LINK> (<LINK REF="TBL-06" TYPE="TABLE">Table 6</LINK>). The Self-Perception Profile for Children evaluates scholastic competence, social acceptance, athletic competence, physical appearance, behavioural competence, and global self-worth.  The Pictorial Scale for younger children evaluates the child's perception of his or her cognitive competence, physical competence, peer acceptance and maternal acceptance.  Both measures use 4-point rating scales with a score of 4 indicating higher self-perception/competence.  When interpreting these results we considered a change of 0.4 (or 10%) of the scale at the lower limit of the confidence intervals to be clinically important.</P>
<P>At 3 months, younger children participating in occupational therapy alone reported better peer and maternal acceptance (statistically significant and clinically important) than the BoNT-A and occupational therapy group (<LINK REF="TBL-06" TYPE="TABLE">Table 6)</LINK>.  The older children participating in occupational therapy alone reported more social acceptance than the BoNT-A and occupational therapy group, whereas the latter group perceived higher behavioural competence.

<B>Efficacy of upper limb BoNT-A injections</B>
</U>
</P>
<P>In our 2004 Cochrane review, data from two small RCTs (<LINK REF="STD-Fehlings-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Fehlings 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Corry-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Corry 1997</LINK>) provided insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of intramuscular injections of BoNT-A as an adjunct to managing the upper limb in children with cerebral palsy (<LINK REF="REF-Wasiak_x002c_-Hoare_x002c_-Wallen-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wasiak, Hoare, Wallen 2004</LINK>). This update included 10 RCTs predominantly of high quality (<LINK REF="REF-Maher-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maher 2003</LINK>) and provided high level evidence (<LINK REF="REF-GradePro" TYPE="REFERENCE">GradePro</LINK>) that BoNT-A in the upper limb in combination with occupational therapy improves outcomes at both the body function/structure and activity level domains of the ICF (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2001</LINK>) in comparison to occupational therapy alone. Additionally, there was moderate to high level evidence that BoNT-A in combination with occupational therapy improves outcomes in comparison to BoNT-A alone or no treatment/placebo. When compared with placebo or no treatment, there is moderate evidence that BoNT-A alone is not effective. No trial used outcomes measuring change within the participation domain.</P>
<P>
<B>Effects on body function and body structure level outcomes</B>
</P>
<P>For children with cerebral palsy with more severe upper limb impairment (i.e. Manual Ability Classification System level IV to V) (<LINK REF="REF-Eliasson-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eliasson 2006</LINK>), injection of BoNT-A can be used to manage symptoms and reduce carer burden. Aims for treatment using BoNT-A for these children may include: reducing muscle spasticity and muscle tone; increasing range of motion; improving agonist-antagonist balance; delaying the need for and/or complimenting orthopaedic procedures; improving tolerance to splinting; maintaining hygiene and skin integrity; improving cosmesis; managing pain and preventing long-term deformity (<LINK REF="REF-Hoare-and-Russo-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hoare and Russo 2009</LINK>). In all children who receive BoNT-A injection, assessment must include impairment-level domains.  These measures assist in identifying muscles with significant spasticity interfering with function and, alongside activity level assessment measures, provide information for muscle selection, dosage and the direction of post-injection therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Hoare-and-Russo-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hoare and Russo 2009</LINK>). In this review, data from two studies provided strong evidence that a combination of BoNT-A and occupational therapy was more effective than occupational therapy alone in reducing spasticity in the elbow flexor, forearm pronator and wrist flexor muscles of the upper limb (<LINK REF="STD-Greaves-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Greaves 2004</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Wallen-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Wallen 2007</LINK>). Additionally, using the modified Ashworth Scale (MAS), the studies by <LINK REF="STD-Greaves-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Greaves 2004</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Russo-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Russo 2007</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Wallen-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Wallen 2007</LINK> also demonstrated strong evidence that BoNT-A and occupational therapy reduced muscle tone in the same muscles groups.</P>
<P>All muscles have an optimal length at which they produce maximal contraction.  Any shortening or lengthening of the muscle fibers of the long flexors and extensors of the fingers and thumb could decrease their ability to contract maximally and impair function (<LINK REF="REF-Richards-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Richards 1996</LINK>). In this review, no improvement was found in passive ROM for any treatment group. This result is expected given the criteria adopted by all included studies where children with fixed contracture or significant fixed contracture were excluded (i.e. children had full PROM before treatment).  Therefore, change in passive range of movement is not expected.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Speth-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Speth 2005</LINK>, the only study to evaluate isolated active ROM for individual joints, demonstrated no treatment effect for wrist extension or thumb abduction. In children with spastic hemiplegic cerebral palsy, increased spasticity and muscle tone in pronator muscles changes the spatial relationships among the extrinsic muscles of their upper limb.  The result reported by <LINK REF="STD-Speth-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Speth 2005</LINK>, where active supination improved significantly more in the <I>occupational therapy alone</I> group than the BoNT-A and occupational therapy group, may be related to very low baseline scores in three children in the occupational therapy alone group who made substantial improvements. The result however, raises the question of potential limitation of BoNT-A to effect change in active supination due to antagonist weakness, changes in the mechanical-elastic properties and shortening of the pronator teres and pronator quadratus muscles in early life. As the hand is actively moved to a pronated position the radius rotates over the ulna and flexor digitorum superficialis, flexor digitorum profundus, and flexor pollicis longus wrap around the radius as it rotates.  The resulting change in length of these muscles may alter the length-tension relationship and impair their ability to achieve maximum contraction, to act as a synergist, or to act as a stabiliser of the wrist joint (<LINK REF="REF-Richards-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Richards 1996</LINK>).  On the basis of these potential changes in the length-tension relationships, one would predict a weaker grip in the pronated position than in the supinated position and further impairment of the functional effectiveness of the affected hand. The importance of active supination for grip strength and wrist stabilisation warrants further investigation of the impact of stretching/splinting the forearm pronator muscles following injection of BoNT-A in children with cerebral palsy (<LINK REF="STD-Delgado-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Delgado 2006</LINK>).  </P>

<P>
<I>Stretching </I>
</P>
<P>In 2004, Gracies reported strong evidence that BoNTA uptake is enhanced in nerve terminals that are most active, whether hyperactivity is induced by nerve stimulation or increased voluntary activity. <LINK REF="REF-Gracies-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gracies 2004</LINK> reports on studies in adults which demonstrated greater improvement after BoNT-A injection when performing periodic stimulation of the injected muscle and its antagonist for three 30-minute sessions a day during the 3 days after injection (<LINK REF="REF-Hesse-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hesse 1995</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Hesse-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hesse 1998</LINK>). Since these studies, a preliminary report relating to animal muscle has demonstrated that either active or passive manipulation of a muscle for 20 minutes immediately post-injection increases the efficacy of BoNT-A in the injected muscle and reduces diffusion to distant muscles (<LINK REF="REF-Minamoto-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Minamoto 2007</LINK>).  Based on these findings, further investigation of the effect of immediate active or passive stretch following upper limb injection in children with cerebral palsy is warranted. Longtitudinal studies are also required to explore the effects of BoNT-A on muscle morphology and growth (<LINK REF="REF-Gough-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gough 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<I>Splinting</I>
</P>
<P>The scientific support for static splinting in cerebral palsy stems from a small number of animal studies reporting that muscles increase in length when immobilised in a lengthened position (<LINK REF="REF-Williams-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Williams 1984</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Williams-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Williams 1988</LINK>) and few studies in adult lower limb literature suggesting a prolonged low load stretch is more effective than brief stretches in preventing contracture (<LINK REF="REF-Light-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Light 1984</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Steffen-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Steffen 1995</LINK>). For children with cerebral palsy, evidence that static splinting maintains the mechanical-elastic properties of muscle is weak (<LINK REF="REF-Pin-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pin 2006</LINK>). One study has suggested a splint should be worn for a minimum of 6 hours based on evidence that contractures did not occur in children with cerebral palsy when lower limb muscles were stretched for more than 6 hours (<LINK REF="REF-Tardieu-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tardieu 1988</LINK>). In adults following stroke, recent studies indicating splinting for 4 weeks did not reduce wrist contracture have led to suggestions that the practice of routine upper limb splinting to prevent muscle contracture soon after adult stroke should be discontinued (<LINK REF="REF-Lannin-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lannin 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Lannin-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lannin 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>Three of the included studies in this review reported the use upper limb splints following injection of BoNT-A (<LINK REF="STD-Greaves-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Greaves 2004</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Lowe-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Lowe 2006</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Speth-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Speth 2005</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Speth-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Speth 2005</LINK> reported all children receiving injections were provided with a night resting splint. <LINK REF="STD-Boyd-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Boyd 2004</LINK> specifically reported that no children used splints following injection, whilst the remaining studies did not report the use of splints as a component part of their post-injection management program (<LINK REF="STD-Corry-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Corry 1997</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Fehlings-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Fehlings 2000</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Koman-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Koman 2007</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kawamura-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Kawamura 2007</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Russo-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Russo 2007</LINK>). Due to the limited data, there is no evidence to support or refute the effectiveness of splinting following upper limb injections of BoNT-A. A lack of consensus remains regarding the optimal splint design (amount of wrist, digit and thumb extension) and wearing regime. A recently identified study by <LINK REF="STD-Kanellopoulos-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Kanellopoulos 2009</LINK> (awaiting classification for next update of review), should assist in providing evidence for the efficacy of upper limb splinting following upper limb injection of BoNTA.  </P>
<P>
<I>Casting</I>
</P>
<P>A recent systematic review reported insufficient evidence to either support or refute the effectiveness of upper limb casting alone in children and adults (<LINK REF="REF-Lannin-2007a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lannin 2007a</LINK>).  The authors reported a lack of consensus regarding the timing of application, casting material, positioning of joint, duration of serials and number of casts to be applied (<LINK REF="REF-Lannin-2007a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lannin 2007a</LINK>). Casting following BoNT-A injection is clinically indicated when fixed contracture is present. The BoNT-A aims to reduce spasticity whilst the cast is used to hold a joint in a specific position to achieve a low-load prolonged duration muscle stretch (<LINK REF="REF-Hoare-and-Russo-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hoare and Russo 2009</LINK>) to reduce fixed contracture and improve passive range of movement.  As all studies included in this review excluded children with fixed contracture or significant fixed contracture, casting was not used in the majority of the studies. <LINK REF="STD-Lowe-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Lowe 2006</LINK> however, reported casting as part of post-injection therapy. No further details were provided. As a result, there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the efficacy of casting in combination with BoNT-A.</P>
<P>
<I>
<B>Considerations for body function and body structure level assessment</B>
</I>
</P>
<P>Muscle weakness is a secondary consequence of cerebral palsy and impacts not only a child's ability to move but also their ability to participate fully in activities of daily living. Children with cerebral palsy do not move as much as their typically developing peers and as such their muscles do not just atrophy but fail to develop normally (<LINK REF="REF-Damiano-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Damiano 2008</LINK>). Muscles targeted for injection of BoNT-A in the upper limb often include the long finger flexors and thumb adductors/flexors, muscle groups required for generating grip strength.  The effect of BoNT-A weakens and potentially exposes underlying weakness in these muscles. This supposition is supported by the analysis of pooled data from <LINK REF="STD-Fehlings-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Fehlings 2000</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Boyd-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Boyd 2004</LINK> which indicated a reduction in grip strength following BoNT-A . This review also found excessive weakness as the most common adverse event following upper limb injection of BoNT-A in children with cerebral palsy. These issues, coupled with <LINK REF="STD-Fehlings-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Fehlings 2000</LINK> follow-up analysis identifying grip strength as a predictor for positive response to upper limb injection of Botulinum toxin-A (<LINK REF="STD-Fehlings-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Fehlings 2000</LINK>), supports establishing baseline level of grip strength prior to injection for: a) determination of appropriate muscles for injection; b) appropriate dosage used; c) monitoring of adverse events and recovery; and d) as a means of determining a child&#8217;s readiness to commence post-injection therapy. The implementation of upper limb specific strength training programs following injection of BoNT-A also warrants investigation.</P>
<P>Closer inspection of data obtained from the no treatment group from <LINK REF="STD-Wallen-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Wallen 2007</LINK> provides important information on the variability and potential measurement error of the outcome measures.  Variability was particularly evident in the modified Tardieu scale (MTS), where elbow flexor and forearm pronator muscle data (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK> to <LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>) demonstrated large mean change (up to 17°) and extreme variability (standard deviation) in the no treatment group.  This variability is consistent with recent literature relating to the poor reliability of the modified Tardieu scale for elbow flexor spasticity in children with cerebral palsy (<LINK REF="REF-Mackey-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mackey 2004</LINK>).   Despite these limitations for research purposes, clinically the modified Tardieu scale is a useful tool for identifying spasticity in larger muscles (<LINK REF="REF-Patrick-and-Ada-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Patrick and Ada 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Scholtes-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scholtes 2006</LINK>). The recently developed Australian Spasticity Assessment Scale (ASAS) however, is showing promising reliability and requires further investigation as a measure of spasticity in the upper limb in children with cerebral palsy (<LINK REF="REF-Williams-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Williams 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<B>Effects on activity level outcomes (hand function and quality of movement)</B>
</P>
<P>For children with less severe upper limb impairment (i.e. MACS level I to III) (<LINK REF="REF-Eliasson-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eliasson 2006</LINK>) injection of BoNT-A, combined with movement based therapy, targets improvement in a child's hand function. Improving hand skills , occupational performance and functional activities are often the goals for treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Hoare-and-Russo-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hoare and Russo 2009</LINK>). Movement based assessments such as the Melbourne Assessment and the QUEST provide valuable information on children's typical movement abilities.  These observations are critical for guiding muscle selection, directing post-injection therapy and providing objective data measuring change post-injection. In this review, three trials used the Melbourne Assesment to evaluate quality of movement following injection of BoNT-A (<LINK REF="STD-Boyd-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Boyd 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Speth-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Speth 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wallen-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Wallen 2007</LINK>) and four used the QUEST (<LINK REF="STD-Fehlings-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Fehlings 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Greaves-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Greaves 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lowe-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Lowe 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wallen-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Wallen 2007</LINK>). The trial by <LINK REF="STD-Wallen-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Wallen 2007</LINK> used both measures due to the broad age range of included children (2 to 14 years). The Melbourne Assessment has been validated for children aged 5 to 15 years and QUEST for children aged 18 months to 8 years. A recent study by <LINK REF="REF-Klingels-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Klingels 2008</LINK> demonstrated a high correlation between the Melbourne Assessment and the QUEST supporting the concurrent validity of the scales. <LINK REF="REF-Klingels-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Klingels 2008</LINK> also reported the Smallest Detectable Difference (SDD) for both measures. The SDD expresses the smallest change that must take place between two measurements for the test to detect a real change with 95% probability (<LINK REF="REF-Beckerman-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beckerman 2001</LINK>). The SDD was 8.99% for the Melbourne Assessment. For the QUEST total score the SDD was 7.11% and if only the hemiplegic side was measured, 13.8% SDD.</P>
<P>Data obtained from studies using a range of concentration and dosage schedules provided strong evidence that in young children with cerebral palsy, a combination of BoNT-A and occupational therapy was more effective than occupational therapy alone in improving activity-level outcomes measured using the QUEST (<LINK REF="STD-Fehlings-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Fehlings 2000</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Lowe-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Lowe 2006</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Wallen-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Wallen 2007</LINK>).  The pooled mean difference at initial post-injection follow-up and 3 month were greater than <LINK REF="REF-Klingels-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Klingels 2008</LINK> SDD of 7.11%. A lack of ongoing effect at 6 months on the QUEST suggests appropriate children may require re-injection into the upper limb more frequently than every 6 months.  The outcomes of a 3-phase multiple injection study by <LINK REF="STD-Olesch-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Olesch 2009</LINK>, will provide valuable information on this issue.  </P>
<P>The pooled data from the Melbourne Assessment did not demonstrate a treatment effect. The SDD was smaller than recommended by <LINK REF="REF-Klingels-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Klingels 2008</LINK> although the 95%CI for two of the trials (<LINK REF="STD-Boyd-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Boyd 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wallen-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Wallen 2007</LINK>) included the SDD suggesting further investigation is warranted. The small mean change in both groups at all time points for both these trials could indicate older children assessed using The Melbourne Assessment may not be as responsive to treatment using BoNT-A compared with younger children who were assessed using the QUEST. From another perspective, growth curve analysis of children with cerebral palsy by <LINK REF="REF-Hanna-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hanna 2003</LINK> using the QUEST indicated that all children, regardless of severity of impairment experienced a decline in QUEST scores from age 5 years. In this context, the improvements in children aged greater than 5 demonstrated by <LINK REF="STD-Wallen-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Wallen 2007</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Speth-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Speth 2005</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Boyd-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Boyd 2004</LINK>, despite being small, may have reversed a potential decline in function. Further longitudinal intervention trials and investigation of outcome measure responsiveness are required to address this issue. The current work establishing the validity of the Melbourne Assessment for children ages 2 to 4 years will also allow investigation of the influence of age following upper limb injection of BoNT-A (<LINK REF="REF-Randall-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Randall 2008</LINK>).</P>

<P>A reduction in muscle spasticity alone does not automatically confer improvements in a child's ability to use their affected upper limb(s) or perform daily tasks (<LINK REF="STD-Hurvitz-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Hurvitz 2000</LINK>). This review has provided evidence that a <I>combination</I> of BoNT-A and occupational therapy was able achieve greater change at both the body function/structure and activity levels compared with occupational therapy alone. Due to the nature of three included trials, this review was also able to investigate whether injection of <I>Botulinum toxin-A alone </I>was effective<I> </I>(<LINK REF="STD-Corry-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Corry 1997</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Koman-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Koman 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wallen-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Wallen 2007</LINK>)<I>. </I>Except for reduced spasticity in elbow flexor muscles at 2 weeks and goal attainment, data from <LINK REF="STD-Wallen-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Wallen 2007</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Koman-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Koman 2007</LINK> demonstrated injection of BoNT-A alone did not demonstrate a treatment effect on outcomes at the body function/structure or activity level domains. Thus, when compared with placebo or no treatment, there is moderate evidence that BoNT-A alone is not effective (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK> to <LINK REF="CMP-001.15" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.15</LINK>). It is therefore recommended upper limb injection of BoNT-A always be accompanied by pre-planned post-injection therapeutic intervention.</P>
<P>Spasticity in combination with sensorimotor deficits, poor selective motor control, mirror movements and weakness result in inefficient movements significantly limiting a child's ability to perform daily tasks (<LINK REF="REF-Eliasson-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eliasson 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kuhtz_x002d_Buschbeck-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kuhtz-Buschbeck 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vaz-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vaz 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hoare-and-Russo-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hoare and Russo 2009</LINK>).  In theory, by reducing spasticity and muscle tone, BoNT-A assists in establishing a balance between spastic and antagonist muscles (<LINK REF="STD-Hoare-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Hoare 2004</LINK>). In conjunction with appropriate therapy techniques, the improved muscle balance aims to create a window of opportunity to facilitate improved limb mobility, development of selective motor control and improved activity performance. In this review, post-injection therapy in studies evaluating the effects of BoNT-A and occupational therapy varied in intensity, type and timing (<LINK REF="STD-Fehlings-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Fehlings 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Boyd-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Boyd 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Greaves-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Greaves 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Speth-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Speth 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lowe-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Lowe 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Russo-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Russo 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wallen-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Wallen 2007</LINK>). These trials suggest however, that intensive bursts of occupational therapy in combination with BoNT-A produce the largest treatment effect of all upper limb interventions for children with hemiplegic CP (<LINK REF="REF-Sakzewski-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sakzewski 2009</LINK>). As suggested by Hoare in 2004, further work is required to establish the timing, intensity and specific type of therapy that will enhance functional outcomes and prolong the beneficial effects of BoNT-A (<LINK REF="STD-Hoare-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Hoare 2004</LINK>). Due to the heterogeneity of children with cerebral palsy, a single therapy type will not be appropriate for all children and choice of therapies will depend on age, the child and family goals, the presenting symptoms and the severity of impairments. Prior to establishment of strong evidence for post-injection therapy intervention, clinicians are advised to adopt the paediatric upper limb hypertonicity BoNT-A evidence-based guidelines for intervention and after-care (<LINK REF="REF-Fehlings-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fehlings 2009</LINK>). This international consensus statement provides assistance to clinicians managing children with upper limb hypertonicity by outlining best practice in assessment, dosing, injection techniques, and adjunctive interventions, based on evidence where available and the expert opinion of the authors (<LINK REF="REF-Fehlings-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fehlings 2009</LINK>).</P>

<B>Effects on activity level outcomes (global function and goal setting)</B>
</P>
<P>
<I>
<B>Considerations for assessment of global function </B>
</I>
</P>
<P>A fundamental principle of any evaluation of intervention is to measure change at the level targeted by the intervention. The use of intramuscular injection of BoNT-A targets reduction of muscle spasticity. BoNT-A, when coupled with movement-based therapies, also targets improvement in hand skills, effectiveness of the limb(s) in performance of daily activities and functional goal achievement. Results from trials included in this review have demonstrated favourable outcomes in these areas for children receiving BoNT-A and occupational therapy. However, can clinicians expect <I>clinical change</I> on global measures of function such as the PEDI or the WeeFIM within 6 months? In 2003, <LINK REF="REF-Iyer-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Iyer 2003</LINK> reported change scores of about 11% for the PEDI appear to be clinically meaningful. In this review, no trial demonstrated change of this magnitude on the PEDI. Greatest mean change 10.6% (SD 15.1) was demonstrated by <LINK REF="STD-Wallen-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Wallen 2007</LINK> in the <I>occupational therapy alone</I> group at 6 months. As a result, this review has provided evidence that upper limb injection of BoNT-A, with or without occupational therapy, does not show a clinically significant improvement in global function in children with cerebral palsy as measured by the PEDI (<LINK REF="STD-Boyd-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Boyd 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wallen-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Wallen 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lowe-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Lowe 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fehlings-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Fehlings 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Speth-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Speth 2005</LINK>) or WeeFIM (<LINK REF="STD-Koman-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Koman 2007</LINK>). Given the nature of the intervention, and the relatively short duration of follow-up in the included trials, the lack of change on outcomes measuring global function is not surprising. Future trials evaluating upper limb injection of BoNT-A in children with cerebral palsy should consider the level targeted by this focal intervention and question the inclusion of global measures of function such as the PEDI and WeeFIM.</P>
<P>
<I>
<B>Consideration for occupational performance and goal setting outcomes</B>
</I>
</P>
<P>The Canadian Occupational Performance Measure (COPM) is an individualised standardised outcome measure designed to detect change in a person's occupational performance following intervention.  The COPM is a useful tool for identifying and prioritising performance concerns and setting goals pre and post-injection of BoNT-A.  Goals set using the COPM can be scaled using the Goal Attainment Scaling (GAS).  This complimentary approach enables goal identification, articulation and measurement (<LINK REF="REF-Fehlings-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fehlings 2009</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Cusick_x002c_-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cusick, 2006</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Hoare-and-Imms-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hoare and Imms 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>Four studies included in this review used both the COPM and GAS to measure occupational performance and goal attainment following upper limb injection of BoNT-A (<LINK REF="STD-Boyd-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Boyd 2004</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Greaves-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Greaves 2004</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Lowe-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Lowe 2006</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Wallen-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Wallen 2007</LINK>). Additonally, the study by <LINK REF="STD-Russo-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Russo 2007</LINK> independently used the GAS. These studies demonstrated that children who received BoNT-A and occupational therapy compared with occupational therapy alone, achieved greater goal attainment.  Longer-term outcomes however, were only demonstrated in the trial by <LINK REF="STD-Lowe-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Lowe 2006</LINK> using a higher concentration of BoNT-A (200U Botox®/1.0ml saline).  Limited data from <LINK REF="STD-Lowe-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Lowe 2006</LINK> also supports improved satisfaction with performance on important daily activities identified using the COPM, however this did not extend beyond the period of chemo-denervation (i.e. 3 to 6 months).</P>
<P>Despite the emerging popularity of using the GAS to evaluate change following upper limb injection of BoNT-A, the validity and reliability of GAS is largely unknown (<LINK REF="REF-Steenbeek-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Steenbeek 2007</LINK>). Validity has been questioned, due to dependence on the skills of therapist who set the goals, their objectivity, ability to select realistic goals and anticipate outcomes following a specific intervention (<LINK REF="REF-McLaren-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">McLaren 2003</LINK>). With regard to sensitivity to change, <LINK REF="REF-Steenbeek-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Steenbeek 2007</LINK> reports that the responsiveness of GAS "depends on whether therapists and parents select goals and levels of attainment for each goal that represent clinically important changes in future performance" (<LINK REF="REF-Steenbeek-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Steenbeek 2007</LINK>, p. 553). This judgement is a problematic aspect of reliability for the GAS and a potential source of bias due to overestimation or underestimation of potential for change. For example, prior to intervention, scaling of goals using the GAS is undertaken by assessors in conjunction with children and their families. Subjectively, scales or levels of achievement, are determined based on the child's current performance of a task and their expected outcome. Inherently, despite attempts to enhance objectivity, such as video recording a child's baseline performance of tasks, goal setting in a single-blind intervention trial remains a subjective process. That is, children and families awareness of treatment to be received and potential pre-conceived expectations for outcomes can serve as a positive bias for children receiving intervention. When comparing injections of <I>BoNT-A alone with no treatment</I>, the trial by <LINK REF="STD-Wallen-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Wallen 2007</LINK> demonstrated no treatment effect on body function/structure outcomes, except for a reduction in elbow flexor spasticity at 2 weeks following injection. Activity level outcomes such as the QUEST, The Melbourne Assessment, and PEDI also demonstrated no treatment effect. During the period of chemo-denervation effect for BoNT-A (&lt;6 months following injection) however, parents in the BoNT-A alone group rated their child&#8217;s performance and satisfaction of identified goals significantly higher than the no treatment group using the COPM.  Using the GAS, children receiving BoNT-A alone also achieved significantly greater activity-level goal attainment at 3 months, persisting at 6 months post-injection. The trial by <LINK REF="STD-Wallen-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Wallen 2007</LINK> used therapists unblinded to group assignment for COPM and GAS adminstration and scoring. Considering the small change on other activity level outcomes, results for COPM and GAS should therefore be tempered by the potential bias due to a lack of blinding.</P>
<P>Using data from studies evaluating change following injection of BoNT-A in adults, <LINK REF="REF-Ashford-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ashford 2006</LINK> suggests a change in GAS T-score of more than 10 appears to be associated with clinically important change. However when comparing injections of <I>BoNT-A alone with no treatment, </I>
<LINK REF="STD-Wallen-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Wallen 2007</LINK>
<I> </I>demonstrated that children receiving only their usual treatment in the community (no treatment group) demonstrated a group mean change of 12.87 (SD 10.25) at 3 months and 20.54 (SD 11.99) at 6 months (<LINK REF="CMP-001.13" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.13</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Wallen-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Wallen 2007</LINK> reported these changes may be associated with time and development during the trial, the usual community based therapy received, or identification of clear goals on which to focus. Whatever the reason, further development of the GAS is necessary (<LINK REF="REF-Steenbeek-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Steenbeek 2007</LINK>), particularly establishing reliability, validity and level of clinically important change in children with cerebral palsy. Meanwhile, future studies using the GAS to evaluate BoNT-A in children with cerebral palsy should consider formalised training of those scaling goals and rating performance and reporting of such training in research papers (<LINK REF="REF-Cusick_x002c_-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cusick, 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Steenbeek-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Steenbeek 2007</LINK>) and analysing GAS ordinal data using non-parametric statistics (<LINK REF="REF-Tennant-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tennant 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<B>Effects on self competence, quality of life and participation</B>
</P>
<P>There was some evidence that occupational therapy alone enhanced self-perception of peer and maternal acceptance (but not other aspects of self-competence) in very young children 3 months after intervention when compared with children who received BoNT-A and occupational therapy (<LINK REF="STD-Russo-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Russo 2007</LINK>).  There was no evidence of a difference between groups at 6 months on measures of health related quality of life (<LINK REF="STD-Boyd-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Boyd 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wallen-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Wallen 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Russo-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Russo 2007</LINK>). As with measures of global function, given the nature of the specific intervention in these trials, and the relatively short duration of follow-up, the lack of change on these outcomes measuring is not surprising.</P>
<P>Participation, defined by <LINK REF="REF-WHO-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2001</LINK> as involvement in a life situation, is both a subjective and objective experience. Participation is influenced by both the sociocultural environments in which a child and family live and maturational and developmental changes (<LINK REF="REF-Coster-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Coster 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Humphrey-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Humphrey 2002</LINK>). Patterns of participation are therefore established according to a child&#8217;s inner drive or interest in an activity, opportunities, and exposure to activities (<LINK REF="REF-Wiseman-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wiseman 2005</LINK>). To date, effects on a child's participation following injection of BoNT-A with/without occupational therapy are unknown. No study included in this review used outcomes measuring change within the participation domain. As <LINK REF="REF-Imms-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Imms 2008</LINK> suggest, understanding the complexity of children&#8217;s participation requires an overview of what children are choosing to do, how often, and in what environments. This is much broader than simply measuring a child's capacity and performance in activities. Ultimately, injection of BoNT-A coupled with occupational therapy in the upper limb in children with cerebral palsy targets a reduction in impairment and improvement in activity level outcomes. Effects on a child's inner drive, interest in an activity, opportunities, and exposure to activities may not be directly influenced by a reduction in impairment and improvement in activity level outcomes. Emerging evidence from an RCT evaluating two types of upper limb interventions for children with cerebral palsy provides support for this suggestion (<LINK REF="REF-Carlon-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carlon 2009</LINK>). Again, future trials should consider the level targeted by interventions and focus measurement accordingly.</P>
<P>
<U>
<B>Dosage, concentration and injection method</B>
</U>
</P>
<P>Despite more positive, longer-term outcomes demonstrated by <LINK REF="STD-Lowe-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Lowe 2006</LINK> using higher concentration, low volume BoNT-A (200U Botox®/1.0ml saline) in comparison to the other trials, <LINK REF="STD-Kawamura-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Kawamura 2007</LINK> who specifically evaluated whether <I>the effect of BoNT-A was dose dependent </I>did not provide similar support for using higher concentration of BoNT-A. Evidence following injection of BoNT-A in adult biceps muscles support this outcome with high-volume (low concentration) or endplate targeted injections achieving greater neuromuscular blockade, cocontraction, spasticity reduction, and greater active range of elbow extension than low-volume (high concentration), non-targeted injections (<LINK REF="REF-Gracies-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gracies 2009</LINK>). The results for <LINK REF="STD-Kawamura-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Kawamura 2007</LINK> suggesting a small trend for maintenance of grip strength and improved functional skills measured using PEDI for the low dose BoNT-A group should be viewed in light of limited data obtained from a single study and inadequate muscle localisation technique using palpation (<LINK REF="REF-Chin-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chin 2005</LINK>). Currently there is no evidence to support or refute specific injection techniques, concentration or dosage for BoNT-A in the upper limb in children with cerebral palsy. At this time, clinicians are advised to adopt the recommendations for dosage, dilution and injection technique outlined in the paediatric upper limb hypertonicity BoNT-A evidence-based guidelines for intervention and after-care (<LINK REF="REF-Fehlings-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fehlings 2009</LINK>)</P>
<P>
<U>
<B>Safety of upper limb BoNT-A injections</B>
</U>
</P>
<P>There have been several case-reports of serious systemic adverse events following injections of BoNTA in children with cerebral palsy. <LINK REF="REF-Howell-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Howell 2007</LINK> reported a case of a 9 year old boy with cerebral palsy (GMFCS V) who developed stridor, increased work of breathing, vomiting and decreased tolerance of oral feeds following 4 separate injection sessions of Botox® (total dose 400 units or 40U/kg on each occasion). It was hypothesised that due to pre-existing bulbar dysfunction, this child may have had greater sensitivity to very small amounts of systemic BoNT-A. A recommendation for lower doses such as 4&#8211;8 units/kg was suggested.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Crowner-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Crowner 2007</LINK> reported a 3 year old girl (11.8kg) with cerebral palsy whose breathing and swallowing function deteriorated following a single injection of Botox® (400U or 40U/kg). This child also developed severe generalized weakness 1 month post injection and experienced a decline in her functional abilities. All symptoms resolved and following this injection session, the child received injections of Botox® on 7 further occasions (Total dose 200-300U (17.7 to 20.0U/kg). Following these injections the child's mother did not report side effects. The authors report that this case is consistent with the findings of <LINK REF="REF-Scott-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scott 1988</LINK> where it was reported that 40 U/kg of BoNTA intramuscular injections in monkeys causes systemic toxicity resembling botulism.<BR/>
</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Goldstein-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goldstein 2006</LINK> reported symptoms of mild systemic botulism (fatigue, ptosis, diplopia, and dysarthria) in a 13-year-old child with cerebral palsy who received 23U/kg of Botox® into a lower extremity. The symptoms resolved within 6 weeks. Further injection of BoNTA at a lower dosage resulted in no adverse events.<BR/>
</P>
<P>In February, 2008 the United States Food and Drug Administration received reports of systemic adverse reactions to BoNTA including respiratory compromise and death following the use of botulinum toxins types A and B for both FDA-approved and unapproved uses. The FDA suggests these adverse reactions occurred due to botulism as a result of diffusion of BoNTA from the site of injection. Doses for children ranged from 6.25 to 32 Units/kilogram (U/kg).</P>
<P>The <LINK REF="REF-U.S-Food-and-Drug-Administration" TYPE="REFERENCE">U.S Food and Drug Administration</LINK> recommend that until such time it has completed its review, healthcare professionals who use medicinal botulinum toxins should:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Understand that potency determinations expressed in &#8220;Units&#8221; or &#8220;U&#8221; are different among the different botulinum toxin products; clinical doses expressed in units are not comparable from one botulinum product to the next.</LI>
<LI>Be alert to the potential for systemic effects following administration of botulinum toxins such as: dysphagia, dysphonia, weakness, dyspnoea or respiratory distress.</LI>
<LI>Understand that these effects have been reported as early as one day and as late as several weeks after treatment.</LI>
<LI>Provide patients and caregivers with the information they need to identify the signs and symptoms of systemic effects after receiving an injection of a botulinum toxin.</LI>
<LI>Inform patients they should receive immediate medical attention if they have worsening or unexpected difficulty swallowing or talking, trouble breathing, or muscle weakness.</LI>
</UL>
<P>Data from the trials included in this review indicate very few adverse events for the use of BoNT-A in the treatment of upper limb spasticity in children with cerebral palsy (<LINK REF="TBL-12" TYPE="TABLE">Table 12</LINK>). The authors of this review however, recommend clinicians continue following the guidelines outlined by the <LINK REF="REF-U.S-Food-and-Drug-Administration" TYPE="REFERENCE">U.S Food and Drug Administration</LINK> when providing intramuscular upper limb injection of BoNT-A to children with cerebral palsy.</P>

<P>This systematic review found high level evidence to support the use of BoNT-A as an adjunct to occupational therapy in managing the upper limb in children with spastic cerebral palsy. When compared with placebo or no treatment, there is moderate evidence that BoNT-A alone is not effective. It is recommended that intramuscular injection of BoNT-A in the upper limb be administered using muscle localisation methods such as electrical stimulation or ultrasound guidance (<LINK REF="REF-Chin-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chin 2005</LINK>) and always be accompanied by planned post-injection therapeutic intervention. Injection of BoNT-A in the upper limb at concentrations ranging from 50U Botox® /1.0ml saline to 200U Botox® /1ml saline with a dose from 0.5U to 16U/kg body weight up to a total of 220 to 410 Units (Botox®) has demonstrated safety in this population with minimal adverse events.  Clinicians are advised to adopt the paediatric upper limb hypertonicity BoNT-A evidence-based guidelines for intervention and after-care (<LINK REF="REF-Fehlings-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fehlings 2009</LINK>).</P>

<P>Randomised controlled trial comparing BoNT-A and occupational therapy/physiotherapy with occupational therapy/physiotherapy only. Blinded rater for one primary outcome (Melbourne Assessment). Treating therapists were not blinded to group allocation. Children were matched by age and Zancolli classification. One child of every pair was random allocated to either BoNT-A or control group. The other child was automatically assigned to the other group. Allocation concealment was maintained using opaque envelopes and using an independent officer to select the envelope. Follow-up at 2 and 6 weeks and 3, 6 and 9 months.</P>

<P>Both Groups<BR/>30 minutes physiotherapy and 30 minutes occupational therapy three times a week for 6 months. A treatment protocol including strength and coordination and task specific training was made for each level of hand function impairment (Zancolli grade). This was tailored to the individual child based on individual goal setting and clinical reasoning. All children wore a night splint. During the day children with Zancolli IIB wore a cock-up splint almost all day. Children with less impairment used a wrist cock-up splint or web-space splint only during specific activities.</P>

<P>
<B>Aim</B>: Botulinum toxin A injections and orthotics have been used to manage upper extremity spasticity in hemiplegic children. The authors performed a study to evaluate the necessity and effectiveness of a static night splint following outpatient botulinum toxin-A treatment in children with upper limb spastic cerebral palsy.</P>

<P>
<B>Results:</B> After botulinum toxin A treatment, both groups showed an improvement on their previous functional level of the injected upper extremity. At 2 months, children in group A showed a 15.4% improvement, whereas children in group B improved by 12.2% from baseline; these were not statistically significant (P=0.326). At 6 months, group A still maintained a 15.9% improvement in function compared to group B which differed only by 4.2% from pre botulinum toxin A baseline; these differences were statistically significant (P=0.001). Complications related to the botulinum toxin A injection were not observed. The static night upper extremity splints have been well tolerated by the hemiplegic children.</P>
<P>Authors Conclusions: Static night splinting following botulinum toxin A injections has shown a definite treatment effect in reducing spasticity and improving function in children with upper limb spastic cerebral palsy.</P>

<P>
<B>Method:</B> Isometric manual force generation was measured with a finger and wrist flexor isometric force task. Outcome measures of the isometric force task were maximal generated flexor force (MGF), generated force (GF), and over- or undershoots over a large range of force levels (12&#8211;60% of the MGF).<BR/>Clinical outcome measures were active and passive range of motion (ROM), stretch restricted angle, and Ashworth scores of elbow and wrist. Measurements were performed at baseline, 2 weeks after BoNT-A, 3 and 6 months (end of therapy), and 3 months after termination of the therapy. Participants completed the 6-month therapy programme according to the therapy protocol, based on motor learning principles, strength training principles, and principles of muscle mobilization. Botox from Allergan was used (dilution 5 /0.1ml).</P>

<P>
<B>Results:</B> A trend of changes was seen for active ROM of wrist. GF decreased directly after the BoNT-A injection. Increase of GF occurred during the therapy period. The therapy group showed a higher increase during the therapy period (F(4,72)=3.80, p=0.007) compared with the therapy and BoNT-A group. The therapy and BoNT-A group only showed undershoots during total therapy period. The therapy group changed from a small amount of undershoots to a small amount of overshoots at the end of the therapy period<BR/>(F(4,72)=1.39, p=0.002).</P>
<P>
<BR/>
<B>Authors Conclusions:</B> This research demonstrates that manual isometric flexor force increases by standardized functional therapy during a therapy period of 6 months. After BoNT-A a reduced muscle force was seen, but increase occurred during therapy. Furthermore, a continuous amount of undershoots can be seen in the therapy and BoNT-A group, whereas the therapy group showed a change from undershoots to a small amount of overshoots. Measurement of maximal muscle strength and the possibility to generate the force in simple isometric manual force tasks has to be taken into account in the clinical decision for the use of BTX-A.</P>

<B>Title:</B> Effect of upper limb botulinum toxin-A therapy on health-related quality of life in children with hemiplegic cerebral palsy.<BR/>
</P>
<P>
<B>Hypothesis: </B>Currently, the use of upper limb BoNT-A is based on evidence of functional ef&#64257;cacy without supporting evidence of positive change in health-related quality of life (HRQOL). While function may improve, this cannot be directly correlated with an improvement in HRQOL.</P>
<P>
<B>Objective:</B> To study the effect of UL BoNT-A therapy on HRQOL in children with hemiplegic cerebral palsy (CP)</P>
<P>
<B>Method: </B>Pilot prospective randomised trial. Participants were randomised into treatment and non-treatment (control) groups using non-marked sealed envelopes.</P>
<P>
<B>Outcome Measures: </B>HRQOL assessed at baseline, and 1, 3 and 6 months post-injection by completion of Pediatric Quality of Life (PedsQL) 4.0 Generic Core Scales and PedsQL 3.0 CP Module. Outcome: 1. Change in PedsQL scores. 2. Concordance between child self-report and parent proxy-report scores.</P>
<P>
<B>Data Analysis: </B>The treatment and control groups were compared at baseline. Student&#8217;s t-tests were performed to compare age and function, and Fisher&#8217;s exact test was performed to compare gender. The concordance between PedsQL child self-report and parent proxy-report scores was determined through Spearman correlation coef&#64257;cients (SCCs). Intraclass correlations (ICCs) were designated as follows: &lt;0.40 poor to fair agreement, 0.41&#8211; 0.60 moderate agreement, 0.61&#8211;0.80 good agreement and 0.81&#8211;1.00 excellent agreement.

<P>Treatment protocol<BR/>Twelve participants in the treatment group received one series of intramuscular injections of BoNT-A at the commencement of the study. The dosage of BoNT-A was 0.5&#8211;2 U/kg body weight/UL muscle group, with a maximum dosage of 12 U/kg body weight inclusive of lower limb BoNT-A administered. UL muscle selection for injection was individualised based on a review of a videotape of a functional assessment (Quality of Upper Extremities Skills Test).<BR/>

<P>Authors conclusions: This pilot work adds to the emerging evidence that UL BoNT-A therapy has no statistically significant effect on the HRQOL of children with hemiplegic CP. With the increasing use of this therapy in children with CP, further research across the broader CP population is needed to identify whether this therapy is indicated in other target populations. Both child and parent proxy reports should be collected when assessing HRQOL in this population..<BR/>

<P>
<B>Hypothesis: </B>BoNT-A is being increasingly used as a lower limb spasticity management tool in CP. While there is increasing evidence of its e&#64259;cacy for upper limb spasticity, little is known about the mechanisms underlying any improvement in motor function. It is likely there are changes at the neuromuscular level as well as adaptive changes in the central nervous system.<BR/>

<P>Authors Conclusions: Corticomotor projections associated with the upper limb in children with hemiplegic CP show significant variability over a 6-month period. This variability may re&#64258;ect central motor reorganization because of systemic BoNT-Ae&#64256;ect or developmental changes. Upper limb BoNT-A therapy is associated with reorganization of both a&#64256;ected and una&#64256;ected projections. Poor tolerance of the TMS procedure, in conjunction with higher cortical thresholds, may limit the usefulness of TMS as an investigatory tool in young children with movement disorders.</P>

<P>

<BR/>Date received: 24th April 2006<BR/>Cite this comment as: http://www.cochranefeedback.com/cf/cda/citation.do?id=9511#9511<BR/>
<BR/>We would like to comment on the systematic review by Wasiak et al in the Cochrane Library: "Botulinum Toxin A as an Adjunct to Treatment in the Management of the Upper Limb in Children with Spastic Cerebral Palsy." We were pleased to note that our randomized controlled trial evaluating the impact of Botulinum Toxin on hand function in children with hemiplegia (one of only two articles) was included in the analysis (1). We are concerned; however, by the conclusions reached by the Cochrane reviewers. Our analyses identified a significant improvement in the Quality of Upper Extremity Skills Test (QUEST) scores in the Botox group, compared with controls. Therefore, we were disappointed and surprised to note that the Cochrane reviewers came to a different conclusion, i.e., no effect of Botox on QUEST scores. As is outlined below, we believe our analyses to be correct.<BR/>
<BR/>The difference between the two results is readily explainable. We completed our main analysis of the QUEST scores based on analysis of changes from baseline. In contrast, the Cochrane reviewers used the raw QUEST scores in their analysis without adjusting for baseline. Our primary data are described in Table 1 and Figure 1. Figures 1 and 2 can be accessed by the following link: www.bloorviewmacmillan.on.ca/webpdfs/CochraneResponse.doc.The two least squares fitted lines in Figure 1 are clearly parallel with slopes of 0.93 and 0.85 (p = 0.75) and a combined slope of 0.90. The post treatment QUEST scores for the treatment group are generally larger than the control group.<BR/>
<BR/>Table 1: Primary Data Set for QUEST<BR/>Treatment Group (n=14): Baseline 19.2 (SD 15.1), 1 month post 32.5 (SD 17.8), Change(pre/post) 13.3 (SD 12.6) Control Group(n=15): Baseline 27.6 (SD 19.0), 1 month post 29.3 (SD 20.4), Change (pre/post)1.7 (SD 10.1)<BR/>Correlation (r)between pre and post scores = 0.8<BR/>Baseline Comparability (p-value)= 0.20<BR/>
<BR/>To compensate for the baseline differences in the QUEST scores between the two groups, we analysed the change in QUEST scores rather than the actual QUEST scores using a 2-way analysis of variance of baseline, one, three and six month measurements. We found significant differences favouring the treatment group that received Botulinum toxin on the QUEST scores (F = 4.69, df 1,83, p = 0.039) with post hoc testing reaching significance at one month (p = 0.01). If we reanalyze our data using the change in QUEST scores for each group from baseline to one month only, we also find a significant difference favouring the treatment group (independent samples t test t=2.75, df 27, p = 0.01). In contrast, the Cochrane reviewers did not take baseline differences in QUEST scores into account, but rather tested for differences in QUEST scores at one month only.<BR/>
<BR/>The ideal scientific study involves the comparison of groups that are alike in all respects except for the intervention or treatment. Ideally comparisons should be made between individuals with similar baseline scores and this might be achieved at the design stage or in the analysis by using an adjustment technique. It is also well known that even when baseline differences between the comparison groups are not statistically significant the baseline variable can still be a confounder because the size of the confounding effect is a product of the size of that baseline difference and the size of the slope that describes the relation between the baseline and post treatment measurements.<BR/>
<BR/>Research is available to guide decision-making when there are baseline differences in outcome measures in randomized trials. For example, statisticians have assessed the robustness of different methods, such as comparing post treatment scores only (Cochrane approach), change scores (our method), percentage change, and analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). The "best" method as defined by low type 1 and type 2 errors, is dependent on the correlation between pre and post treatment scores and the size of the baseline difference between the two groups (2-5). In our data set, the control group had a higher baseline QUEST score, the correlation between pre and post QUEST treatment scores was r = 0.8 and the baseline QUEST difference between groups (t-test) had a p-value of 0.20. When the baseline value of the outcome measure in the treatment group is less than the control group and the test for baseline differences between the groups has a p-value in the range of 0.05 to 0.25, the type 1 error for the change scores approach is appropriate at 0.057 (2). For type 2 errors, or conversely power, when the correlation of pre and post scores is high (r=0.8) the change score approach has a high statistical power of 0.86 to detect differences (2,3). Therefore, for the conditions of our data set, the analysis of change scores had both an appropriate type 1 error rate and high statistical power. An ANCOVA analysis is also appropriate for our data The adjusted difference of the QUEST means favouring the Botox group is significant at 10.79, SE 4.4, p = 0.02. In addition, the group effect was not modified by the baseline QUEST value (a group * baseline interaction term was non-significant in an analysis of covariance model, with a p value of 0.75) indicating the treatment effect of BTA was seen across a wide range of baseline hand function. In contrast, comparing post treatment scores only (as used in the Cochrane review of our data), is not statistically efficient as the power to detect change with this method is low at 0.43 (2).<BR/>
<BR/>An additional criticism of the approach taken by this Cochrane review is that it did not follow the Cochrane's "preferred method for handling continuous variables" as outlined in the Cochrane Handbook (www.epi.bris.ac.uk/cochrane/Information/Resources/stats3.html). The recommended approach is to calculate a weighted mean difference that assesses the mean change from baseline to follow-up, and includes the standard deviation of the mean difference of the variable. These values are then entered into RevMan (the Cochrane collaboration software for conducting systematic reviews and meta-analysis). This Cochrane review ignored the baseline values of our data and used one-month post testing only. They did not request information from the authors on the standard deviation of the mean difference, nor did they attempt to estimate or impute from a combination of available information and empirical data, for example using Follmann's method (6), described in version 4.2.5 of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions, pp. 119-122. Instead the authors have entered only the post mean and SD for the QUEST into RevMan. The implication of ignoring the baseline data, as the authors Wasiak et al did, is highlighted in Figure 2 (link to www.bloorviewmacmillan.on.ca/webpdfs/CochraneResponse.doc)where we have followed the Cochrane "preferred method for handling continuous variables" and entered the correct values (sample size, mean difference, and standard deviation of the mean difference in each treatment arm) of our data into RevMan. The results favouring BTA at one-month post are highly significant with a p value of 0.006.<BR/>
<BR/>Based on the above, we stand by our conclusion that children with hemiplegia receiving botulinum toxin and occupational therapy improve the quality of their hand function more than children receiving occupational therapy alone. We respectfully challenge the conclusions reached by the Cochrane reviewers and assert that the analyses used in our RCT were valid and based on sound statistical principles. We request that Wasiak et al revise their review and conclusions.<BR/>

<FEEDBACK_REPLY MODIFIED="2009-05-14 21:35:46 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Brian J Hoare">
<P>Thank you very much for your detailed feedback in April 2006 regarding our Cochrane systematic review titled, "Botulinum toxin A as an adjunct to treatment in the management of the upper limb in children with spastic cerebral palsy". We sincerely apologise for the delay in our response, however your feedback has resulted in broad discussion and correspondence with many people.<BR/>
<BR/>In summary, your feedback related to the type of data used in the analysis section of our review. We compared post treatment scores at specific time point for all outcomes including the QUEST, PEDI, PROM, grip strength and MAS. Your feedback questioned why change scores from baseline were not used. This would allow the consideration of baseline differences between groups, important in studies such as yours with a small sample size and a heterogeneous population. As you correctly report, the result obtained using change data from your study is very different to that obtained using post-treatment scores only. This has a significant impact on the outcome and conclusion of the review.<BR/>
<BR/>As you are aware, the Cochrane process follows explicit methods and criteria. When this particular review was being developed in 2002/2003, we made the decision to use between group mean data at specific time points. You have correctly described this in your feedback as the "Cochrane Approach" and this methodology was not challenged during the peer review process. More recently however, following extensive discussions amongst ourselves and the editorial team of the Movement Disorders Review Group, the Criticism Editor, Dr Peter Moore has advised our review team to take into account the baseline performance of children. On this advice and prompted by your feedback our review team will be using mean change data in the update of the review which is currently being undertaken.<BR/>
<BR/>Could we impose upon you to provide us with the information we require to complete the revision of the review using change data. We will need data that includes mean change and the standard deviation of the mean change for all measures at all time points (0, 1, 3 and 6 months): QUEST, PEDI, PROM, grip strength and MAS. We would very appreciative of any information you are able to provide to us.<BR/>
<BR/>Thank you again for your feedback. It has lead to broad ranging discussion of many important issues relating to the use of data in studies relating to children with cerebral palsy. Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any queries regarding this letter or our review. Your assistance with this review will help us present and deliver the best available evidence to those health care professionals working in clinical practice and those who wish to pursue clinical research.<BR/>
