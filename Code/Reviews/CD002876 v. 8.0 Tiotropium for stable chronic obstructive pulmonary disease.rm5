Text returned to previous state and this can now be submitted. Thanks for all the hard work on this.&lt;br&gt;Chris.&lt;br&gt;++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++&lt;br&gt;CJC responses to Peer review comments 20/1/2005&lt;br&gt;The main thrust of the peer review comments was that Tiotropium was licensed for its effects as a bronchodilator. This is true but the protocol specified primary patient centred outcomes and we need to stick with this. A few minor alterations to wording have also be made in red. I think it is important to clinicians to emphasis the single study that allows LABA as a co-intervention in the graphs as well as the text and would therefore propose making a fourth subgroup for the Neiwoehner study so that further studies that allow LABA as a co-intervention can be easily separated out by the viewer when they are added in future. I have not taken this study out of the summary estimate, but the latter decision will need to be revisited when the review is updated as I think the addition of Tiotropium to LABA is a different clinical question and needs a separate answer for those of us on the coal-face! Please look at the meta view plots for comparisons 1,3,5 and I have altered the text of the main results to separate out this trial as well. I have also changed the CI to x, y rather than x-y so it is not confused with negative signs.&lt;br&gt;If you are both happy with this we can submit it, please let Toby know asap!&lt;br&gt;Chris.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;============================================================================================================&lt;br&gt;Editing CJC 16 Dec 2004&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Hi Chris, Thanks again for the help. Please see specific responses below. There was one major item we disagreed with. I have changed the text accordingly and left in RED any areas of alteration that differed from your additions. I hope that this &amp;#8216;finalises&amp;#8217; it and you can get it out for peer review. Thanks, Graham&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Red text checked. Efficacy is tested in trials not effectiveness (what happens in real life) so I have changed this back. Thanks for expanding the section on NNT calculation to make it clearer in the methods. I have made clear which study allowed LABA as a co-intervention, and wonder if this should really be a 4th subgroup as it is answering a different clinical question. There is no Table 1 and 2 so I have altered this to table of included studies and excluded studies. Search strategy adjusted by Liz.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Issues remain over the combination of results from short trials (1-3 months) and longer trials (12 months) is suitable for exacerbations and hospitalisations, and whether the single trial allowing LABA as a co-intervetion should be in a separate subgroup, but I will see what the peer reviewers think about this. The text of the discussion brings out the latter issue anyway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Toby, could this go for peer review now please?&lt;br&gt;Chris.&lt;br&gt;_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________&lt;br&gt;Editing by CJC 2 dec 2004&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Authors' Contribution: fine. I think Phillipa has contributed significantly to this review and should be asked if she would like to be added to the author list.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Objectives: Fine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;References: fine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Table of included studies: excellent&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Metaview Labels: fine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Synopsis: fine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abstract ; excellent. Minor alterations in red.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Liz will check the search strategy. Did you consider calculating a one year NNT from the pooled Odds Ratio and exacerbation rates in the control arms for one year trials, I have added a sentence about this in red and also to the results? See red sentence in results section.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Good (NNT added with figure 2 and 3 - hope you approve? Also added to the abstract! The heterogeneity in FEV1 clearly stems from the salmeterol trial so this supports your argument for the compromise position of not pooling salmeterol with the other groups. I have added a note on where the heterogeneity comes from. Note added in red to explain possible funnel plot implication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Discussion: &amp;quot;The magnitude of the reduction in exacerbation-related hospitalisations with tiotropium was similar in comparison to placebo or ipratropium and salmeterol (althougth the latter comparison did not attain statistical significance) and was similar in the large placebo-controlled trials that did and did not permit continuation of long-acting b-agonists during the trial.&amp;quot; I am not happy with this. There is not enough power to tell if salmeterol is different to the other drugs in this outcome. It is different in terms of lung function. This is implying similarity which is not in my view justified and I have therefore removed this sentence. &lt;br&gt;The QOL data did not show statistical significance in relation to Salmeterol - hence red text added. Have I got this wrong?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Contentious issues: although it would be purer to keep placebo and ipratropium separate I think the current compromise works and am happy to accept your arguments for it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spellchecked: Done&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next action: I am delighted that this review has been completed and am keen to get it out for peer review in time for the next deadline. Please could the authors check my proposed changes and get back to Toby asap so that we can proceed with this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;________________________________________________________________________________________________________&lt;br&gt;GB November 2004&lt;br&gt;Apologies for the longer delay in responding to your comments. We have revised the tio review according to your recommendations and all authors have signed off on the revised draft. I hope that you will find that we have responded adequately and that our justification for point #1 below is persuasive. I think that your comments were reasonable and our current approach is defensible. Given that there&amp;#8217;s wide agreement that ipra does nothing for decline in lung function and hospitalizations, I don&amp;#8217;t think the clinicians will have difficulty interpreting the combined control group of plac+ipra. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Please find the revised draft attached. I hope that we can move ahead toward publication of this important review soon.&lt;br&gt;Many thanks for your helpful comments.&lt;br&gt;Best regards, Graham&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PP Sept 04&lt;br&gt;With respect to #1 - it still looks like an attempt to gain power, by combining comparisons with different controls-and we disagree as to whether this is an acceptable thing to do, as I am not 100% clear in my mind what it actually means. Your tio/ipra/placebo suggestion is a bit more palatable! Unfortunately the readers including industry may not be able to appreciate what a summary means- you do need to point this out clearly. Needs much more of the justifications you have made here, PLUS a statement that clinically this does not mean that tio is better than everything else. Perhaps the main value of the summary stat is in looking at the natural history of the disorder of those defined with more modern COPD criteria, rather than in comparing therapies.&lt;br&gt;It should also be mentioned that this is a deviation from the initial protocol, and why you have done it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chris Cates will need to make the final decision to approve it for the Cochrane Library, so how about you resend the updated version to me, then I'll send on to Chris.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;GB Aug 04&lt;br&gt;Thank you for your helpful comments. I have made revisions in response to your comments #2 through #6, but am still struggling with #1. &lt;br&gt;Results from the Lung Health Study show fairly definitively that ipra is no better than placebo for slowing longterm decline in lung function (Anthonisen, JAMA, 1994) and for reducing COPD-related hospitalizations (Anthonisen, AJRCCM, 2002). I&amp;#8217;m not aware of any longterm trials of ipra vs placebo that suggest otherwise. A priori, we would expect therefore that the tio-placebo and tio-ipra comparisons would yield very similar results. In fact, they yield remarkably similar results for these and other endpoints in the review. I therefore think that it&amp;#8217;s very reasonable to combine the ipra and placebo comparison groups into a summary estimate &amp;#8211; and the heterogeneity tests strongly support that opinion. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, I agree with you that the combination of the salmeterol and placebo control groups is more of a reach and is difficult to interpret clinically. I don&amp;#8217;t think the review, in its current format, misrepresents the data or will cause people to think that tio is better than salm. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I appreciate the reasons for your suggestion to remove all current, combined summary estimates. However, if we do that we will also remove the finding of a possible effect on slowing the decline in FEV1, which you call &amp;#8220;very important&amp;#8221; and suggest that we discuss further. I actually think that removing this combined (tio-placebo and tio-ipra) estimate would misrepresent the data more than leaving it in. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Personally, I think the review is clear, concise and interpretable in its current form with a few summary estimates. I understand that you disagree, but I think that the solution of stripping the review of all summary estimates is not a good one. Possible alternatives might be to include summary estimates for tio-plac + tio-ipra only, or to report summary estimates for selected endpoints. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Please let me know what you think. Many thanks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Best regards, --Graham&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;PP Comments Aug 04: &lt;br&gt;1. Apart from occasional typos and some minor edits/suggestions which I have done as I go though (red text), the major issue remains the inclusion of the summary comparison . I have consulted with Chris Cates also. We both agree that as it is uninterpretable clinically it should not be there. The estimate of effect is pretty much exactly the same as for tio vs placebo so it doesn't make tio look any better, and there is a danger that it might be read as tio is better than all other comparators combined, when this is clearly not true from the comparisons with the agents separately.&lt;br&gt;We would like these taken out, along with the text associated with it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Methods:- clarification need for :&lt;br&gt;Control: concurrent treatments (ipratropium, short and long-acting &amp;#223;2-agonists, theophylline, inhaled and systemic corticosteroids)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;?have two lines run together perhaps?&lt;br&gt;Suggest :&lt;br&gt;comparisons (placebo, LABA , ipra) &lt;br&gt;concurrent treatments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. What was the kappa for agreement between reviewers? You said the review would not proceed unless it was OK&lt;br&gt;4. In the results section you use labels such as Table 1:1,- suggest use terminology such as Analysis 01.01, or Comparison 01.01 etc throughout to assist navigation. Tables are for other purposes e.g. included studies. The use of comparisons as outcomes is something I have not seen before and takes a bit of getting used to. &amp;quot;Comparison&amp;quot; usually refers to the treatment vs control. If the summary analyses are taken out it will be clearer I think. Might the Comparison in Analysis 01 01 say tiotropium vs other comparators?&lt;br&gt; 5. (Anthonisns 2002)- in discussion needs a reference and a link&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;6. In discusion more could be made of the clinical significance of the effects seen with tiotropium such as size of reduction in the exacerbation rate, effect on QoL and possible effect on slowing the decline in FEV1,all of which are very important. Might compare with effects seen with pulmonary rehab, inhaled steroids. I am happy to assist with this section if you like. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Exported from Review Manager 4.2&lt;br&gt;PJP 24 July 2000&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Graham, overall this looks really good. Thanks for making it easy for me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few comments/questions/suggestions&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There could be a case for doing 2 separate reviews here-vs placebo, vs ipra (depending on how many studies you find).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;--Agree, depending on the number of studies. So far the number is fairly limited, so I would prefer to keep it as one review. We could change that to two as more studies appear&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Title: &lt;br&gt;make it chronic obstructive pulmonary disease for consistency&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;--Agree, changed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Study design&lt;br&gt;How are you going to handle any cross-over studies-they are problematic, and really should only look at comparisons in the first study period. This would require individual pt data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;--Individual pt data would be ideal; failing that we will attempt to adjust SE, but I need to think about this/read up on it a bit more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Are you trying to show equivalence with ipra, or superiority? If so, there is a whole literature on setting equivalence limits. Nick Adams who works with Paul Jones has more experience -he has done the steroid trials in asthma which are not yet on the Library. However, please see discussion in the review by Mash, Breekie and Jones &amp;quot;Inhaled vs oral steroids in chronic asthma&amp;quot; Cochrane Library 2000 Issue 2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;--Superiority. There are mechanistic and useability reasons why tiotropium should be superior to ipratropium. If it is not, it may be hard to justify it's higher price. Thanks for the reference, though. I will look it up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Types of interventions:&lt;br&gt;Presumably tio is likely to be given by inhaler only. ? could it be nebulised? Presumably it will be given regularly over a defined period of time. &lt;br&gt;do you want to define chronic (? &amp;gt; 1 week)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;--I believe it is delivered by inhaler only. &lt;br&gt;--We have removed the reference to &amp;quot;chronic&amp;quot; use -- it was redundant in any case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Outcome measures:&lt;br&gt;Suggest you separate health status and symptoms. They are different, both very important, and are not well correlated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;--Agree, changed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adverse effects should also be a separate outcome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;--Agree, already done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also think about what is (are) the most important or &amp;quot;primary &amp;quot; outcome(s) for this review. They are not all as important as each other. From my perspective I would suggest lung function is secondary, and health status, clinical outcomes are primary (as nothing much changes lung function decline in COPD except stoping smoking). The strength of conclusion of this review will depend on your a priori decision about these issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;--Agree, changed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods&lt;br&gt;record smoking status, and setting of the study population (country, outpatients, primary vs secondary care etc)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;--Agree, changed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Subgroup analysis if heterogeneity exists:&lt;br&gt;Other suggestions for a priori subgroups:&lt;br&gt;?duration of tio therapy &lt;br&gt;?dose of tio therapy&lt;br&gt;?delivery method (if neb/inhaled)&lt;br&gt;?study design-parallel, cross over&lt;br&gt;?smoking status&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;--Agree, changed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think you are unlikely to get information on whether subjects have predominantly CB or emphysema, and I'm not sure that it matters really in practice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;--We agree that it may be hard to look at &amp;quot;emphysema&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;chronic bronchitis&amp;quot; separately, however if these data are available they may have a large impact on clinical outcomes if the pattern seen in some of our other datasets is reproduced.&lt;/p&gt;" NOTES_MODIFIED="2012-11-21 17:37:32 +0000" NOTES_MODIFIED_BY="Emma Welsh" REVIEW_NO="#ITIO-COP" REVMAN_SUB_VERSION="5.1.7" REVMAN_VERSION="5" SPLIT_FROM="" STAGE="R" STATUS="A" TYPE="INTERVENTION" VERSION_NO="8.0">

<P>Tiotropium (Spiriva) is a bronchodilator drug that has been developed to open the airways in the lungs effectively with once daily dosing. The main aims of therapy in COPD are to reduce exacerbations and related hospitalisations, improve quality of life, and reduce the rate of decline in lung function. The evidence from the trials in the review indicates that, compared with a placebo and ipratropium, tiotropium does reduce exacerbations and related hospitalisations and improves quality of life and symptoms in people with moderately severe COPD, although the evidence with regards to decline in lung function is less clear. Tiotropium caused dry mouth. Compared with other commonly used drugs in COPD, such as long-acting beta agonists (including salmeterol), there is not enough evidence for us to draw reliable conclusions. In order to better understand the effects of this drug we need long-term studies (over several years), studies conducted in mild and severe COPD, and additional studies that measure outcomes in relation to other agents used in the treatment of this condition.</P>
</SUMMARY_BODY>
</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Tiotropium is a new anticholinergic therapy for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) that differs from ipratropium by its functional relative selectivity for muscarinic receptor subtypes and which allows once-per-day dosing. <BR/> </P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To determine the efficacy of tiotropium on clinical endpoints such exacerbations and hospitalisations, symptom scales and pulmonary function compared to placebo and other bronchodilators used for stable COPD. </P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were identified from the Cochrane Airways Review Group Specialised Register, a compilation of systematic searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE and CINAHL, and hand searching of 20 respiratory journals. Bibliographies from included studies and reviews were searched. The date of the last search was October 2004. </P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomised clinical trials comparing tiotropium with placebo, ipratropium bromide, or long-acting ß2-agonists for greater than, or equal to, one month's duration. </P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Two reviewers independently extracted data. Missing data were obtained from authors or the manufacturer of tiotropium. The data were analysed using the Cochrane Review Manager RevMan 4.2. Studies were pooled to yield weighted mean differences (WMD) or odds ratios (OR) and reported using 95% confidence intervals (CI). </P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>From 69 identified references, nine RCTs (6,584 patients) met inclusion criteria. Tiotropium reduced the odds of a COPD exacerbation (OR 0.74; 95% CI 0.66 to 0.83) and related hospitalisations (OR 0.64; 95% CI 0.51 to 0.82) compared to placebo or ipratropium. When applied to an annual baseline risk of 45% for exacerbations and 10% for hospitalisation, the number of patients needed to treat with tiotropium for one year were 14 (95% CI 11 to 22) to prevent one exacerbation and 30 (95% CI 22 to 61) to prevent one hospitalisation compared to placebo and ipratropium. Reductions in these endpoints compared to long-acting ß2-agonists were not statistically significant. Similar patterns were evident for quality-of-life and symptom scales. Increases in FEV1 and FVC from baseline were significantly larger with tiotropium than with placebo, ipratropium and long-acting ß2-agonists over 6 to 12 months. The decline in trough FEV1 from steady state was 30 ml (95% CI 7 to 53 ml) less with tiotropium than with placebo or ipratropium over one year; no data on decline in FEV1 from steady state were available for long-acting ß2-agonists. Dry mouth was increased by tiotropium. </P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>Tiotropium reduced COPD exacerbations and related hospitalisations compared to placebo and ipratropium. It also improved health-related quality-of-life and symptom scores among patients with moderate and severe disease, and may have slowed decline in FEV1. Additional long-term studies are required to evaluate its effect on mortality and change in FEV1 to clarify its role in comparison to, or in combination with, long-acting ß2-agonists and to assess its effectiveness in mild and very severe COPD. </P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
</ABSTRACT>
<BODY MODIFIED="2012-11-21 17:36:45 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Current recommendations for the therapy of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) suggest that anticholinergic drugs should play a prominent role (<LINK REF="REF-Ferguson-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ferguson 1993</LINK>). The development of safe, effective, quaternary anticholinergic compounds that have functional relative selectivity for muscarinic receptor subtypes has generated renewed interest in anticholinergic bronchodilator therapy. </P>
<P>Tiotropium has a quaternary ammonium structure related to that of ipratropium bromide. Similar to ipratropium, tiotropium binds M1, M2 and M3 muscarinic receptors. Unlike ipratropium, tiotropium has kinetic selectivity for these receptors, dissociating slowly from M1 and M3 receptors but rapidly from M2 receptors (<LINK REF="REF-Haddad-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haddad 1994</LINK>). The slow dissociation of tiotropium from M1 and M3 receptors produces a bronchodilating effect which lasts over 24 hours, allowing once-daily dosing (<LINK REF="REF-Disse-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Disse 1999</LINK>). The rapid dissociation from M2 receptors may also be advantageous since these are feedback inhibitory receptors. Blocking M2 receptors, therefore, paradoxically increases acetylcholine release whereas unblocking them decreases acetylcholine release (<LINK REF="REF-Barnes-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barnes 2000</LINK>). Tiotropium may, therefore, have clinical benefits over ipratropium, one of the current first-line therapies for stable COPD. </P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>The aim of this review is to evaluate the efficacy of tiotropium on clinical endpoints, quality-of-life and symptom scales and pulmonary function from available randomised trial data comparing tiotropium to placebo, ipratropium bromide and long-acting ß2-agonists. </P>

<DATA_SYNTHESIS MODIFIED="2008-07-03 16:53:44 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>Trials were combined using RevMan (Version 4.2) and analyses were intention-to-treat whenever possible. When follow-up data was known to be missing (e.g., for change analyses), all available data were included and the number of persons included in the trial was considered to be the number of persons who completed the trial for that particular measure. For continuous variables, a fixed-effect weighted mean difference (WMD) and 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated for each study. Studies were pooled using fixed-effect WMD and 95% CIs. For dichotomous variables, a fixed-effect odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) was calculated for individual studies. Heterogeneity was tested using the Breslow-Day test; a P value less than 0.1 was considered statistically significant. If heterogeneity was found, a random-effects model was used. Numbers needed to treat (NNT) were calculated from the pooled OR and its 95% CI applied to the risk in the placebo group using an online calculator (Visual Rx at www.nntonline.net). This calculator converts the risk in the placebo group to the corresponding odds, applies the OR to estimate the odds in the tiotropium group, converts that odds to the corresponding risk and calculates the risk difference, the inverse of which is the NNT.</P>
<P>For each outcome, trials were pooled within categories of control group (placebo, ipratropium or long-acting ß2-agonists). Results of the one study that had two control groups (placebo and salmeterol) were entered into the two corresponding categories. Heterogeneity was tested both within and across categories of control group, so defined. Since an earlier large randomised clinical trial showed that ipratropium does not reduce health outcomes or slow decline in FEV1 relative to placebo (<LINK REF="REF-Anthonisen-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anthonisen 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Anthonisen-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anthonisen 2002</LINK>), summary estimates were calculated comparing tiotropium with placebo or ipratropium for each these endpoints, as long as there was statistical homogeneity across categories of control group. This summary estimate was calculated by pooling trials across categories of placebo and ipratropium control groups; it was not specified in the original protocol.</P>

<P>Seven of the studies included in the overview were published in the peer-reviewed literature and two were published in abstract form. The characteristics of the studies are described in the Table of included studies. The protocols of all of these studies were extremely similar. All studies enrolled patients with COPD that met standardised criteria, that was moderately severe (GOLD Stage IIb, on average), and that was clinically stable. All studies enrolled patients regardless of response to bronchodilators but excluded patients with a prior history of asthma, atopy, allergic rhinitis and elevated eosinophil count.</P>
<P>Of the nine included studies, seven compared tiotropium to placebo, one compared tiotropium to ipratropium, and one compared tiotropium to placebo and to salmeterol. All studies prohibited the use of ipratropium and allowed the use of short-acting ß2-agonists and inhaled corticosteroids as co-therapies in the intervention group. Eight of nine studies prohibited the use of long-acting ß2-agonists (the exception being <LINK REF="STD-Niewoehner-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Niewoehner 2005</LINK> where long-acting ß2-agonists were permitted). Thirty-nine to 60% of randomised patients were taking ipratropium at enrolment. Of permitted co-therapies, 66 to 99% of patients were taking ß2-agonists at enrolment and 42 to 80% were taking inhaled corticosteroids.

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Clinical outcomes</HEADING>
<P>We extracted and analysed results for cumulative incidence of COPD exacerbations, related hospitalisations, and all-cause mortality over the duration of the trials, which ranged from one to twelve months (weighted mean duration 6.3 months).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Exacerbations</HEADING>
<P>The overall cumulative incidence of COPD exacerbations was 32% in the control groups (those not receiving tiotropium) over the duration of the trials. Tiotropium reduced the primary endpoint of COPD exacerbations compared to placebo (OR 0.75; 95% CI 0.66 to 0.85) and compared to ipratropium (OR 0.64; 95% CI 0.44 to 0.92). The cumulative incidence of exacerbations was lower in the tiotropium group than the salmeterol group but the difference was somewhat smaller and not statistically significant (OR 0.88; 95% CI 0.65 to 1.17). The treatment effect of tiotropium was statistically homogeneous across the control groups (P value 0.85) and the summary OR for tiotropium compared to placebo or ipratropium was 0.74 (95% CI 0.66 to 0.83), <LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>.</P>
<P>This summary OR was applied to a risk of exacerbation of 45% over one year (the weighted average of the risk in the placebo and ipratropium arms of two trials of 12 months duration (<LINK REF="STD-Casaburi-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Casaburi 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vincken-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Vincken 2002</LINK>) to yield a NNT for tiotropium over 12 months of 14 (95% CI: 11 to 22; <LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Hospitalisations</HEADING>
<P>The overall cumulative incidence of exacerbation-related hospitalisations was 8% in the control groups over the duration of the trials. As shown in Detail 1:3, tiotropium reduced the proportion hospitalised for COPD exacerbations compared to placebo (OR 0.65; 95% CI 0.50 to 0.85). Similar reductions in hospitalisations were observed for tiotropium compared to ipratropium (OR 0.59; 95% CI 0.32 to 1.09) and compared to salmeterol (OR 0.59; 95% CI 0.29 to 1.23) but neither of these estimates were statistically significant, which may be due the smaller sample sizes. The treatment effect of tiotropium was statistically homogeneous across the control groups (P value 0.83) and the summary estimate for tiotropium compared to placebo or ipratropium was OR 0.64 (95% CI 0.51 to 0.82), <LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK>. When this OR was applied to a one year risk of hospitalisation of 10% in the two 12 month trials (<LINK REF="STD-Casaburi-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Casaburi 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vincken-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Vincken 2002</LINK>), the NNT for tiotropium was 30 (95% CI 22 to 61; <LINK REF="FIG-04" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 4</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">All-cause mortality</HEADING>
<P>Cumulative all-cause mortality was 1.5% in the control groups over the duration of the trials. There were no statistically significant differences between tiotropium and placebo, ipratropium, or salmeterol (Detail 1:5). The trials were statistically homogeneous across the control groups (P value 0.22) and the summary estimate for tiotropium compared to other treatments was not significant; with a wide confidence interval due to small numbers (OR 0.73; 95% CI 0.35 to 1.49), <LINK REF="FIG-05" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 5</LINK>.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Health-related quality of life and symptom scales</HEADING>
<P>We extracted and analysed the mean change in health-related quality of life, measured by the St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ), and the proportion with a clinically significant improvement in the SGRQ and Transitional Dyspnea Index (TDI) over the duration of the trials. We were not able to obtain adequate reports of mean change in TDI to allow its combination.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">St George's Respiratory Questionnaire</HEADING>
<P>As shown in Detail 2:1, the mean change in SGRQ over the course of the trials was larger with tiotropium than with placebo (WMD -3.3; 95% CI -4.6 to -0.8) and ipratropium (WMD -3.3; 95% CI -5.6 to -1.0). A smaller and non-significant difference was observed compared to salmeterol (WMD -1.4; 95% CI -3.2 to 0.4). The trials were statistically homogeneous across the control groups (P value 0.31) and the summary estimate for tiotropium compared to placebo or ipratropium was an improvement of WMD -3.3 (95% CI -4.7 to -2.2).<BR/>The results for the proportion with a clinically significant change in SGRQ were similar to results for mean change in SGRQ. Statistically significant differences were observed for tiotropium compared to placebo and compared to ipratropium but not for tiotropium compared to salmeterol (Detail 2:3). There was evidence of statistical heterogeneity across the control groups (P value 0.03).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Transitional Dyspnea Index</HEADING>
<P>As shown in Detail 2:4, the proportion with a clinically significant change in TDI over the course of the trials was greater with tiotropium than with placebo (OR 1.96; 95% CI 1.58 to 2.44) and ipratropium (OR 2.01; 95% CI 1.26 to 3.20) but was not significantly different from salmeterol (OR 1.08; 95% CI 0.80 to 1.46). There was evidence of statistical heterogeneity across the control groups (P value 0.07).</P>
</SUBSECTION>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Spirometric indices</HEADING>
<P>We extracted and analysed change in spirometric indices from baseline (prior to first drug dose) to the end of the trials, and change in spirometric indices from steady state (8 to 15 days after first drug dose) to the end of the trials for all available data.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Change in spirometric indices from baseline</HEADING>
<P>As shown in Detail 3:1, the mean change in trough FEV1 from baseline was greater with tiotropium than with placebo (WMD 140 ml; 95% CI 118 to 162 ml) and ipratropium (WMD 150 ml; 95% CI 106 to 193 ml). A smaller but statistically significant difference was observed compared to salmeterol (WMD 40 ml; 95% CI 12 to 68 ml). There was evidence of statistical heterogeneity across the control groups (P value less than 0.0001), which arose from the smaller mean difference when tiotropium was compared to salmeterol. Similar results were observed for change in mean FEV1 and change in peak FEV1 (Details 3:2 and 3:3).</P>
<P>As shown in Detail 3:4, the mean change in trough FVC from baseline was greater with tiotropium than with placebo (WMD 278 ml; 95% CI 208 to 348) and ipratropium (WMD 210 ml; 95% CI 112 to 308 ml). A smaller but statistically significant difference was observed compared to salmeterol (WMD 90 ml; 95% CI 35 to 145 ml). There was evidence of statistical heterogeneity across the control groups (P value less than 0.0001). Similar results were observed for change in mean FEV1 and change in peak FVC except that the difference between tiotropium and ipratropium did not attain statistical significance (Details 3:5 and 3:6).</P>
<P>As shown in Detail 3:7, the mean change in morning peak flow from baseline was greater with tiotropium than with placebo (WMD 21 ml; 95% CI 15 to 28 ml) and ipratropium (WMD 16 ml; 95% CI 7 to 25 ml). No difference was observed compared to salmeterol (WMD 0 ml; 95% CI -8 to 9 ml). There was evidence of statistical heterogeneity across the control groups (P value 0.005). Similar results were observed for change in evening peak flow except that the difference between tiotropium and salmeterol was statistically significant (Detail 3:8).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Change in spirometric indices from steady state</HEADING>
<P>Data on decline in FEV1 and FVC from steady state to the end of the trial were available for two 12-month trials, one comparing tiotropium with placebo and the other comparing tiotropium with ipratropium. As shown in Detail 3:9, the mean decline in trough FEV1 from steady state was statistically significantly slower with tiotropium than placebo (WMD 30 ml; 95% CI 2 to 56 ml) and statistically insignificantly slower with tiotropium than ipratropium (WMD 30 ml; 95% CI -14 to 74 ml). The trials were statistically homogeneous across the control groups (Pvalue greater than 0.99) and the summary estimate showed a WMD of 30 ml (95% CI 7 to 53 ml) slower decline in FEV1 for tiotropium compared to placebo or ipratropium. Results for decline in mean FEV1 and peak FEV1 were variable and showed non-significant differences for tiotropium compared to placebo or ipratropium (Details 3:10 and 3:11).<BR/>No statistically significant differences were observed between tiotropium and either control group for decline in trough, mean and peak FVC (Details 3:12, 3:13 and 3:14).</P>

</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Adverse events</HEADING>
<P>We attempted to extract data on all available adverse events, including palpitations, dry mouth, blurred vision, urinary obstruction, constipation, and cardiovascular events. The only adverse event which was reported with sufficient consistency to allow combination was dry mouth. As shown in Detail 7:1, dry mouth was significantly increased with tiotropium compared to placebo (OR 5.4; 95% CI 3.3 to 8.8), ipratropium (OR 2.1; 95% CI, 1.05 to 4.2), and salmeterol (OR 5.1; 95% CI 2.2 to 12). The statistical homogeneity of the effect of tiotropium across the control groups was borderline (P value 0.11).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Sensitivity analyses</HEADING>
<P>We attempted to perform sensitivity analyses as specified in the methods but found that the trials were very similar with respect to disease severity, prior ipratropium use, concurrent therapies, reversibility of airflow obstruction, dose and method of delivery, and clinical description of COPD. In an attempt to characterise the effect of tiotropium on exacerbations in milder COPD, we restricted the analysis to the three trials with the highest mean baseline FEV1 (<LINK REF="STD-Beeh-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Beeh 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Donnell-2004" TYPE="STUDY">O'Donnell 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vincken-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Vincken 2002</LINK>), which produced a similar summary estimate (OR 0.66; 95% CI 0.53 to 0.83) to the overall estimate.</P>
<P>The effect of tiotropium on exacerbations in the one trial that permitted concurrent use of long-acting ß2-agonists (<LINK REF="STD-Niewoehner-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Niewoehner 2005</LINK>: OR 0.81; 95% CI 0.66 to 0.99) was statistically similar to the eight others that withheld long-acting ß2-agonists (OR 0.71; 95% CI 0.61 to 0.82). A similar pattern was evident for hospitalisations: the OR for hospitalisations was 0.72 (95% CI 0.51 to 1.00) with concurrent use of long-acting ß2-agonists permitted and 0.57 (95% CI 0.41 to 0.81) with concurrent use of long-acting ß2-agonists prohibited.</P>
<P>Analyses restricted to trials of long-term duration (six months or more) yielded either identical or highly consistent results. The above-reported results for hospitalisation, mortality, SGRQ, TDI and change in spirometric indices from steady state were all based on long-term trials. The OR for exacerbations in the long-term trials was 0.78 (95% CI 0.69 to 0.88) and results for change in spirometric indices from baseline were also similar.</P>
<P>Additional sensitivity analyses by random-effects instead of fixed-effect models generally produced identical results since in the setting of homogeneity the random-effects model reduces to a fixed-effect model.</P>
<P>Funnel plots were checked for primary endpoints. The funnel plot for exacerbations showed asymmetry and a relative absence of small studies with results that did not favour tiotropium, suggesting the possibility of some publication bias (<LINK REF="FIG-06" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 6</LINK>). Funnel plots for other outcomes showed no clear evidence of publication bias, although the ability to detect such a bias was limited by the small number of included studies.</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>This systematic review of the currently available randomised trials of tiotropium for stable COPD demonstrated that tiotropium reduced COPD exacerbations and related hospitalisations compared to placebo or ipratropium. Similar improvements were evident for quality-of-life and symptom scales. Increases in FEV1 and FVC from baseline were significantly larger with tiotropium than with placebo, ipratropium and long-acting ß2-agonists. Although the total number of patients contributing data at one-year follow up in these trials was modest, there was a statistically significant difference in the decline in trough FEV1 from steady state with tiotropium compared to placebo or ipratropium. </P>
<P>The benefits observed with tiotropium for exacerbations and related hospitalisations were large and clinically important. COPD exacerbations were responsible for 8 million outpatient visits, 1.5 million emergency room visits, and 726,000 hospitalisations in the US in 2000 (<LINK REF="REF-Mannino-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mannino 2002</LINK>). A one-third reduction in hospitalisations could potentially yield significant reductions in morbidity and cost. Consistent with this expectation, tiotropium has been shown to be cost-effective, although not cost-saving, compared to ipratropium, in Europe (<LINK REF="REF-Oostenbrink-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oostenbrink 2004</LINK>). The magnitude of the reduction in exacerbation-related hospitalisations with tiotropium was similar in comparison to placebo and ipratropium and was similar in the large placebo-controlled trials that did, and did not, permit continuation of long-acting ß2-agonists during the trial. </P>
<P>Changes in quality of life, symptom scales and spirometric indices also appeared clinically significant. Compared to placebo and to ipratropium, the mean change in the SGRQ across all participants was close to the SGRQ's clinically significant change of 4 units, and substantially more participants on tiotropium achieved a clinically significant change in SQRQ and TDI compared to placebo and ipratropium. Improvements in spirometric indices from baseline were large and clinically significant compared to placebo and to ipratropium, and smaller but statistically significant compared to salmeterol. </P>
<P>The results of this meta-analysis were consistent with a prior overview (<LINK REF="REF-Sin-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sin 2003</LINK>) with respect to exacerbations and quality of life. They extend that review with more than twice as many patients and additional outcomes of hospitalisations, mortality, symptom scales, spirometric indices and adverse events. Most striking of these is the observation that the decline in trough FEV1 from steady state was slower with tiotropium than with placebo or ipratropium. This difference was large relative to the differences observed in a meta-analysis of inhaled corticosteroids in COPD (<LINK REF="REF-Sutherland-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sutherland 2003</LINK>). However, this observation should be interpreted with caution considering that it might also be due to: 1) incomplete attainment of steady state of tiotropium at 8 days; 2) chance, given that multiple spirometric indices were measured and that the duration of the relevant trials were only one year; and 3) bias, given that not all trial results for this index were available for inclusion in this summary estimate. Larger, longer-term trials are necessary to assess the validity of this result, which would be of major clinical relevance if replicated. </P>
<P>The trials included in this review were of good to excellent quality and used almost identical designs with regard to inclusion and exclusion criteria. The clinical characteristics of the patients recruited into the trials was, therefore, fairly homogeneous, and disease severity as measured by baseline spirometry and event rates in the control groups was also similar between trials. The clinical homogeneity of the trials resulted in statistical homogeneity for many outcome measures across the trials. Meta-analysis of these trials was, therefore, justified on clinical and statistical grounds. </P>
<P>We calculated summary estimates of the effects of tiotropium on clinical outcomes compared to placebo and ipratropium. Although on the face of it this approach may introduce some heterogeneity, we believe that it was justified on two grounds. First, heterogeneity would be introduced only if the control therapy (ipratropium) had an effect on the outcome. Ipratropium has been shown to not alter long-term decline in FEV1 (<LINK REF="REF-Anthonisen-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anthonisen 1994</LINK>), hospitalisations or survival (<LINK REF="REF-Anthonisen-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anthonisen 2002</LINK>) compared to placebo; long-acting ß2-agonists, on the other hand, have been shown to reduce exacerbations and hospitalisations compared to placebo. Second, there was very little statistical evidence of heterogeneity across trials with varying control groups. The effect of tiotropium on hospitalisations, for example, was the same for comparison groups of placebo and ipratropium. </P>
<P>Potential limitations of meta-analyses include double-counting of patients from overlapping publications, publication bias, and selection bias. A recent overview of therapies for COPD (<LINK REF="REF-Sin-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sin 2003</LINK>), which meta-analysed SGRQ and COPD exacerbation results for tiotropium, erroneously included two pairs of trials as separate trials. The consequent double-counting of patients yielded an analysis based on 3,574 patients instead of the 2,663 patients that were actually randomised in the trials cited in that review. We avoided such double-counting by discussing trial overlap with the primary authors and with the manufacturer of tiotropium. </P>
<P>We evaluated for publication bias by checking funnel plots and found evidence of publication bias for exacerbations. Given the relatively small weight of the smaller studies for this outcome (less than 5%), it is unlikely that any small unpublished studies severely biased our results. Large unpublished studies would pose a bigger threat to the pooled results. In order to attempt to minimise such publication bias, we contacted the manufacturer of tiotropium to obtain a list of the published, unpublished, and ongoing trials of tiotropium. The manufacturer was very helpful in providing additional information on completed published trials but did not provide information on completed but unpublished trials. Publication bias, therefore, remains a potential concern. Two completed trials that compared tiotropium to salmeterol were published in a combined form (<LINK REF="STD-Brusasco-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Brusasco 2003</LINK>) that showed no difference between tiotropium and salmeterol. One of these trials showed that tiotropium was superior to salmeterol for exacerbations. It was published a year earlier (<LINK REF="STD-Donohue-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Donohue 2002</LINK>) than the combined version; the other, which presumably showed that tiotropium was not superior to salmeterol for exacerbations is, as of this writing, yet to be published as a unique publication. We will continue to update this review in an attempt to minimise potential publication bias. </P>
<P>An additional possible concern with meta-analyses is selection bias, which refers to bias from non-differential selection of available trials for inclusion into the meta-analysis. To avoid selection bias a systematic and comprehensive search was conducted and two reviewers independently evaluated trials for inclusion into the meta-analysis using standardised pre-specified inclusion and exclusion criteria. </P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>Tiotropium reduced COPD exacerbations and exacerbation-related hospitalisations compared to placebo or ipratropium. It improved health-related quality-of-life and symptom scores among patients with moderate and severe disease compared to placebo and ipratropium and can be recommended for the treatment of stable COPD. There was a suggestion from this review that tiotropium may slow decline in FEV1, although this finding requires confirmation. </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Additional long-term studies are required to establish the effect of tiotropium on mortality and decline in FEV1, to evaluate its effectiveness in comparison to, and combination with, long-acting ß2-agonists, and to establish its role in mild and very severe COPD. </P>
