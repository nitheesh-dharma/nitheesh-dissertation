<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2013-07-26 13:11:43 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="Ahmed M Abou-Setta">
<P>Background</P>
<P>Male subfertility contributes to at least 50% of subfertility in couples. Around 39% of subfertile men have idiopathic subfertility (male subfertility with an unknown cause or origin). Gonadotrophins (hormones that stimulate sperm production) have been used in the treatment of men with this condition, but results have been inconsistent. We reviewed the evidence.</P>
<P>Study characteristics</P>
<P>We found six randomised controlled trials, with 456 participants. </P>
<P>Key results</P>
<P>There was a trend towards an increase in live birth and pregnancy rates during and within three months of gonadotrophin treatment. The quality of the evidence was very low. We did not find enough studies to allow final conclusions about the use of gonadotrophins in the treatment of men with idiopathic male factor subfertility. The quality of the evidence was very low. More studies on this subject are needed. The evidence is current to January 2013.</P>

<P>Male factors leading to subfertility account for at least half of all cases of subfertility worldwide. Although some causes of male subfertility are treatable, treatment of idiopathic male factor subfertility remains empirical. Researchers have used gonadotrophins to improve sperm parameters in idiopathic male factor subfertility with the ultimate goal of increasing birth and pregnancy rates, but results have been conflicting.</P>

<P>Two review authors independently selected the trials, assessed risk of bias and extracted data on live birth, pregnancy and adverse effects.

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-07-26 12:49:47 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Six RCTs with 456 participants and variable treatment and follow-up periods were included. From the limited data, the live birth rate per couple randomly assigned (27% vs 0%; Peto odds ratio (OR) 9.31, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.17 to 73.75, one study, 30 participants, very low-quality evidence) and the spontaneous pregnancy rate per couple randomly assigned (16% vs 7%; Peto OR 4.94, 95% CI 2.13 to 11.44, five studies, 412 participants, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%, moderate-quality evidence) were significantly higher in men receiving gonadotrophin treatment than in men receiving placebo or no treatment. No significant difference between groups was noted when intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) or intrauterine insemination (IUI) was performed. None of the included studies reported miscarriage rates, and adverse events data were sparse.</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2013-07-24 14:38:59 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="Ahmed M Abou-Setta">
<P>Encouraging preliminary data suggest a beneficial effect on live birth and pregnancy of gonadotrophin treatment for men with idiopathic male factor subfertility, but because the numbers of trials and participants are small, evidence is insufficient to allow final conclusions.

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2013-07-26 12:51:19 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Around 15% of couples experience delay in conceiving. Although male factors alone are responsible for at least 30% of cases of subfertility, a combination of male and female factors accounts for another 20%. Thus, it is estimated that male factors contribute to causes of subfertility in at least 50% of subfertile couples (<LINK REF="REF-Mecham-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mecham 1996</LINK>) and that around 39% of subfertile men have idiopathic subfertility (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1987</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2013-07-25 15:51:04 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Men given a diagnosis of idiopathic male factor subfertility are often treated with a variety of empirical treatments. One of the most commonly used treatments is human gonadotrophins.</P>
<P>Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) are naturally circulating gonadotrophins that play an important role in the process of spermatogenesis by maintaining the production of adequate numbers of good-quality sperm. LH affects spermatogenesis via its effect on testosterone synthesis, but the mechanism by which FSH regulates spermatogenesis is poorly understood. In animal models (adult male rhesus and bonnet monkeys), blocking of FSH receptors by active immunisation or pituitary FSH desensitisation results in suppression of spermatogenesis, a drop in sperm count, poor sperm motility and deficiency of acrosomal enzymes, leading to subfertility (<LINK REF="REF-Wickings-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wickings 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moudgal-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moudgal 1992</LINK>). Neutralisation of circulating endogenous FSH by ovine anti-FSH antibodies in human volunteers was associated with a drop in the quality and quantity of sperm cells produced (<LINK REF="REF-Moudgal-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moudgal 1997</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2013-07-24 14:46:04 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Acosta and colleagues (<LINK REF="REF-Acosta-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Acosta 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Acosta-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Acosta 1992</LINK>) reported that systemic administration of FSH to men with severe male factor subfertility improves fertilisation and pregnancy rates in in vitro fertilisation (IVF) cycles. More recently, the effect of FSH administration on sperm parameters in subfertile men has been considered in randomised controlled trials. One study reported that administration of recombinant human FSH (r-hFSH) (<I>recombinant</I> means 'produced by genetic engineering') was not associated with a change in sperm parameters in men with idiopathic subfertility (<LINK REF="STD-Kamischke-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Kamischke 1998</LINK>), although other studies of men with idiopathic oligozoospermia (unexplained low sperm count) reported an increase in sperm concentration and spermatogonia population (mother cells of sperms) on fine-needle aspiration (<LINK REF="STD-Foresta-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Foresta 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Foresta-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Foresta 2002</LINK>). Furthermore, the administration of gonadotrophins was associated with a significant increase in fertilisation rate in IVF cycles in a subgroup of men with poor sperm motility, morphology and count (oligoasthenoteratozoospermia) (<LINK REF="STD-Ben_x002d_Rafael-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Ben-Rafael 2000</LINK>). Such an increased fertilisation rate was not observed in other studies in men with severe male factor subfertility or oligoasthenoteratozoospermia undergoing intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) cycles (<LINK REF="STD-Ashkenazi-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Ashkenazi 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>Most of the research addressing this topic has focused on the effects of gonadotrophins on semen parameters such as motility, number and morphology. However, it is necessary to direct research toward patient-oriented outcomes such as pregnancy rate or live birth rate rather than toward surrogate outcomes as semen parameters. Many studies have shown improved sperm parameters after FSH therapy in male subfertility (<LINK REF="STD-Iacono-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Iacono 1996</LINK>

<LINK REF="STD-Foresta-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Foresta 2002</LINK>
, 
<LINK REF="STD-Caroppo-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Caroppo 2003</LINK>). Unfortunately, conventional semen analysis does not provide accurate information about the ability of the sperm to fertilise the ovum (<LINK REF="REF-Liu-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liu 2002</LINK>), and the use of semen quality as a surrogate outcome measure is not strongly correlated with improved pregnancy rates.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2013-07-25 15:45:44 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Therapeutic modalities that use semen quality rather than pregnancy rate as an outcome measure might prove misleading. Semen quality as a surrogate outcome measure is not strongly correlated with improved pregnancy rates. Randomised controlled trials that report pregnancy rates after administration of gonadotrophin to subfertile men have been conducted, and these findings should be used in decision making. Use of r-hFSH or purified FSH in men with idiopathic subfertility was not associated with a significant increase in pregnancy rates during intrauterine insemination (IUI) and intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) cycles in some studies (<LINK REF="STD-Ashkenazi-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Ashkenazi 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kamischke-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Kamischke 1998</LINK>), although it was associated with a significant increase in pregnancy rates in others (<LINK REF="STD-Baccetti-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Baccetti 2004</LINK>). Given these conflicting results, we decided to systematically review the evidence for gonadotrophin administration to men with idiopathic male factor subfertility.</P>

<P>The search strategy described above was used to obtain titles and, where possible, abstracts of studies potentially relevant to the review. The titles and abstracts were screened by one review author (AMA), who discarded studies that were clearly ineligible but aimed to be overly inclusive rather than risk losing relevant studies. Two review authors (AMA, HGAl) independently assessed studies for inclusion in accordance with the mentioned criteria. Disagreements were resolved by consensus or through arbitration by the third review author (AMAS). Further information was sought from the authors when papers contained insufficient information to allow a decision to be made regarding eligibility.</P>

<P>Statistical analysis was performed in accordance with the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). We used the number of events in the control and intervention groups of each study to calculate Peto odds ratios (ORs). </P>
<P>Live birth and pregnancy are considered positive consequences of treatment; therefore a higher proportion of women achieving these outcomes is considered a benefit. However, the outcome of adverse effects is a negative consequence; therefore higher numbers are considered detrimental. This needs to be taken into consideration when the summary graphs are viewed.</P>
<P>Studies varied in length of follow-up after completion of gonadotrophin therapy. Because FSH therapy has a "short-term effect" on fertility, we restricted our analysis to events that occurred spontaneously during FSH treatment and within 3 months after completion of FSH therapy, and in case of treatment of the female partner with IUI/IVF/ICSI, we restricted our analysis to the first cycle only.</P>

In addition, heterogeneity was quantified using the I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic, which describes the percentage of variability in effect estimates that is due to heterogeneity rather than sampling error (chance).

<P>Although all included trials might be statistically homogeneous, differences in clinical parameters may be considerable (clinical heterogeneity). These differences were taken into account when the pooled results were analysed and interpreted.

If trials met the inclusion criteria and provided the same intervention for male factor subfertility, we considered it appropriate to pool their results.</P>

</B>The duration of follow-up varied between studies. Couples were followed up only during the treatment period (12 weeks) in one study (<LINK REF="STD-Baccetti-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Baccetti 2004</LINK>). In another study, the follow-up period was extended by another 12 weeks after completion of therapy (<LINK REF="STD-Knuth-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Knuth 1987</LINK>). In the <LINK REF="STD-Kamischke-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Kamischke 1998</LINK> trial, participants were followed-up during the treatment period, then for another 12 weeks, during which assessment examinations were done, and then for another 3 months, during which pregnancies were recorded. In the <LINK REF="STD-Foresta-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Foresta 2005</LINK> trial, couples were followed up during treatment and for 3 months after completion of treatment; then, depending on their sperm count, participants were either allocated directly or re-randomly assigned into groups to receive either three cycles of IUI or one cycle of IVF/ICSI. One trial followed up with participants through a maximum of six IUI cycles (<LINK REF="STD-Matorras-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Matorras 1997</LINK>). In the remaining trial, the duration of follow-up was not reported (<LINK REF="STD-Paradisi-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Paradisi 2006</LINK>).</P>

Male subfertility was diagnosed in a different way in each trial: diagnostic criteria according to WHO 1987 criteria (<LINK REF="STD-Matorras-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Matorras 1997</LINK>), WHO 1992 criteria (<LINK REF="STD-Kamischke-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Kamischke 1998</LINK>) or WHO 1999 criteria (<LINK REF="STD-Baccetti-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Baccetti 2004</LINK>); sperm count between 0.1 and 10 Mil/mL (<LINK REF="STD-Knuth-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Knuth 1987</LINK>) and sperm count &lt; 10 million/mL on at least three separate occasions (<LINK REF="STD-Foresta-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Foresta 2005</LINK>); or poor semen quality in the form of moderate to severe oligoasthenozoospermia (range 1 to 15 10<SUP>6</SUP>/mL sperm concentration) (<LINK REF="STD-Paradisi-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Paradisi 2006</LINK>).

<I>Female partners</I>
</P>
<P>Female partners received no treatment in one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Knuth-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Knuth 1987</LINK>), and ICSI was performed after ovarian stimulation, follicular monitoring and aspiration in another trial (<LINK REF="STD-Baccetti-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Baccetti 2004</LINK>). The trial of <LINK REF="STD-Kamischke-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Kamischke 1998</LINK> did not state the exact numbers of participants who underwent treatment with assisted reproductive technologies (ART), although pregnancies were reported to occur, besides spontaneously, after IUI, IVF or ICSI. In the trial of <LINK REF="STD-Foresta-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Foresta 2005</LINK>, no intervention was applied with female partners in the first 6 months (3 months of therapy and 12 weeks of follow-up) of the trial; then participants were re-randomly assigned to IVF, ICSI or IUI, depending on the sperm count. The re-randomisation did not influence the data included in this review, but it invalidated the results of the last 3-month period of the study because it interfered with the first randomisation and rendered the chances of pregnancy due to the treatment studied unequal between the two groups. Moreover, ART was used for longer than 3 months after completion of FSH, which we considered the limit of attributing pregnancies to treatment in our analysis. The trial by Matorras et al. (<LINK REF="STD-Matorras-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Matorras 1997</LINK>) reported using ovarian stimulation, follicular monitoring and HCG administration before participants underwent IUI. The remaining trial did not report whether female partners received any fertility treatment or were monitored during the course of treatment of their male partners (<LINK REF="STD-Paradisi-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Paradisi 2006</LINK>).</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-07-24 23:08:48 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="Ahmed M Abou-Setta">
<P>Only one included trial, with a sample size of 30, reported live birth rate per couple; it reported a statistically significant increase in live births following the use of FSH. Five trials reported spontaneous pregnancies after gonadotrophin treatment as well as a significant difference in the overall pregnancy rate per couple, favouring gonadotrophins.</P>
<P>Use of gonadotrophins before IUI (one study) and ART (one study) did not lead to a significant increase in pregnancy rates. This could be attributed to the impact of the technology of IUI and ART in overcoming barriers to natural conception such as reduced sperm count, motility, or fertilisability (effect-modifying factor).</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2013-07-24 23:11:37 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="Ahmed M Abou-Setta">
<P>Unfortunately, the present systematic review identified only six valid RCTs that addressed the pregnancy rate after gonadotrophin therapy for idiopathic male subfertility (including 456 participants), but none of them was of adequate sample size. Besides, although pooling of different included studies showed positive outcomes in terms of spontaneous pregnancy rate after gonadotrophin administration, the collective sample size was not sufficient to achieve adequate power.</P>
<P>The included studies used different types of gonadotrophins (hCG, HMG, purified and highly purified FSH and recombinant hFSH) in different regimens and doses. Follow-up periods also varied between the studies. Some studies reported spontaneous pregnancy rates and others reported pregnancies after IUI and after ARTs. This represents an obvious clinical heterogeneity. Furthermore, we assumed that any benefit derived from FSH therapy is not expected to last longer than 3 months after completion of treatment, as spermatogenesis, the maturation of germ cells to mature spermatozoa, requires on average 72 to 75 days. Thus, we restricted our analysis to the treatment period and 3 months' follow-up and performed a stratified analysis according to whether pregnancy was achieved spontaneously, by IUI, or by ART. In view of this clinical heterogeneity, the conclusions may be less generalisable, although all trials demonstrated a treatment effect in the same direction.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2013-07-24 23:13:14 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="Ahmed M Abou-Setta">
<P>The quality of the evidence was variable. The randomisation method was not adequately described in three trials (<LINK REF="STD-Baccetti-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Baccetti 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kamischke-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Kamischke 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Knuth-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Knuth 1987</LINK>), data about allocation concealment were unclear in one study (<LINK REF="STD-Knuth-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Knuth 1987</LINK>) and follow-up periods varied. Only one study reported live birth, and the quality of the evidence for this outcome was rated as very low. Five studies reported spontaneous pregnancy: Their findings were consistent, but all suffered from at least one potential risk of bias, and the quality of the evidence for this outcome was rated as moderate.</P>

<P>Types of interventions: In the first protocol, we included only couples who were undergoing IUI/IVF/ICSI, but upon finding some studies that looked for spontaneous pregnancy and others that analysed both spontaneous pregnancies and those after ARTs, we removed this restriction.<BR/>
<BR/>Outcome measures: We included pregnancies diagnosed by pregnancy test and removed semen parameters from secondary outcomes, as this is a surrogate outcome that provides no value when compared with pregnancy rate.</P>
