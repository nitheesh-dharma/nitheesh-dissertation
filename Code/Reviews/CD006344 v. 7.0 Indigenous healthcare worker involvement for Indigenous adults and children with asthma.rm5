I think this review has suffered a wee bit from having had a study added and another removed, which is understandable, so I have tried to make it a bit clearer for readers, and I hope you find my edits and comments helpful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Can you check that you are happy with the following amendments which you will see in tracked changes:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;plain language summary&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;altered the risk of bias methodology to reflect current best practice.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;made a note of the fact that La Roche was excluded in the 'what's new'&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;added in links to the reference to Baily 2009 (culture specific review) to help readers find it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;added the refinement of the inclusion criteria and the risk of bias amendment into differences between protocol and review&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I felt that the description of the included studies could have been clearer in describing your reasons for excluding La Roche and talking about the three new trials for the culture specific review. The para might be a bit confusing to read using tracked changes as I did a lot of cut and pasting! Hope it's alright!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;RESPONSE: HAVE ACCEPTED MOST BUT CHANGED A FEW BITS, EMMA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I can see that there could be a risk of bias for blinding of the outcome assessors, but I am unsure that you can say that risk of bias is high for days missed school because the decision not to send their child to school is the parents. If the parent feels more (or less) strongly that their child should take a day off school because they are supported by someone with the same ethnic background as themselves, then this is an effect of the intervention and we could reasonably expect that this would happen if the trial was rolled out. If however the data collector knew what group the reporting parent was randomised to, this could potentially affect (bias) the results. I would therefore not judge this to be at high risk of bias (unless the data collectors were not biased)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RESPONSE: IT IS ALL RELATIVE, EMMA. I TEND TO BE MORE CONSERVATIVE/CAUTIOUS ESP WHEN THE PAPER IS FROM MY GROUP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have deleted the labels comparison 01 and outcome 01, 02 etc as I don't think they have any meaning for the reader. If you wanted to order the results section in some way, I would suggest that you reflect the primary and secondary outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RESPONSE: THANKS EMMA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I wonder whether it is worth tightening up the primary and secondary outcomes in this review. As you know, the outcomes have tended to change over time and now we are more likely to look at exacerbations requiring a trip to ED, hospital or a course of OCS - this is even earmarked for inclusion in our CAG policy document (thoughts?). I don't think that we would recommend that review teams submitting their reviews now include other outcomes reported by the trialists that were not specified a priori. I suppose this doesn't really matter if there are not going to be any more studies, but it might be better to make changes now if you think that there will be more studies. I would want to see days off school included if I was a parent. I think this point is especially important is particularly relevant given the call for better outcome reporting in future studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Effects of interventions&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- I turned off the pooling in the analyses as there is only a single trial. I left in the treatment effect estimates in the text for the time being. is this OK? YES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- is influenced the right word to use in this sentence? Is it not a bias?: The intervention group had more severe asthma at baseline (&lt;a link_type=&quot;STUDY&quot; protected=&quot;true&quot; href=&quot;Valery 2010&quot;&gt;Valery 2010&lt;/a&gt;), which could have influenced the results. CHOICE OF WORDS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- what scale was used in the asthma quality of life questionnaire? QOL IS AN ARBITARY SCALE FROM 1-7 AND ITS PRETTY STD&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You comment that the trial was particularly limited for the primary outcome. Why is the sample size particularly too small for the primary outcome? I would have thought a study this size was better powered for exacerbations than quality of life? Chris says he doesn't have a problem with this, but I would appreciate it if you had a moment to explain this to me, for my learning! WE DID PLAN FOR SUFFICIENT NUMBERS BUT AS PER MOST STUDIES POWER CALC WAS BASED ON ASSUMPTIONS. POST STUDY, POWER CALC SHOWED THAT IT WAS GROSSLY UNDERPOWERED (30%) FOR PRIMARY OUTCOME.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- I am not sure that indigenous needs to be capitalised, but if you feel it should it should be, please be consistent throughout the review. YES EMMA IN, AUST IT IS ALWAYS CAPTITALISED WHEN REFERRING TO THEM AS AN ETHINIC GROUP OF PEOPLE. WHEN USED AS A NOUN i HAVE LEFT IT UNCAPITALISED.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;------------------------------------------------&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;March 29th. Thanks for the responses to Peer review. This is ready for copy editing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chris&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jan 16th ready for Peer review. I have just clarified that it was random effect SMD for the parents asthma knowledge and added the fixed effects as a sensitivity analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chris&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CJC edit Jan 14th 2010&lt;br&gt;Thanks very much for updating this review.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Results&lt;br&gt;See changes in green to include SMD and heterogeneity with random model.&lt;br&gt;Metaview Labels&lt;br&gt;I have turned off the totals and reversed the graph labels for outcome 2. Also renamed outcome 3 as negative sign is confusing for reduction! Also skill score changed to SMD as scales not the same?&lt;br&gt;Were the scales the same for asthma knowledge or does this also need to be SMD. Please check you are happy with revisions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks for putting in the RoB and SoF tables. I have activated the Figure to show ROB results as Figure 1. It might be better to uncheck one of the boxes in GradePro for Medium risk as the two lines are so similar as not to add anything?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Back to authors please for checking changes and further response.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chris&lt;br&gt;+++++++++++++++++++++++++&lt;br&gt;Editing by CJC June 22&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Authors' Contribution: fine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Objectives: fine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;References: fine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Table of included studies: fine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Metaview Labels: changed to reflect the direction of outcomes. Please check these are correct!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Synopsis: fine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abstract: see slight changes in red&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: fine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: see slight changes in red. No weighting or standardised with one study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Discussion: see slight changes in red.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Contentious issues:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spellchecked: done&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next action: Back to authors to check changes please.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br&gt;I) The metrics for the continuous outcomes are set as SMD - in the methods section of the review you have stated that you would pool data with WMDs rather than SMDs. For scales such as knowledge I can see how an SMD would have been appropriate had there have been other trials in the review, but in the case of one trial contributing data on emergency department visits would not a WMD be better? In some respects this comment is not that important since there are no other studies, so the central assumption of a SMDs (i.e. that the SD represent similar distribution on the different scales) cannot be tested. However, you have quoted the SMDs in the text, so for the sake of consistency with your methods section, it would seem better to report ED visits in terms of the mean difference, rather than the difference between means as the number of SDs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ii) Just a cautionary note regarding the conclusion: '... it is arguably justifiable that IHW should be included in asthma education programs for indigenous children and adults with asthma given the complexity of health outcomes and culture.' I think the main issue here is that (purely) on the basis of what you have presented in the review (i.e. one small trial) this does not stand up and would require some qualification (possibly in the discussion section?). I am not saying that you are wrong to come this conclusion, it's just that you need to give a sense of why provision of care in this way is important, since the data from the one RCT are limited. You imply in the background section that benefits need to be weighed against cost, but as it turns out the review does not find evidence of benefit on a large scale. That said I would agree that provision of IHW to provide specific education of the importance of controlling asthma in indigenous communities makes intuitive sense - the issue is how to convey this (and therefore not give everyone the impression that you have arrived at too strong a conclusion). It could be a simple question of fleshing out the interpretation a bit more, and possibly giving the research community grounds to fund work in this area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We encountered a similar issue with a review of CPAP in sleep apnoea many years ago. Low number of trials showing small, imprecise effects, but the review ran contrary to what everyone thought, because they all felt that CPAP should be given because they saw it work. Sometimes it is the interventions that appear the most effective that require the most amount of understanding. We now know much more about adherence/perception of benefit and the need for ongoing reinforcement (and possible pressure titration and modification) in managing OSA because of the way that the Sleep research community responded to the initial call for research. On the back of these studies, we also know what the priority areas of research are. You make the case in the Background that since many studies have been performed on education in (presumably) non-indigenous communities, that IHW should also be assessed in this way. My view of any intervention is that if it is given to patients, then it merits assessment, and that recommending provision on the basis of low numbers of trials is problematic. There is no reason why IHW interventions are any less deserving of significant research than any other educational intervention, and that may be the most important message to come from the review.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;===================================================&lt;br&gt;CJC edit Nov 13&lt;br&gt;This looks fine. I would advise caution about how you use the quality assessment in terms of number of items that are of high quality. You may wish to specify what you would regard as the main potential areas of threat to validity for this review; but I would not say any three items versus two or less as this is using the domains as a scale again like Jadad. No-one really knows what is best in this area however! Allocation concealment and blinding have the best empirical evidence for altering the results. I have suggested using this for now. Is this ok?&lt;br&gt;Toby will submit tomorrow if you are happy with this.&lt;br&gt;===================================================&lt;br&gt;Thanks for this protocol Anne.&lt;br&gt;I have removed the Jadad scale as we are moving away from scales for quality assessment. Your existing quality assessment is fine. There is work ongoing to introduce measures of bias protection in RCTs including : Sequence generation, Allocation concealment, blinding, drop-outs, selective reporting and other threats.&lt;br&gt;I have also removed the final sensitivity analysis as cross-over design is not suitable for the trials in this protocol, and I do not think you need sensitivity in relation to different medication used for this protocol.&lt;br&gt;Out of interest how do you plan to use your quality assessment in sensitivity analysis. The cut point ideally should be predefined if you plan to use the quality assessment dichotomously. (I do not have a neat answer to this one)!&lt;/p&gt;" NOTES_MODIFIED="2011-06-13 15:31:24 +0100" NOTES_MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh" REVIEW_NO="IND-AST" REVMAN_SUB_VERSION="5.1.1" REVMAN_VERSION="5" SPLIT_FROM="" STAGE="R" STATUS="A" TYPE="INTERVENTION" VERSION_NO="7.0">

<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2011-06-07 16:06:28 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">
<P>World-wide indigenous people with asthma are disproportionately represented in the severe end of the disease spectrum. Appropriate models of care are important in the successful delivery of services, and are likely contributors to improved outcomes for people with asthma. In this review, we examined if involvement of an indigenous healthcare worker (IHW) (when compared to absence of an IHW) in asthma education programs improves asthma related outcomes in Indigenous children and adults with asthma. There was only one study involving 113 people eligible for inclusion in this review. The participants showed improvement in the patient's asthma knowledge score, the parent's asthma skill score and a reduction in the number of days missed from school in children who were cared for by an indigenous healthcare worker. However as exacerbation frequency was not reduced and there was only a single, small study, we cannot be confident of the results although we think it is likely that the involvement of IHW is beneficial. Nevertheless, given the complexity of health outcomes and culture as well as the importance of self-determination for indigenous peoples, the practice of including IHW in asthma education programs for indigenous children and adults with asthma is justified, but should be subject to further randomised controlled trials</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2010-03-25 05:15:59 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anne B Chang">
<P>Asthma education is regarded as an important step in the management of asthma in national guidelines. Racial, ethnicity and socio-economic factors are associated with markers of asthma severity, including recurrent acute presentations to emergency health facilities. Worldwide, indigenous groups are disproportionately represented in the severe end of the asthma spectrum. Appropriate models of care are important in the successful delivery of services, and are likely contributors to improved outcomes for people with asthma.</P>

<P>One study fulfilled inclusion criteria involving 113 children randomised to an asthma education programme involving an IHW, compared to a similar education programme without an IHW. Eighty eight of these children completed the trial. Parents' asthma knowledge score (mean difference (MD) (7.49; 95% CI 5.52 to 9.46), parents' asthma skill score (MD 0.98; 95% CI 0.52 to 1.44) and days absent from school (100% school-aged children in the intervention group missed &lt;7 days, 21% of controls missed 7-14 days, difference = 21%, 95% CI 5-36%) were significantly better in the intervention group compared to controls. There was no significant difference in mean number of exacerbations (per year) between groups. There was no difference in quality of life or children's asthma skill score; both were limited to one study only and the direction favoured IHW group. There were no studies in adults.</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2011-06-05 14:30:09 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The involvement of IHW in asthma programs targeted for their own ethnic group in one small trial was beneficial in improving most, but not all asthma outcomes in children with asthma. It is very likely that involvement of an IHW is beneficial. However as exacerbation frequency was not significantly different between groups, we cannot be confident of the results in all settings. Nevertheless, given the complexity of health outcomes and culture as well as the importance of self-determination for indigenous peoples, the practice of including IHW in asthma education programs for indigenous children and adults with asthma is justified, but should be subject to further randomised controlled trials.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2011-06-07 16:06:59 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">
<P>Asthma education for people with asthma is regarded as an important step in the management of asthma in national asthma guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-BTS-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">BTS 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Coughlan-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Coughlan 2000</LINK>). Asthma education, defined as the provision of disease related and management information on asthma, encompasses various formats that includes face-to-face encounters, group sessions, outreach and home visits, provision of asthma action plans, education of recognition of loss of asthma control and self management skills (<LINK REF="REF-BTS-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">BTS 2005</LINK>). Most of these are addressed (or are being addressed) in other Cochrane reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Bailey-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bailey 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gibson-2002a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gibson 2002a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gibson-2002b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gibson 2002b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Powell-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Powell 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wolf-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wolf 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Toelle-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Toelle 2004</LINK>) from the Cochrane Airways Group.</P>
<P>Racial and socio-economic factors are associated with asthma severity and recurrent acute presentations to emergency health facilities (<LINK REF="REF-de-Oliveira-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">de Oliveira 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sin-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sin 2002</LINK>). The reasons for this are unclear; contributing factors are arguably likely to include broad service delivery issues rather than a reflection of intrinsic asthma severity (<LINK REF="REF-Chang-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chang 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Enarson-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Enarson 1999</LINK>). Other cultural influences on the management of asthma include symptom perception and understanding of disease and self management (<LINK REF="REF-Enarson-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Enarson 1999</LINK>). Appropriate models of care are important in the successful delivery of healthcare services, and contribute to improved care of people with asthma (<LINK REF="REF-Chang-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chang 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Partridge-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Partridge 2000</LINK>). Models of care should be culture appropriate (<LINK REF="REF-Enarson-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Enarson 1999</LINK>). As outlined by Swartz and Dick, the World Health Organisation model of healthcare for chronic diseases in low-income settings recognises that "health care should facilitate an ongoing relationship between provider and patient and help patients to make full use of their own and their community's resources for health" (<LINK REF="REF-Swartz-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Swartz 2002</LINK>). Not surprisingly, in the health literature for indigenous groups, the model of care for chronic diseases in indigenous people includes the involvement of indigenous healthcare workers (IHWs) (<LINK REF="REF-Chino-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chino 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hamdorf-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hamdorf 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NHMRC-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">NHMRC 2005</LINK>). Amongst other factors, involvement of IHWs would facilitate this relationship between patient and the provider. Furthermore, involvement of IHWs could reduce the prejudices and inequities that exist in some sections of healthcare systems (<LINK REF="REF-Eades-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eades 2000</LINK>) and contribute to capacity building of the local community, a key component of the Ottawa Charter for Health Promotion (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1986</LINK>). However, while this is indisputably culturally important, the additional human resources involve a cost for the health system. This cost must be weighed against the available evidence of benefits to patients, their communities and the broader healthcare system.</P>
<P>The definition, background training and tasks performed by IHWs varies from state to state and country to country. Country specific definitions of 'indigenous' status also vary. These terms are not always universally accepted or used and in fact, remain a highly contested term (<LINK REF="REF-Nettelton-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nettelton 2007</LINK>). "In Australia, accepted terminology for indigenous peoples includes 'Australian Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples', in the USA and Canada the term 'First Nations' is used to describe the Indian, Métis, and Inuit populations" (<LINK REF="REF-Cunningham-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cunningham 2003</LINK>). "In Hawaii, native Hawaiian finds favour" and "the Maori of New Zealand use 'Tangata Whenua' or 'people of the land' in preference to Maori" (<LINK REF="REF-Cunningham-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cunningham 2003</LINK>). Although cognisant of the various preferences by different groups, an encompassing term is required for this review. We have chosen the term 'indigenous' which is defined in recognition of "the experiences shared by a group of people who have inhabited a country for thousands of years, which often contrast with those of other groups of people who reside in the same country for a few hundred years" (<LINK REF="REF-Cunningham-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cunningham 2003</LINK>).<BR/>
<BR/>Outcomes of asthma education programs can be variably defined. Arguably the most important asthma education outcome is the provision of self management so as to prevent death and morbidity from acute exacerbations. Other outcomes are reduction of day to day morbidity from asthma-related symptoms and objective measurements of asthma severity (<LINK REF="REF-BTS-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">BTS 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>A systematic review to determine whether involvement of an indigenous healthcare worker (IHW) improves asthma related outcomes in Indigenous children and adults with asthma will be useful to guide clinical practice and health policy.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2011-06-05 14:30:10 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We identified one randomised controlled trial comparing IHW with no IHW involvement for asthma education program in children. There was no difference in exacerbations between groups. However in all other outcomes, the group with IHW involvement in the asthma education program either had significantly better outcomes or the direction of effect was in favour of the IHW group compared to the control group.</P>
<P>Our findings are consistent with data from several papers (<LINK REF="STD-Fisher-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Fisher 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Flores-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Flores 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Krieger-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Krieger 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-La-Roche-2006" TYPE="STUDY">La Roche 2006</LINK>) that have largely shown the beneficial effects of health or community workers involvement in minor ethnic groups with poorer asthma outcomes. In this updated review we restricted our group to Indigenous groups (given the rather unique issues faced by Indigenous groups) and did not include ethnic minority groups (i.e. people originating from a country other than the country in which the trial was conducted) in this review and arguably should be addressed in a different review.</P>
<P>This review is considerably limited by the very small sample size and the presence of only a single study with most outcomes unblinded. Particularly for the primary outcome (exacerbations), the sample size is likely far too small. There were no data relevant to adults.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2011-06-05 14:30:10 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The involvement of IHW in asthma programs targeted for their own ethnic group was beneficial in most asthma outcomes but not for asthma exacerbations. Thus there is insufficient data to be absolutely confident that the involvement of IHW is beneficial in all settings where asthma programs are delivered to Indigenous people (i.e. the vast heterogeneity in Indigenous cultures and health services provided to Indigenous people worldwide). Nevertheless, given the complexity of health outcomes and culture as well as the importance of self-determination for Indigenous peoples, the practice of including IHW in asthma education programs for Indigenous children and adults with asthma is justified, unless new data suggest otherwise.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Additional randomised controlled trials of IHW involvement in asthma education programs are clearly needed. Trials should be parallel studies and assessor blinded if possible. Outcome measures for asthma should include asthma exacerbation indices, patient-relevant factors (asthma control or quality of life or both) supported by objective data if possible. Inclusion of the cost effectiveness of the intervention would also be useful. </P>

<CHAR_METHODS MODIFIED="2010-01-08 12:05:16 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anne B Chang">
<P>Parellel randomised controlled trial carried out in a remote Indigenous region (Torres Straits and Northern Peninsular Area, Queensland, Australia). Eligible children were randomly allocated to one of the two treatment regimes: (1) additional asthma education intervention with children and their parents; (2) no additional education (children received the usual information about asthma at the consultation).  Culturally appropriate paediatric asthma education materials were used during education sessions with parents and children; trained IHWs carried out the asthma education session.</P>
<P>Information was collected through face-to-face interviews using standardized data collection forms. Outcomes collected at baseline and at 12 months (last visit) when all children had another clinical consultation and outcome measures re-collected.</P>
</CHAR_METHODS>
<CHAR_PARTICIPANTS MODIFIED="2010-01-08 14:14:26 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anne B Chang">
<P>113 of 117 (97%) eligible children (1-17 years) were enrolled. 88 (81%, 35 in 'IHW additional education&#8217; arm, 53 controls) with complete follow up were included in analysis.</P>
<P>Intervention arm: mean age 7.5, SD 4.4; 26 boys, 9 girls</P>
<P>Control arm: mean age 6.6, SD 3.8; 35 boys, 18 girls.</P>
<P>Baseline group similar in parental education, smoke exposure, baseline knowledge of asthma, QOL, FEV1. However the intervention group had a non-significant higher degree of asthma severity.</P>
</CHAR_PARTICIPANTS>
<CHAR_INTERVENTIONS MODIFIED="2010-01-16 00:09:03 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anne B Chang">
<P>During the baseline visit all children received education about their asthma and the respiratory specialists, as well as the health workers, were involved in the consultation. They were shown how to use the Asthma Action Plan, and were given the asthma education booklets specifically prepared for the Torres Strait Islander children. Children selected to receive the intervention (additional asthma education) also received a personalised, child-friendly booklet (age specific booklets for 3-6 year olds, 7-10 year olds and over 10 year-olds) that were used during the consultation. The booklet contained personalised child data such as spirometry, Asthma Action Plan, and growth chart. In addition, children in the intervention group had three visits from the health worker for their asthma (about 1 month, 3 months and 6 months after the clinical consultation). During these visits, health workers used the same resources to reinforce asthma education and wrote the details down in the personalised child booklet.  In each visit, the IHW also collected information on secondary outcome measures (i.e. quality of life questions) using a standardised data collection form. Adherence to protocol by the IHW was monitored by checking these forms.</P>
<P>The control group (no additional education) did not receive a personalised child-friendly booklet and were not visited by the health worker.</P>
<P>All children (i.e. both arms) received routine education in the clinic structure.</P>
</CHAR_INTERVENTIONS>
<CHAR_OUTCOMES MODIFIED="2010-01-08 11:57:46 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anne B Chang">
<P>Primary outcome was the number of unscheduled hospital/doctor visits due to asthma exacerbation. Secondary outcomes included: functional severity score, assessment of basic knowledge of medications and the delivery technique (if on regular medication), measurement of quality of life, Asthma Action Plan (readily available, can parent interpret?) and number of school days missed due to asthma.</P>
