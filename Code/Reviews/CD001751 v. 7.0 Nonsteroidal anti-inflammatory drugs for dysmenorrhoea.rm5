<P>
<B>Review question</B>
</P>
<P>Are nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) safe and effective for relief of period pain (dysmenorrhoea) and how do they compare with each other and with paracetamol?</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>Nearly three-quarters of women suffer from period pain or menstrual cramps (dysmenorrhoea). Research has shown that women with severe period pain have high levels of prostaglandins, hormones known to cause cramping abdominal pain. NSAIDs are drugs which act by blocking prostaglandin production. NSAIDs include the common painkillers aspirin, naproxen, ibuprofen and mefenamic acid. Researchers in The Cochrane Collaboration reviewed the evidence about the safety and effectiveness of NSAIDs for period pain. The evidence is current to January 2015.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>We found 80 randomised controlled trials (RCTs), which included a total of 5820 women and compared 20 different types of NSAIDs with placebo (an inactive pill), paracetamol or each other. Most of the studies were commercially funded (59%), and a further 31% did not state their source of funding.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>The review found that NSAIDs appear to be very effective in relieving period pain. The evidence suggests that if 18% of women taking placebo achieve moderate or excellent pain relief, between 45% and 53% taking NSAIDs will do so. NSAIDs appear to work better than paracetamol, but it is unclear whether any one NSAID is safer or more effective than others.</P>
<P>NSAIDs commonly cause adverse effects (side effects), including indigestion, headaches and drowsiness. The evidence suggests that if 10% of women taking placebo experience side effects, between 11% and 14% of women taking NSAIDs will do so.</P>
<P>Based on two studies that made head-to-head comparisons, there was no evidence that newer types of NSAID (known as COX-2-specific inhibitors) are more effective for the treatment of dysmenorrhoea than traditional NSAIDs (known as non-selective inhibitors), nor that there is a difference between them with regard to adverse effects.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
</P>
<P>We rated the quality of the evidence as low for most comparisons, mainly due to poor reporting of study methods.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2015-07-15 01:50:05 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Dysmenorrhoea is a common gynaecological problem consisting of painful cramps accompanying menstruation, which in the absence of any underlying abnormality is known as primary dysmenorrhoea. Research has shown that women with dysmenorrhoea have high levels of prostaglandins, hormones known to cause cramping abdominal pain. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are drugs that act by blocking prostaglandin production. They inhibit the action of cyclooxygenase (COX), an enzyme responsible for the formation of prostaglandins. The COX enzyme exists in two forms, COX-1 and COX-2. Traditional NSAIDs are considered 'non-selective' because they inhibit both COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes. More selective NSAIDs that solely target COX-2 enzymes (COX-2-specific inhibitors) were launched in 1999 with the aim of reducing side effects commonly reported in association with NSAIDs, such as indigestion, headaches and drowsiness.</P>

<P>We searched the following databases in January 2015: Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group Specialised Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, November 2014 issue), MEDLINE, EMBASE and Web of Science.

<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2015-07-15 01:50:05 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two review authors independently selected the studies, assessed their risk of bias and extracted data, calculating odds ratios (ORs) for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences for continuous outcomes, with 95% confidence intervals (CIs).

</P>
<P>Among women with primary dysmenorrhoea, NSAIDs were more effective for pain relief than placebo (OR 4.37, 95% CI 3.76 to 5.09; 35 RCTs, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 53%, low quality evidence). This suggests that if 18% of women taking placebo achieve moderate or excellent pain relief, between 45% and 53% taking NSAIDs will do so.</P>
<P>However, NSAIDs were associated with more adverse effects (overall adverse effects: OR 1.29, 95% CI 1.11 to 1.51, 25 RCTs, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%, low quality evidence; gastrointestinal adverse effects: OR 1.58, 95% CI 1.12 to 2.23, 14 RCTs, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 30%; neurological adverse effects: OR 2.74, 95% CI 1.66 to 4.53, seven RCTs, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%, low quality evidence).

<P>When NSAIDs were compared with each other there was little evidence of the superiority of any individual NSAID for either pain relief or safety. However, the available evidence had little power to detect such differences, as most individual comparisons were based on very few small trials.</P>

<P>Only two of the included studies utilised COX-2-specific inhibitors (etoricoxib and celecoxib). There was no evidence that COX-2-specific inhibitors were more effective or tolerable for the treatment of dysmenorrhoea than traditional NSAIDs; however data were very scanty.</P>

<B>NSAIDs versus paracetamol</B>
</P>
<P>NSAIDs appeared to be more effective for pain relief than paracetamol (OR 1.89, 95% CI 1.05 to 3.43, three RCTs, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%, low quality evidence). There was no evidence of a difference with regard to adverse effects, though data were very scanty.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2015-07-15 01:50:05 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Dysmenorrhoea refers to the occurrence of painful menstrual cramps of uterine origin, usually developing within hours of the start of menstruation and peaking as the flow becomes heaviest during the first day or two of the cycle. Pain is usually centred in the suprapubic area but may radiate to the back of the legs or lower back, and may be accompanied by other symptoms such as nausea, diarrhoea, headache and lightheadedness (<LINK REF="REF-Coco-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Coco 1999</LINK>). Dysmenorrhoea is a common gynaecological complaint, though prevalence estimates vary widely. It was reported by 72% of Australian women of reproductive age in a recent nationally representative sample (<LINK REF="REF-Pitts-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pitts 2008</LINK>), and caused severe pain in 15% of cases. Other representative samples report rates ranging from 17% to 81% (<LINK REF="REF-Latthe-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Latthe 2006</LINK>). In addition to the distress associated with dysmenorrhoea, surveys have shown significant socio-economic repercussions: over 35% of female high school students report missing school due to menstrual pain (<LINK REF="REF-Banikarim-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Banikarim 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hillen-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hillen 1999</LINK>), and 15% of working Hungarian women of reproductive age reported that painful menstruation limited daily activity (<LINK REF="REF-Laszlo-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Laszlo 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>Dysmenorrhoea is commonly defined within two subcategories. When menstrual pelvic pain is associated with an identifiable pathological condition, such as endometriosis or ovarian cysts, it is termed <I>secondary</I> dysmenorrhoea, while menstrual pain without organic pathology is termed <I>primary</I> dysmenorrhoea (<LINK REF="REF-Lichten-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lichten 1987</LINK>). The initial onset of primary dysmenorrhoea is usually with the first occurrence of menstruation (menarche), when ovulatory cycles are established, or within the following six to 12 months. The duration of pain is commonly 48 to 72 hours and accompanies menstrual flow or precedes it by only a few hours. In contrast, secondary dysmenorrhoea is more likely to occur years after the onset of menarche and pain can occur both before and during menstruation (<LINK REF="REF-Dawood-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dawood 1984</LINK>).</P>
<P>The aetiology of primary dysmenorrhoea has been the source of considerable debate. Current understanding is that it is caused by an excessive or imbalanced amount of prostanoids (hormone-like substances including prostaglandin) released from the endometrium during menstruation. These cause the uterus to contract frequently and dysrhythmically, with reduced local blood flow and hyper sensitisation of the peripheral nerves (<LINK REF="REF-Dawood-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dawood 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dawood-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Dawood 2007</LINK>). Although most women with dysmenorrhoea have higher levels of prostaglandins F2 alpha and E2 than non-dysmenorrhoeic women (<LINK REF="REF-Pickles-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pickles 1979</LINK>), some women with severe dysmenorrhoea and normal laparoscopic findings do not have elevated menstrual prostaglandin to account for the symptoms (<LINK REF="REF-Chan-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chan 1978</LINK>). The prevalence of such cases is unknown. It has been suggested that the antidiuretic hormone vasopressin may also be involved in the aetiology of primary dysmenorrhoea, but its role remains controversial (<LINK REF="REF-Dawood-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dawood 2006</LINK>).<BR/>

<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2015-07-15 01:50:05 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are non-narcotic analgesics. The first drug of this type was aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid), which was introduced in 1899. The term NSAID was first used in the 1950s when phenylbutazone was developed (<LINK REF="REF-Hart-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hart 1984</LINK>). Since then NSAIDs have proliferated and many different types are available. NSAIDs inhibit the action of cyclooxygenase (COX), an enzyme responsible for the formation of prostaglandin (and other prostanoids). The COX enzyme exists in two forms, COX-1 and COX-2. Traditional NSAIDs are considered 'non-selective' because they inhibit both COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes. The anti-inflammatory and pain-relieving effects of NSAIDs are thought to be mainly due to inhibition of COX-2 enzymes, whereas the side effects (commonly gastrointestinal) appear to be related to the inhibition of COX-1 enzymes. With the aim of improving the tolerability of NSAIDs, highly selective COX-2-specific inhibitors (coxibs) were developed and first launched in 1999. Since then there have been concerns regarding the risk of cardiovascular and/or dermatological adverse events associated with the long-term use of some coxibs, and some have been withdrawn by manufacturers. There is growing evidence that NSAIDs as a class are associated with some degree of cardiovascular risk when used long-term, as in the management of chronic pain in the elderly (<LINK REF="REF-Shi-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shi 2008</LINK>).</P>

<THEORY MODIFIED="2015-03-04 13:38:22 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>It is thought that NSAIDs relieve primary dysmenorrhoea mainly by suppressing the production of endometrial prostaglandins, thus alleviating cramps and restoring normal uterine activity. In addition there may be direct analgesic action on the central nervous system (<LINK REF="REF-Dawood-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dawood 2006</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2015-05-15 13:44:31 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is a large body of randomised controlled trials evaluating the short-term use of NSAIDs for treatment of dysmenorrhoea. A previous systematic review of NSAIDs for dysmenorrhoea considered the four most commonly used types: aspirin, ibuprofen, mefenamic acid and naproxen (<LINK REF="REF-Zhang-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhang 1998</LINK>). The purpose of the current review is to compare all nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs used in the treatment of primary dysmenorrhoea with placebo, with paracetamol and with each other to evaluate their effectiveness and safety.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Denominator</HEADING>
<P>We only included data reported 'per woman' in meta-analyses. Where studies reported data only 'per menstrual cycle' we briefly summarised results in an additional table. Where trials compared two NSAIDs against placebo, if possible we evenly divided the placebo group between the two trials to avoid double-counting in the meta-analysis. Where the placebo group contained an uneven number of women, we entered the placebo group for both comparisons and performed a sensitivity analysis to examine the effect on pooled findings.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Cross-over trials</HEADING>
<P>For the 2009 update of this review (and subsequent updates) we made an a priori decision to include data from all phases of cross-over trials, wherever possible. The strength of a cross-over design is that variation in repeated responses between women is usually less than that between different women and hence the trials can give more precise results. To exploit this correlation, cross-over trials should be analysed using a method of analysis specific to paired data. Methods are now available for meta-analysing cross-over trials and for combining the summary effect measures of parallel and cross-over trials. However, to date the reporting of cross-over trials has been very variable and the data required to include a paired analysis in a meta-analysis are frequently unreported so that there is insufficient information to apply any one synthesis method consistently (<LINK REF="REF-Elbourne-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elbourne 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>In this review, where cross-over trials were analysed using methods suitable for paired data and reported an overall measure of effect and standard error (or where this was calculable), we extracted these data and displayed them alongside data from parallel trials. Where cross-over trials reported dichotomous data or continuous data analysed using non-paired methods, we extracted these data as if they derived from parallel trials (i.e. as if they had twice as many women). This method of analysis permits the use of more of the available data but is likely to widen confidence intervals, with the possible consequence of disguising clinically important heterogeneity (differences between the studies). Nevertheless, this incorrect analysis is conservative, in that studies are under-weighted rather than over-weighted. We explored the effect of this choice of analysis in sensitivity analyses.</P>

<P>We considered whether the clinical and methodological characteristics of the included studies were sufficiently similar for meta-analysis to provide a meaningful summary. Where pooling was conducted, we examined heterogeneity between the results of different studies by inspecting the scatter in the data points and the overlap in their confidence intervals and more formally by checking the results of the Chi<SUP>2 </SUP>tests and I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic. We took a P value of less than 0.1 for the Chi<SUP>2 </SUP>test to indicate significant heterogeneity and if this was detected, we used the I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic to estimate the percentage of the variability in effect estimates due to heterogeneity rather than sampling error. We took an I<SUP>2</SUP> value greater than 50% to indicate substantial heterogeneity (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>).</P>

<BIAS_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2015-07-15 01:50:05 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In view of the difficulty in detecting and correcting for publication bias and other reporting biases, we aimed to minimise their potential impact by ensuring a comprehensive search for eligible studies and by being alert for duplication of data. We used a funnel plot to assess the possibility of small study effects (a tendency for estimates of the intervention effect to be more beneficial in smaller studies) for the primary review outcomes. We cautiously considered visible asymmetry in the funnel plot as a possible indication of publication bias.</P>

<DATA_SYNTHESIS MODIFIED="2015-07-15 01:50:05 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We synthesised (combined) the data from primary studies if they were sufficiently homogeneous. We stratified studies by the type of NSAID and comparator used.</P>
<P>For the 2009 update of the review (and subsequent updates including this one in 2015) we made an a priori decision to pool both cross-over and parallel data using the inverse variance method. We calculated mean differences (MDs) for continuous data and pooled odds ratios for dichotomous data, with 95% confidence intervals. We used both fixed-effect and random-effects statistical models. Fixed-effect models are displayed in the review where data are homogeneous. An increase in the odds of a particular outcome, which may be beneficial (for example, pain relief) or detrimental (for example, an adverse effect), is displayed graphically in the meta-analyses to the right of the centre-line and a decrease in the odds of an outcome to the left of the centre-line.</P>
<P>If it was not possible to extract from a trial report either dichotomous or continuous data suitable for the calculation of ORs or MDs then we reported statistical data in additional tables. Where trial results were presented only as graphs, we described the findings in the text.</P>
<P>We translated the key results into assumed and comparative risks expressed as a percentage. We estimated control group risks for the main comparison from median values in the placebo group in 31 studies of pain relief and 19 of adverse effects in a previous version of this review, and we estimated the corresponding intervention group risk using the formula suggested in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>; Section 11.5.5).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Participants</HEADING>
<P>The inclusion and exclusion criteria for the majority of included studies were quite explicit. All but three of the trials stated clearly either that they included only women with primary dysmenorrhoea, or that women with secondary dysmenorrhoea were excluded. The other three studies had less specific inclusion criteria that did not define dysmenorrhoea (<LINK REF="STD-Akerlund-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Akerlund 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pauls-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Pauls 1978</LINK>), or included both primary and secondary dysmenorrhoea but reported results separately (<LINK REF="STD-Sahin-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Sahin 2003</LINK>). The diagnosis of primary dysmenorrhoea was confirmed by a physical or gynaecological examination in 40 of the included studies. Oral contraceptive use was an exclusion criterion in most of the studies, and other common exclusion criteria were pelvic disease, intrauterine device (IUD) use, irregular menstrual cycles, renal or hepatic disorders, contraindications to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, pregnancy, planned pregnancy and use of hormonal preparations, analgesics or other medications that could interfere with the proposed comparisons.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Outcomes</HEADING>
<P>Outcomes measures varied. Most studies measured pain relief by asking women to keep a daily record during their menstrual period, rating their degree of pain relief on an ordinal scale, either categorical (e.g. from poor to excellent) or numerical (e.g. 1 to 5), while others used a dichotomous measure (e.g. complete relief/ongoing pain). Some women were asked to rate their pain intensity on various types of continuous numerical scale: few studies used a visual analogue scale. In most cases pain relief was reported as the proportion of women experiencing relief, though some trials instead used the number of menstrual cycles as the denominator. Interference with daily activities and absence from work/school were generally measured as the proportion of women reporting any degree of interference with their normal routine or any need for days off. About a quarter of the trials clearly reported that they measured adverse effects by prospective self report, using a questionnaire, record card or diary in which the women noted any symptoms daily during their menstrual period. Others assessed this outcome retrospectively at follow-up appointments, by either specific or non-specific questioning or simply by recording information volunteered by the participant. Many trials did not specify how they measured adverse effects.</P>

The impact of selective reporting of harms on the pooled result is not obvious, as selective emphasis of those adverse events where analyses were statistically significant might overstate those harms, and selective omission might attenuate the estimated effect (see <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>).</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">1) Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) versus placebo</HEADING>
<P>There were 47 trials comparing NSAIDs versus placebo from which data on pain relief could be extracted, which were suitable for meta-analysis. They compared the following NSAIDs versus placebo: aspirin (one study), celecoxib (two studies), diclofenac (three studies), etodolac (one study), etoricoxib (one study), fenoprofen (two studies), flufenamic acid (one study), ibuprofen (six studies), indomethacin (three studies), ketoprofen (two studies), lysine clonixinate (one study), mefenamic acid (four studies), meloxicam (one study), naproxen (21 studies), niflumic acid (one study) and nimesulide (two studies); some trials included more than one comparison. The studies analysed a total of 2602 women, 2006 women in cross-over trials and 596 women in parallel trials.</P>
<P>When we pooled dichotomous data from 35 studies comparing all NSAIDs versus placebo, NSAIDs were more effective than placebo at producing moderate or excellent pain relief (odds ratio (OR) 4.37, 95% confidence interval (CI) 3.76 to 5.09; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 53%) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>; <LINK REF="FIG-05" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 5</LINK>). Effect sizes varied, with few studies and wide confidence intervals for most comparisons. The most precise finding was for naproxen (OR 3.67, 95% CI 2.94 to 4.58; 16 studies, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 52%). The placebo groups in three studies contributed twice to the pooled analysis of all NSAIDs, but sensitivity analyses excluding these studies did not materially affect the results (<LINK REF="STD-Di-Girolamo-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Di Girolamo 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Marchini-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Marchini 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mehlisch-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Mehlisch 1990</LINK>). Heterogeneity in these analyses is discussed below.</P>
<P>Among 12 studies reporting continuous data for this outcome, only two used visual analogue scales (VAS). The other 10 studies compared seven different NSAIDs versus placebo, using five different pain scales. We combined the studies that used common scales, as an attempt to pool scales (and calculate the standardised mean difference (SMD)) resulted in high levels of heterogeneity. In most analyses NSAIDs were more effective than placebo in producing moderate/excellent pain relief and/or in reducing pain scores. The only NSAIDs without clear indication of benefit were aspirin and fenoprofen, which were tested in a single study each (<LINK REF="CMP-001.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.6</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">2) NSAIDs versus NSAIDs</HEADING>
<P>There were 18 studies comparing NSAIDs head-to-head from which data suitable for meta-analysis could be extracted, only two of which compared the same two NSAIDs (<LINK REF="STD-Daniels-2009a" TYPE="STUDY">Daniels 2009a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Daniels-2009b" TYPE="STUDY">Daniels 2009b</LINK>).

They analysed a total of 498 women, 381 in cross-over studies and 117 in parallel-group studies, and compared the following NSAIDs versus placebo: naproxen (three studies), indomethacin (two studies) aspirin and fenoprofen (one study each). When we pooled studies NSAIDs were more likely than placebo to cause neurological adverse effects (OR 2.74, 95% CI 1.66 to 4.53, seven studies, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.11" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.11</LINK>). Two individual NSAIDs were associated with a higher incidence of events than placebo: naproxen (OR 2.20, 95% CI 1.11 to 4.35, three studies, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%) and indomethacin (4.96, 95% CI 1.87 to 13.11, two studies, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%).</P>

They analysed data for 1762 women, 959 in cross-over studies and 803 in parallel studies. They made the following comparisons: aspirin versus fenoprofen, diclofenac versus ibuprofen, etodolac versus piroxicam, ibuprofen versus fenoprofen, ibuprofen versus etoricoxib, mefenamic acid versus tolfenamic acid, and naproxen versus the following: aceclofenac, celecoxib (two studies), diclofenac, etoricoxib, ketoprofen, meclofenamate and piroxicam. When we pooled data for the six studies comparing naproxen versus other NSAIDs we found no evidence of a difference between the groups (<LINK REF="CMP-007.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 7.6</LINK>). Nor did we find any evidence of a difference between the groups in any individual study comparing any NSAIDs head-to-head.

<P>Although the direction of effect in the included studies consistently favoured NSAIDs, there was substantial heterogeneity (P value &lt; 0.1, I<SUP>2 </SUP>&gt; 50%) for some of the analyses, notably when the following NSAIDs were compared with placebo for dichotomous measures of pain relief: piroxicam (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 69%), mefenamic acid (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 61%), ibuprofen (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 60%) and naproxen (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 52%). The exclusion of two studies that reported no or negligible placebo effect, <LINK REF="STD-Akinluyi-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Akinluyi 1987</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Morrison-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Morrison 1980</LINK>, resulted in marked decreases in heterogeneity and lower effect measures, as follows: piroxicam (OR 5.81, 95% CI 3.15 to 10.72, two studies, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 40%), ibuprofen (OR 3.76, 95% CI 2.42 to 5.86, four studies, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%). When we combined all NSAIDs for this outcome the I<SUP>2 </SUP>value was 53%.</P>
<P>There was also substantial heterogeneity for the outcome of additional analgesics required, in comparisons of fenoprofen and ibuprofen versus placebo (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 61%, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 75% respectively), and in comparisons of naproxen versus celecoxib (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 69%). In the former case heterogeneity was attributable to a single study in which the requirement for additional analgesics was lower in the placebo group (<LINK REF="STD-Arnold-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Arnold 1983</LINK>), but there was no obvious explanation for the heterogeneity in the second instance, and both studies used a similar protocol.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Efficacy of NSAIDs</HEADING>
<P>The trials included in this review suggested that nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are very effective in providing pain relief from dysmenorrhoea. Almost all measures of effectiveness confirmed the overall superiority over placebo of all NSAIDs tested (with the exception of aspirin, about which the volume of evidence was very small). The evidence suggests that if 18% of women taking placebo achieve moderate or excellent pain relief, between 45% and 53% taking NSAIDs will do so.</P>
<P>When NSAIDs were compared with each other, most studies found no evidence of a difference between them. Despite the large number of included trials, only two reported data suitable for meta-analysis comparing the same two NSAIDs, and sample sizes were generally small. Thus the review was unable to determine which NSAIDs are most effective for dysmenorrhoea nor to determine whether individual NSAIDs have similar efficacy.</P>
<P>Three studies compared NSAIDs with paracetamol. Pooling of these studies found NSAIDs to be more effective for pain relief than paracetamol.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Tolerability and safety of NSAIDs</HEADING>
<P>As might be anticipated, NSAIDs appeared overall more likely than placebo to cause adverse effects. Mild neurological adverse effects (such as headache, drowsiness, dizziness and dryness) and gastrointestinal adverse effects (such as nausea and indigestion) were both more common in the NSAIDs group. It is important for women taking NSAIDs for dysmenorrhoea to be aware of the need to take the medications with food, even though they are administered only for short-term use.</P>
<P>Among individual NSAIDs, indomethacin was more likely to cause neurological side effects than placebo, dexketoprofen was more likely to cause gastrointestinal side effects and naproxen was more likely to cause both. The findings for naproxen probably relate to the large number of studies on naproxen, compared to other NSAIDs. When NSAIDs were compared with each other, there was no evidence of any difference between them with respect to adverse effects.</P>
<P>The large number of NSAIDs involved in these comparisons reflects the abundance of NSAIDs available. Others have been withdrawn from the world market after doubts emerged about their safety. All the NSAIDs included in comparisons in this review are currently available, to the best of our knowledge, in various parts of the world, but at least one (nimesulide) has been the subject of a risk/benefit review after safety concerns were raised (<LINK REF="REF-EMEA-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">EMEA 2002</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Traditional NSAIDs versus COX-2-specific inhibitors</HEADING>
<P>Although we retrieved a number of studies of COX-2 inhibitors in the search for the update of this review, we excluded several as they involved NSAIDs that have been withdrawn by the manufacturers due to safety concerns. We ultimately included only two COX-2-specific inhibitors in the review: celecoxib and etoricoxib. Celecoxib was less effective for pain relief than naproxen and there was no evidence of any difference between etoricoxib and naproxen. There was no evidence of any difference in tolerability between non-selective and COX-2-specific inhibitors, though data were very scarce.</P>

</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2015-07-15 01:50:05 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>As noted above, due to the lack of studies comparing NSAIDs head-to-head we were unable to determine which specific NSAID is most effective or whether individual NSAIDs have similar efficacy.</P>
<P>It would be useful to know whether it is possible to maintain the benefits of NSAIDs but reduce adverse effects by combining lower doses of NSAIDs with paracetamol, codeine, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) or acupuncture. It would also be useful to know whether dysmenorrhoea in intrauterine contraceptive device (IUCD) users can be treated in a similar way to primary dysmenorrhoea. However, these questions lie outside the scope of the present review.</P>

We excluded nearly 50 for unclear design, lack of double-blinding or very large numbers of withdrawals, while among the included studies very few clearly described their methods of randomisation and allocation concealment. Recently published studies appeared to be no more likely than older studies to adequately describe their methods (e.g. allocation concealment). Nearly 60% of the studies were co-authored or financially supported by pharmaceutical company associates and it was unclear how most of the others were funded. Moreover the funnel plot suggested a mild trend towards publication bias, with smaller negative studies less likely to be included in the review.</P>
<P>Reporting of pain relief using a dichotomous measure or visual analogue scale (VAS) provides clinically meaningful results and facilitates meta-analysis. The included studies used a wide variety of continuous pain scales as their primary or sole measure of effectiveness. We tried combining different continuous measures of final pain score and calculating the standardised mean difference, but findings were highly heterogeneous (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 77%), suggesting that the different scales may not have been measuring the same concept. We recommend the use of standard, validated scales for pain, such as VAS.</P>
<P>The measurement and reporting of adverse effects was generally poor, even taking into account the challenge of distinguishing between dysmenorrhoeic symptoms and medication effects. Only 30% of the studies described the use of prospective self report forms or diaries. The rest assessed adverse effects retrospectively at follow-up appointments, were vague about their methods or failed to systematically report adverse effects. It is important that studies report numerical results for all outcomes and not just for significant or selected findings. The available evidence suggests that if 10% of women taking placebo experience side effects, between 11% and 14% of women taking NSAIDs will do so.</P>
<P>As there were insufficient studies to conduct a sensitivity analysis to explore the effect of adequate allocation concealment and double-blinding, the extent to which bias affected estimates of effect is unclear. Moreover the funnel plot suggests the possibility of publication bias, which may have inflated the positive findings for NSAIDs in this review.</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2015-07-15 01:50:05 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The cross-over design requires that each study participant receives two or more treatments in a random order, each participant thus acting as her own control. Cross-over trials are suitable for evaluating interventions with a temporary effect in the treatment of stable, chronic conditions (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). This design was used by most of the included trials, and seems appropriate for exploring the use of NSAIDs for dysmenorrhoea, since dysmenorrhoea is a chronic, recurring problem and the half life of NSAIDs varies widely but is under 60 hours (<LINK REF="REF-Brooks-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brooks 1999</LINK>). In order for cross-over trials to be given adequate weight in meta-analysis, study authors need to report an explicit statement that they used paired statistical analysis, plus a summary effect measure and an estimate of variability for each outcome. As very few cross-over trials in the review provided this information, most were analysed as if they used a parallel design. As a result their findings may have been under-weighted in analysis, resulting in wider confidence intervals than would otherwise be the case. Sensitivity analysis excluding cross-over studies that did not meet these criteria resulted in a much higher estimate of analgesic effectiveness (odds ratio (OR) 7.04 versus OR 4.44). This was probably partly due to confounding by study age, since many of the studies included in the analysis were older parallel-group studies, which overall tended to report higher effect estimates than the more recent studies.</P>

<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2015-07-15 01:50:05 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Our findings are in accordance with a systematic review of NSAIDs and hormonal contraceptives for dysmenorrhoea published in 2010 (<LINK REF="REF-Zahradnik-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zahradnik 2010</LINK>), which was based on a search of a single database (PubMed). It included 10 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of NSAIDs and concluded that NSAIDs are suitable as a first-line therapy for treating dysmenorrhoea in women without wish for contraception. This review went on to suggest that combined oral contraceptives are a more suitable option for women requiring contraception. As noted above, the use of oral contraceptives for dysmenorrhoea is the topic of another Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-Wong-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wong 2009</LINK>).</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2015-07-15 02:49:10 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) appear to be a very effective treatment for dysmenorrhoea, though women using them need to be aware of the substantial risk that they may cause adverse effects such as indigestion or drowsiness. There is insufficient evidence to indicate whether any individual NSAID is more effective than others, but it appears that NSAIDs are more effective than paracetamol. Based on only two studies that made head-to-head comparisons, there was no evidence that COX-2-specific inhibitors are more effective or more tolerable than non-selective NSAIDs, for the treatment of dysmenorrhoea.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2015-07-15 01:50:05 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Large numbers of women are needed for comparison in order to achieve sufficient statistical power to reveal any meaningful differences in efficacy and safety between NSAIDs for dysmenorrhoea. This can most easily be achieved by meta-analysis. In order to facilitate this process, trial publications need to provide a detailed account of statistical methods used and present full results with summary effect measures and measures of variance. Attention to adequate reporting of trial methodology in line with the CONSORT statement, <LINK REF="REF-CONSORT-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">CONSORT 2001</LINK>, remains a fundamental issue.</P>
<P>If pain is measured as a continuous outcome, use of a validated scale such as a visual analogue scale (VAS) is recommended.</P>
<P>Outcomes of combination therapies in comparison with NSAIDs alone would be a useful topic for a further systematic review.</P>
