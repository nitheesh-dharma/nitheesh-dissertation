<P>
<B>Review question</B>
</P>
<P>The main question addressed by this review is: what is the optimal interval for dental check-ups (the time period between one dental check-up and the next)?</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>The effects on oral health and the economic impact of altering the recall interval between different types of dental check-ups are unclear. Primary care dental practitioners in many countries have traditionally recommended dental check-ups at six-monthly intervals.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>The Cochrane Oral Health Group carried out this review of existing studies, which includes evidence current up to 27 September 2013. This review includes one published study in which a total of 185 children and young adults were randomly chosen to have a clinical examination every 12 months or every 24 months. The study measured what effects the two different check-up times had on tooth decay and total time used per person (which could then be used to measure costs to the healthcare system).</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>The limited results did not enable a conclusion to be made about whether or not extending the time to the next dental check-up can reduce tooth decay or costs.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
</P>
<P>The evidence presented is of very low quality due to there only being one study and issues with the way it was conducted.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2013-12-18 13:51:52 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The frequency with which patients should attend for a dental check-up and the potential effects on oral health of altering recall intervals between check-ups have been the subject of ongoing international debate in recent decades. Although recommendations regarding optimal recall intervals vary between countries and dental healthcare systems, six-monthly dental check-ups have traditionally been advocated by general dental practitioners in many developed countries.</P>
<P>This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2005, and previously updated in 2007.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2013-12-18 13:52:07 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Luisa Fdez Mauleffinch">
<P>To determine the beneficial and harmful effects of different fixed recall intervals (for example six months versus 12 months) for the following different types of dental check-up: a) clinical examination only; b) clinical examination plus scale and polish; c) clinical examination plus preventive advice; d) clinical examination plus preventive advice plus scale and polish.<BR/>To determine the relative beneficial and harmful effects between any of these different types of dental check-up at the same fixed recall interval.<BR/>To compare the beneficial and harmful effects of recall intervals based on clinicians' assessment of patients' disease risk with fixed recall intervals.<BR/>To compare the beneficial and harmful effects of no recall interval/patient driven attendance (which may be symptomatic) with fixed recall intervals.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2013-12-18 13:52:39 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The following electronic databases were searched: the Cochrane Oral Health Group's Trials Register (to 27 September 2013), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (<I>The Cochrane Library </I>2013, Issue 9), MEDLINE via OVID (1946 to 27 September 2013) and EMBASE via OVID (1980 to 27 September 2013). We searched the US National Institutes of Health Trials Register (<A HREF="http://clinicaltrials.gov">http://clinicaltrials.gov</A>) and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (<A HREF="http://www.who.int/ictrp/en/">http://www.who.int/ictrp/en/</A>) for ongoing trials. Reference lists from relevant articles were scanned and the authors of some papers were contacted to identify further trials and obtain additional information. We did not apply any restrictions regarding language or date of publication when searching the electronic databases.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2013-12-17 16:10:45 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the effects of different dental recall intervals.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2013-12-18 13:53:13 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two review authors independently assessed the search results against the inclusion criteria of the review, extracted data and carried out risk of bias assessment. We contacted study authors for clarification or further information where necessary and feasible. If we had found more than one study with similar comparisons reporting the same outcomes, we would have combined the studies in a meta-analysis using a random-effects model if there were at least four studies, or a fixed-effect model if there were less than four studies. We expressed the estimate of effect as mean difference with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for continuous outcomes. We would have used risk ratios with 95% CI for any dichotomous outcomes.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-12-18 13:54:13 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included one study that analysed 185 participants. The study compared the effects of a clinical examination every 12 months with a clinical examination every 24 months on the outcomes of caries (decayed, missing, filled surfaces (dmfs/DMFS) increment) and economic cost outcomes (total time used per person). As the study was at high risk of bias, had a small sample size and only included low-risk participants, we rated the quality of the body of evidence for these outcomes as very low.</P>
<P>For three to five-year olds with primary teeth, the mean difference (MD) in dmfs increment was -0.90 (95% CI -1.96 to 0.16) in favour of 12-month recall. For 16 to 20-year olds with permanent teeth, the MD in DMFS increment was -0.86 (95% CI -1.75 to 0.03) also in favour of 12-month recall. There is insufficient evidence to determine whether 12 or 24-month recall with clinical examination results in better caries outcomes.</P>
<P>For three to five-year olds with primary teeth, the MD in time used by each participant was 10 minutes (95% CI -6.7 to 26.7) in favour of 24-month recall. For 16 to 20-year olds with permanent teeth, the MD was 23.7 minutes (95% CI 4.12 to 43.28) also in favour of 24-month recall. This single study at high risk of bias represents insufficient evidence to determine whether 12 or 24-month recall with clinical examination results in better time/cost outcomes.<BR/>

</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2013-12-18 13:54:33 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is a very low quality body of evidence from one RCT which is insufficient to draw any conclusions regarding the potential beneficial and harmful effects of altering the recall interval between dental check-ups. There is no evidence to support or refute the practice of encouraging patients to attend for dental check-ups at six-monthly intervals. It is important that high quality RCTs are conducted for the outcomes listed in this review in order to address the objectives of this review.</P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2013-12-18 14:14:41 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2013-12-18 14:00:58 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Healthcare providers' decisions about when to recall patients for their next visit are common to many outpatient encounters in longitudinal care. Such decisions directly affect provider workloads and have a potentially great impact on healthcare costs and outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-Chapko-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chapko 1999</LINK>). There is evidence of significant variation in physicians' recommendations about recall intervals (variously called 'revisit intervals', 're-examination intervals' or 'return intervals') for patients with many common ambulatory care conditions including diabetes mellitus, hypertension, angina and musculoskeletal pain (<LINK REF="REF-DeSalvo-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">DeSalvo 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Petitti-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Petitti 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schwartz-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schwartz 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tobacman-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tobacman 1992</LINK>). It has been suggested that the existence of such widespread variation may be an indication that physicians are uncertain about what interval is most appropriate and, further, that "a rational, information-based approach to the choice of revisit interval for common conditions could yield substantial savings in medical care costs" (<LINK REF="REF-Petitti-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Petitti 1993</LINK>).</P>
<P>Concerns about the clinical and cost-effectiveness of recall intervals have led to the emergence of research interest in understanding provider behaviour concerning appointment assignment and in the possible beneficial and harmful effects associated with varying recall intervals for specific types of care provided in primary care settings (<LINK REF="REF-Chapko-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chapko 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-DeSalvo-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">DeSalvo 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schwartz-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schwartz 1999</LINK>). In this context, there has been a longstanding international debate regarding the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of recall intervals for routine dental check-up examinations. This review looks at the evidence pertaining to the effects on oral health and the resource implications of different recall intervals for 'dental check-ups'.</P>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2013-12-17 16:47:09 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In the context of the provision of continuing dental care to patients, a 'recall visit' may be defined as "the planned, unprecipitated return of a patient who, when last seen was in good oral health" (<LINK REF="REF-Royal-College-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Royal College 1997</LINK>). A 'recall examination' (also referred to as a 'routine dental check-up' or an 'oral health review') is the examination performed at this planned return appointment. The 'recall interval' is the time period, usually specified in months or years, between recall examinations.</P>
<P>There is no universally recognised definition of the term 'routine dental check-up'. A routine dental check-up has been defined in the United Kingdom (UK) National Health Service (NHS) dental remuneration statement as "clinical examination, advice, charting (including monitoring of periodontal status) and report" (<LINK REF="REF-NHS-Executive-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">NHS Executive 2002</LINK>). The principal function of the 'clinical examination' component of the check-up is to detect the signs and symptoms of oral disease, in particular dental caries and periodontal disease. The primary dental health team is also regarded as having a role in the early detection of oral malignancy and potentially malignant lesions with a view to having a potential beneficial impact on the overall incidence, morbidity and mortality from oral cancer (<LINK REF="REF-Conway-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Conway 2002</LINK>). It has been argued that an examination for oral cancer, including a thorough medical and social history and a systematic examination of the oral mucosa, should form an integral part of all routine dental examinations (<LINK REF="REF-BDA-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">BDA 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Clovis-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clovis 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Conway-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Conway 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Field-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Field 1995</LINK>).</P>
<P>The 'advice' component of the dental recall examination is amenable to wide interpretation, but may be presumed to allude to professional advice directed towards the prevention of oral disease. Such advice may incorporate instruction on appropriate oral hygiene practices for the prevention of dental caries and periodontal disease (e.g. the use of fluoride toothpaste, appropriate toothbrushing techniques and other adjunctive methods of plaque control such as flossing), dietary advice (e.g. reducing the amount and frequency of intake of sugar containing foods and drinks) and advice aimed at modifying other risk factors for oral disease (e.g. the delivery of smoking cessation advice and alcohol reduction counselling).</P>
<P>The recall examination may therefore be construed as having a purported dual function as a primary and secondary preventive measure. The 'advice' component of the recall examination may be regarded as a primary preventive measure that seeks to influence patient behaviour with a view to preventing oral diseases before they occur. As a secondary preventive measure, a further aim of the check-up is to limit the progression and effect of oral diseases at as early a stage as possible after onset. This is achieved through the early detection of the signs and symptoms of oral diseases with a view to instituting clinical procedures and interventions which may have a favourable effect upon the natural history and clinical course of disease (<LINK REF="REF-Deep-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deep 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>Other functions that can be ascribed to the recall examination include the regular monitoring and preventive management of early carious lesions, the regular monitoring of stages of dental development to ensure that interventions are appropriate and timely (e.g. orthodontic treatment for malocclusions), the detection of the oral manifestations of systemic disease and appropriate referral for further investigation, the maintenance of dentist/patient rapport and the regular repetition and reinforcement of professional advice with a view to improving patient motivation and enhancing compliance with preventive recommendations. Recall examinations in the public dental services in some countries also regularly include specific preventive care such as the application of a fluoride gel or varnish (<LINK REF="REF-Wang-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wang 1995</LINK>).</P>
<P>The provision of a scale and polish at a recall examination is also common practice in primary dental care settings (<LINK REF="REF-Elley-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elley 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Frame-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Frame 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jones-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jones 2013</LINK>). Scaling can be defined as the mechanical removal of plaque, calcified deposits and staining from the crown and root surfaces of the teeth using manual or power-driven instrumentation or both. Polishing can be defined as the mechanical removal of any residual extrinsic stains and deposits that remain following the scaling procedure, using a rubber cup or bristle brush loaded with an abrasive or non-abrasive prophylaxis paste. In England, the traditional linking of the routine dental check-up and scale and polish treatments is reflected in NHS dental statistics which indicate that "half of all courses of dental treatment in England consist of consist of examination with or without diagnostic radiographs and scale and polish services" (<LINK REF="REF-Jones-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jones 2013</LINK>).</P>
<P>A dental check-up may therefore be associated with a "package of dental services" for a number of oral diseases and conditions (<LINK REF="REF-Spencer-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spencer 2009</LINK>). The recall interval between check-ups influences the frequency with which these services are provided. In many countries a six-monthly recall interval has become an established practice and is commonly recommended by dental practitioners engaged in primary care (<LINK REF="REF-AAPD-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">AAPD 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Anthonappa-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anthonappa 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Clarkson-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clarkson 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Frame-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Frame 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gussy-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gussy 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kay-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kay 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Patel-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Patel 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Scott-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scott 2002</LINK>). However, the clinical and cost-effectiveness of six-monthly recall intervals have increasingly been questioned in light of recent changes in the epidemiology of dental diseases and in the interests of cost-containment and judicious use of scarce resources (<LINK REF="REF-Audit-Commission-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Audit Commission 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-DoH-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">DoH 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-DoH-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">DoH 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-HDA-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">HDA 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sheiham-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sheiham 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tan-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tan 2006</LINK>).</P>

<P>The time period between dental check-ups may impact on oral health by influencing the periodicity of clinical examinations and any associated primary and secondary preventive measures. Short recall intervals (more frequent dental check-ups) may improve oral health by increasing the frequency with which the oral health of patients is reassessed and monitored and by allowing prompt preventive or therapeutic care to be delivered which may impact favourably on the clinical course of disease. However, short recall intervals may also increase the potential for iatrogenic overdiagnosis and overtreatment and may increase healthcare costs. In contrast, longer recall intervals may reduce iatrogenesis and short-term resource consumption but may also compromise oral health by reducing the frequency of the delivery of preventive advice and delaying the diagnosis of dental disease, thereby resulting in more extensive and costly care. In England it has also been argued that lengthening recall intervals for patients at low risk of or from dental disease "can allow NHS dentists and their teams to tackle health inequalities through having more time and resources to focus on providing access to new patients and prevention" (<LINK REF="REF-DoH-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">DoH 2011</LINK>).</P>

<P>The optimal length of the recall interval (how often to attend for a dental check-up) for the preventive maintenance of oral health in both children and adults has been the subject of ongoing debate in many countries (<LINK REF="REF-Clarkson-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clarkson 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-DTB-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">DTB 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Elderton-1985a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elderton 1985a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Elderton-1985b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elderton 1985b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kay-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kay 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lahti-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lahti 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lock-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lock 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Perlus-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Perlus 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Renson-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Renson 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Renson-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Renson 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sheiham-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sheiham 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sheiham-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sheiham 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sheiham-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sheiham 2000</LINK>). This debate has been fuelled by conflicting evidence from observational epidemiological studies on the beneficial and harmful effects of regular attendance and by diverging interpretations of that evidence. On the one hand, it has been reported that regular dental attendance is associated with improved oral health and that regular attenders have less untreated disease, lower rates of tooth loss, higher numbers of functioning teeth, and are less likely to suffer acute symptoms and to require emergency treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Murray-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Murray 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sheiham-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sheiham 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Todd-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Todd 1991</LINK>). An association between regular dental attendance and perception of how oral health affects quality of life has also been reported (<LINK REF="REF-McGrath-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">McGrath 2001</LINK>). In addition, it has been reported that regular attenders suffer significantly less from the severity, prevalence, social and psychological impacts of dental health problems (<LINK REF="REF-Richards-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Richards 2002</LINK>). On the other hand, it has also been argued that regular attenders do not experience any major advantage over irregular attenders in respect of their total disease experience and that regular visits do not help to prevent the onset of further disease (<LINK REF="REF-Sheiham-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sheiham 1985</LINK>). Based on an analysis of the results of the 1998 Adult Dental Health Survey in the United Kingdom (<LINK REF="REF-Kelly-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kelly 2000</LINK>), Sheiham has argued that occasional attenders had less periodontal disease, more teeth present and fewer missing teeth than regular attenders (<LINK REF="REF-Sheiham-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sheiham 2000</LINK>). Concerns have also been expressed about the financial implications for patients associated with regular attendance, including time foregone in attending for appointments, and the enhanced possibility for iatrogenic interventions associated with regular attendance (<LINK REF="REF-Reekie-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reekie 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sheiham-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sheiham 1985</LINK>).</P>
<P>The debate over the relative merits and demerits of regular versus irregular attendance has been further complicated by contemporary changes in the epidemiology of dental diseases, in particular dental caries. Since the 1970s the prevalence and severity of dental caries in many developed countries has decreased dramatically and the rate of progression of the disease has slowed (<LINK REF="REF-Brown-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brown 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mejare-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mejare 1999</LINK>
<U>;</U> <LINK REF="REF-Mejare-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mejare 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pitts-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pitts 1983</LINK>). Caries experience in many contemporary populations also exhibits a skewed distribution with a majority of children and adolescents having little or no disease, whilst for a minority the caries experience remains relatively high (<LINK REF="REF-Hausen-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hausen 1997</LINK>). In particular, it has been consistently observed that caries experience is generally more extensive and severe in lower socioeconomic status groups (<LINK REF="REF-Burt-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burt 1999</LINK>). These factors have led to suggestions in a number of countries that the notion of a 'fixed and universal' recall interval is inappropriate and that recall intervals should be patient specific (individualised) based on an assessment of the patient&#8217;s risk of or from oral disease (<LINK REF="REF-AAPD-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">AAPD 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Clarkson-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clarkson 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Deep-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deep 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-DoH-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">DoH 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-HDA-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">HDA 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lahti-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lahti 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Perlus-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Perlus 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Riordan-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Riordan 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>The rationale underpinning the risk-based recall approach for the management of dental caries is that it should be possible to extend recall intervals for those individuals classified as 'low caries risk' without incurring any undue detrimental effect on their oral health status and ultimately reducing resource consumption. Relatively shorter recall intervals can then be adopted for those individuals with the greatest need who are classified as 'high caries risk'. Similarly, for periodontal disease it has been argued that recall intervals should be individualised and based on an evaluation of the patient's oral hygiene, disease activity, individual susceptibility and disease history (<LINK REF="REF-Brothwell-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brothwell 1998</LINK>). In the UK, the justification for regular screening of all patients for oral cancer at six-monthly intervals has also been questioned on the grounds that the number of cases of oral malignancy is small and usually confined to patients at 'high risk' (due to tobacco use and excessive consumption of alcohol) over the age of 45 years (<LINK REF="REF-Sheiham-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sheiham 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sheiham-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sheiham 1980</LINK>).</P>
<P>Risk-assessment derived recall intervals for dental check-up examinations have recently been advocated by professional expert bodies and in clinical practice guidelines in several countries. For example, in the United States the American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry (AAPD) has stated that the periodicity of dental services should be based on a patient's individual needs and risk indicators and that some patients may require examination and preventive services at intervals more or less frequently than six months based upon historical, clinical and radiographic findings (<LINK REF="REF-AAPD-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">AAPD 2013</LINK>). In Western Australia the School Dental Service has adopted a practice of choosing recall intervals based on the clinician's assessment of a patient's risk of acquiring new disease (<LINK REF="REF-Lam-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lam 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Riordan-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Riordan 1997</LINK>). In England and Wales the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) have issued guidance recommending that the interval between oral health reviews "should be determined specifically for each patient and tailored to meet his or her needs, on the basis of an assessment of disease levels and risk of or from dental disease" (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>Although the concepts of assigning patient-specific and risk-based recall intervals have gained increasing currency, there remains significant variation in expert recommendations both within and between countries regarding the longest time interval between dental check-ups that can reasonably be assigned for patients who have been classified as 'low risk'. For example, the NICE guideline recommends that the longest interval between oral health reviews for patients younger than 18 years should be 12 months and that the interval should not exceed two years for older patients (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2004</LINK>). In contrast, Sheiham has argued that for low risk children (&lt; 18 years of age) and adults in the UK the recall intervals should be 18 months and two to three years respectively (<LINK REF="REF-Sheiham-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sheiham 2000</LINK>). Similarly, an expert group in Finland has recommended that recall intervals for low risk children and adolescents could be extended to 1.5 to two years without jeopardising their oral health (<LINK REF="REF-Lahti-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lahti 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>The disparities in these recommendations can be partially explained by the absence of good quality, reliable evidence to inform clinical practice. Many guideline recommendations regarding the frequency of recall examinations have been informed primarily by professional consensus (<LINK REF="REF-Tomar-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tomar 2011</LINK>), and it is inevitable that expert opinions will vary when the available evidence is weak and conflicting. The poor quality of the evidence base pertaining to the effects on oral health of varying recall intervals between dental check-ups has been highlighted in previous versions of this review (<LINK REF="REF-Beirne-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beirne 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Beirne-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beirne 2007</LINK>). It is important to continually update this review to incorporate any new evidence from randomised controlled trials that may be used to inform clinical practice guideline recommendations and that may facilitate clinical decision-making. This update has been carried to support UK National Guideline groups and US care providers, in response to requests for an up-to-date review of the latest evidence.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-12-18 14:10:07 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included one study which compared the effects of a clinical examination every 12 months with a clinical examination every 24 months on the outcomes of caries and time used per participant. We assessed the body of evidence using GRADE (<LINK REF="REF-GRADE-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">GRADE 2004</LINK>), which incorporates risk of bias of any included studies, the directness of the evidence, the inconsistency of the results, the precision of the estimates and the risk of publication bias (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>). We assessed the body of evidence, from one study analysing 185 participants with two-year follow-up, as being very low quality for caries and time outcomes, and for both primary and permanent teeth. We considered the available evidence insufficient to conclude whether or not there is a difference in these outcomes for primary or permanent teeth when varying the recall interval for a clinical examination.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2013-12-18 14:10:35 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The debate over appropriate recall intervals between dental check-ups for primary care patients was first initiated over three decades ago (<LINK REF="REF-Sheiham-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sheiham 1977</LINK>). Given the longevity of this debate and the potential impact of altering recall intervals on healthcare costs and outcomes and provider workloads, it is disappointing that there is a paucity of good quality and reliable research evidence that can be used to inform clinical practice. Only one randomised controlled trial satisfied the eligibility criteria for this review. This trial was judged to be at high risk of bias and hence the results presented therein should be interpreted cautiously. In addition, the study was carried out on low risk patients in the public dental services in Norway who had previously received regular dental care, including health promotion and preventive services; hence the extent to which the results of this study can be extrapolated and applied to different populations (with different baseline risk) and in different settings is unclear. No statistically significant differences in oral health (measured using dmfs/DMFS increments) were reported between 12-month and 24-month recall groups for both age groups (three to five years representing primary teeth and 16 to 20 years representing permanent teeth) in this single study. The total time taken per person was significantly shorter in the 24-month recall group compared with the 12-month group in the older age group but the limited quantity and quality of the evidence available from this one study preclude drawing any conclusions regarding the effects on oral health and the economic impact of altering recall intervals between dental check-ups.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2013-12-17 16:13:00 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The body of evidence is insufficient to address the objectives of this review. We downgraded the quality of the body of evidence due to there being a single study which was at high risk of performance and detection bias, resulting from a lack of blinding. The method of sequence generation was also unclear and allocation concealment was not mentioned at all. The evidence was further downgraded due to low sample size, resulting in imprecision, and due to indirectness of the evidence, resulting from the fact that only low risk patients were included. This population had also previously received regular dental care, including health promotion and preventive services. This means that those making recommendations on optimal recall intervals may not find the evidence currently in this review applicable to their setting.</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2013-12-13 17:11:57 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We have attempted to limit potential biases in the review process in several ways. We have tried to identify all relevant studies through sensitive searching of multiple databases, with no restriction on language or publication status. We attempted to contact study authors for clarification on eligibility or risk of bias issues. Finally, two authors carried out screening of search results, data extraction and risk of bias assessment independently and duplicate. </P>
</POTENTIAL_BIASES>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2013-12-18 14:14:04 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We are aware of three systematic reviews that have evaluated the effectiveness of routine dental check-ups of different recall intervals.</P>
<P>(1) A review that was carried out as part of the National Health Service (NHS) Research and Dissemination Health Technology Assessment (HTA) Programme in the UK (<LINK REF="REF-Davenport-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davenport 2003</LINK>) (the date of the last search carried out for this HTA review was February 2001).</P>
<P>(2) An update of this HTA review that was undertaken as part of the guideline development process for a National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guideline on appropriate recall intervals between dental check-ups (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2004</LINK>) (the date of the last search carried out for the 'updated' review was July 2003).</P>
<P>(3) A review that evaluated the effect of recall intervals on dental caries only (<LINK REF="REF-Patel-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Patel 2010</LINK>) (the date of the last search for this review was September 2008).</P>
<P>The selection criteria for these reviews differed from our review, most notably because they included non-randomised studies. In our review we excluded all study designs lacking the experimental element of random allocation of participants to an intervention, due to the susceptibility of such studies to selection biases and confounding. Bias and confounding are likely to be particularly problematic in non-randomised studies that involve making comparisons between the oral health status of 'regular' and 'irregular' attenders. Frequent attendance may simply be a marker for generally healthy behaviour and differences in general health behaviour may explain the different patterns in oral health between the comparison groups. Whilst statistical techniques can be used to adjust for known confounding factors in non-randomised studies, by definition, unknown confounders can only be balanced through randomisation. We therefore have some reservations regarding the merit of including non-randomised studies in systematic reviews evaluating the effects of varying recall intervals between dental check-ups. Nevertheless, we have summarised the findings of these reviews below.</P>
<P>(1) The authors of the HTA review (<LINK REF="REF-Davenport-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davenport 2003</LINK>) identified 28 studies for inclusion in their review. Many of the studies were poorly reported and methodologically and clinically heterogenous with inadequate description of patient and intervention (dental check-up) characteristics, thus limiting comparison between studies. In addition, there was a preponderance of cross-sectional studies included in the review, which are particularly prone to selection biases and confounding. There was no consistency across studies in the direction of effect of different dental check frequencies on measures of caries, periodontal disease or oral cancer. The review authors concluded that there was no high quality evidence to support or refute the practice of encouraging six-monthly dental checks in children and adults and that there was little evidence to suggest an optimal dental check frequency for any of the outcomes considered. The authors recommended that the quality of design and reporting of future research should be improved and that increased emphasis should be placed on patient-centred oral health outcomes.</P>
<P>(2) Thirteen additional observational epidemiological studies were identified in the update of the HTA review (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2004</LINK>). All studies were judged during the quality assessment process as having some threat to validity. A major limitation of the included studies was the method used to measure the frequency of the intervention (dental check-up). The majority of studies used a subjective measure of dental check frequency and relied on participants' reported attendance, obtained from self administered questionnaires or structured interviews. This may have compromised the validity of the data collected as it is reasonable to assume that attendance frequency is 'over estimated' in questionnaire/interview type surveys and there is some empirical evidence to support this assumption (<LINK REF="REF-Elderton-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elderton 1983</LINK>). A further limitation of the included studies related to the comparisons made. The most common comparison was between the oral health status of 'regular' and 'irregular' attenders. However, different studies used completely different definitions of what constituted 'regular' and 'irregular' attendance which imposed serious limitations on the inferences that could be drawn from this evidence. For example, in one study (<LINK REF="REF-Bullock-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bullock 2001</LINK>) a regular attender was defined as someone who attended for at least two dental examinations in the past two years. However, in another study (<LINK REF="REF-Richards-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Richards 2002</LINK>) a regular attender was defined as someone whose last attendance was within the last two years. A further problem with many of these non-randomised studies was the inability to distinguish between prevention oriented/motivated visits (for asymptomatic check-up) and treatment oriented/motivated visits for a specific problem such as infection, restoration failure or other clinical problems.</P>
<P>The review authors concluded that: a) the results of the updated review had no impact on the conclusions of the original HTA review; b) there was a paucity of evidence with which to inform clinical practice on assigning recall intervals; and c) further research was needed to examine the effects of varying dental recall intervals on oral health. In developing their recommendations, the guideline developers used evidence pertaining to risk factors for oral diseases and formal consensus methods and recommended that the recall interval between dental check-ups should be based on the clinician's professional assessment of a patient's risk of or from oral disease. The guideline recommends that this assessment should take into account the patient's medical history, social history, behavioural risk factors for oral disease and past and current disease levels. The full text of the 'Dental recall' guideline can be accessed through the NICE website (<A HREF="http://www.nice.org.uk">www.nice.org.uk</A>).</P>
<P>This NICE guideline was formally reviewed in 2008 (four-year review) and in 2012 (eight-year review). On both occasions it was recommended that the guideline should not be updated on the grounds that there was insufficient new evidence available to invalidate the current guideline recommendations.</P>
<P>(3) The authors of the review evaluating the effects of recall intervals on dental caries (<LINK REF="REF-Patel-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Patel 2010</LINK>) identified one randomised trial (this trial was also included in our review), two prospective non-randomised controlled trials, two retrospective chart reviews and one cross-sectional study that met the selection criteria. All studies were judged to be methodologically weak and the evidence was deemed insufficient "to support using any specific one-recall-interval-fits-all protocol for all patients" (<LINK REF="REF-Patel-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Patel 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>The findings of these reviews are therefore generally consistent with our review and point towards the urgent need for high quality research to address the uncertainty over the effects of altering recall intervals between dental check-ups. There is currently one multicentre, parallel-group randomised controlled trial in progress in the UK (the 'INTERVAL Dental Recalls Trial') (<LINK REF="STD-ISRCTN95933794" TYPE="STUDY">ISRCTN95933794</LINK>). The trial is due to be completed in 2017 and we will incorporate the results of this trial in future updates of our review. The trial is investigating whether risk-based recall intervals or a fixed-period 24-month recall are more effective and cost-effective in maintaining oral health than the traditional fixed-period six-monthly recall. We have provided additional details of this trial in the <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_ONGOING_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of ongoing studies</LINK> section of this review.</P>

<P>There is a need for well conducted randomised controlled trials in this area which include a sufficient number of participants to detect a true difference, if any, and that are of sufficient duration. The types of outcome measures used in these studies should include the clinical measures we have identified in this review (<LINK TAG="CRIT_OUTCOMES" TYPE="SECTION">Types of outcome measures</LINK>) as well as patient-centred factors and economic factors. The studies should also specify explicitly what the dental check-up actually entails (e.g. a clinical examination only or a clinical examination plus preventive advice) (<LINK TAG="CRIT_INTERVENTIONS" TYPE="SECTION">Types of interventions</LINK>). Furthermore, the precise nature and content of the preventive advice delivered as part of the dental check-up should be clearly specified. All trials should be reported according to the Consolidated Standards of Reporting of Trials (CONSORT) guidelines (<A HREF="http://www.consort-statement.org/">www.consort-statement.org/</A>).</P>

<P>Unable to contact authors to determine if this study was a randomised controlled trial (paper in German)<BR/>This study was fully translated with a view to determining its eligibility. However, we were unable to ascertain from this translation if it was a randomised trial. In addition the interventions and comparison groups were poorly described. The authors state that "55 test persons participated in this study. They had gingivitis caused by plaque at the age 15 and 25 years (17.7 years on average). Not included were pregnant women, patients with internal diseases, with prosthetic restorations and untreated caries. 15 test persons took part in 3 different programmes, over a period of 3 months that had the following objectives: oral hygiene instructions and motivation (dental nurse) as well as professional tooth cleaning (dentist). 1 group made up of 10 test persons (group IV) served as the control group. The programme of group III with 1 motivation session without teeth cleaning training was designed to check which results the frequent examination with an oral hygiene pass/check book produces. From the results of the test group we expected indications of the motivating effect of the professional teeth cleaning and of the importance for the reduction of gingivitis as such"</P>

<P>1. Health-related quality of life measured using an annual, self administered patient questionnaire. Questionnaire will include a global assessment of quality of life using short form Oral Health Impact Profile, a standardised measure of health outcome (EQ-5D) and a specially developed, context-specific, health-related quality of life measure<BR/>2. Periodontal disease assessed by gingival inflammation/bleeding measured according to the Gingival Index of Loe</P>
<P>
<B>Secondary</B>
<BR/>1. Caries experience assessed at both the enamel and dentine thresholds using the validated International Caries Detection and Assessment System (ICDAS). The ICDAS criteria measure both early and more advanced stages of caries. For early caries, ICDAS measures the surface changes and potential histological depth of carious lesions by relying on surface characteristics related to the optical properties of sound and demineralised enamel prior to cavitation. All surfaces of all teeth will be examined and the status of each recorded in terms of caries and restorations. This system allows the recording of both preventive and operative care needs<BR/>2. Plaque measured according to the Silness and Loe Plaque Index, calculus measured according to the Ramfjord Calculus Index and a colour-coded UNC periodontal probe will be used to measure periodontal pocket depth and clinical attachment level. The assessments will be made at 4 years by trained examiners who are blinded to allocation<BR/>3. Patient-centred outcomes including dental anxiety, oral health related knowledge, attitudes, and behaviours, use of and reason for use of dental services (including symptoms and pain), and satisfaction with care measured using annual, self administered questionnaire. Total duration of follow-up: 4 years<BR/>4. Dentist attitude towards the different recall strategies measured using a self administered questionnaire at month 0 and at 4 years<BR/>
<BR/>All clinical outcomes are measured at 4 years by trained examiners who are blinded to allocation</P>
