<P>
<B>Research question</B>
</P>
<P>This summary of a Cochrane review presents what we know from research about the effect of allopurinol compared with placebo or other treatments that reduce uric acid levels in treating people with chronic gout. The review is current to January 2014.</P>
<P>
<B>Background: what is chronic gout and what is allopurinol? </B>
</P>
<P>Chronic gout is a common type of inflammatory arthritis caused by high levels of uric acid in the blood leading to crystal formation in the joints. Allopurinol is a medication that helps to lower blood uric acid levels.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>After searching for all relevant studies, we found 11 studies that included 4531 adults with chronic gout. Two studies compared various doses of allopurinol (ranging from 100 to 300 mg daily) with placebo; four compared allopurinol with febuxostat; two compared allopurinol with benzbromarone; and one study each compared allopurinol with colchicine or probenecid. Two studies compared different treatment doses or administration methods of allopurinol. We considered allopurinol compared with placebo as the main comparison, and present results fully below.</P>

<P>Pain, function and tophus regression were not reported in sufficient detail to present results.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
</P>
<P>In people with chronic gout, moderate-quality evidence indicated that, compared with placebo, allopurinol (100 to 300 mg daily) probably does not reduce the number of acute gout attacks, but does increase the proportion achieving target serum urate levels, without increasing withdrawals due to AEs or serious adverse event rates. Further research may change the estimates. Pain and tophus regression were not reported sufficiently to calculate group differences. Function was not measured.</P>
<P>In people with chronic gout, compared with febuxostat (80 mg daily), low-quality evidence indicated that allopurinol (100 to 300 mg daily) may not reduce the number of acute gout attacks, and may be less effective in achieving target serum urate levels, without increasing withdrawals due to AEs, or serious adverse event rates. Further research is likely to change the estimates. Tophus regression was not reported sufficiently to calculate group differences. Pain and function were not measured.</P>
<P>In people with chronic gout, compared with benzbromarone (up to 200 mg daily), allopurinol (up to 600 mg daily) may not reduce the number of acute gout attacks (low-quality evidence), probably does not increase the proportion achieving target serum urate levels, or the withdrawals due to AEs or serious adverse event rates (moderate-quality evidence). Further research may change the estimates. Tophus regression was not reported sufficiently to calculate group differences and pain and function were not measured.</P>
<P>The evidence was downgraded due to limitations in study design indicating potential bias, and possible imprecision. All other comparisons were supported by small, single studies only, limiting conclusions.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2014-09-08 06:14:54 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson">
<P>Allopurinol, a xanthine oxidase inhibitor, is considered one of the most effective urate-lowering drugs and is frequently used in the treatment of chronic gout.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2014-09-04 00:52:43 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson">
<P>To assess the efficacy and safety of allopurinol compared with placebo and other urate-lowering therapies for treating chronic gout.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2014-09-03 22:34:03 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE and EMBASE on 14 January 2014. We also handsearched the 2011 to 2012 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) and European League against Rheumatism (EULAR) abstracts, trial registers and regulatory agency drug safety databases.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2014-09-08 05:26:38 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson">
<P>All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi-randomised controlled clinical trials (CCTs) that compared allopurinol with a placebo or an active therapy in adults with chronic gout.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2014-09-08 01:39:54 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson">
<P>We extracted and analysed data using standard methods for Cochrane reviews. The major outcomes of interest were frequency of acute gout attacks, serum urate normalisation, pain, function, tophus regression, study participant withdrawal due to adverse events (AE) and serious adverse events (SAE). We assessed the quality of the body of evidence for these outcomes using the GRADE approach.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-09-08 18:08:47 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson">
<P>We included 11 trials (4531 participants) that compared allopurinol (various doses) with placebo (two trials); febuxostat (four trials); benzbromarone (two trials); colchicine (one trial); probenecid (one trial); continuous versus intermittent allopurinol (one trial) and different doses of allopurinol (one trial). Only one trial was at low risk of bias in all domains. We deemed allopurinol versus placebo the main comparison, and allopurinol versus febuxostat and versus benzbromarone as the most clinically relevant active comparisons and restricted reporting to these comparisons here.</P>
<P>Moderate-quality evidence from one trial (57 participants) indicated allopurinol 300 mg daily probably does not reduce the rate of gout attacks (2/26 with allopurinol versus 3/25 with placebo; risk ratio (RR) 0.64, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.12 to 3.52) but increases the proportion of participants achieving a target serum urate over 30 days (25/26 with allopurinol versus 0/25 with placebo, RR 49.11, 95% CI 3.15 to 765.58; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 1). In two studies (453 participants), there was no significant increase in withdrawals due to AE (6% with allopurinol versus 4% with placebo, RR 1.36, 95% CI 0.61 to 3.08) or SAE (2% with allopurinol versus 1% with placebo, RR 1.93, 95% CI 0.48 to 7.80). One trial reported no difference in pain reduction or tophus regression, but did not report outcome data or measures of variance sufficiently and we could not calculate the differences between groups. Neither trial reported function.</P>
<P>Low-quality evidence from three trials (1136 participants) indicated there may be no difference in the incidence of acute gout attacks with allopurinol up to 300 mg daily versus febuxostat 80 mg daily over eight to 24 weeks (21% with allopurinol versus 23% with febuxostat, RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.1); however more participants may achieve target serum urate level (four trials; 2618 participants) with febuxostat 80 mg daily versus allopurinol 300 mg daily (38% with allopurinol versus 70% with febuxostat, RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.48 to 0.65, NNTB with febuxostat 4). Two trials reported no difference in tophus regression between allopurinol and febuxostat over a 28- to 52-week period; but as the trialists did not provide variance, we could not calculate the mean difference between groups. The trials did not report pain reduction or function. Moderate-quality evidence from pooled data from three trials (2555 participants) comparing allopurinol up to 300 mg daily versus febuxostat 80 mg daily indicated no difference in the number of withdrawals due to AE (7% with allopurinol versus 8% with febuxostat, RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.26) or SAE (4% with allopurinol versus 4% with febuxostat, RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.82) over a 24- to 52-week period.</P>
<P>Low-quality evidence from one trial (65 participants) indicated there may be no difference in the incidence of acute gout attacks with allopurinol up to 600 mg daily compared with benzbromarone up to 200 mg daily over a four-month period (0/30 with allopurinol versus 1/25 with benzbromarone, RR 0.28, 95% CI 0.01 to 6.58). Based on the pooled results of two trials (102 participants), there was moderate-quality evidence of no probable difference in the proportion of participants achieving a target serum urate level with allopurinol versus benzbromarone (58% with allopurinol versus 74% with benzbromarone, RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.11). Low-quality evidence from two studies indicated there may be no difference in the number of participants who withdrew due to AE with allopurinol versus benzbromarone over a four- to nine-month period (6% with allopurinol versus 7% with benzbromarone, pooled RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.18 to 3.58). There were no SAEs. They did not report tophi regression, pain and function.</P>
<P>All other comparisons were supported by small, single studies only, limiting conclusions.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2014-09-08 18:10:48 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson">
<P>Our review found low- to moderate-quality evidence indicating similar effects on withdrawals due to AEs and SAEs and incidence of acute gout attacks when allopurinol (100 to 600 mg daily) was compared with placebo, benzbromarone (100 to 200 mg daily) or febuxostat (80 mg daily). There was moderate-quality evidence of little or no difference in the proportion of participants achieving target serum urate when allopurinol was compared with benzbromarone. However, allopurinol seemed more successful than placebo and may be less successful than febuxostat (80 mg daily) in achieving a target serum urate level (6 mg/dL or less; 0.36 mmol/L or less) based on moderate- to low-quality evidence. Single studies reported no difference in pain reduction when allopurinol (300 mg daily) was compared with placebo over 10 days, and no difference in tophus regression when allopurinol (200 to 300 mg daily) was compared with febuxostat (80 mg daily). None of the trials reported on function, health-related quality of life or participant global assessment of treatment success, where further research would be useful.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2014-09-08 06:16:32 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2014-09-08 06:16:32 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson">
<P>Gout is the most common inflammatory arthritis in men over the age of 40 years, and has increasing prevalence among postmenopausal women (<LINK REF="REF-Chohan-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chohan 2009</LINK>). It results from the deposition of monosodium urate (MSU) crystals in and around joints and soft tissues (<LINK REF="REF-Schlesinger-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schlesinger 2004</LINK>). Formation of uric acid crystals requires hyperuricaemia defined as serum urate concentration above its solubility limit (6.8 mg/dL (0.41 mmol/L)) supersaturating the body fluids (<LINK REF="REF-Schumacher-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schumacher 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>Gout can evolve from asymptomatic hyperuricaemia to acute gout, which is characterised by the rapid onset of severe pain, swelling and redness of the affected joint. The period between attacks when the person is asymptomatic is referred to as inter-critical gout. The final stage is chronic gout, characterised by the formation of tophi, which are nodular masses of MSU crystals deposited in the soft tissues of the body that can contribute to joint damage (<LINK REF="REF-Klippel-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Klippel 1994</LINK>). Furthermore, hyperuricaemia can be associated with renal damage secondary to interstitial MSU crystal deposition and the formation of renal stones (<LINK REF="REF-Schlesinger-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schlesinger 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>The treatment of acute gout attacks is aimed at controlling the inflammatory response and alleviating pain, and the drugs commonly used for this are non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), colchicine and glucocorticoids (<LINK REF="REF-Wortmann-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wortmann 2002</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2014-09-08 05:48:27 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson">
<P>As elevated serum uric acid (sUA) concentration is the most important determinant for the risk of developing gout (<LINK REF="REF-Klippel-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Klippel 1994</LINK>), treatment is aimed at reducing hyperuricaemia. This prevents gouty attacks and the sequelae of long-standing hyperuricaemia, such as chronic tophaceous gout and uric acid stones (<LINK REF="REF-Schlesinger-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schlesinger 2004</LINK>). Maintaining the sUA level below saturating levels at a target of 6 mg/dL or less (or 0.36 mmol/L or less) is important in the treatment of chronic gout to reduce or reverse clinical events (<LINK REF="REF-Jordan-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jordan 2007</LINK>). The urate-lowing drugs available to treat chronic gout are:</P>
<OL>
<LI>uricostatic drugs, which reduce urate production such as xanthine oxidase (XO) inhibitors, including allopurinol and febuxostat;</LI>
<LI>uricosuric drugs, which increase urate excretion, including probenecid, benzbromarone and sulphinpyrazone;</LI>
<LI>recombinant uricases, which catalyse the oxidation of uric acid to allantoin thereby lowering sUA, such as pegloticase and rasburicase (allantoin is an inert, water-soluble purine metabolite, which is readily eliminated, primarily by renal excretion).</LI>
</OL>
<P>Allopurinol is considered first-line therapy for prevention of gout. The initial recommended dose of allopurinol is up to 100 mg daily, with a lower dose of 50 mg daily suggested in stage 4 or worse chronic kidney disease. The dose of allopurinol can be gradually titrated upwards every two to five weeks to an appropriate maximum dose in order to achieve a serum urate level target at a minimum of 6 mg/dL or less, which is the serum saturation point to prevent crystal formation, and may be lowered to 5 mg/dL (0.3 mmol/L) in some people with gout. The dosage of allopurinol can be raised above 300 mg daily, even in people with renal impairment, provided that the person receives adequate education and monitoring for drug toxicity (including measurement of transaminase levels). The maximum dosage of allopurinol approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is 800 mg daily, but the maximum dosage should be lower in people with chronic kidney disease (<LINK REF="REF-Khanna-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Khanna 2012</LINK>).<BR/>

<THEORY MODIFIED="2014-09-04 00:51:11 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson">
<P>Allopurinol is a uricostatic drug that limits the production of uric acid. It is an isomer of hypoxanthine, which inhibits XO, thereby preventing the conversion of hypoxanthine to xanthine and xanthine to uric acid (<LINK REF="REF-Wallace-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wallace 1988</LINK>). This helps prevent uric acid crystal accumulation in the joints and tissues, thereby preventing attacks of gout and the sequelae of long-standing hyperuricaemia, such as chronic tophaceous gout and uric acid stones.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2014-09-04 00:52:10 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson">
<P>Allopurinol is one of the most effective urate-lowering drugs for gout and is frequently used. However, about 2% of people develop hypersensitivity reactions (<LINK REF="REF-Dalbeth-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dalbeth 2007</LINK>), and 20% of those are severe, including rash, toxic epidermal necrolysis, hepatitis, interstitial nephritis and death (<LINK REF="REF-Wortmann-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wortmann 2002</LINK>). Therefore, it is clinically relevant to review the benefit and safety of allopurinol for the treatment of chronic gout systematically.</P>

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2014-09-04 20:36:47 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson">
<P>Two review authors (RS and AK) independently assessed risk of bias of all included studies using The Cochrane Collaboration's tool for assessing risk of bias (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011a</LINK>). This included assessing the bias in each of the following domains: random sequence generation; allocation concealment; blinding of participants, personnel and outcome assessors; completeness of outcome data; selective reporting and other sources of bias (including whether there was carry-over effect from previous therapies, whether appropriate co-intervention (e.g. colchicine or NSAIDs) were administered and whether any pre-administered interventions could have diminished the effect of the subsequent randomised intervention).</P>

<EFFECT_MEASURES MODIFIED="2014-09-04 20:38:45 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson">
<P>We summarised the data in a meta-analysis only if there was sufficient clinical homogeneity.</P>
<P>For dichotomous data, we presented the results as risk ratios (RR) with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI). An RR greater than 1.0 indicated a beneficial effect of allopurinol.</P>
<P>For continuous data, we presented the results as mean differences (MD) between the intervention and comparator groups with the corresponding 95% CIs.</P>
<P>When different scales were used to measure the same conceptual domain, we planned to calculate the standardised mean differences (SMD) with corresponding 95% CIs instead. For the calculation of SMD, MD was divided by the SD, resulting in a unitless measure of treatment effect. SMDs larger than zero indicated a beneficial effect of allopurinol. An SMD of 0.2 indicated a small beneficial effect, 0.5 a medium effect and 0.8 a large effect in favour of allopurinol. We had planned to re-express SMDs as MD by multiplying the SMD by a typical among-person SD using a familiar scale in order to facilitate appraisal by clinicians (<LINK REF="REF-Sch_x00fc_nemann-2011b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schünemann 2011b</LINK>); however, we did not need to do this.</P>

<UNIT_OF_ANALYSIS MODIFIED="2014-03-07 05:27:46 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We assessed whether each study evaluated the number of people with acute flares or the number of acute flares as a unit of analysis, and we evaluated the number of people with acute flares as the preferred outcome.</P>
<P>We planned to avoid a potential unit of analysis issue by making multiple pair-wise comparisons between all possible pairs of intervention groups for trials with multiple treatment groups, or alternatively, by including only the pair with accepted drug dosages (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011c" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011c</LINK>).</P>

<MISSING_DATA MODIFIED="2014-09-08 04:53:48 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson">
<P>If data were missing or incomplete, we planned to obtain further information from the study authors, but this was not necessary.</P>
<P>We had planned that in cases where individual data were missing from the reported results and no further information was available from the study authors, we would assume the missing values to have a poor outcome. For dichotomous variables that measured AEs, we would have calculated the withdrawal rate using the number of participants who received the treatment as the denominator (worst-case analysis). For dichotomous outcomes that measured benefits, we would have calculated the worst-case analysis using the number of randomised participants as the denominator. For continuous variables, we planned to calculate the MD or the SMD based on the number of participants analysed at each time point. If the number of participants analysed was not available, we would have used the number of randomised participants in each group at baseline.</P>
<P>Where possible, we would have calculated missing SDs from other statistics such as standard errors, CIs or P values, according to methods recommended in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011b</LINK>).

<BIAS_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2014-09-08 04:53:50 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson">
<P>To assess the potential for reporting bias, we determined whether the protocol of the trial was published before recruitment of participants began. For trials published after 1 July 2005, we screened the Clinical Trials Register at the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform of the World Health Organization (WHO) (<A HREF="http://apps.who.int/trialsearch/">apps.who.int/trialsearch/</A>). We evaluated whether selective reporting of outcomes was present.</P>
<P>We planned to compare the fixed-effect model estimate against the random-effects model estimate to assess the possible presence of small-sample bias in the published literature (i.e. in which the intervention effect was more beneficial in smaller studies). In the presence of small-sample bias, the random-effects estimate of the intervention was more beneficial than the fixed-effect estimate (<LINK REF="REF-Sterne-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sterne 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>We planned to explore the potential for small-study effects in the main outcomes of the review using funnel plots if at least 10 studies were included in a meta-analysis; however, this was not undertaken due to the lack of studies.</P>

<DATA_SYNTHESIS MODIFIED="2014-09-08 06:22:18 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson">

<SUBGROUP_ANALYSIS MODIFIED="2014-09-08 04:53:54 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson">
<P>We hypothesised that responses to treatment may differ according to the participant's age and gender. Elderly participants can present with more associated conditions and possibly a greater chance of adverse effects (<LINK REF="REF-Busquets-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Busquets 2011</LINK>), while reports indicate that gout in women may have different epidemiological and clinical characteristics compared with gout in men (<LINK REF="REF-Harrold-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harrold 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>Therefore, we planned the following subgroup analyses if sufficient data were available:</P>

<P>We had planned to extract the outcome 'acute gout attacks' separately for men and women, and the outcome 'withdrawals due to adverse events' separately by age subgroups from within each trial. We also planned to compare the magnitudes of effect informally to assess possible differences in response to treatment by considering the overlap of the CIs of the summary estimates in the two subgroups with non-overlap of the CIs indicating statistical significance. However, the outcomes were not reported by subgroups within the trials, thereby precluding the planned analyses.</P>

<P>We presented the main results in 'Summary of findings' tables.

<P>The 'Summary of findings' tables show the three most clinically relevant comparisons, as deemed by the review authors (RS, AK, RB), including allopurinol versus placebo, allopurinol versus febuxostat and allopurinol versus benzbromarone.</P>
<P>In the comments column, we calculated the absolute percentage change and the relative percentage change; and, for outcomes with statistically significant differences between intervention groups, we calculated the number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB), or the number needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome (NNTH).</P>
<P>For dichotomous outcomes, we calculated the absolute risk difference using the risk difference statistic in Review Manager 5 (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2011</LINK>), and expressed the result as a percentage; we calculated the relative percentage change as the RR - 1 and expressed it as a percentage; and determined the NNT from the control group event rate and the RR using the Visual Rx NNT calculator (<LINK REF="REF-Cates-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cates 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>For continuous outcomes, we would have calculated the absolute risk difference as the MD between intervention and control groups in the original measurement units (divided by the scale), expressed as a percentage; we would have calculated the relative difference as the absolute change (or MD) divided by the baseline mean of the control group from a representative trial; however, we did not need to do this.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Schumacher-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Schumacher 2008</LINK> performed a multicentre, three-armed, double-blind RCT (the Allopurinol and Placebo-Controlled, Efficacy Study of Febuxostat (APEX) trial) including 1072 participants, with gout as per ARA criteria, and compared allopurinol 100 or 300 mg daily based on renal function with febuxostat 80, 120 or 240 mg daily or placebo. Additional medication included colchicine 0.6 mg once daily or naproxen 250 mg twice daily during the washout period for people receiving prior urate-lowering therapies or on randomisation for people not on prior urate-lowering therapy. These medications were continued for the first eight weeks of the study as prophylaxis for gout flares. The investigator used their own judgement in selecting between naproxen and colchicine, although colchicine was recommended for people with a serum creatinine level greater than 1.5 mg/dL. Study treatment was taken for 28 weeks and outcomes were assessed every four weeks. The primary efficacy end point was the proportion of participants with the last three monthly serum urate levels less than 6.0 mg/dL (less than 0.36 mmol/L). Overall, outcome assessments were made on three out of the seven essential domains proposed by OMERACT. The study end points were acute gout attack frequency, serum urate (both change in serum urate and serum urate less than 6 mg/dL) and tophus regression. Safety as assessed by the number of study participant withdrawals due to AEs and SAEs were also reported.</P>

After 10 days, participants in the placebo arm were also started on allopurinol 300 mg daily. Duration of the trial was 90 days (as colchicine was continued for 90 days) and outcomes were assessed at day one, three, 10 and 30 plus or minus three days to accommodate weekends or conflicts. All participants received additional medications including colchicine 0.6 mg twice daily for 90 days and indomethacin 50 mg three times daily for 10 days.

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Allopurinol versus placebo</HEADING>
<P>While the efficacy data from the two trials that compared allopurinol with placebo could not be pooled due to lack of clinical homogeneity with differences in trial design, they did report similar results, and we pooled the safety data from these two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Schumacher-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Schumacher 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Taylor-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Taylor 2012</LINK>).</P>
<P>One trial with 1072 participants, judged to be at unclear risk of bias, compared a dose of up to 300 mg of allopurinol (dependent on renal function) with placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Schumacher-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Schumacher 2008</LINK>). There was no between-group difference in the proportion of participants requiring treatment for gout flares in the first eight weeks of the trial (during the period of co-administration of naproxen 250 mg twice daily or colchicine 0.6 mg daily) when allopurinol was compared with placebo (61/268 (23%) in allopurinol group versus 27/134 (20%) in placebo group, RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.69) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>). The authors also reported no between-group difference in gout flares between weeks eight and 28 although these data were not provided.</P>
<P>The second trial with 57 participants, judged to be at low risk of bias, compared the initiation of allopurinol 300 mg during an acute attack of gout versus placebo for 10 days followed by allopurinol 300 mg daily (<LINK REF="STD-Taylor-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Taylor 2012</LINK>). They reported no between-group difference in the rate of new or recurrent gout attacks between days one and 30 when allopurinol was compared with 10 days of placebo and then allopurinol (2/26 (7.7%) in allopurinol group versus 3/25 (12%) in placebo group, RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.12 to 3.52) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>). Both treatment groups also received colchicine for 90 days and indomethacin for 10 days from trial commencement.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Schumacher-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Schumacher 2008</LINK> reported that participants in the allopurinol group were more likely to achieve a target serum urate level less than 6.0 mg/dL (0.36 mmol/L) with the last three monthly serum urate measurements (103/263 in allopurinol group versus 1/127 in placebo group, RR 49.25, 95% CI 6.95 to 349.02) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>). For the subgroup with impaired renal function, none of the participants in the allopurinol 100 mg daily group (1/10) or placebo group (0/5) achieved this target. <LINK REF="STD-Taylor-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Taylor 2012</LINK> reported that the serum urate levels decreased rapidly in the allopurinol group, reaching less than 6.5 mg/dL by day 10 for all but one of the participants while none of the 25 placebo group participants achieved this end point (25/26 in allopurinol group versus 0/25 in placebo group, RR 49.11, 95% CI 3.15 to 765.58) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>), and the NNTB was 1 (95% CI 1.04 to 1.35). <LINK REF="STD-Taylor-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Taylor 2012</LINK> reported no between-group differences with respect to pain reduction to day 10 (no measure of variance reported). <LINK REF="STD-Schumacher-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Schumacher 2008</LINK> reported no between-group differences in number of tophi or tophus regression but did not provide the data. Neither trial provided data for function, participant global assessment of treatment success or quality of life.</P>
<P>Pooled analysis showed no between-group difference in the number of participants who withdrew due to AEs (19/294 in allopurinol group versus 7/159 in placebo group, RR 1.37, 95% CI 0.61 to 3.09) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>), total AE (210/294 in allopurinol group versus 110/159 in placebo group, RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.14) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.4</LINK>) or SAE (8/294 in allopurinol group versus 2/159 in placebo group, RR 1.93, 95% CI 0.48 to 7.80) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.5</LINK>), when allopurinol was compared with placebo.</P>
<P>The reasons for withdrawal in the allopurinol groups in both trials were abnormal liver function tests, diarrhoea and a gout attack less than 24 hours after starting allopurinol. An elevation in creatinine greater than 1.5 mg/dL occurred in one participant in each study arm in <LINK REF="STD-Taylor-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Taylor 2012</LINK>. One participant died unexpectedly (after receiving four doses of allopurinol) from gastroenteritis, pneumonia, fever, dehydration and acute renal failure. The authors did not state whether or not they considered it related to the study medication (<LINK REF="STD-Schumacher-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Schumacher 2008</LINK>). One participant initially in the placebo group had a hypersensitivity reaction with rash, fever and mild transaminitis leading to discontinuation of allopurinol at day 30 (<LINK REF="STD-Taylor-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Taylor 2012</LINK>), and we have excluded from the data analysis as both placebo and allopurinol were given to this participant.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Allopurinol plus colchicine versus colchicine alone</HEADING>
<P>One trial including 59 participants, judged to be at high risk of bias, compared allopurinol 200 mg daily plus colchicine 0.5 mg twice daily with colchicine 0.5 mg twice daily alone (<LINK REF="STD-Gibson-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Gibson 1982</LINK>). There was no between-group difference in the number of gout attacks in the first year of treatment (recurrent attacks: 5/26 in allopurinol plus colchicine group versus 10/33 in colchicine alone group, RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.25 to 1.63) (<LINK REF="CMP-002.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.1</LINK>). The mean serum urate level after two years was reported to be significantly lower in the allopurinol plus colchicine group (mean ± SD: 0.28 ± 0.07 in allopurinol plus colchicine group versus 0.37 ± 0.1 in colchicine only group, between-group difference and variance not provided). Three participants in the allopurinol plus colchicine group were analysed in the colchicine group because they were non-compliant with medication. No data for joint pain, function, quality of life, participant global assessment of treatment success, tophus regression or safety were provided.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Allopurinol versus probenecid</HEADING>
<P>One trial including 40 participants, judged to be at high risk of bias, compared allopurinol 300 to 600 mg daily with probenecid (1 g daily increasing to 2 g daily after two weeks) (<LINK REF="STD-Scott-1966" TYPE="STUDY">Scott 1966</LINK>). The trial authors did not provide any statistical analyses. From the data presented, there did not appear to be a between-group difference in the number of gout attacks reported over the duration of the study (11/20 in allopurinol group versus 9/17 in probenecid group). Mean (range) serum urate was reported to decrease from 9.3 (7.5 to 10.6) mg/dL at baseline to 4.7 (2.6 to 5.5) mg/dL at the final end point in the allopurinol group and 8.5 (7.5 to 11.7) mg/dL at baseline to 5.2 (3.8 to 7.3) mg/dL at final end point in the probenecid group (no measures of variance were reported). Of those participants with tophi (five overall), disappearance of tophi occurred in two of three participants in the allopurinol group and one of two in the probenecid group. None of our other pre-specified efficacy outcomes were reported, therefore we extracted no other outcomes. There did not appear to be any between-group difference in number of adverse effects and no SAEs were reported in either group.</P>

Febuxostat doses varied between 40 or 80 mg daily (<LINK REF="STD-Becker-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Becker 2010</LINK>); 80 or 120 mg daily (<LINK REF="STD-Becker-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Becker 2005</LINK>); 80, 120 or 240 mg daily (<LINK REF="STD-Schumacher-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Schumacher 2008</LINK>); or 80 mg daily (<LINK REF="STD-Singal-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Singal 2011</LINK>). All participants in the three larger trials received acute gout prophylaxis during the first two months of treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Becker-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Becker 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Becker-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Becker 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schumacher-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Schumacher 2008</LINK>), whereas participants in the smaller trial did not receive any flare prophylaxis (<LINK REF="STD-Singal-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Singal 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>Pooled analyses showed that there was no between-group difference in the frequency of acute gout attacks when allopurinol up to 300 mg daily was compared with febuxostat 80 mg daily (118/569 in allopurinol group versus 132/567 in febuxostat 80 mg group, RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.10) (<LINK REF="CMP-003.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.1</LINK>) based on three trials (<LINK REF="STD-Becker-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Becker 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schumacher-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Schumacher 2008;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Singal-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Singal 2011</LINK>).

Participants taking allopurinol had significantly fewer acute gout attacks compared with participants taking higher doses of febuxostat based on two trials (116/519 in allopurinol group versus 187/519 in febuxostat 120 mg group, RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.51 to 0.76) (<LINK REF="STD-Becker-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Becker 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schumacher-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Schumacher 2008</LINK>), and based on one trial (61/268 in allopurinol group versus 69/134 in febuxostat 240 mg group, RR 0.44 95% CI 0.34 to 0.58) (<LINK REF="STD-Schumacher-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Schumacher 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>Achievement of a target serum urate less than 6 mg/dL at final end point (six to 12 months) could be pooled for up to four trials depending on dose of febuxostat in the control group. One trial reported no difference between allopurinol 200 or 300 mg daily and febuxostat 40 mg daily at final end point (six months) (number achieving target serum urate: 318/755 in allopurinol group versus 342/757 in febuxostat 40 mg daily group, RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.05) (<LINK REF="CMP-003.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.2</LINK>) (<LINK REF="STD-Becker-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Becker 2010</LINK>).

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Allopurinol versus benzbromarone</HEADING>
<P>We considered data from two trials that compared allopurinol with benzbromarone to be sufficiently clinically homogeneous to be pooled (<LINK REF="STD-Perez_x002d_Ruiz-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Perez-Ruiz 1999;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Reinders-2009a" TYPE="STUDY">Reinders 2009a</LINK>). One trial that included 37 participants, judged to be at high risk of bias, compared allopurinol (100-150 mg daily initially, titrated to 100, 200 or 300 mg daily according to creatinine clearance) with benzbromarone (100 mg daily titrated with increments of 50 mg daily to 200 mg daily) (<LINK REF="STD-Perez_x002d_Ruiz-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Perez-Ruiz 1999</LINK>). The trialists reported no between-group difference in the number of acute gout attacks but did not provide data by treatment group. The second trial that included 65 participants, judged to be at unclear risk of bias, reported no between-group difference in the frequency of acute gout attacks at four months (attacks: 0/30 in allopurinol group versus 1/25 in benzbromarone group, RR 0.28, 95% CI 0.01 to 6.58) (<LINK REF="CMP-004.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.1</LINK>) (<LINK REF="STD-Reinders-2009a" TYPE="STUDY">Reinders 2009a</LINK>).</P>

<P>Pooled analysis of withdrawal due to AEs showed no between-group difference between allopurinol and benzbromarone (3/49 in allopurinol group versus 3/42 in benzbromarone group, RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.21 to 3.52) (<LINK REF="CMP-004.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.3</LINK>). Three participants in the allopurinol group withdrew due to skin rashes, while one participant in the benzbromarone group withdrew with dizziness and flushing and another two withdrew after gastrointestinal reactions. One additional person treated with benzbromarone was temporarily taken off of treatment when he developed diarrhoea and was not included in this analysis as benzbromarone was successfully re-started and the AE was determined to be a result of colchicine (<LINK REF="STD-Perez_x002d_Ruiz-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Perez-Ruiz 1999</LINK>).</P>

Two participants in the allopurinol group experienced rash/skin reactions and five participants in the benzbromarone group experienced adverse effects (two with gastrointestinal symptoms, one with an acute gout attack, one with dizziness and flushing, and one with an increase in international normalised ratio) and none was considered serious. In the trial by <LINK REF="STD-Perez_x002d_Ruiz-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Perez-Ruiz 1999</LINK>, one participant died of cardiac failure three months after entering study, and the cause of death was considered to be unrelated to the study medication (and the medication was not specified).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Further safety assessment of allopurinol</HEADING>
<P>From the UK MHRA pharmacovigilance and drug safety updates (<A HREF="http://www.mhra.gov.uk">www.mhra.gov.uk</A>) (accessed 15 January 2014), there were no new drug safety updates with allopurinol. </P>
<P>A search of the EMEA (<A HREF="http://www.emea.europa.eu">www.emea.europa.eu</A>) and Australian Adverse Drug Reactions Bulletin (<A HREF="http://www.tga.gov.au/adr/aadrb.htm">www.tga.gov.au/adr/aadrb.htm</A>) (accessed 15 January 2014), found no reports of SAEs of allopurinol, but did note the potential drug interactions of allopurinol with azathioprine, suggesting avoidance of their use together. The Adverse Drug Reactions Advisory Committee (ADRAC) received 10 reports (since 1980) attributing adverse haematological consequences to this interaction, including one report of a person who died. </P>
<P>Reports from a search of the US FDA MedWatch (<A HREF="http://www.fda.gov/Safety/MedWatch/default.htm">www.fda.gov/Safety/MedWatch/default.htm</A>) (accessed 15 January 2014), reported the incidence of adverse reactions with allopurinol is less than 1%. They reported the most common adverse reaction to allopurinol was skin rash, and recommended treatment be discontinued immediately if a rash develops. In some cases, a skin rash may be followed by more severe hypersensitivity reactions such as exfoliative, urticarial and purpuric lesions as well as Stevens-Johnson syndrome (erythema multiforme exudativum) with or without generalised vasculitis. </P>
<P>An oral desensitisation regimen can be used in people with maculopapular rashes, particularly in people with gout who cannot be treated with uricosurics or other urate-lowering drugs. <LINK REF="REF-Fam-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fam 2001</LINK> performed a retrospective evaluation of an oral desensitisation regimen using gradual dosage-escalation of allopurinol in 32 participants (30 with gout and two with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia) whose treatment was interrupted because of a pruritic cutaneous reaction to the drug. They reported that although pruritic skin eruptions may recur both during and after desensitisation, most of these cutaneous reactions could be managed by temporary withdrawal of allopurinol and dosage adjustment.</P>
<P>The FDA reported on a few cases of reversible clinical hepatotoxicity in people taking allopurinol, and in some people, asymptomatic rises in serum alkaline phosphatase or transaminase have been observed. In people with pre-existing liver disease, periodic liver function tests are recommended during the early stages of treatment with allopurinol.</P>
<P>In cases where allopurinol (300 to 600 mg daily) is administered with mercaptopurine or azathioprine, a reduction in dose to approximately one-third to one-quarter of the usual dose of mercaptopurine or azathioprine should be made, and subsequent dose adjustment made on the basis of therapeutic response and the appearance of toxic effects. The FDA also reported that allopurinol can cause rare irreversible hepatotoxicity and, on occasions, death.</P>

<P>This systematic review analysed the evidence from all published RCT and CCTs of allopurinol in the treatment of chronic gout. We retrieved 11 trials including 4531 participants with chronic gout receiving allopurinol. There were seven RCTs (<LINK REF="STD-Becker-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Becker 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Becker-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Becker 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gibson-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Gibson 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Perez_x002d_Ruiz-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Perez-Ruiz 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Reinders-2009a" TYPE="STUDY">Reinders 2009a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schumacher-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Schumacher 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Taylor-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Taylor 2012</LINK>), and four CCTs (<LINK REF="STD-Bull-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Bull 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rodnan-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Rodnan 1975</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Scott-1966" TYPE="STUDY">Scott 1966</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Singal-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Singal 2011</LINK>). Only one trial was at low risk of bias (<LINK REF="STD-Taylor-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Taylor 2012</LINK>), four at unclear risk of bias (<LINK REF="STD-Becker-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Becker 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Becker-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Becker 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Reinders-2009a" TYPE="STUDY">Reinders 2009a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schumacher-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Schumacher 2008</LINK>), and six trials at high risk of bias (<LINK REF="STD-Bull-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Bull 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gibson-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Gibson 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Perez_x002d_Ruiz-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Perez-Ruiz 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rodnan-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Rodnan 1975</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Scott-1966" TYPE="STUDY">Scott 1966</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Singal-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Singal 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>There was moderate-quality evidence based on one trial (57 participants) of no between-group difference in the rate of new or recurrent gout attacks when allopurinol 300 mg daily was compared with placebo, over a 30-day period, and no between-group difference in reduction of pain when allopurinol was compared with placebo over a 10-day period (<LINK REF="STD-Taylor-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Taylor 2012</LINK>). The trial was the first RCT to our knowledge, that compared allopurinol initiation during an acute attack of gout to delayed initiation (day 11) and has shown no difference in the rate of gout attacks or reduction in pain. There was moderate-quality evidence based on this trial of a significant difference in the proportion of participants achieving a target serum urate level, favouring allopurinol 300 mg daily when compared with placebo over a 30-day period. The NNTB was 1 (95% CI 1.04 to 1.35). There was moderate-quality evidence based on the pooled data of two trials (453 participants) of no between-group difference in the number of participants who withdrew due to AEs or in the number of participants who had SAEs, when allopurinol was compared with placebo over a 28-week period (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>).</P>
<P>There was low-quality evidence based on one small trial (65 participants) of no between-group difference in the incidence of acute gout attacks, when allopurinol up to 300 mg twice daily was compared with benzbromarone up to 200 mg daily over a four-month period. Based on the pooled results of two small trials (102 participants), there was moderate-quality evidence of no between-group difference in the proportion of participants achieving a target serum urate level and low-quality evidence of no between-group difference in the number of participants who withdrew due to AEs when allopurinol was compared with benzbromarone, over a four- to nine-month period (<LINK REF="SOF-03" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 3</LINK>). In view of the small number of participants in these trials, they may have failed to detect a significant difference in these outcomes if one was truly present.</P>
<P>There was low-quality evidence based on pooled data from three trials (1136 participants) of no between-group difference in the incidence of acute gout attacks when allopurinol up to 300 mg daily was compared with febuxostat 80 mg daily over an eight-week period, during which co-administration of flare prophylaxis with naproxen or colchicine was given in two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Becker-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Becker 2005;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Schumacher-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Schumacher 2008</LINK>), and up to a 24-week period (six months) in the third trial (<LINK REF="STD-Singal-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Singal 2011</LINK>), which did not provide flare prophylaxis. There was low-quality evidence based on pooled data of four trials (2618 participants) of a significant difference in the proportion of participants achieving target serum urate level favouring febuxostat 80 mg daily (RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.48 to 0.65; NNTH 4, 95% CI 3 to 5) as the intervention (allopurinol) was less effective at achieving target sUA than the comparator (febuxostat). There was moderate-quality evidence based on the pooled data from three trials (2555 participants) of no between-group difference in the number of participants who withdrew due to AEs of allopurinol up to 300 mg daily versus febuxostat 80 mg daily (<LINK REF="STD-Becker-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Becker 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Becker-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Becker 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schumacher-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Schumacher 2008</LINK>). There was also moderate-quality evidence based on pooled data from these three trials (2556 participants) of no between-group difference in the number of participants with SAEs when allopurinol up to 300 mg daily was compared with febuxostat 80 mg daily over a 24- to 52-week period (<LINK REF="SOF-02" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 2</LINK>). One trial at unclear risk of bias showed no between-group difference in the percentage reduction in tophus area at 52 weeks with 50% for participants on allopurinol 200 or 300 mg daily and 83% for participants on febuxostat 80 mg daily (<LINK REF="STD-Becker-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Becker 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>A further safety assessment on allopurinol was performed by searching the safety registries including the UK MHRA pharmacovigilance and drug safety updates (<A HREF="http://www.mhra.gov.uk">www.mhra.gov.uk</A>), EMEA (<A HREF="http://www.emea.europa.eu">www.emea.europa.eu</A>), Australian Adverse Drug Reactions Bulletin (<A HREF="http://www.tga.gov.au/adr/aadrb.htm">www.tga.gov.au/adr/aadrb.htm</A>) and the US FDA - MedWatch (<A HREF="http://www.fda.gov/Safety/MedWatch/default.htm">www.fda.gov/Safety/MedWatch/default.htm</A>). The FDA reported the incidence of adverse reactions was less than 1%, and that the most common adverse reaction to allopurinol is skin rash, recommending treatment be discontinued immediately if a rash develops. In some cases, a skin rash may be followed by more severe hypersensitivity reactions such as exfoliative, urticarial and purpuric lesions as well as Stevens-Johnson syndrome (erythema multiforme exudativum) or generalised vasculitis or both.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2014-09-08 17:47:27 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson">
<P>We have included 11 published trials (seven RCTs and four CCTs) examining the efficacy and safety of allopurinol in the treatment of chronic gout. Two studies assessed allopurinol versus placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Schumacher-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Schumacher 2008;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Taylor-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Taylor 2012</LINK>), two studies assessed allopurinol versus benzbromarone (<LINK REF="STD-Perez_x002d_Ruiz-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Perez-Ruiz 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Reinders-2009a" TYPE="STUDY">Reinders 2009a</LINK>), while three RCTs and one CCT examined allopurinol versus febuxostat (<LINK REF="STD-Becker-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Becker 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Becker-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Becker 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schumacher-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Schumacher 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Singal-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Singal 2011</LINK>). We summarised these studies in the 'Summary of findings' tables as the most clinically relevant comparisons.</P>
<P>The remaining four trials compared allopurinol with other treatments. One RCT compared allopurinol 200 mg daily plus colchicine 0.5 mg twice daily with colchicine 0.5 mg twice daily alone (<LINK REF="STD-Gibson-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Gibson 1982</LINK>). One open quasi-randomised CCT compared allopurinol 300 to 600 mg daily to probenecid 1 g daily increasing to 2 g daily after two weeks (<LINK REF="STD-Scott-1966" TYPE="STUDY">Scott 1966</LINK>). One quasi-randomised CCT compared two different allopurinol regimens (continuous versus intermittent) (<LINK REF="STD-Bull-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Bull 1989</LINK>). One open cross-over CCT compared allopurinol 300 mg daily with allopurinol 100 mg three times daily (<LINK REF="STD-Rodnan-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Rodnan 1975</LINK>).</P>
<P>Based on the inclusion criteria of these 11 trials (<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>), the results are most relevant to males, aged 50 to 60 years without any significant renal or liver disease. As benzbromarone is not currently available in many countries, there is also a limitation to the applicability of the allopurinol versus benzbromarone data to current practice. However, allopurinol and febuxostat are widely available for use in clinical practice.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2014-09-08 06:42:07 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson">
<P>There was a paucity of high-quality RCTs comparing allopurinol versus placebo, with only two trials assessing this comparison. As there was significant clinical heterogeneity between these trials, we could not pool their efficacy data. One trial judged to be at low risk of bias and of small size (57 participants) was designed to test the hypothesis that there is no difference in pain or the frequency of gout attacks with early versus delayed initiation of allopurinol for an acute attack of gout (<LINK REF="STD-Taylor-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Taylor 2012</LINK>). In doing this, the participants received allopurinol versus placebo for a short 10-day period only (and the total trial duration was 90 days, as colchicine was continued for 90 days). It was the only trial that assessed pain as an outcome, and confirmed the hypothesis relating to pain and acute gout attack frequency over a short period of 10 days. In comparison, another trial was judged to be at unclear risk of bias; however, it was much larger (1072 participants) and had a longer (28 week) duration of follow-up (<LINK REF="STD-Schumacher-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Schumacher 2008</LINK>). There was moderate-quality evidence based on these two trials that allopurinol 100 to 300 mg daily probably does not reduce the number of acute gout attacks or pain, but does increase the proportion achieving target serum urate levels compared with placebo, without increasing withdrawals due to AEs or SAE rates. Further research may change the estimates. There was low-quality evidence that there may be no difference in pain reduction when allopurinol was compared with placebo over a 10-day period (<LINK REF="STD-Taylor-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Taylor 2012</LINK>), and no difference in tophus regression (<LINK REF="STD-Schumacher-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Schumacher 2008</LINK>). However, limited data were reported so further research is likely to change the estimates. Neither trial included an assessment of function or participant global assessment of treatment success.</P>
<P>There was also a paucity of high-quality RCTs comparing allopurinol versus benzbromarone, and we only identified two trials assessing this comparison (<LINK REF="STD-Perez_x002d_Ruiz-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Perez-Ruiz 1999;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Reinders-2009a" TYPE="STUDY">Reinders 2009a</LINK>). These trials were limited by their small size (<LINK REF="STD-Reinders-2009a" TYPE="STUDY">Reinders 2009a</LINK>: 65 participants; <LINK REF="STD-Perez_x002d_Ruiz-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Perez-Ruiz 1999</LINK>: 36 participants). In addition, the study by <LINK REF="STD-Reinders-2009a" TYPE="STUDY">Reinders 2009a</LINK> was limited by the short duration (four months) while the <LINK REF="STD-Perez_x002d_Ruiz-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Perez-Ruiz 1999</LINK> trial had limitations related to the variable duration of follow-up. Neither trial included a placebo arm and both trials were open-label rendering them at risk of performance and detection bias. As both of the allopurinol versus benzbromarone trials were small, there was a risk that they lacked power to detect differences in the outcomes discussed. There was low-quality evidence based on these two trials that allopurinol up to 600 mg daily may not reduce the number of acute gout attacks, and moderate-quality evidence that allopurinol up to 600 mg daily may not increase the proportion of participants achieving target serum urate levels compared with benzbromarone up to 200 mg daily. There may be no difference in the number of withdrawals due to AEs or SAE rates. Further research may change the estimates. Tophus regression was not fully reported and pain, function and participant global assessment of treatment success were not measured.</P>
<P>There was low-quality evidence from three RCTs (<LINK REF="STD-Becker-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Becker 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Becker-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Becker 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schumacher-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Schumacher 2008</LINK>), and one CCT (<LINK REF="STD-Singal-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Singal 2011</LINK>), comparing allopurinol up to 300 mg daily versus febuxostat 80 mg daily, that allopurinol 100 to 300 mg daily may not reduce the number of acute gout attacks, and may be less effective in achieving target serum urate levels compared with febuxostat 80 mg daily, without increasing withdrawals due to AEs or SAE rates. Three studies were at unclear risk (<LINK REF="STD-Becker-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Becker 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Becker-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Becker 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schumacher-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Schumacher 2008</LINK>) and one study at high risk (<LINK REF="STD-Singal-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Singal 2011</LINK>) of performance and detection bias. One trial was at high risk of attrition bias (<LINK REF="STD-Becker-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Becker 2005</LINK>), whereas one trial was at unclear risk of attrition bias (<LINK REF="STD-Singal-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Singal 2011</LINK>), and the other two studies were at low risk of attrition bias (<LINK REF="STD-Becker-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Becker 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schumacher-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Schumacher 2008</LINK>), therefore reducing the overall quality of the evidence. Furthermore, three studies used low dose allopurinol 100 to 300 mg daily (depending on renal function) compared with a reasonable dose of febuxostat 80 mg daily (<LINK REF="STD-Becker-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Becker 2005;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Becker-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Becker 2010;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Schumacher-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Schumacher 2008</LINK>). There was low-quality evidence that there may be no difference in tophus regression between allopurinol up to 300 mg daily and febuxostat 80 mg daily. Further research is likely to change the estimates. None of these trials included an assessment of pain, function or participant global assessment of treatment success.</P>
<P>None of the trials appeared to be limited by indirectness or inconsistency of results. In addition, there did not appear to be a high risk of publication bias.</P>
<P>All other comparisons were supported by small, single studies only, limiting conclusions.</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2014-09-08 01:57:16 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson">
<P>We are confident that the broad literature search used in this review has captured all relevant studies. Two review author independently performed a review of all abstracts and titles as well as data extraction and risk of bias assessment. Consensus was reached after discussing any discrepancies thus minimising bias. We performed a sensitivity analysis where there was concern about risk of bias of an included non-randomised CCT, and this showed no overall difference. The biggest limitation of the review process was the heterogeneity between the trials and the lack of data in a form that could be extracted for meta-analysis. To address more SAEs, we also searched regulatory agency reports.</P>
</POTENTIAL_BIASES>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2014-09-08 06:01:11 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson">
<P>Current guidelines by the British Society for Rheumatology (<LINK REF="REF-Jordan-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jordan 2007</LINK>), ACR (<LINK REF="REF-Khanna-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Khanna 2012</LINK>), and EULAR (<LINK REF="REF-Zhang-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhang 2006</LINK>), recommendations by <LINK REF="REF-Hamburger-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hamburger 2011</LINK>, and the FDA all recommend starting allopurinol at a low dose of 100 mg daily and increasing the dose slowly, every two to five weeks. Our review identified trials where allopurinol doses ranged from 100 to 600 mg daily and highlighted one moderate-quality RCT where a dose of 300 mg daily of allopurinol was compared with placebo and is the first to our knowledge that compared allopurinol initiation during an acute attack of gout to delayed initiation (day 11) and demonstrated no difference in the rate of gout attacks or reduction in pain (<LINK REF="STD-Taylor-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Taylor 2012</LINK>). These findings may begin to change our current clinical practice from delaying the initiation of urate-lowering therapy until after the acute attack has settled, to starting urate-lowering treatment during an acute attack of gout. The ACR gout guidelines suggest that urate-lowering therapy could be started during an acute gout attack, providing that effective acute management is instituted, and these recommendations are based on "consensus opinion of experts, case studies, or standard of care", rather than RCT evidence, as we have shown (<LINK REF="REF-Khanna-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Khanna 2012</LINK>). While the <LINK REF="STD-Taylor-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Taylor 2012 </LINK>trial was published in November 2012, after the ACR guidelines were published, it does support ACR recommendations although it may be underpowered (as it is a small trial with 57 participants) and was of short duration. Therefore, further high-quality RCT evidence assessing early versus delayed initiation of urate lowering therapy would be useful.</P>
<P>The ACR recommends gradual upwards titration of the allopurinol dose every two to five weeks to an appropriate maximum dose for gout, in order to treat to the serum urate target appropriate for the individual participant. The FDA dosing guide lists 200 to 300 mg daily as typical doses for people with mild gout and doses of 400 to 600 mg daily for people with moderately severe tophaceous gout. Allopurinol can be used at doses as high as 800 mg daily to achieve target serum urate level less than 6.0 mg/dL (less than 0.36 mmol/L), although limited safety data were available at these high doses (<LINK REF="REF-Chao-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chao 2009</LINK> <LINK REF="REF-Hamburger-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hamburger 2011</LINK>). Our review did not identify any RCTs or CCTs that used allopurinol in doses as high as 800 mg daily, although one trial titrated the dose to 600 mg daily, which enabled achievement of the target serum urate target level (<LINK REF="STD-Reinders-2009a" TYPE="STUDY">Reinders 2009a</LINK>).</P>
<P>Our review did not identify any RCTs that compared allopurinol with probenecid in chronic gout, although did retrieve one CCT at high risk of bias where limited data were presented (<LINK REF="STD-Scott-1966" TYPE="STUDY">Scott 1966</LINK>). The EULAR guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-Zhang-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhang 2006</LINK>) and gout recommendations by <LINK REF="REF-Hamburger-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hamburger 2011</LINK> suggest a role for probenecid, a uricosuric agent, as an alternative to allopurinol, based on data from uncontrolled trials (e.g. <LINK REF="STD-Reinders-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Reinders 2007;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Stocker-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Stocker 2011</LINK>), which we excluded.</P>
<P>In contrast to our review that separately compared allopurinol 100 to 300 mg daily with different doses of febuxostat (40, 80, 120 and 240 mg daily), one systematic review pooled data comparing allopurinol 100 to 300 mg daily with different daily doses of febuxostat (40, 80, 120 and 240 mg daily) into a single meta-analysis (<LINK REF="REF-Faruque-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Faruque 2013</LINK>). They reported that participants on febuxostat (all doses combined) were more likely to have a gout attack when compared with allopurinol 100 to 300 mg daily (RR 1.16, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.31), and more likely to achieve target serum urate level (RR 1.56, 95% CI 1.22 to 2.0). This is consistent with our results comparing allopurinol with febuxostat 120 and 240 mg for acute gout attacks and our results comparing allopurinol with febuxostat 80, 120 and 240 mg for achieving the target serum urate. However, we found no between-group differences between allopurinol up to 300 mg daily and febuxostat 80 mg daily with respect to acute gout attacks and no between-group differences between allopurinol 200 or 300 mg daily and febuxostat 40 mg daily with respect to serum urate normalisation. Both reviews reported similar safety data.</P>
<P>In contrast to our review, <LINK REF="REF-Faruque-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Faruque 2013</LINK> included two trials with mixed populations of people with hyperuricaemia and chronic gout (<LINK REF="STD-Kamatani-2011a" TYPE="STUDY">Kamatani 2011a</LINK> (S13-18); <LINK REF="STD-Kamatani-2011b" TYPE="STUDY">Kamatani 2011b</LINK> (S44-S49); and excluded <LINK REF="STD-Singal-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Singal 2011</LINK> from their review due to methodological limitations. While we recognised that <LINK REF="STD-Singal-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Singal 2011</LINK> was at high risk of bias, a sensitivity analysis excluding this trial did not alter our results for acute gout attack frequency, proportion of participants achieving target serum urate and total AEs.</P>

<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2014-09-08 06:42:59 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2014-09-08 06:42:59 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson">
<P>Allopurinol is widely considered a safe and effective urate-lowering therapy used to treat chronic gout. However, our review highlights the relatively limited availability of high-quality randomised controlled trial (RCT) evidence to support this view.</P>
<P>Chronic gout results from the deposition of monosodium urate (uric acid crystals) from supersaturated body fluids and its manifestations include arthritis, tophi, uric acid urolithiasis and nephropathy. Urate-lowering therapy reduces serum urate concentrations to subsaturating levels preventing the formation and deposition of urate crystals and consequently reduces the long-term manifestations of chronic gout. However, the initiation of urate-lowering therapy has been associated with an increased incidence of acute gout attacks and, therefore, flare prophylaxis (with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or colchicine) during this period is recommended.</P>
<P>Allopurinol 300 mg daily probably does not reduce the incidence of acute gout attacks when compared with placebo over 30 days, and allopurinol 100 to 600 mg daily may not reduce acute gout attacks compared with benzbromarone 100 to 200 mg daily or febuxostat 80 mg daily over 16 to 24 weeks. While this review shows there may be similar effects when allopurinol was compared with benzbromarone for serum urate normalisation (moderate-quality evidence), it does provide moderate-quality evidence from one trial (57 participants) that allopurinol is probably more effective than placebo, and low-quality evidence based on four studies (2618 participants) that allopurinol 100 to 300 mg daily may be less effective than febuxostat 80 mg daily in achieving a target serum urate level at 24 to 52 weeks. Single studies reported no difference in pain reduction when allopurinol 300 mg daily was compared with placebo over 10 days, and no difference in tophus regression when allopurinol 200 to 300 mg daily was compared with febuxostat 80 mg daily. None of the trials reported on other outcomes of interest including function, health-related quality of life or participant global assessment of treatment success, where further research would be useful for clinical practice.</P>
<P>Our review found low- to moderate-quality evidence indicating similar effects on withdrawals due to adverse events or serious adverse events when allopurinol 100 to 600 mg daily was compared with placebo, benzbromarone 100 to 200 mg daily or febuxostat 80 mg daily. We did not identify any major new concerns regarding safety of allopurinol based on alerts from regulatory bodies. The most common adverse reaction with allopurinol was reported to be skin rash.</P>
<P>We downgraded the evidence due to limitations in study design indicating potential bias, and possible imprecision.</P>
<P>All other comparisons (allopurinol versus colchicine, allopurinol versus probenecid, continuous versus intermittent allopurinol and different doses of allopurinol) were supported by small, single studies only, limiting conclusions.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2014-09-08 04:54:18 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson">
<P>Due to the paucity of high-quality RCT evidence comparing allopurinol initiation during an acute attack of gout with delayed initiation and potentially significant cost implications in changing our current practice, future trials assessing this would be beneficial for clinical practice. Future trials of allopurinol versus other urate-lowering drugs should report on the method of randomisation and treatment allocation concealment, blinding of study participants, study personnel and outcome assessment, follow-up of all participants who entered the trial and complete reporting of outcomes. To enable comparison and pooling of the results of RCTs, we suggest that future trials report means with SDs for continuous measures and number of events and total numbers analysed for dichotomous measures, and assess outcomes recommended by OMERACT (Outcome Measures in Rheumatology) for studies of acute gout, including pain, joint swelling, joint tenderness, participant global assessment and activity limitations (<LINK REF="REF-Schumacher-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schumacher 2009</LINK>).</P>

<P>We clarified that we excluded mixed populations in the review; included search of registries for serious adverse effects and specified the other sources of bias we looked for: whether there was a carry-over effect from previous therapies, whether appropriate co-intervention (e.g. colchicine or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) were administered and whether any pre-administered interventions could diminish the effect of the subsequent randomised intervention.</P>
<P>We replaced the primary and secondary outcomes by a list of major outcomes (i.e. those presented in the 'Summary of findings' tables) in the review. This was done to implement GRADE and the use of 'Summary of findings' tables.</P>

<P>Comment: As a chronic gout sufferer who swears by allopurinol which I have taken on a long term basis I found the study on allopurinol fascinating in its conclusions...<BR/>
<BR/>The evidence:<BR/>"- 8 people out of 100 had an acute gout attack with allopurinol.<BR/>
<BR/>- 12 people out of 100 had an acute gout attack with placebo."<BR/>
<BR/>The conclusion:<BR/>
<BR/>"moderate-quality evidence indicated that, compared with placebo, allopurinol (100 to 300 mg daily) probably does not reduce the number of acute gout attacks, "<BR/>
<BR/>My verdict harking back to being a statistician in my youth is that they werent asking the right questions! Instead of asking whether you had an attack of gout during the study period, it should have been "HOW MANY attacks did you have over the study period?" I suspect people taking allopurinol get far fewer attacks. That is certainly the case with me. I am not sure the duration of the study was sufficient either.<BR/>
<BR/>With the group who took the allopurinol, I would also ask whether they were likely to continue with the allopurinol after the end of the study!<BR/>
<BR/>In other words, the conclusion drawn by the study is I believe misleading, as in my opinion Allopurinol SIGNIFICANTLY reduces the frequency and severity of attacks. Remember that the other conclusion is that the blood serum level targets were reached in 25/26 partiicpants, with 0 in placebo, which is a pretty compelling statistic I would have thought.</P>

<P>Thank you for your feedback.</P>
<P>The trial from which we calculated the outcome, new or recurrent gout attacks, is a measure of the how many new or recurrent gout attacks the participants reported over the study treatment period (of 30 days). The frequency of new or recurrent gout attacks that we calculated from this study was: 2/26 (7.7%, or 8/100) in allopurinol group versus 3/25 (12%, or 12/100) in the placebo group.<BR/>
<BR/>It is interesting that the large difference in people achieving an ideal serum urate concentration with allopurinol treatment compared to placebo did not necessarily translate to a difference in gout attacks following treatment. We suggest that blood urate level is not the most relevant outcome measure, it is really an interim measure, and we are not sure if it is predictive of the number of gout attacks.<BR/>
<BR/>We are not sure if the outcome (or question asked of participants) was the incorrect one, or if the study was just too small to give us a result we could have more confidence in. </P>
<P>A second trial also reported no between-group difference in the proportion of participants requiring treatment for gout flares in the first eight weeks of the trial: 61/268 (23%) in allopurinol group versus 27/134 (20%) in placebo group. It is possible these results were influenced by the co-administration of naproxen or colchicine.</P>
