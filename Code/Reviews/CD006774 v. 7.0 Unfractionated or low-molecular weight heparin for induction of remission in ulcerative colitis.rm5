<TITLE>Unfractionated or low molecular weight heparin for treatment of active ulcerative colitis</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2015-08-04 12:27:45 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="John K MacDonald">
<P>
<B>Review Question</B>
</P>
<P>We reviewed the evidence about the effects of unfractionated or low-molecular weight heparin on induction of remission in patients with ulcerative colitis, with the medical literature up to June 17, 2014.</P>
<P>
<B>Background </B>
</P>
<P>What is ulcerative colitis?</P>
<P>Ulcerative colitis is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease characterized by recurrent episodes of active disease, which commonly affect the rectum or colon or both. Patients with active disease may experience abdominal cramping, urgency to pass stools, and bloody diarrhea. When the symptoms stop, the patients enter a 'remission phase' of ulcerative colitis.</P>
<P>What is heparin?</P>
<P>Heparin is a family of medications that reduce the body's natural ability to form clots. Unfrationated and low-molecular heparins are sub-types of heparins that are currently available for clinical use. In theory, decreasing clot formation may help to improve symptoms of ulcerative colitis.</P>
<P>
<B>Study Characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>The researchers identified five studies that included a total of 329 patients. Three studies (270 patients) compared low molecular weight heparin to placebo (e.g. a sugar pill), one study (34 patients) compared low molecular weight heparin in addition to standard therapy, and one study (25 patients) compared unfractionated heparin to steroids. The study comparing unfractionated heparin to steroids and the study that compared the addition of low molecular weight heparin to standard therapy to standard therapy alone was judged to be of low quality. The three placebo-controlled studies were judged to be of high quality. </P>
<P>
<B>Key Results </B>
</P>
<P>In one small study, unfractionated heparin was worse than steroids for inducing clinical improvement (i.e. reduction of symptoms) in people with severe ulcerative colitis. In addition, rectal bleeding was more frequent among people who received unfractionated heparin. In another small study low molecular weight heparin used with standard therapy provided no additional benefit over standard therapy alone in adults with active ulcerative colitis. </P>
<P>Low molecular weight heparin administered by injection showed no benefit over placebo for any outcome, including clinical remission (very low quality of evidence), clinical improvement and endoscopic improvement (i.e. healing of inflammation). High dose low molecular weight heparin administered via an extended colon-release tablet demonstrated benefit over placebo for clinical remission, clinical improvement. and endoscopic improvement. This result suggests that high dose low molecular weight heparin administered by extended-release capsules may be effective for the treatment of active ulcerative colitis. However, this result needs to be verified by future clinical trials.</P>

<ABSTRACT MODIFIED="2015-08-04 12:27:26 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="John K MacDonald">
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>There are a limited number of treatment options for patients with ulcerative colitis (UC). An increased risk of thrombosis in UC coupled with an observation that UC patients being treated with anticoagulant therapy for thrombotic events had an improvement in their bowel symptoms led to trials examining the use of unfractionated heparin (UFH) and low molecular weight heparins (LMWH) in patients with active UC.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To review randomized trials examining the efficacy of unfractionated heparin (UFH) or low molecular weight heparins (LMWH) for remission induction in patients with ulcerative colitis.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2015-08-04 12:27:10 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="John K MacDonald">
<P>We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL, and the Cochrane IBD/FBD group specialized trials register up to June 2014. We also searched review papers on ulcerative colitis and references from identified papers in an effort to identify additional randomized trials studying UFH or LMWH use in patients with ulcerative colitis. We searched abstracts from major gastroenterological meetings to identify research published in abstract form.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2015-08-04 12:27:12 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="John K MacDonald">
<P>Randomized controlled trials comparing UFH or LMWH to placebo or a control therapy for induction of remission in ulcerative colitis were included. Studies published in abstract form only were included if the authors could be contacted for further information.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2015-08-04 12:27:20 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="John K MacDonald">
<P>A data extraction form was developed and used to extract data from included studies. Two authors independently extracted data. Any disagreements were resolved by consensus. The Cochrane Risk of Bias tool was used to assess study quality. Data were analyzed on an intention-to-treat basis. The primary outcome was induction of remission, as defined by the studies. Secondary outcomes measures included: endoscopic remission as defined by the authors; clinical, histological or endoscopic improvement as defined by the authors; the occurrence of adverse events; the occurrence of bleeding; and improvements in quality of life as measured by a validated instrument. We calculated the risk ratio (RR) and corresponding 95% confidence interval for dichotomous outcomes. Data were combined for analysis if they assessed the same treatments (UFH or LMWH versus placebo or other therapy). The overall quality of the evidence supporting the outcomes was evaluated using the GRADE criteria.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-08-04 12:27:26 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="John K MacDonald">
<P>Five studies were eligible for inclusion (329 patients). Three studies (270 patients) compared low molecular weight heparin to placebo, one study (34 patients) compared LMWH in addition to standard therapy, and one study (25 patients) compared UFH to corticosteroids. The study comparing UFH to corticosteroids was rated at high risk of bias due to a single-blind design. The study that compared the addition of LMWH to standard therapy to standard therapy alone was rated at high risk of bias due to open-label design. The other three studies were rated as low risk of bias. LMWH administered subcutaneously showed no benefit over placebo for any outcome, including clinical remission (very low quality of evidence), and clinical, endoscopic, or histological improvement. High dose LMWH administered via an extended colon-release tablet demonstrated benefit over placebo for clinical remission (RR 1.39; 95% CI 1.09 to 1.77 ; P = 0.008; very low quality of evidence), clinical improvement (RR 1.28; 95% CI 1.06 to 1.55; P = 0.01; very low quality of evidence), and endoscopic improvement (RR 1.21; 95% CI 1.00 to 1.47 ; P = 0.05) but not endoscopic remission or histologic improvement. LMWH was not beneficial when added to standard therapy for clinical remission, clinical improvement, endoscopic remission or endoscopic improvement. LMWH was well-tolerated but provided no significant benefit for quality of life. One study examining UFH versus corticosteroids for the treatment of severe UC demonstrated the inferiority of UFH for clinical improvement. More patients assigned to UFH had rectal hemorrhage as an adverse event.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2010-09-01 12:49:12 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="John K MacDonald">
<P>There is evidence to suggest that LMWH may be effective for the treatment of active UC. When administered by extended colon-release tablets, LMWH was more effective than placebo for treating outpatients with mild to moderate disease. This benefit needs to be confirmed by further randomized controlled studies. The same benefits were not seen when LMWH was administered subcutaneously at lower doses. There is no evidence to support the use of UFH for the treatment of active UC. A further trial of UFH in patients with mild disease may also be justified. Any benefit found would need to be weighed against a possible increased risk of rectal bleeding in patients with active UC.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2015-08-04 12:27:47 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="John K MacDonald">
<P>Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease with a relatively limited number of treatment options. Traditional therapies include 5-aminosalicylates and corticosteroids. Azathioprine is effective for maintenance of remission of quiescent disease (<LINK REF="REF-Timmer-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Timmer 2012</LINK>), but its effectiveness for remission induction in patients with active disease is questionable (<LINK REF="REF-Ardizzone-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ardizzone 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hawthorne-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hawthorne 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jewell-1974" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jewell 1974</LINK>). Infliximab is effective for induction and maintenance of remission in patients who have failed or not tolerated other therapies (<LINK REF="REF-Lawson-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lawson 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rutgeerts-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rutgeerts 2005</LINK>). Cyclosporine may be effective for treating patients with severe disease, but with significant potential for toxicity (<LINK REF="REF-Shibolet-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shibolet 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>There is an increased risk of thrombosis in patients with ulcerative colitis (<LINK REF="REF-Bernstein-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bernstein 2001</LINK>). This may be due to an association with underlying coagulopathies (<LINK REF="REF-Hudson-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hudson 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Souto-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Souto 1995</LINK>). Microthrombosis may also play a role in the pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis (<LINK REF="REF-Dhillon-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dhillon 1992</LINK>). The finding of an improvement in bowel symptoms in ulcerative colitis patients treated with unfractionated heparin for acute thrombotic events led to hypotheses about the role of thrombosis in the pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis (<LINK REF="STD-Zavgorodnii-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Zavgorodnii 1982</LINK>). Subsequently, the potential role of unfractionated heparin and low molecular weight heparins in the treatment of patients with active ulcerative colitis was investigated. However, if a benefit were to be found, it would need to be balanced against the potential for worsening of rectal bleeding in patients with active ulcerative colitis treated with anticoagulants. This systematic review is an update of a previously published Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-Chande-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chande 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Chande-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chande 2010</LINK>).</P>

</SEARCH_METHODS>
<DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2015-07-29 11:39:53 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="John K MacDonald">
<P>Study selection<BR/>Each author independently reviewed potentially relevant trials to determine their eligibility for inclusion based on the criteria identified above. Studies published in abstract form only were included if the authors could be contacted for further information.</P>
<P>Data collection<BR/>A data extraction form was developed and used to extract data from included studies. At least 2 authors independently extracted data. Any disagreements were resolved by consensus.</P>
<P>Statistical analysis<BR/>Data were analyzed using Review Manager (RevMan 5.3.5). Data were analyzed on an intention-to-treat basis, and treated dichotomously. In cross-over studies, only data from the first arm were included. The primary endpoint was induction of remission, as defined by the studies. Data were combined for analysis if they assessed the same treatments (UFH or LMWH versus placebo or other therapy). If a comparison was only assessed in a single trial, P-values were derived using the chi-square test. If the comparison was assessed in more than one trial, summary test statistics were derived using the Peto risk ratio and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). The presence of heterogeneity among studies was assessed using the chi-square test (a P value of 0.10 was regarded as statistically significant). If statistically significant heterogeneity was identified the risk ratio and 95% CI were calculated using a random effects model.</P>
<P>Quality assessment<BR/>All authors independently assessed the risk of bias as described in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). Factors assessed included:</P>
<OL>
<LI>sequence generation (i.e. was the allocation sequence adequately generated?);</LI>
<LI>allocation sequence concealment (i.e. was allocation adequately concealed?);</LI>
<LI>blinding (i.e. was knowledge of the allocated intervention adequately prevented during the study?);</LI>
<LI>incomplete outcome data (i.e. were incomplete outcome data adequately addressed?);</LI>
<LI>selective outcome reporting (i.e. are reports of the study free of suggestion of selective outcome reporting?); and </LI>
<LI>other potential sources of bias (i.e. was the study apparently free of other problems that could put it at a high risk of bias?).</LI>
</OL>
<P>A judgement of 'Yes' indicates low risk of bias, 'No' indicates high risk of bias, and 'Unclear' indicates unclear or unknown risk of bias. Disagreements were resolved by consensus. Study authors were contacted when insufficient information was provided to determine risk of bias. The overall quality of the evidence supporting the outcomes was evaluated using the GRADE criteria. </P>

<LINK REF="STD-Bloom-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Bloom 2004</LINK>
<BR/>This randomized, double-blind trial included 100 patients (48 male, 52 female) with active ulcerative colitis. Active disease was defined by a clinical assessment of disease flare-up and a minimum score of three on a combined score of bowel frequency, rectal bleeding, and procto-sigmoidoscopy as defined in the paper. A histology score was added where available to give a baseline colitis activity score. The patients were randomized to subcutaneous tinzaparin 175 anti-Xa IU/kg/day for two weeks, followed by subcutaneous tinzaparin 4500 anti-Xa IU/day sc for four weeks (n = 48) or placebo (n = 52) subcutaneous injection daily for six weeks. Concurrent treatment with stable doses of salicylates or without improvement from increasing doses of salicylates was allowed, but no other therapies for ulcerative colitis were permitted. Patients underwent a sigmoidoscopy with biopsies within four days prior to randomization as well as within two to seven days after the end of the 42 days of treatment. The primary outcome measure was the degree of clinical improvement based on a change in the colitis activity score at the end of therapy compared to the baseline score. Complete response was defined as a colitis activity score of zero whereas a partial response was defined as a reduction of three points or more. Other outcome measures included numbers and percentages of patients in each category of activity score, quality of life scores using the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (IBDQ) (completed by patients in English speaking countries only), compliance with therapy, and adverse events.</P>

<BR/>This double-blind, randomized trial included 141 patients (73 male, 68 female) with mild to moderately active left-sided ulcerative colitis (defined by authors as a CAI &#8805;5 and &#8804; 12) receiving stable-dose oral aminosalicylate therapy. Patients were randomized to receive either an extended-release 210 mg parnaparin sodium (87-91 anti-Xa U/mg) tablet that targets the colon or an identical placebo tablet every day for eight weeks while continuing their existing aminosalicylate regimens. Each patient underwent a colonoscopy, histologic evaluation and clinical assessment using the Clinical Activity Index (<LINK REF="REF-Rachmilewitz-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rachmilewitz 1989</LINK>) (CAI) no earlier than two weeks prior to entry. Clinical response was also measured at two, four and eight weeks with a second colonoscopy and histologic evaluation performed at the end of treatment. The primary outcome measure was clinical remission (CAI &lt;4) after eight weeks of treatment. Secondary outcome measures included clinical improvement (decrease in CAI by &#8805; 2), endoscopic healing and improvement, histologic improvement, bleeding, and adverse events.</P>

<BR/>This double-blind, randomized trial included 29 patients (16 male, 13 female) with mild to moderately active ulcerative colitis (diagnosis based on Lennard-Jones criteria) and a Truelove classification severity score of 4 to 14 were included. The patients were randomized to reviparin 3436 IU (n = 15) or placebo (n = 14) subcutaneous injections twice daily for up to eight weeks. All patients were concurrently treated with comparable stable doses of salicylates. Patients underwent a sigmoidoscopy with biopsies at baseline and after eight weeks, and were seen regularly during the eight week study period. A Clinical Symptom Grading and Colitis Activity Index (<LINK REF="REF-Lichtiger-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lichtiger 1994</LINK>) was calculated at each visit (<LINK REF="REF-Lichtiger-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lichtiger 1994</LINK>). If there was no improvement after four weeks or a clinical regression at any study visit the treatment was discontinued and corticosteroid therapy was initiated. The primary outcome measure was clinical improvement at the end of eight weeks where improvement was defined as a reduction in CAI by six points compared to baseline. Secondary outcomes included endoscopic and histologic improvements, and quality of life based on the IBDQ.</P>

<BR/>This randomized non-blinded trial included 34 patients (22 male, 12 female) with active ulcerative colitis (including 6 patients hospitalized at time of enrollment). Patients were randomized to two groups. The standard therapy group received corticosteroids and aminosalicylates (n = 18). The heparin therapy group received similar standard therapy plus subcutaneous enoxaparin 100 anti-Xa IU/kg daily for 12 weeks (n = 16). For all patients the corticosteroids were initially administered either intravenously (prednisolone 50 to 75 mg/day) or orally (methylprednisolone 32 to 48 mg/day) depending on disease severity. After initial response, IV corticosteroids were switched to oral, and oral corticosteroids were tapered in a dose-reduction schedule over 12 weeks. Aminosalicylates were given in steady doses (2 to 4 g/day) throughout the study. Patients underwent a colonoscopy at baseline, and were seen at regular intervals for clinical and biochemical assessments during the 12 week study period. Another colonoscopy was performed at the end of 12 weeks. Disease activity was assessed clinically with the Simple Clinical Colitis Activity Index (SCCAI) at each study visit. Endoscopic disease severity was assessed with a modified endoscopic grading system (scored 0 to 18). Histologic disease activity was scored from 0 to 12 based on four features (ulcers, erosion, crypt abscess, cryptitis). The primary outcome measures were the percentages of patients with complete responses (coexisting clinical and endoscopic remission, with SCCAI score <U>&lt;</U> 2 and endoscopic score <U>&lt;</U> 3) and partial responses (<U>&gt;</U> 50% reduction of SCCAI score and a reduction in endoscopic score by at least 1 grade) after 12 weeks of therapy in the "heparin therapy group" compared to the "standard therapy group". Other outcome measures included compliance and tolerability to therapy, withdrawals, adverse events, change in clinical, endoscopic, and histological disease activities and laboratory parameters of inflammation and coagulation.</P>

<BR/>This single-blind, randomized trial included 25 patients (12 male, 13 female) with moderate to severely active ulcerative colitis requiring hospitalization, with a Seo activity index of at least 150, and a sigmoidoscopic score of at least 2 on a 0 to 3 scale. Patients were stratified into moderate disease (Seo index 150 to 220) and severe disease (Seo index &gt; 220). Patients were randomized to a continuous infusion of UFH (n = 12; adjusted to achieve a prolongation of activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) of 1.5 to 2 times control)) or a single daily dose of 6-methylprednisolone 0.75 mg/kg/day (moderate disease) or 1 mg/kg/day (severe disease) plus a placebo infusion (n = 13). Physician assessors were blinded to the assigned therapies. Patients with significant improvement (decrease in Seo index &gt; 70 points) or remission (Seo index &lt; 100) were discharged from hospital on 12500 U of UFH twice daily or a tapering dose of steroids until week 12 of the study. Patients were seen regularly during hospital admission and after discharge. A sigmoidoscopy was performed at baseline, and at weeks four and eight. The primary outcome measure was clinical improvement (decrease in Seo index &gt; 70 points) at day 10. Patients not achieving this outcome or with a clinical worsening (increase in Seo index &gt; 70 points) at any point were considered treatment failures and withdrawn from the study. Secondary outcome measures included amount of rectal bleeding and changes in inflammatory markers on serial serology.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2015-08-04 12:28:37 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="John K MacDonald">
<P>There are a limited number of effective treatments for remission induction in active UC. An increased risk of thrombosis in patients with UC and reports suggesting an improvement in UC symptoms while on anticoagulant therapy led to randomized controlled studies of heparin and LMWH in active UC. However, an increased risk of rectal bleeding due to anticoagulant therapy would need to be considered as a potential complication of treatment, and balanced against any therapeutic benefit.</P>
<P>There are four manuscripts reporting three distinct randomized, placebo-controlled double blind studies evaluating LMWH in the treatment of outpatients with mild-moderate active UC (<LINK REF="STD-Bloom-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Bloom 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Celasco-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Celasco 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-de-Bievre-2007" TYPE="STUDY">de Bievre 2007</LINK>; Vrij 2007). Two of these studies showed no benefit for adjuvant LMWH therapy over placebo in a variety of outcome measures, including clinical remission, clinical improvement, endoscopic improvement, histological improvement, or quality of life (<LINK REF="STD-Bloom-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Bloom 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-de-Bievre-2007" TYPE="STUDY">de Bievre 2007</LINK>). However, the results of the <LINK REF="STD-Celasco-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Celasco 2010</LINK> showed statistically significant benefit for LMWH over placebo in achieving clinical remission and improvement, endoscopic improvement, and reduced rectal bleeding when administered by extended colon -release tablets.</P>
<P>The benefit of LMWH described by <LINK REF="STD-Celasco-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Celasco 2010</LINK> may be due to the investigators' decision to study a LMWH administered via extended colon-release tablets rather than through the conventional subcutaneous route. Oral LMWH is absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract , has enhanced efficacy in targeting GI lesions, and exerts a weaker systemic antithrombotic effect (<LINK REF="REF-Lever-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lever 2002</LINK>). Taken together, these factors allowed <LINK REF="STD-Celasco-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Celasco 2010</LINK> to administer a much higher dose of LMWH with a decreased risk of bleeding (18,000-19,000 anti-Xa IU versus 4500 anti-Xa IU <LINK REF="STD-Bloom-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Bloom 2004</LINK> versus 3436 anti-Xa IU <LINK REF="STD-de-Bievre-2007" TYPE="STUDY">de Bievre 2007</LINK>) and deliver the drug directly to the diseased colon rather than have the drug systemically distributed to unaffected tissues.</P>
<P>The two studies with negative findings enrolled relatively small numbers of patients, and may have lacked the power to detect a statistically significant difference between LMWH and placebo. However, the large difference in effect size between these studies weakens this hypothesis. Lastly, but of note, five of the eight <LINK REF="STD-Celasco-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Celasco 2010</LINK> investigators worked as consultants or employees for the firm that provided all study funding and developed the extended colon-release technology. Despite being a well-designed trial with thorough outcome reporting and analysis, the heavy degree of industry involvement is a potential source of bias which weakens the conclusions one can draw from the study. Empirical research has demonstrated that industry funded studies are more likely to be associated with positive results for the products made by the company funding the research (<LINK REF="REF-Bhandari-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bhandari 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lexchin-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lexchin 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>No benefit was found with the addition of LMWH to standard therapy in <LINK REF="STD-Zezos-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Zezos 2006</LINK>, in which participants and evaluators were not blinded to treatment allocation. However, LMWH was well-tolerated in all of these studies, without any reports of significant rectal bleeding in those patients assigned to LMWH. Two other placebo-controlled studies published as abstracts only also demonstrated no benefit for LMWH over placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Korzenik-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Korzenik 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Torkvist-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Torkvist 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>Only one of the included studies evaluated UFH monotherapy for active ulcerative colitis (<LINK REF="STD-Panes-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Panes 2000</LINK>). This study included inpatients with severe disease, and corticosteroids were used as the comparator. The UFH-treated patients had a significantly lower rate of clinical improvement than those who received steroids (0% versus 69%). Increased rectal bleeding also occurred in 3 of 12 patients given UFH. Although this study was limited by its single-blind design, in that only the physician examiners were blinded to treatment allocation, the results strongly suggest inferiority of UFH compared to corticosteroids in this patient population. Furthermore, this study shows that UFH used as monotherapy does not provide any benefit for the treatment of moderate or severe exacerbations of ulcerative colitis. Whether or not UFH would be effective for treating patients with milder disease is not known. A single randomized, placebo-controlled trial testing UFH in this setting has been published in abstract form only (<LINK REF="STD-Korzenik-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Korzenik 1999</LINK>), but the final results have not been published.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2010-09-01 12:55:26 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="John K MacDonald">
<P>There is evidence to suggest that LMWH may be effective for the treatment of active UC. When administered by extended colon-release tablets, LMWH was more effective than placebo for treating outpatients with mild to moderate disease. This benefit needs to be confirmed with further randomized controlled trials by independent researchers with minimal industry involvement. The same benefits were not seen when LMWH was administered subcutaneously at lower doses. UFH is inferior to corticosteroids for treating patients with moderate or severe disease and does not lead to clinical improvement in these patients. Whether or not UFH would be effective for treating patients with milder disease is uncertain, although the potential for worsening rectal bleeding may be significant.</P>

The possibility that microthrombosis plays a role in the pathogenesis of UC led to trials examining the use of UFH and LMWH for the treatment of UC (<LINK REF="REF-Dhillon-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dhillon 1992</LINK>). These trials have demonstrated therapeutic benefit of LMWH administered via oral extended colon-release tablets, but not through the subcutaneous route. Further studies of the therapeutic efficacy of oral heparin formulations in active UC may be warranted. The efficacy of rectally administered LMWH (i.e. enema) has not been studied and should also be investigated (<LINK REF="REF-Luo-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Luo 2010</LINK>). The utility of UFH in mild disease has been studied, but the final results are not known (<LINK REF="STD-Korzenik-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Korzenik 1999</LINK>). The pathophysiology of UC and the possible link between microthrombosis and immune activation in the colon should be further investigated. Other therapeutic targets may be identified which could be important in developing novel treatments for UC.</P>
