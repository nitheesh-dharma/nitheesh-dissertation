<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2008-10-20 15:26:13 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Cathy Bennett">
<P>Toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN or Lyell's disease) is a rare life-threatening skin condition. It is probably an immune response triggered by some drugs or infection, which is more likely to happen in people with suppressed immunity. TEN causes extensive blistering and shedding of skin, similar to burns. Drugs used include oral steroids, thalidomide, immunosuppressants and immunoglobulins. This review of trials did not find any reliable evidence for the treatment of TEN. The only trial available used thalidomide, but this trial did not show any benefit from treatment compared against placebo but highlighted increased chances of dying from the treatment. Thalidomide is not safe or effective for the skin condition toxic epidermal necrolysis, but there is not enough evidence to show which treatments are effective.</P>

<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To assess the effects of all interventions for the treatment of toxic epidermal necrolysis.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>We searched the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register (March 2001), the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (March 2001), MEDLINE (1966 to December 2001), EMBASE (1980 to December 2001), DARE (4th Quarter 2001) and CINAHL (1982 to October 2001).</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2008-10-22 09:42:54 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Diane A  Horsley">
<P>Only one randomised controlled trial of treatment was identified. This trial compared the effectiveness of thalidomide with placebo and included 22 patients, 12 in the treatment group and 10 in the placebo group. Patients on the treatment arm received thalidomide 200 mg twice daily for 5 days. The main end point was the measurement of the progression of skin detachment after seven days. Other end points were the overall mortality and severity of the disease evaluated with the simplified acute physiology score. The study was terminated as the mortality on the treatment arm was 83% compared to 30% on the control arm (relative risk 2.78, 95% confidence interval 1.04 to 7.40).<BR/>No randomised controlled trials of the most commonly used current treatments i.e. systemic steroids, cyclosporin A and intravenous immunoglobulins were found.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>Treatment with thalidomide was not shown to be effective and was associated with significantly higher mortality than placebo. There is no reliable evidence on which to base treatment for toxic epidermal necrolysis, a disease commonly associated with mortality rates of around 30%. More research is required to understand the mechanisms of toxic epidermal necrolysis. International multi-centre studies are needed in the form of randomised controlled trials, to evaluate treatments for toxic epidermal necrolysis, especially those using high doses of steroid and intravenous immunoglobulins.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Definition</HEADING>
<P>Toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) is a rare dermatological condition of sudden onset characterised by extensive blistering and shedding of the skin. It is usually associated with high morbidity and mortality (<LINK REF="REF-Dolan-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dolan 1989</LINK>). This condition is also known as Lyell's disease after Alan Lyell who first described it in four patients and coined the term TEN (<LINK REF="REF-Lyell-1956" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lyell 1956</LINK>).</P>
<P>The terminology of severe skin reactions such as TEN, Steven-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and erythema multiforme majus (EEMM) has been confusing. Some specialists in this field believe that EEMM has to be separated from SJS and TEN not only clinically but also etiologically (<LINK REF="REF-Assier-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Assier 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mockenhaupt-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mockenhaupt 1999</LINK>). Furthermore, they believe that SJS and TEN represent a continuous spectrum of the same disease, i.e. one disorder of different severity (<LINK REF="REF-Revuz-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Revuz 1996</LINK>). A consensus definition has been developed by an international group of dermatologists, which has been used successfully in several epidemiological studies (<LINK REF="REF-Bastuji_x002d_Garin-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bastuji-Garin 1993</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Epidemiology</HEADING>
<P>TEN is a rare condition. The annual reported incidence of TEN, SJS and TEN/SJS overlap is 1.89 cases per million population (<LINK REF="REF-Mockenhaupt-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mockenhaupt 1996</LINK>). The incidence of SJS is probably higher than TEN (<LINK REF="REF-Roujeau-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roujeau 1995</LINK>). The incidence of TEN may be greater in the elderly population, which could be due to their relative over-exposure to medication. There is some predisposition to TEN among patients with systemic lupus erythematosus, HIV/AIDS and recipients of bone marrow transplants. The reported mortality in TEN is around 30% (Kelly 1995) but can be as high as 45% when there is skin detachment of more than 30% (<LINK REF="REF-Mockenhaupt-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mockenhaupt 1996</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Causes and mechanisms of action</HEADING>
<P>The cause of TEN is far from clear although hypersensitivity to drugs is by far the commonest reported cause (<LINK REF="REF-Roujeau-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roujeau 1995</LINK>). Drugs that are known to trigger such reactions frequently include antimicrobials (such as sulphonamides), allopurinol (a drug used to prevent gout), anticonvulsants (such as phenytoin), and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents (<LINK REF="REF-Revuz-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Revuz 1996</LINK>). Certain infections and immunosuppression may act as predisposing factors to TEN. If a drug precipitates TEN, removal of the offending medication does not always clear the skin and mucous membrane lesions immediately, especially if the drug takes a long time to be cleared from the body. Removal of the offending drug may still be a crucial aspect of disease management, especially for short acting drugs. The exact pathological mechanism of TEN is not known. It has been suggested that people who metabolise certain drugs more slowly than normal may be more prone to drug reactions in general, but whether this is true for TEN remains to be seen. The clinical manifestation of TEN is likely to be mediated by an immunological response of the host rather than a direct toxic action of the drug or its metabolites. Some people who have received a bone marrow transplant have developed a form of TEN, and it is still unclear if this is due to administered drugs, a form of graft-versus-host disease or both (<LINK REF="REF-Villada-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Villada 1990</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Diagnosis</HEADING>
<P>TEN is clinically diagnosed usually by dermatologists. Skin biopsy helps to confirm the diagnosis and also to differentiate it from staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome, a more superficial form of epidermal loss induced by toxins produced by certain strains of the bacterium <I>Staphylococcus aureus</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Revuz-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Revuz 1987</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Clinical features</HEADING>
<P>The onset of TEN can be from a few hours to several weeks depending on the patient's underlying disease and co-medications as well as the suspected drug itself. In affected patients the skin becomes reddened, and large blisters develop quickly (<LINK REF="REF-Revuz-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Revuz 1987</LINK>). Complete death of the epidermis leads to sloughing similar to that seen in an extensive burn. This loss of the epidermis increases the risk of life-threatening infections. The skin failure resulting from this loss leads to loss of fluid and electrolytes which can result in shock. Hypothermia can also develop. TEN usually involves the eyes and the mucous membranes such as the mouth, nose, genitalia and anus.</P>

</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2008-10-22 09:48:56 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Diane A  Horsley">
<P>There is no clear agreement on the treatment for TEN. People with TEN are often treated at burn centres because of extensive loss of skin (<LINK REF="REF-Pruitt-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pruitt 1987</LINK>). Some authors claim this is the only useful treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Halebian-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Halebian 1986</LINK>). Oral steroids (<LINK REF="REF-Stables-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stables 1993</LINK>), immuno suppressants e.g. cyclosporine (<LINK REF="REF-Renfro-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Renfro 1989</LINK>), cyclophosphamide (<LINK REF="REF-Heng-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heng 1991</LINK>), azathioprine (<LINK REF="REF-Bunger-1968" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bunger 1968</LINK>), plasmapheresis (<LINK REF="REF-Sakellariou-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sakellariou 1991</LINK>) and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) (<LINK REF="REF-Viard-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Viard 1998</LINK>) have all been tried in the management of patients with TEN, but it is far from clear whether any of these treatments are effective. A recent study suggests that the death rate among SJS and TEN patients treated with IVIG is even higher than expected from earlier epidemiological studies. In addition, no measurable effect, either on the progression of detachment or on the speed of re-epithelisation, could be determined (<LINK REF="REF-Bachot-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bachot 2001</LINK>). </P>

<P>The included study was a multi-centre randomised double blind placebo controlled trial (<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>). The trial included 22 randomised patients in 2 arms. The treatment arm had 12 patients while the control arm had 10 patients. All patients were over 18 years and had 10 to 90% body surface area of skin loss within the first 4 days since the appearance of the first mucocutaneous symptom. Diagnosis was made on clinical and histopathological evidence.</P>
<P>The intervention was thalidomide 2 x 100 mg twice daily for 5 days as an oral capsule or by nasogastric tube feeding. The placebo was identical in appearance. The outcome measurements were skin detachment and simplified acute physiology score (SAPS) score at five and seven days, and mortality. Plasma and blister fluid tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin six concentration were measured at day zero and day two.</P>
<P>Nine of the 15 patients at a single centre died (60%). This high mortality rate alerted the local investigators who informed the trial coordinator. A safety board of three experts was gathered who first looked at the data without breaking the code. Across all centres, 13 of the 22 patients enrolled had died (59%). A decision to break the code was taken and it was confirmed that the death rate was significantly higher in the thalidomide group. The safety board thus advised that the trial be stopped</P>

<P>The available literature has many contradictory claims of both primary and supportive interventions. There were no controlled trials of supportive therapy and only one controlled trial of primary therapeutic intervention using thalidomide. This study, although well conducted, had to be terminated due to the very high mortality on the treatment arm. The reason for the excess mortality in the thalidomide group of patients in this study is still unclear, although the authors of the study have suggested some possible mechanisms. First, thalidomide might have increased mortality by impairing breathing through a central sedative effect. Second, a chemical messenger called TNF-alpha, which becomes raised in the bloodstream during TEN, might be paradoxically overproduced by thalidomide - a drug thought to prevent TNF-alpha release. This hypothesis was partly supported by the study data.</P>
<P>The study emphasises the dangers of using therapeutic agents based on the study of known mechanisms only and underpins the need for high quality randomised controlled trials in this area using clinical markers (i.e. death, quality of life in survivors) rather than surrogate markers (e.g. blister TNF-alpha levels) as outcome measures.<BR/>Toxic epidermal necrolysis is a rare disease associated with a mortality as high as 30 to 45%. The rarity of the disease makes it difficult (but not impossible) to enrol adequate numbers of participants for randomised controlled trials to obtain conclusive answers. There are also ethical concerns of allocating patients to a treatment arm with possible benefit in a disease with high mortality.</P>
<P>This review did not find any good evidence to support the use of oral steroids, immunoglobulins or cyclosporin A which are commonly used to treat this condition. There are claims and counterclaims of effectiveness of various therapies and supportive treatments in the literature not substantiated by hard evidence. To date, there is no high quality evidence to help doctors, guide patients and the public on what is the most effective treatment for this potentially fatal disease.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>Only one RCT looking at effectiveness of treatments for TEN was available. Thalidomide treatment was not shown to be effective and was associated with significantly high mortality. There is no reliable evidence on commonly used interventions, such as systemic steroids, immunoglobulins and cyclosporin A, for treating TEN, a disease associated with high mortality. </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>More research is required to determine the exact pathophysiology of TEN. Multi-centre, carefully designed, randomised controlled trials are needed, especially to evaluate the effects of treatment with high-dose oral steroids and intravenous immunoglobulins compared against best supportive care. Comparison of standard supportive care in an acute hospital versus care in a special burns unit might also be worthwhile especially if the components of these complex interventions can be adequately defined. Other interventions that might improve prognosis such as early withdrawal of the suspected drug, types of skin care dressing and the role of infection prophylaxis are worthy of further study. Such trials need to take into account the variable severity of the condition as baseline severity may be the largest predictor of outcome. Other research could focus on the management of people who survive the acute phase e.g. by evaluating the impact of different educational strategies for subsequent medication use and modalities to prevent long term complications such as ocular scarring.</P>
